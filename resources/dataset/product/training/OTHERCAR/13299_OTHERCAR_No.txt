            I bought the Accord last year at 99, there were so many choices for me to choose at that time. I thought Honda is a good quality, reliable vehicle because of the previous/currently owned.  
It was pretty good in the first 6 months, but afterward, it started giving me nothing but problems.  First the channel of the window broke twice, then it has an annoying squeezing noise from the brake. The mechanic told me the brake was fine except the edges are touching the rotor and causing the noise, there's no chance to get rid-off the noise or to replace a new one.  
That's okay, but then the interior started bumping me now, the door panel has a gap and giving me some crapping noise also the plastic cover in the map light is likely to yell at me when I am driving.  Those noises are driving me crazy now... 
I think Honda should focus on the quality but not on the quantity.  I am saying my sister's 92 Accord is way better than mine, at least hers got not that many problem as I do!  I mean if we are willing to pay around $20k for a comfortable sedan, these problems shouldn't be happened.<br><br>
