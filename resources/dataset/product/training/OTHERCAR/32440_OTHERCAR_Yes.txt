            Well, with 400 horses, and lighter weigh than an F355, thanks to the all alumni suspension system, this is so far, the best Ferrari I have driven. Actually, I can only say that this is a better car than the F355 and Testarossa.  The moment I sit into this car, I can feel that Ferarri has once again, did their R&amp;D work.  The one I drove is a typical Red/Tan Modena, but it's a F1, therefore, don't have the pleasure of driving a REAL stick-shift car (seems like I don't really have luck driving a real stick shifted Ferrari, the F355 I drove was also an F1).  Anyways...the shift is actually exactly the same as the F355, but I just feel that in the Modena, it's a bit faster reaction time (maybe it's b/c I am biased due to the look of the Modena).  Furthermore, the most noticeble difference would be the engine sound.  But nothing much with the red line, it's 8000 rpm, which is close to what the F355 has.  Also, with (215/45 ZR18) and larger rear tires (275/40 ZR18) mounted on 7.5&quot; and 10&quot; wheels respectively, this car definitely feels it can accelerate laterally with a 1.2g (what the dealer told me, not sure if it's true, but definitely close to how it feels on a Dodge Viper).  Finally, Modena,  also improved a lot in showing that they're trying to improve &quot;passenger comfort&quot; by using compartment in numerous functional elements which become styling elements: the main instrument panel and central console, the tunnel, the pockets in the door panels, the driverï¿½s pedals and the passenger footrest.  Also, MORE SPACE IN THE CAR NOW, FINALLY!!!

     Finally, the best thing is the style.  I just LOVE this car, although this F1 was priced at 220K!!! <br><br>
