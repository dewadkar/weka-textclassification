            I purchased this miniature SUV to replace my Camry XLE.  I thought that the standard version of the vehicle would provide better gas mileage (somewhat) and that I was due for a change from a luxury car to something more zippy.  We have a child, so safety was paramount; we believed that the Rav offered that safety, and we were proven correct (more on that later).  The price we paid for what we received in the Rav4 was fair: standard transmission, electric windows and moon roof, CD player, hard covered spared tire, all for about 22K.  The one thing that I wish we had paid extra for was the keyless entry.  Because we have a small child, I often need to be able to unlock the car while holding my child.  Because I must use a key to physically unlock the door every time I want to open the door, I must take extra measures.  Also, I can never remember which way to turn the key, so I spend extra time reinserting the key when the first try does not unlock the door.  Several times my child has wandered off beyond my sight while I am fussing with the door lock.  Keyless entry should be standard on all Toyota products.  
Other than this, the Rav4 is a spree to drive.  The car is small, so everything is reachable from the driver's seat (even the BACK seat!)  A tiny CD holder in the console holds about 10 CDs and there are other small storage spaces in front of the CD box.  There are two adjustable cup holders in the front for a variety of beverage sizes, and a single cup holder in the back, but it is almost on the floor.  The gadgets on the Rav4 work well, and respond to a light touch.  The trunk space is small, but will hold ten day�s worth of groceries for a family of three, three or four gym bags, or a day�s worth of toys for the beach.  The back seats hold two passengers, and can hold up to three if they people know each other well (!).  It cannot hold more than two children�s car seat�s however.  There is not ample room.  The number one problem with the vehicle, and this is unusual, is that when the back window is down, a loud warbling sound is produced.  This is alleviated by opening the moon roof, but it should not have to be so.  I have not found a reason for the warbling with one window down and I have accepted this as a fault of a less-than-expensive car.  
My Rav4 was mightily tested a few months ago when I was hit from behind by a large vehicle going 45 miles per hour.  My child and I were unhurt, and the car sustained little damage.  The impact was apparently absorbed by the hard covered tire, the door under the tire, and the bumper.  The damage was about 800.00 to fix the door, replace the tire cover, remount it, and paint various parts.  The entire front bumper of the car that hit me was destroyed.  I suppose that is an endorsement for the Rav4 in extreme situations.  
Over all, it is a nice little car to have for tooling around town, but I would not care to take extra long trips in it; it�s too small with limited seat features.  I would buy it again for sure.
