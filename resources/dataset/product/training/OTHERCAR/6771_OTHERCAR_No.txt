            I bought a 1997 Breeze in 1998.  The car had about 30,000 miles it. I owned this car for a year and had very bad luck with it.  I don't know if it was this particular car or the Breeze itself.  I have two friends that also owned Breezes and they had the same experiences.  I was attracted to this car because of the sporty looks.  The Breeze is a very classy looking car and has plenty of leg room, but the problems I endured out weighed the good looks of the car. Two months after the warranty ran out on this car it blew a head gasket.  The car was repaired, but it never ran the same again.  Next the fuel pump went out on the car.  We decided to get rid of the car before any more happened.  The trade in value on the Breezes are not good.  We received $5500.00 less on the trade in than what we paid for the car when it was purchased. Remember we only owned this car for a year and did not put dents, scratches, or high mileage on this car.<br><br>
