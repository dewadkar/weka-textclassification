            When I bought my 1999 2-door Pontiac Grand Am SE this summer, I was expecting an inferior car, due to the fact that it was much cheaper than the competition (with General Motors' rebates and special incentives.)  I was pleasantly surprised with the solid ride and the quick acceleration of the 4-cylinder engine.  It is actually a nimble and comfortable vehicle.  So far, I have just 2 complaints.  First, if you look carefully around the interior you can notice that the quality of the vehicle is not what you would get from Honda or Volkswagen.  Things don't seems to fit as well.  For example, underneath the dash, the plastic was cut and installed somewhat carelessly.  The edge is a little jagged and a screw fell out.  While disconcerting, it is not glaringly obvious.  Also, driving over bumpy roads reveals that things are beginning to squeak. Second, the fact that the rear seats don't fold down and the high lift-over of the trunk do not make this car ideal for most types of cargo.  Though, seats fold down in the more expensive models.
Though far from being the epitome of workmanship and quality, the car is very nice to drive and priced very well compared to the competition.  Furthermore, I am very happy with the gas mileage I've been getting, too.
