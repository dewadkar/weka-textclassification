                 Basically i bought this car because my old one died and i had to have transportation.  Being a single mom I want something reliable and economic.  And boy is this car economic!!!!  I love the fact that I can maintain the car without going into debt.  It goes everywhere, and i mean everywhere, from the cities of north carolina to the woods of up state ny.  I wouldn't suggest taking it off road but we have on a few occasions!!!
     The car is small, but we have fit 2 adults, 3 children and a full size dog in it along with luggage for a 2 week vacation.  What other vehicle can go to North Carolina on $23.00 worth of gas.  
     In my opinion this is an awesome little car.  Mine has never gotten stuck in the snow or mud.  It is very good on gas.  And easily maintained.  New tires cost me about $18.00 a piece, and that was the 70,000 mile ones.
     This car handles extremely well given it's size.  I have a standard model and it has terrific pick up.  Being soo small the wind seems to push it around a little bit, but not bad.
     This vehicle is perfect for a new family or for someone who is concerned about economy.
     If you are looking for roomy, luxury this is not the car for you.  Personally i am in love with my little go cart and plan to keep it as long as possible.
     I would definitely recommend this car
