                My Mitsubishi Galant was the first car I've ever owned (I'm only 17)It was purchased for me in August of 2001.  When we bought the car, the salesperson said Mitsubishi's were known for bad transmissions.  My transmission works fine.  When you first turn on the car, (before the engine heats up) thats the only time the gears change hard.
     Currently, I have 149,000 miles on the car. Within a few months of owning it, it began to hesitate once you have to have a quick acceleration or merging.This is due to a faulty fuel injector.  I had to get the steering Ball joints fixed (free)because their was a safty recall from the manufacturer.  When I bought the car the A/C was inoperative, and a new air compressor costs over $400.00 from the dealership! 
       Within the time owning the car (from August '01), the recirculator started making a clicking noise when off, as well as the indicator light went out.  Also, the cruise control indicator light, and the Hazard Light switch died out as well after normal use (both new switches cost $35 at the dealership).
       All in all, the ride is smooth, and quiet and even at very high speeds, this car cuts through the wind like a hot knife through butter and it can really sail, with little wind noise.
       This model Galant is a relatively attractive sedan, with ample pickup due to its 2.4L 141hp 4 inline cylinder, 4 speed automatic tranny.  I can still have a burnout!Braking is fair and the handling is exeptional! It feels rather solid through turns and drives very safe with dual front passenger airbags.
        I reccomend this sturdy little car to any teen as a first car! I've had absolutly no problems with it exept the ones listed above. It tends to have a shoddy electrical system but otherwise it gets me where I need to go very well.
