            	The Mercedes-Benz C 280 is indubitably one of the best cars you can buy for less than $40,000. Although not as powerful as its C 43 sister, she still has plenty of muscle under the hood for those times when you need a little kick in the pants. Sporty, but luxurious and quiet on the interior, the C class sedans handle beautifully, swaying very little around corners, and begging to be taken to the limit. It is fast, but easy to drive, and just sheer pleasure to be in. (The automatic shifting is so smooth it's creepy!)
	With plenty of features to go around, don't be led off by the sportiness of this car--there are plenty of luxuries, from the Bose audio system to the cleverly retractable cup holders, everything about the interior pampers the driver and passenger, although admittedly not allowing for a tremendous amount of leg-room in the rear seats.
	The car, like all Mercedes, is also incredibly safe, with side airbags, ALS traction control (which can be turned off for some fun!), and a whole list of other features, it would be difficult to injure oneself in this automobile.
	All in all, this car is attractive, sporty, and luxurious--a definite buy for the &lt;$35,000 sedan category!<br><br>
