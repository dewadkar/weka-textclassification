            After my recent crash I've been looking at new cars. For several years I've drooled over the cute little PT Cruiser but I can't and won't learn how to drive a stick.

 Today hubby and I went and test drove a new Camry which was nice and looked at a Lexus ES300 which were basically the same car car but on our way out of the Auto Mall I saw the car! It spoke to me. Sitting all alone on the corner was a bright purple PT Cruiser Touring Edition. I had to stop and see what the difference was between that and the Classic Edition.

With the touring edition  you can choose between a manual 5 speed or an automatic 4 speed transmission! Oh joy! I got out and took it for a spin. It handled beautifully. There was no road noise and it just seemed to glide down the road. 

I came home with brochures from all the cars we looked at today and did some research. I'm looking for a very safe car that's not too expensive, too big or too small.
All the cars I looked at seem very sturdy, and have several safety options. Airbags, Side airbags. 

 The PT Cruiser also has low speed traction control, ABS, MacPherson strut front suspension, twist-beam axle, guided by trailing arms and a Watt's linkage ( For easy cornering), Less forceful airbags ( to help prevent broken noses), optional you can get side airbags to protect your head and neck, steel panels throughout the car for better impact protection, steel door beams, transverse beam, also additional options include Knee blockers, ( wish my other car had that I now have to have knee surgery due to the crash I had last month),Head-impact provisions are built into the uppertrim panels, helping protect your head in a crash.

Chrysler is also running a nice incentive for college students. If you buy a PT Cruiser before 3/31/02  you get $400.00
The other incentive is low interest financing. 3.9%-5.9% depending on your credit. The web site also has a monthly payment calculator and a finance center.
The PT Cruiser Touring Edition with automatic transmission and destination charge came to $19,415.00. With $5,000.00 down I can finance the car for 60 months and my payments would be $240.00 month.
My mind has been made up. I'm buying a new PT Cruiser Touring Edition this week.
