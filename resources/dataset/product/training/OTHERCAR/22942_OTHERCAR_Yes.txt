            I bought this vehicle based on the outstanding record many of my friends and family have had with Honda automobiles.  I love the gas mileage, ride comfort, and reliability of this vehicle.  One of the only things about this vehicle I don't like is the air conditioning. I have read that it was a design flaw in the ventilation  system in these model years.  I would have also liked if this car was offered in a V-6 model, for the extra power.  At the same time I would not call it underpowered.It works fine, but doesn't get quite as cold as I might like.  This car is easy to drive, and feels comfortable at any speed.  I would encourage anyone to buy this car.  The only exception I would see might be to a family since it is only a two door.  <br><br>
