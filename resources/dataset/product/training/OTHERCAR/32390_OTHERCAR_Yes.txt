            Why should you buy this vehicle you ask???? I got one word for yah...RELIABLE.  This car is the biggest pleasure to drive.  It handles the road suberbly and gives the driver much needed comfort.  I am 5'11 and fit with no problem (plenty of head room and leg room).  This car is very fuel economic (10 bucks to fill it up @ 250 miles).  It has a very sporty look and aero dynamic design.  When you buy a HONDA you not only buy a great car you become part of the HONDA family.  This family is notorious for good service, good value, and a long line dedicated quality.  The HONDA CIVIC EX delivers just that for an afforable price of $15,500 (loaded). yup that means CD and sun roof.  

So the next time you are in the market for a car BUY A HONDA CIVIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you wont be dissapointed and neither will the person be that gets it after you (the resale value is TREMENDOUS).

think HONDA
