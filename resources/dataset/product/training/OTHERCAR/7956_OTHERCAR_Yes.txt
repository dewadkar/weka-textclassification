            Currently I own a 1997 Sahara that I purchased used for $16,000 with only 26,000 miles on it. This is my third Jeep. I previously owned a 94 soft top and a 95 hard top. While the hard top was quieter while driving on the highway, the hoisting of that bad boy on and off proved to be way to much for me by myself. It is true that Jeeps are not the most fuel efficient vehicle and that they may not have all the extras that people are looking for, but to own one is to love one.

I won't lie and say that this vehicle is for everyone. There is a certain kind of person that can drive a Jeep. While it is great to have a convertible that can go through the snow unlike any other, it does have a few draw backs. Jeeps are high off the ground and fairly loud inside while you are driving. The notion that they are cold in the winter is a myth. There are several times I found myself turning the heat down in the winter and that's in Illinois. There is only limited space behind the rear seat, so if you are needing to haul something larger, you may need to remove the back seat. I do have a family and this is not a vehicle to take on vacations. If you are worried about a comfy ride I highly recommend looking at a 97 or later model. The new suspension has worked wonders over what my 94 and 95 models had (the power of finally stepping up to the 4.0 liter is pretty impressive as well).  

If you are looking for a fun vehicle that's great for off-roading and super in the winter, this is the vehicle for you. There are many copies, but none are as good as the original. If you're not sure whether or not you are ready to join the Jeep Club, then a test drive should let you know whether or not this is the vehicle for you.   <br><br>
