            That was the deciding factor for purchasing this camera. I still believe that your camera is only as good as what it can see and that is what the Sony F505V offers. A Carl Zeiss lens with a 5x optical zoom.

My husband and I have been wanting a new digital camera for a while now, so when we got a nice bonus from his employer, that was it, we were off to the Good Guys to choose between this camera and the Nikon Coolpix 990.

Besides the lens (need I say more), we liked the optional memory stick floppy adapter (not included) which makes it easy to download to any computer. 
It also has AV jacks (cable included) for viewing on your TV or on the road in a hotel room. 
One of the features (and there are many) we like a lot is the email mode. Along with the resolution you choose for the picture it will also save a small email size picture. Great for the grandparents.

No one camera out there has all the features that we wanted in a camera.  So there are trade offs. We really wanted a real viewfinder, the LCD on the 505V just does not cut it. The glare can be most annoying (the swivel LCD does help a bit as does the LCD adjustable light). The memory stick is nice and small but no real grips on it to get it out of the camera easily.
The memory stick included with the camera is 8 meg, so it is necessary to buy another. We went with the 64 meg at an extra $140. Ka ching!!
Then another battery is a necessity at $80. Ka ching, ka ching!!!

But, I do have a wonderful lens.<br><br>
