            Recently had a major service in my car and the dealer gave me a Chevrolet Cavalier to drive for a week. Here are my thoughts...

This is a nice car for the money. It is roomy, looks good, is comfortable and has a fair amount of features. You can also get it with a larger engine which could help make it more attractive.

I liked the highway driving as it felt like a bigger car in some ways. It held well up to about 70MPH and above that the engine and the car star making too much noise for me to feel safe. Granted it is not designed for high speed. But a little more stability at high speed would be nice...

It is not VW so forget about tight handling. It wobbles around and feels a little soft. Has as much body roll as a VW Golf but less precision in steering and less road feel.

Overall this is a reasonable commuter car. More cute than well engineered. I would say that it may sell more due to the looks and price than anything else. But they should do a better job in some areas. More on that...

There were some things I did not like. The car is noisy, there seems to be almost no insulation from the engine compartment. Above 3,500RPM it is like being in a steel plant... I have found this to be the case in other small American cars like the Saturns. The Germans and the Japanese do a better job here in this class of car.

Also the plastics and interior materials look cheap. Almost as cheap as the Chrysler stuff. Not as good as other GM cars. And the build quality does not seem like a priority here. Car had 1000 miles when I first got it and I could already hear some pretty loud rattling noises... Again, not a VW...

Finally I thought this car was a little slow and could use more punch. But then again as a commuter it should be alright. And you can get it with a larger engine. Mine was the standard 4 cyl.

And as for the pros and cons...

<b>PROS: </b>Roomy, comfortable commuter, cute styling, cheap to buy and operate

<b>CONS:</b> Really Noisy, cheap quality for class, Slow off the line, unstable at high speeds

IF you like the styling or the GM incentives this is a good buy. But look at the Saturn, Honda, Toyota and VW options. They may be better buys even if costing a little more.
