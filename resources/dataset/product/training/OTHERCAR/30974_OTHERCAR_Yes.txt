            In 1967 Pontiac Motor Division created the Firebird, their entry in the fledgling "pony-car" market initiated by Ford's Mustang.  Thirty years later, the Firebird (and its more potent older brother, Trans Am) has matured into one America's finest examples of V8-powered sport coupe performance. General Motors has have voted to discontinue this legendary performance machine after the 2002 model year, but for anyone considering picking up a used machine, this one comes with my absolute highest recommendation. You will never have this much fun (for less than $30 grand) in your life.

Since June 26th, 1998, I have loved every minute of owning this car. I special-ordered a WS6 Ram Air-equipped Trans Am from the factory in '98, and took delivery in June. It is my first Trans Am. These cars have been in my family since 1975, and there are three still there today -- including the black Ram Air I bought following my graduation from high school.

In the following sections, I'll highlight some of the vehicle's pluses and minuses.

<b>PROs</b>
-------------------------------------------------------

<b>Performance</b>
It's the name of the game here, and Pontiac knows it. You'll get power in spades the instant you mash down on the throttle. Whether equipped with an automatic or manual transmission, it's easy to chirp the tires between gears -- and you can easily immolate the rear tires entirely with a few overenthusiastic burnouts. There is enough torque here to get you motivated from a dead stop in third gear!

For the Ram Air-equipped Trans Am, horsepower is 320 and torque is 335 lb-ft. The LS1 V8 (also used in the Chevrolet Corvette) is eager to accept aftermarket performance modifications, and you can squeeze more juice out of the Trans Am with ease on even a tight budget. That's the beauty of the American pushrod V8: It's oh, so easy to ramp up the power.

<b>Sound</b>
I was born and raised in Detroit, and in my humble opinion there is no sweeter sound than the growls, rumbles and roars of a V8 engine. The unmitigated scream of those eight cylinders at wide open throttle is more than enough to get my blood flowing every day. The '98 WS6s came equipped with a free-flowing, 3" one-on-the-left exhaust tip, which I have since replaced with a Borla cat-back system. Even stock, however, the sound is menacing, and a real treat for car enthusiasts. Although the engine is aluminum and therefore quieter than the iron blocks of the earlier T/As, the LS1 will not leave you wanting in the sound department.

<b>Looks & Design</b>
The Trans Am means business. That much you can tell just by looking at it. You may think that perhaps it's more flamboyancy than actual function, but rest assured that every one of those scoops and ports on the front end actually serves a purpose. Some folks feel the design is over-the-top, but if so, then that's what I like. When Pontiac redesigned the Firebird for '98, the car's looks had somewhat of a polarizing effect -- either love it or hate it. I love it.

<b>Fuel Economy</b>
I can imagine what you're thinking now: "What are you talking about? This is an American V8-powered sports coupe. Fuel economy is a moot point!" Actually, it's not. Particularly when equipped with the 6-speed manual gearbox, you can reach astonishing mileage figures with this performance machine. The '98 Firebird's fuel tank is small at only around 11 gallons or so (it was increased to 16 gallons for '99), but I find myself getting gas only once a week -- and that's with all city driving. On the highway you can attain 27 MPG! There are four-cylinder SUVs available which get less than that.

<b>CONs</b>
-------------------------------------------------------

<b>Workmanship</b>
The Firebird and Trans Am are not perfect machines. They have the power to excite the soul, but you pay for it every so often with maintenance issues. I am currently on my third Monsoon stereo receiver unit -- the other two had LCD display problems. I've had a headlight motor gear fail (a simple fix), a bearing in the rear end go bad, and a wide variety of peculiar sounds both inside and out that I can easily attribute to poor design. The interior of the car is more business than pleasure; there aren't a lot of frills, and the material used throughout the cockpit is mostly of average quality plastic. (Don't miss what some have called the "mouse fur" headliner.) Still, all the repairs I've had done have been relatively minor, and all covered under warranty.

Speaking of which, you'll want to purchase an extended warranty for this car if you can. I extended mine an additional three years. You should not expect Toyota-like reliability when you buy a Trans Am -- but you should also not consider its workmanship to be generally indicitave of Pontiac's other products. Indeed, product quality has improved dramatically all throughout GM in the last several years. I've driven new Grand Ams, Grand Prixs and Bonnevilles that felt as solid as BMWs. But remember that GM had abandoned the Firebird and Camaro by 1996 or 1997 -- knowing even then that the cars would be discontinued in 2002. R&D stopped altogether and product improvement on the Trans Am was scaled way back. That can explain many of the car's shortcomings, although not all. What it comes down to is: Are you willing to pay the price for all that power, those looks, that prestige on the street? I was, and I never regret having purchased this car.


<b>BOTTOM LINE</b>
-------------------------------------------------------
For people of all ages looking for Corvette performance at a budget price, you can't go wrong with Trans Am. A car by that name may never see showroom floors again, so if you're intrigued by the Firebird, you'd best buy one now. If you have a passion for driving; if it means more to you than getting from Point A to Point B...you will truly enjoy your Firebird.
