            I must say that I was quite impressed with this camera!  From its ample LCD screen to its various picture sizes, it's really a great steal.  The pictures came out crisp and clear, while the color was well-defined with no bleeding.  I also had a chance to use the optional printer, which printed out almost film-like postcards.

The camera uses SmartMedia cards, so there are no moving parts to mess you up.  It has a nice feature that takes 10 photos continuously in a total of 5 seconds -- and afterward, just browse through the easy-to-use menu and erase unwanted pictures on-the-fly!

It has a maximum resolution of 1280x960, but that should be more than sufficient for the average person.  And for the most discriminating user, TIFF format (uncompressed) is available instead of JPEG (compression with a slight loss in quality).

The LCD view screen is updated in real-time, so you can take pictures without looking into the small eye-hole.  Also, this real-time preview can be sent directly to a TV -- so you can set up a photo booth where people can actually see the picture before taking it.  Quite nice.

I only have two complaints about the camera.  1) I dropped it once, and the small tab that covers the S-video/serial-outs broke off.  2) Camera can't zoom -- digital zoom = cropping the picture, which means no zooming. <br><br>
