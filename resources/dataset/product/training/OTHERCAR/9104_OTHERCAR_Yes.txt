I purchased my sportage this summer and I am basically satisfied. 
One of the little things you don't notice when shopping around is windshield wipers. These only have two speeds and on light rainy days 
it gets bothersome having to turn them on and off so often.
You also have to unlock the hatch every time you want in it which can 
get old.

If you need 4 wheel drive and can't afford the big ticket blazers, explorers etc. then this is the way to go. It is easy to put into and 
take out of 4 wheel drive and it will give you that extra control on bad weather days.
