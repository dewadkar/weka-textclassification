I�d like to begin this by saying that I bought this camera right after it came out in December of last year, and it has taken Epinions clear up until now to actually include this camera on their site.  They used to have a feature where to could recommend new products for them to add to be rated, but in the whirlwind of new changes the site has had, most of them bad, this feature went the way of the dinosaur.  One good thing about waiting to review this product for nearly a year is that I really got a handle on its features, and I�m sure that it is a durable product that won�t break after a month.  The  bad thing is that Epinions could have had member reviews on this product back when it was new, and people were actually interested in buying it.  Now that this camera is no longer the latest and greatest, Epinions missed the boat.  Ahhh, well...they�re way too busy not paying out my e-royalties to bother with new products, right?  

I want to start this review of by making something clear; I am not an electronics geek, so I don�t have a wealth of measurements, figures and statistics to give you when detailing the performance of this camera.  With me, a piece of electronic equipment either works, or it doesn�t.  I will flip through the manual to gain information on some of the more complex features, but in my opinion a truly user-friendly device will work right out of the box, and work well.  Forgive me for not including shutter speeds, how many mega-pixels are in the pictures, or at what rate the data transfers to the computer, because I just don�t give a damn.  With this camera, taking pictures is easy, the pictures look great, and transferring them to my computer for storage and editing is a snap, and that�s all that matters with me.  If you are the type that gets aroused by numbers, check out HP�s web site for the cold, hard facts.

The first comments I always hear about the HP Photosmart 912 when I first pull it out is that it doesn�t look like a digital camera, and save for the LCD screen on the back, it doesn�t.  It has an adjustable Pentax lens and the molded body style of more conventional film cameras.  I think HP gave it this particular design with experienced photographers in mind, since some might be frightened away from digital cameras in part because of their radical designs.  For someone familiar with a more conventional camera, the 912 does offer traditional design and accessibility, so the thought of going digital might not be so horrifying for some.  The design and the manipulation of the Pentax lens, however, is where the similarities with a film camera end.  The 912 offers an array of flexible features that are both easy to use and easy to get used to.  Granted, film will always offer advantages that you just can�t get digital to do without manipulating the image later on your computer, but digital has already made leaps and bounds to catch up with its ancient competitor, and the 912 is a living testament to that.  

The first thing I found myself playing around with on the 912 was shutter speeds.  The first few pictures I took with the camera were horribly blurry, with the slightest motion showing up as a huge streak on the picture.  I figured out that out of the box, the shutter speed was set really low, for some odd reason.  This seems extremely retarded to me; why in the world would people want their first pictures to be blurry, smeared affairs that could persuade them that a digital camera was a bad idea, and that they want their money back?  It was unfortunate that I discovered this out-of-the-box flaw while taking pictures at my sister�s wedding, which was about 2 days after I bought the camera.  I was horrified to discover that every picture was smeared and blurry.  However, I quickly discovered the problem, fixed the shutter speed, and started taking clear pictures after that.  My priceless pictures of my sister�s wedding were nonetheless useless.  Live and learn, I guess.  Never, ever take priceless pictures with a camera that you have never used before.  

One other feature that you will have to get used to on this camera is that after adjusting the lens, it is best to push down the action button halfway, so the automatic digital zoom will further clear up the image.  If you get a little hasty and don�t take this extra half-second of effort, the digital zoom will tend to be a little off, and your picture may be a little blurry because of it.  Once you get the routine down, however, the pictures rarely fail to be crisp and great-looking.  As with most new gadgets, you just have to get used to its little intricacies;  film cameras also have their strange little quirks, it�s just a matter of getting used to your camera�s personality before taking pictures.  

As far as the HP�s LCD screen goes, everything is pretty much laid out in foolproof style and in plain English.  You will find that you can navigate through the camera�s menus in Windows style, so the format should be instantly familiar to people who have used Windows.  A small arrow-key button on the back of the camera is used to guide you through the various screens and menus, and I�ve found it to be comfortable and instantly familiar; anyone who has used a PDA will know how to skip around menus using a little arrow-key pad.  The controls themselves in the menus are also laid out in foolproof style so that no matter what feature you are looking for, you can find it easily and understand how to change it.  I have yet to get stuck for very long when trying to figure out how to change a feature on the camera.  For those of you who just can�t figure something out, the camera comes with a user�s manual on a CD-ROM, so a few clicks of your mouse will lead you to the proper page, set up in Adobe Acrobat format, so printing out frequently-used pages is a breeze.  I really prefer the CD-ROM manual setup myself, since I tend to hang on to CD�s easier than owner�s manuals, for some reason.  

The 912 also comes with software for several picture-editing programs, including Adobe Photoshop Business Edition, which is, in a word, NIIIIICE!  I want to do a separate review on this version of Photoshop later on, I�m so impressed with it.  My hard drive on my computer is bogged down with tons of photo-editing software because I have found that most programs excel in one area, while being deficient in another.  For instance, in one program, I will find that it is really easy to add text to a picture and crop it.  However, that same software can�t convert my pictures do a different format very well.  I�ll then have to open up a different program to convert the picture, and yet another to add special effects, etc.  Adobe Photoshop Business Edition ends all of that; I can do whatever I want to a picture including cropping, converting, adding effects, text, etc. without leaving the comfortable confines of one program.  Photoshop also works well in conjunction with the 912�s software, so once you download your pictures from the camera, they can be seamlessly transferred to Photoshop and edited with no hassle.  They also transfer to the computer as very large pictures, for you to size down if you wish with no distortion.  In an age when it�s nearly impossible to find two pieces of software from two different companies that don�t conflict with each other, this is very nice to see.  

The actual act of transferring your pictures from the camera to the computer is very easy; there is a small USB port on the side of the camera.  Just plug the included USB cable in there, and the other end into your computer�s USB port.  The HP software will immediately start up and ask you  if you want to transfer the pictures.  The actual transfer only takes about a second per picture, and then your camera�s memory is empty again for you to take more pictures.  Compared to changing film and waiting to get it developed, I can�t put into words how nice this is.  If there is no other reason in the world to own a digital camera, instant access to your pictures has got to be it for me.  I still have rolls of film from a trip to England I took in 1995, for God�s sake.  I would have already looked at all the pictures, edited them, added text and emailed to all of my relatives already if I would have had the 912 back then.  

The 912 has a wealth of features, many of which I have yet to even use, but I will tell you about them just the same because this is a product review.  You of course get the flexibility of a normal film camera with features like being able to adjust the shutter speed, as well as adjusting the camera for different lighting situations.  There is a dial on top of the camera that you will recognize from �normal� cameras.  It has different settings represented by different little icons for each occasion.  For instance, there is a little mountain to signify outdoor pictures, a little skier to represent sports and other fast-paced events, etc.  These do make a vast difference in the quality of the image you are taking, so you will want to be sure to experiment with the different settings before running out to be the next Ansel Adams.  There is also an odd little feature that lets you record a short message to be attached to a picture.  I can�t think of much a use for this, except for putting, �this is when we were in San Francisco,� to go along with your picture of the Golden Gate Bridge.  But since you can also put in a text tag to go along with the picture, this feature seems a little useless to me.  However, you might find some use for it, and I�m sure it works just fine.  

The camera also comes along with a tiny little remote control that allows you to snap the ever-important family portrait, and the camera can also be set on a timer as well.  The remote is very small, and can fit in your hand, so your picture will not show the remote, or any wires.  There is also a feature on the 912 that allows you to take a series of pictures in rapid succession, in order to play them back like a slide show.  I have honestly never found a real use for this feature, but again, I�m sure it works great and someone might actually have a legitimate use for it.  There is a slot for adding a memory card, and the standard one that comes with the camera will hold 28 on the highest quality, more if you lower the quality a little.  You have the option of adding bigger memory cards capable of holding up to 80 pictures.  Honestly, this would be the longest review ever if I went into every single feature that this jam-packed little do-dad had.  

If there is really a con to owning the 912, it would have to be battery life.  Believe me, you will want to invest the $20 in a good battery charger and a set of re-chargeable batteries.  This thing eats them like M&M�s.  There is a feature on the camera where the LCD screen shows what is being viewed through the lens, like a camcorder, and this feature eats up batteries more than any other feature on the camera.  The flash does as well, though you will get a lot more flashes out of it than you will time with the LCD screen on.  Science has yet to discover a way to make cool digital devices energy efficient, and until they do, we just have to put up with charging batteries constantly.  There is a handy little gauge that shows in the main window on the top of the camera to let you know how much power you have left, so you will never be left with a dead camera when you really need it.  

Aside from the hefty price tag (about $750 - $800) there is really no reason not to get the HP Photosmart 912.  It is digital, takes great pictures, offers a wide range of flexible features that rival those of a film camera, and even has all of the cool accessories that you would expect for a film camera, including telephoto lenses, special filters, and tripods, all of which are included in a catalog along with the camera.  If you want to venture into the world of digital photography, but are a little scared of trying something new, the 912 is very user-friendly and will hold your hand while you learn the ins and outs.  If you a seasoned pro, the 912 might also surprise you with its flexibility and quality pictures.
