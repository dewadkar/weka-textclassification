            The 1988 Mazda RX-7 Turbo II is perhaps one of the best "bang for buck" deals available today for an auto-enthusiast.

Although being somewhat old, this car can still hold it's own with more contemporary sport coupes.  This car came  with Mazda's 13B Rotary Engine and when equipped with a turbocharger, was able to muster out 182bhp@6500rpm and 183ft/lb of torque@4000rpm; allowing this car to achieve acceleration times of 6.8second 0-60mph and 14.4second 1/4mile respectively.  Without modifications, the car is surprisingly quiet.  For the auto-enthusiast who is not satisfied with these power figures and is not concerned about noise levels, achieving higher numbers is quite easy to do.  Add an aftermarket intake filter, along with a larger diameter exhaust and 220-240hp is easily realized.

The OEM Recaro seats use a low seating position which may require some getting used.  Although this is not anything that should stop a serious buyer from making a purchase.  The clock/warning light cluster is easier to read than the earlier models after Mazda tinted the screen.  Interior highlights such as the easy to read gauges featuring a large center-mounted tachometer, leather wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel and easy to reach shifter will assure skeptics that this is in fact, a sports car.

On the downside, owning this car, I've realized that it's plagued with small electrical bugs.  The most common being the failure of the windshield wiper switch and warning light cluster.  These problems are merely due to the age of these cars and can be easily fixed.  The wiper switch by replacing defective relays and the clock/warning light cluster by re-soldering the soldering points.

This is a car that you cannot take to just any mechanic, so unless you have unlimited amounts of cash, be prepared to do a lot of the work yourself if you purchase this car.  RX-7s have always been an enthusiasts car.
