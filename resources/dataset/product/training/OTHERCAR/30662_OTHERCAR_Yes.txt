            My wife and I purchased an off-lease 1997 Grand Cherokee 4WD in February of 1999, and have driven about 30,000 miles on it in the past two years without a single problem - we absolutely love the Sport Ute!

When looking at SUV's before buying our Jeep, we took test drives of some of the favorites.  The Explorer drove like a custom van, the Blazer felt too cheap/toyish, but the Jeep felt like a real mountain climber that handled VERY well and felt very safe.  It's no wonder, Jeeps have been through world wars, and have visited the most dangerous of terrain.  

My mother originally purchased a Grand Cherokee in 1992 and has since put 150,000 miles on her's without a major repair to be made.  This was probably the final deciding factor - as we absolutely hate to pay for a vehicle that sees the auto techs more than the road.  We haven't regretted our decision once!

Our GC handles exceptionally well on all road types, and is a dream on snow.  Granted, we don't get a lot of snow here in Indiana, but when we do, the 4WD works like a charm.  The ABS has saved us a couple of times now, and is VERY able when needed - I was actually impressed that I felt so in control despite the conditions.

The fit and finish to the interior as well as the exterior seem very well manufactured and assembled.  The car has seen almost 4 years now, and still looks/sounds/rides like new (I recently drove my fathers 2000 GC at Thanksgiving and it felt very similar).  Many of the creaks and cracks which I have been accustomed to in GM products are non-existent here, a testament to the quality of manufacture of this vehicle.

The only complaint I have is with my local Jeep service department.  They claim they are one of those 5-star certified dealers, but it takes me a month to get in for an oil change, and if there is something that needs to be tweaked with the vehicle, they claim nothing is wrong although I know better.  I wish I lived in a bigger city that had more than one Jeep dealer, but until then I'll have to live with this annoyance.<br><br>
