            In 1997 I purchased a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am GT 4 door.  The car looked to be in excellent shape and only had 17,000 miles on it.  I took the car for a test drive and, being only 18, I thought this was a great car.
The first thing that went wrong with this car was my fault.  I wrecked it, nearly totalling it 3 days after I bought it.  It spent two weeks in the shop, but when I got it back it ran just great.

After having the car for six months, I took it into the dealership where I bought it and learned I needed new brakes.  They tried to tell me this wasnt covered under the extended warranty, that it was normal wear and tear.  Not knowing if the previous owners had replaced the brakes, I said fine and paid for front and rear brakes.  Six thousand miles later, the car needed brakes again!  Once again, they told me it was normal wear and tear and it was not covered.  I fought with them for a month before the dealership finally ate the cost of the brakes and replaced them.  The car has had to be repainted twice because the paint has chipped so bad, it has had three new alternators, four sets of brakes (about once every 6,000 miles), and two new air conditioners.  
When driving down an interstate (like I do every day to get to work), the car shakes so bad and makes so much noise it is unbearable.  

Overall, I would say there is nothing &quot;Grand&quot; about the 1994 Pontiac Grand Am.  Other friends own newer and older models and have had very few problems, but the common problem has been the brakes they put on these cars.  Don't waste your money or your time on this car.<br><br>
