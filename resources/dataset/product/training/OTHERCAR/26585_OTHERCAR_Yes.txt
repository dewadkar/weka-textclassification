            One of the most dramatic changes in the 2003 4Runner must be the highly evolved body contours. At last the 4Runner has moved beyond "trucklike" into a stylish multi-purpose vehicle. My last car was a Mercedes ML 320 and through it I got to know every single technician in the dealers service department. Mainly because of NUMEROUS rattles and part failures which required continuous visits back and forth to service. I didn't want to go through that again. So I focused my attention on three well rated vehicles, the Honda Pilot, and the Toyota Highlander and 2003 4Runner. I test drove all three and really liked the Highlander and the Pilot. I initially felt the 4Runner had a bulky feel to it. But, after I drove the "Sport" model with the X-REAS suspension my opinion changed. Honda dealers will not negotiate the price of the Pilot down by one penny and almost all options are extra, and they quickly add up. Also, the Pilot is not available with a sun roof. The Highlander drove superbly and felt like a quality sedan. The main drawback was it was a little on the tame side and had somewhat of a minivan feel to it.

After I drove the 2003 4Runner 6 cyl Sport I knew I had found my vehicle. Mercedes Benz would be lucky if they could come up with an suv that drives this well! The Sport suspension makes a big difference in handling. But that is just one component of a really nicely assembled package. The interior space is very well thought out. It is ergonomically comfortable and has the space earlier 4Runners lacked. The fit and finish is really excellent. The controls and interior components look sharp. The seats are manually adjusting, but it doesn't take long to find  a comfortable position. Plus, there is a power lumbar adjustment.The factory stereo is outstanding. This 4Runner came equipped with lighted vanity mirrors which some models don't seem to have.

So far I have only driven only a few hundred miles but already I have driven through blinding snow and rain as well as deep, freshly fallen snow. Watch out, this car will plow right through and not miss a beat. At all times it has felt secure, warm, and comfortable. Bad weather performance shines.  I just wish I could have kept that new car clean appearance at least a few days before confronting the winter elements. The 6cyl. gas mileage has been decent, an important factor to consider with the price of gas rising daily.
