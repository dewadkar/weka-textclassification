            Long time photographer, much experience with Nikon SLR, although most recently with Olympus.  I waited for the megapixel cameras, and was mesmerized by the first megapixel Nikon images.  The appeal in the camera is more than the images, however.  My experience with Nikon has been that the things are built like Mercedes; solid, consistent feel, and a good product.  Despite the cutesy name, that is how the camera is.  

Very easy to pick up and use.  I had a relatively fast PC and a USB port, which is key.  Bought a 32mb card and a drive, and moved on.  These guys burn through batteries if you don't buy NiMH rechargeables, so I did.  Best choice, definitely.  I bought 8, and have cycled them through the camera since mid-October without hesitation.  Great battery life, enough warning to move to a new set.

Loves?  The monitor is clear and bright, and much like a Nikon viewfinder on a SLR.  Top rate.  Features are easy to learn, and it has plenty.  The on-camera image management is superb.  You can zoom, pan, sort, and really work through what you have taken.  Even the swivel lens is very useful, and you will find yourself using it more and more.  I also bought a telephoto which is a nice optical lens that screws on to the native lens.  Very good for distance (landscape, etc.) pictures.  The pictures are what you would expect for a megapixel camera.  Great, great, great.  I've surprised myself with the low-light utility of this camera.  Night photos of the skyline in Chicago, Christmas lights, etc.  Just get it steady.

Hates?  Don't care much for the optical viewfinder.  Actually just don't use it.  Seems cheap, like a box camera.  Lots of red eye.  Get proficient at Photoshop.  Also didn't care for the included photo software.  Again, get proficient at Photoshop.

I love the camera.  I'd recommend it to about anyone.  The prices are dropping like a stone, and I have seen the camera in the $600s.  Shop on.
