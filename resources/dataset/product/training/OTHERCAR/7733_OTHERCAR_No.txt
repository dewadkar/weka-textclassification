            Well where should I begin. I have had my neon for about four years. And I have had nothing but problems from the beginning. The first problem was I had to have my engine mount replaced. Then came the wet floor, anytime it rained hard, my floor on the passenger side would get soaked. And that was all in the first year. I have also had my passenger window adjusted several times, but no luck it still makes a very loud whistling noise most of the time. Since then my weather strip around the windows have continued to peel off. And now the latest, my paint on the roof of my car has completely peeled off. I was told it has been known to happen to the Neons. So you would think they would cover it, wrong! Now mind you my car only has 28,000 miles on it. And I keep it in excellent condition. But since my yearly warranty was up, they will only pay 75% of it. I even tried to fight with Chrysler about it and that is their final decision.
So I would not recommend to anyone to buy a Chrysler vehicle. And I am not the only one with problems my sister had an Avenger that was junk. And my aunt's Chrysler van is also junk. And getting the extended warranty does get you anywhere, believe me I know I have one. The only thing they are good for is great gas mileage and they drive easy.
If you don't want any headaches, don't buy a automobile from Daimler Chrysler.<br><br>
