            Sony's DSC-S70 digital camera is outstanding and photographs can easily be blown up to 11x14 or larger ..... but Sony support is strangely lacking.

Nowhere is there a complete list of specifications.  For example, what is the lens ring/adaptor size?  My local camera shop cannot fit an adaptor ring to the apparently off-size lens threads.  Sony's VAD S70 adaptor is always &quot;out of stock&quot; so I cannot easily fit the camera to my Celestron C-8 telescope (2000 mm lens) or my slide/negative copier (both, by the way, work fine with the camera using a makeshift paper tube adapter).

Nor can I find out if the standard professional flash I use with my Zeiss-lensed 35mm Contax cameras will work with the DSC-S70 without causing damage(using an appropriate cord, of course).  They need to supply such specifications in the manual or on their web site.

While the built-in red-eye-special flash is adequate (it has a pre-blink red-eye reducing setting, but that just gets rid of the nicely sized, large pupils), an external flash is a must for the professional.  I use two flash-triggered remotes to fire a couple of electronic flashes when I am doing portraiture, and have thus been able to work around the small too-close-to-the-lens flash's red-eye problems while in formal settings.  I have not purchased Sony's external mount HVL-F1000 flash (yet ... and may not if I can find out if my current flash will work ... maybe that's why they DON'T provide the specifications!).

I strongly recommend the write-protectable 64mb memory stick.  The standard 8mb holds only 5 photos at FULL JPG resolution (why else would you purchase a costly 3.3 megapixel camera?).  And you truly need a minimum of a CD-RW drive on your computer if you take prolific photos like I do.

The camera comes with basic photo editing software, but the user will rapidly feel the need to purchase a program like PhotoShop if they are &quot;darkroom oriented&quot; like I am.

I like the way the camera is viewed as a &quot;removable drive&quot; on my Windows 98 machine, but find the MSAC-US1 USB memory stick reader adaptor (also viewed as a removable drive) to be much faster than the standard cord-to-camera USB connection.  The 3 1/2&quot; Memory Stick floppy adaptor MSAC-FD2M might provide easier transportability between computers without taking any special software drivers with you, but it seems diskette-slow.  I also like the camera's ability to take simultaneous &quot;e-mailable&quot; duplicates and make voice annotations.  I have not used the short video capability other than to explore it; for what it is designed for, it appears adequate. 

I can easily recommend this camera to people who already have a computer set-up with an excellent (minimum 1200 dpi) color printer.  The pictures are superb and the small detail is amazing (beter than that of the current 100 ASA films, but not as good as the old 25 ASA Kodachromes)!  And when the cost of film, developing, and reprints, is taken into consideration and weighed against rapid e-mails of, for example, &quot;the new baby&quot; with a photo quality far beyond what the average person sees or expects, the Sony DSC-S70 is cost effective and provides outstanding bang for your buck!
