            This Saturn SW2 has 120k miles on it, has been rear-ended twice, and is still running great!

My wife and I bought this car used about 2.5 years ago with 80,000 miles on it, and were at the time a little hesitant about getting a 5 year loan on a car with so much mileage.  However we have not been let down.

This Saturn has been through the worst of times, and is still going strong.  I work in Baltimore, MD, and during commuting have been rear-ended (HARD) twice.  Even given this, the car is running in great shape!  I'm predicting that this car will have over 200k miles on it before I ever think of getting rid of it.

It is a great car for a couple who needs to carry a lot of stuff around with them (My wife and I go camping &amp; on long trips a lot).  It does however though get a little bit cramped when you get more than 2 people in it.  So as a true 'family' car, it may not be the best choice, as your kids will be RIGHT behind your head without much breathing room.

It would also be nice if it came with a roof rack, however we have learned that you can fit exactly a 10' long pole (piece of pipe/wood/etc) in the car diagonally going from the front passenger foot well, to the back corner.  And 9' items fit just fine straight on without having to interfere with a passenger.

All in all, a great little wagon ...<br><br>
