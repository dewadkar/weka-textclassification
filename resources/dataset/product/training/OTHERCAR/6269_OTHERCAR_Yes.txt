            My mom bought a brand new 98 Accent hatchback, Automatic in Nov 1998.  Its ride is a little bumpy/jerky, probably from short wheelbase and stiff suspension. The seats aren't the most comfy either
The car has developed a few squeaks and rattles over the last few years. The dealer managed to fix only some of them.  In hot weather there is a funny sounding rattle from dash area on drivers side which dealer could not fix. There is a very high pitched whistle from the engine when you accelerate, and the dealer has tried 3 times to fix it but can't. They keep saying it's  commen in some 98 Accents but not all??? It's out of warranty now, so she'll have to live with it I guess. She only averages about 5000 miles per year, and only needs to fill the tank about once a month, which is about the best thing, because she's retired. If your on a budget then buy a used Hyundai, but before you do I would get it checked out thoroughly by a mechanic, and remember you get what you pay for. Although I believe new Hyundai,s now come with a 5yr/100,000 mile warranty. <br><br>
