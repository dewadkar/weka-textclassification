            [NOTE: I have the Japanese version of this camera. The only difference, though, is the name of the camera (FinePix 1200) and the fact that the user manual and software are in Japanese. :-) ]

I got this camera because I wanted an inexpensive decent digital camera. So far it has been pretty-much everything I thought it would be. The pictures are good and sharp (as long as I don't move while the camera is snapping the picture), and the menus are easy to use and logically laid out. The camera fits easily into my hand, and doesn't have any odd protrusions that make it difficult to use.

I really like how long the batteries last. I've used other digital cameras in the past that drain batteries faster than I can buy (or recharge) them. I know color LCD screens use a lot of power, and I'm glad Fuji came up with one that doesn't consume the power quite as quickly. I also like how the display can be turned off to conserve battery power.

The SmartMedia card is a very convenient way to store the pictures. It's small and transfers the data quickly to the computer. I do recommend getting a SmartMedia card reader, though, so you don't have to waste battery power when you transfer pictures to your computer.

There are only three things I really dislike about this camera: the &quot;zoom&quot;, no DC power cord included, and the software that comes with the camera.

First of all, the &quot;zoom&quot; is just a little switch on one end of the camera. It would have been nice for it to be automatic, though I'm sure that would have raised the price. The close-up setting is for really close close-ups (within about 1 inch). If you try to use it any other time the pictures will be blurry. Most of the time, you will use the camera on the landscape zoom setting (or &quot;infinity&quot; focus).

Second, there is no DC power cord included with the camera. So, unless you spend more money to get one, you have to either buy a SmartMedia card reader or waste battery power to download pictures.

Third, the software that comes with the camera is really quite awful. I recommend not installing it and buying your own image-manipulation software (such as Adobe Photoshop). I also recommend buying a SmartMedia card reader (as I mentioned above) as this will handle the transfer of files much better than the included software. You'll also be able to use the card reader with any other device that uses SmartMedia cards (such as MP3 players, for instance).

Overall, this is a great low-end digital camera. It has its drawbacks, but it does the job, and it's easy to use.<br><br>
