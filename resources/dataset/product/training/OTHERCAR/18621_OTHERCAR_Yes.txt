            I bought a '99 Alero last summer (2003) used obviously, with 79k mi. and paid around $7.5k, a hell of a deal if you ask me. I needed a new car, my last one ('86 honda prelude) began to get a bit expensive, and became somewhat unreliable. My grandparents agreed to lend me the money, but I had to buy a car that I thought they would approve of, yet something I liked. 

I liked the bodystyle (GLS, so its got sport and class) and wanted the 3.4 V6 (although i had heard they're a bizoch to work on) especially since id been in a 4 cyl. for the past 2 yrs. and I knew that my grandparents would approve. It was a choice between this and a 98 Malibu, slightly less room, much smaller engine, not something you want if you like power.

The ONLY MAJOR problem Ive had so far is with the passlock, the security light comes on and my car wont even try to start for 10 min (programmed that way), and I dont know why, but Im hoping that the astro-start system will fix that by over-riding the passlock system.

Other little problems: The factory CD/Tape, I hate it, I had an AIWA in my last car, and i could put a pretty scratched cd in there w/o a worry. Now my cd's have to be almost new to prevent skipping. The 6 speaker system is alright, but the tweeters and 4x6's in front distort easily.

Seats: Most comfortable back seats ive ever sat in, and all my friends agree. Ive heard complaints about the windows being too high in back, and the seats too low, but i havent had any complaints yet, and dont mind myself. 

Also, the middle consol is a little far back, making it somewhat uncomfortable to reach into while moving, and the second cup holder is almost useless your on a long trip, the only use ive found for it is for spare change. A button to let down the back seats from the interior would be nice, and some vents to de-fog the side windows, from the bottom of the window (my prelude had them, it speeds up defrosting quite a bit)

The handling is tight, but the car tends to pull a little to the sides when you put it to the floor. I have a feeling that the tire sports package helps with this, my car came with the 16" aluminum alero rims, with 225-50 R16 HR Tires, giving up a little smooth ride for better control.

The alero was actually designed to beat the honda accord and toyota camry. I (being a teen) am forced to like acceleration, and in the 4 months ive owned it Ive noticed its even better than that, taking out civics, pimpd out caviliers (not a big accomplishment), and a 300M (one of chryslers most powerful midsized cars)

The gas mileage is nothing special...i get between 16-19 intown and 25 max on the highway, but ive yet to change the plugs, that might be part of it.

The paint they use is also not the best, ive noticed many alero's with chiped up front ends, and infront of the rear tires. The designer im gonna guess must have been a city guy driving in town only, because the wheel base (although i love it) is a bit too wide for the body, throwing rocks against the car alot, requiring me to put on mudflaps (also stylish if u spend enough). but i dont think the wheel base should be shortened, the body should be about an inch wider on ea. side, or come factory with atleast front mudflaps.

Ive also heard complaints about the "hideously large tail lights"...I like them, it makes the car stand out, and if you look at other cars, these arent THAT big, they just have a different look. i saw a set of civic headlights in the store, not much smaller.

Body packages are also UGLY, especially the RAZZI, and the AED isnt much better.
