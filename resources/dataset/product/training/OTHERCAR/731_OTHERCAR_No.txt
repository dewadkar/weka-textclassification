            OK so I buy the Eclipse.. I thought it was a cute car.  Good value for the price.  I hate this car.  It has this weird clanging noise that only happens when it is cold out.  No one can fix it.  My mechanic has tried, but to no avail.  The transmission went at 33,000 miles.  Replaced the battery at 39,000.  The coolant is constantly leaking.  Each time i take it in, they tighten a clamp, but how many times can you tighten the clamp, and why should it keep coming loose?  The whole car sounds like it is falling apart.  I will never buy a mitsubishi again.<br><br>
