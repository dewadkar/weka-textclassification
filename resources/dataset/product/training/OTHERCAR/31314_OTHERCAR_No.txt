            I bought a 1990 Grand Am about 2 years ago and that was the worst car that I have ever had in my life. After I had the car for 2 days it was already causing problems. Granted that it was a used car I didn't expect it to be perfect but I didn't expect half of the problems that I had with this car.

Well some of the problems that I had with the car were that 2 days after I bought the car the check engine light came on so we took it in and that trip cost $200 dollars, but that was not the end of the problems. It seemed that ever time I would drive through water the car would die we tried to get this problem fixed about 3 times and no one knew what was wrong with it but yet again there were still other problems like not starting, dying the the middle of the road, and many other problems.

I will never buy a Pontiac Grand Am again I just don't think that they are very well made. I now own a 1996 Chevy Cavalier and it is 100% better that the Grand Am. So if you want a reliable car that will run great the Grand Am is not the car that you are looking for.<br><br>
