             I have a 97 Intrepid and man I love it. The Intrepid series seems to have that sporty look to it that many other family cars lack. So even though I may be toting a million people around all day, it still looks and feels like I am driving a semi-sports car. I haven't had one problem with the Intrepid and it hugs the road like nobody's business. The surprising thing to me was, that for my money, I got quite a lot with the deal. Even when it is not &quot;fully loaded&quot; the intrepid has many great features. For those of you who are interested in your sound system sounding decent, that is exactly how the sound in this car sounds. Dodge seems to have taken the effort to make the sound system more than base line. In General , the Intrepid is a great buy for a family looking to travel a lot, a couple , or even a teenager. It's outward appearance is deceiving, on the inside, there is ample space. I hope I have been helpful.<br><br>
