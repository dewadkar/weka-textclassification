            In February, 1997, I took the liberty of taking a left turn in my father's 1989 Jeep Cherokee, and someone else took the liberty of speeding to beat a red light.  The result -- a totaled Jeep Cherokee, a bitter insurance battle, and of course -- my dad having to purchase a new vehicle a year earlier than he wanted to.

After a few test runs, instead of a new Jeep Cherokee at the time, he leased a 1997 Isuzu Rodeo.  In 1999, the lease was up, and I can't blame him for renewing.

The Rodeo is a phenominal SUV.  Phenominal -- a word I use only to describe really good things, like &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and toasted Italian bread.  This vehicle, which I have been able to put a cautious 10,000 miles or so on myself, is great.

My first reactions to this was -- &quot;where are the options?&quot;  The vehicle, at the time, had an MSRP of around $28,000.  In 1993, we purchased a Mercury Villager, with some pretty cool options, for about $21,000.  So I was expecting more than the Rodeo had.

Then after realizing that the Rodeo, at least at the time, was an SUV, not a family vehicle, I came to live with it.  Four-wheel drive (&quot;shift-on-the-fly&quot;), an in-dash CD player, great factory sound system, a &quot;Power&quot; button, an &quot;Ice&quot; button, and trunk window that opened via a push button next to the steering wheel were those luxury options (please notice some sarcasm in that statement).

However, I can't complain about the vehicle's performance.  A little slow when starting from a stop position, the Rodeo is impressive once it gets going.  I don't know the number of ponies it has ... probably 220 or 235 ... but the V6 engine is ample for a truck this size.  It is more of a truck than an SUV, and I like it that way.  It is a quiet ride at moderate speeds (up to 65, then it can get a little noisy), but the power of the engine, that you can hear, is testosterone soothing!  Estrogenic for the women too :-)

The room is excellent.  It seats five very comfortably, six if you put a small person in the middle of the back seat.  The cargo space is great.  The roof-rack is a great place for skis and mattresses.

Snow, ice, and an occasional house are no problem for this vehicle to plow through.  Two levels of four-wheel drive should be plenty.  However, in tough situations, there is this &quot;Ice&quot; button that sort-of works (how much can one really do on ine?), by using the truck's momentum and power at speeds of up to 10 MPH.  It keeps you from scrubbing out or fish-tailing, since the vehicle is rear-wear drive.  The &quot;Power&quot; button is used for towing.

My only complaint is the moon-roof.  Its a great addition, but this model's did not include a cover over the motor -- so when it rains, it doesn't pour -- it short circuits!  Isuzu will cover it so many times per the warranty, but they got tired of us coming in every 6 months!

I recommend this highly.  New SUVs are expensive -- but this four year vehicle runs $12,000 - $18,000.  Did I mention we have 70,000+ miles on the vehicle, and have had NO problems.  A major accident once -- I was rear ended (clearly his fault!) by a truck going 40 MPH while I was going 0 MPH (taking a left-turn).  The seat belts worked great, and although expensive for the other guy's insurance company ($10,850 in damage), I was able to drive it home so my dad's eyes could pop out of his head!  Luckily, no one was hurt.

Rodeo -- again, highly recommended by me!  I don't own it ... I just drove it (from February 1997 until July 2000, when I bought my own 1995 Grand Am -- review here on Epinions.com).<br><br>
