            WOW!! what a car!! This car not only looks like a futuristic personal aircraft, but this baby is ready to fly!! I got my Hyundai Tiburon as a birthday and graduation gift, due to the fact that I was attending college far from home and needed a reliable car. 

Before I ever got a chance to drive a Hyundai Tiburon, Life wasn't that exciting in the driving department. Just a ho-hum drive from here to there. I didn't really want to venture out on the open road and I hated fumbling with the tape cassette player in my old car.

But Life became a bit more adventurous with my introduction to the 2000 Hyundai Tiburon. I LOVE  driving now. This car  handles wonderfully. Its got a great system any c.d sounds great in. The space age interior is very attractive. It also has this great engine sound when it accelerates. 

I've had it for almost a year now and I've had absolutley no problems with it whatsoever. Its a wonderful car. Of course I wouldn't be able to inform you on all that detailed mechanical/technical stuff because I'm an 18 year old girl. (not to mean that all 18 year old girls are car knowlege illiterate) But from pure expierience and observation I can definitly declare this car worth your money and it could even change the way you feel about driving!!<br><br>
