            I absolutely love my 2000 Honda Accord Coupe. For 30 grand, I got a sports car with enough room to fit five people. Also, my V6 engine takes almost any one of my buddies' cars in both acceleration and speed. 

One thing noteworthy, is the fact that almost all of Honda's products are of the highest quality and reliability. i bought this car because I knew this statement was true. My Honda Accord will last my atleast 10 years, and that's one of the reasons I bought it, excluding the fact it's very fast, has great acceleration, and has many safety features I feel are very important on a modern-day car. 

Not only is my Accord Coupe fast, but more importantly, it's safe. I have dual airbags, and a steel roll bar included as just some of the many safety features. I feel extraordinarily safe in my Accord.

The 2000 Honda Accord Coupe also handles very well. Since the Accord Coupe is lower to the ground, and is produced on a wide frame, I can take some serious curves at higher speeds, safely.

Some features on the Accord Coupe are the standard ABS, power steering/windows/locks, and a CD player. The optional features are the leather seats, upgraded wheels/rims, and much more. 

One last thing about the Accord is that I only paid 25 g's for a high-quality car with all the options I wanted. This really made my wallet happy when I saw the sticker price. I expected to pay atleast 35 thousand for a car with as many features as it came with, but Honda is not only a company who puts out high quality products, but also knows how to charge their customers so their wallet isn't hurting the next day at the grocery store. 

Overall, the 2000 Honda Accord coupe is the best car I've owned so far, and I plan to keep it for a while, as well.<br><br>
