            I owned a 1988 Acura for 5 years and all and all the car ran good, I take very good care of my cars and i am always Maintaining and fixing the parts of the car that i know how, so i know alot about this car, there are some really good anf bad things about this car, so i will be honest, the good things first are, It's a powerful car, Excellent steering, Excellenct acceleration, this car will be tons of sports cars, the interior is very comfortible you could easily save money on a hotel on night and sleep in the car, good trunk space, very easy to get to the interior controls, radio, ash try, (No cup holder) glove compartment, etc. Also the engine looks more like a computer, lot's of wires and gadgets, and other thinks, the transmission dip stick is hard to get to, but it is still pretty easy to get around the engine. The car has a thick layer of paint which makes it good for the ocassional chip or scrach.

Now the bad things, often times the air conditer has lot's of problems, smell, does not always work so good, and uses R12 and opposed to R13, which is illegal to buy, you have to pay someone to add refrigerant to it for you.  The timing belt is hard to get to and has a "V" type engine, so if you don't fix the belt and it breaks the engine is destroyed.  Even though the paint is thich on the car, the semi-gloss is not, so the car easily rusts especally around the gas tank, I have so alot of 1996-1990 acuras with rust around the gas tank It's a manufactures defect, that there was no drain zone near the area where you put in gas, the gas often leaks on the quater panel creating rust.  The 1987-1989 Acrua Legend is real a transitional car, because it is luxary it has alot of computer functions wih in the engile which requlate many things, but it's before the newer luxary cars where a single computer can regulate the whole engine with out using tons of wires to every part of the engine, so when you look at the engine you might be over whellemed by all the different color wires here and there.  The car does not handle snow very well even with the ABS braking system, that most likely due to no POSI-traction, One last thing that every 1987-1990 Acura Legend should know the transmission Pin is not very strong, my transmission told me after i brought it in one winter when the transmission broke down, that he see more Hondas and older Acuras with transmission problem than any other car, DO NOT rock the car from foward to reverse if you are stuck in the snow, and if you really need to make sure that you wait atleast 5-10 seconds before changing the changing the shift, this will ensure that you don't heat up the transmission pin and end up paying $2,500 for a rebuilt tranny.
