            The Kodak Digital 240 is extremely easy to use and produces great pictures.  

One of the reasons we bought it was it's ability to take in focus close-ups of the small items that we list for sale on ebay. This camera allows you to do this either by looking through the optical view finder or through the LCD screen on the back.  Then it is a simple matter to connect the camera to your computer and use the included Adobe Photodeluxe software to edit the pictures and then to upload them to the internet. 

Not only is it useful for small objects, but the camera's small size makes it easy to carry in your pocket or purse.  We took ours to the Detroit Thanksgiving Parade and bought back a camera full of very sharp and clear pictures that we both posted on the internet and printed out.<br><br>
