            I bought the Nikon coolpix 950 after reading tons of reviews, weighing the features and price, then pulling the trigger. Now after 3 months of using the camera, I am in a quandary.

THE GOOD: The camera takes excellent high resolution shots, it is easy to use, and I have had fun creating web sites with the photos, etc.

The Bad: I have one major (and one minor) problem with this camera:when using the auto flash indoors with the &quot;eliminate redeye&quot; function ON, the camera produces shots with the worst case of redeye I have ever seen from any camera. The problem shows up worse in children than adults (something about their eyes not responding as fast to the pre-flash).

I've looked at the message posts regarding redeye on the nikontechusa.com Tech Forum, and I must say that I am amazed. The company suggests that the user simply &quot;deal with&quot; the redeye problem by becoming a graphic designer (i.e. using Photoshop to paint in the correct colors) or get the subject to not look directly at the camera (try that one with a 6-month old!).

HEY, this is a $900 camera! I've used everything from disposable cameras to my trusty Minolta Vectis 25 (a wonderful little automatic camera) and have never experienced anything close to the redeye problems presented by the coolpix 950.

The Minolta uses a rapid-fire 3-time flash to eliminate redeye and it works perfectly every time. The notion presented (again) by nikontechusa.com tech support that &quot;candid animal shots&quot; would not be possible is one of the silliest responses I have ever heard (my apologies to animal lovers, but really..).

I now have a 6-month old baby girl and dozens of great photos of her looking like she's starring in Exorcist 3. I have played with changing eye color at the pixel level in several software programs (including the one provided with the camera), and it certainly isn't easy, though it may be my only option to save the past memories. 

I'm not that old, but there was a time not long ago that a company would be roasted alive for a product like this one--especially considering there is no mention of the problem in any product reviews (and I researched digital cameras to death).

My minor problem is that there is really no good way to download images from the camera to your computer without a compactflash card reader (can be purchased separately for about $60 from other vendors). The first FAQ on the nikontechusa.com site mentions the occasional inability for the camera to connect to your computer's serial port, but offers little in the way of help. Nikon's tech support system allows you to call and leave your question for an eventual call-back, but they only called me back once and I left them messages 4 or 5 times.

At this point I would have serious reservations about recommending this camera--unless you want to carry your old instamatic around to take indoor shots.

That's my two cents.
