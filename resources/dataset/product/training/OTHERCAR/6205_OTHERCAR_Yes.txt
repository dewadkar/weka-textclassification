            This review pertains to the XLE 4 cylinder model.

The car has incredible fit and finish.  No plastic mold seams lines, sharp edges, rattles or squeaks.  Everything works with precision as it SHOULD.  Road noise is hushed, giving the feeling of isolation and safety from the world outside.

This car has tons of features you wouldn't expect at this price point: power seats, trip computer, 8 speaker JBL stereo with 6-disc in-dash CD changer, auto climate control, ABS, rear window sunshade, Homelink.  We paid under $20k for our car.

Gas mileage for the 4 cylinder is good.  We average about 27 MPG on regular gas.  Acceleration is good; I don't know why anyone would need the V6.

The ONLY problem with this car is that it isn't fun to drive.  It's not objectionable either; it does what it's supposed to do and not much more.  It gets its driver from Point A to Point B in comfort, relative style, and without trouble.
