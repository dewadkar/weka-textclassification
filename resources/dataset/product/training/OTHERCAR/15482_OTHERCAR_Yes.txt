            I needed a camera to share my experiences in Saudi Arabia with family and friends back home.
I have been using the Sony MVC-FD88 for almost a year now and it has never let me down. Over 300 pictures uploaded to the internet fast and easy. Clear, crisp, the perfect file size for uploading.
I love the fact that I can use floppy disks. Over and over. Never a problem with film or memory sticks. No additional cables or download program to cart around when I travel. I can make copies of disks right on the spot and share my pictures immediately. It performs well in the heat of the desert or the cold winters of Canada.
I hate the fact that my wife always wants to take it when she goes home and I don't have it for my own use. I hate the fact I may have to buy another MVC-FD88 to keep peace in the family. The size sometimes is a drawback, but that's because of the disks used for storage.
Anyone who wants simplicity of use, excellent file storage system, 3 levels of digital sized pictures and video to boot, should buy this excellent product.<br><br>
