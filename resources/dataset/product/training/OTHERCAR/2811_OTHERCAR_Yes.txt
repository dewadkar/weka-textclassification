              The Olympus D-400 Zoom is a great camera to own. I takes very good quality photos with 3 resolution sizes. You can take low resolution pics for e-mailing or website use. The higher resolution option gives you wonderful, very printable photos.
  You can get 4, 8,16 &amp; 32 mb memory cards to take your photos. I would recommend having more than one card, especially if you are on a trip &amp; not near a computer to download images.
  Having the zoom is great. You can really zoom in from quite a distance. Other cameras without a zoom make it difficult to get good shots without being very close. You don't have to worry about that with this camera. 
  Being able to view the pictures on the LCD monitor lets you decide which ones to keep &amp; which to delete. No wasting film to get just the photo. If you don't like what you've taken, just delete it.
   The only really drawback to this camera is the battery use. You sure go through a lot of AA's. They last no time at all, especially if you use the LCD monitor a lot instead of the regular viewfinder. You do have the option to use an AC adapter, but sometimes you're just not in the right place for that to work.
