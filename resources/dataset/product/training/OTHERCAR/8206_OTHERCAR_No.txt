            STRENGTHS:
The car is very close to being a technical master piece. Great acceleration above 5 mph combined with AWD affords performance and safety under a wide variety of conditions and circumstances. Cruising at 60-90 mph is a joy of comfort and quietness. 

WEAKNESSES:
1. Absolutely terrible dealer service: poor quality service and very unpleasant to do business with. In addition, the local Audi Representative has broken/not showed up for five meetings, I have requested, to discuss the problems I am having with this A8. Unfortunately Audi of America defers their decision making to the "invisible" local representative I've yet to meet. 

2. Terrible visibility and LARGE blind spots for the driver. 
A. Exterior mirrors that are tiny and have no business being on a 70K car vehicle. Too many times I have gotten ready to make a lane change and "discovered" another car where I wanted to be. This sucks and really makes turnpike driving less than comfortable.

B. The rear seat head rests obscure approximately 35% the rear window. The head rests do not fold down or recess when they are not in use. This along with the fat C pillars make for some very unsafe blind spots. Neither the dealer or Audi have responded to my requests for help solving the vision problems.

3. Passenger's airbag deployed with no passenger in the car during an accident. Driver's bag did not deploy. Audi claims this is "NORMAL" behavior for the A8. (it is NOT normal) 

4. My A8 spent 7 weeks while the dealer attempted to repair intermittent remote control problems. During this time I asked the dealer's Service Manager to install a license bracket mounted radar proximity detector I had purchased ($350). The service manager called me back and very unpleasantly said: "If I wanted to do aftermarket work I would be working for Circuit City!" Huh??? 

I've been driving for 44 years and this is the worst combination of dealer, manufacture, and quality I have confronted. 





SUMMARY:
For 67K I've had the worst experience during 44 years of driving with Audi's local dealer, Audi of America, and quality issues in many areas both car and the quality of dealer service. My giving the "Value Rating" of three to the A8 based upon what I know the car is easily capable of being. I'd heartily recommend my experiences with Audi and my A8 for YOUR most disliked relative or neighbor.
