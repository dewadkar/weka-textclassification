                 Let's not soft pedal the fact that Chrysler is, first and foremost, an automaker with, well, class.  Driving a Chrysler is a pleasant experience because the automaker's higher price tag delivers ample quality for the cost.  Combine good handling with solid horsepower and a comfortable interior and you've got the formula for an excellent sports convertible.
     The Chrysler Sebring's handling is precise and solid and responds easily and smoothly.  The strut and shock system is very well made, and absorbs the impact from the road.  This is more then I can say for the Ford Mustang, but on the down side I think the Cammaro's interior has a better design.  Engine power is ample but there needs to be more in the base model- a Dodge Intrepid easily blew us away.
     That's really one of the down areas of the sebring.  While there is ample space for the passengers and driver, the console design is needlessly awkward.  There's a forward area near the gear shift that consists on several compartments that aren't very useful in the slightest.  To make matters worse the only console with real storage space rests way too close to the armrest, meaning that a person has to do this awkward pivoting of the arm downward to reach their CD's.  The seats are plush and comfortable, and really cradle the body during travel.
     Exterior styling is very good, with a real fluid feel to the design.  And the automatic top is a nice touch, though the Sebring I drove had the automatic top &quot;hang-up&quot; occasionally.
     Still, if you can afford the Sebring's price tag this is an excellent convertible.  Eventually it might even be competition for the king of this class- the Chevrolet Corvette.<br><br>
