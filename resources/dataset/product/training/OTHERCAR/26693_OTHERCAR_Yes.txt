            If your looking for a great camera with point-and-shoot ease, good picture quality and decent price, this is the choice for you!

*Point-and-shoot
Just like it says, can't get any easier. I was taking pictures right out of the  box, no directions needed. The controls are fairly intuitive, great LCD display for picture preview, very cool panoramic mode(explained below). 

*Picture quality
At 1.3 MP, this isn't for the pro's, but is perfect for sharing on a CDR, email or website. The color is true to life and sharp. Easy to use software/slide show viewer included. Just plug the cord into the camera and to your PC's serial port, and download. The image does get fuzzy when you take pictures in the 2x zoom mode, even using when using a steady surface to set the camera.

*Price
Great price for the features, $230-300 street prices as of this writing.

*Detailed info
&gt;The camera holds 36 pics at HQ, and 122 at SQ with the included 8MB media card. Viewing identical pics at HQ &amp; SQ on a PC monitor I couldn't tell the difference until I zoomed in or enlarged the picture. Fitting 122 pictures on one 8MB card is perfect for a long day or even a weekend trip of picture taking.
&gt;Serial port downloading a little slow compared to USB, but for this price, I can wait the few extra seconds.
&gt;If your into the manual adjustments, this camera has those too(ISO, exposure settings, etc.).
&gt;Attached lens cover slides over the lens.
&gt;Auto flash, red-eye reducer.
&gt;Panoramic mode, push a button and start taking pictures looking at the display, moving the camera one frame at a time, up &amp; down or side to side and the software will &quot;stitch&quot; the pictures together to form a panorama shot.
