            If you saw any of those 1-2 star reviews, I can tell you that either they don't own a mini-cooper or they're just braindead. I've had mine for a few months now and I have nothing negative to say about it. I'll cover what I think matters to most people.

Gas Mileage:  

It really depends on how you ride the car. If you stay up in high RPM's all the time your mileage is going to suck. I drive at an average of 3k RPMs and I get about 25 MPG. (1 tank lasts me about 2 weeks and costs 20$ flat) 

Safety:

I can't say that I've seen any Mini's in a car accident or crash test, but they seem stury and come with front/side airbags.

Operation:

Stick has to be one of the easiest things to learn when using a mini-cooper. I got mine in Las Vegas and had ot learn stick in order to drive home. After instruction on the basic concepts, I hit a church parking-lot and I was on the highway an hour later. 

Comfort:

Very fun to drive in. Comfortable seats, AC, power steering, nice sound system.

Maintenance:

Oil changes every 8,000 miles. (tells you how long until next change each startup) Rest is self-explanatory.
