            What did they do to make a new Chevy full-sized car:
1. Borrowed a 15 year old  engine from the Buick LeSabre; for the cheap version they used a same block engine, only with smaller cylinders.
2. Took the LeSabre/Bonneville chasis and pinched it.
3. Created a roofline which makes the interior claustrophobic for a car which weighs 400 lbs. more than a Camry.
4. Stuck on a fat rear quarter pillar and a small rear-view mirror to minimize visibility; and,
5. Fitted it with the name of a discredited whale of the 80s.

Is it value - possibly
Is it art - only as compared to a Campbell's soup can or the Blessed Virgin covered in excrement
Does it advance the automotive world - not likely<br><br>
