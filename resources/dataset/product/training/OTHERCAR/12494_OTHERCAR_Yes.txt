            Land Rover Discovery Series II, 2002

The Land Rover Discovery came on the market in 1989; it is a very popular vehicle for those who only swear by Range Rover products.

My earlier recollection about the Range Rover all-terrain vehicle was in my days of patrols in the very dense jungle of Darien, which is located partly in Panama and partly in Columbia. The American engineers were trying to complete last leg of the Trans American Highway and we were trying to keep the head hunting tribes in a good mood.

Occasionally we would come across a Rover in the ditch that probably had been part of an earlier expedition. At time we could tell that the Rover had recently and intentionally been abandon, for as soon as we would put some fuel in it, the engine would turn over.  At other times some looked as if they had been left there for centuries, with all kind of jungle plants growing in and around it.

The one I remembered the most is the Rover we came upon just a few hundreds feet after a river. The inflatable pontoons had been deployed, this meant the occupants must have crossed the river, attached to the steering
there was a note saying that they could not go on with the Rover anymore and it gave a direction which the 3 occupants had decided to follow. 

Jungle fever and other tropical diseases will often cause delirium to humans. This was in 1971, the note was dated 1964, what was even more curious is that there was about 1/4
tank of fuel left in it.

Since we were patrolling an area that was secured and without danger, we radioed our discovery to the base. We were told to on and the local authorities would be notified. 

I never heard anything about that Rover afterward, I even had made some contacts in the Panamanian military and they did not know or did not want to say what they had found.

During one of my recent trip to the Philippines, I met a retired Australian soldier. He had trained in the Panama Jungle Warfare School before his government sent him for a tour of duty in Vietnam. 

We never met but we sure had a lot to talk about. He was driving a Land Rover Discovery and we went for a 3 hours ride to Angeles City in it. I must say that his Rover even if it had the British touch, was quite different from the ones I had seen some 30 years ago.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Rover Corporation had to do something to end the bad reputation of the first generation of the Land Rover Discovery. 

It had to contend with unexplainable breakdowns, and a vehicle that was un-stable in windy conditions during Highway driving.

Well they went all the way, 85% of the parts that makes the improved Discovery, are new. Not only that but the Discovery Series II is longer, larger, more powerful and more high tech than its predecessor. 

Although looking at it you can hardly tell that it has been re-engineered completely and to add to the surprise it was done under the German supervision of the folks at BMW.

THE INTERIOR AND THE EXTERIOR

The interior:

I must say that the interior of the series II Land Rover is quite different than the interior of the Rovers we would find abandoned a long side the Darien jungle
trails. 

Theirs were more military like, nothing fancy except for the specialized equipment for exploring un-accessible regions of the globe.

Not that the new Discovery�s interior was luxurious and plush by any means but it was very acceptable for this type of vehicle. Even with the new and improve interior you still can identify the older Rover style, and that�s just fine.

The new Rover door handles for example are still in a vertical position just like the old Rovers. The new improved dashboard with the more modern gauges still has the cold British look of an all-terrain vehicle. As before the gauges and controls are at times hidden from the view of the driver by the oversize steering wheel.

The front seats are very comfortable, more cushionny than the ones in my Explorer, the rear seats are raised and this offers a better view to the occupants in the rear cab, if they can get in there. 

The access to the rear is very difficult for any adult of average size. But I am certain that most children would love to sit there because of the excellent front and lateral view you have.

The exterior:

Aside from being slightly wider and also longer than the earlier Discovery models, the outside appearance has not changed very much. I found the rear doors to the cab to be very small and this adds to the difficulty of passengers
entering the rear seats.

The rear cargo doors is also somewhat of a problem, the way it opens it makes it difficult to load any equipment in the rear cargo area.

The side view mirrors are excellent and do give the driver a good view of the on-coming traffic.

As a whole the new exterior of Land Rover Discovery Series II does look like the earlier model of the Discovery. The needed changes that were made are not very obvious to the naked eyes, but it makes the Series II a safer off-road vehicle.

The Discovery comes equipped with 18 inches tires mounted on alloy wheels. I did like the style of the alloy wheels they seem to fit very well with the Discovery.

THE ROAD TEST

I would have love to have been able to test drive the Land Rover off-road, some may argue that driving on any road in the Philippines is driving off-road, but the highway to Angeles City is actually quite good.

I had heard how much the old Discovery used to sway on the highway because of the wind. We did drive through some very strong wind and I can state that the new Series II is very stable. Again do not expect the full luxury of an American
or Japanese 4-wheel drive, but you will be comfortable.

The Discovery is equipped with a Hill Descent Control System, the system automatically applies the brake on one wheel at the time thus keeping the vehicle under control during steeps descent. This sounds like a different use
for ABS braking system.

To me it seemed that the discovery is a little under-power, it has a V-8 engine developing 188 horsepower but due to the heavy weight of the Land Rover, I think a more powerful motor would have been better.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Land Rover Discovery Series II I drove was equipped this way:

Engine: V-8, 4.0 liters developing 188 horsepower.
Transmission: 4-speed automatic.
Brakes: 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS
Tires: 225/55/HR18 mounted on alloy wheels.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Series II Land Rover Discovery is a much better vehicle than its predecessor is. It is much more dependable to drive, more comfortable and offers the owners an up to date technology in its equipment. 

However it is still not quite the ideal vehicle, being that it is under powered for its weight and will consume much too much gasoline.
