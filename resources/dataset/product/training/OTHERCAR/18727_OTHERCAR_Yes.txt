            First, I should tell you that I didn't even want this Jeep before I bought it. I test drove one and I liked it, but I thought I was too tall and it was too expensive.  My wife and I spent a couple of weeks talking about it and finally we decided to get it.  It's a lot of money, but we figure that okay because we're going to drive it for a long time.

It turns out that I'm not too tall.  I'm probably about as tall as a driver of this vehicle could be (6'4) but if I position the seat right I'm fine.  Luckily, I only had to do this once because it remembers where I like the seat.  When I unlock it with my keys it puts the seat, mirrors, and even the radio where I like it before I even open the door!  The leather seats are also heated and have lumbar support.  That's great on long trips.  Trust me, I put 3500 miles on it in the first two weeks!

After driving it a few thousand miles I have to say I was wrong to think this wasn't the car for me.  It's just amazing how well thought out everything is.  For example, it's a little annoying that the 10 disc CD changer is all the way in the back (whine, whine) because you have to pull over to change them, however it's not really a problem because you can put a single CD in up front.  

Then there's the air conditioning. It's the most intelligent A/C I've ever seen. First of all it's dual zone, meaning my wife can set her side of the car to 70 and I can leave my side set at 60, if we want.  It has an infrared sensor in the center of the dash that scans our body temperature to determine what it need to do.  It also automatically decides what the most efficient way to heat or cool the interior is and does that way (i.e. if it's hot, the best way to cool it might be from the bottom up, so it will start blowing cold air on the floorboards.)  It's completely automatic, so all you have to do is set the temperature you want.  Another example of a well thought out feature: if you get in the car on a really cold morning it won't blow cold air on you.  It will only blow a small amount of air on the window to defrost it.

If a car comes up from behind you with it's high beams on, don't panic, the mirrors will automatically &quot;smoke out,&quot; meaning they darken like tinted glass.

Here's something I have to recommend - the factory tow package.  If you ever think you might tow something, get it.  It's a lot better than getting it installed later because it's actually part of the frame, not just a part that gets bolted to it.  Also, if you get the factory tow package the car will have an additional radiator to keep the engine cool when it's under a heavy load.  This a great feature even if you're not going to tow anything if you live in a place like I do where it get to be a 105 degrees.

This is a truly great SUV.  I've had cars that wished handled this good, or had as much power.  If you're considering a Jeep, or any SUV, go test drive a Limited.  Once you do, there's no turning back!
