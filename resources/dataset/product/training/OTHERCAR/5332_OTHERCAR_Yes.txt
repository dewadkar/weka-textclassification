            I've had this car for about nine months with over 10,000 miles on it.

<b>PROS:</b> Handles well under most bad weather conditions: snow, sleet and driving rain (and I'm driving normally, not like a crazy person).  The gas mileage is mediocre compared to an economy car and you have to use 89 grade gas, per the owner's manual.

According to the dealer, it has this "yaw control" to compensate for extreme turns.  I can't say that I've used it.

The GPS system is wonderful because it saved me from getting lost and helped me get to places I'm not familiar with.

It has dual temperature controls (no more fighting about it anymore) and individual front seat heaters (warms up fairly quickly).

It comes with CD/cassette/radio.  You can install a DVD player if you request the upgrade with the dealership.

It has auto-on windshield wipers and the speed will go slow or fast depending upon the severity of rain (pretty cool).  It also had auto-on headlights.  It also has an extra lumbar seat adjustment in the driver seat (also cool).

The car looks cool.


<b>CONS:</b> My biggest complaint is the configuration of the radio and the buttons for the AC/fan, front/rear defrosters, seat heaters, temperature control, etc., are strange.  It's hard to adjust these items while driving because the buttons are all placed in awkward places since the GPS takes a lot of space.  I always end up accidently pressing the seat heater when I'm adjusting the temperature or changing the radio station.  I liked the way the 2000 ES300 was laid out.  Also, the temperature buttons are "sticky".  I thought it would loosen up over time, but I had to take it to the dealership to make it less "sticky".  Part of the problem is that the top and bottom of the button are flush with the panel and it bulges/domes in the middle, so when you push it, you end up pushing the bulge.

The wood paneling is starting to "unglue" around a corner on the passenger side of the car (it's only 9 months old!)

As the previous reviewer has said, there is a slight snag with the transmission: when you accelerate, sometimes it stalls and it feels like there's something wrong with the fuel pump.  I recently received a letter from Lexus stating that there is a software upgrade for the transmission for all ES300s that are still under warranty.  I didn't upgrade it yet so I can't tell you if it solved the problem.  The letter also said that once you upgrade the software, they are unable to change it to the original software (something to think about).

Originally, the passenger seat heater did not work and I had to take it in to have it fixed.

The "beep" when you lock/unlock the door is so soft, you have to be right next to the car to hear it (forget hearing anything on a busy street in the city) or look at the car to see the lights blink the correct number of times.  I'm annoyed that I have to really pay attention every time I get into and out of the car.

<b>CONCLUSION:</b> It's sexier than the 2000 ES300 and the GPS has been invaluable to me.  I've gotten used the weird configuration because I like the GPS so much.  Out of all the Lexuses I've had (1997 & 2000 ES300) this is my favorite.  Also, I have not experienced mechanical problems with this car (a plus) but then again, I generally don't until it goes off warranty (the 2000 model developed problems the moment it was off warranty, as if it knew when to break).  The 2003 model improved the headlights significantly (they were pretty bad in the 1997 and 2000 models) and the interior driver panel light (so you can see the MPH, gas, etc.)  The 1997 and 2000 models were so bright when you drove at night, it was virtually blinding.
