            About 3 months ago, I found myself unexpectedly in the car market when my 1987 Mazda RX-7 just decided to give up on me!  Since I had recently graduated from college and hadn't even been working a full year yet, I thought I was in serious trouble.  I believed that the only thing I could afford would be a car that was several years old - and you never know what to expect there!

But - to my surprise and delight, a friend recommended that I take a look at the new Daewoo's.  My first reaction was - Korean = Bad, but when I got to the dealership, I was quickly convinced otherwise.  It didn't take long for me to realize that the quality of the Daewoo was very high, but the price wasn't.  I am now the proud owner of my first brand new car.  It was inexpensive, reliable, &amp; many features came standard - and I can't believe that it's actually cute too! <br><br>
