            The Hyundai Elantra is a excellent car for the price.  For the price range, you get so much more equipment then you get in other cars in this range.  Then the 100,000 mile warranty makes it a good deal too.  Now What?   Well you have the comfort of the seats.  I could live in this car it is so comfortable.  Unlike our Ford truck, this beats the truck hands down.  I love the AM/FM stereo cassette.  Great Sound.  Location of speakers is also a plus.  Color of paint comes in a variety of colors.  We like the black one ourselves.   Plain but very nice!  If you were to have to make a decision between this and a Toyota, Choose the Hyundai Elantra.<br><br>
