            This car was owned by my brother, but I drove it quite a bit.  When he wasn't using it, I usually was.  I enjoyed driving this vehicle.  

The 3.1L V6 engine in this car is quick.  The transmission did not present any problems.  All controls were easy to reach.  The gauges on the dashboard are enclosed in four circular pods.  They are very easy to read.  It gave the car a unique look.  To me, it looked like something out of a racing car.  The seats are very comfortable.  If you have friends, there is plenty of room in back.  

I found nothing wrong with the car's exterior appearance.  It is good that this car was designed to look like no other car.  As i said earlier, this car was enjoyable to drive.  It handles quite nicely.  You shouldn't have any problem passing slower moving cars on the freeway.  Stopping power is adequate, especially since the car had ABS.  Basically, this car is for someone who wants a nice car without paying a lot of money, since the Achieva has been out of production for some time.  In spite of that, this car is highly recommendable.  

It is unfortunate that the Achieva's maker, Oldsmobile, is being phased out over the next couple of years.  Oldsmobile makes fine cars and it is good to own what will soon be a piece of history.  <br><br>
