            I have driven the Honda CR-V for two years.  This car is a dream to own.  It is nice looking.  It is clearly not a gas-guzzler like many other truck style vehicles.  There is nothing truck like about the Honda CR-V.

  It rides very much like the Honda Accord and nearly gets the same miles per gallon.  But best of all, it is the first car in twenty five years that has been able to get up my very steep driveway in the snow.  I have a lengthy commute to work and without fail I will pass many a stranded vehicle in bad weather.

  It is an easy car to handle.  There are unblocked views through all the windows.  The outside mirrors cover on-coming traffic and there are no blind spots.  In two years, all I have had to do to this car is get oil changes.

  It can seat five people easily and it is a great car to take on a picnic with the removable picnic table.  I have recommended this car to many and now my son in California owns one and is thrilled with the advice I gave him.   <br><br>
