            I absolutely LOVE my Black 2-door 1997 Honda Civic EX coupe. It's automatic and I have a CD player. It's small enough for me to park and handles easily. It's cute and stylish, and best yet, it was totally affordable! :) I bought my car used, with 37,000 miles on it for $12,000. The trunk is decently roomy and I can fit all of my school and sports stuff in there without any problems. I really like the 40-60 spilt option on the back seats. (You have the choice of folding down 40%, 60%, or all of the back seat to extend the trunk.) I thought that option was cool. I like the cruise control. (My old car didn't have that.) I've had the car a little over a year and I've never had to have it serviced, which is awesome since I'm a poor college student! I've never really had to sit in the backseat, but I think that it can be kinda cramped if you're tall. My car fits 5, but really I think that 4 would travel comfortably. The front seats adjust really well and they're comfortable. (This is a good thing because I'm short!) The car has really good visibility, and the mirrors, door locks, and window are all power. It's a really easy car to drive. It handles well, and the gas and brake pedals are sensitive, so you don't have to step really hard on them. I drive a lot and I think that this car gets pretty good gas mileage. I get around 24-26 miles per gallon, and it has a 10 gallon tank. The lights are manual and if you leave them on and open the door it rings, which is a really good thing because I always forget to turn off the lights. The moonroof is power. The door locks car be kind of irritating at times. You only have a control for them on the driver's side and you have to lock the driver's side door from the outside. (I had an alarm installed to solve that problem.) The biggest thing that irritates me when I drive my car is the lack of horsepower. It's a measely 125 hp. (If you want horsepower I suggest the new Civic Si...it has 160) Maybe if I'd gotten a stick shift it wouldn't seem as bad. However, I feel that the lack of horsepower is a small price to pay for such a good car. The engine is quiet and the ride is smooth. For my purposes the car serves it's purpose. It gets me from school to work or home without a hitch and it was affordable. It doesn't need a lot of servicing and it gets decent gas mileage. (Which is especially nice if you're a starving college student like me.) I think it's a cute, sporty car too. (Although if you get a black one beware! I have to wash my car frequently, it gets dirty so fast!) I definately feel that this is the type of car that would be good for students, high school or college. It's reliable, gets good gas mileage, and it's decently affordable. (You can choose different models to suit your needs: CX, DX, LX, HX, EX)It's a decent compact, economy car. If you're looking for luxury I don't think that this car is for you. Honda's also have really good resale value, but I have no intentions of ever selling my beloved car! :)<br><br>
