            I have currently leased a Land Rover Discovery and will be driving it for the next three years.  I was initially impressed by the style, looks, and reputation of the company and the durability of the products.  After six months of driving the vehicle, my only complaint would be gas consumption.  This SUV is a definite gas guzzler!!  I travel 60 miles total a day to and from work and find that I am spending around $80 - $100 a week in gas!  

As for the big size, it maneuvers well and fits into my small city parking spot like a charm.  I feel very safe in the vehicle because it is so high.  

Overall, a great SUV, but one warning...If you are on a tight budget..you will not be able to afford the gas.<br><br>
