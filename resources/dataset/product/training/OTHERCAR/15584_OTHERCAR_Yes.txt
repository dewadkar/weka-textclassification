                The Acura Integra 4 door automatic is an excellent car for a variety of people.  It has a very sporty look, with a touch of luxury to increase its appeal.  Inside this Integra, there is supple room for at least 4 people, and with 5 passengers, the ride can be a bit snug but still bearable.  What makes this car so great is its balance between sport and luxury.  It has the seats are slightly bucket like, as in a sports car, but the interior is more comfortable as seen in luxury cars.  The handling is excellent for a car in its class, with some considerable acceleration, even in the automatic.  But the most important aspect of the Integra is its outstanding reliablity.  Although my Integra is only a 1997 model, it has not had any problems at all to date.  But many owners I have talked to have never had any serious problems, and have well over a 100,000 miles on their Integras.  I highly recommend this car to those who may have families, but like the feel of a sports car.  The Integra gives these drivers the best of both worlds.    <br><br>
