            This is one of the fastest production sedans on the road today.  The enormous power of this car will blow you away.  This car is not for the faint of heart, you really got to know how to handle a car like this.  
The interior is amazingly luxurious and comfortable.  This is expected out of BMWs but could you have guessed that the fastest production vehicle BMW produces is this comfy.  
The engine revs like a dream and the suspension will keep you glued to the road.  I was especially surprised how well a car this size stuck through the corners, as well as how smooth gears were when down shifting.
Lets not also forget about the hefty buck you'll be dishing out to get one of these dream cars.  I personally don't own one, I tried it at a BMW premier openning where they let previous customers try out new products.
So if you're suffering through a mid-life crisis this car should remedy your problems right away.  <br><br>
