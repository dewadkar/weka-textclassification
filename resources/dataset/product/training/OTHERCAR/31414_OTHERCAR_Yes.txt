            I bought an Alero in Dec. 1999 because I was looking for a midsized car that was both economical and sporty.  I found everything that I looked for and more in this car.  I own the four door Sedan in black that is fully loaded including a sunroof, spoiler, leather seats, etc.  Every where I go I continually get compliments on how sharp my car is.  Not only that but it drives great too.  At the persuasion of my husband I got the V6 engine and boy am I glad that I did.  This car has pick up and lots of it!!  I think the Alero would be a great ride for just about anyone.<br><br>
