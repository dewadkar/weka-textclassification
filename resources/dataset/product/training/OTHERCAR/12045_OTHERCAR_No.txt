            If Honda could find a way to get the engine's torque to come at a lower RPM this car would be awesome. As is it is fast, cool, and fun, but if you ever have to drive this car in real word traffic, you will want to shoot yourself in the foot for buying it.  Even in first gear the lack of torque makes this car hard to acelerate at a normal pace.  When you lauch the car off the line with intent of racing the car flies, but this is a car that needs to be run at wide open throtte to be enjoyed, and no matter where you live that is hard to do.  With 240h.p. coming from its 2.0L inline 4, it does have tope end power, lots of it! In fact this car will rev all the way up to 9000RPM!!! If you do take it up that high you will her nothng other than the engine screaming. Which many people like to hear. The brakes on the car are good too. If you stab them hard they bring the car to a hault in a hurry! The steering and handling feel like a go-kart, and that is a good thing. You can just toss and turn this car all over the place, and all it want to do is go faster.  Over all, I ended up not buying the car becuase I live in the city of Chicago where there is 24 hour traffic, and the dealer mark-up price was an extra $8,000 on top of the $32,000 sticker price. It was just not worth $40,000 for a 4 cylinder car that I can't drive alot here in Chicago
