                 Though I personally drive a pick-up on a daily basis, a Toyota pick-up, I am also a big fan of sports cars.  On the weekends I like to drive my 65 Mustang around.  So when Toyota released the new and improved version of the Celica I couldn't pass up the opportunity to see what it was all about.  I headed down to the dealership and test drove a new Celica GT-S with a 4 speed automatic.
     This new Celica really performs very well in the GT-S version.  The 180bhp motor delivers great acceleration and impressive gas mileage.  On a road unhindered by traffic I managed a very impressive 90 mph through some long and gentle turns.  Handling in this car is outstanding.  At 6000 rpm the motor hits its powerband and gives and extra oomph.  Don't delight in it for too long though, that red band comes up quickly.
     Inside the Toyota folks have designed a fairly well rounded interior and comfortable seats.  As a truck driver, I like to be up off the road where I can see everything thats going on.  In this car I found myself sitting practically on the pavement but I didn't seem to mind.  The stereo is well done, especially for Toyota who is not known for their good stereo products.  The back seat is really just there to catch extra stuff and not big enough to comfortably seat a full grown adult.  But that is what I would expect from this kind of car.  You don't buy this expecting to haul people around.  You just want to haul.
     As with all Toyota products my biggest complaint is price.  At $23,000 and above for the GTS I can get a V8 Pontiac Firebird or Camaro Z28.  While these may not outhandle the nimble Celica, they will surely outrun it.  In addition they also offer more interior room and the stereo systems (a must in a sports car) tend to sound better.
