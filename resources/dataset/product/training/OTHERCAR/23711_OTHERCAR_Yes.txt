            I was looking for an affordable vehicle for someone on a tight budget with payments I knew I could handle, so I test drove the Kia Rio as my first choice. I could not STAND it as I felt like I was back in my 92 Geo Metro. So I was a little hesitant to bother testing another Kia but after a little prodding I got behind the drivers seat and  was I impressed. I knew I wanted it right away. 

There was enough leg room for my 6'2" husband to stretch his legs out in the passenger seat. After driving my friends Corolla around and being annoyed by the cup holders right below the stereo, (What is THAT about anyway? Someone doesnt want me to drink and change CD's at the same time?) it was a nice change to see that they were placed between the seats in the middle console where I wanted them. 

The trunk is pretty spacious and the rear seats fold down for longer or misshaped loads.

The ride was pretty smooth. After driving a Geo around for more then 90% of my driving years, it was refreshing to have a little bit of "get up and go" getting on the highway. Not bad for a 4 cylinder.

The Spectra I ended up with came with automatic transmission, 6 CD changer, cruise control, the wiper package, floor mats, alloy wheels (none of which are standard) I've had it for about 6 months now and I'm pretty happy with it all in all. I'm just a little disappointed that it doesn't have power locks and remote entry =(
