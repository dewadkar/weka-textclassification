            The 1998 Honda CRV was my first venture into the brave new world of SUVs without the gas-guzzling, parking-space hoarding, enviromentalist-annoying V8 tankers.
I bought a used CRV with 50,000 miles for a little over $7000 which was a deal compared to what dealers were asking and the final going price on several ebay auctions.
I must admit I have been totally happy with the vehicle. The spacious interior is roomy enough for even the tallest of us, the instruments are easy to read and within reach and legroom is sufficient even at the back. It handles almost as well as my 2000 Maxima; let me hasten to add that I only dare compare the road hugging and turning ability of the Maxima and not the raw power, takeoff and quiet ride. Still, my 5 speed CRV does drive very comfortably and gives about 25miles/gallon city.
My alternative was the Toyota RAV4 which was priced beyond my reach. In retrospect, I'm glad I got the CRV which not only drives better and feels more stable, but it also looks classy and holds its own next to the boss's Toyota Sequoia V8.
No regrets here- so if you're thinking about it- go for it!
