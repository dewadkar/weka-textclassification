            The <b>Toyota Highlander</b> can be considered as a cheaper alternative to the <b>Lexus RX300</b> � both of them use the Camry�s platform, share 220 hp 3.0 liter V6 engine (2.4 liter 155 hp inline-4 is standard on Highlander), auto transmission, gas tank, drivetrain components.

<b>Engine</b>

Highlander comes standard with 4-cylinder engine (with variable valve timing), front-wheel drive. I would not recommend getting the four-cylinder � there is no manual transmission available and the car is quite heavy (at least 3,500 lb). The acceleration is slow and the car struggles going uphill.

The V6 is a different story � it is smooth and provides good acceleration (in the SUV world), which also beats some cars (4-cylinder Camry for one). The transmission in either case will be a 4-speed automatic. <i>You also get a radio/CD/cassette, A/C, power windows and locks and antilock brakes.</i>

<b>Interior</b>

The interior is nice for the price. It has the same �weirdly located� transmission shifter � it is located in the extension of the front panel, same as in Lexus RX300. The fit and finish is excellent, however the faux wood in the top-of-the-line model looks, you guessed it, fake. But what can one expect for such a low (for Toyota) price?

The four-wheel drive equipped cars have no switches of any kind � everything is automatic and not designed for serious off-roading. The instruments are legible and well illuminated at night. The A/C is very effective.

The V6 engine is smooth and quiet; the shifts are very smooth; there are no rattles in the cabin. The seats are supportive, there is more cargo space than in either RX300 or Jeep Grand Cherokee, the front seats fully recline for increased cargo capacity.

<b>Styling</b>

<b>What I didn�t like:</b> the styling is too �rugged�, the car looks bigger than it is and you can see no resemblance to the RX300 from the outside.

<b>Warranty</b>

You get 3 yr/36,000 mile warranty, 5 yr/60,000 mile powertrain warranty, but no roadside assistance (unlike competitors like Ford, Mitsubishi or GM, who provide roadside assistance). 

<b>Transmission</b>

The car has a 4-speed auto transmission, which is adequate, but some competitors (new Ford Explorer for one) feature 5-speed automatics that improve fuel economy and acceleration.

The ride is nice, although somewhat stiff. The Highlander looks bigger than RX300 and has more space, especially for cargo. 

Unfortunately, it does not have an upscale look that RX300 has, but it is cheaper and still rides nice, has good expected reliability (it is Toyota and the major components are taken from the cars that were in production for a while). The fuel economy is also respectful � around 20 MPG.

<b>Bottom Line</b>

<i>The Highlander is a good alternative to Lexus RX300, it is less expensive and has more cargo space.</i>
