            I bought this product because of the Honda reputation and gas mileage. I have been very disappointed with the purchase.  The gas mileage is great; however here are the negatives: 1. You can only put on a class one trailer hitch. This means if you planned on putting a hitch mounted bike rack on the vehicle it can only handle a two bike load. I never intended it to haul a boat, but can't support four  bikes??? 2. The whining noise the engine/transmission makes above 50mph or going up a hill is unbearable. 3. When you are in cruise control, the whining even gets worse because it won't appropriately shift down. 4. I hoped to eventually use this as a business vehicle(lots of mileage) but the electrical cannot handle a power inverter(my dodge neon does fine with it). 5. The seats are horrible. 6. You have four cup holders available at the front and not one of them holds anything well.

Sorry, this vehicle doesn't even fit in the SUV class. Will get rid of it next year.<br><br>
