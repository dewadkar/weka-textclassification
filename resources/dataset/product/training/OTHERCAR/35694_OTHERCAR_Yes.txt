            When it comes to mid-priced luxury cars, the Pontiac Bonneville ranks towards the top. Well appointed, spacious and a good drive,the Bonne gives me all that I want in a car and more. Controls are generally at hand, the trunk will handle 2 sets of golf club + and the multi-position power seats allow me to &quot;fit&quot; my chassis. Fuel injected power could get a little boost but the engine turns enough power for the average driver. Steering get above average marks for cornering and handling. Upgraded Bose sound/CD system has great sound, clarity and definition. I would like a programmable equalizer added to new units.

I was looking for a larger, sport-styled auto. Not a car which is a step away from a herse. The Bonne has luxury, the size to seat 5 good sized people confortably and still feels like a car that you &quot;drive&quot; instead of just steering about. Don't buy this car if you want the cushion type ride of an Olds or Cadilac. Without going into the $40,000+ range, I got everything one would fine in Lexus or Mercedes.

High overall marks, reliability and ease of maintenance, above average and a great value.<br><br>
