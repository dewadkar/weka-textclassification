            I'll give the camaro one thing, it's fast, very fast.  Unfortunately it handles like a pig, performs horribly in bad weather, possess terrible styling and a ridiculously unrefined interior.
When I graduated college I wanted a fast car.  So I went down to my local chevy dealer and test drove a Camaro Z28.  Wow, was it fast.  Unfortunately I could barely fit in the car (I'm 6'2&quot;).  The controls looked like parts from my old GI Joe toys.  The driving position was terrible and limited my visibility quite a bit.  The car had terrible handling.  I felt like I was driving a sled.  But, I must admit it was very fast.
Unfortunately I would be embarrassed to be seen driving one.  Well, unless I lived in a trailer and wore gold chains with my shirt open.  That is the market that this car seems to appeal to.
Basically if you want a really, really fast car and don't care about anything else buy the camaro.  But for those of you who don't watch NASCAR religiously and can't wear jeans to work I would recommend something more refined.<br><br>
