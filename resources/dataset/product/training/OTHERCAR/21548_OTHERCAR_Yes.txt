            There are cameras with more features, better image quality, better zooming, and lower prices, but I would still take a small cut on the features to have a camera with the S200's size.

Buy this camera and you will take more pictures.  It's as simple as that.  With shirt pocket portability and impressive JPEG compression that allows nearly 200 1200 X 1600 photos on a 128 Meg flash card, the S200 provides utility and freedom that few other digital cameras can match.  

The autofocus is good for 95% of the shots, but in cases of difficult lighting or "no-flash" situations, the manual settings allow for pictures to be taken in virtually any scenario.  Take the time to learn how to use the white balance, exposure, and flash settings, and the S200 won't let you down.

Battery life is quite good, but I would recommend picking up an extra battery if you're the type of person who likes to use the LCD display a lot.  (It only takes about 2 hours of constant display usage to deplete the battery).  If you strictly take pictures with your camera, the battery is good for a hundred or more photos.  Buying a compact flash card reader is also an excellent investment as this too will stretch battery life.  If you have 2 batteries and a flash reader, you won't need to buy the a/c power adapter kit.  (The adapter kit costs about as much money as an after-market battery and flash reader combined!).

Canon provides a lot of useful software with the camera, (including a utility to stitch panorama shots together out of multiple images).  Sadly, they don't seem to offer a no-frills file system interface via USB that requires, little, or no software driver installation.  Yet another reason to buy a flash card reader, as many of them don't require drivers to connect to Windows 2000, XP, or ME systems.  (This is important if you're visiting friends and want to copy pictures to their computer).

In my mind the only debate is whether to spend the extra money on the ever-so-slightly larger and better S330.  

Is $100 worth 3x zoom and a few extra features?   I don't think so, but if money's no object, it's worth checking out.
