            This camera was purchased at Costco for a whopping $499.00! in Jan of 04. I already own a A70 Canon(3.2MP) and am quite happy with it. I was expecting good things from this F 200.

The camera comes with a 16M SD card which is a joke. You can take 1 picture at the highest setting with this and very few even at the next setting down, so why they would do this is just stupid. Your going to need a MINIMUM of 256 for this to be usable. I would recommend 512 IF your going to keep this camera or decide to buy it.

The battery life is the worst out of any camera I've ever owned. You can expect MAX of 50 shots with the LCD ON and just slightly better (around 80-90) with it off. Zoom features are SLOW and the auto-focus seems to be using "the force". I have no idea what it's focusing on, but it's sure not what I'm aiming at. The camera tends to heat up quite a bit also.. Unknown why, maybe it's the fact it's killing these NiMH cells in such record time!

The LCD is good, although the camera it self lacks alot of features found on other less pricey cameras.

I would NOT in any way recommend this camera for anyone. Buying this and using it would leave a pretty bad taste in your mouth if this is a first time purchase. If your looking for something around 3.2 to 4.0, have a look at the CANON A70 or A80 models.
