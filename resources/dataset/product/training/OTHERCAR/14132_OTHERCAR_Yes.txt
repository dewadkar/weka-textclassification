            <B>I received the <I>Fuji Finepix 1300 Digital Camera</I> for Christmas.  This is the first digital camera I have owned so I have nothing to compare it too, but let me say this is a great camera for first time users and the money.</B>

The <B>Fugi Finepix 1300</B> has a lot of great features and fantastic quality pictures.  

Some <I>features</I> of the camera include:

<B>1280 x 960 pixel setting or 640 x 480 pixel setting</B>

<B>SmartMedia 8MB</B> which with the 1280 x 960 setting will hold 12 pictures under fine, 24 pictures under normal and 47 pictures under the basic setting.  With the 640 x 480 setting the smartmedia will hold 89 pictures.

<B>4 AA Batteries</B> are needed to run the camera.  I highly recommend using rechargeables especially with the LCD display the batteries die rather quickly.

<B>Self timer</B>

<B>Digital USB socket</B> makes downloading pictures as simple as plugging the USB cord into the socket located on the side of the camera.

<B>1.5 inch color LCD Display</B> the display is on the dark side and can be hard to see within a darker setting.

<B>Mode Dial</B> for set up mode, photography mode and playback mode.

<B>Date and time stamp</B>

<B>Playback mode</B> will let you view your pictures immediately after taking them.  You also have the ability to to multi-frame playback which will display 9 pictures at a time on the display.  There is also a feature to erase single frames from the camera which is great to get rid of those horrible shots and have enough memory to get more shots.

<B>Built in flash</B> which gives many great features.  It can be set to <I>auto flash</I> for ordinary photography, <I>red-eye reduction</I> to ensure eye colors appear normal, <I>forced flash</I> for backlit scenes such as against a window or in the shade of a tree, <I>suppressed flash</I> where the flash never fires for taking photos indoors at distances to great for the flash to have an effect, and <I>slow synchro</I> which allows you to take great pictures that show your subject and also capture the background (night photos).

<B>Continuous Shooting</B>

<B>Self Timer Photography</B>

<B>2x Digital Zoom</B> can only be used in the 640 x 480 mode.


I have used my camera quite a bit and have been amazed at the quality of the pictures printing off of my computer.  I have also sent them over the internet to be professionally developed with the same quality as using my regular everyday camera.

The only problems I have with this camera is that there is no lens cover for protection, so be sure to purchase a case and the LCD Monitor is located directly beneath the view finder window so you tend to leave nose prints on the display.  Other than that I have had no problems and would recommend this camera to all!!!
