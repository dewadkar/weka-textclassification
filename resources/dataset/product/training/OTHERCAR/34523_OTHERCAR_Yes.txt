            I just purchased a 2000 Chevy Venture last month.  So far the ride has been wonderful.  I have experienced a few problems that were taking care of in my first month (radiator leak and timing problem -- vehicle rolls backwards).  I was driving a 98 Windstar before the Venture and found that the Venture has lots more leg space and room.  The Venture we purchased actually can seat 8 and all the seats can move (except the one with the built in car seat).  We have the automatic sliding door which took awhile to get use to but know love it.  I have 4 small children so this is a plus.  

One of the biggest problems I have with the Venture is installing the Car Seats.  I had no problem with the Windstar and the car seats are the same.  But with the Venture, the car seat is very unsafe in every single location that I've tried.  I cannot get the seat to fit securely.  I've read both manuals (the cars and the car seat) and can't get a secure fit.  Right now, I'm using the built in car seat but my son hates it and wants to ride in his booster.  Anyone have this problem with car seats?<br><br>
