            I guess the true measure of how much someone likes their car is if they buy another one. This is my second Saturn...my daughter drives my 1995 SL2. I haven't had an ounce of trouble with either vehicle. When I shopped for 1999 SL2 last year, I first looked at used models. I saw how those cars, 2 or 3 years old, were only a few grand less than new ones. Saturns seem to hold their value quite well! I was very pleased with the dealership (sales, service, and finance departments). I have bought several new cars before, but none have been easier to purchase than my Saturns. When I told the salesman that this was my second Saturn and I didn't really want the cheering and hoopla, he obliged and just took our picture for the calendar that they give to all purchasers. I feel the extra $1000 for the SC2 (rather than the SC) was really worth it. Peppier engine, larger wheels and better seats sold me. In a few years, when I'm ready for another new car, Saturn will be my first pick.<br><br>
