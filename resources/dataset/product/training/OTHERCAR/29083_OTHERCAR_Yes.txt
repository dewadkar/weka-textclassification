            I live in NYC... not exactly a place to go off roading.  But, this car is great anyway.  It's quiet, feels like car, and the air suspension is great.  The truck manuvers well, and for the money it should.  

The interior is top notch, and the beautiful two-tone seats are really eye-catching and set the car off. 

Controls are fairly simple to learn, even though things are a little different than from what us Americans are used to, it is after all a British Car.

The HK stereo sounds real nice, therfore it isn't necessary to upgrade it.  

Cargo Space is Very Good... and the car is very practical.

Another good thing about this car is that the cost to insure in NYC is relatively low compared to other SUVs in NYC, even though I have new teenage driver in the family, it is still less expensive than other SUVs.
