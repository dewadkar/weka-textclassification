            We actually had a Tracker for a rental in Maui a couple of years ago (it was brand new, and we put over 800 miles on it in the week!), and this last summer, when my husband was looking for a new car for himself, he decided to get a Tracker.  He went with the convertible, which is lots of fun.  Neither of us saw any point in getting the hard top one.  I am currently driving this vehicle because he needed a car for business and since he's had 2 new cars in the time I have had my '92 Toyota truck, I thought it was time for him to drive the truck!  I really like the height, I can see over cars, and through most pickups which is really important for me since I am 5'2&quot;!  This car is definitely good for people who are out just to have fun in their car, and not looking at their SUV as a status symbol.  Also, go with the 2.0 L instead of the 1.6.  We test drove the 1.6 out on Interstate 80 and it was way too sluggish uphill.  It was embarrassing!<br><br>
