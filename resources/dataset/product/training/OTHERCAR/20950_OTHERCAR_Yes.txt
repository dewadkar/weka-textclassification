             By the way,  I made the title to make some money, sorry.  Anyways, about the Cruiser, I love it.  This vehicle is very fun and sporty.  I drive this car everywhere.  Everywhere I go it seems like I get comments from everyone.  It's a real head-turner.  This car does not drive like a classic Sports Utility Vehicle at all, more like a little sporty coupe.  If you are a mom or dad I think that this car would be good too, for the kids.  Everyone loves it, and why wouldn't they its a great ride.  You should get one as soon as you can.  They aren't as expensive as you would think either.  I bought mine for about $20,000.  I love it, and you will too!<br><br>
