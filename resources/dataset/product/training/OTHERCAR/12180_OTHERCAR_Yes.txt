            This is the first vehicle I have ever owned that wasnt a truck. I like many people out there had a serious case of JEEP ENVY. You really can see this from the lots of looks you get while driving these things around. It takes a certain mindset to really enjoy a Wrangler or CJ or YJ model. 
 If you are bothered by tire noise or wind noise or anything within a half mile that creates noise, this may not be the ride for you. The so/so sound system is barely adequite to drown out the tire and wind noise. This is one of those "grin and bare it" ordeals that comes with owning a Wrangler. 
 The noise issue aside, now the good stuff. I bought the X model Wrangler with the 4.0 liter 5 speed manuel, with AC, a hardtop, and CD player. I went very basic with limiting the factory options. 
 This Jeep is really a blast to drive. As long as you keep it at a moderate and/or legal speed. High speed manuvers are out of the question in this vehicle. It's a Jeep, not a Porsche. The steering is very precise and tight. This combined with a short(and narrow) wheelbase makes for great low speed offroading in the woods, but can be quite a handfull at the 60 mph+ range on the highway.
 I find that the 4.0 liter engine to be quite peppy and am happy with the 17MPG average I get on fuel. My 99 Dodge Ram with 360ci V8 only got @12MPG, so Im pleased with the gas mileage savings. There have been some complaining out there that the current motor is outdated and lacking power. My responce to this debate is that the motor was designed to do what the Jeep was made for. This is to give the average Guy or Gal a vehicle that is truly made for dual purposes. Those being off and on road use with nothing more than a quick shift of the transfer case from 2High to 4Low. This motor is made for lo-rev high torque power. The lo-rev motor and strong clutch make the Jeep very diffecult to stall by accident even while in 2 wheel drive on a slight incline. I beleive that this would be important to anyone that may be intimadated by a manuel transmission. It's flawless, just gently release the clutch peddle and off you go. The other noise issue I havent hit on yet is the engine and muffler sound. They are both very quiet.
 Now that you've gotten up to speed, it's time to slow down.
The breaks work well and are predictable. The Jeep tracks nice and straight while breaking hard and have always given me confidence.
 To see the true color's of the Wrangler shine, You have to shift into 4high or 4low and take it off road. Now, this is not a 130mph baja racer. Jeepin' = Creepin'. The Jeep is made for low speed taking in the scenery kind of wheeling. Here in New Hampshire, most of the off road available to us is Class 6 dirt or old overgrown logging roads through the woods. Thanks again to the short wheelbase and tight turning radius, I have been able to enjoy trails that would have stopped my long and wide Dodge Ram dead in it's tracks. 
 If you are like me and enjoy tinkering and working on your brand new vehicles, then the Jeep is a dream come true. It doesn't need anything right off the lot. But if you get the itch that most of us Jeep nuts get, there are about a million aftermarket parts out there for the swapping out on your Jeep.
 In closing there is one more thing that's really cool about
owning a Jeep. And that's the Jeep Wave. Own a TJ,CJ or YJ and that will get you waved at alot by others of the same. Even by members of the opposite sex no less. Well go ahead and buy a Jeep, start waving and tread lightly.
