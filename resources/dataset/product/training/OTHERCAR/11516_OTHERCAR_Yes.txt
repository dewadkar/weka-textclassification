            First off I was 18 years old when I bought this car. And I picked this car over a BMW because I wanted something different to "FIX" up, since everybody & their mother in my neighbor hood drives a BMW.

I bought the car May '01 & started having car problems around September '01 when it started getting cold.  I researched & at www.edmunds.com I found out I had a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) out for bad start, which I too to the Nissan Dealer & they fixed right away. But I picked up car it had scratches on the trunk & they said they were there, I told them it wasn't & blamed whoever washed my car there did it. Bottom line they didn't fix the problem & that was the last time I went to that service dept.

I then heard wind noise & found out there was another TSB out on that ( http://www.edmunds.com/ownership/maintenance/articles/44745/article.html ) & called another Nissan Dealership & got the wind noise fixed.

Also I've had excessive paint chips, & I don't do any highway driving. Which comes to conclusion that the Nissan Paint sucks....so if you buy a new car, make sure you have the 3M Clearbra installed (http://www.xpel.com  or check with your nearest Ziebart).

Now down to flaws, the suspension sucks because it has too much body roll so I installed a Front Strut Tower Brace (FSTB) & a Rear Sway Bar made by Stillen.com, which cut the body roll by alot. I also had H&R Springs installed to lower car 1.5 inches which it makes car look nicer & gives it better respond on turns.

P.S. - If you want to feel like its a Sports Sedan then buy Manual & not Automatice, because that's one mistake I did!

Also I've done alot to my car in reference to adding stuff: like a Ground Effect Kit, Exhaust, Tints, Rims & got most of my buys & ideas from forums.maxima.org ; www.custommaxima.com ; www.cardomain.com ; www.5thgenmaximas.com
