            Here's what I love about the CyberShot DSC-P1...

* it is easy to use, takes good pictures, offers flexibility due to the still/mpg options, and supports a degree of underwater/damp tolerance. This translates to a fine package, overall, for a small and portable imaging device.

Here's what I do not love about the camera...

* the battery life is marginal if the LCD is used. Since the LCD is one of the better features of the set it is hard not to use, as a means to extend battery life. A conundrum? Sony should have considered using the already standard Flash Memory devices. It just smacks too much of BetaMax to see them insert yet another format into the marketplace.

Details of use...

* I bought the Marine Pack option just before a vacation on Kauai. It is a $250.00 option which is an engineering gem. Very tight tolerances, very simple to use, includes detailed instructions on maintaining the rubber "O" ring, and some anti-fog goop.

I found snorkeling to be effortless with the device hanging from my neck on the Sony-provided cord. Despite the blistering humidity of Kauai, being wet and dry in cycles, and just using the thing - I never experienced any fogging. No leaks, very positive feeling of the controls. What I learned, the hard way, was to turn the LCD OFF when using it underwater. You can't see it using the case and all it does is eat the battery.

I would like to see a modification made to the Marine Pack. Maybe a simple little lense so the viewfinder would be zoomed up just a notch when the case is in place. As it is, I shot blindly. So it's not a professional device but it could be a tad easier to use underwater with minimal expense.

* I opted for a 64mb Memory Stick and using the 640 x 480 setting allows for just under 1000 images. This is way plenty resolution for simply passing around on a computer or posting on a web page. In addition, the ability to take up to 15 seconds of .mpg with audio lends itself to some very interesting options.

* the USB interface is problematic. On one of our Macs, running either 9.x or 10.x, it is a no-brainer and trivial to use. On my Windows 2000 machines it is a multiple step process and true to Windows, potentially dangerous to the images on the stick. CAUTION: the drivers provided with my device were outdated and in fact, completely useless. I had to plow thru Sony's web site to get the latest drivers for the USB reader I purchased from Sony. I did not even try to use the serial connection from the camera.

There are many small digital cameras on the market now, so it is probably wise to shop around. But it may be hard to find one with the combination of features and size which are better than this one. I am shopping for a 128mb Memory Stick to simply get more onto the device before I need to offload and reformat.

I am using the Marine Pack all the time as it protects the device so well, insane as that sounds.

Send me email if you wish a link to the images from Kauai. I think they pretty well counter any claims that the device takes "fuzzy" images or any of the other slams.
