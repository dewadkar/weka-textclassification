            I own a '97 SL1 with keyless entry and the 5 year extended warranty. Aside from the fact that the car is the right size and is economical for my family of three husband, self and 2.5 year old son. 
It's the ease of ownership. I'm the sterotypical female who just wants to get in the car and drive, I couldn't tell you when to change the oil or when my tires need rotating and if something is wrong with my car i just want it fixed a fixed fast. 
Saturn doesn't make me think about my car, when my oil change is due I get a post card, i take it in pay $21 they change the oil and check the other fluids run it through the car wash all while my son and I sit in the kids waiting room.
I bought this car in July of 96.
Since then my repairs have been &quot;a dead battery&quot; in 98 which was covered under the warranty and replaced for free. And just this month I had a &quot;bad brake booster&quot; I brought the car in at 3 p.m., they said they couldn't get to it, till the next day and since I had the extended warranty handed me and my son the keys to a 99 SL2 rental. They even moved my car seat from my car to the rental, along with making sure they moved some of my sons toys.
The saturn is a great car, i love the way it handles and the weight of it, other cars in it's price range seem lighter on the road and I like a car that doesn't feel &quot;plastic.&quot; It's no frills yet stylish (mine is gold) and it fits in any parking space. It's great for using a middle back seat car seat and the keyless entry is great when unlocking or popping the trunk while carrying a baby, or a squirmy toddler.
But, it's the &quot;no worry&quot; service from the dealership that has us set to buy another saturn when we buy our next car.<br><br>
