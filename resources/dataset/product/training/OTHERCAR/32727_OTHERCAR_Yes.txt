            The 1996 Mazda 626 is a wonderful vehicle. The exterior is nice looking, but dents up easy because it is lightweight. It is very quick, responds nicely and is very quiet. Also, I'm 6'5" and the interior is still comfortable for me. I drive nearly an hour to school and I fit just fine in this sports/passenger car. The only problems that I've experienced occur on wet pavement. This 4-cyl. is very powerful, but since the car is very light you can get into problems quick. During the Thanksgiving Holiday of 2000, I had the opportunity to experience a 60-mph/90 degree slide in the middle of a busy highway. I lifted the e-brake and the car straightened back out and my heart slowed back down. Overall, this car can be maneuvered during a evasive or emergency situation. I've seen some complaints posted here concerning the brakes. I drive like a typical 21 yr. old Al Unser Jr. and I've not had any problems at all with the brakes. The engine has done nothing but work perfectly. I fouled out the plugs one day while I was washing the cars engine. However, I've never had any problems with the mechanics of the vehicle that were not my fault. The other problem I've seen is the insurance rates on this car. Check with your ins. provider, but this car is expensive to insure. Finally, since my Father owns a car dealership, I get a really good deal on cars/trucks. I'm 21 years old and I've owned about 50+ vehicles already. I've never kept a vehicle this long (6 months) and I'll probably not sell it for a while. My sister wants to buy it, I can't get rid of it.
