            My wife received this camera as a birthday gift from my parents last fall, and we absolutely love it!

First of all, it's very small and built solidly. I realize that I never used my digital camera before because I didn't like lugging it around everywhere. We always have this one handy, though!

The pictures come out great, full of vibrant color. The lens is small, but the pictures are almost always awesome. Very few problems with the autofocus system, it even shows you where it's focusing on if you press the shutter halfway.

The speed of the camera is pretty good. I used to have a Kodak which required 10 seconds before you could take another picture, and this one is SO much better!

The flash is pretty good considering the diminutive size of the camera. The zoom is not fast, but very solid.

The camera is point and shoot if you don't know much about cameras, but it also has a ton of features for people who know more about what they're doing. The menu interface is very clear and easy to use.

The rechargeable battery is great, the camera comes with its own charger. The charge time is slightly long, but the battery lasts a long time. I've never had problems with it being out of power.

My one gripe about the camera is that there's a tiny switch next to the shutter which controls whether you're in video or picture mode. It easily gets switched going in or out of a camera bag, so you have to check it every time, or you might miss an important picture.

CompactFlash memory is cheap and very reliable, but some of the newer memory schemes are faster to browse pictures, etc.

We print our pictures on a Canon i850 Photo Printer, and the prints are excellent, almost like real photos.
