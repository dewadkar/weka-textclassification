            This is one of the smoothest riding cars i have ever been in.  There is little if any maintnance on this car except for the occasional required check up.  Used this car runs about 20 - 24 k.  Has remote keyless entry, car completely illuminates when activated.  Wide care which at times can be difficult to park.  Watch your speed while driving this car the engine is very quite and you will not notice how fast you are going.  Comes with spair tire, and flat tire kit, newer versions may have gps and onstar.  Great power stearing and has power controled seats.  

One big downside to this car is the ac system, it is very very load and it can be confusing on how to work it.  When it is at full throttle it sounds like someone is shaking rocks in a cup.  It also takes a long time to heat up, the ac  is fairly quickly to start going though.  We have also had troubles with the windows going down during the summer, just like our expedition.  It seems like the lining expands too much.  Another problem is that the leather on the seats crack, this can be repaired or prevented by leather softner.  One last problem has to be that the oil leaks constantly, we have brought it into the shop many times and they cant really find out what the problem is.  This car has many more pluses than it does minuses.  This car can seat up to 6 if needed but it is most comfortable with 5.  Gets great gas mileage.  Not sure of the exact but i do believe it is about 20 in the city and 25 on the highway.  After locking your car with the keyless entry make sure it is locked the signal does not always get all the way through.  Would suggest buying this car used that is where you will get the best price.  This car is also very safe dual airbags, and has a lot of protection built into the frame.  This car accelarates very quickly even for a "grandpa car".  This car has everything for a long distance traveling car to a midtown shopping expedition! Highly recomended.
