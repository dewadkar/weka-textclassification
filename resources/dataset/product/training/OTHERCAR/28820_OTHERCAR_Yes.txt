            I purchased the DC210 from Staples in August '99 on sale for $399.  Even though overall I am glad I bought this specific digital camera, I have noticed several drawbacks to what I thought was the best digital camera in the price range.

Let's start with the positives.  The best thing about the DC210 is the clear picture quality.  It offers three choices picture quality: good, better, and best. I always take pictures on best because it doesn't increase the size of the picture very much and I like the quality it gives me.  The quality of my DC210 digital pictures has been complimented again and again.  For an example of the quality, 99% of the pictures in my gallery were taken with this camera.  You can access the gallery at: &lt;A href= http://aurora.wells.edu/~rgrenier/pictures.htm &gt;http://aurora.wells.edu/~rgrenier/pictures.htm&lt;/a&gt;.

The Kodak DC210 comes with a 8MB disk inside.  Physically small, this tiny disk can hold around 40 average-sized pictures before you have to download it to your computer.  I really enjoy the size of the memory space as compared to the Sony Mavica I was using for some time, which used regular 3.5&quot; floppies instead.  It's plenty for everything I do with the camera.

As you might have been able to tell from the image quality choices (good, better, and best), you won't need a technical degree to use the Kodak DC210.  It offers a simple menu feature on the back that makes changing options easy.  Non-computer users can understand it within minutes.  This could be a drawback for the professional photographer, however, as the DC210 does not offer any advanced photography features such as shutter speed, etc.

Unlike many digital cameras (such as the Sony Mavica I had been using), the Kodak DC210 comes with an optical viewfinder.  This is great for two reasons: 1) using the LED screen to aim the camera can wear down the batteries in a matter of minutes.  2) Outdoors, in bright sunshine, the LED is almost impossible to see, which makes aiming with it impractical.  With the Sony Mavica outside in the sun I would have to just point and hope it got the target in the frame.

I also love the TV link cable that comes with the DC210.  With this you can simply and easily show the pictures contained within the camera on any television set.  You just plug one end into the camera, the other into the television (or VCR's) Video In slot.  This is a wonderful closer to family gatherings, to put on a picture show of all the pictures you've taken that day.

While the Kodak DC210 has many great features, there are a few that seem to be somewhat lacking.  For one, the software that came with it for transferring pictures from the camera to the computer.  Now it might have been my installation, but the main program didn't work at all.  It's hard to explain, but I have to go through a rather lengthy process to download my pictures and if I do anything wrong the program stops responding and I have to end task it.

The close-up option does not work very well.  For example, I wanted to take some pictures of a diamond ring, and the camera was simply unable to get detail of the setting.  I even tried the special close-up mode, but that didn't help at all.  If you will need to take very close up shots of an object the size of a ring, then the DC210 is not a good choice.  I have to add, however, that the Sony Mavica I used for a short time didn't take good close-up photos either.

If you want to zoom in on an object, the 2X optical zoom that comes with the DC210 isn't going to get you very far.  Despite the fact that I use the meager zoom all the time, it doesn't accomplish much but whet my appetite for a useful amount of zoom.  I still end up running closer and farther away from things to control the picture.

The last thing I wish the Kodak DC210 had was a rechargeable battery pack.   It takes 4 AA batteries, and I did buy rechargeable batteries for it, but they only last about 40 pictures or so before I have to recharge them again.  The Sony Mavica had a rechargeable battery pack and I remember that it lasted much longer between charges.

When I went out to buy a digital camera I bought the Kodak DC210 and still think that it was the best camera for the buck.<br><br>
