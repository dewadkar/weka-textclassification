            I purchased my relisys at one of the auction sites for $99.00 and for a digital camera it isn't bad.  I was somewhat disappointed because i had to send the first one back because the flash did not work.

I purchased this camera to shoot pics of product to upload to my website, however it will not take very good close ups and more than likely was not designed to do this kind of work.

One is very limited by the 2mb card, it would be nice if it was a little larger.  

I must say, Dimera/Relisys was very quick and nice in replacing the defective camera.

There is still what I think is a design flaw in the camera because you have to press the shutter button kind of hard to get it to flash.
