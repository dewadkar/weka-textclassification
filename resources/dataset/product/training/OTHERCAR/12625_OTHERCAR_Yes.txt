            Was an avid 35mm amature photographer since 1974 and never considered purchasing a digital camera until I saw the S10.  I purchased a Canon Elph for it's ease of having it available where ever I went.  Ths S10 came close, so I purchased the &quot;smallest&quot; digital 2.1meg pixal camera last Christmas until Canon announced the S100:(
I carried the camera in my jacket pocket without any problems, using it to take job progress pictures at work. 
Camera does have shortcomings, power consumption for one.  You definately need the rechargable battery pack with this baby.  I would imagine all digitals are battery gluttons too.
