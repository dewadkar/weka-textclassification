            Here is an update to my original article, <b>Plymouth Neon 2000 Exciting!</b> at <a href='/./auto-review-5318-24FFA00-38528D7D-bd4'>http://www.epinions.com/./auto-review-5318-24FFA00-38528D7D-bd4</a> .  We have had our car now for 11 months, and have reached the 24000 mile mark.  Overall it has been a great car, there have only been a few exceptions.  The trouble tickets are as follows:

An air conditioner problem caused the car to stall 3 or 4 times, and the car to get very hot, down here in sunny Florida.

Then we had a small problem with the mirror adjustment knob just breaking off, for no reason.

Lastly there has been quite a great bit of chatter from the brakes, especially in the early morning.  We took the car into the dealership, and they said that this is normal for Plymouth, but the brakes are okay.  It has been about 8,000 miles since then, and we have had no other problems since then.

Those are the only problems with the car as far as mechanical, but there is one more thing that I just have to add.  Eventhough it is roomy, and it is built for a wide variety of people heights and widths, the fit isn't the only thing they should have considered.  I have a very big problem at 6'2&quot; trying to see when the stop lights turn green.  I have to bend down, or ask my wife to tell me.  This is by far the biggest problem that I have with the car.

Considering this is a new car, we have put 25,328 miles on it now, it hasn't been all too bad.  All of the problems, were relatively minor, save for the air conditioning, and all were fixed while I was at work.  All of it was under warranty, so it didn't cost me a penny.  But I feel that there really shouldn't have been any problems in the first year/24,000 miles.

The good side of the car is that it still rides smooth.  It has a decent kick for such a small engine.  The problems are fixed without any effort from me.  It is still under warranty till 36,000 miles.<br><br>
