            I have owned my 2000 Avalon XLS for 6 weeks.  It is a great car--roomy, luxurious, powerful and fun to drive.  Even my 24 year old son who drives a Lexus SC300 likes the car--but clearly it has a different image.

The car has more amenities than I need, but that is part of the fun. Maybe because it is a new model, I have had several people ask me what it is and tell me what  a nice looking car it is.  Clearly it is styled like the more expensive Lexus sedans for significantly less money.  Many of the features inside are copies of those in my son's Lexus.  And I am someone who likes a &quot;bargain&quot;.

Because of its interior size, this is a great car for both the middle age person who wants a feel of luxury and for the person with a family.  A big selling point for me was also the size of the trunk.  My wife's car is a Mercedes--but the trunk is too small for a real trip.  The Avalon's trunk is big enough for plenty of suitcases.

My only criticism of the car would be the bucket seats.  They are a luxury style seat--I prefer a more wrap-around seat that holds you on the sides.  I will get used to the seat though.

I am well pleased.<br><br>
