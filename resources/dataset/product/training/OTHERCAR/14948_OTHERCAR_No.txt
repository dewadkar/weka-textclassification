            I used the Sony &quot;73&quot; model digital camera several times to decide if I wanted to purchase it for my daughter off at college.  The first time, all my pictures were taken outside and the pictures were WONDERFUL!  I loved the camera, easy to use and I especially liked the idea of using a floppy instead of buying expensive memory cards.  The second time I used the camera, all my pictures were taken inside, using the built in flash.  Some of the pictures were good, and some were not too good.  It always seems that the best shots ended up too dark.  I don't know if it was the flash that didn't work or if it is just not good enough to use indoors.  




The Sony 73 is a fairly inexpensive camera ($500), but since the indoor shots were not satisfactory, I decided to move up a model to the Sony 83.  For a difference of $200, it is worth having all the shots turn our good.  The Sony 83 has wonderful indoor pictures and better clarity.

The Sony 73 is very easy to use, fairly inexpensive and great if most of your shots are taken outside.  Else, do like me and spend another $200 and buy the Sony 83.  It's worth the difference in money.<br><br>
