            Picture it:  August 1999.  A hot humid Connecticut Sunday.  After spending the entire day antiquing and browsing the junk shops in and around Litchfield and Fairfield county Connecticut in my 1987 Mercury Colony Park Station wagon, complete with wood paneling and enough seating/cargo capacity for the Boston Pops (but no cup holders,) I was on my way back home when my trusty &quot;house on wheels&quot; caught fire.  The good news: no one was hurt and no newly purchased articles had been damaged.  The bad news: the Colony Park had taken it's last trip under it's own steam and was a total loss with only 70,000 miles on her.  

This left me in a predicament.  I had to find another car soon as I was renting one in the meantime and was spending a pretty penny doing so.  I cruised around to many dealerships. I was in the market for a wagon as I like the conveniences they offer and didn't want a contemporary monster SUV or a refrigerator-looking mini van.  I went to Subaru to look at the Outback Wagon, Saturn to look at the LS Wagon, Volkswagen to look at the Passat Wagon when I finally ended up at Daewoo in Fairfield Connecticut. I had seen this curious but attractive car on the road a few times and decided I'd better go and check it out. 

I was pleasantly surprised when I looked at the Nubira Wagon up close.  The high-end CDX model had all the bells and whistles that I'd come so accustomed to in my Mercury, with a few more modern conveniences like anti-lock brakes, a CD player with 6 speakers and alloy rims.  I was amazed when I saw the fit and finish and the quality of materials and workmanship put into these very attractive yet very affordable cars!  For just over $16,000 you can get one loaded, complete with leather seats too!  

Although the Nubira is a bit smaller than the wagons that I mentioned above, it has great head and leg room and is easy to get in and out of. I got mine with the power moonroof and I'm glad.  I saw a Nubira without one and the dome light is mounted in the center of the roof toward the back, which lights up the back seat and not the front.  With the sunroof option, the dome light is mounted together with the controls for the sunroof directly over the rearview mirror.  Much better.   Many times with a small car one sometimes feels like they're riding in a soda can, but the Nubira has a solid ride, corners well and is pretty peppy once I got used to the fact that it had half the engine that my Mercury had. Oh, and it handles well in snow and rain too, and will do a nice 85 on the turnpike without any jiggles, rattles or shimmies. 

All in all, this car has a great deal of &quot;bang for the buck,&quot; compared to the sticker price for the Subaru and the Volkswagon, and I still find it amusing to see people nearly drive off the road looking at this car when I'm at a stop sign or traffic light; nobody knows what it is and I'm amazed at how it's attracted so much attention!  I realize I took a great gamble on purchasing one since the company hasn't been in this country very long, but I did my homework and they've been selling cars all over the world for years.  The way I looked at it is that Saturn was once an unknown, and so was Subaru for that matter.  (Remember the Brat?)  

I really don't have anything terrible to say about this car.  Did I mention that all scheduled maintenance is paid for by the dealer for the first 36,000 miles or 3 years and they provide free roadside assistance too?  The only thing I wish this car had are body side moldings.  (Daewoo added them to the 2000 Nubiras.)  I would highly recommend this car to people who like the convenience of a wagon and are looking for a ride that won't break the bank.     <br><br>
