            I am on my second Pathfinder.  Both times I had purchased a Pathfinder, I had gone out and looked at all the available SUV's on the market.  For the price range I was looking for, I could not find a SUV that I would prefer more.  The first time I had looked there was only 1 other SUV that I would have preferred, but it was out of my price range and that would be a Jeep Cherokee Unlimited ($$$$$$$).  The second time I looked, if I could have afforded more, I would again have liked the Jeep Cherokee Unlimited or a Lexus SUV (again...$$$$$$).

I very much like the looks of the Pathfinder.  I specifically like the SE (Sports Edition).  The only things that I had to get extra was a sunroof and the tire carrier (my own personal liking).  Everything else was included in the price.  

After test driving a lot of the SUV's, I really enjoyed the driving comfort of the Pathfinder.  My passengers also have had no complaints.  Except for one time, I had a passenger in the backseat and he complained that the seat back was too far back.  I told him that there was a reclining adjuster and that made him happy.

Mechanically, I have only had the basic repairs.  Oil changes, new tires, etc...

I am very happy and I would highly recommend the Nissan Pathfinder!!!<br><br>
