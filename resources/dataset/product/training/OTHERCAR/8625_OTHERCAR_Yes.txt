            This van was made with precision and quality in mind. Driving down the road there are no rattles, no squeeks, and when idleing it is very hard to hear the engine. At higher revs the engine can be heard but it is almost a soothing sound.

With lots of power in a small vehicle it makes getting through that intersection so much easier. That 2 minute wait is now a 2 second wait because the driver can be certain that there is enough exceleration to make it through and fast.

This is the first minivan that I actually like. To me all minivans are ugly no matter what but this one isn't too bad looking concidering it's competion.

The sound system is very nice, (but deffinitly not for people who like loud music). Right on the steering wheel there are volume and station/track controls to make things much easier. 

I was very surprised at the ride quality of this van. It holds the road very tightly and is so smooth that higher speeds might creep up on someone so be careful. Did i mention quiet,,, well if you are a stressed out person this may be just what you need,, a relaxing ,, quiet drive home,, not clunk, clunk, clang.
