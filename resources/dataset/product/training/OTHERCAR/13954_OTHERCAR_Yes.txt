                I have a 1998 Metro that is my driving around car and it's exactly what I wanted.  I bought it after being fed up with my Jeep and all of the maintenance and gas it guzzled.  Bottom line is, if you need a pretty good little car and don't want to be friendly with you gas station attendant, this is a great car for you.
    I recently calculated my mileage, and I get about 41 mpg for a mix of highway and city driving.  This is what I was looking for!!!
    I live in Colorado, so I was a little concerned with the winter handling of my Manly Metro, but it has performed better than many cars on the road.  I think that it is so light that it floats across the snow rather than sinking in.  The only time that I've slid was when I was testing the brakes to see how far it would take to stop.
    The major drawbacks are space and acceleration/power.  It has neither in any sort of great quantities.  Rear seat only holds two people, while the trunk is tiny.  The power that the engine develops is enough to merge into traffic, but you have to plan ahead.  At sea level, I noticed a major increase in power from borderline to barely there.  Focus on the gas gauge.<br><br>
