            The Epson Camera is a digital camera that gets you into digital photography at a reasonable price.  I have two digital cameras.  I wrote a review about the Dimera 3500 by Relisys last week, check it out.  The Epson is our other digital camera.

I have had excellent success with the Epson.  The camera is easy to operate, the quality of the pictures are good and the features okay.  This camera allows for digital pictures with audio attachments.  The button that starts the audio recording is small and I've accidentally hit it when taking a picture.  This is annoying especially if you are a motor mouth like me.

There is a self-timer so that you can hop into your own pictures and a sliding lens cover that protects the lens and shuts off the camera.

The camera is powered by 4 &quot;AAA&quot; batteries or a plug in AC/DC converter.  It features a LCD display on the top that indicates battery power, number of pictures in memory and audio mode.  It's hard to read.  With a built in flash, once you open the package and insert the batteries you are ready to take pictures.

Like my other camera the interface with your computer is a serial connector.  Downloading pictures into your computer is rather slow but not as slow as my Dimera 3500.  I'm spoiled by my video camera and my HP scanner which attach to the USB for extremely fact interfacing.

Battery life is acceptable and it's easy to buy replacements because they are a standard size.  Like both cameras I strongly recommend you get an adapter to save your batteries when you are at your computer.  A lot of power is expended in the downloading process.

I recommend the Epson Digital Camera.  I'm in the process of evaluating photography software.  It is my experience that the software is the weak or strong link is camera ease of use and functionality.  If you have trouble getting pictures into your computer then no matter what the brand of camera, digital photography becomes troublesome.
