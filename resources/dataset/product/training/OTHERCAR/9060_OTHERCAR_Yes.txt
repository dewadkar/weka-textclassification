            I have 2 325s in my family, one 4 dr 325i, one 2dr 325IS.  

The cars were pricy when I bought them.   But after close to 8-9 year of ownership, and having put over 200,000 KM on them, I will have to say that these were the most reliable cars ever built.

Engine - Runs like new, except for minor regular tune ups, the engine gives you what you want.  Your step on it, you will get it, as with any other BMWs !

Electricals - No major problems whatsoever except light bulb changes.  Power windows works fine at 190,000 KM.  

Transmission - Smooth and quick, no timing delays, even at 190,000 KM

Snow perfornamce - 50/50 weight distribution helps this car in the snow a lot, but snow tires are a must

Comfort - Fronts seats are very comfortable, firm and good lumbar support, head rest are not best, but much better than those   domestics where the head rest are 12 inches away from your head

Service Parts - I have been using Bosch Parts or after market "Made for BMW" German parts, they work just as good, but they are approx. 60% the price of original BMW parts.

Rust - Rust are beginning to show on the edge of the rear trunk lid (after 190,000 km and 8 years).  No where else on the body has rust.

Body cage - Very rigid body cage, like new !

Suspension - Not as firm as before, but....after 190,000 KM, what do you expect ?!  I am still using the original factory shocks and suspension !

Bottom Line, for looks, engine feel, power, overall comfort, no other car in its class can top 3 series in my opinion.

Electrical problems for BMW are a thing of the past.   The old style BMW 3 series do have some electrical problem, but not this model.  I have no electrical problems whatsoever.

----

I sold these 2 cars recently and got a very good resale value !

93 4 Door 325i with 200K, I got $ 6650 U.S for it.
93 2 Door, 325is with 130k, I got $ 8750 U.S for it !

Excellent resale value if you ask me !
