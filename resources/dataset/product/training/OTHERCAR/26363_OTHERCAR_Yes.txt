            We bought this car about a year and a half ago. We bought it because we thought it would be a great family car, since we were thinking about having a baby soon. Soon after purchasing it , we found out we were, indeed, going to have a baby.

The Jimmy drives and handles relatively well. The steering is a little more responsive than most of the other cars we have owned. My husband has some trouble steering it.

The real problem came into play when we tried to install an infant seat. First of all, the manufacturer does not recommend placing the seat in the rear center position. They state that the seat will not be secure there. Instead, we have had to place the seat on the driver side. We still had trouble installing it there. It takes several towels propped under the base of the Infant Seat to make it fit securely.

The second problem is that it is almost impossible to maneuver the seat in and out of the door. Almost every time, we end up hitting the seat against the door or the rear seat before we get the baby out or in the Jimmy.

On the other hand, the back cargo area is wonderful for changing diapers, and there is a ton of space to carry strollers, diaper bags, etc.

My opinion is that this is a great car for individuals, but if you are looking for a family car, you might want to look elsewhere.
