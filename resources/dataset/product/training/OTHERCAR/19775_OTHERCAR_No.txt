            When my old subaru had seen better days, after many years or dependability, I decided to purchase another.  I bought a new 1992 Subaru Loyale fully loaded.  I thoroughly expected many years of trouble-free driving.  However, this was not to be the case.  I had purchased an extended warranty, and thank goodness for that.  

The head gasket had to be replaced three times during the five year warranty period, as well as the timing belt.  The car currently has 160,000 miles on it, with a the following major repairs/issues since purchase:  3 head gaskets, 3 timing belts, new transmission, complete engine seals, 3 sets of struts, trim molding and door seals falling off to name a few. 

 I was also disappointed with the body integrity from the start.  Shortly after purchase I was finding small cracks in the clear coat in the rear quarter panels.  At first I couldn't figure it out, it appeared that any items in the trunk were causing the cracking from the inside out and I'm not talking large heavy items(flashlight, book bag, groceries).

In the car's defense,  I must say I truly enjoyed it in its younger day with all its amenities.  However, I had fully expected the car to be relatively problem free, as my previous subaru had been.  Perhaps, I just got a lemon, but either way, now I have a sour taste in my mouth for subarus. <br><br>
