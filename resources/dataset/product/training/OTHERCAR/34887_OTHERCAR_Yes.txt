            With a new baby we decided on the 2000 Honda Odyssey. We LOVE the space and the idea we can seperate or put together the 2nd row captains chairs and the third row folds very easily into the floor! It provides a smooth ride---but watch the speeding tickets this vehicle is fast! Only problem we have had is the  right rear sliding door handle fell off but was fixed promptly! We decided on the LX model to save on $$$, the EX model has the automatic slider but our salesman says they tend to break because the weight put on the door motor. This is an Excellent Van for the money-don't be confused by the Toyota Sienna's cost-compare the space!!!<br><br>
