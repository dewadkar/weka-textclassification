            Back in 1997, I was looking for a new car that was half-way sporty looking and reliable. I visited every dealer in town only to be ignored or over-pressured. Finally, I wound up at Pontiac. At first I was a little reluctant to even take a look at any of the cars because frankly, I didn't think Pontiac made sporty cars. I had only heard of their luxury cars like the Bonneville or their family-oriented cars like the Grand Am. I knew they had discontinued production on the Sunbird but I had no idea they had replaced it with the Sunfire. &quot;Wow!&quot; was my initial reaction to the only Sunfire they had on the lot. I decided to take it for a test drive and was really impressed with the way it handled. My only beef was with the color. Fortunately, the dealer pointed to the indoor showroom and lo and behold, I saw a green Sunfire. So, to make a long story short...I bought a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire SE Sedan that same day. 

A few of the features I love best about the Sunfire are the standard ABS brakes and daytime running lamps. I live in Alaska where the roads are hell in the winter time. It's nice to have anti-lock brakes, not to mention the huge discount on auto insurance you normally get for this added feature. The daytime running lamps come in handy for me since I often forget to turn my headlights on and with only 4 hours of daylight in Alaska at certain times of year, this can be a life saver. 

I've owned this car for close to 3 years and haven't had any major problems with it. Once, a few months after I bought it, the <i>check engine</i> light came on without due reasoning. I took it to the dealership and they fixed it in 5 minutes. The mechanics told me that the pressure gage was reading wrong from not tightening the gas cap on all the way. They just had to reset the computer. I have no idea why that occurred really, but it's never happened since then. 

The Pontiac Sunfire also comes equipped with an Anti-Theft Deterrent which is basically a feature that only allows the vehicle to be started with a key. This was a problem for me...I wanted to have command-start installed and was told that it wasn't possible since the system could not be overridden. I was also told that Pontiac was working on something to override it. That was 2 years ago, so they may have figured something out by now. 

Also, Pontiac sent out a recall for repair on this model due to overly-sensitive airbags. I never brought it in for repair since my Sunfire had already been in a front end collision (grrrr...my older brother is the culprit). Anyways, the airbags didn't go off during the accident so I'm assuming my particular car has no problems with the airbags being <i>too</i> sensitive. I'm wondering if they even work at all. 

The reliability of this car makes up for the few minor problems I've had with it. If it can withstand -40 temperatures and start hassle-free, I'm satisfied. If it can plow through snow a foot deep, I'm satisfied. If it can stop on a road that looks like a mirror, I'm satisfied...let's just say that I'm really satisfied with my Sunfire.
