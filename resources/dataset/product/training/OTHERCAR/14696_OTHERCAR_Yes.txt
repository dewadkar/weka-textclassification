            I looked at and test drove several of the Consumer Reports top-rated cars in the 'Small SUV' category. This included the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V. While the Forester doesn't initially feel as large as the Honda, it has a great personality and is, dare I say it, fun to drive?! I got the Forester L, with very few of the bells and whistles, and I have to say it's one of the best cars I've ever owned. It is a great value for an SUV, and I have had absolutely no problems with it, aside from oil changes. Good gas mileage (I get anywhere from 23-27 mpg), and enough punch in the engine (~165 hp, I believe) makes it far superior to either the Honda or RAV4. Full-time 4WD and anti-lock brakes make it an even better value. And none of the &quot;tippiness&quot; that you get with a lot of the taller SUVs.

Bottom line: If you're looking for a low-cost, high quality SUV, this is it. Get it.

(Oh, and it has great looking fog lights, too!)<br><br>
