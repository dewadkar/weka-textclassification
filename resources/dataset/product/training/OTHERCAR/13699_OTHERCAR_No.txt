            I've owned my Mazda 626 LX for over 3 years now.  After purchasing it new for my wife in August 1999 and logging around 37,500 miles, I can safely say I wouldn't buy another.

First of all, this is a comfortable car that still runs and handles great.  But there have been a few little problems with it that make me wonder if it isn't time to let it go.

Hmmm.... where to start, after the first couple years, the trunk started filling up with water.  I live in Oregon and it rains a lot! Thinking it was the trunk seal, I closely inspected it for cracks or tears, there were none. So I cleaned it really good, dried out the trunk and sprayed water over it for about 10 minutes.  Trunk still dry, problem fixed!  Not.  The next time it rained I had a trunk full of water again.  To keep a long story short, the problem turned out to be the "plastic" pressure relief valve hidden behind a side panel in the passenger side of the trunk.  A clip had broken off for whatever reason and water was coming in through the wheel well.  Instead of replacing it with another cheapo, overpriced part, I just used RTV sealant to seal it up.  Problem solved.

Shortly after the trunk problem, the power antenna stopped working.  It made a horrible grinding noise whenever it tried to extend or retract, like the gears went bad.  I just disconnected it. One less thing to go wrong now.

Next on the list is the cooling system, the car started overheating, it was losing coolant.  Fortunately, it never got hot enough to do any real damaged.  But what happened is the "plastic" coolant reservoir had developed several cracks in it and was leaking.  The reservoir is also where you add coolant, not directly in the radiator.  This also caused the heating system to stop working correctly even when refilled. It seems it is quite dependent on the systems ability to fully pressurize.  This problem was very easily fixed by buying a new part ($55.00). By the way the thermostat went bad at almost exactly 20k miles, and according to the service manual, it should be replaced at this point.  Interesting.

There are a few other minor annoyances not worth mentioning except one that just cropped up a couple days ago.  I cannot open the rear passenger side door from the inside or out, it simply won't unlock.  Since the door is closed, I can't remove the door panel to see what the problem is.  This means I am going to have to cut into it to get to the linkage in the door itself.  Yeehaa.

I am one of those people that take very good care of my vehicles and follow scheduled maintance to the letter.  Even so much as to only buy fluids and parts from the manufacturer and clean the engine compartment and undercarriage once a year.  The family and I do a lot of camping in remote areas and the last thing I want is a breakdown,

I purchased this car new expecting it to last at least 10 years, but now, because of the quality issues I've experienced with this Mazda, I will be looking to sell it next year.  It still looks like new!

Would I buy another?  Not on your life.
