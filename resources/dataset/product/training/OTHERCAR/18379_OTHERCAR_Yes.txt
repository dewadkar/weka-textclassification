            If you like sports compact cars, you can't go wrong with a 1998 Tiburon FX model.  5 Speed transmission, 2 liter engine, sleek body design and nice interior design.

The car definitely turns heads! Admirable body design and even great rims to boot! Most cars don't offer this much &quot;Out of the box&quot; for the price this machine goes for.

FX model has great factory sound, nice interior as well as enhanced fog lights, rear window washer and other nice features.

The engine is powerful, but the car weighs so darn much a lot of it is wasted. On the other hand, because of its weight and frame it sticks to the road like no other. If you're into performance you can get an extra 20 to 30 horsepower just putting in better spark plugs, increasing the exhaust pipe diameter and giving the engine intake more air to breathe. The car will be much zippier with just some basic modifications.

My only complaint has been I don't get to drive it much :), my girlfriend has kind of adopted it as her own baby!  The car really does take a licking and keep on ticking. Taught my girlfriend to drive stick on this vehicle and it has not burped once. Very nice and smooth on shifting and the feel of the road.

You can't beat the warranty or the price. This vehicle is a must buy if you don't mind small sports vehicles. Save money on insurance and get antilock brakes and an alarm.
