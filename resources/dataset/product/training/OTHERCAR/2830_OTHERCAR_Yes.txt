            I've waited until I had a solid year behind the wheel of my 2001 GS430 before I wrote this review, which by the way is my very first. This car continually impresses you anew just when you thought you knew every capability. For instance, my initial impression of the road feel was that of being too "un BMW like"  for a true sports sedan. However as I became more confident with the car and kept pushing it more and more, I found that the active suspension kept this vehicle tracking the curves like it was on rails. Yet when I was in a sedate mood, the Lexus GS pampered me like my fathers big ole Lincoln. I also thought the car was almost too quiet and isolating, at first. But I quickly became used to that unique Lexus feel. So much so that when I drive in my friends BMW 540, it is almost annoying. And of course the most amazing part of this car is the V8. 300 HP is not unique, but the incredible amount of torque which pushes the GS from 0 to 60 MPH in under 6 seconds is again, truly amazing. And all this while you wonder why you can't hear any noise from the engine.  Fit and finish is about as perfect as a mass produced machine can be. I really believe this will be the first car I will keep for more than 3 years. In fact if I were to try to drive this car into the ground, I might not last long enough. Also, the navigation system is a must have.
