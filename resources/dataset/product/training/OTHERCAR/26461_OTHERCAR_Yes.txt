            We have owned our Cherokee Sport for about 5 years.  Currently, it has about 140,000 miles on it.

It has been very reliable, and has never broken down.  The only major problem, if you can call it that, was that a new water pump was needed at 100,000 miles.  The old one started leaking.  Other than that, only routine maintenance such as brakes, spark plugs, and such has been changed.

The engine, the high output 4.0L, is bulletproof although a bit noisy.  At times, it sounds a little like a diesel engine, but from my research it's normal for these engines and does not affect durability.  The engine makes 190hp and roughly 220 ft-lbs of torque. 

Acceleration is decent.  I put my G-Tech in, to see what 0-60mph times would be.  The best time of 7.8 seconds was achieved with power braking off the line.  That time is comparable to many family sedans, and actually faster than some cars.  The engine could use a little more horsepower on the top end, like during times on the highway when you need to pass someone, but it's still not bad.

The automatic transmission has been rock solid, probably one of the few newer Chrysler transmissions that are decent.  No problems yet.

The A/C still works great, and has never needed service, same with the heater.

Paint still doing well.

Gas mileage averages between 17 and 18 mpg.

The only negative things I could say is that it rides a little rough, and the interior is a little plain jane.  Those two things do not bother me, though.  Along the lines of handling, it maneuvers very well due to a tight turning radius.  It's easier to drive than my automatic corvette.

I can say without a doubt it's the best old vehicle I have owned.
