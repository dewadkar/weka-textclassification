            The Nissan Maxima (since the 1980s) has always been the superstar of the Nissan family car line-up; until the past few years. When the Maxima's lesser model; the Nissan Altima, was reinvented in 2002, the famous Maxima quickly lost its appeal and claim to be Nissan's most innovative family sedan. The 2002 Altima offers almost as much interior room, a more advanced chassis, a cheaper price,  comparable optional and standard equipment all in a more attractive package. While the Maxima SE is still an impressive car for the 2003 model year, it's its awkward appearance, and major competition with the Altima and other cars in its class that has inevitably lead to a dramatic decline in sales and overall demand. With an extreme makeover in the works for 2004, the Nissan Maxima should be able to reclaim its thrown, until then the 2003 Altima will reign queen in Nissan's family car segment.

For the 2003 model year the Nissan Maxima comes in 3 trim lines, the GXE, GLE, and the SE (tester). All trim lines are equipped with the same refined 3.5 liter VQ DOHC V6 which pumps out an impressive 255 horses at 5,800 RPM and 246 lb-ft of torque (10 more horsepower than the Altima 3.5 SE). Instead of the standard set-up, the SE comes with a sport tuned suspension, along with a standard 6-speed manual. An optional 4-speed fully automatic (equipped in tester) is available as well at no charge.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

The Nissan Maxima SE, since its reintroduction in 1989 as the 3rd generation has always been a family car that offered more than just family car attributes, it also offered a fair dose of fun, especially when equipped with the 5-speed manual transmissions. For 2003 the Maxima still retains a fun factor, a fun factor cars such as the Ford Taurus/Toyota Camry could only dream of. Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b>, even with the 4-speed fully automatic is fast, and is notably faster than the already quick 3.0 powered Maxima's of 1990-2001. I have not tested the standard 6-speed manual since the 3.5 unit was transplanted in the Maxima for the 2002 model year; I assume there is a notable difference in acceleration there as well. Increase in torque with the 3.5 vs the 3.0 gives the automatic more punch from a full stop, or when putting the pedal to the metal between 5-10 MPH. Taking off from a standing start seems much more smooth vs the 3.0 as well. Torque steer and other FWD characteristics are noticeable on take-off, however not overly so, and were much less than expected, especially after driving the Altima which seemed to suffer far worse from torque steer with the same 3.5 unit. The 3.5 twin cam engine remains calm at idle, under full throttle, and keeps its composure all the way to redline. Many V6s such as the Duratec in the Taurus seem to get fussy after 4,000 RPM, not so with the SE. Another notable feature of the SE is the refinement of the automatic transmission. Never clunking into gear, or slipping under full throttle. This 4-speed automatic shifts seamlessly adding to the excellent performance and overall refinement of the 2003 Nissan Maxima's powertrain.

 In the past, the Nissan Maxima SE has always been a good family hauler/handler, and for the 2003 model year the SE can still boast better <b>handling</b> skills than much of the competition. While slight lean is present in sharp turns, it's nowhere near as prevalent as in cars like the Ford Taurus, Chevy Impala, or Dodge Intreped ES. The 2003 Maxima SE's little sister, the 2003 Altima 3.5 SE, however seemed much more of capable of handling twisty roads without as much lean/body roll. The 2003 Maxima is no car you would want to put up against a sports coupe in a slalom, yet it's more of handler than many of its FWD rivals and is relatively easy to drive on winding roads at high speeds. 
The 2003 Maxima SE comes standard with wide low profile tires (P225/50VR17s) which aid in grip and composure. 

<b>Note:</b> For the 2004 model year the Maxima is due for a suspension upgrade. 

 On the freeway or when <b>cruising</b> through town the Maxima SE keeps its occupants in a calm environment. Small bumps, road reflectors, and road imperfections are kept devoid from the cabin with only the occasional 'thud' over rough surfaces. The SE's suspension seems a bit too soft for it to be considered a 'sport tuned suspension,' however this perfectly fine with me, a Lotus like ride just would not fit the character of the 2003 Nissan Maxima. At high speeds between 65-75 MPH the Maxima remains quiet, wind, engine, and roadgrain noise are next to none. Passing power at this speed is excellent as well. For quick passing maneuvers the gated shifter can be brought from 'D' to '3' which allows for amazing passing power one would normally expect from a V8 powered automobile. This same kind of power can also be appreciated on steep inclines. Due to the amazing amount of power achieved at a relatively low RPM never did the transmission 'have' to down-shift, even on steep 7% grades. Light work is made of any hill or steep incline that the terrain has to offer. Other than the Nissan Altima 3.5 SE, which has the same power plant, the Maxima is one of the best hill climbers in the family car category I have driven with a MSRP under $30,000. 

<b>Braking</b> is excellent which provided very smooth operation. Never did I feel a vibration in the steering wheel when coming to a stop, and fade was not present whatsoever. Unlike the Altima 3.5 SE, the 2003 Maxima comes equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes coupled with 4-wheel ABS as standard equipment. The Altima has this set-up only as an option. This excellent braking offered from the Maxima SE is also an asset that beats out most of the competition, i.e the Ford Taurus SES which comes with rear drum brakes as standard equipment.

<b>Note:</b> Traction control is an option ($300).


<b>Fuel economy</b> is a little disappointing. With a reported EPA of 20/26 this puts the Nissan Maxima SE's EPA on par with cars like the full sized 1994-1996 LT1 V8 powered Chevrolet Caprice Classics. With the technology Nissan uses with this VQ V6 one would think fuel economy specs would be much better. Much less sophisticated cars like the Chevy Impala and Ford Taurus receive better fuel economy according to the EPA. 

<i>Interior/Accommodation:</i>

The <b>interior</b> of the Maxima SE is somewhat set-up like the Nissan Altima, only the SE wins hands down in the refinement department. While the Altima may boast a more appealing interior design to many buyers, it's the Maxima that uses much better materials throughout the cabin and feels and looks much richer. From the map pockets, to the center dash, everything in the Maxima seems well placed and made with the quality one would expect from a car with an as tested MSRP of over $27,000. Nissan could improve a bit with the plastics here, but as it stands, the interior quality is far superior to anything else Nissan has to offer in the family car category. Unlike the Altima 3.5 SE, the Maxima SE does not use an excessive quantity of titanium accents. If titanium accents are your jig, the 'titanium edition package' (a $1,000 option) offers more of this type of simulated metal throughout the cabin, other amenities such as a Bose 6-disc in-dash CD player are included with this package.

Like the Altima, the Maxima SE offers easy to read instrumentation, and easy access to the HVAC and stereo  controls. The instrument cluster looks a bit trivial at first, yet retains all the gauges you need. Titanium accents are used throughout the cabin (including around the gated leather shifter), yet Nissan didn't go overboard here. The gauges, this year, are light gray instead of white which is supposed to look like titanium, Nissan didn't succeed here, which is just fine with me beings titanium accents are not my cup of tea. Standard equipment is plentiful. AC, CC, 8-way power drivers seat, 2 12 volt power outlets, air filtration, 4 cup holders ( 2 deep cup holders in front), outside temp gauge, power everything, and much more. The standard 6-speaker single AM/FM CD/tape stereo system sounds good, however an upgrade to the 7 speaker Bose 6-disc in-dash CD system is probably the way to go if music is a major priority when commuting. Options and packages are almost endless. My tester came with a power sunroof, ($800) and floor mats ($80), <b>NissanDriven.com</b> has a whole list of standard equipment, prices, packages, and options.

<b>Note:</b> Other trim lines, such as the GLE, offer simulated wood trim, so don't expect every Maxima to have the same interior set-up.

Seating is much better than I expected. The cloth bucket seats are wonderfully supportive, and the 8-way power adjustments aid in a great drivers position enabling good reach to the pedals, and all the gadgetry on the dash. The center console, like the Altima, doubles as an arm rest. This is no substitute for a full padded arm rest, although the soft plastic arm rest provided in the SE is adequately comfortable on the arms. The leather wrapped steering wheel is thick and the audio/CC controls are mounted on the wheel which is always a nice feature, especially for those of us with short arms. A 60/40 split bench rear seat can be found in the rear which can accommodate 3 adults.

 Both storage and interior room are amazing. Like a full sized sedan, the Maxima feels airy and offers room everywhere. Plenty of head and leg room is offered whether you are in the front or in the back. I imagine this car could cater to even very large men and women with no problem whatsoever. The trunk is also very spacious. My only qualm with the trunk is that the inlet into the cabin is a bit small, only small items can fit through the small passageway.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

The <b>exterior</b> is where my major gripes lie with this car. The 2003 Maxima looks very awkward, and to is one of the most homely post '2000  modeled cars I have driven to date. While totally different looking than the '96-'99 Tauruses, I feel both these cars have the same sort of undesirable styling characteristics. The front fascia is attractive enough, but from almost any other angle the car just looks like it was rushed into production with little thought put into visual design. I usually don't bash a car too much for its visual styling, however the 2003 Maxima is just too much of a personal eye sore for me to ignore. The car looks almost like a large version of the first generation Nissan Altima which retains a 'tennis shoe like' appearance. I did not like this design with the first generation Altima, nor do I like it with the even more awkward and larger 2003 Nissan Maxima. On a positive note, good looking 6-spoke 17" alloy rims are added as standard equipment on the SE trim lines.

<b>Note:</b> A rear spoiler is standard with SE trim lines.


<i>Price & Warranty:</i>

 Base price for the SE starts at around $25,000, however with the options on my tester such as a sunroof, and floor mats the price rose to a little over $28,000 after taxes and all other charges. The MSRP of the Maxima suggests a good value, however cars like the Passat, Camry, and Accord seem to offer more bang for your buck in the refinement department. Nissan offers an adequate 3 year 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty with a 5 year, 60,000 mile powertrain warranty. 

<i>Final Notes:</i>

The 2003 Nissan Maxima SE represents a good buy in the new car market. The interior is up to par, acceleration is excellent, and the ride is fairly smooth. 
The 2003 Nissan Maxima might not blow my skirt up with its homely styling cues, however the Maxima is a competent family sedan which competes fairly well with the competition (in some cases blows the competition out of the water). I'm going to rate the Maxima at 3 stars, losing 2 major stars for its sloppy exterior design and somewhat dated chassis. If you are in the market for a new Maxima, you might want to wait another year for the ( from what I hear) improved 2004 models due out in the latter part of 2003.
