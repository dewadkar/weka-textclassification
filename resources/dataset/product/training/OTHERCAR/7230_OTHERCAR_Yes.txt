            Bought this vehicle because I liked it's looks.  And I think it's a good car to pass on to my oldest daughter when she is ready to drive. (By then I'll have it paid for and hopefully it will be a good used 1st car for her) 

My ONLY problem with my new Cougar is the fact that the rear view mirror is so lowly  mounted on the front windsheild that it blocks 20% of my view. DANGEROUSLY!!! I've checked in to having it moved up...but the after market car specialist are afraid of breaking my windshield to move it.  I HAVE to have this moved up or I will have an accident.  I've even slumped down as far as possible in my seat and still it blocks alot of my view.  The view it blocks is right in front of me..which is very bad.  I am not a tall person.  5'5&quot;.  I have a sister that is 4'11&quot; who tried it to see what she thought and she too could not see because of the position of this mirror.  It's very dangerous. What can I do to get it moved up the right way without ruining my windshield????<br><br>
