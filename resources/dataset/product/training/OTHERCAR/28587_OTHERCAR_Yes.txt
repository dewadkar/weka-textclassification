            The Jeep, which once began as a military vehicle, has evolved from many generations of critiquing.  It has been used by the post office, and lately it has become a very popular car for anyone.  It still has the great off road capabilities it has always had while over the years gaining a few improvements that make commuting every day not such a terrible thing.  The 4.0-liter V6 of the Wrangler Sport edition adds the much-desired power in the engine.  The Wrangler Sport, despite its small turning radius and great maneuverability, is still entirely truck.  This can be noticed quite easily by its one bad characteristic, the noise.  Road noise while driving this truck at high speeds can be all but pleasant.  What it lacks on the highway it makes up for off of it.  The Wrangler is the ideal off road vehicle with its Quadra-coil suspension.  One the down side, the other thing I hate about the Wrangler Sport other than the noise is the soft top being a pain in the butt to get on and off.  But, I would still recommend this vehicle to the diehard Jeep fans and those of us who love being able to drive anywhere and everywhere.  <br><br>
