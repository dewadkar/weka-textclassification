            I bought a Saturn SL1 and was one of the first 500 buyers at the dealership that I bought it from.  I had shopped all over and I could not find anything within the $10-15,000 price range that was worth anything.  I owned it for seven years and never had a real problem with it. 
Driving the Saturn was good, not perfect, but superb for the price ($14,700) that I paid for it.  The suspension was excellent, but the engine was a bit noisy.  Also, we had some minor difficulties such as the seat belts froze up and the locks and windows had certain problems, and had to get the stereo replaced within the first couple of months, but nothing that big was wrong with it.  
I live in Colorado and as anyone who has ever been here for any extent of time may very well know, some of the mountain roads are tough to get over.  I would drive over the Vail Summit and other passes that slowed most cars to a near halt; but my Saturn passed them all.  Left them in the dust.  I would greatly recommend the Saturn SL 1 to anyone who lives in this sort of climate.  Also, the front wheel drive brought driving in the snow to new heights as it is almost required out here.  I loved that car, but unfortunately I wrecked it on the side of the road as I was driving home from Las Vegas way to fast I suppose; but that's another story:-)<br><br>
