    My friend has a blue dodge durnago and has three kids and is an outdoors type of gut and this car fits him perfectly. He has a dvd player in the back which keeps his kids happy and he also has a cd player in the front, awesome speakers, and a leather interior. This car has a whole list of great features and no faults to it. The interior is cosey which is good for long road trips or for trips to the mountains for the outdoors type, has plenty of room, and hadels like a glove just about everywhere you take it. Also, besides being a good family car, it's awesomly stylish and can also count as a luxury/sporty/family type of car. Overall this is a fantastic car and will make any suv lover happy as can be. <br><br>
