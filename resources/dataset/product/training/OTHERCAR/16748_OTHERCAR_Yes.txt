            When my husband first told me he wanted us to get a Lincoln Town Car my first thought was that it was an old people car! I thought it was one of those vehicles you got when you were old enough to apply for your Social Security. Boy, was I wrong! This is the greatest car and when we ride in it we are riding in pure luxury! 
The accessories and features are so numerous! I love the personal driver options that allow me to customize my seat preferences and my husband is able to do the same. the heated seats are fabulous in the cold winter months. The sound system is great...the only drawback being that the CD changer is in the trunk and to reload 6 new CD's you must go into the trunk. We have 2 children and they have plenty of room in the back seat! We have comfortably taken 3 adults in the back seat and they had lots of leg room and side space.
The Town Car handles like a dream! No matter if I am driving in the city or on the highway I am in control and feel in touch with the road. The Lincoln Town Car is a gift you give yourself and we are so pleased we took the step! <br><br>
