            I just recently purchased a 95' Cutlass Supreme, 2 door, 3.4 liter V6.  I love my new car so much that I had to write this opinion.  The 95' Cutlass Supreme is a a great car.  I used to drive a 85' Chevy Blazer and I'm so happy to get rid of it.  I bought the car for $7,700.  It has 73,000 miles, the only notable problem is that it has a couple minor leaks.  I easily looked pass that though.  The acceleration is awesome, I couldn't believe the power it showed me in the city or on the highway.  The gas mileage is a little bad for a mid-size vehicle, but that all depends on how much your pressing that gas pedal down at stop lights, and trust me it's very tempting.  The only con I can think of is that the engine is very compacted under the hood, which my mechanic said can be tough to work on, which means I'll be paying more, but that comment didn't bother  me at all.  I'm a nineteen year old guy, and I feel like I'm drivin luxury.  I was lucky to get the car with tinted windows(a must, it  looks great) leather, cd and tape the car was treated like a baby and I cam so happy to have it.  if your my age and looking for a fun, sporty, good lookin ride that's cheap, find a cutlass supreme ( but get a 2-door, your not a old man!)
