            It was love at first sight.  My friend owns a 1999 Passat and it drove like a dream.  Another friend has a Jetta and loves it.  A colleague at work owns a New Beetle.

So, when I went out to buy a pre-owned 1998 Passat with a respectable number of miles I was prepared to love the car.  Boy, was I wrong.  After only 18 months of trouble-prone ownership, I now own a Nissan Maxima.

What went wrong?

First, the car turned out to be a sports edition (or whatever they call it) and it really drove poorly.  It was very stiff and it picked up the road noise something fierce.  The car seats did not help cushion the blow, either.  VW seats have not improved much since I owned my 1978 VW Rabbit diesel with the pleather blue seats.

I had the 5-speed manual transmission and it was decent.

In only 18 months of ownership, my car was in the shop for nearly four weeks.  Difficulties like the catalytic converter dislodging from the engine block and the VW mechanics NEVER having any parts in stock (oh, I have to order that wiper blade, sir) made that darned car a menace to my pocketbook.

The interior design was a mess.  I mentioned that the seats were uncomfortable.  And I alluded to a bad design for cup holders.  On first glance, the cup holders are pretty cool.  However, they cannot hold more than one cup.  Two 12-oz cans are about it.  And even if you try to use both cup holders, the cups interfere with the stereo controls.

And the stereo.  Yipes.  This thing is nearly impossible to use when you're driving... even after owning the car for 18 months.  The controls are not well designed and it requires the driver to take his/her eyes off the road for too long.

Some cool features like auto windows that roll up and stop if they sense something (like a hand) in the way.  And the moon roof opens without having to keep your hand on the control.  And the rear seats fold down to provide decent storage space.

All-in-all, avoid this car.  It's not worth it.

I know that there's many elements to this story:  car dealer, mechanics,
