            I had a Ford Windstar and was pretty sick of it.  Everyone in the world has a green minivan and we had recently had problems with it.  So now we wanted a new car, but what? Well a friend of ours has a GMC and Buick dealership so we went to see him.  I had never liked any of the SUV's I'v seen, they just seemed like a trendy buy.  Our friend showed us the Denali for 1999 and I fell in love with it.  It handled great, it was very comfortable and could fit my three kids in it, could even fit them accross the middle seat comfortably.  The Denali is the beefed up Yukon and we didn't need all of the fancy features so we opted for the 2000 Yukon and I couldn't be any happier with it.  It drives well, is extremly comfortably and my kids aren't on top of one another.  We even got the third seat in the rear and my kids love being back there.  I would reccomend this to anyone looking for an SUV and doesn't want to have the same one everyone else has. GMC is also an excelent manufacturer and so I trust them.<br><br>
