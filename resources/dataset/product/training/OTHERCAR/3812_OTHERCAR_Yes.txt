            I was the proud owner of a new 2000 CRV.  Eight months into owning it, I was hit from behind on the highway.  The car held up like a champ, and probably saved my life.  It was fixed by Honda and seemed fine, but I knew the frame had been bent.  I had been thinking about replacing it ever since.  Then my friend showed me a catalog of the 2002 CRV.  It was love at first sight.  I went straight to the dealer to talk about it and take a test spin.  They only had one on the lot and it was sold, but they let me take it for a test drive.  The 2002 looks very different with the tinted windows, rounded hood and back end.  They kept the high mounted tail lights which I was pleased to see as they make you very easy to follow.  The car feels far more substantial.  The doors shut easily with less noise.  

Once inside, the differences are obvious to the CRV enthusiasts.  The electric moon roof is new this year and a wonderful feature.  The climate control knobs are easier to turn and very basic so you know exactly what each is for and don't have to fumble around.  The 6 CD in the dash with cassette is excellent with the 6 speakers that come standard.  I had to add the CD changer to the 2000 model and ended up with a 6 disc changer with a single disc player that came standard above it.  It was weird.  The new parking break is on the dash and I still look for it to be on the floor.  It looks cool but is still hard to find!! Both driver and passenger get arm rests that are needed for any lengthy travel in the car.  There are enough cup holders (5) to suit even the most thirsty.  The tinted glass in the rear may serve as an excellent heat deflector in the summer,but if you are not used to it, makes the cargo space very dark. 

The rear seats are much easier to fold away now that they simply roll forward.  This creates a huge cargo space to meet almost all your space needs.  However, the third head rest is awkward to see around when looking in the rear view mirror.  You do adjust to it, but it is definitely something you will notice.

The back door is one of the best improvements.  In previous models, you had to lift the glass first, then open the door.  You also had to close the door first and then the glass.  Now the door can be opened with the glass in place.  The glass can still be opened independent of the door,but it is not required to be separate.  This creates a huge opening into which most cargo will pass effortlessly.

There is so much to say about this car... The new more powerful engine is exactly what was needed.  The CRV no longer whines up hills or puts up mountains.  It now tears up the road with little effort and a lot less noise.  It feels much bigger than its predecessor although it is reportedly only 1 3/4" larger.  It has a much smoother feel when you drive it.  It is quieter as well.  The 2002 CRV feels like it is solidly on the ground.  It is easy to manuveur and has a very small turning radius.

I loved my 2000 CRV.  There are not words for how I feel about the 2002 model.  I thought it was perfect, now it truly is!! Best of all, at $22,470.00 with almost all accessories standard, it is about $1000.00 less then my 2000 CRV after adding all the accessories
