            I love this camera.  Very good deal, very nice pictures.

Given that, I've always found it easier to decide between things when I know the bad things.  The stuff that doesn't show up on the website...

1) The Website.  Fuji has an ugly, hard to use website that barely even mentions this camera.  Don't go there if you need any kind of help with the camera.

2) The Numbering System.  Occasionally, I've blown through 3 or 4 8MB cards in a day of shooting.  Copying the pics onto my hard drive, I ran into a problem... duplicate numbers.  Instead of continuing to count when I switched to a new card, it reset the counter to some other value.  This shouldn't happen.  But when it does, it's a pain to fix, and if you really want unique numbering, well, that dream is lost.

3) Macro/Flash.  I've never been able to take a non-blurry macro photo without the flash.  But with the flash on, it works great.  But the settings turn OFF the flash automatically when you switch to macro mode. Bad design choice.

4) No Lens Cover.  Interesting problem.  There is no sliding cover over the lens, just a fixed clear plastic sheet.  But it's at the highest point on the front of the camera.  So one slide across a rough surface, and you're toast.  OR SO IT LOOKS.  Maybe it's incredible scratch-proof.  But since it would ruin your camera to try, who's willing to test it?  I really think the manual should make some mention of it, but they say nothing.

5) In direct sun, it's very difficult to see the power light, or the LCD.  They just wash out complete.  And since the power switch is a toggle, and there's no difference between turning on or turning off, it can be nearly impossible to actually tell if the darn thing is even on!

Anyway, there are lots of great things about this camera, and I'm sure the other reviews will cover them.  They just miss the bad things, which are more important in my mind.<br><br>
