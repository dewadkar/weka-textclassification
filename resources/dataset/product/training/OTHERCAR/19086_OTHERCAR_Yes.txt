            First of all, I like minivans.  Specifically the Chrysler family of vans.  We traded in a 1996 Chrysler T&C LXi for a 2002 T&C LXi AWD.  With 0 percent financing and 7 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty and the desire to have a new van it was a no brainer.

When we purchased our 96 van we only looked at the Chryslers.  It was the only van at the time that had 2 sliding passenger doors.  DUH!  Why didn't anyone think of that sooner?  Well, when we went to look at new vans in 2002 we only looked at the Chrysler again.  They are the only one who offers AWD in a minivan.  The T&C line is supposed to be a luxury van.  They've only improved things since we purchased the 96 van.

Pros--Comparisons

1.  Interior Room

No other minivan has this much room.  We've been hooked on minivans for a long time.  When we had our third child we knew that we would be in a minivan for the next 15 years.  For all of you minivan haters--you're missing a great thing.  They have more room than a wagon or any SUV (including the JUMBO ones).  They may not have the coolest "image."  The ride and comfort and convenience far outweigh any perceived lifestyle faux pas.

2.  Convenience/Ergonomics  Here are the main points

Power Doors.  Up until last year Chrysler was lagging behind it's competitors by not offering power sliding doors.  I used to watch with great envy our friend's Odyssey with dual power sliders.  Chrysler responded with dual power sliding doors and a power liftgate.  Now you can open and close the doors and liftgate with a push from the remote control or from the driver's seat.  Chrysler also made the doors manual--you can open and close all doors the old fashioned way, by hand.  This is faster than the power mechanism.  It's nice to have the options.

Seats.  Chrysler does not have the "disappearing" third seat like the Honda Odyssey.  However, three kids in car seats makes the third seat a permanent fixture in our family.  Chrysler does offer a split rear bench.  You can take out half of the third row to make room for more cargo and still put a fanny in a seat.  The old bench in our 96 van was heavy but never a problem to remove.  Chrysler does offer more seating options than any other van.  Look at their website for more info.  For example, you can remove the two middle row chairs and put the rear bench in the middle--5 passenger van with a lot of cargo room.  Lots of other combinations as well.

Convenience equipment.  Most new vans offer a lot of conveniences.  The T&C is no exception; lots of cupholders all around, cubby holes, pockets, storage compartments, etc.  Chrysler does offer a removable storage unit that fits between the first two rows of seats.  It attaches to the floor but can be moved.  It has two large bins and a power socket for accessories.  They've also put hooks for plastic grocery bags in the cargo area and on the seatbacks.  No more spilled groceries.

Gizmos and Gadgets.  Kick a** stereo system with 5 cd in dash changer and wireless headphones with a remote control.  That way the kids can listen to their CD while the adults can listen to their own music.  No more listening to Barney all the way to grandma's house.  When you turn on the wireless headphones it automatically turns off the speakers in the rear.  Pretty slick.  The T&C also has cruise control and stereo buttons on the steering wheel.  The cruise control buttons are on the front spokes of the wheel.  Volume and stereo controls are on the back of the spokes.  The van includes the homelink system for garage door openers.  The HVAC system features three zones (another Chrysler exclusive)--Driver, Passenger and Rear all are independently controlled.

Engine/Transmission  3.8 liter 4 speed automatic yada, yada, yada.  We had this engine/tranny combo in our old van--very nice with no problems through 83000 miles.  I have no doubt it would have kept going for many more miles had we kept the van.  Sixteen inch wheels for a good ride.  The top of the line Limited Edition rides on 17 inchers.  Again, the main reason for us selling our old van was that we wanted All Wheel Drive.  There's no comparison between AWD and FWD or RWD even with traction control.  No one else offers this.  The saleman claims that the AWD technology comes from the Jeep division of Daimler Chrysler.  Don't know if this is true or not but it makes sense.  We also got the tow package.  With the 3.8 L engine and AWD this van should be able to tow most reasonable boats, etc.  I don't have one yet but in case I ever get one I'll be able to tow it with ease.

Cons

None really.  It was expensive but we wanted all of the bells and whistles.  The Odyssey used to be a little less expensive but Chrysler recently introduced a more economical T&C van to compete.  For top of the line you can't beat the LXi--unless you pop for two grand more and get the Limited edition.  But no other car maker makes such a nice, luxurious van.
