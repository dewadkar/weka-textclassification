            I agree with most of the reviews I've read about the focus speed and overall ease of use given the amazing level of complex settings and tools that are potential to make use of.  There are tons of settings that more advanced photographers can take advantage of, and the "dummy" mode for more point and shoot like the rest of us amateurs will be using.  

The manual zoom ring is without a doubt the greatest zoom method of any camera I've used.  It's fast and easy and super precise.  I also like the fact that it uses 2 standard AA size batteries which means you can stop at any gas station or mega-mart or anything in between to easily and quickly get back to shooting photos if your batteries happen to die.  It is very power hungry though, particularly when you use the LCD display for all your focusing, replaying lots of shots, etc.  This camera chews batteries up and spits them out in no time.  As little as 50 shots per set of batteries.  Thankfully, NIMH are getting cheaper by the day, and you can get several and keep a couple of spare sets charged and ready to go.

The bones I have to pick with this camera are mainly with it's ability to work well with low light situations, and even with normal indoor lighting.  The focus is a contrast focus so when it gets dark outside (or inside too), don't even try to use auto-focus because it won't work.  If they were to dump the outdated contrast focus for Infra-Red (IR) focus like the Sony's use, it would add a whole new level of versatility to the camera.  Or even if the existing contrast focus defaulted to infinity in low light situations, that would help tremendously, but this camera stumbles and fails miserably in the darker situations.  Now, about the normal lighting situations.  I find WAY too often that inside the house or at work, with either incandescent or florescent lighting, the pictures you take are blurry unless you use a flash.  If you shake any at all, or the subject moves any at all, you get a blur without flash because the shutter speed is way too slow.  Adding flash is almost always a requirement when shooting indoors.  

The bottom line is... if you can remember to always use the flash indoors, and you don't mind manual focus, then this camera is for you.  If you don't want that, then there are too many other cameras I've seen and used for half the price or less that will do a better job of point and shoot in any situation.  If you are an advanced amateur or above, then I would recommend this camera.  If you don't fit that category, then skip to the next camera and save a bundle in the process.
