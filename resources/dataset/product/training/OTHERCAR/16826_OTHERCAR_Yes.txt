            This is my third Camaro, so I'm kind of an old hand with them.  They're sharp, sporty cars that have a fair amount of room in this age of compact sportcars.  They do have a few flaws.  In 1994, if you get the base model you will get a 160hp engine, which is a little underpowered for a car this heavy and bulky.  If you can get a newer model, like a 1996 model for example, you will instead get a 200hp engine, which is much, much better.  Another fault that most of the older Camaros have is that the weight of the heavy doors tend to pull down on the hinges, and over the course of a few years, your door hinges will have to be replaced.  Fortunately, the newer model doors (94-and up I know for sure) are made lighter, and don't suffer from this problem.  The doors are still long though, and opening them in a tight parking spot is difficult, especially if you're a bigger person (say, 210 lbs or greater).  I have the convertible model, and although my local dealer said the tops will need to be replaced every 7-8 years, don't believe it.  Mine has been garaged since 1994, but needed a new top in 6 years.  I am finally getting around to replacing it.  Another thing that tends to break on older Camaros is the power window mechanism.  I had this trouble with 2 of my 3 Camaros.  First it was the window motor itself, and now the window has worked itself away from the door, and I will have to replace the door itself to make my window seal when it rolls up!

For sound enthusiasts, you will find a fairly standard 4-speaker system in most models (and a Bose system in some), consisting of two 6.5" back speakers and two 5.25" (unsure of this size) in the front doors.  Unfortunately, due to the design of the convertible, you will have a difficult time getting great sound quality from the convertible.  I have high quality 12" Rockford Fosgates in the trunk, and the sound is way too boomy when the top is up.  When it's down, the sound is vastly muted because the top is wedged in between the speakers in the trunk, and the passenger compartment up front.

For all my griping, it's still a decent quality sporty car.  The flaws I mention above is pretty much a complete list from my experience.  Keep your maintenance up, and it's a reliable vehicle.

Sells have been down the last few years and the Camaro is no longer being made (as of now--October 2000), but some dealers will still be trying to sell them at a premium, using every excuse they can.  Don't accept it.  You can find these cars cheap at selective places.  Good luck!

**** 12/29/2000 update ****

Since I wrote this review months ago, I've also had to replace the spark plugs (not the car's fault--they were overdue), as well as the driver-side regulator and power window motor.  The regulator is the device that keeps the window rolling up evenly.  I also had to replace the serpentyne belt, which was also due.  Basically, I've some maintenance with problems I already knew were there (the windows) and some regular maintenance, but nothing out of the ordinary.  It's holding up pretty well, and now has 105,000 miles.

115,000 miles and still going strong.  A guy ran a stop sign and hit my front end the other day, and now his insurance company is insisting we replace the plastic front with an aftermarket piece.  I'm not the happiest camper, but looks like I have to do it.  Also, I replaced the Rockford subs in the back with MTX Blue Thunder--HUGE improvement!

Mechanically, the car is still is in the same condition as it was at 105,000 miles--no new problems!
