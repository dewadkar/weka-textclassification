            I have been wanting to buy a digital camera for a long time, but didn't want to shell out a lot of money.  The main reason I got this camera is to take photos of me and my family that can be posted quickly to the internet or email.  For this, the camera is just fine.  If you are looking for high quality photos to print, this camera is not for you.

The price of this camera is what convinced me to try it.  I paid about $73 from Overstock.com using a $15 off coupon and during a promotional free shipping period.  I think that the camera is well worth this price.  The camera comes with a USB connection that is TWAIN compliant.  This connection very quickly uploads photos into any TWAIN compatible graphic software.  The camera's driver software brings up large thumbnails of the photos in the camera that lets you easily and quickly save the photos you want to your hard drive.  I also use the Video Input cable to see the photos on my TV to preview and delete any unwanted photos before uploading to the computer.  I also like the automatic flash which is helpful when taking photos indoors.  And the size of the camera itself is very compact, smaller than all the 35mm cameras I've used.

This camera takes good pictures when the conditions are right.  However, it isn't good for low light or distant objects.  There is way to manually adjust the electronic shutter speed, but I haven't tried that option to see if it helps.  The camera also needs to be held very still and there is a slight delay before the picture is taken so you can't move for a couple seconds after pressing the "take picture" button.
