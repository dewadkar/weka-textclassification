            My biggest concern when I first sought to buy a digital camera was the pixels to pennies ratio.  Most high-resolution models, price-wise, start at about $400, if that! Yeah, no prob, that's pocket change right? Well, for those of us who just like to take pictures for fun, $300 is good, but there�s that trade-off of bargain price or quality.

Well, I have to say I found my happy medium.  I bought the HP Photosmart C200 Digital Camera and its great!  It's reasonably priced at under $350 ($300 in some stores) and the picture quality is outstanding. The standard features aren't bad either. I really like such things as the adjustable flash setting, time-controlled snapshots, various picture resolutions, and a photo album or slide show viewing option.

As opposed to my usual impulse shopping-style, I'd have to say this was probably the most conscious electronics purchase I've ever made.  I actually did some research, weighed my options, and made some sensible assessments.  Most other higher-priced digital cameras in comparison to the Photosmart C200, really don�t have much of an advantage.  Sure, you�ll get more bells and whistles, but not much else.  Personally, I couldn�t find any justification in paying 200 to 300 dollars more for a few extra buttons.  My concern focused more toward �how good would the picture be.�  Well at 1152 x 872-picture resolution and 24-bit color,  I can certainly say I�m one satisfied customer.

Some small tidbits about the camera that  I�ve come to appreciate are; <b>1)</b> The extended battery life - without the use of the LCD screen, the battery life is quite long; <b>2)</b> Interchangeable storage card - comes standard with a 8MB Compact Flash disk (also available in 15 and 40MB).  At the lowest resolution the disk will store 80 pics and at it�s highest, 20 pics; <b>3)</b> LCD controls � the on-screen display lets you sort, edit, and delete stored photos; <b>4)</b> Look and Feel � it handles like a regular camera and doesn�t feel flimsy like others I�ve used. 

All in all, it�s a well-rounded camera, but there are a couple of downsides.  Well, for instance, there is a zoom feature. Not a big zoom, but a zoom.  The camera supports up to 2X zoom; all I can say is don�t expect much. Another hang-up, which is not so big a deal for myself, but may be for some is the slow downloads from the camera (it uses a serial cable, what can you say?).

<b>Packaged Software:</b>
The package also includes, Microsoft's <b>Picture It</b> software.  A nice tool for anyone just wanting a few font or color additions, just don't expect any Adobe Photoshop miracles.

<b>Overall:</b>
This is undoubtedly the Best camera for your dollar. That is unless your dollars come in multiples of a thousand, in which case, my review doesn't really matter!
