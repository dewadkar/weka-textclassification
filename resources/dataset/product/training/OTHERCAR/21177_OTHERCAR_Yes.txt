            My brother has a 1996 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab Z-71.  It is hunter green on the top and tan at the bottom.  There is tan leather interior inside.  The seats are great.  They are very comfortable.  My dad's 1993 GMC Sierra does not have this much comfort in the seats, I guess because they are cloth.  (There is a review also on the 1993 Sierra)  

This truck is great.  It has cruise control, tilt, a tape player and a cd player, he also put a cd changer in under the back seat.  It is short wheel based.  But it is still long from the extended cab.

The only thing bad about it is the gas mileage.  It gets very very low mileage, 10 - 15 miles a gallon.  It has a big gas tank because of that.  It holds about 30 gallons of gas, and it knows how to drink the gas too!  So I guess that would be a con.  That is the only one though!! 

My brother has a full grown chocolate lab named Hershey.  She goes everywhere with him.  She enjoys being in the cab too.  There is enough room for her to lay down in the passenger seat along beside my brother while he is driving.

The front bucket seats are very comfortable. It  has heated seats, lumbar support, and a lot  of other stuff.   The driving is great.  It handles like a car.  It is four wheel drive.  This is great in the snow.  I am from Tennessee, and we LOVE to go muddin'!!  

The air conditioner and heater are great.  You can feel like you are in Alaska in the summer and be in Hawaii in the winter.  There are power windows and door locks.  There is also a remote control to lock and unlock the doors and the panic button.

My brother's Chevrolet Silverado Z-71 is great.  I love it!!  You can usually find one on just about any car lot.  I think Chevy made a lot of them.  I see them quite often.  This is a very nice truck.  It is very easy to load to move stuff with also.  When he moved from his house to an apartment in another town, he used the truck.  It hauled everything, including his queen sized bed and dressers.  There is plenty of storage and hauling space in the bed of the truck.

Leave me comments on what you think about my review!!

Thank you for reading and have a good night!!
