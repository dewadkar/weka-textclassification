            I currently own a 1991 BMW 318is, and I have put 145,000 miles on it.  There have been no problems with the car.  The only service I have had to perform is the routine maintenence that need be done (brakes, tires, oil changes, service inspections, etc.)  I had to replace a water pump and a radiator, also.  The car gets excellent gas mileage (24 city, 31-33 highway) and performs incredibly for a 4 cylinder car.  Believe it or not, I have outdone GT Mustangs with this car.  This car is a wonderful example of German engineering, with all routine maintenence easy to do.  For those wanting a Bimmer, I suggest this one. 

One more thing, make sure you take your car to a mechanic that you can trust, and don't ever take it to &quot;Just Brakes&quot; or &quot;Quickie Lube&quot; to have any services done.
