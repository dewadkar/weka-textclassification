            Just imagine your wife, sister or loved one driving this vehicle down your suburbs.  Just think about all the double takes by the neighbors who pass her.  Actually, they have more than one reasons to look at your wife, sister or loved one.  They are driving a GMC Jimmy 2000.  From far away, these onlookers spotted the shining metal of the pure SUV style Jimmy.  They wanted to take a look at this hot vehicle.  Most of us find ourselves give a second at a well-designed vehicle on the road.  Two co-workers of mine are the proud owners of Jimmys.  I got the opportunity to see what's so hot about them.

It was lunch time.  Our stomachs were churning.  We could hear the loud rumble.  I hopped into her new Jimmy (She traded in her 1997 for the 2000 one) and we were heading down freeway 99 to a small cafe at a well-known local spot.  The mexican restaurant we were heading to could be packed if we get there after 12:15.  So my friend wanted to give me a show of her SUV's engine performance.  We are talking here about 190 horse power engine.  It was quite a difference considering that I am a regular SUV, the rough ride kind of owner.  My friend rolled down the windows so we could bathe in the California's sun.  I gave her a few hints to pull the power sunroof.  For sure, I made her or asked her to let me drive it on the way back to work.

Now I just want to share with you the results of my experience with her drive.

This Jimmy can consume about 18 miles per gallon.  It has power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, and a huge sound system (Bose Sound System) that most teenagers will fight for...(Beware, parents!).  What else does this baby have?  It is well-equipped with automatic climate control, 8 power leather seats and much more.

If you are on the market for a new vehicle that conveys class and achievement, security and relatively strong presence on the road, then GMC Jimmy is for you.  Just for you!  You can decide to have some extras thrown into the package too.  You can get heated outside mirrors, self-dimming rear view and outside left mirrors, and compass.

Now get ready to visit some hot destinations or the national parks you never had a chance to visit.  Head to Las Vegas, Reno, Yosemite etc.  You are in a comfortable and reliable SUV!<br><br>
