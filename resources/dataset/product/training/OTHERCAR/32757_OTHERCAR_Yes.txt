            One day when my fiance came home from work he was telling me about this nice 93 camera he had looked at on his way home from work. It was a used car but he had told me it looked brand new and nothing was wrong with it so the next day we went to go look at it and take it for a test drive. I could not help but to like this car so much. It was a very fast car and it was a nice looking camaro to be a used car. So, as you should know we bought the car for six thousand ( since it was a used car and a older model we got it for a lower price than it would sell on the market ) and we took it home to mess around with and to check everything out. 


I like this car a lot because it is a sport car and the color of it is red even though a lot of sport cars are red I think red is a wonderful color for a sport car. The car we bought is a stick shift and it is a six speed and will go up to 160 MPH. That is something I do not like about it is that it is a very fast car. I do not like fast cars to much because you can get out of hand with a fast car and run into something but my fiance really like's fast vehicle's, so that is another reason why I think he picked this car out. I like the car a lot just not the speed.

Riding in the Camaro is such a soft and smooth ride. When you hit a bump or something like that you can not really tell that you hit one. It just goes right over the bump as smooth as it can go over it. The interior of the car is a light gray and a dark gray color. The seat's are very comfortable. I have sat in a lot of car's but nothing is as comfortable as these seat's. 

I think if you are a sport's car person you should go look at this car and check it out. It is a very nice car and the most comfortable I can say I have ever sat in. They come in hard top, convertible top, and a T- top. Whatever one you want I am sure you can get. I am also sure you can get them in any color you would like. We really did not have a lot of color's to pick from since it was a used car but red is fine with me. I think it is a nice color for a Camaro sport's car. 


Ever since we have had the car nothing has went wrong with it. I can actually say that this is the first car we have had that nothing has went wrong with it. Every other care we have bought something was wrong with or something went wrong with it shortly after we bought it.  

Well, I am pleased with this Camaro and I think if you bought one you would be also. It is a nice car and a great quality one at that. So, if you are looking for a great sport's car then give this one a try!
