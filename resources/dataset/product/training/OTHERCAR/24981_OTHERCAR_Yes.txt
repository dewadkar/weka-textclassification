            Seven months and 7,000 miles into my lease of this black Jeep Liberty 2003 Limited Edition and I'm very pleased so far with the decision to get it.

I had originally gone to the dealership to look for a Sebring convertible, but when I saw the Libertys in the next row over, like a kid, I said to my sales guy "I wanna drive THAT one".   He let me, and two days later, I drove it off the lot for good.   Between that time, I went to the web to do a lot of research, comparing it to its competition and found that it was among the best.   Low gas mileage was the only major reported flaw, but since my daily commute is only 5 miles, not a big deal for me.

Here is a list of reasons why I like it, which may not match with your likes/dislikes, but here goes.  

1)  It looks sporty and sharp.  
2)  The Limited Edition comes with tinted windows and power everything, keyless remote, etc.   Little things, I know, but they add up and make for lots of convenience.
3)  High profile.   After being a pickup truck owner for 9 years, I've gotten used to seeing above everyone else on the freeway.  The Liberty gives me that.
4)  Decent amount of storage area.  The back seats fold down almost flat in a clever 1/3-2/3 fashion for hauling stuff AND riding one person in the back.
5)  Real tight turning radius.  A U-turn on a standard residential street is easy.
6)  Great acceleration.  Solid and strong braking.
7)  No comment on the 4-wheel drive; I only have the 2.

Room for improvement:

1)  Could use more length in order to haul more stuff, maybe a foot or two, because it's a short stubby truck.   If you want to make a home improvement run and then carry something that's 8 feet long, you need to tie it on top.  Items 6 feet long will fit diagonally if they are no more than a foot or so wide.

2)  I wish the gas mileage was better; at least 21 or 22.  I actually get around 15-17.  Maybe I'm being unrealistic with the V6 3.7 though.

3)  I wish the seats, especially the drivers seat, were about an inch or two longer in the thigh.  I'm 5'11" with a 32" inseam and these seats come up a bit too short.  On longer trips (200 miles or so) I seem to need to reposition myself about once every 10 minutes.  But then, this is a Jeep after all, and asking for exceptional comfort on long cruises is perhaps a bit outside of its scope.
