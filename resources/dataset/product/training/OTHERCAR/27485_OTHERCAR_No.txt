            I just bought a used Mitsubishi Mirage 96 about a year ago, and at first... as with any car... I was pretty excited with it.  It handles really good, tight steering, sensitive breaks, pretty good gas mileage.. but the one thing this car really lacked is pickup.  No matter where I am, or what kind of cars are around me... if I'm waiting at a stop light, and it turns green... everyone goes and cuts in front of me.  Why?  Because the pickup is so slow on this car!!  Now, I'm a college student so I try to conserve as much gas as I could to save money.. so I can't go flooring it every time that light turns green...

Speaking of gas, the one thing I really like about this tiny car is that I can get a full tank of gas for about $10 when the gas prices are fairly high.  Back in the day when gas was under a dollar, I had a full tank in about 6-7 bucks, and that was great :)  I get about 230-250 miles on a full tank.

The ride is nice and smooth, and it starts up like a charm no matter what the weather is like.  I used to have a Mercury Cougar.. and over the winter, I'd be out there for about half an hour trying to get that baby to start, but it just wouldn't!  This winter, with the Mirage... I didn't have any problems at all.  Each time, no matter what the whether was like (I live in Chicago) ... the car started just as if it was an 80 degree summer day.  That's a definate plus.  The air conditioner and heater work very quickly, so thats also good for those warm or cold days.

Overall I guess it's a pretty nice car.. but I think I'd see more Grandma's driving it than anyone else :)  <br><br>
