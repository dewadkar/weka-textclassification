            To start off, this is not a camera for serious photographers; this is a great tech-geek toy with mainstream crossover potential.  (In English, it looks cool, and it&#146s easy to use.)  If you take this out on the street, heads will turn.  People will come ask you what it is.  It looks awesome.  Your dog will respect you more.  You may be promoted.  It&#146s that cool.  And realistically, they can&#146t make them much smaller, or there won&#146t be anything to hold on to, so you&#146ve reached coolness nirvana.  With sound.

This is not to say it doesn&#146t take good pictures; I&#146ve been fairly pleased with the output.  Some of the other reviews can address the technical specs and such, as I don&#146t know a whole lot about them.  But on the whole, the pictures I&#146ve taken are uniformly better than the pictures I&#146ve taken with old fashioned 35mm cameras.  I bought the camera purely as a point and click device and it works great.  What sold me on this model was the size and 30 second videos with sounds, and I&#146ve been real happy with the output there.

Some of the cool stuff:  The menus are easy to figure out.  Configuring the settings takes a little getting used to and a bit of tweaking, but you can generally get pictures you like without too much effort.  The movies are pretty cool.  And the picture on the viewscreen is excellent.  It&#146s a 1.6&#148 screen, which is generally enough to frame the pictures you want.  But to reiterate, the coolest thing about this thing is the size.  It&#146s comes about a millimeter short of fitting inside an Altoids tin, and it&#146s thinner.

Some of the downsides:  First off, cost.  Not just the unit, which is pricey on its own, but the dang memory cards.  I&#146m sure these will come down over time, but for right now, the SecureDisk cards it needs are expensive.  One of the consequences of this is that you won&#146t want to use the MP3 player functionality much because you&#146ll want the space for high quality pictures.

As for storage space, with the high quality pics I like, you can get about 160 or so on a 128 MB card.  The lowest quality/size combo here will fit about 1500  in the same space.  (There are three different sizes, 1600x1200, 1280 x 960 and 640x480, and three qualities, Fine, Normal and Economy.)
If you&#146re cheap, you can get by for a while on the native 12MB memory, which is also pretty cool.

Oh, and did I mention it&#146s an MP3 player?  While this is kinda cool on paper, and while showing it off, I haven&#146t used this yet, and don&#146t expect to, unless the cards become free.  It does come with a nice remote for the mp3 functionality, with readout and all, but it seems a bit tacked on.  It&#146s almost like this is just too much.

While the pictures are great straight on, once you start using the zoom, they get pretty fuzzy.  It goes to 4x digital zoom, and the picture starts to degrade fairly quickly.
I&#146m also constantly afraid I&#146m going to lose it.  I lose my keys all the time, and they&#146re way bigger than this is!  

As for the movies, I&#146ve been pretty impressed, but the size is limiting.  While 30 seconds is generally long enough to get what I want, the maximum size is 320x240.  That&#146s just pretty tiny.  Still, quality is ok.

The software that ships with the camera is ok.  The Photo Loader is a convenient archive, but the Photo Editor is a waste.  The cradle is nice and small though, and it has USB connectivity, so I can plug it straight into my keyboard.  Nice feature.

I&#146ve been VERY pleased with the battery life.  If you&#146re fairly conservative (i.e. turning it off after you take a picture) you can go a few weeks without a charge.

And that about sums it up.  There are a lot of features here I didn&#146t cover.  Some are things I don&#146t use (like the ability to take audio notes, or annotate photos with sounds), some are things I just don&#146t have comments on (like the Best Shot feature, which sets up the camera for certain shots automatically.)  On the whole, this camera is an excellent purchase.  I&#146m glad I got it.  It defines portability, and now I have a camera with me everywhere I go.

If you&#146ve got the cash for it, and are just looking for some point and click fun, this is for you.
