            Normally I prepare photos for the web by shooting them in 35mm and then scanning the prints or slides. This gives me excellent control over quality and resolution, but it's not the fastest way to proceed. I wanted a digital camera for quick web page updates, and for sending images of non-scannable materials via e-mail as well. Quality wasn't the first consideration; convenience and cost was.

I bought the Smile as it appeared, at the time, to be the best value in a low end camera. At the time it retailed for about $125, and could be had for $109 if you shopped around. The only competitors at the time were units from unknown makers and the Barbie camera. I went with the Smile thinking Agfa's support would be a plus.

The camera itself is reasonably easy to use, resolution is an acceptable 640x320, and Agfa's support software is fairly intuitive, and offers some nice image processing and editing features, but beyond that, the camera has been a major disappointment.

The biggest problem has been battery life. The Smile eats batteries at an astounding rate, especially if you use flash. I have more than once found a set of batteries exhausted after taking fewer than 10 pictures- pretty awful for a camera than is supposed to hold 12 images. The lens is a pinhole affair that restricts decent images to bright sunlit days, unless the flash is used, and as 640x320 images go, the images captured by the Smile lack the contrast and detail of other cameras with similar resolution.

In summary, then, the Smile turned out to to be a bargain at all. With the falling prices and increasing quality of other digital cameras, the Smile is a poor choice even at its new lower price.<br><br>
