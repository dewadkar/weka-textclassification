                  I had never owned a digital camera in my life, so I decided to try one out and experiment with one and see if I could handle it.  Of course, there is no film, but I think I already knew that, however, I was extremely surprised by the quality of the pictures taken!  I worked quite well with my digital camera, despite it being complicated and quite hard to handle at times.

      I decided to purchase the Kodak Digital Science DC260 Zoom Camera.  A good friend of mine had highly recommended it to me.  And I have not yet regretted purchasing my digital camera.  There are so many cool features, my favorite being able to transfer the pictures to my computer.  That was quite exciting for me to do and see the picture that I had taken just five minutes ago on my computer screen smiling right back at me!

      Located right below the display screen on the camera are three &quot;softkey&quot; buttons, where you can change many functions.  I thought it was fun to play around with those buttons and mess around with my picture.  Also located there is a mode dial with four modes.

 - Capture: This mode is the main mode where you are taking your wonderful pictures.  I really enjoy how you it's like a &quot;moving screen&quot; like a video camera.  Just playing around with that is a lot of fun.

 - Review: In this mode you can look over all your pictures. I extremely appreciate this mode because sometimes I end up taking a picture I regret for many different reasons, and you don't find out until you have gotten your film developed.  On this camera you can look at your picture right after you have taken it, and if you don't like the picture, you can just delete right in front of your eyes.  That can save you trouble and money!

 - Connect: I briefly touched on this mode earlier.  This mode is where you can connect your camera to your computer.  A few easy steps and you can see your picture on your screen and send it to many people.  That is pretty neat!

 -Info: This is the last mode where you can see the display of information about your camera's firmware.  That could come in handy.

I would highly recommend this camera to everybody.  Especially to those who have children.  What a better way to capture a &quot;Kodak Moment!&quot; Everyone should give this camera a try!<br><br>
