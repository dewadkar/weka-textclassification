            I've always been a Toyota Corolla owner but wanted something a little bit roomier.  When I tried the 2000 Camry I fell in love.  I wished that I had tried this vehicle a long time ago.  The seats are comfortable and the ride is smooth.  Being short one of the features that appealed to me was the electric drivers seat.  It had been a long time since I had been able to see over the windshield wipers without a pillow.  If you looking for comfort this is definitely the car to buy.  It has a very roomy trunk which is great for a long trip.  It also has a comfortable back seat with plenty of leg room.  I've also received a lot of compliments on the appearance and style.  <br><br>
