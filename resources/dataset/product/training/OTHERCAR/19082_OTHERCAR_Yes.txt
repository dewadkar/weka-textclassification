The price remains unchanged from 1997, while adding several improvements.

More improvements include interior profile ignition key and optional remote locking with new folding key. The exterior color Santorin Blue replaces Europa Blue. The 1998 Cabriolet is not available for sale in California, New York, Massachusetts or Connecticut due to emission regulations.
