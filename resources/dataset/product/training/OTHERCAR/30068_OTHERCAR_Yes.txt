            Well, after months and months of looking at digital cameras, I finally bought one.  I decided upon the Kodak DC280, but only after reading dozens of opinions not only here at epinions.com, but with other people as well.  I have yet to find anything to regret about my decision.  Now, maybe I'm not as picky or as techno-minded or concerned about " bells and whistles" , but this camera is absolutely great at the bottom line for what all cameras should be judged upon....taking great pictures! They are crisp, clear, and give wonderful renditions of natural color.  I have a lot of 35mm camera equipment and have been taking photos for 30 years, and I find it hard to tell the difference between the shots from the Kodak DC280 and my 35mm. Obviously, you need a good high end printer to get the results you see when I put them on the computer screen, but given that, I get great pics every time.  

Since I have had the camera, I have come back to epinions.com to read some of the negative reviews others have written, but I have yet to experience any of the things they describe.  I did buy a card reader...a San Disk for $29.95 at CompUSA...to go along with the camera.  With a card reader you never need to attach your camera to your computer to download your pics.  You just slip the card out of the camera and slip it into the reader, go to My Computer on your desk top, click on the reader icon, and poof, there's your pictures.  I have no idea why anyone would want to go through the process of connecting their digital camera with a cable and using up battery strength by having to have your camera powered up during the download process. A card reader for thirty bucks is soooooo easy!  

Others have mentioned the LED display being in the wrong area and getting smudged all the time.  Heck, use your other eye and that won't happpen.  I can't imagine where any digital camera would have there display that would prevent occasional smudging.  Get over it....use a soft cloth and wipe it clean!

The DC280 comes with a set of rechargeable batteries and gives plenty of power to take LOTS of shots....and using the highest resolution as well.  This camera is easy to use and gives me all the options I need. It also comes with a an 8 meg card.  I went to Costco and got myself a 64 meg card for $104 and now I have all the picture storage capacity I could ever want.  With the camera set at the highest resolution I can get 102 pics with the 64 meg card.  That's a lot of pictures!  

Other than not having the integrated lens cap, I am absolutely delighted with this camear.  I just can't see where anyone can go wrong.
