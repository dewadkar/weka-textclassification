            My mother is loaning me her 1998 Sunfire.  When I first saw the car, I was excited!  The car is sporty looking, has a purple exterior, a snazzy spoiler, and a sunroof.  Once you get past the beautiful exterior, there is nothing else to the car.  It is a four cylinder.  WOW!  The car idles like crazy.  The heater takes twice as long to heat up, as compared to anything else I have ever driven.  It is NOT a car designed for snow, by any means!  My ten-year-old Walkman is louder than the stereo system.  And the horn sounds like a clown car.  But I shouldn't complain...it beats walking.  Or does it?<br><br>
