            Gotta tell you, when I first saw the commercials way back when, I thought &quot;How cheesy! All these people that are in love with their car!&quot; Well, these days, I am the big dork that wants to be in a Saturn commercial, featuring my second home, my navy blue SL2! 

It is super roomy, in front and back, and has tons of little &quot;cubbies&quot; to store my junk (like in the door panels, the console, behind the front seats, etc. My son is still an infant, so his big old carseat takes up a ton of space, but in my Saturn, there is still plenty of room. 

Recently, I lost control of a milkshake I was sipping on (chocolate), and it was all over the seat. I freaked at first, because I had not opted for the &quot;stain repel&quot;, but I shouldn't have worried. Just a little scrubbing, and the well dried milkshake stains were gone completely. Gotta love that, if you're a mommy with a messy little one!

The car handles wonderfully, and those dent resistant panels are superfly!
