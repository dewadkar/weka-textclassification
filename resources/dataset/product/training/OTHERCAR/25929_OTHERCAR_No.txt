            This car is nice but it doesn't have it all. I like driving it, but for some reason it just doesn't impress me. It has pretty decent pickup, but actually my '92 Buick Regal is very comparable in this category. I expected more from the Grand Am. Ok, actually the Grand Am isn't mine it's my parents car, but I've driven it enough now to give a good opinion. 

I was disappointed when my mom chose this car over the Grand Prix. She picked the Grand Am because of the color it came in. (Grand Prix's don't come in green) I think that the Grand Prix is a much nicer car. (and the lease was only $20 more a month) I'm a big person and I have trouble finding comfort in cars. Even with the seat back all the way in the Grand Am, my knees are bent. I'm only 6'3&quot;. It's not like I look Shaq in the eye or anything. Can't any car designers make something to fit me?? My next purchase will probably be an SUV just because of this. The Grand Prix gave me a little more room, but not much. It actually has a nice big back seat and a bigger trunk than the Grand Am. 

This car does look sharp on the outside, but I've never been one of those people to care about that. One good thing about that for me is that I like the interior of this car. One thing I don't like is the fact that the interior lights come on themselves when it gets darker. This may seem like a nice feature but when it gets to be close to getting dark, it's like the car can't make up it's mind. Some days it will go on and some days it won't. 

As I said, this car wasn't ergonomically designed for a taller person. My knees must stay bent and the center console is too low for me to rest my knee there so I end up resting it on the shifter. Yeah, that's comfortable! On the other side, the door handle arrangement is too high for me to rest my knee on (or should I say not high enough). The very top of my knee touches the very bottom of the door handle arrangement. It has a nice little niche right under the CD player, but you can really only get to it if the car is in drive. Oh and another thing, the factory windshield wipers it comes with are junk. We had to get a different brand right away. 

Would I recommend this car to someone?  Not really. It's nice looking and that's about it. I'm not trying to be sexist my this next comment but in my experience women are the ones who like this car. And most of the women I know who like the car are the ones who buy cars because they think the car is &quot;cute&quot;. There's more to it than that obviously. But some women don't care, like my mom. My recommendation is to go with the Grand Prix. It's more roomier, just as affordable, and has a better engine.

I also have to complain about the service we get with it. But that has to do with our dealer. It's been a very reliable car. It has a very good air conditioner and heater. No problems with it so far. Except for when I was hit and run in it.  <br><br>
