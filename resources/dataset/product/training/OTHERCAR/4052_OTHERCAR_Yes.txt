              I recently bought this palmcam from buy.com.  I was looking for an average camera (megapixel ability) at a reasonable price.  And after extensive searching I came across this palmcam.  It was 300 dollars which was a great price considering what this camera could do.  

  With 1.3 megapixel resolution I was happy with the fact that it could take sharp pictures.  What sold me on paying 300 of my hard earned cash on this gadget was that it also came with a 3x zoom.  It has dual slots so that you can upgrade the memory size with two cheaper eight megs rather than having to buy a 16.  (If you've ever seen the prices on compact flash you'll know what I mean).  Also you can buy a modem for this camera which goes into the second slot.  Quite convenient huh!  It could create a four second film (which I doubt I'll ever use but nice to know that I can)and it was pretty.  Yes i know that sounds really shallow but the other cameras (ie kodak's) were great cameras that just looked like a toy.  This palmcam looked like a normal 35 mm camera and has that feel to it as well.  It also came with adobe software which I know is always good, but I think that a good copy of photoshop is the best.  

  Now this is my first digital camera so please bear in mind that this might not be the best person to review it, but I like it.  You can get a nice clean shot with even the normal picture quality.  These pictures would most likely only be used for website or what not that you don't really want to take too much time to download when viewing the page.  The superfine quality is very nice and would be used for printing out the pictures.  Of course the time it takes to download the images from your camera takes longer because of the good picture quality.  And your camera has to be on while the computer downloads so your battery life is being drained.  So an adapter would be a good thing to have, or if you're like me, just take the normal resolution images.  I mean how many of these pictures are you really going to print?  

  Once I got this camera there really weren't too many things to take pictures of (really think about how often you use your 35mm and you'll know what I mean) so I just went camera happy and took images of various things around the house.  Once you're not paying to develop the film who cares what you take pictures of.  What I ended up doing was taking outdoor pictures.  This turned out really well, when I took an image of a forest area where there are many leaves and very delicate areas of greenery it turned out perfect.  

  One caution, this camera cannot take action shots.  This means any type of moving.  If you are a person with a shaky hand this camera is not for you.  My first image was of my stuffed animal turtle and because it was a close up (using that zoom of mine) all the blurs were easily seen.  But once you get the hang of it the images come out great!  Oh, also there seems to be a slight problem with indoor shots.  There's something iffy with the flash.  But the images still seemed ok.  Make sure that the lighting is right (which is something you should be doing with your 35mm anyway) and you'll get great images.  Also the shutter speed is rather slow so again bad for action shots.  

  I bought a couple of NIMH rechargable batteries as well as a case for it.  Like most digital cameras they suck the lives out of the poor poor alkalines.  

  Final thoughts: considering what I paid for this camera I'm very satisfied.  If I had to pay the full 400+ or as epinions states 490, then I perhaps wouldn't be as happy.  If you want to spend around three hundred or less on a camera and can't find a good deal then I suggest an olympus.  They have good well made cameras and offer good prices.

these are great places for reviews by people that have bought the products and used them as well as professional reviews by the two companies.  

  That's all I can think of for now.  Thanks for reading.<br><br>
