            Hey, I'm Mike, I'm 15 years old, and i just bought my very own 2001 Acura 3.2 CL.  People who want a mid-priced coupe usually look at the CL and BMW's entry-level 3-series.  Both cars are similar in quality, or so people say.  But in my opinion, after looking at the base price of the Acura ($28,000), and then at the 328Ci (almost $38,000) with options that come standard in the acura included in the price, there should be no comparison between the two cars.  However, I see so many more 3s out on the road than CLs.  I scratched my head and thought....

My theory for this is summed up in two reasons.  The first has to do with Acura's history.  When Acura was launched in 1986, it was supposed to grab the luxury car buyer's attention (of course, those who couldn't afford a $100k Mercedes).  But then Lexus came out with their LS 400 in 1990, which competed with the Infiniti Q45...and the Acura RL, while still a nice basic luxury car, couldn't stand up to Lexus competition.  At this point, some people considered it &quot;The death of Acura'.  Sadly, it was true.  Acura needed to be revitalized as an important car company with reliable, affordable, and luxurious automobiles.  

Enter the Acura TL, a car that sold #1 in its class of 4-door near-luxury cars.  But Acura still needed a bigger boost, and after the ever-popular Legend had been discontinued, it looked like the end of Acura for good.

When Acura came out with its longer, upscaled 3.2CL in early March of 2000, it looked like Acura was finally about to be lifted from the jaws of defeat.  Everything about this car was of excellent quality, which really got me wondering how Acura could make the interior of the CL so luxurious and with so many amenities for a base price of less than $28,000.  It donned on me that the reason the price was so low for such a great interior is that the wood, which they give you a lot of, is not real.  They call it &quot;wood grain&quot;, which is just a nice way of saying it's phony baloney.  In my parchment interior, which comes with a brown wood grain, people can't tell that its fake, but i would like to see someone get in a CL with black interior and look at the &quot;wood grain&quot;, which is a mixture of black and grey.  They'll probably scratch their head themselves and wonder what kind of &quot;wood&quot; that is.  To me, the black wood is nice to look at...if you live on Mars.  You'll see what i mean if you ever look at it.

Ahem!  Back to my theory.  Acura themselves believed the CL would resurrect sales for their company.  Alas, its not, the reason being that after Acura &quot;died&quot; when Lexus came out, people have been having a hard time recognizing them as a good car company.  This also explains why, when someone buys any Acura (except an Integra), they get so many things with the car.  I'm not talking about CD players or sunroofs, I'm talking about numbers you can call.  For instance, every acura buyer has access to a Concierge service, to recommend hotels and restaurants and anything else, while on a long road trip.  They equip you with roadside assistance from here to the moon, so if, god forbid, you're ever in Iceland and your acura breaks down in some pasture, the nearest Acura dealer will come to your rescue in about 3 hours.  I could go on and on.  But the point is that before people start to recognize Acura as competition for Lexus, Infinti, and BMW, people will most likely opt for a car from those 3 car companies which i have just mentioned.

The second reason I see so many 3s on the road instead of CLs stems from BMW's &quot;cult&quot; following.  When people own a BMW, the buyer is automatically shut off to anything else, and most likely, they will buy another BMW in 7 years or so.  This is not the case to this degree with any other car company but BMW.  So people with BMWs will not consider anything else, and certainly not an Acura.

What a shame.  If they knew what they got for their money if they were to buy a CL, they would kick themselves.  I really hope more people buy CLs, so they can see what owning an Acura has to offer.  

If you have any questions, or if you are a CL owner or a 3-series owner, please e-mail me at Silver462@aol.com.  Thanx,

-Mike
