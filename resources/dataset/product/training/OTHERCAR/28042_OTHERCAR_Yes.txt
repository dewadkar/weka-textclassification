            OK, I have a Neon Highline with just over 24,000 miles, Automatic, Air, etc. I have not noticed any of the problems posted in other reviews. I bought my Neon used at around 19,000 miles. Love It! I have noticed excessive brake dust on the front wheels but have not experienced any reduction in braking. It idles a little rough at times, need to change the plugs at around 30,000 which should help. Another suggestion which helps is to replace your stock Air Filter as soon as possible and replace it with a K&N Air Filter (Part Number E-1006) This greatly improves power and fuel economy in the Neon. On fuel economy, I average 31 mpg and my daily commute is a 50/50 ratio of city/highway with heavy traffic most of the time. I only use Texaco regular unleaded, which runs best in my car. (Actual test may very) I have always wondered if I could use that phrase in a sentence! :) Anyway, I would recommend the 2nd generation Neon to anyone looking for a good, practical, economical compact car. Lots of room inside. Not so good on setup if you smoke, the optional ashtray fits in any cupholder, but none of the cupholders are in a good location for an ashtray. Will be taking my Neon on a road trip from Oregon to Arkansas next month, will keep you all posted on performance on long trips! I would welcome any questions or comments regarding the Neon, hope this review helps!
