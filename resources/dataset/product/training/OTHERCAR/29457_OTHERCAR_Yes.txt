            Our family bought a Jeep Wrangler in 1999 as a vehicle for our son to drive when he started driving.  Now, we like it so much that we are not so sure we want to give it up.
We all enjoy the sporty, casual drive the jeep gives, especially with the ragtop off.  It allows us to get a tan and cool off in the summer breeze.
The jeep is great for short trips; we haven't tried it in a long trip yet.  It doesn't give as smooth of a drive as some other vehicles we have owned.  The back seats are not generous with room, but that to be expected with any sporty, small-sized vehicle.
We kept looking until we found one with all the assessories we wanted:
driver and passenger windows of glass, ragtop, automatic, air-conditioned, CD player, and large treaded tires.
Probably any age would enjoy a Jeep Wrangler.  My elderly mother can get into our jeep easier than into a truck or an SUV.  If you don't have the time for the ragtop you can buy a hardtop that comes off easily.  We are considering buying one, in addition, to use on occasions for more security.
