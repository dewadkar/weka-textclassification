            I bought my Shadow America in '93.  It only had 50 miles on it.  It now has 153,000 miles on it and up until last year was very dependable.  
The Shadow America is a very basic model.  I have the hatchback model with a 2.2L 4-cyl engine connected to a 5-speed manual transmission.  The only real option I have in it is a rear defroster which operates on a timer.  The other cars in this model year and class just have a switch to turn it on or off.  

Interior:  The front seats are comfortable for short periods but have plenty of legroom. (I am 5'11")  The back seats are hard to get in and out of.  They are also a bit stiff.  The legroom in the back is uncomfortable for anyone over the age of 10.  The back seat folds down which offers a very large cargo area.  The dash has held together very well.  When I wipe it down it looks almost new.  That's after several years in the Texas sun!  The fabric came down completely after 8 years.  The only other concern I would have about this car is if it were in an accident.  Mine has been rear ended twice.  This lead to the front seat back breaking apart.  If you are not careful, you will end up lying on your back while driving.  

Exterior/Body:  I had major cosmetic problems here!  The paint that was applied to my car was the experimental mix that Dodge tried that year.  They tried to save time painting their cars by mixing the primer and the paint together and spraying it on.  Most cars are primed and painted separately.  The color was Raspberry Metallic.  While this was a nice color, it didn't last very long.  After 6 years, the paint started fading down to the metal.  I began getting surface rust on the roof.  The paint on the top side surfaces faded to white while on the sides it held it's color.  My red car was turning white!

Engine/Transmission:  The head gasket blew after 8 years of dependable service.  It broke between the cylinders so the only sign of damage was the fact I was burning antifreeze.  The head sustained no damage and the engine has run fine since the repair although it is rather noisy.  The transmission itself works, however, the linkage between the gear shift and transmission contains a design flaw.  I spoke with the dealer about this and it's a common problem.  The linkage will come apart and you must get the cable replaced.  When the linkage comes apart you will be stuck in whatever gear it was in when this happened.  One way to check for this is to shift into first gear, if it's difficult, you need to replace the cable.  

Knowing this, if I were to look at a '92 Dodge Shadow now I would say "If you know the service history, you should be ok.  If you don't, avoid it."
