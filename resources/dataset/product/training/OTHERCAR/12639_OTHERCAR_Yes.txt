            My firm handles a lot of probate cases.  We frequently get items that cannot be easily sold.  We needed a camera that was easy to use, portable, took good, clear pictures, had an ability to use multiple storage units, was easy to download and finally, and very importantly, had software that made the picture easy to manipulate once the images were downloaded.  The Canon Power Shot S10 met all of these requirements.  It is far less bulky than many similar camera, though heavy for its size.  I like that it has both a view screen and a peep sight.  Sometimes it is too hard to line a shot up with just a view screen; especially in low light situations.  The USB connection is a breeze to use and the software is simple also.  The pictures are clear and crisp and print very well.  (We use an Hewlett-Packard Desk Jet 932C printer)  Although not really a drawback, this camera has so many features that I must keep the instructions hand to use some of the more esoteric ones.  My only real gripe is the severe power drain during use, and the difficulty of finding batteries.  Do not bother calling Canon for batteries, try the local WalMart.
