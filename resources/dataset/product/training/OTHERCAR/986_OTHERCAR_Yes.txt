            I got this vehicle to replace my Corolla Sedan.  I feel this is the ideal vehicle for my life style because:

* It is actually quite big!  I am 6'4" tall and head room has always been a concern in japanese vehicles. The 99 Corolla is quite small compared to the Matrix.  I have plenty of headroom both front and rear in the matrix.
* It is a sports car in SUV clothing! No kidding this vehicle really performs, with 180hp, a redline of an almost unthinkable 9000 rpm and a 6 spd close ratio gear box, speeding tickets could your biggest problem!
* It is a small SUV!  The Matrix has as much room in it as the RAV4.  I think it is optimally sized for 4 adults and still lots of room for luggage behind the rear seats.  Unlike the RAV4, the Matrix has a great flip glass/flip up hatch rear setup.  The RAV4 has that awful large swinging door setup which was most definetly carried over from Japan as it swings against a sidewalk (errr wrong way folks)!
* Fuel Mileage! Even with the high compression engine, the Matrix returns a very respectable 40mpg highway, hardly noticably less than the Corolla.
* Ride and Handling! Both ride and handling are very good, a nice balance between both and those 17" tires keep everything planted very nicely in the corners.

If you are looking for a do everything, fun vehicle with the versatility of an SUV and the gas mileage of a small sedan, the Matrix should be near the top of your list.
