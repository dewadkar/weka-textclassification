            My first mini-van was a Dodge Grand Caravan. We had to replace the transmission just after the extended warranty ran out around 75000 miles. I should be upset about that now but I did put 229,000 on the vehicle before I sold it and the new owner is still driving it. I see it parked at the church every now and then.

Hey I know this review is about the Chrysler Town and Country. I just wanted to let you know I had some experience with mini-vans and Dodge products. I love the T&C this van drives better and is 100 times quieter than the Dodge. The stereo is awesome and the leather seats are like sitting in your living room. We have the memory option on the keyless entry so when I pop the locks the seat adjusts for me. This is a great feature because it is my wife&#146s van and she hates it when I change her seat and mirrors. Our van has seating for seven, four captains and 1 bench seat. The quality is top notch. Our van has the AWD and it is fantastic on wet roads or when I pull my boat out of the water. In fact it&#146s kind of cool to watch some big pickup slide all over the boat ramp and I can just yank mine right out with the mini-van. OK I know it&#146s still a van and all that raw power can not make it cool. 

There have been two downsides to this van. 

#1 The windshield wipers will come on when they feel like it. They all do it and it should be a recall

#2 The AWD only gets about 20 MPG. 

That&#146s all the bad there is so if you are looking for a luxury vehicle with a ton of room buy a Town  and Country and you will be pleased.
