            Several years ago I rented a 1994 Oldsmobile Achieva Coupe for a one-month business excursion to the Naval Air Station at Patuxent River, Maryland. Enterprise Car Rental in Philadelphia had two kinds of cars available at the time - the Pontiac Grand Am and the Oldsmobile Achieva. I chose the Achieva because I liked its more conservative styling and the good reputation of the Oldsmobile nameplate. 

The car I chose was an Achieva S Coupe with the 2.3 litre 115 hp inline four-cylinder engine mated to a 4-speed automatic. It was a medium maroon color with a gray and black cloth interior. The car had a lot of amenities such as power windows and seats, and AM/FM stereo with cassette.
Unusual for a rental car, it even had a power moon roof. I liked the very sporty dashboard with its round gauges. The A/C was both effective and efficient.

The Achieva was the most conservatively styled GM compact of the trio of Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Achieva and Buick Skylark. Although all were basically the same car, they at least seriously tried to look like a Pontiac, Olds and Buick, each with distinctive sheet metal. This was perhaps GM's first attempt to escape from the &quot;badge engineering&quot; that plagued the company throughout the 1980s.

The two best things about this car was its power and spectacular gas mileage. Despite its small size, the 2.3 four cylinder powerplant was no slouch and the car almost had a sporty feel to it. The car could whip in and out of traffic with ease and handled very tightly around curves. The gas mileage was phenomenal.I swear I only filled the tank twice in the 1 month period I had the car. The car was also very happy on the 87 octane gas. The trip to Pax River from Philadelphia is 250+ miles one way. I returned to Philadelphia in two weeks and then drove back to Maryland and the needle on the gas gauge barely budged. The nearest mall was 38 miles away from Pax at that time and I made this trip several times during my stay. I even made a day trip to Annapolis on the weekend on about $3 worth of gas. Amazing!

Now, if there were any bad things I could say about the Achieva, they were minimal. The interior was slathered in plastic and rather flimsy stuff I might say. Plastic is a necessary evil in today's cars and I've even heard the new Rolls-Royce isn't immune to it anymore. I also hate the tacky plastic wheel covers that do a poor imitation of sport wheels. Every manufacturer both foreign and domestic is guilty of this. I wish they would go back to the stainless steel units of yore and use the much nicer styling of those old wheel covers. The stereo cassette eject button was a little strong. Pressing it nearly shot your cassette into the back seat. 

I didn't have anybody in the rear seat so I can't say how well seating was in the back. I'd recommend getting the Achieva sedan over the coupe if you have more than two passengers. Unlatching the front seat to allow passengers into the back is always a hassle in any coupe.

I'd recommend the Achieva S Coupe to any young single who is tired of the boy racer look of many coupes and wants a sporty but conservatively styled coupe for a modest price. 

The Achieva was perhaps Oldsmobile's first step toward the marque's recovery during the darkest days of its history. There were rumors of Oldsmobile being dropped at that time. I'm happy to see that GM has prudently decided to resurrect the Olds nameplate. Today Olds has perhaps three of the finest cars in three different price ranges - the pert compact Alero, the stunning midsize Intrigue and the awesome full-size Aurora. 

What about Plymouth, Daimler-Chrysler?<br><br>
