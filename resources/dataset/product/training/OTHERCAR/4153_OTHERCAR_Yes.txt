            I love my Rodeo! Despite the fact that it only gets 14 MPG city and 16 MPG freeway, I still love it.  

<b> Why I bought my Rodeo </b>
My previous car was a Honda Civic.  I used to be a bartender and one night, after getting off work at 2:30 AM, I was driving home and stopped at a stoplight.  A few seconds later I was rear ended by a very inebriated man.  After he was arrested, since I could still drive the Honda, I decided to take it home since I was only 2 blocks from my house.  I come to the next light which is green, I make a left hand turn, and ANOTHER inebriated man runs his light and crashes into the front of my car!  It was at this point in time that I decided I no longer felt safe in my little Honda (though it did protect me beautifully! Not a scratch on me! Neck and back pain, yes, but no blood!) So I bought my Rodeo.
And I have never felt safer than I do in it.  I realize that SUVs have a tendancy to rollover, but I'm no speed demon, and I'm very cautious around curvs & cloverleafs.  I have driven cross country about 3 times in it and it is phenominal in regards to comfort. 

<b> Great for long-distance driving! </b>
I could only drive about 3 hours in my Honda without having to stop and stretch my legs (and get some feeling back into my derrierre). But in my Rodeo, I can easily drive an entire 12 hour trip without stopping once (well, okay, maybe a bathroom break). 

<b> My one pet peeve </b>
The only inconvenient thing about it is the cupholders, which are awful!  the only cupholders in the entire car are located on the inside of the middle arm rest.  And they are supposed to stay in position by being held by little flimsy magnets which don't do the trick at all. Many a time I've had a drink that was catapulted into the back seat when I hit a bump which tipped the delicate balance that was holding the magnet cup holder down.  Not a good thing when you're going 60mph!  

<b> Electrical Problems </b>
This may say more about the dealer I bought my Rodeo from than the actual vehicle itself, but when I bought the Isuzu, the tail lights didn't work at all, and the dash lights didn't either!  And there was a funky little thing with the door locks ... they would occasionally unlock themselves! When it started stalling at red lights.. i decided to stop procrastinating and take it back to the dealer. I was really mad when the repairs to fix all these electrical problems weren't covered under the $2000 extended warranty I'd purchased! But oh well.

<b> Handling <b>
Okay, so I'm not an expert, but I do drive a lot. And I also actually use my sport ute for what it was designed for: off roading.  Even though i DON'T have 4Wheel drive, I still manage to nimbly climb through the rocky texas terrain on my familys ranch, and splash through mud without getting hung up on anything.  That's a REALLY big bonus because if it were to become stuck, it would be really hard to get it out again! We're talking really rugged terrain!

As far as city driving goes, I'm really happy with it. The V6 is very powerful and has plenty of pickup to get me up to freeway speed on Austin's notoriously short entrance ramps.  The only problem I've noticed is that it shudders a little bit when braking very hard.  But it accelerates smoothly and is relatively quiet even at high speeds.  

<b>Other Problems</b>
Okay, I'm putting this section in here just for those of you who don't perform regular maint. on their vehicles and don't know what can happen, AND those thinking about getting an extended warranty from Honda Care.  The previous owner of my Isuzu was NOT a very good parent.  In fact, we think they only changed the oil maybe once a year.  Well, I didn't know this when I bought it of course, there's really no way to tell without taking off the oil pan which NOBODY does.. so anyway. I'm driving along one day and all of a sudden the oil pressure drops to zero. I'm like "oh no.. that's bad". So I drive the rest of the block to my house.. (do i have good timing or what!? At least my rodeo was courteous enough to wait til i was almost home to die!) My dad, who is a mechanic, is very worried. He says it's either the electrical problems resurfacing, or something else is very, very wrong. Unfortunately, something was very very wrong. My engine was totally dead.  I had to spend $3000+ having the engine rebuilt.  Now, Honda Care was really evil about this!  I'd had the car about 9 months, and my dad had changed the oil twice and I'd had it changed at jiffy lube once.  Unfortunately again we didn't know you were supposed to keep all the receipts and everything if you change the oil yourself and the only receipt I had was from Jiffy Lube. So we were in trouble.  Even though the mechanic who rebuilt our engine wrote a letter to Honda Care saying that there was no way that this much buildup could have gotten on the oilpan in only 9 months.  But no no, honda care would hear nothing of it! So I had to foot the entire bill for the engine myself! I wish I had just saved the $2000 I spent on the extended warranty and put that towards repairs!  So buyer beware, read the fine print!
