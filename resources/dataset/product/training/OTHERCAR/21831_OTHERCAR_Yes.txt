            This car is awesome.  It has good handling and is ideal for driving long distances because it is comfortable, rides smooth, and has a nice sound system which is a necessity when driving long distances so you aren't bored.  One thing with the stereo system I noticed that it has a feature that the faster you drive the louder the stereo gets, by itself!  This feature is nice when you are traveling on a busy highway you get a lot of road noise and have to turn up the stereo to hear it.  The six CD changer is nice because you don't have to change the CD just pop in your favorites and its all good.  A con about this car is the rear suspension.  Yes a nice tight suspension is nice when you want a good handling car, but for a normal driving car, when sitting in the backseat and hitting a bump, is rough because you feel the bump, which then you feel like your riding a bus.  The overall feel of this car is nice.  Another nice point of it is the cruise control.  Its easy to use, and it is a good thing to have on long drives.
