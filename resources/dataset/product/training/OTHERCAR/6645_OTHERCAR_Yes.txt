            I traded in my 97 Jetta GL, which was bittersweet.  I was still enjoying the car, but found myself desiring a car that handled better, had more power, and few more extras like leather and power everything.  I found what I was looking for at my local Volkswagen dealer...
The 2001 Jetta GLX, made for the drivers that Volkswagen is wanting.  For starters the GLX has a 6 cylinder, 175 horsepower, high performance engine (will require you to purchase ONLY premium gas at least 91 octane, or you will suffer from sputter).  What a small price to pay for being able to pass in those short passing zoneswhere before you could only dream of passing Grandma and Grandpa out for a Sunday drive!  This car can accelerate.  Watch your speed, you can easily hit 85 on the freeway without even trying.
The GLX comes with a sport suspension that adds to the nimble handling, and gives you even more handling in situations where you need to avoid something in your path.  I've used this feature already when someone failed to see me coming and pulled out in front of me.
Had I hit the person at that time, I would've had an envelope of airbags around me.  Airbags from the front, above the side windows, and behind the shoulder create a bubble cushion in event of an impact.  I don't know of any other company that does this yet.
The GLX comes with power leather seats, which can be programmed to return to position when you use your key to open the car.  Volkswagen provides two keys, one for you and your significant other.  Not everyone likes the mirrors and seat in the same spot, this feature is a nice extra.  Everything is power inside the car, power windows, a new dial feature for the sunroof which eliminates the need to keep pushing a button to open the roof.  Heated seats are nice for cold climates.  Volkswagen Climatronic control keeps the environment at a preset temperature, and eliminates the guessing game we have all played trying to find that comfort zone.
The sound system has a Monsoon amp standard, which gives you added Bass and Middle control of the sound.  Bargain with your dealer to throw in a CD, as it is not standard, and only costs 349.00.  You will find controls for the volume and track on the steering wheel in the GLX.  It's nice to adjust the volume or change the song without taking your eye of the road.
On the other end of the wheel are the cruise controls, with speed adjustment buttons (cool).
Other extras on the GLX: Tinted mirrors, wipers that automatically adjust to the rainfall (ULTRA COOL), Rear view mirror that automatically adjusts for night.
People ask me how much I LIKE my car, I say "Ask me how much I love my car!"  The GLX was built with the driver in mind, comfort, handling, adaptability to environment, power.  This car rocks.
