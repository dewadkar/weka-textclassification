            I had the opportunity to drive, sleep and relax as a passenger last weekend in a brand new 2001 Chrysler Town & Country LX. After eating and sleeping in this vehicle for two days I believe I have a little bit of insight on this automobile. The 2001 Town & Country is a fourth generation minivan that performs well. 

Since I knew about Chrysler previous problems with the air brakes I�ve always warned my friends against the their minivans until now. After the journey had begun, I was pleased to find that this minivan brakes stopped quickly and gently. I had no problems stopping quickly with the standard four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes. The company wanted to avoid what happened in 1990-93 when they recalled 350,000 minivans with brake problems.  The 2001 has heavier brake rotors and new brake calipers to improve braking performance. 

This car really moves fast on the road with its 3.3-liter overhead-valve, powerful V6 engine kicking out 180 horsepower. The straight-line acceleration discharged enough torque to make me think there was a V8 engine under the hood. I liked the sensation of knowing that if I were in a jam, I could speed away or avoid danger in a hurry.  I probably used more gas than the average user since my foot is a little heavy but it appeared to get good gas mileage.  I'm not expert but it gets better mileage than my 1995 Pontiac. 

While on the highway I passed several cars with ease until my buddy asked me was I speeding? At first I said, �no,� until I embarrassingly looked at the speedometer; I was driving at an alarming 86mph. I decided to put it in cruise using the conveniently located controls on the steering wheel. 

There is also a digital odometer, which looks good at night doubling as the trip odometer when a button is pressed. Taken as a whole the instrument panel is driver friendly.  This minivan is smooth and comfortable, plus it drives handles surprisingly well at higher speeds. 

I�ve always wondered why they call these cars minivans when there is nothing mini about this van. It's more like a full-size conversion van, measuring 200.5 inches long and 78.6 inches wide. I drove my buddies roomy mini-van over 500 miles in a two-day period and came away impressed with the spaciousness. It was also easy to get into and out of the van because of it�s folding captain�s chairs and sliding door. 

The seats on the inside actually fold and remove however we did not need to take them out on this trip. As I loaded the minivan with our suitcases, it became apparent that the van was able to carry a considerable amount of cargo with virtual ease. 

Inside, the seating configuration consist of two front seats, two captain�s chairs in the middle row, and a rear bench for three. If filled to capacity, the minivan could comfortably seat seven adults. 

My buddies minivan came with a power sliding door on the passenger's side and a manually operated sliding door on the driver's-side. The door was easy to open and close with little energy. Let me be honest, my buddy raised his eye bras when I closed the door because I slammed it like a 1967 Chevy Impala. 

The manually operated door is easy to operate, smoothly sliding open and closing with the pull of the lever. The outside door handles comfortably, it�s easy to handle and well designed; imparting a feeling of quality in looks and design. 

Although there were no children on our trip I did check to see if safety locks came with this minivan. Yes! There is a switch on the trailing edge of the door that can be engaged to prevent opening the sliding door from inside. The power doors are pretty neat, just pull on the outside lever and they open with ease. My friend reminded several times that it�s not a manual door thus requiring less effort and oomph. 

During our trip I decided to relax and get a little shuteye in the back. Thank goodness the minivan had separate climate controls for both front passengers and for those seated in the rear. One of my biggest pet peeves is to be hot and sweaty while trying to sleep. 

My only problem is probably a problem I would have with any van if I were riding in the middle or rear. That�s the ability to let down the windows. The ventilating system in the car is nice; I simply prefer a window seat. This could cause a problem for if you want to catch a breath of fresh air. But who want to breath in all the Atlanta smog? 

I did not have to stop at the auto store and buy the plastic flimsy cup-holders that go in between the window and the door since this mini van had built in cup-holders everywhere even in back. If you live in the south were there�s lots of Sun you may want to get the windows tinted, there is lots of glass making for good visibility but poor shade. You can use one of the coat hooks to hang your jacket up which also shields out the morning Sun. However, the tinting on the side windows is adequate providing sufficient protection from the Sun. 

The instrument panel lights up nicely in addition the AM/FM/cassette stereo with Infinity speaker�s reaches every part of the cabin effectively. There are three dome lights that illuminate the cabin well but can be blinding at a dark rest stop when awakened from a deep sleep. 

By and large in terms of sophistication, performance, handling, and braking, the Town & Country LX is nothing like the recalled minivans of the early 1990�s. Overall this minivans has many convenient features. The only real negative I could find was the lack of oxygen for the middle and rear passengers. However the front and rear air conditioning with three-zone automatic temperature control should compensate for the lack of fresh air. 

Chrysler has taken the minivan market by storm with the 2001 Town & Country. This minivan is a multipurpose people-transporter leading the pack in the van wars. At prices ranging from the mid-twenties to the low thirties it�s a pretty good deal with all the bells and whistles.
