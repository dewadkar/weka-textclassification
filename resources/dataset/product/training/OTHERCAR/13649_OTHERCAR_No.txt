            I bought a 1998 Sportage based on it's low price, decent equipment list, and reasonable performance during test drive.  Not expecting sport car performance, I was not overly disappointed by the Sportage's poor acceleration.  Visibility is excellent from the front and rear seats.  Routine maintenance is easy, with caps and gauges readily accessible.  The Sportage was comfortable with two adults, two children and weekend camping gear.  My Sportage was in the shop 12 times for non-maintenance repair work within the first two years.  The rear main seal leaked, the front 4WD hubs failed three times, the coil-packs failed, the starter and flywheel required replacement and the horn shorted out four times.  The 4WD system is poor.  Shifting into 4WD is easy, getting out of 4WD is almost impossible if you drive on dry pavement for even short distances.  While this may not seem important, try driving on a snow covered road that varies between plowed and unplowed.  Every time you come to an unplowed section, you quickly pull over, disengage 4WD, backup and then continue.  My Sportage died with 36000 miles.  After six days in the shop with no rental car, no reimbursement and a repair bill in the thousands, I sold the truck to the dealer and bought something else.  $15K wasn't that good a value when weighed against many trips to the dealer, being stranded twice, and dealing with substandard performance.<br><br>
