            Owning my 1987 Integra has been a fun and well, wallet crushing experience.  I had bought my car from the Acura Dealership and I thought I got a pretty good deal. Only $3000.  The first problem I had was I had to replace all the fuel injectors ($400).  I have had to go through many tuneups and quick trips to the shop.  The oil leaked, transmission fluid leaked, my trunk was leaking the stuff it uses to keep the trunk open.  The list goes on and on, but the major stuff I will tell you now.  

I had to replace the transmission ($1500!).  It was either that or try to sell the car for barely anything.  Also one day my car would not start and it can only start in Neutral..?!  The car has been a problem ever since I got it, but for some reason I still like it.  I bought a nice stereo so I really don't want to give the car up.  What I really want is to get a new Acura (99) Integra. Those are sweet.  Well, I guess some people get lucky and some people (like me) get lemons. OH well, thats life.<br><br>
