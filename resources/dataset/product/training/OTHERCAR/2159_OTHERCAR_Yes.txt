            Ok.  I had my heart set on an Isuzu Rodeo from the time I first saw one back in 1991.  Visually, it was just such a &quot;Cute Truck&quot;!  I was unable to buy one until 1998, and I purchased a 1994 4-WD, 6 Cylinder.  I love the vehicle.

I love being high up on the road.  I love having the extra room inside the vehicle.  I love that the spare tire is outside the vehicle instead of taking up room on the inside.  I love the little sound the factory lock/unlock makes.  The truck handles well, but is a little top heavy for my liking.

Things I don't like about the vehicle.  There is a lot of noise when driving down the freeway (wind noise), and when it is windy, it can be hard to control.  My steering wheel doesn't tilt, which is fine for me, but my husband doesn't like where it is.  The seats are semi comfortable, but not plush.  This can get somewhat uncomfortable on long road trips.  Also, as mentioned by someone else, there are no cupholders!   This really sucks!  

The Rodeo has get up &amp; go, which I like.  The air conditioning works great, as does the heat.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants a solid vehicle with more room than a regular truck.  It is also a decent family vehicle.  It is reliable and semi roomy, but it is not luxurious.<br><br>
