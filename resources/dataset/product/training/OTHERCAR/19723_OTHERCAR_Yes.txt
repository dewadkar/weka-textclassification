            This camera is fat and Phat. I needed a new digital camera and so I decided on the Sony cybershot p30 for email auction pictures and printing out small pictures for my personal photo album. Sony p30 comes to you with some batteries video cord and usb cord software disk . I like it alot it has lots of different features and it gives you the choice of using the battery pack, regular batteries or a ac adapter. I won't even get into the battery thing all digital cameras are battery hogs lets get over that this camera is no worse then any other get some rechargeable batteries and rock on. You have different settings that you can take pictures in like black and white and sepia. You can also record movies. Now the movie feature is just something to make the camera sound better so if you looking for a camcorder then buy one this is a digital camera. You really cant complain about this feature because your not buying a camcorder and it does work. You can put animation clips together with this camera as well each picture can contain time and date or not. It has a total of 6x zoom  3 optical and 3 digital. I like that the zoom button is easy to reach however to me the zoom feature on this camera left me wanting more i like the zoom on my olympus a lot better than i like this one. If your into messing around with camera settings you can change white balance, flash settings and what not or you can just leave it alone and it will have it on regular settings for you. However there are a lot of settings you can change if you like doing that to make pictures look better but you dont have to and I found that the picture came out fine. A 4mb card on standard settings low quality can hold about 57 pictures  medium quality about 16 and medium high quality about 11 and high quality 7. Movie mode a 4mb card can hold about 20sec of video. Things you could use that this camera lacks. Lcd panel on top. Since lcd screens are very battery draining a small lcd screen on the top of this camera would have been nice so that you dont have to change the settings within the camera. The camera is kind of odd to hold i feel like my fingers are in the way it just doesn't feel comfortable in my hands. Not but it's not so bad you can't deal with it. It might be nice also to have some built in memory but thats not a big deal memory cards are cheap. Other than that I really cant complain
