            I personally am not a fan of the SUV, and that is because of the understanding that the SUV is a cash-cow for auto manufacturers.  However, my wife doesn't really care about such positioning and wanted a quality SUV.  Since I am the Man of the House, I acquiesed and opened active negotiations for SUV's, looking at Lexus, Acura, Mercedes, Isuzu, Nissan, and Ford, as well as the Toyota 4-Runner.
The 4-Runner is a mid-sized SUV that impressed me with a number of features, like its ride, maneuverability, creature-comforts, and most importantly, its re-sale value.  As pertaining to the last criteria, it is quite simply the best value among SUV's in the US market, with splendid value retention.
Plus, my wife loved it, over and above everything else we looked at.  

There is nothing overly remarkable about this vehicle to love, while there is nothing to hate about it either.  It is a solid, reliable, vehicle with  a dynamic appearance that should appeal to value-conscious drivers (though I think an SUV purchase is not a thrifty move).  The creature comforts are what I'd expect, and the arrangement is functional.

The ride on this vehicle is exceptionally smooth, while engine noise does provide some throatiness, letting the driver know that there is indeed a power-plant, and feel free to use it.  However, the V-6 does struggle a bit on steeper grades.  Cornering is slightly more nimble than its competition.  Braking is sturdy and dependable.  Gas consumption is average for a SUV of this size, and it does just fine with the cheap stuff.

Bottom line:  Enjoy this vehicle for what it is, one of the most reliable and best bang-for-the-buck SUV's on the market today.<br><br>
