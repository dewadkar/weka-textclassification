            First off, this review is of a 2003 GMC Envoy SLT that is fully-loaded at about $34,500.  If this is too pricey, look elsewhere.

<b>Initial Feel:</b>

When I hopped into the Envoy, my first thought was "Wow."  So many neat little things to play with inside the car!  It has buttons galore, but don't think it's too much.  They control things like heated seats, an awesome Bose stereo system, and 4WD capabilities, all of which kinda <i>need</i> buttons.  Another thing I noticed was this quiet little whirring noise as I got in.  The stereo was off at the time, and had it been on I'm sure I wouldn't have heard it.  Still, I asked the salesman what that was.  "Oh, that's the Luxury Ride suspension.  When extra weight is put on any wheel, the suspension automatically raises to flatten the car out."  Oh MAN is that cool!  Basically that means if I have to transport something heavy in the back, the rear suspension will raise the back end on its own so the Envoy always rides the same.  :)  When I took the car out of the lot, immediately I noticed its smooth ride.  Other SUV's like the Expedition drive like a truck with a loud, high-RPM shifting engine.  This drove much like my Impala in 2WD mode.  Completely smooth, quiet, low-RPM shifting was nice.

<b>Features:</b>

Here is a quick run-down of all the neat little things found on my full-loaded 2003 GMC Envoy SLT (more can be found on their website, gmc.com).

275hp/lb ft torque V6
80 cubic feet cargo

Some people have informed me that a lot of these things come on other SUV's too, but I haven't seen nearly as many as the Envoy unless it's a Caddy or Lincoln.

<b>Overall:</b>

The 2003 GMC Envoy SLT comes with about half of these things standard, and to get them all doesn't increase the price by a whole lot.  If you're looking to spend less, check out the Chevy Blazer.  If you're looking for more, check out the Envoy XL or the Cadillac Escalade.  If you just want an all-around excellent mid-sized SUV that will drive like a dream, then stop here, you've found the right one.
