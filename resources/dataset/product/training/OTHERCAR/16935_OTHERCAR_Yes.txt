            i first test drove the outback legacy 2000 model a couple of months ago because i was looking for a wagon in the 22,000 to 30,000 dollar range that was not german. that immediately left me with two choices: the outback and the volvo v40. the outback drove well with average acceleration and good traction. it was difficult to get a vibe for the car in one test drive because the dealer only allows one mile drives. once i drove it 2 times i found that it is a solid vehicle that drives well. there are a few setbacks however. the details on the car were not all designed well and the interior looks a little flimsy in general. compartments are cheaply made, the antenna looks poor, etc. 
    if you are a person who does not sweat the small stuff then this car drives well and is affordable. if on the other had you are someone who really loves gadgets, or needs a high performance engine, this is not the car for you.<br><br>
