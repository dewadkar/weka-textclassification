            In 1993, I saw a black 6-speed, twin turbo Supra.  It was love at first sight.  It happened to be snowing outside, so I left the Toyota Dealership with a Toyota 4-Runner that day.  This vehicle was so reliable and served me so well, that I became a fan of Toyota products.  Living in New York, I would frequent the drag strips.  Through this interaction, I became a big fan of the Mazda RX-7 and the Toyota Supra Twin Turbo.  

Cash in hand, I had to make a decision...&quot;..would it be a RX-7.&quot;  Which is unreliable, sexy as hell, but not an everyday car.   Or, the more reliable Toyota Supra????  Vinny Ten showed me the light and I purchased a white, Toyota Supra Twin Turbo.


Now I have cash to convert to a &quot;Single Turbo.&quot;  Now living in the &quot;Sunshine State&quot;, the speed limit is great and the roads are excellent, too.  I have found many other Supra Owners who agree.  

Mods were a must!!!  Lowered with Ebach springs, HRE 18&quot; rims, Greddy Dragger Exhaust,Boost Controller, FCV, Turbo Timer, and all Greddy intake. This car handles great, but not as good as my old M3. However, it sure costs less to add after market products too. Saving now for the new M3. <br><br>
