            I have enjoyed using this camera, my first digital. I find it easiest to use this camera as a basic "point and shoot" I hardly use the Live Image Display although tempted to. It's fun to play cinematographer, but It burns out the batteries too fast.

I don't mess around too much with the Capture Mode option's offered; shoot Micro, Landscapes, Portraits, or Action. My technique is too spontaneous for me to set the mode every time I want a shot.

More functional is the capture menu, not the easiest to locate and manipulate when you want to modify a shooting mode, but helpful when an artistic effect is desired. Items from the Capture Settings Menu that I use; The White Balance feature is good to be aware of, for example, If I shoot in the shade mode, even in bright daylight, I don't worry about back lighting. I also like the Saturation feature, nature can be Psychedelic. I leave all the other options to the default (auto) mode. I skip things like EV Compensation, although well laid out in the manual, it is too much to recall on the verge of a picture, the default (auto) mode will take a good picture.

Another Menu, the Playback Menu allows you to review your thumbnails, delete or rotate your images.

I guess I have to buy a memory card if I wish to shoot in only the 3.2MP mode. I only get 8 shots in the highest quality mode. The lowest setting is most memory efficient at 80  pictures. 14-18 pictures in middle setting is respectable. Next stop? 5MP maybe a digital SLR
