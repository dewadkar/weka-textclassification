            I recently visited the local <i>Volkswagon</i> dealership and test drove a 2000 <b>VW Passat GLS</b>.  The Passat was among the 10 cars that I was considering.  Another car that I was considering was the <b>Audi A4</b>, which is built on the same platform as the Passat.

<b><i>Are the A4 and Passat are the same car?</i></b>  

While the Audi A4 has sport-sedan tendencies, and the Passat has family-sedan tendencies, they are essentially the same car.  Both of these cars come standard with the 1.8 Liter <i>turbocharged engine</i>.  They also share the same general appearance and interior layout.  

The Passat is six inches longer and weighs about 150 lbs more than the A4.  On the other hand, the A4 is generally equipped with the optional <i>all-wheel-drive</i>.  The A4 stickers at $23,700, while the Passat GLS stickers at $21,200.  After doing some investigation, I found that the A4 is unlikely to be found at the base price.  Most of the vehicles that were shipped included leather seats and additional options that push the price to about $28,000.

<b><i>About the shopping experience...</i></b>

The sales people seemed very professional and knowledgeable.  Since I called ahead of time, I arranged to meet with a sales consultant named Rick.

One annoyance about Rick was that he wasted a half hour showing me features that I already knew about.  For example, he explained the <i>crumple zones</i> which protect you in the event of a crash.  Since this old technology comes on every car made, there was no need to tell me about it.

<i>One feature that I wasn't aware of</i>.. both drivers side windows can be automatically opened from outside of the car.  You place the key in the door, give it an extra quarter turn, and both windows will open.  This is a great feature because, on a hot day, this allows the hot air to escape the vehicle before you get in.

<b><i>A beautiful exterior...</i></b>

This is one of the most attractive and distinct sedans available.  The rounded shape flows up from the front bumper till it reaches the trunk where it drops off sharply.  The trunk shape has a familiar German look.  The long-wheelbase of 106.4 inches gives it a sporty stance.  The unique appearance is in contrast to the cookie-cutter styling of the competition... namely the <i>Taurus, Accord, and Camry</i>.

Unfortunately, the GLS comes standard with 15 inch steel wheels and plastic wheel covers.  For the price, this car should be equipped with alloy wheels.  The paint scheme is tasteful and has body colored bumpers and outside mirrors.  The lower two inches of the car (including the rocker panels and front spoiler) have a matte black finish.  Like many German sedans, there is a reflector located on each side of the car.  The Passat's reflectors are just in front of the front doors.  

It does have the telling VW logo over the front grill.  While Volkswagen has come a long way in the last ten to fifteen years, it may be difficult for some to overcome the past notions about Volkswagen.  ...that is as the maker of such econo-cars as the Beetle, Rabbit, and Fox.

<b><i>The Interior is fitted with high-quality materials.</i></b>

Even the base GLS is well equipped.  Among the <i>standard features</i>, you'll find keyless entry, power locks, power windows, 6-way adjustable drivers seat, and three power-accessory outlets.  The remote for the <i>keyless entry</i> is uniquely integrated with a folding key.

The <i>cloth seats</i> are comfortable and have a high-quality feel.  Thankfully, the 6-way adjustable drivers seat rises evenly.  Many cars with height-adjustable seats tend to raise at an angle, with the front part of the seat rising less than the rear part.

The front seats are very comfortable.  However, I was disappointed with rear-seat space.  Both the leg-room and head-room were tight, and I'm 5'8&quot;!

The 15 cubic foot trunk is average, and when the rear-seats are folded, includes a large pass-through.  Inside the trunk, you'll be pleased to find a full-size spare tire.

The dash is very classy looking.  The hard edges of the colored center console and glove box blend nicely with the black plastic dashboard.  The gauges are nicely placed and include fuel, tachometer, temperature and speedometer.  The gauges have a black background, contrasted with blue markings and red needles.

<b><i>Fun to Drive!</i></b>

My expectations were high to begin with.  I've always been fond of German engineering and I expected that this would be a fun car to drive.  <i>I was not disappointed</i>!

The five-speed manual transmission was one of the best I've tried.  However, I found 1st gear to be too short.  Under full throttle, the car reaches it's redline faster than I could react.  This is particularly troublesome when trying to accelerate through a turn.  Since you need both hands to turn the wheel, you cannot reach over and shift when it redlines.

I was very impressed with the 1.8 liter turbocharged engine.  VW says that it produces 150 horsepower and 155 lb/feet of torque.  This is about 10% higher than the class average.  The expected fuel economy is 23 mpg in the city and 32 mpg on the highway.  <i>It does require high-test fuel!</i>  

This car is <i>not</i> plagued with turbo-lag.  That is a condition where the car slowly accelerates and all at once the turbocharger kicks in.  The Passat's power curve is smooth; it starts right at 10,000 rpms and curves upward to the redline.  The acceleration is brisk.  Edmunds tested the car and quoted a 0-60 mph time of 7.9 seconds.  The class average is about 8.5 seconds to 9 seconds.

What can I say about the handling?  This is a German Sedan.  The ride is stiff and stable, yet the occupants are not likely to feel many bumps.  This car gives you great driver-road connectivity.

<b><i>Things to consider.</i></b>

Some consumer magazines have reported worse than average reliability on all VW models.

You may have a hard time finding a car equipped the way that you want.  According to the local dealership, Volkswagen's cannot be special ordered.  You can only choose from the cars on regional lots.  It was also explained that the majority of Passats are shipped to the U.S. with extras like leather interior and/or Automatic Transmission.  

I was also disappointed to find out that if I wanted a sunroof, I would have to invest in a $1,500 package that includes alloy wheels.  I knew that if I were to purchase this car, I would stretch myself to my self-imposed spending cap of $25,000.  I opted to save $5,000 and purchase the less exciting, but more roomy and better equipped Saturn LS1.<br><br>
