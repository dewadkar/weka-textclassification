            The Mercury has a sleek and powerful look.  I have just bought mine and am so excited. I drive it everywhere. It is powerful but not too sporty. I really enjoy this car. When my other car broke down I decided to get a strong, capable, and luxury car that was not too expensive. This car is as easy on the wallet as it is on the eye.

This car is very conservative. It tells everyone on the road how well you live and are living (old or young). The Mercury Marquis is one of the last rear wheel drive vehicles that is v-8 powered on a seperate frame. Buick LeSabre, Chrysler Concorde, Pontiac Bonneville, and Toyota Avalon, are all competetors that are more modern with front wheel drive and V-6 powered engine. The Marquis offers the comfort of a town car with the price of a mid-sized luxury vehicle.
 
The Marquis constists of the GS(22,805) LS(24,705) trim levels although both of them are powered by the same engine, a 4.6-liter V8 coupled to a 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission. This I think is a perfect combination with the handling and the power the engine produces (sometimes I like to rev up the engine and just smile) but when you are on the road it is the comfort I enjoy. The LS comes with premium stereo, premium cloth upholstery, power lumbar support, an illuminated keyless entry system, and chrome wheels.  

The newer Marquis are improved with a higher peak horsepower and a higher torque at a higher rpm with the single-exhaust form. It reaches 220 horsepower at 4750 rpm, and 265 pound-feet of torque at 4000 rpm with dual exhausts, which come optional on GS and standard on LS, those number are 235 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque.

When you get into this vehicle it brings you back when you were a kid in those big, bulky, roomy cars. I just can't wait to take the family on vacation. No more fights about room and the best part is you don't have to be huge to drive this car even though it is so big it makes even more comfort for the short driver out there. The bench seats keep you comfortable even when making those sharp turns but I can only find one drawback for this vehicle. It is the large hump in the floor. It creates a little problem when sitting in the middle but it can be overlooked. 

About the rear seat comfort area, I would say it is at the top of the market. Also, the trunk space has alot to brag about. It is huge, exactally 21 cubic feet. In the 2001 Mercury Marquis  everything seems to be in the exact place that it should be.

Before I first bought this car, I took it on a test drive and my impression was, "is this car on?". It was so quiet, I couldn't hear anything, not the slightest peep of the engine. Even though the wind was blowing this car handled great in crosswinds and when on dirt roads, the suspension was great. The suspension was modified in 1999 and since then I can say it is the best ride I have had in a long time( no more back problems).
