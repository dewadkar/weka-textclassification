            This review applies only to the Celica ST, which was knocked out of the lineup for 2000 with the redesign.  My 1995 sample was bought used at 60,000 miles.  The ST had the engine from the bargain-bin Corolla, rated at 110 horsepower (105 in California).  The engine is raucous and gutless, but it contributes to spectacular fuel economy.  My last fill-up wound up yielding 32 mpg, purely in city driving.  The handling is tactile and very responsive, with perfectly calibrated power steering.  This is one great chassis.  The styling is very sexy, with muscular lines and a curvaceous, bug-eyed fascia.  All my friends at school love the way it looks.  It came with a long list of options, including power windows with a one-touch driver's side, power mirrors, and powerful A/C.  It was very expensive -- the Corolla-based ST could be optioned above the $20,000 threshold and a fully loaded GT model could approach $30,000.  Now that prices have settled down to $13,000-17,000, it definitely seems a lot more reasonable.  Oh yes, and the interior is sparse but still superbly finished.  Typical Toyota thoughtfulness abounds.  It's impossible to lock yourself out of a Celica; it will unlock the doors if you try.  The cupholders are questionable with the manual shifter, fine with the automatic.<br><br>
