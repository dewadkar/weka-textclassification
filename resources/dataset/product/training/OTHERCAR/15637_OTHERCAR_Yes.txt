            This camera has one of the best optical zooms in its class. Its Digital zoom is good as well, but it is not near as clear as when you are using optical. The camera itself is great, with a very large screen to see everything you are looking for.


I bought it because it has a screen and a viewfinder. We use it out side for our webpage, and there could be better resolution but when we bought it about a year ago this was the best that was availble. Using it is easy, and the floppy disk interface is alot better then a flash card or something similar. I love that it is so easy to use, and it makes 60 second videos. 


I don't like the size. But, the lens is so large because it is so use. You sacrafice size for funtionallity. 

Anyone that wants a high-quality camera for personal or business use should buy this camera.<br><br>
