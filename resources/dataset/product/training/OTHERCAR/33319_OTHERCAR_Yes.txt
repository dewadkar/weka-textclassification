            I bought a new 1998 Subaru Forester S in April of 98.  I now have over 50,000 miles on the car.  My parents and I looked for a new car for me to take to college that would be all wheel drive and had enough storage room to lug everything to and from school each year (Home: Ohio, School: Massachusetts).  I looked mainly at this vehicle and the Toyota RAV 4.  The Forester had more room inside and didn't look like a GEO Tracker.  So far, it has been excellent.

THE MAINTENANCE UP TO 50,000 MILES: I changed the tires at about 45,000 miles and I change my oil every 3,000 miles.  The brakes will need to be replaced in the near future.

PROBLEMS: Besides the several accidents I have been involved in (none have been my fault), the battery was not giving enough power to the starter and I had to have the battery replaced (under warranty) around 20,000 miles.

THE GOODIES:  It has heated seats which are great in the winter, it handles great during a 6 hour drive through a blizzard from Maine to Massachusetts, enough room to fit everything in my dorm room for the trip back home every summer, and reached speeds of about 110mph on the Mass highway and no hint of instability.

BOTTOM LINE: The Forester handles like a car and has a comfortable ride.  If you want all wheel drive at an affordable price and don't need to have a huge amount of room in the trunk (like that of a Ford Expedition or a Land Rover), this is a great vehicle to consider.
