            My camera is now 2 years old so it is time for an update.

  I have taken tens of thousands of photos in all sorts of situations in various parts of the world. The 10 X zoom lens,image stabiliser and  excellent colour reproduction were the main reasons for my original purchase.
 
  Plusses I hadn't counted on were the panorama feature, a wide angle alternative. The 35 sec. video with sound, great for action clips. Finally the rapid fire feature great for birds at a feeder or sports action. These 3 features are all used extentisivly. B&W was great for my Mothers family albums, the Kodak box brownie photos are reproduced and cleaned up with Photo Shop 7 with amazing results.  

  Additions: I purchased a Lowenpro waist bag, never use the lens cover. An extra set of batteries and always go with a spare set, seldom have to change during a days shoot 200 -300 shots easily at 1600 x 1200 on a 128 Mb card. 2 Extra 64 Mb cards, I wore one out (Gold thread worn away) so have replaced it with a 128 Mb card
I also purchased a 20GB Nixvue Digital album which is essential for a shutterbug. Just down load the cards at the end of the day and view images on a TV in any part of the world. I have used it in Canada, New Zealand and Ireland with great success.  Security at airports have no idea what it is and don't bother to find out even in the USA.

  Weaknesses; dust gets in the viewfinder and needs to be blown out every now and then. Small screws release it and a negative brush blower cleans it up. The rubber grip finally came unstuck, it needed retrimming and regluing but even with contact cement didn't stay on for more than 5,000 shots, so I don't bother with it. The grip is still fine.

  Summary; Still works well, always pleased with colour and resolution. This camera has been up in helicopters, planes, open sports cars, motorcycles and bicycles, always in its bag which is well padded. I feel I chose an excellent camera and the fact that the number of photos is no longer an issue is wonderful. I save my photos to CD and occasionally prints some up on a HP 930c printer which gives excellent results up to 10' x 8'

  If faced with another purchase today I still feel for a serious photographer this will satisfy in most situations as the results and the ability to experiment with the settings is almost unlimited
