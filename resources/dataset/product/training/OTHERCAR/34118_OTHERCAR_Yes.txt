            I have a 1991 Dodge Shadow ES Turbo that I bought new. I have since put 170,000 trouble free miles on it. Other than the usual gas, shocks, and tires (6th set), all I've had to replace are the front wheel bearings and the transaxle (manual transmission) that gave out just this week. The turbocharger and even the clutch are original, which is unheard of in a car with this many miles on it! My Shadow has the 2.5 liter turbo engine and sport suspension options that make it a thrill to drive. The engine cranks out 153 horsepower and delivers a whopping 215 pound feet of torque to the front wheels.
The engine still purrs like a tiger and I have never had to add oil to it between 5000 mile oil changes. Granted, I have babied this car but I have done the same with other cars and none have been as reliable as my Shadow.
The only people I would warn away from a '91 Shadow Turbo are parents who are considering it for their teenage son, who will spend all his allowance on speeding tickets! The 135 mph top speed is too tempting. The base 2.2 or 2.5 liter non turbo engines would be a smarter choice.
This car has been the most cost efficient car I have ever owned, and I've had a few in my 40 years.
If you need a great used car for a great price find a '91 Dodge Shadow. Just don't come looking my way... because I'M NOT SELLING!... EVER!

Here is a list of repairs made to my '91 Shadow and may indicate to you what is in store for you if you purchase a used 1990 or 1991 Shadow ES with the turbo engine:

AM STEREO/FM STEREO/CASSETTE HEAD UNIT (Infinity-optional)@ 12,000mi (covered under factory warranty). I have since upgraded to an aftermarket stereo system because I wanted CD.

BATTERY @ 20,000mi (I blame this not on the battery, but on many road trips to Moab, Utah in the blazingly hot summer heat with the above mentioned high power/high current draw aftermarket stereo system cranked and the air conditioner full blast. On one occasion, the water in the maintenance free battery boiled completely dry).

REAR SHOCKS @ 75,000mi (This many miles from a pair of shocks is not bad and there was nothing wrong with the shocks except that they felt less "sporty").

RADIATOR REBUILT @ 100,000mi $250.00 "ouch!" (The turbo model is equipped with a high capacity cooling system because of the high heat associated with a turbocharged engine and should not be a problem with the 2.2 and 2.5 liter non-turbo engines).

FRONT STRUTS @ 125,000mi $225.00 (I could of spent a lot less but I went with high performance models and, once again, only because the originals felt less "sporty").

LEFT AND RIGHT FRONT WHEEL BEARING ASSEMBLIES @ 135,000mi $140.00ea (I must admit that I never had them serviced as Chrysler recommends, but even so, they lasted a long time).

TIMING BELT @ 140,000mi $150.00 (I have since learned that you should replace the timing belt on any car at about 90,000mi as a precautionary measure, as when it breaks it could cause major damage to the engine. When mine snapped, the engine was fine. This is either a testament to my luck or to the invincibility of the Chrysler 2.5 liter 4 cylinder engine!).

R/H HALF SHAFT (C/V JOINT) @ 169,000mi $212.00 (Not bad mileage for a C/V joint that has had as much as 215 pound/feet of torque applied to it for 169K miles).

TRANSAXLE & CLUTCH @ 171,000mi $1065.02 (OK, this one hurt, but I know it could of been much worse. The manual transmission started making noises about 1000mi prior and finally "exploded", evidently throwing pieces through the casing, making a rebuild impossible. The turbo model transaxle is different from the non-turbo models and is hard to find. My "trustworthy" mechanic...he has to tell me the truth because I work on his airplane...found a "beautiful" trans in Idaho and says he gave it to me at his price of $550.00. The part had 30,000 miles on it. I believe my mechanic when he says that this is a rare find. Once again, persons deciding to buy, and you should, a non-turbo model will have no such problems finding parts. I only replaced the clutch because mine was saturated with oil from the transmission failure and I didn't feel right about putting it back together like that. Problems would of surely arisen. This repair was completed today 6/22/2001 and when I drove it home, I didn't notice the grinding noises of the failed transmission, but the sweet growl of the engine...I immediately begun my search for V8s to embarrass...I'm in love again!)

TURBOCHARGER @ Still pumping! @ 171,000mi! (Mitsubishi built this turbo for Dodge and it is sweet! I have had no problems with it. It produces 15psi average at full throttle with no noticeable lag...the 153hp is developed at a low 2800rpm. 

In closing, this car is a crystal-meth powered workhorse! Even before I replaced the trans and clutch, I figured the trade-in value was well below the enjoyment I would have by keeping it. I believe it to be a new-age collectors car. After the last 4 years of no car payment, the repair bills pale in comparison. I absolutely love this car! Could you say that about yours?

INEXPENSIVE!! GREAT VALUE!! BUY ONE!!
