            -The Toyota 4runner is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I have a 1991 grey 4runner with 238,000 miles on it.  It runs like a dream.  The most money I have ever had to put into it was a few hundred dollars for a new clutch.  And minor repairs that are of the norm on any vehicle.  It looks great and anyone will look great driving it.  Driving this vehicle, one feels like the king of the road.  Girls love it and guys dream of owning one.  The 4runner lacks width but has plenty of cargo space to haul the family on a week long camping trip.  Or even put the dog in the back.  This SUV lacks performance in acceleration, with the 3.4 liter, compared to the hefty 4.3 vortec in the Chevrolet Blazer.  But is one hell of a machine on the trails.  I recommend buying the 4runner; however not leasing it.  There is no point in paying the hefty ticket price of $450-$550 per month to have this awesome auto for the short time of three years.  This vehicle will last you at least ten years, no problem.  If you wish to lease, pick up the Chevy Blazer for $200 less per month.  This SUV is all about class.  Driving the 4runner you feel like you are better and more powerful than anyone else.  The small 3.4 liter not only lacks performance, but also gas milage.  For being almost a whole liter smaller than the Blazer, one would think that Toyota would have come up with ways to conserve gas.  All in all the 4runner is the best SUV on the market.  But don't take my word for it, go to your local Toyota dealer and take one for a spin.  You will love it, guaranteed.<br><br>
