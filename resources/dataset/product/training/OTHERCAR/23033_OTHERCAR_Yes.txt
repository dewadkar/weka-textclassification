            This camera was given to me for my birthday and it really is a great camera. The price is really reasonable and the quality of the picture in 640 x 480 is really great. One great thing about this camera is the usability. A dummy can still take good pictures. I also like that fact that the transferring of picture to my computer is easy. The PhotoMAX software make the copying to your computer easy. I also like the fact that you can disregard the pictures you like very easily. One thing I didn't really like is the lens setting; the optical viewfinder does not change position when lens setting is changed. Another this is the capacity that can hold when taking a high resolution is only 12 pictures. This is a great camera and I really recommend it.<br><br>
