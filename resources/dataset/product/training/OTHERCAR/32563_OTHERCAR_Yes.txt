            After having a used car for three years, I decided that it was time to invest in a new car and stop paying for repairs on my old one.  After looking at many different options, I decided that the best car for me was a 4 door Saturn SL.

I bought my car in the Summer of 1997 and I am still in love with it.  I enjoyed the way that shopping for this car was handled.  I never felt pressured to buy a Saturn, unlike other places that I had gone.  The sales person made me feel very comfortable and gave me information that I could use.  I liked the no haggle price and felt that I was not getting ripped off.  I looked and Consumers Reports and knew that I was getting a good car for the money. I like that I get great gas milage, especially since it is so expensive right now.

One down side to my car is that my large male friends say that it does not have enough leg room.  I do not have that problem, but if you are a tall person, you may want a different car for leg comfort.

When I was looking, a friend of mine who had a Saturn suggested that I look into buying a Saturn.  I am very glad that I did, and I would recommend this car for anyone who is looking for a quality not to expensive car.  In almost three years I have had no complaints except for one.  I got a car with a tapedect because I have a portable CD player, but a safety tool for the tapedect would not allow me to use the disk I had and I had to purchase a different one.  If I had a tape that was being eaten then I would be happy with this safety tool, so I guess that a few dollars is a good investment.    <br><br>
