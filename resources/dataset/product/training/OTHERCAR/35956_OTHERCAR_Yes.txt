            Last June I purchased a brand new 1999 Honda Civic LX and have been very satisfied with it ever since. It gets excellent gas mileage, offers great steering and control and provides a smooth, comfortable ride for driver and passengers. The last car I drove was a Honda as well (1993 Accord EX) and I would have driven it much longer had it not been totalled in bad car accident (I'm OK though, thanks for being concerned). The '99 Civic provides an overall great ride for a very reasonable price. I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a dependable car with a reputable name and doesn't want to pay a luxury price. I am not sure what comes standard on the '99 Civic so it is best to check with your local Honda dealer before deciding on a final purchase. <br><br>
