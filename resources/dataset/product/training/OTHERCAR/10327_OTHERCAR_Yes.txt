            I've had the the pleasure of owning my 1990 Plymouth Laser for approxamatly 3.5 years of dependable low cost service,as you know it's nothing more than an eclipse with the Chrysler pentastar logo stamped on it.Other than basic maintenance and the replacement of some front end parts i.e Tie rod ends and ball joints along with new cv boots it's been a great daily driver.  You must keep in mind my Laser had approxamatly 77,000 miles on it when I purchased it, it now has close to 113,000 miles showing on the odometer so I guess these could be considered normal wear and tear items.I've been sacreligous about oil changes and maintenance and I'm happy to say my Laser run's just as good as the day I purchased it,has NEVER and I repeate never failed to start for me and even when the orignal sparkplug wires went bad after 88,000 miles it still ran! I bought the vehicle because my younger brother had one and was pleased with it and I liked it's sporty looks also it had recieved good reviews from consumer report's magazine.I have the RS model with the upgraded suspension and 2.0 litre twin cam engine that is factory rated at 135 horses it is essentialy the same motor used in the turbo which the factory rates at 190 horses. It handles nimbly, accelerates smartley (I've suprised more than my share of larger engined sport's car's )And overall has been a good car to own.   <br><br>
