            I, a lover of Sports Utility Vehicles, was in the market for an SUV truck that could cover all the options that I like.  
After test driving nearly all of the SUV out on the market, I came down to tree choices: Toyota 4Runner, Honda Passport, and Dodge Durango.  

I really loved a few things about the Durango, and that was the front grid.  It is like a monster truck that will not stand to anything and when you add-on the protected gear, that's when it really transforms into a monster.  It is well powered by either the 5.9L V8 or the 5.7L V8 engine, that will drain your gas tan empty alone with your wallet.  The interior of the truck is well design, the third rear seat come in handy for when you have extra visitors, and to cool them of in the summer time the rear A/C vents.  

With the things that I liked about the Durango, there were also a few things that I did not like about it.  The reasons why I chose the Passport over the Durango was the engine, the Durango has to come up with an engine that is smaller less gas consumption that the available choices.  I heard that Durango was introducing a V6 engine this year but I never saw it, I went to 3 Durango dealers and none of them had one V6 engine Durango.  Another thing that I did not like about the Durango is the rear red turn/hazzard lights, I'd much rather have them orange, they are more eye catching then the red turn/hazzard signal lights.  and the last but most important thing that I would like my SUV to have is the rear latch window to open, like most of the SUV's that I test drove.  If Dodge makes these changes to the Durango, I return my Honda Passport for a Dodge Durango.<br><br>
