            I bought this camera in late July of 2002 and I love this thing.  I have been in the market for a digital camera, going to different websites and seeing what's out there, going to friends who have digital cameras and see what they recommend, and (OF COURSE) coming to Epinions.com and reading what you people thought.  I've made my decision and the 3.2 MegaPixel Sony Cyber Shot SDC-P71 is what I chose and I'm glad I chose it.  This camera has so many options built into it yet it is very simple to use.

<b>Basic Image Shooting</b>

This camera is great for your basic image shooting.  Just point and click and the camera stores the image in the Memory Stick for fast viewing.  You can zoom in and out of an image like any regular camera.  With the Memory Stick in the camera you have the option to view the last image you shot and if you don�t like it you can delete the image with no harm done.  As a matter of fact you can delete any picture you want.

<b>Macro Feature</b>

The camera comes with a Macro feature that allows you to take good close up pictures like bugs or blades of grass or even pictures of your friend�s nose (now that�s up close and personal).

<b>Self Timer</b>

The camera allows you to take shots of yourself, or shots where you can include yourself, with the Self Timer feature.  The camera will give you a good 10 seconds before the shot is taken.

<b>Red-Eye Reduction</b>

All good cameras should come with this feature and the DSC-P71 is one of those good cameras.  You can set this option on or off to whichever picture you want but I don�t know why you would want to have red eyes on your picture.

<b>Scene Shots</b>
When shooting scenic shots or shots in the dark with people present the camera gives you 3 options in how you can take the picture.  You got the Twilight mode for taking pictures under dark lighting conditions.  Twilight Portrait mode is available for taking pictures of people under dark lighting conditions. And you have Landscape mode for taking those images at a distance

<b>LCD Screen</b>

This is one of the CONS I found about this camera.  Although the picture that is displayed on the LCD is very clear and colorful the LCD is quite small.  I was looking at other digital cameras with bigger LCDs but they didn�t have the features this camera had.  Though it is small I am able to see all the menu options crystal clear.  This is a CON that can certainly be overlooked by the many PROS this camera possesses. 

<b>Memory Sticks</b>

The camera came with a 16MB Memory Stick in where you can store up to 5 full screen shots (full screens on your computer).  If you wanted to email them you would select the picture to be a 640x480 size and you can take around 45 shots.  For post card size shots you can take about 10 � 12 pictures.  I purchased the 128MB Memory Stick and my options for taking pictures have pretty much quadrupled.  With the 128MB Memory Stick I can take 780-email size pictures, 200 post card size pictures, and about 80 full screen shots (again on the computer).  The only downfall about the 128MB Memory Stick is the price.  It runs between $80 � $95.  I ordered 2 128MB Memory Sticks so that�s almost another $200 I had to fork out but I feel they�re worth it.

Don�t forget to format the Memory Sticks, VERY IMPORTANT!!

<b>Shooting Movies</b>

I was surprised when I found out this feature came with the camera.  You can record about 5000 seconds worth of movies with the 128 Memory Stick.  The major CON about it though is that there is no sound.  Then again (like I said before) this is  camera and not a camcorder.

<b>Additional Features</b>

With this camera you have the ability to view your pictures on your TV.  The camera comes with a VIDEO OUT jack and the wires to connect the camera to the TV.  I�ve tried this already and it�s a great feature.  Especially when I see it on my 27� Sony Wega TV.

Another obvious feature is the ability to transfer the pictures from the Memory Stick to your computer.  I noticed that the transfer rate from the Memory Stick to the PC is quite slow so I purchased a Dazzle Memory Stick Reader ($30 bucks) and the time it takes to transfer the pictures from the Memory Stick to the PC is almost instantaneous.  You can do whatever you with the pictures once put on your PC.

<b>NOTE</b>:  If you take a picture and save it on a 16MB Memory Stick and transfer it to your PC, and then you want to place that same picture back in a 64MB Memory Stick, it will not work.  The way the Memory Stick is formatted will not allow a picture that was taken on a 16MB Memory Stick to be viewed on a 64MB Memory Stick.

<b>ANOTHER NOTE</b>:  Once a picture is transferred to your PC you can name the pictures whatever you want.  But, once you rename them you can�t view them on the Memory Stick.  The pictures will still be on the Memory Stick if you transfer it onto the Memory Stick but you will not be able to view it.  Every picture you take is given an ID number and once that is changed you can�t view it.  But like a portable storage device you can carry the picture in the Memory Stick and view it on another PC or the same one at another time.


I�ve invested great time and research in finding my first digital camera and I�m glad I came upon the Sony Cyber Shot.  I recommend this camera to first time digital camera users.
