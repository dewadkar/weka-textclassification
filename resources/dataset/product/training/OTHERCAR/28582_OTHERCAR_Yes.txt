            Jeep wranglers are the best. I own one my sons own a total of three.They will go where other vehicles cant. We take ours across creeks, up into the woods.We use ours for hunting and getting the groceries. ours is a 1987 gray and black hard top kind. The interior in ours is perfect. The only thing i dont like about this years is the square headlights.The newer ones now have round head lights like the older models.You can turn around in them so easly and the larger cars are harder to do this with.My son has his all decked out with crome, its really sharp and it is a 1979 model. I would buy a wrangler again anyday.The new one are just beautiful.If they dont come with rollbar padding i would recomend getting it.We looked at some new ones and they did not come with this it was extra.<br><br>
