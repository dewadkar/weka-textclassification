            After driving all the mini vans on the market, reading all the articles, surfing the net for user comments (like here) and talking to real Kia mechanics �.I bought the Kia Sedona EX, all options for $21,500 (The dealer even threw in 3 years of oil changes!)

I only have a couple hundred miles on the van, but everything is perfect; no rattles, no squeaks, no problems. It drives great and is very quiet on the road. (I will report any problems in the future) 

As a service to those who are in the market for a minivan, I offer the following to consider:

#1. There is really no question about the value of the Sedona when comparing it to the other minivans. You would have to pay $7,000 to $10,000 extra to get a comparable mini van from Honda, Toyota, Dodge �  

#2. The only real question mark concerns the quality and reliability of the Sedona. To address this issue, Kia offers the best warranty on the market. 

To put my mind at ease, I also talked to 3 different mechanics, from 3 different dealers, and they all said the same thing�The Sedona is the first vehicle Kia has produced that meets the Japanese in terms of initial quality and reliability. (The Kia cars are getting better, but still have room for improvement). In addition, none of the mechanics saw any consistent repair problems � yet. 

Two of the mechanics thought that if there would be a problem it could be in the area of brakes. The fact the Sedona weighs 500-800 pounds more than other mini vans may require more frequent replacement of the brake pads. The other mechanic thought that the Kia engineers would have designed �beefier� brakes to accommodate the extra weight. I guess only time will tell.

FYI - For those of you who may be wondering about the Honda Odyssey �magic� third row seats that fold into the floor consider this�. Your only option with the third row of seats is �all or none�. 

What does this mean in the real world???? 

Well, my neighbor has an Odyssey and we were going to travel with 5 people and lots luggage (which required the removal of seats to accommodate the luggage) 

The problem with the Odyssey �magic seat� is if you make them disappear, so does seating for 3 people. So you are left with lots of room for luggage, but seating for only 4 people. (Of course you could remove 1 of the middle row chairs for luggage storage, but this is inconvenient placement of the luggage and 2 people have to sit in the less comfortable third row of seats) 

With my Sedona, I just removed one of the third row seats and we were ready to go�A comfortable chair for each of the 5 adults and room for the luggage in the back (where it belongs) 

If Kia were smart, they would introduce a split �magic� seat on their next van�
