            My family has reached the point where it's time to graduate from a station wagon to a minivan.  Being the deliberate, purposeful hunter-gatherer that I am, I began with lots of research: Edmunds, Consumer Reports, etc.  It all led me to the 2001 Honda Odyssey.  

Now I have owned Hondas before and did not need to be sold on the reliability factor.  While competitors such as the Windstar and Grand Caravan offered many of the same features, and still more that the Odyssey doesn't offer, I was kept away by stories I'd heard and read about their questionable reliability.  Maybe they were true and maybe not.  Since I have confidence in Honda products generally, the Odyssey was the more prudent choice on that basis.

The handling is remarkably car-like.  We traded in a Honda Accord wagon and the only real difference with the Odyssey is that you are higher up.  It is just as nimble.  The V6 engine is certainly powerful enough for the driving we do.  I enjoy driving it.

The stying was sleek and utilitarian.  Nothing eye-popping, but this is a minivan we're talking about, not a sports car. I was also drawn by the fold-flat third row which is easy to operate and such a convenience that it is difficult to understand why other manufacturers didn't immediately jump on the bandwagon.  As far as I know, only Mazda has tried to copy it.The third row seat can also flip over to provide seating facing out the back.  I presume this is for tailgating.

The current Odyssey is roomy for people and cargo.  It compares favorably to other quality minivans like the Sienna which has almost no cargo room if all the seats are being used.  Room for the taller driver is satisfactory.  I am 6'8&quot; and headroom and legroom are a big concern.  Happily, I can fit into an Odyssey EX thanks to the power adjustable seats.  (Windstars and Caravans aren't too bad when it comes to roominess either.) The LX seats are less adjustable and I found it hard to get a comfortable position.  Gas mileage is probably as good as it gets for minivans: 18/26 mpg.

The Odyssey comes in two trim levels.  The LX has most basic amenities and retails for about $23,600.  For $3,000 more the EX gives you a CD player (no cassette, though), power sliding doors on either side (a big plus), power-adjustable driver's seat (important to me, as noted above), captain's seats in the middle row, alloy wheels and a luggage rack.  It also has remote keyless entry which operates the power side doors.  A very nice convenience I hadn't really expected.  It's probably worth going for the EX if you can afford it.

The real adventure comes when trying to purchase one.  It is rare to find one on the lot and most dealerships will tell you it's a 3 month wait.  That can be a huge problem if you need the van NOW.  If you can wait, it still is challenging to coordinate the sale of your old car with the arrival of the new Odyssey.  Then comes the issue of price.

The demand for Odysseys so far exceeds the supply that dealerships will not stray far from MSRP.  More that one dealership told me they adhere to MSRP and maybe throw in floor mats as a bonus.  That's pretty underwhelming for those of us accustomed to the wheeling and dealing of car buying.  I finally found someone willing to sell me an EX for $28,000 including tax, etc. which was something like $255 under MSRP.  I tried to use the offer as leverage with other dealerships and was told that I should take the offer in a heartbeat.  

Also, for what it's worth, my mechanic (not a Honda mechanic) gushed that the Odyssey was a much higher quality vehicle than Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler, etc.  He felt the Windstar was pretty good, but not in the Odyssey's class.  Not my words - his.  I hope he's right.
