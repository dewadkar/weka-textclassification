            I bought this vehicle because 1)It had a great rebate, 2)The dealer talked it up like it was something out of this world 3)The dealer gave me a good trade in

I liked it because it was sporty, yet inexpensive, it seemed well built and, well... it was brand new.

My list of reasons why I hate this vehicle is much longer.

1. Windows open by themselves at speeds of 50mph+
2. Strange undiagnosed noises in engine compartment
3. Electric problems as well as fuses blowing constantly
4. Too light on the road to be good in the snow
5. Door dropped on hinges

Let me elaborate...

On the way home from the dealership I noticed that the driver side door didn't shut good, I called them and they said it was because it was so new and it was airtight, and that it would correct itself with use. It hasn't.  I also noticed after about a week that my windows kept pushing down by themselves if I drove over 50+mph. Dealer had no explanation and couldn't fix it.  I developed a strange grinding noise in the engine compartment which dealer can't diagnose nor has fixed. (It sounds like it's metal being dragged over a hollow piece of cement) My door, about 10,000 miles into it's use dropped on the hinges and had to be replaced. My interior light sometimes won't shut off, sometimes it won't turn on. It really depends on the day! My fuses continually blow. I never know if I'll have radio, lights, lighter, heater etc. from one day to the next.

These are the major problems I've had with the vehicle in its short 20,000 mile lifespan. I'm happy to say that none of them are severe mechanical ailments, but the point is that they're annoying and shouldn't happen at all. 

This vehicle looks cute and is cheap. But I've learned that it might be better to spend a little more on a more reliable, well-built vehicle the next time.

Other bad things are that the resale value is virtually non-existent. You'll never have a decent trade in, you'll always end up owing extra money because no dealership wants a Neon in trade.

This car is good for nothing, unless you want to spend hundreds trying to fix GLITCHES that the manufacturer should have worked out.

My recommendation is not to buy it, you'll be sorry.<br><br>
