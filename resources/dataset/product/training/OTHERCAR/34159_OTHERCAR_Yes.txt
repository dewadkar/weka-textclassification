            I have a 1994 Camry XLE and I am amazed that after 80,000 miles the car rides as if it were new.  The v6 is smooth with plenty of power.  The vehicle needs little maintenance and truly lives up to its reputation.

As for any drawbacks this car is disappointing in the snow and I definitely recommend snow tires as a must with this vehicle.  This is also my first car with anti-lock brakes, which really changes the handling of the car in icy conditions, both good and bad.  The vehicle could also be more stylish, but it is classic Toyota. 

The car comes with an excellent factory premium stereo with equalizer.  The seats are very comfortable.  The trunk is roomy and the back seats go down for additional space.  This is my second Toyota and I would recommend this vehicle new or old.
