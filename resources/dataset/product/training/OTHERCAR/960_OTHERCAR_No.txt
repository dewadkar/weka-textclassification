            I bought the new corvette thinking that it was much better than the previous model (the c4).  It handles a little better, but the interior of the previous Corvette is much sportier.  The performance is about the same.  Magazines say the new model is much faster, but they are wrong.  I still have my 1995 model with a 6-speed, and I would put it up against the new Corvette any day.  The new model is much stiffer, which is a good improvement over the previous model.  I do get a lot of compliments on my new car, but I get more on my 1995 model!  To pay 40,000 for this car seems a little steep.  There are too many of the new Corvettes on the road.  If you are looking for just raw performance, you need to check out the new Camaro SS.  It has all the horsepower and acceleration that the Corvette does for $15,000 less!!  It is a beautiful car, but if I were you I would purchase either a nice used model Corvette or the new Camaro SS.<br><br>
