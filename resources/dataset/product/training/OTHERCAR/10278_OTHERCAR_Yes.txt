            This is the third vehicle that I have owned, but it is my first new car.  I absolutely love it!  I bought the Nissan Sentra because it is small and economical.  It allows me the luxury of space on the inside without the bulkiness of a bigger car.  

I love to drive it because it handles so well.  Having put over 60,000 miles on it in two years, it has needed very little maintenance.  It holds to the road well, and has a smooth easy ride.  It loves to hug the curves, which it does so well.

Driving this car has been a pleasure.  As a single person, it has been the perfect car.  This car is also an excellent choice for small families.  It has a big trunk which can hold walkers, portable playpens, etc.  The back seats folds down which also allows for more storage.

This car is not a good choice for those who like to rough it.  It does not work as well off the road.  For those who are looking to purchase a car with a good reputation, that is affordable, and is low-maintenance,  the Nissan Sentra is the perfect choice for you.<br><br>
