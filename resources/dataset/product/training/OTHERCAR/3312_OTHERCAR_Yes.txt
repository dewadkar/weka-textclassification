            I purchased a brand new Toyota 4Runner in 1995.  As of Today, the Truck has made it's way through the Gila Mountains Trails in NM, Texas Mud Bog season, NM desert Baja fun, Texas Fire Departments Bi-Weekly Mud Bog (they empty out a few of their water trucks, and the trucks around just bogg in them).  For any of you in the SW, my runner made it through the Craters: Dead Man's Hole, Kilbornes Hole.  

It also taken me from Los Angeles, CA to El Paso, Tx and back over 10 times.  I can honestly say that this truck is as durable as Rock.  It took torture that none other would have handled, and it's still running.  Stock tires may need to be replaced, but the overall perfomance this truck has shown me is incredible.

BEWARE:  Gas Mileage--This is not a Sedan, and for a 200-225 miles per 15gallons is nothing to bragg about.<br><br>
