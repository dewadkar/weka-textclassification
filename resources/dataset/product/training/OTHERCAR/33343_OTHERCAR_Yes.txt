                 My parents bought this car because it offers space enough so that our hole family can fit in it and so that we would not have to get two cars. I don't know if they wish they had taken that Minivan and thrown it out the window.
     The Minivan. Where to begin. Its space is so little that moving is a hassle, but none the less, it does provide space enough so that people can sit, but if you are in the market, get a new one; it is worth it. 
     The '92 Minivan offers little for the user. The user in fact cannot really use any electronics for his or her convinience. After a while, the doors get hard to open, and if not tended to will take the strength of two to open. The belt in the car gets worn down, and is not pleasant to drive for the few minutes it takes to get completely ripped apart. The drive is bumpy, and try to avoid going hard over pot holes. The car though despite all these problems (and many more) has held up over the past 8 years, so they are ok. 
    People with large families should buy this. Otherwise, stay away from one.<br><br>
