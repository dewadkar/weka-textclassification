            I've had my 1999 6 cylinder king cab Toyota Tacoma just short of a year.  This little truck can do it all.  I've made two 800 mile trips in it, both of which were considerably comfortable rides, at least as well as can be expected in a compact pickup.  On one of those trips I towed my wife's Pontiac Sunfire without any noticeable difference in the ride.  The Tacoma even held consistent highway speeds on cruise control through the hills of Pennsylvania with my wife's car in tow, without so much as a hiccup.

The 6 cylinder under the hood provides outstanding acceleration and power to do all the work your heart could desire.  The Tacoma has more horsepower than any of the other compact trucks, excluding the 8 cylinder Dodge Dakota (which is only marginally cheaper than most full size trucks).  Unlike the Ford and Chevy compacts, the Tacoma's rear seat faces forward, allowing me to put a car seat in back for my son.  The back seat is hardly suitable for anyone besides children, but if I'd wanted more room I would have bought an SUV or fullsize truck.  The Tacoma's just the right size for the off-roading enthusiast to hit the jeep trails and it has all the tools necessary to have a ball!

The stock stereo (even the high end Toyota system) leaves a little to be desired and is relatively easy to replace.  The console of the Tacoma is very serviceable, yet still looks primitive compared to many other trucks today.  The ride in my Tacoma is very quiet, except for one very annoying squeak (the driver's seat!) that I plan to have taken care of right away.

The Tacoma really excels in performance and serviceability, and you'll  be hard pressed to find a better looking truck. The 31.5&quot; tires and off-road package give the little truck a very substantial stance.  Most faults that I found in the Tacoma, would most likely exclude you from considering this class of vehicles anyway (i.e., the small back seat).  If you're looking for a small truck that has a reputation of outstanding performance, you'll not be disappointed.<br><br>
