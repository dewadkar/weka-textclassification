            I have nothing but great things to say about this Olympus Camedia Brio D-100 Digital Camera!  Since I have bought it, I have had amateures and professionals alike marvel at the quality of photos this little camera puts out!  The 1.3 Megapixels gives a very clear picture.  Alot of nice features are on this camera such as: Red Eye Reduction, Filler Flash, Night Flash, Auto Flash, 2x Zoom, Up to 9 Picture viewing in the 1 1/4 inch LCD screen, 3 Different quality outputs(helps with optimizing memory space), Sequential picture program and different lighting adjustment, PLUS it came with an extra 16mb memory card($30 value!)along with the 8mb card, just to name a few.  The Camedia Master Software that comes with it is both easy to use and offers lots of nice editing features.  In my opinion, there is absolutely no comparison to other "under $200" cameras out there!  I have discovered from comparing pictures taken from my camera and ones taken from my friends/families $500+ cameras, that obviously they paid $350+ too much for theirs!  The only somewhat negative thing I can say about this camera is that, like all digitals, it uses up battery power quite quickly.  The BEST way to remedy that is to buy some Rechargable Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries along with a Battery Charger, and you are set!  You will literally pay for the NMH batteries and charger(about $40 for four batteries and a charger at any electronics store) over and over again if you decide not to get them.  I would and have recommended this camera to ALL of my friends and family members!
