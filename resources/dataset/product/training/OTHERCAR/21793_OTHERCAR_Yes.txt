  I had been a long owner of Ford and Chrysler vehicles and decided to 
change over and try out the Chevy Tahoe.  I liked the appearance of
the vehicle and also its ability to carry the amount of items which I have
become accustomed to carrying when I travel. Further I liked the idea of the Vortex Engine and its extra power. When I purchased this vehicle, I was concerned with the gas efficiency, so I inquired about getting a higher gear ration for the rear axle. The standard ratio was 3.73 : 1 for the model with the trailer package, but I ordered my vehicle with the 3.41:1 ratio(I believe that this is correct). On a trip I get around 14.5 miles per gallon while in town about 12.0 mpg. The power, ride and convenience of this vehicle surpass all that I have ever owned in the past.
     The 350 cu inch engine with its fuel injected feature gives all of the power that I expected when pulling my 3000+ pound boat up and down through the mountain passes in California. Also this vehicle has 4 wheel drive.
     The only two problems which I have encountered with this vehicle are: the front brake pads wear out prematurely. I replaced the first set of pads at 12,000 miles, with scouring to the rotors. At 21,000 I replaced the pads again, just in time with no scouring to the rotors. At 
32,500 miles a third set of front pads were installed. The rear shoes are the original and are still about half good.
     The second item was that two fuel injectors went bad, and were replaced at no cost to me, under warrantee. The dealer suggested the I 
put a 22 once bottle of (injector cleaner) in my gas tank about once a month. I have had no recurring problem with injectors.
    Overall, I love the vehicle, it appearance, it power and would certainly buy another one when this one gets close to 100,000 miles.
