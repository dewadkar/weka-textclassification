            When I first began my driving career at the age of 16 my parents wanted to get me a larger car so that if I was ever in an accident I would be well protected.  So my father and I went to the car lot and looked around.  After driving several cars such as the Buick Le Sabre and the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme I decided on a 1986 Chrysler New Yorker.  Little did I know that I had bought the best car that I could ever have as a first car. 
This New Yorker was the four cylinder Turbo model, which I seriously suggest to anyone who is about to buy a New Yorker.  Also the New Yorker is a very luxurious car for a cheap price.  My New Yorker cost around $2500 and had only 70K miles on it.  Some of the awesome features were Digital Display Instruments, all the way around Leather Seats that were very comfortable and adjusted to any position, and a Talking Reminder that says many phrases such as &quot;Your Oil Pressure is Low&quot; &quot;Your Fuel is Low&quot; and &quot;Your Lights Are On&quot;, which was the coolest feature ever.  The New Yorker has a classy feel and a nice powerful shape.  The turbocharged engine is peppy and very tight.  It also has a rear suspension that adjusts to how much luggage you have in the trunk.  If you are about to buy a New Yorker you will want to see if this option is installed and still working.  The New Yorker has a six speaker sound system and is a  smooth ride too.  The only downfall to the Chrysler New Yorker that I had was the CV joints were getting bad when I sold it 2 years and 90 thousand miles after I bought it.  All in all this is an excellent car.<br><br>
