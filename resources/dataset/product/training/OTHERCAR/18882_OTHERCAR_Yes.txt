            I bought mine used in 1998, with 55000 mi.  Now (2002), with 88000, It still runs beautifully. This is my second 1991 Eclipse. Note: The Turbo model is much better than the non-tubo, automatic I had before.

I love the design of the car.  mine has the full ground fx, alloy wheels, premium sound package.  It's like a little personal fighter jet. As you walk up to it, it looks like its ready to blast off.  Get in and the Cockpit wraps around you.  You might find yourself looking for the joystick.  Instead, the pleasant leather steering wheel and shifter knob meet your eager palms.  Put it in gear, and you are ready to fly! But be carefull, This car is fast, and it just begs to go fast.  I had a bad habit of speeding, until too many tickets forced me to stay out of third gear around town.  And fifth? Save it for the interstate.
   Actually, this car would have benefited from a six-speed.  Acceleration is phenomenal, It beats z28s and 5.0s off the line, and the top speed pushes 160.  With six gears, it could be even higher.  And all out of four cylinders.  I was worried that the turbo might go, but it hasn't.  I can still smoke the tires if I try.
     The handling and feel of the car may make you think you're in a race car.  the seats are so low, you feel like you're lying down, and the cradle you just right.  The steering is very tight, and you don't even have to get off the gas to take tight corners.  The shifting is fast and smooth, but be carefull with the clutch, as the turbo may take a bit of getting used to. Compared to newer models, this has a sportier, less "squishy" feeling.
     One of the best, unexpected benefits of this car is that the shape of the canopy really lets you get the most out of your sound system. I saved a lot of money because of this. There is no need at all to install a super-powerfull stereo.  Mine came with six stock speakers, and they sounded great, until they wore out. (And I like My Music Loud!) Then I put in a cd-changer and replaced the door and backseat speakers, and had a system that, for practical purposes, sounded as good as any. (OK, so it's not ideal for buzzbombing, but who needs that anyway? I bought a stereo to make my music sound good, not the other way around.)
     Aside from the child-sized back seat, my only complaint would be that they used such thin metal on the body panels. You'll see a lot of these cars with bad door-dings.  Mine's got a couple little ones, but pretty clean.
   Eventually, some of the electronics have gone out (Cruise control last year, speakers as mentioned), but overall, the car has held up great. it has never broken down, and except for the speeding tickets, has kept me out of trouble.
