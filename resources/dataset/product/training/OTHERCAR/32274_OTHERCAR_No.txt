            I've just recently gotten into photography, and I started with a Canon Rebel X, decided I wanted something a little more advanced so I could grow into it, so I got a Nikon N65, I really liked the solid feel of Nikon gear, and the 995 stands up to that. I moved on to a Rebel 2000, and have used that for a little while before getting the digital bug. So I went out and got myself a brand new Coolpix 995 after reading excellent review after excellent review. 

I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed for a $1000 camera. 

I've taken indoor pictures with the flash that look horrible, looks like I used a spotlight on the subject. Yes, I have set all the settings, I've tried different white balances, exposures, etc. Not to mention the yellow and blue blotches in the shadows I get when shooting indoors without a flash, and even with one. I'm sure that with the flash bracket and a Nikon SB flash, I could get better results, but that's extra money to spend on an already pricey 3.34MP camera. 

The menus are a bit complicated, but if you play with them for a little while, they become more user friendly. The camera is a bit slow for action, as there is a bit of a lag from pushing the shutter, to the camera actually taking a picture. My first 5-10 pictures were of blurred faces of my family. 

On the other hand, I've read that this is THE digital camera to use for macro work. I haven't personally used the macro features yet, but I'm sure it works fine. 

The lens does drive me crazy with it's constant grinding, I keep wondering when it will fail. It seems like for $1000, Nikon could have splurged for a little gear lube or something! 

The LCD viewfinder has a pretty sharp viewing angle, and dosen't fare well if you look at it slightly from above or below, or else you get blacked out parts of your screen. 

I don't know if I got a lemon or not, but I've also noticed that a lot of my pictures are a bit soft even when using the sharpening modes, and the DOF is horrible. I usually get about a foot of depth even when using the landscape mode. I've tried Aperature priority and everything, nothing seems to work. It seems that the camera just has a shallow DOF, from most of the pictures I've seen. 

I'm returning it tomorrow and buying either a Canon Elan 7E or a Nikon N80. I've tried digital and I'm running back to film as fast as my legs will take me. Your mileage may vary. I hope that I didn't miss out on a great camera just because I got a lemon, but it seems that's just how they work.
