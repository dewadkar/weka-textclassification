            Front wheel drive twin turbo?  Drive one and you'll appreciate the awesome control and response from the turbo version of Volvo's new top end sedan.

This car is my third Volvo in as many years.  My first Volvo was an 850 GLT non-turbo, my second was the same.  Yet, as I was shopping for my third I decided to test drive the new S80 T6 just for grins.  The  comfort and luxury of the interior is unmatched.  Driving the car is extremely fun.  The handling and engine response is superb. I prefer driving the S80 over my spouse's 5 Series BMW, so does she.

The new look of the S80 is also a winner.  Although it's quite different for a Volvo, the new lines and wheels are striking.

Don't forget about the safety factor.  Volvo has one of the safest cars on the road.  So if you have kids, you get performance, looks, and safety (not necessarily in that order).

It's a great car that will still perform and look good in 10 years.
