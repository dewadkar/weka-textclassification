            I found this camera online for $120.00, and have been pleased with it's performance. Good quality pictures, best at close range(ie:3-9ft). Fill flash very helpful in low lighted areas. I put a 4mb memory card in it which doubled the picture intake, but the 2mb card is plenty. I use only the high resolution setting of the camera. Enjoyable for play or work. The only negatives I have found are that the batteries sometimes lose continuity with the circuit, but is easily fixed after re-alignment within the camera. The date has to be reset after every battery change. The LCD screen devours batteries rather quickly. My recommendation for this camera would be to get a good set of rechargeable batteries at the same time of purchasing the camera. Overall a good piece of work.
