            Pros:
* Performance - I drive quite fast most of the time, and this car handles it well. Good response, good cornering, nice highway ride & handling (with the 3.2L).
* Profile - I really like the looks of this car, as does most everyone that sees it.
* Leg Room - As a tall man, I admire a car with adequate leg room in the backseat, and this one has it.
* CC - The AC, sound system, power seats & mirrors are all nice.
Cons:
* Front head room - not enough head room, especially with the sunroof, for someone 6-6 or above.
* Trim - some of the seals around the doors, headlamps, and other parts of the trim keep slipping & sliding.
* Transmission - Goes through transmission fluid very quickly. Will probably be the first thing to go.
* Noise - While I like the engine noise, there is way too much road & wind noise.
* 2.7L - not enough engine, go for the 3.2L
