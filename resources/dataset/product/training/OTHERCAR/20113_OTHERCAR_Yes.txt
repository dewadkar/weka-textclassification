            Let's do some comparison, here.  The BMW M5 weighs several hundred pounds more than a C5 Corvette.  The M5 is a full sedan, the Vette, barely two seats.  The M5's engine: 5.0 Liters; the Vette's: 5.7.  And yet, the BMW squeezes out 400 horsepower as opposed to 345 from the Vette.  Also, the M5's acceleration figures match the Vettes, all the way up to its electronically limited 155 MPH top end.  But we come to the crux of the matter with the price tag.  A good Vette comes to $45,000 while the BMW runs you $70,000 or so.  So what's the verdict?  Undoubtedly, the BMW is worth every penny more.  For the extra $25,000, you get a full sedan, a lot of style, and, perhaps most importantly, fit and finish.  After all, nothing ever falls off a BMW.

Specs include a 400 horsepower M-spec engine, 245 wide rubber with 13.6&quot; front disc brakes, 12.9&quot; rear discs with 275 wide Michelin Pilot Sports.  Included with BMW's are several systems designed to keep you on the road, including a Dynamic Stability Control System.  Safety features include several airbags, including side curtains.  This adds up to a blazingly quick 4.8 second 0-60 run, topped off with buckets of style.  If you've got $70,000 burning a hole in your pocket, I can think of few better ways to rid yourself thereof.<br><br>
