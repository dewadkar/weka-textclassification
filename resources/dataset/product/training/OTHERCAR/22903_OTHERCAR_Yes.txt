            My father who owns a construction company brought his red Ram in 96. He then raised it, installed new tires, and added a fog light system. Recently Miami went through a hurrican that caused serious flooding throughout our neighborhood.  We probably received over 12 inches of rain a day for two days.  I must say that even though it is not the most luxuriest thing and it guzzles gas like water we were the envy of the neighborhood because not one drop of water entered inside it. Not only that but  while none of our neighbors could use their cars because the engines had stalled, we were getting on with out normal lives.  Dont get me wrong, it drives like a ton of bricks and is difficult to park, but I can guarantee that my father's truck will ever stall out because of water intake.  If you want a dependable, sturdy, large truck and live in areas of tough weather then I would definately recommend one of the models of Dodge Ram pickups because it will get you through whatever situations you encounter.<br><br>
