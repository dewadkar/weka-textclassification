            When I was expecting my baby we bought a Caravan, before we were fitting 2 adults and four children in a Rodeo!  I really love this van, it is roomy enough that we can travel comfortably in it, and the built in car seats are an added bonus!  I drive this thing everywhere!  Sometimes I wish we had the Grand Caravan, but I think we definitely got our money's worth here.  This is a great van for small families too, since you can lug all of your kids friends around!  Single men should not buy this van because single women will think you are MARRIED : )<br><br>
