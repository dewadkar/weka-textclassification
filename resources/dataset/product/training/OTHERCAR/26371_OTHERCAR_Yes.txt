            We have a 1995 GMC Yukon SLT and love it.  The leather seats are comfortable and easy to clean after the kids have a spill or after a fishing trip.  We also use it to tow our 22 foot cabin cruiser, and it handles it with ease.  It is excellent off road as well, just be careful not hang the running boards on a rock.  If you are going to buy a 4 wheel drive should use it. The only problems have been normal wear and tear items.  The Yukon gets about the same gas mileage as my 97 2 door Ford Explorer with allot better ride and handing than the Ford.  Our next vehicle will be a new Yukon.  I do not understand why someone would spend more for less vehicle.  <br><br>
