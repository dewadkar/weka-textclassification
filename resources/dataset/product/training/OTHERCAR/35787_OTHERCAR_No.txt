            I have had a lot of trouble with my Saturn since I purchased it.  I am the owner of a Saturn SL1 1994 which has run hot since the first week I have had it.  Today, my mechanic gave me a TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN issued for a MAJOR MAJOR PROBLEM WITH SATURN Engines from 1991-1997.

The following is information from the Technical Service Bulletin


Technical Service Bulletin (issued 2/01/97) Number (96-T-65).  You can check out and review consumer complaints, recall notices and technical service bulletins on WWW.NHTSA.GOV

ENGINE RUNS HOT AND/OR ENGINE OIL MIXED WITH ENGINE COOLANT IN COOLANT RECOVERY RESERVOIR

Vehicles Affected:

1991-1997 Saturns equipped with SOCH (LKO-1991-1994, L24-1995-1995)

Condition:

Engine may run hot and/or have engine oil mixed with engine coolant.  This condition may be noticeable when checking coolant recovery.

Cause:

Some 1991-1997 SOHC engines may develop a crack on or near the camshaft journals and surrounding casting areas allowing engine oil to mix with engine coolant.  These cracks may be caused by &quot;folds&quot; in the aluminum that occur during the head casting process.

Basically what this means is that you need the entire cylinder head assembly.  This could also cause the engine block to crack!  THIS IS A MAJOR MAJOR ENGINE PROBLEM AND ITS COSTS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY TO REPLACE.

I never knew about this until today.  Saturn Corporation has known about this since at least this Technical Service Bulletin was issued on 2/1/97.

For more information on Technical Service Bulletins go to WWW.NHTSA.GOV(National Highway Transportation Safety Association). If you car is under WARRANTY please get it fixed ASAP or have them check and document the engine is okay otherwise, you are in deep trouble with your car like I am right now.

I am really serious.  I cannot believe that Saturn never ever informed me of this problem.  I feel they should issue a recall on these cars and fix them instead of making us owners pay THOUSANDS to have this fixed.
