            Friends,

If you are ever planning on replacing your 35MM regular camera, the NIKON Coolpix 800 would be your choice. I purchased my Coolpix 800 through the internet for $320 at www.mobshop.com This camera's price tag is one of the main reasons I considered it. Most cameras that pack in the quality this NIKON packs are around $700. 

*UPDATE* Click here for a $75 off &lt;a href= http://www.nikonusa.com/assets/coolpix950rebateform.pdf &gt; NIKON REBATE&lt;/a&gt; if bought between July 1 - Sept. 30 2000 !

Ever since receiving the camera, I have been awed by it's picture quality. It can take pictures in great detail, showing vivid colors and details. The ergonomic design of the camera is another reason why I am in love with this digital wonder. Nikon did a wonderful job manufacturing this camera.

This camera is actually manufactured in JAPAN, a sign of unprecedented quality.

My greatest delight was when I submitted my pictures to www.shutterfly.com a company that prints out your digital pictures on developing paper. I received my prints from them and was dumbfounded!! The quality of the prints were EQUAL to any 35mm camera. That my friends is a reason beyond all other reasons to purchase this camera. 

I have only one small gripe about this camera, in incandescent lighting situations, the white balance is not as great as I had hoped. Basically what I mean is that indoor shots with poor lighting need to be properly tweaked once captured.

Thanks for reading this review. Please *rate* it!
