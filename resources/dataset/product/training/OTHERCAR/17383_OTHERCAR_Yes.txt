            The car in question is the 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS.  I bought the car in auto (rather my mom bought it for me in auto because she doesnt want me to drive a stick since she has some weird notion that its more dangerous).  I LOVE THIS CAR!  

First let me tell you about the engine.  Although this model is NOT a turbo and its 0-60 is not jaw-dropping, I do say that the car has pretty quick acceleration for what it has available to it.  It always seems to have a nice fast feel to it and it always feels good to rev it and go at the line.  I also love taking this car going around 50 or 60 on turns.  Its amazing how the car remains glued to the road with no tire skidding.  I still however envy the illustrious GSX.........a wonderful piece of car.  The stereo is decent in that it comes with 6 speakers, a CD player and standard AM/FM and tape.  The styling of the car always pulls stares from the crowds and i love the attention i get everytime i drive my car around town and around my college (its red....a real eye catcher).  The ladies love it.  

There are flaws however.  As noted in other reviews the front bumper does tend to bottom out and hit the ground on certain curves and dips.  But for the most part it damages the unseen parts of the car and leaves it relatively unnoticeable.  I also have the &quot;turbo&quot; spoiler which is hard to see when going in reverse.

All in all however, i LOVE this car.  Greatest car i ever drove.  I test drove the integra and the civic and these cars do not give me the edge-of-your-seat feeling that this car gives me.  Could be that fat ass that the eclipse has that gives it the extra kick ey?
