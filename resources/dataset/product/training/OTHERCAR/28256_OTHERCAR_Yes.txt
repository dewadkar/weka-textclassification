              The reason I purchased this vehicle was for my wife to take our two kids to school.  The vehicle is not too tall or long, which makes it easy to back up.  The vehicle has plenty room for two or three kids.  The Durango handles really well, and has plenty of &quot;get up and go&quot; too it.  The only set back for the vehicle would be that there is  not a lot of room behind the third seat.  If you need cargo room, folding down the rear (third) set provides adequate room.  With all of the rear seats folded, two bikes can be perfectly positioned, and with accessories like tents that connect to the rear of the truck, this makes for a good camping vehicle.
  Just as the national commercials advertise, the Durango is perfectly position between the big SUV's and the small SUV's.  Ideally, this makes this a perfect vehicle for female drivers as well as your teenage kids taking a spin.  
  We have a 4x4 which handles very well in the snow.  Overall, we're very pleased with our second SUV.  We have a large SUV and this medium SUV.<br><br>
