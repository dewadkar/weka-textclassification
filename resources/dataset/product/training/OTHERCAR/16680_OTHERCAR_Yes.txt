            We bought our 1999 Sable in April.  It is a very smart looking vehicle and handles nicely.  My husband is 6'3&quot; and he has plenty of head and leg room when driving this car.  The trunk has lots of room - I hauled 20 cases of soda, 4 suitcases (2 of them quite large - my 13 year old daughter's stuff) and 4 large sets of steam table pans and frames with no problem.
 
 There are only 2 things I dislike about the car, and 1 would prevent me from ever considering it again.  I HATE the footrest for your left foot.  There is no way you can stretch your leg out straight.  I end up with my knee completely bent or with my foot turned sideways along side the footrest.  It is very uncomfortable on long drives, and I end up changing the seat position up, down, lay the back down, bring the back up straight, anything to get comfortable for awhile.  It is really miserable if you have a sore back! 

 The other thing I find to be a minor inconvenience, but annoying just the same.  I do not like the way the high beams come on.  Instead of pulling the lever towards you, you push it to the back.  I always end up putting the blinkers on along with the high beams.  What were they thinking when they changed it??  <br><br>
