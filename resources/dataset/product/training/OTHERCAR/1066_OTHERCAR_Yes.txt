            Since our family had grown from three to four and our older Mazda was reaching its end it was time to purchase a new vehicle.  Our eight year old is a hockey player and with all his equiptment you practically need a car just for that.  With two children, and friends to &quot;taxi cab&quot; around we needed room.  A second concern is that we now live on the top of a very steep hill.  The winter before we had the Jeep my Mazda and my husbands Jetta could not make it to our house at the top of the hill.  That winter was not  very bad so we began to realize that it was time to have a vehicle which is four wheel drive.  We had also decided that it was time to buy American.  I drove the Jeep liked it and that was it.  I am now a huge fan and can't wait to replace my husbands Jetta with the newer Jeeps.  I love the new feature of not having the spare tire in the trunk allowing more trunk space.<br><br>
