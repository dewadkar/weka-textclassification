            Now, I knew that the lovely folks over at Konica Minolta made good cameras, but I was very much surprised at the advances they have made in the new Z1.

Having had the camera for a few weeks now, this little sucker still finds ways to surprise me!  I do not even know where to begin concerning all of the wonderful features of this beaut!

What first grabbed my attention with this camera was, of course, the design!  See how neato this thing looks?!  Minolta got the look from one of their earlier cameras, the Electro-Zoom X, the name telling you that it had to look cool!  The new design of the Z1 allows the camera to sit well in the hands of the user, allowing secure, steady handling.

As all of the other reviews have stated, the zoom of the Z1 is second to none in it's class!  The 4x digital is good, but when you see the 10x optical zoom of this camera, you will be swooned.  And the Super Macro setting allows the user close-up shots of subjects with great detail.

If one is looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera, then a cheaper camera will certainly be available, but for those searching for the ability to gain complete control over a photograph, while still allowing the camera to do the work at times, then search no more.  With different settings allowing you to control shutter speeds, aperture readings, and exposure levels, the outcome of the photograph can be completely left up to you.

The 1.5" LCD screen shows up great in low light, and in daytime usage, thanks to the manual setting for brightness.  An odd feature of this camera is the switch from LCD screen to the viewfinder.  There is no separate screen here, so the LCD screen sorta swings up to the viewfinder with the help of mirrors and other mystical incantations, taking the fun out of using the viewfinder for battery saving...but hey, that's ok, I just stick with using the 'ole LCD screen, works just perfect!

Again, as all reviews have already stated, the camera Is made of plastic, but don't get the idea that it is cheap feeling.  Minolta did a fine job of taking a plastic body and making it feel durable and 'important.'

Now there are a few parts of the camera that lean toward the 'plasticy' feel.  The battery cover feels as though it could snap off at any moment, and the zoom mechanism does wiggle a little bit, but seems to me that this is completely normal, and I did not give it a second thought.  And, of course, the stinkin lens cap...

The photo quality is amazing, and the superfast autofocus snags pics in no time, with no blurring or crazy color schemes.  Just today, I snagged a pic of a squirrel at full sprint, 50 feet away, and it came out magazine worthy!  Use the automatic camera settings for worry-free photography, or apply the other manual settings for ultimate control shots!

Well, I guess this wraps it up for me...I would not change my mind about this camera, and I would buy it again if I had the chance.  The 16MB card is inadequate, but a bigger one can be purchased quite easily, and they're so darn little!  I snagged my Z1 from Butterfly Photo for around $300, and I believe I got a snazzy deal, cause I've seen it advertised elsewhere for 400-500 bucks!

Okey dokey, glad I could offer any help for anyone in search of the 'grail' of digital cameras... the Z1 is not perfect, but dang if it does not come close!
