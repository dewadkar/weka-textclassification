            Our 1997 Honda Accord 4-door sedan was a crash course in Japanese engineering.  We had never owned a Japanese car before, and decided to take home an Accord.  It was an LX model with power locks, windows, tilt, cruise, a tape player, and manual seats; a low-frills people mover.

We had debated over a 1997 Toyota Camry LE, a 1998 Maxima, and this little Honda.  My wife did not like the looks of the Maxima, although it was my first choice.  The Camry was loaded up with $2500 worth of goodies over the Accord.  So, the homely little Honda came home with us.  Hindsight being 20/20, we should've brought home the Maxima.

The four cylinder was peppy for such a small engine, and could get the car moving.  The auto transmission shifted nicely, and the radio sounded great.  Despite the tiny motor, fuel economy was no better than my Thunderbird - usually 19-20 mpg in town.  On the highway, the Honda would get 30-31, but so can my Buick Roadmaster and it is FAR more comfortable than the Accord! 

Ride quality was, in my opinion, poor.  Now I know what riding in a Campbell's soup can feels like.  The car sat so low, you felt like your butt was dragging the ground.  Every bump reverberated up through the car and into my back.  I believe the seats were made from some type of rock or stone, with a thin fabric cover.  With only a manual recline lever, there was no way to get comfortable.

Rear seat leg room was about the same as our Mustang GT.  On a four door "family" sedan, that is not a good thing.  Headroom was ample, surpassing that of the 1996-99 Taurus.  Trunk space was adequate, yet it was no greater than that of my old Mercury Topaz.

Driving the car could be fun, so long as you didn't get run over by larger vehicles...a VW Beetle for instance.  The Accord definitely had what Mazda calls "zoom, zoom, zoom."  For a brief second, you can feel like a Formula 1 driver.  Then, the 18-wheeler nearly crushes you and you're jolted back to reality.

While we had no major problems, we did only own the car a short while.  Here is something you should DEFINITELY check out before buying an Accord.  SOME of the Accords have front disks that cannot be removed from the car.  So, when you go in to get a brake job and have the rotors turned, they have to use a special machine that fits the rotor while its still on the car.  That equals more money.  Not all are like that...make sure you know if yours is.

After 3 months, we'd had enough Japanese engineering and traded the frumpy little Honda.  I'd always wondered why people bragged about Accords so much.  I'm still wondering.
