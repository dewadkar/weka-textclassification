            The Chevy Camaro is one of those cars you don't buy if you're looking for great gas mileage, lots of room for the kids, and quiet.  This car growls at you.  Of course, the Camaro has been around forever, and one reason its been such a success is the power under the hood.  It has a V8 with more than 300 horsepower.  Platinum-tipped spark plugs enable you to go 100,000 miles before the first scheduled tune-up.  Acceleration is quick.  One problem is its very easy to slip gears.  The Camaro handles like the  muscle car you'd expect.  This car is great for driving around the neighborhood and showing off.  The Camaro is one of those cars you recognize the minute you see it.  Inside the cockpit, you'll find it equipped with everything you'd expect from a muscle car.  <br><br>
