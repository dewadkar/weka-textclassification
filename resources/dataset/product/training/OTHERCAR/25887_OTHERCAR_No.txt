            I bought a brand new Jeep Cherokee Sport in 1995.  I bought the Jeep based on it's long standing reputation as a &quot;hardy&quot; sports utility vehicle.

What I love about my Jeep:  I love the looks.  It's a &quot;hot&quot; red and the body style is great.  It also drives well over rough terrain.

The four things I hate about my Jeep: (1) The constant problems and recalls! (brake pads replaced 8 times, brake drums replaced once, air conditioner repairs, replacing engine mount bolts twice, exhaust manifold recall, air bag recall, seatbelt recall, interlock-shift recall, etc.). 

(2) I also do not like that the tailgate window does not open.  The only way to open the tailgate is to lift the entire door.  It is quite difficult to shut (heavy); especially, if your arms are full of groceries.  I also do not like that the interior light does not come on automatically when the two back doors and/or tailgate are open.

(3) I have not had good experiences dealing with customer service persons at the local Chrysler dealership nor with the corporate office.

(4) I also feel like the safety features are lacking:  Driver's-side airbag only (passenger side wasn't available);  the back seat does not stayed in the locked position and the back seat does not have raised head rests to protect against whip-lash;  the seat belts up front have never worked properly and sometimes do not lock when the brakes are applied hard.<br><br>
