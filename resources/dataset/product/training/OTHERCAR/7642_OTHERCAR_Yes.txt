            I got one of these bad boys a couple of years ago,  and I now all but live in it.   I'm no auto mechanic,  so I can't really talk about all those little technical things that so many people get caught up in,  but I can tell you why I love my truck.   

#1.   It's big, but not too big like the Suburban.  I can throw three bikes in back with gear and go to a race with friends without having to even put my bike rack on.   So many of these SUV's today have the look,  but somehow manage to just not have the space I would like to have.   The blocky design of the Yukon leaves plenty of space for all my gear. The other big advantage to having this much space is that it leaves plenty of room to put the seat down and sleep in the back.   I often go to races alone,  and have found that there is plenty of room to sleep back there even with my bike pushed off to the side,  and it is dryer than a tent to boot.    I just have to put my gear in the front seat.  

#2   Bucket seats-  just because they are better than the bench and you get a consul.  

#3  Great for winter driving in Maine.  The extra weigh and 4WD help enormously.

#4   It's a tank,  while I don't go mudding much,  it certainly is fun to go play every now and then.  

#5  It's  a GMC.    GMC make some of the most solid dependable cars on the market,  and this is no exception.   I have about 100,000 miles on this bad boy,  and I have had no major problems yet.  You just can't complain about that.  

The only drawback to driving a tank,  I mean Yukon, is the gas mileage.   I actually haven't stopped to figure it out in a while, I know this can suck down some gas,  and with gas prices going through the roof,  and oh yes the environment, there is a certain benefit to driving a small car.  But you can't beat the Yukon if you're the kind of person who often finds yourself on some crazy washboard dirt road heading off into the middle of nowhere to do something crazy.
