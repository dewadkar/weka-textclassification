             I bought mine (92 model) in 1997 with 67K on the odometer.
Before the purchase, my friend helped me to get the car checked out by a mechanic, who told us the car was in great shape. Previous owner took good care of the car and had all the maintenance records. I got the car for $10500, and since then, the car gave me trouble-free service (one visit to mechanic: water pump replacement). I did notice the replacement parts are expensive compared to American cars, though. 

 Car is quite comfortable, and stylish (gracious curves inside and out, definitely not one of those boxy cars).

 As for performance/handling, this car is great. Engine is smooth, rev-happy, and delivers quite a power on demand. (slight clicking noise from valves, on cold mornings). Car handles nicely, and it's quite a joy to drive this car through winding mountain roads. It comes with rear-wheel drive, and 50-50 weight distribution on the front and rear axles(like Miata). No parts have been replaced other than regular maintenance items such as break parts and belts.

 This car has comfy seats, and ride is smooth. Great highway cruiser. Positive comments from passengers again and again. 

 However, mine does have some small annoyances. 
1. On the rough roads (not off road), faint squeaky noise comes from interior trims.
2. For some reason, it has NO GLOVE COMPARTMENT.
(Oh, and no cup holders, either)
3. Headlights are a bit dim. Have to turn on fog lights on roads with no streetlights. Replacing light bulbs didn't help.

 But considering all the positive aspects of the car, I am quite happy with the purchase even after 3 years. It has comfort/ performance/ reliability /luxury without luxury price. Mazda designed 92 929 as the first car of their own luxury brand (Amati), then they somehow gave up the plan, and sold 929 with Mazda badge. Attentions to details are plentiful. (inner door handles are anti-static: no static electricity shock. Steering-wheel mounted audio control and cruise control, etc..) 

 929 would be a great choice for people who are looking for value and practicality. <br><br>
