            Lexus has often been criticized for  building cars that are �too perfect.�  Many have complained that Lexus cars isolate the driver from the road, and lack the sporting feel of other (usually European) sport sedans.  In some ways this may be true, the Lexus LS, for example, is a blatant knock-off of  a Mercedes-Benz, but Lexus has managed to build a better Mercedes than even Mercedes.  Lexus� GS line is certainly intended to appeal to those who would complain that Lexus� lack a soul. While the LS430 is about luxury, the GS430 is more about sport, with some luxury added.  Besides, what could possibly be sterile about a 300 hp V8, driving the rear wheels, and cloaked in a swoopy, if not unique looking sedan?

A standard features resume that�s as long as an 8 year old kid�s Christmas list seems only fitting, for after all, it is a Lexus. The term �loaded� never applied so aptly to a car. Features such as Homelink, stability and traction control (VSC), wood trim, 10-way power seats with memory, power tilt and telescoping wheel, water repelling side windows, and UV absorbing glass are only the beginning for the ultra luxurious GS430. A Mark Levinson stereo, leather, moon roof and GPS based navigation system are optional.

When all is said and done, it really comes down to what�s under the hood.  Lexus does not disappoint. Even the most entrenched American muscle devotee would have to be impressed with the GS430�s all aluminum, dual overhead cam, 4.3 liter, V8 that makes 300 hp and  325 lb-ft of torque.  0-60 time you ask? 5.8 seconds � that is no kidding around. All this power drives the rear wheels - and so it should.

The GS looks decidedly un-Japanese.  European in style, but Japanese in execution, the GS is a beautiful sedan.  The long, sleek and gradually rounded front has a certain Toyota quality to it, but the short, stubby rear deck and quick swoosh in the C pillar lend a sort of English quality  to the rear of the GS.  The trendy �tail lights in the trunk� effect is a bit much, but it does not mar an otherwise sleek and very attractive exterior.

Interior style matches that of the exterior, the sporting theme carries over nicely in to the cockpit. Large, round, backlit gages housed in their own separate (3 to be exact) pods gives the inside a racy feel. The abundant wood and chrome give a distinct Euro feel, but the overall feeling is much more inviting than any BMW or Audi.  There is a warmness to the inside of this car that makes it a very pleasant place to spend time.

Slide the key in the ignition slowly, give it a firm twist and� wow ! you can actually hear the exhaust. This is one of the many indications that, as Lexus clearly (and accurately) states in the press kit, this is ��not just (a) luxury car with stiffened suspension and big tires.�  Indeed, imagine a luxury car where you can actually hear the distant, yet pleasant purr of a small V8. 

Once under way, the sporting nature of this car becomes more obvious as it lacks the soft, cushy ride of many luxury sedans. Although cornering is not flat, the 225/55R16 Michelin Pilots really bite. The sticky tires combined with the VSC system make driving the GS430 hard a worry free experience. It takes a few passes to get used to the lack of front end push. Too much time in front-wheel drivers has tainted my perception.  Turn the VSC off, and you can get into trouble. For the record, yes, the 430 will smoke the rear tires � 300 hp has a way of doing that.

Ride quality around town is a bit on the stiff side, but nothing a person who enjoys driving would not expect from such a car.  Acceleration is brisk, and the torque is most noticeable when launching from a full stop.  Engine noise is minimal, but under full throttle there is a bit more mechanical sound. Lexus has done a great job of making a powerful engine refined as well.  Compared to Audi�s small V8, the 4.3 in the Lexus is downright quiet.  In fact, at times I actually wished for a little more engine noise. 

Lexus is trying to split the line between luxury and sport, and in some cases the GS seems to exhibit one more than the other. A perfect example is interior noise, while the buttery smooth V8 is barely audible at times, the road noise that results from the aggressive Michelin radials is almost too much in certain conditions.  Rough roads and expansion joints thump into the cabin like there�s no tomorrow.   

The interior is well appointed, and the bucket seats are very comfortable. There is a purposeful cockpit feel which may feel a bit cramped for larger people. Once you get the driver�s seat adjusted just perfectly, there is this overwhelming feeling that sets in after about an hour of driving � �this is my car� the little voice inside your head says. �This car fits me perfectly, I�ve been waiting for a car that fits me like this.� I drive a lot of cars each year, and I can honestly say I was very sorry to see this one go. I wasn�t sorry to see the $70,000 Jaguar XJ8 go, and I wasn�t sorry to see the $55,000 Lincoln Blackwood go. The GS will be missed. 

It�s the little things, like one touch up and down for all four windows, a memory seat that also adjusts the outside mirrors and the steering wheel, and an incredible audio system. An audio system that I can�t even bring myself to call a car stereo, an audio system that is the best I have ever heard in any car, EVER !! And frankly better than 90% of the home systems I�ve heard.

The optional Mark Levinson stereo and the navigation system combined add $5,700 to the price of the car. I know, I know, it�s outrageous and I am the biggest cheapskate alive. BUT�. If you enjoy music of any kind, you must, must, must hear this awesome stereo.  
Granted, eight speakers doesn�t seem like much on paper, but the speakers are positioned in such a way as to let everyone in the car enjoy the same high quality sound. There is a center channel speaker on the dashboard which angles up and toward the front so that the sound is bounced off the windshield. Pop in a CD you�ve been listening to for a few years and it�s almost a guarantee that you�ll hear notes, sound effects and background noise you�ve never heard before.  The Audi Symphony/Bose system is also good, but this Mark Levinson system is simply the best. This stereo is so good it almost out-shines the rest of the car. 

 Although sound quality is second to none, the stereo does have its one shortcoming. The CD changer is in the glove box � bravo to Lexus for �getting it� in that area, getting out of the car to change CDs in a luxury car is unacceptable. The problem is that the CD changer uses a magazine with little flimsy trays that hold each CD up side down.  The trays can come all the way out (even when you might not want them to) and they are difficult to get back in just right.  It�s a small gripe, but even the aging Mazda Millenia has an in-dash CD changer. Perhaps the nav system forces that option out.

ps, recommended CDs to appreciate the stereo: The Corrs Unplugged, Weezer's Pinkerton, Pixies' Surfer Rosa, Plumb's Candy Coated Waterdrops, and Audio Adrenaline's Greatest Hits; that bass HITS !!)

When optioned with the navigation system, the audio controls are incorporated into the touch screen. Both the audio controls and the navigation system are easy to use, and simple to understand. Each function of the GPS navigation system is very intuitive in its operation. Planning a route, or seeking turn by turn guidance is easy and rarely requires a visit to the owner�s manual.  The touch screen is in color, and boasts some of the most useful features of any in-car navigation system.  For example, when planning a trip, the screen will ask you if you�d like the shortest route, fastest route, or a route that avoids all highways and/or toll roads � incredible! Also very helpful is the feature that highlights a turn or on-ramp in the right 1/3 of the screen. As you approach a complex intersection, the full map will squeeze to the left, then show a larger, up-close detail of the intersection with your intended route clearly marked. If you make a wrong turn, or think you know a better way than the computer, simply press a button and the navigation system will re-figure how to best get you to your final destination from your new position.

Overall the Lexus GS430 is a much better than average performance sedan. The tight V8 is packed full of power and runs like a Swiss watch. Handling is crisp without sacrificing too much ride comfort, and the luxury features abound. This is a really good $43,000 car. But the 430 is priced closer to $47,000 � still it�s a good car for that kind of money. Add some options such as the navigation system, leather, sunroof, chrome wheels and the killer audio system, add these features and the price can easily climb to just over $55,000. That is a lot of money, and you�ll get a lot of car for that money, but one can�t help but wonder why not just step up to the LS430 for that kind of dough?  The GS is much more sport than luxury, but if you want to save some money, knock off the extras or go for the GS300. The 300 has a straight-six and lacks some of the 430�s luxury touches.  Still, is there any substitute for a 300 hp V8?  Didn�t think so.
