            I've been in alot of Saturns in the last few years (turns out that alot of people I know are buying them) so it would seem to make perfect sense that I would eventually start dating a guy with one. He bought it used from a dealership, but they still treat it like a new car. We take it in to get the oil changes done regularly and any other maintanance (I'm a bit of a hard driver).
I learned how to drive on this car and really tested it during a blizzard last winter on side streets. i could always feel when the wheels were starting to slip and it corrected easily. It's not the car's fault. The old monster of a car that was following behind to make sure that I made it okay was having a worse time and he had been driving for years.
Now I have my license and take the car everywhere. As I have a job that requires me to travel alot, I can put 300-400 kms on it in a weekend. I normally have alot of weight in it from taking 4 or 5 large guys with me, but it still can go. I travel the highways alot and it still can at least keep up with the boss's Mustang.
when I have to work in the city I still do alot of driving, traveling from site to site at night, when there's alot of dangerous drivers. It can manouver quickly to avoid an accident (and the dent resistant panels are amazing) and it can acceleate quickly if needed.
I don't know how powerful the engine is or any of the technical stuff, but I know it's a good car that loves to go. It's happiest on the higway, but quite content to do a 12 hour shift with me in the city.
as I said i'm a bit hard on it, but we haven't really had a problem yet. Okay, so we had to get the front brakes replaced, but it's partially my fault and also it's at almost 200,000 kms. The dealership made me feel at ease too, so that was just a bonus. And they wash your car for you after!
If I have to stop suddenly, it lets me. I've had to pulld some pretty quick stops and then run out of the car (it's a dangerous job) and it's okay if I run it rough.
The gas lasts forever and I can fill it for $20 Canadian.
The back seat isn't the roomiest for the nig guys, but you can pull up the seats. I've managed to fit four people in the back. The front seats are comfortable, but I don't really like the fabric texture, it's a little rough when you're wearing shorts.
All in all, it's a great car and I can't wait to own one of my own soon.
I just wish he'd gotten the CD player for the radio, not just the cassette...
