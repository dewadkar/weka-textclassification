            I don't think they get any better than this.  This is the greatest camera.  It has the built in flash, automatic focus, love the zoom.  The zoom feature is great because I take pictures for auctions.  And when I am taking a picture of clothing I stand above it.  A lot of time I may get my shadow on the photo.  With this camera I can zoom in and not have that shadow and get a close up of the outfit.  
The built in flash practically guarantees a perfect picture every time.
Now to the special video feature.  This camera takes video clips as well.
Oh my gosh, it has been so special to send a video clip of our three year old to family and friends over the Internet.  It plays very easily on Windows Video player.  No need to install any special software.
I did not have to install any software for any feature of this camera.  You just put a 3.5 inch floppy disk in the side and it is ready to take pictures.
This is the best camera.  I recommend it to everyone as THE CAMERA to have.<br><br>
