            BMW offers its customers something more satisfying than the right car at the right price. This company's automobiles have a racing tradition. It currently dominates big-time endurance racing (BMW won this year's 24 Hours of Le Mans) and is wading into Formula One next year.
The 3-Series coupe mirrors the styling of the sedan. The windshield is slightly more raked and the car is lower, due in part to the coupe's standard, half-inch-lower sport suspension. And while there is no sheet metal shared between sedan and coupe, the subtle differences are a test of one's observational abilities. 
Like the sedan, the coupe is available with in-line sixes of either 2.5 liters and 170 horsepower, or 2.8 liters with 193 horses (the 323Ci and 328Ci, respectively). Either of these all-aluminum motors produce abundant torque with oily smoothness and a symphonic exhaust note. In second gear -- the around-town gear, if you will -- the car surges as if pulled by a snapping rubber band from low revs through the red line. The 323Ci offers sparkling acceleration, with 0-to-60 m.p.h. times of about 7 seconds. 
Much of the equipment that came with the sedan's optional Sport package is standard in the coupe. Larger alloy wheels and tires (16 by 7 inch) are standard; 17-inch tires and sport seats are available with the coupe's sport package.
BMW's front-strut, rear multilink suspensions are unsurpassed. The moment you put your hands on the three-spoke steering wheel, you become one with the car. For pure driving pleasure, I think the 3-Series coupe handling beats the smaller and faster -- and twitchy -- M Roadster. 
With this in mind, I recommend the 323Ci without any reservations.
