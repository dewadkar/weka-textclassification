            Aiptek Pocket Cam 3mega
I have tried out this camera on a sale or return basis and compared it with a cheap 0.3mp camera and the Fuji FinePix2800. I was considering it as a present.
In summary I would say that the Aiptek is far superior to the 0.3mp pocket cameras as they are only just useful for small pictures on web pages.  The Finepix 2800 however has high quality pictures in still mode, excellent macro and close up features as well as a reasonably easy to use menu system. So this new camera was always going to be given a good run for its money.

By comparison the Aiptek has only a poor close up facility so don't try to take pictures of your prize flowers as single heads.  Its closest view was about 45cm.  When trying to photograph documents it just did not achieve the resolution to make an A4 or A5 document readable.  The Fuji had no problem with anything down to the size of a large postage stamp.  One problem with the Aiptek is the burn out when using the flash on fairly close range objects.

The Aiptek has three resolutions 1mp, 2mp and 3mp.  When shooting a 30x25cm picture that filled the frame the Aiptek produced only a mediocre quality picture even at 3mp, with or without the flash.  The Fuji did an excellent job, despite working at only 1mp.

Long and middle range views in good light were fine.

The movie mode on the Aiptek produced a clearer image than the Fuji with a truer balance for artificial light.  

Although the Aiptek uses the faster compact flash cards to store images the need to use this camera in the 3mp mode means that it still takes several seconds to make the camera available to shoot, especially if using the flash as well.

The Aiptek menu system is very straightforward and should not take long to learn.

Power is supplied by 2 AA alkaline batteries that come with the camera.

The standard memory card is 16mb but I would always recommend at least 64mb.

The camera is quite a handy size and, being the size of many mobile phones, will fit into the pocket or handbag.

The zoom lens is only 3x.  I soon missed the 6x optical zoom of my Fuji. Also the zoom mode was disabled while using the movie mode and there is no sound with picture, unlike the Finepix.

The viewfinder is like to old compact cameras - i.e. it has the same problem with parallax.  Whilst this makes it clearer than the Fuji's electronic version it does make it harder to frame the picture accurately.

The viewfinder on the back is only slightly smaller than that of the Fuji.  It is large enough and bright enough to operate effectively in most lighting conditions.  It is a little harder in very bright sun but that is common to many other viewing panels on other cameras.

Overall I will return my review model and go back to my good old Finepix 2800. This Aiptek is easy to use and a handy size but does not seem to be good value to me and the resolution is well below what I would have expected for 3mp.
