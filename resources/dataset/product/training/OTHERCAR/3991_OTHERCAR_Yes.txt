            When my wife's lease was up on her Nissan Sentra (which i will not recommend to anyone) we started looking for a larger family car.  We considered the Accord, Camry and the Passat.  Didn't even think of Saturn...they don't make a larger car do they?  It wasn't until the car show arrived that our ideal car would appear.  As we walked around to all the different makers, we spotted it! After inspecting the LS1 they had on display, fiddling with all the gadgets, looking at the size of the trunk, and discussing with another couple who we surprised as well!

That was a Thursday night, I emailed the local Saturn dealer on Friday and arranged a test drive (all via email) for that Saturday.  We met the salesperson and he explained the 'Saturn way' to us.  Explained everything about the car, luckily there was an LS2 inside as it was raining outside.  It didn't take us long to make up our minds that this was our next car!  What can you not like about it.  We got the LS2 with every option available, V-6, leather, spoiler, in the grey color.  Had them tint the windows which further enhanced the sleek look of the LS2.  For the money we got the most car possible. We have owned the car since the last of November and mostly used it for commuting but can't wait to take it on a road trip this summer.  

The front seats are comfortable, and the heated seats are nice on the cold mornings.  Plenty of legroom (I am 6'3&quot;) in both the front and back seat.  Stereo is good, layout is nice.  Only two complaints those, actually one is a suggestion for future Saturns.  First, the gas and brake pedals are too close together.  The first couple of times i drove the car i accidently hit the brake when trying to merge with traffic.  ONe complaint is we have an annoying rattle coming from the accent strip around the stereo.  Other than that the interior is great.  Very quiet ride and the power from the V-6 is exceptional.  You can pass anyone at 70mph.  Repeatedly been going 80 without realizing!

If you are looking for a new family size car then i would recommend the LS2 with the V-6.<br><br>
