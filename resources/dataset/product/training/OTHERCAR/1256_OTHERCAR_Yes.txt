            In trying not to make a same mistake twice, I waited almost two years before making the decision to buy my second digital camera.  I read all available articles I could find about all digital cameras and narrowed it down to Coolpix 950, but it did not have a USB connection, so I patiently waited, knowing they will eventually make it... and they did.  The Coolpix 990 is the improved version of 950.  I suppose I could wait longer to get a better product cheaper, but I had to draw a line somewhere.  So, I ordered 990.

Did I make a right decision choosing 990?  Yes... but, I can tell right now that this is not for everyone.  In order to fully enjoy this camera, there are two prerequisites; one, you must reasonably know all the basics of photography.  And two, you will have to be able to use a computer.  Sure, anyone can learn these if patient enough.  However, without these two prerequisites, most will either regret for spending extra dollars for nothing, or will get frustrated each time using it.  If you are a �point and shoot� type of person, then you might be better off getting a less expensive camera with less control.  The Coolpix 990 has a fully automatic setting option, but the reason this camera costs more than others is probably because of all the manual controls available in addition to the fully automatic setting.  Read on.

I skimmed through the manual and tried to use the camera at first.  Since many functions are hidden under menu system, it was at first very difficult to navigate through seemingly hundreds of options to find what I wanted.  For example, it annoyed me greatly when the camera continuously �auto focused� every time I moved the camera.  It was not until I found where in the menu that I could disable the auto focus function.  The instruction manual came in the box explained that, but it took a while to get used to know how the camera�s menu system was organized.  I also found a menu item to disable my flash since I like taking photos in natural lighting condition if possible.  It took 5 minutes of thumbing through the instruction manual to undo this function when a flash was really needed, and needless to say I missed the shot.  There are countless examples of this, but everyone�s preferences should be different so I won�t get into too many details.  Here�s what I like and dislike...

I very seldom (almost never) use �fully auto� setting.  I guess this is why I did not consider �point and shoot� cameras.  990�s manual / semi auto controls have more features than I originally thought I was getting, and this is the best part of 990.  As I mentioned earlier, a basic knowledge of photography is mandatory when using manual functions.  Features that I like the most are spot metering and focusing.  Being able to change ISO equivalent settings (ASA 100 to 400 and Auto) for indoor photography without flash is also a big plus.  All this nice features come with a frustration of finding them in the menu driven system.  Even with LCD displayed information, there are just too many icons and symbols to check to make sure my setting is what I want at the time of shooting.  A month or two of practice should solve the problem, and one of the beauty of digital cameras is that I can always delete the picture I don�t want to keep without costing a penny.  It would be wonderful if there are mechanical knobs to set aperture and shutter speed instead of digital readouts.  Under the poor lighting condition, auto focusing becomes almost impossible, forcing for true manual mode.  However, manual focusing on this camera is all guess work as you set the distance before taking pictures.  A split screen or range finder should be Nikon�s next improvement goal.

My true complain about 990 is its shutter.  According to the instruction manual, pressing the shutter button halfway locks in on focus, but I find it very difficult to judge when the halfway point is reached.  I find myself pressing the shutter speed all the way in when I meant to press it the halfway.  Again, time will tell if this is something I could get used to.

I don�t need to reiterate what others have said about its beautiful picture quality.  While other 2 or 3 mega pixel cameras take as good a picture as the 990 under ideal lighting conditions, only a handful can manipulate through difficult lighting conditions.  Again this requires some photographical knowledge to take advantage of built-in functions.

Transferring images to computer is easily done through bundled program package.  But there are no written manuals, so your computer knowledge is a must.  It worked fine on my Windows 98, but not with Windows ME.  I am still trying to work with Nikon tech support to get it running on ME.  If your TV has a video input, then pictures could be viewed on TV with a supplied cable.  

For photo hobbyists... without getting into the true professional quality digital cameras at thousands of dollars more, 990 is just about as good as it is going to get. (Hum... that�s what I used to say with my first digital camera two years ago!)

First update (2/24/01)- After using it more than a month taking hundreds of pictures, here's my updated comments... I have successfully downloaded the program for my Windows ME and transferring pictures to the computer is no longer a problem.  I am now somewhat familiar with all functions available with the camera, however, it hasn't gotten any easier checking a dozen or so available on screen icons.  I still forget time to time, to change settings such as ISO and White Balance.  Focusing is still my biggest problem. While I now have the full control of "half way" focus lock, it seems the camera has problem focusing especially under low lighting condition. Another option I miss is the "in-between" photo quality between high (3 mega pixel) and XGA (slightly less than 1 mega pixel).  The high setting is awesome, but it takes too much memory, and XGA setting is great for 4x6 size, but not "conventional picture quality" at 8x10.  VGA is alright for emailing.  In-between setting of 2 mega pixel would've been useful.  This is another reason that 3 mega pixel cameras could be an overkill for many people.  But, when you want something, you just got to have it!
