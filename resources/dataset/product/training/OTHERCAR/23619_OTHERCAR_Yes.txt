              When an SUV is mentioned, the Jeep Corporation is usually the example given.  Jeep has a long and reputible reputation for producing some of the most solid and well built sport utility vehicles out on the market today. I have owned the Jeep Cherokee Sport I will be reviewing for about 3 years now. My opinions are non biased. I will not argue for or against American or import cars.  I know how both drive and feel.
  The Jeep Cherokee is a normal looking car. There are other more &quot;flashier&quot; cars out on the market today, but how many of them can go off road and not be in a bind?  The Jeep's powerful 4 liter engine gives it enough torque, power, and pulling power to do most, if not all, of the tasks required for today's world. I have pulled alot of people out of ditches with my jeep a many a times in the snow.  The &quot;go anywhere&quot; jeep can be used for off roading and as an &quot;urban assault vehicle&quot;.  Plenty of cargo room is in the Jeep and it can also set five people, although I have had as many as 8 in there at one time.  Its large gauges on the dashboard and east to read instrument panel makes it easy too look at while driving.
  There are also some aspects I do not care for.  First and foremost I must mention its extremly bumpy ride. This is useful for off road situations but not to likeable in real world situations. Leg room is also questionable. This car is not really great for tall fellows such as myself (6'6). Speaker placement can be better if the the Jeep Corporation raised the speakers a little more. Like all SUVs, the Jeep does not handle well around very large turns. The cost for great power is not to perfect gas mileage. Many imports have far better gas mileage than the Jeep Cherokee.
All in all i recommend the Jeep Cherokee to anyone who has a family and does not want to drive a minivan or a station wagon. You can still look cool while driving your kids to soccer practice.<br><br>
