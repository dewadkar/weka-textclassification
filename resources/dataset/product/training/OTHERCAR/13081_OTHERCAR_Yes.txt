            I have worked in the Best Buy Digital Imaging (Camera) Department now for about 8 months and finally bought my first digital camera and I am extremely happy I waited.  I was never truly convinced about digital quality unless you purchase a 4 or 5 megapixel and even though something about it rubbed me the wrong way.  So I did everything to avoid it for awhile.  I bought the Canon Rebel Ti (SLR) with 300mm lens for photography and traveling instead of a digital...  But recently after a trip that resulted in developing 12 rolls of film but only liking about 2 total rolls of the photos i decided i should go digital.  And was only more encouraged when i went to have reprints made from negatives for friends and paid 50 cents a print!
So after reviewing a lot of the cameras i sell everyday I had it narrowed down to the Canon S50, Sony F717, and the Olympus C50...  I wanted the Sony F717 but not the size of the camera.. so i researched and discovered the V1 was soon to be out.  I  was very excited and waited for it to arrive at Best Buy.
I have only had the camera now for about 3 days but absolutely LOVE it.  Sincerely, it is the BEST digital out in stores.  The colors (in part to the 5megapixel quality) are truly amazing.  as soon as a take a batch of photos, i hook it up to the tv with the av cable and zoom, crop and edit a little bit to get a good look at how they turned out, and it is truly awesome..  i printed out a bunch of 8x10s of flowers i took in macro and the quality is outstanding, even when the photo is cropped, magnified and printed in 8x10 size... you can see all the veins and pollen specles of the flower.
There is so much you can grow into with the camera also.. it is surely loaded for a great little size...  i love the 800 speed for action shots and low light situations... the only other one that has this is the sony 717... even the canon G3 only has 400 speed.  Night SHot is unique to Sony but does work for anyone that camps or wildlife at night.
I could go on and on about the quality and versatility of this new camera but i won't :)   Most people looking into the cybershot series will probably look at the P8, P10, and P92... but the extra bit to go to the V1 is definately worth it... don't get anything less than a 5 megapixel or you'll regret investing the money into a 3 megapixel that is outdated next year and poorer quality than the 5.  plus the V1 has a larger Carl Ziess Lens, definately worth it...  Even if your not a big photography buff, the V1 is still the way to go.  Buy it and ENJOY it!!  You will have lots of fun and be amazed at the quality of the photos!!  I had all mine in the basic green auto mode and they turned out so awesome that no one believed i took them... and all i did was point and shoot!  The Sony F717 in a lot smaller size!  WORTH THE MONEY! GET THE V1!
