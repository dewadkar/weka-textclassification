            This has got to be the worst camera available. I have returned 2 camera's to RCA because I could not get a refund. I am on my third camera and it still has a problem. 
Problems:
(1) The case cracks by the battery cover. The locking mechanism applies too much pressure when locked and it WILL crack. I sent my first camera back partly because of this. The referbished camera that I received was already cracked when I received it. 
(2) The camera has problems with the electronics. Sometimes the camera will work for about 20 minutes then it will lock-up. You can change batteries, try different settings but it will not work. Then it will work again for a short period. 
(3) RCA (Thomson) will not stand behind their product. We are on our third attemp with this camera, but when contacting the service department were told that we would have to write a letter to the "review board" to see if they would aprove a refund.
(4) Office Max knew that the camera's were bad. I bought the camera for my wife for Christmas when I first saw the ad at Office Max. When I went back two weeks latter to inquire about one for a friend I was told they were out of stock and they would not be getting anymore and it was probably a good thing because they had alot of returns on the cameras.
If you want to throw away your money on a camera then buy this one. It does take excellent pictures when it works, but in the long run you will be sorry.
