                 I bought a 1990 Geo Metro for $1600 back in 1997 and still own it!  I bought it with about 80,000 miles and it is still running with 136,000!  The car has been so reliable for me that I signed up with this site just to give it a good report.  It is a great car for in-town driving.  It has get-up-and-go plus it's great on gas mileage.  However, installing air conditioning may zap the zip because it only runs on three cylinders.  It's a little bit like driving a go cart, which is why it is so fun to drive. Since I have had it I have changed the brakes, timing belt, the tires, ignition coil, battery, plus regular changes such as spark plugs, air filter, wipers, muffler, and oil.  But on a used car with 80,000, some work was necessary.  Still, I went through college with this car.  Often my roommates would look in disgust at my car because it looked like it should break down, but rarely did so.  They took their nicer-looking cars to the shop far more frequently.  

     However, I would not recommend this car to someone with children for the obvious reason of safety.  Although it has heavy doors, it is still very compact.  The little Geo will most likely not survive a major collision with a majority of the rather large cars on the road.  Still, it is really fun to drive around, especially if you just want something quick, dependable, and cheap.
