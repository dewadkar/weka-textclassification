            Two weeks ago we took delivery of a 2003 Tribute with just the options we wanted, then took a 3000 mile trip through the mountains.  The car was fun to drive, handled well and seemed to have no bad habits. My only problem is with creature comforts. The adjustable steering wheel does not tilt, it simply moves one and one half inches up - with no change in angle. I was used to GM or Jeep products where I could adjust the wheel around me with a true tilt feature.  The other thing I disliked - when you exit the passenger door, you have no provision to lock the car (you can only lock YOUR door).  Then next, I discovered that you cannot get into any door except the drivers with a key. The driver would have a "keyless entry feature" but that is no help to a passenger.  How many other vehicles have doors without keyholes?? Over our 3000 miles we averaged 20.5 mpg, and that included nearly 1000 miles in the mountains. We got the premium sound system, and love it. My major dislike is the fact that in this electronic age, I cannot control where the A/C blows. The air cannot be directed from dash or low in the cabin. It is either in the regular air configuration or in the re-circulate mode, but the air blows from where the factory engineers decided it should blow from.  I like the trailer hitch with built in light connector.  I dislike the small spare tire, and hope it is never needed.
