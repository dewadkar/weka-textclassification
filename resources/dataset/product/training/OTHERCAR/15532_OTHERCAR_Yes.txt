            I just purchased a Sebring JXi and love it.  I also love the price that I was able to get on this car.  Since this car is very popular with the rental car agencies, you can get a great deal on these cars when they are one model year old.  In the fall of the year through the early winter, the previous years model is sent to local auctions as they bring in the new cars.  Since most people don't think convertible in the winter, these cars sell for much less than they do in the Spring and Summer.  I purchased a loaded JXi with on 20K miles for $17,200.  The asking price was around $19,995 to $21,000 for most of these cars, but all dealers where willing to drop below 18K.  All it takes is a little effort (calling many dealers and comparing prices and letting them know the best deal you have so far and challenging them to beat it).  My dealer finally agreed to let me go with him to the Auction site to look over what was coming up the next day. ***VERY IMPORTANT***make sure it is the Chrysler Auction*** This is where the cars that were used as rental will come through.  Any other auction, who knows what you will get.  Agree to give them $500 over their purchase price from the auction and most will allow that.  Especially if you show them that you are seriously shopping and comparing prices. Also, buying at the end of the month is always helpful.  This is a time when the dealership is trying to reach quotas and often gets bonus money.<br><br>
