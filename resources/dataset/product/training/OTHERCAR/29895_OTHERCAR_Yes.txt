            November 24, 2003! Ok folks here it is 3 years later and guess what? I still have this camera and I still use it! It's beat to heck and I've had to tape the battery cover many times to keep them in but it still works and it still takes great pictures. I was just at Fry's and saw that Mustek is still going strong too and they have a new line of cameras called GSmart. I will be getting the 3 megapixel model. So I am hoping the new Mustek will last as long as the VDC-300 which has given me 4 years of faithful service and has taken much abuse! But it's still going and even though the resolution is tiny by todays standards it's still good for taking shots for the web and as a webcam!

See below for my original epinion from 3 years ago.

November 27, 2000 &gt;&gt; I got my VDC-300 for $129 at Fry's electronics last year. It was a refurbished unit but for the price I figured I could not lose. I was right! The camera comes with 2meg of Internal Flash memory and you can insert a Compact Flash card in and take as many pics as you can. 

The resolution is not up there with the high end megapixel cams but is fine for everyday use. It has 3 modes, HQ, Normal and Economy. It has a small color display you can preview your pics. It also has USB connection, Serial connection and a hookup to view your pics right on your TV. 

I took it to Vegas and boy did it get abused. First off I dropped it several times but it just bounced back. My friend jammed the CF card in the wrong way and broke a small plastic piece inside but once I put the card back in the right way it worked! 

Then at home I dropped it more and I just have been generally pretty rough on the camera. The battery door broke off in one particularly hard fall onto cement. A bit of electrical tape fixed that. The camera was left in the rain for a day but once dried out worked again! 

I have now had it now for about a year and even though I just bought a (fragile looking) new megapixel camera, I still use my VDC-300. Yep with it's USB connection it makes a perfect web cam. So even thought it's too scratched up, banged and scarred for me to take it in public anymore it will sit on my pc and stay useful as I videoconference away!
