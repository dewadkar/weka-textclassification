            This car first came out for the model year 2000. I was deciding to either get the Celica GTS or the Honda Prelude. I ended up getting the Honda Prelude. Yes, I love my Prelude but thats a different story. Lets talk bout the Celica.

My brother ended up getting the Celica GTS in the year 2002, and I took it for spins a couple of times, and i was impress. With this car having 180 horsepower it's pretty quick compare to my Prelude with 200 horsepower.  The Celica is a lot lighter then the Prelude, so with 20 lesser horsepower, the Celica GTS could pretty much keep up with my car. It would be head by head until we get to 3rd gear or so becuase of the much more torque i have on my car.

What I like about this Celica GTS better then the Prelude is the 6th gear. With the extra gear it saves a lot of gas without having to bring the rpm so high while driving on the freeways.  My dislikes of the car is the interior. The roof looks like it's made of cardboard and the side panels is just some kind of hard plastic or something that gets scratch easily. Also because of the center console, it goes all the way to the backseat so it's hard for people to get in and out of the back of the driver seat if the driver doesn't allow people to come in and out of their side. The best thing about the interior is the stock stereo system. It's pretty good considering just being stock. It comes with 8 speakers. Yes i said 8, kind of weird though. It has 2 tweeters in the front, 2 speakers in the back, then 2 speakers on the doors, and the weird part is another 2 on top of the two on the doors.

Gas mileage for this car is pretty decent. It's a pretty fun driving car, so don't get tempted too much to take it fast or gas mileage will be horrible. Buying the Celica GTS requires you to get the premium gas, no cheap gas or you would mess up the engine.

Since the Honda Prelude is no longer being made anymore, I would recommend this car to people who is looking for a sport compact. But don't even think about buying the standard Celica GT model because that one isn't worth it. The Celica GT model compares more to a Honda Civic, which has no power at all what so ever.
