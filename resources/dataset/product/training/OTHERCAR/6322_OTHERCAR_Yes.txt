            I have owned my Dodge Avenger now for almost four years,,,and am still in the process to this day 10-29-99 getting new stuff for it and thinking of just some excuses to go out and drive her. It has an awesome smooth ride with quick acceleration (V-6). Do a few bolt-on mods and you already got around 200 HP! Not to mention this thing is a head turner. Go test drive one today,,,I make a bet that It will be sitting in your garage after that!<br><br>
