            I bought this sleek stylish digital camera almost a year ago when it was probably one of the top of the line models. One reason I purchased it was because I heard it takes crisp photos unlike some other cameras I won't mention. And of course the digital still photos don't compare to the &quot;point and shot&quot; 35mm cameras but I think that this camera will save you a buck or two in the long run for film.

Now I'm not going to mention any of that resolution junk because I really don't understand most of it and I really don't think most people looking to get a digital camera does either. I'll say that this camera features a 2-inch color LCD screen with allows previewing your pictures. It also has a 3X optical zoom lens. And allows 1.9 million pixels which I think means that theres 1900000 little dots of color in the picture that improves it. And I can also tell you that the camera has a clever software which is called, &quot;PhotoGenie&quot; that yields an even higher resolution. Which then adds up to what I like to call, &quot;SUPER-MEGA-CAMERA-IMAGE-SHOT.&quot; 

Must people complain about how this camera eats batteries and such. But the truth is that if your camera supports a LCD then is bound to waste batteries. You probably can't find a digital camera on the market that actually doesn't &quot;waste&quot; batteries.

I'd like to say this this is an amazing camera, even if you don't know how to use it, its fun to show off to your friends. Its a fairly slim, and has a silver body accentuated by a protruding black lens that can swivel as much as 280 degrees for flexible shooting.

In my opinion, (which is this) this camera is pretty easy to use. The bottom line is you press the button. Wait a second. You got your bright crisp color picture. 

Oh?
You don't like the picture? 
Just delete it off the 4mb flash card with a click of a button.

Q: Just one click to delete an image?

A: Sorry, a few easy clicks to delete an image.


Overall this is an easy to use camera and is worth your 500 dollars.
I recommend it to anyone with 500 dollars.<br><br>
