               I love my Saturn SL. When I bought my car, the sales people were amazingly nice, attentive, and respectful. When I needed body work done, they were amazingly caring and cooperative. Saturn has the best people in the business. 
    Aside from the people, their product is amazing. I love my Standard Transmission, and it is great to drive. I have always appreciated my dent resistant side panels and bumpers (and how they handle stray shopping carts and occasional golf balls), but last Monday, I began worshipping them. I was stopped at a light, attempting to make a right turn onto a
main street in rush hour traffic when a car rear ended me going about 20 miles per hour. I was at a dead stop and I slammed against my steering wheel and I was sure that I no longer had a trunk. I pulled into the next parking lot with my attacker right behind me, and there wasn't a scratch on the car, not one dent. I was so happy, I hugged the guy. Like I said, I now worship my bumpers. I have holy water and everything ;)
    Another thing that gets me is my gas mileage. I go so far on my gas money (partially to my Standard Transmission) that I only pay $10 for my tank of gas (not with recent gas prices, however) and I can drive on that tank for a good week before stooping again. I occasionally drive a Dodge Caravan that takes twice the money to fill and takes half the time to run dry. 
    The value of my car is also amazing. I got all the bells and whistles that I wanted and for a meager price. I also have a trunk that can hold 5 peoples bags for a road trip from Texas to Missouri, with room for Christmas Presents, plus those five people. I have the CD player, power everything, leather seats, and a sun roof. 
    I will never own another car, I may go though some Saturns in my life, but this is the car for me.<br><br>
