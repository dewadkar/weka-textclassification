            I purchased my Saturn about a year ago.  I love the sporty look I get, its silver with dark blue interior.  It has all the extra options and I love the cruise control which is set on the front of the steering wheel.  Usually I think 2 doors are more sporty looking than 4 doors, but not in my Saturns case.  Its a four door, which makes it great with my kids getting in an out constantly for their football games, soccer games, gymnastics and dance.  Its so roomy, I can haul my kids friends around with lots of room to spare.  


I prefer automatic over manual, and my Saturn just happens to be automatic.   It handles curves great and has a high performance switch for steep hills or inclines.  By using the high performance switch I also save on gas! 


I paid 3900.00 for my Saturn. I've only had to take it to the shop one time when my starter went out.


I love my Saturn and highly recommend this vehicle to anyone!
