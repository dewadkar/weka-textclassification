            This is without a doubt the Lexus with the most character, in my humble opinion.  Most Lexus' <i>(Lexi?)</i> are designed (IMHO) for people who hate driving.  If you want road feel, look to BMW, Jaguar or Infiniti, as most Lexus products are so completely devoid of any steering-wheel or seat-of-the-pants feedback from the surface of the road as to seem almost eerie in nature.

As some of you may have realized by now, I am not a major Lexus fan.  This does not mean they are bad cars -quite the opposite, in fact.  Lexus really does make a very high-quality automobile.  Primarily, the reason I am not a fan of Lexus products is that I think they are overpriced.  I won't go into the specifics here, but this is my general opinion of the brand.

Disclaimers aside, now we can return to the subject at hand: the Lexus SC coupes.  Ladies and gentlemen, these are two of the finest automobiles made.  The SC is a Lexus in every way (smooth, quiet, luxurious and well-made), but it offers something else which I find conspicuously absent from the majority of Lexus products: character.  Floor the pedal in either car and hold on -these cars are quick.  Of course, I love the silky-smooth power the 4.0 liter V8 in the SC400 provides, but the shift-it-yourself SC300 is my first choice for pure enthusiastic driving entertainment.

The Japanese versions of these cars (the SC is called the Toyota Soarer in Japan) offer lots of gizmos and gadgets that are sadly unavailable here in the US.  My favorite is the rear-view camera mounted under the small rear (trunk-mounted) spoiler.  Of course, the (rare) turbocharged Soarer (think Supra Turbo) is the ultimate toy, but I digress...

Take a seat inside either SC (300 or 400) and you could swear you were in your favorite comfy leather armchair.  The seats are really that comfortable and supple.  One thing Lexus does really well is seats.  The leather is delicious, and I swear their engineers must spend years getting the seat cushion designs &quot;just right&quot;.  I work very long hours, so am a big one for comfort.  At the end of the day I like to get into a car that feels great.  The SC is a master pamperer  -even before you turn the key.

The design and layout of controls is typical Lexus: understated, purposeful,  and 100% ergonomically correct.  About the only things that bug me are the hard-to-read-while-driving climate control and stereo system LCD displays, although these are somewhat improved on more recent models (they changed them for the 1997 model year).

In reality, understated elegance describes everything that Lexus makes.  This is true of the rest of the SC as well.  The lines (both inside and out) are clean, simple and well thought out.  Everything seems to flow nicely together, from the way the doors connect with the dash when closed to the flowing lines running from the front grill all the way up the hood.  Some people like a lot of gadgets, and the Lexus SC is certainly fully equipped, but one wouldn't ever know this unless they actually played with the controls.  This is not a complicated car, and there are none of the superfluous add-ons or gimmicks which are common in this price class (down-payment-for-a-small-mansion territory).  Everything you need is there, and the general feeling is one of being nicely spoiled by the amenities in this car.

Let's talk about the stereo.  Rather, I'll just shut up for a moment and silently worship the stereo.  [Silence] ...Ok, breathe... Many of the SC400s out there are equipped with the optional 280 watt Nakamichi sound system.  This awesome setup is an audiophiles dream, providing truly outstanding clarity and power under all circumstances.  Thanks to the generous amount of sound insulation used in the SC, one does not need to crank it up to enjoy it.  All automakers should experience the Nakamichi sound systems Lexus puts in their cars -they could all learn a thing or three (yes, even Infiniti which puts fantastic Bose audio systems in their cars would appreciate the outstanding power and clarity of the Lexus Nakamichi systems).

If smooth shifting were an Olympic event, the automatic transmission in the SC400 would walk away with the gold medal.  This is a fantastic transmission, and its software is capable of adapting to different driving styles (aggressive or languid).  The available manual transmission in the SC300 is smooth and precise, with no notchiness or quirky characteristics. It is a pity that Lexus does not see fit to offer a manual in the V8 SC400, as doing so would endlessly please automotive enthusiasts of the highest order (i.e. Jaguar and BMW fans).

Abundant power, smoothly and effortlessly applied to the road is something worth paying for in any automobile.  It is for this reason that the SC400 would ultimately be my choice, even though (sadly) a manual transmission is not available.  The 4.0L Lexus V8 is one of the smoothest on the planet, producing 290 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 300 pound-feet of easily-accessible torque at 4,000 rpm.  It is amazing how powerful this car is. Even when cruising at 65 on the freeway, plenty of passing power is just a quick stab at the accelerator away.  What truly amazes me is just how quiet this powerplant is. Granted, the exhaust on the SC is tuned for a more aggressive sound than in the LS400 (in which the same engine appears), but even so, this is an eerily quiet car.  Typical of all Lexus vehicles, you have to check the gauges to make sure the engine is actually running while idling in a parking lot.

The 3.0L inline six in the SC300 is very smooth, but lacks the hearty grunt of the V8.  However, as is generally true of the world's finer inline-sixes, this engine revs freely and feels very linear.  This is the same engine found in both the Lexus GS300 and the Toyota Supra.  Not much of a surprise, this is considered to be one of the most reliable engines in the world.  The rumors are true: Lexus (read: Toyota) makes very, <i>very</i> good engines.  This one is probably their finest work to date, having been employed in many platforms with phenomenal success.  Now if only Lexus would find it in their hearts to shoehorn the Supra's turbocharged version of this powerplant into the SC and make it available to us mere mortals here in the US (make mine a stickshift, please).

*Note: Both engines are costly to run, as they both require premium (92+ octane) fuel (and lots of it -especially the V8).  However, as the old (?) saying goes, if you can't afford the gas, you can't afford the car.  ;-)

Stylistically, the SC is simply beautiful.  I love the gentle, yet somehow still pleasantly aggressive flowing lines that run from front to back.  Lexus engineers did not design this car in a conventional fashion, opting instead to sculpt plaster-filled balloons into their interpretation of what a luxury GT should look like.  However unorthodox their methodology might be, the design works -and it works well.  The end result is a gently flowing profile with soft rounded corners and a nice, long hood.  This is a traditional design, executed in a contemporary fashion with plenty of class and a powerful stance.

In reality, the concept is very similar to that of the now defunct BMW 8-series (a moment of silence, please), yet the overall effect is completely different.  The 8 was a sharp-edged, serious performance car, while the SC has a much more of an English GT feel to it, thanks to its gently flowing lines and super-smooth character.  However, make no mistake --this car does not feel English.  It is most definitely Japanese in origin, as is evidenced by it's slightly reserved manner both on the road and in terms of appearance.

...Now for the fun part.  ...Insert key.  �Turn.  �And smile as you leave reality far behind.

The SC is a lovely road car.  I drove one (an SC400) to Las Vegas from Southern California about two years ago, and let me tell you -the highway is the perfect place to truly experience all the SC400 has to offer.  Passing a big semi on the I-15 is the visceral equivalent of taking off in a fighter-jet.  The delivery of all that V8 power is silky smooth, yet there is enough of it to thoroughly embarrass lesser competitors (such as the supercharged Buick Riviera).  Cruising at speed is a near-silent, thoroughly enjoyable experience.  This car floats over expansion joints as if they weren't even there (ok, perhaps that's a bit of an overstatement --bit it is quite smooth).

Around town, either engine is more than enough to merge with traffic and thoroughly delight the enthusiast.  To be honest, the inline six would be plenty for me, but I doubt I could resist checking the option box for the massive power of an optional V8 in any car. :-)  Example: my brother in-law bought a 1998 Firebird with the V6.  I kicked his ass all over the place for not getting the V8, and I still tease him about it to this day.  A much-used vegetable beverage slogan-turned-clich� is wholly appropriate here: &quot;I could have had a V8!&quot;  Of course, there is the small matter of slightly increased premium dino juice consumption (definitely not a vegetable beverage).

One of the most attractive aspects of this car, and one of the most compelling reasons to buy a Lexus is their legendary build quality and reliability.  Each and every owner I have ever spoken with about the SC coupe (and there have been many) has not had a single bad word to say about their car.  The only complaint I have ever heard is that while these cars are extremely reliable, when they do need work, parts and labor are expensive.  This of course, is true of any premium automobile.  Come to think of it, I do recall the owner of a 1995 SC300 complaining that she had replaced the rubber door seals twice on the driver's side of her car.  According to Lexus, hers is an isolated case.

In closing, let me simply say this:  the Lexus SC coupe is the very embodiment of everything I look for in a car I would drive myself on a daily basis.  There are the usual packaging issues common to the US (no manual transmission offered with the most powerful engine), but all in all, the SC is a wonderful automobile.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone with a desire to drive something with both character and power.  It even has a decent (but not exactly large) trunk and smallish back seats for the kids.  :-)

Oh, and the &quot;valet factor&quot; is considerable.  This is one very sharp looking car with enough cachet to satisfy any 5th Avenue or Rodeo Drive shopper.

Here's the stats:

Length: 192.5 inches
Width:  70.9 inches
Height: 53.2 inches
Wheelbase: 105.9 inches
Ground clearance: 5.1 inches
Curb Weight (SC300): 3,560 lbs.
Curb Weight (SC400): 3,655 lbs.
Fuel tank capacity: 20.6 gallons
Trunk capacity: 9.3 cubic feet

Fuel consumption (SC300): 19/24 mpg (city/highway)
Fuel consumption (SC400): 18/25 mpg (city/highway)

0-60 mph (SC300): 7.4 seconds
0-60 mph (SC400): 6.3 seconds
Standing � mile (SC300): 15.8 seconds
Standing � mile (SC400): 14.7 seconds

Used examples of these cars can be had relatively cheaply, and should prove to be reliable for years to come (provided you find a well-maintained example).  Here in Southern California, one can easily pick up a 1992 SC400 in good to excellent condition for about $18,000 to $20,000 (less for a high-milage example).  The SC300 should be about $1.500 to $2,500 less for a comparable car of the same vintage.

I hope you found this Epinion to both informative and fun to read.  If either applies, please rate this piece highly! Thanx! ~Matt :-<br><br>
