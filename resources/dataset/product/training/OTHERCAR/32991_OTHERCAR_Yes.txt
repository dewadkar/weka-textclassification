            I did through research before purchasing this vehicle.  The price was really good.  Compared to the Navigator, the price was darn good.  Although this is a new vehicle, I have had some trouble with a really annoying squeak and rattle that comes from the front-end.  I have taken the Yukon to two different Service departments.  No one has been able to fix it.  So, please beware that when you hit the road in this fine vehicle, that the envious bystanders may know that it is you before you actually pass by. The Expedition or "Station Wagonish" Navigator has nothing on the sleek, take you anywhere body style of the Yukon SLT.  The smooth lines and curves brings on a lot of looks from envious bystanders.  The smell of leather is enough to put your mind on nothing but the open road.  Sometimes I find myself just wanting to sit in it without going anywhere just so I can inhale that heavenly smell of leather.  The interior lighting is impeccable.  And don't forget those standard heated rear view mirrors that defrosts with the push of a button.  Oh man, the built-in armrests are a plus.  Just sit back, relax, and drive in comfort.  And it does �park like a dream�.  I work in an area where parking is a killer.  Everywhere you look, there is parallel parking.  I had an Olds Alero before.  I could not parallel park that thing worth a dime.  But this twice as big Yukon really handles well.  I just pull up and back right into the parking spot.  No trouble.  I LOVE this vehicle.
