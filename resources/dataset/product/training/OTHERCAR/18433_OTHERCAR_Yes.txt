            I have driven this car for about three years as a leased vehicle. Here is some of the major problems with this car. The car needs a more powerful engine. Merging on the highway requires good timing and/or a lack of fear. Also with this kind of acceleration I would expect better gas mileage than 27 mpg. I had a 1996 Camry that I average 33 mpg driving the same roads and conditions. I have a two year old child that can not fit well into the child car seat because the car lack sufficient rear seating space. I would not recommend this car for people with child car seats. The air conditioner on this car is not very cold. It takes 20-30 minutes to feel comfortable in 80 degree weather.
Now for the good point about this car. I have the Classic Edition by the way. The car is good in the snow. An oil change can be done by most people without jacking the car or using  car ramps or lifts. The drain plug is easy to access from the front under the car. The oil filter can be removed easily. Just open the front hood and using a oil wench remove and replace with a new oil filter. Toyotas in general are very dependable and this car is no exception. I have only done routine maintenance on the car with not one problem since I have leased it back in 1997. I like the low cost of maintenance and worry-free driving. 
I do like the Camry better. If you can swing the payments I prefer a Camry over the Corolla. The Camry is more powerful, easier on gas,roomier, and has better air conditioner cooling. But not all of us can afford a Camry and the Corolla is a good dependable choice for a small car overall.<br><br>
