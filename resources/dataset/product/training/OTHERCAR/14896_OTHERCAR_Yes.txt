            The Sony Mavica Camera has been my first and only experience with digital cameras. One reason is that the camera uses standard 3.5 floppies, not a flash card like most cameras. The recording options and picture quality are more than adequate for most family photos, and if you need photos for the web, what easier way can there be.

Although still a little pricey, it's a great product and I highly recommend it as a choice. Our local police department chose this camera as it's first digital.<br><br>
