            Who Wants a Cadillac that Zings?

Just a few months before I left Canada, I rented a Cadillac Catera for five days. I just had sold my Ford Explorer and had to deliver it from Toronto to the new owner in Montreal. After turning over the Explorer to the new owner, I needed a car to get around for a few days and return to Toronto.

A lady friend of mine that lives in Toronto owns a 1999 Catera. She always talked very favorably about it. But one time after I gave her a ride in 84 Eldorado she never stopped talking of how much more comfortable the ride was in
my Eldorado than her Catera. 

Her remarks had always stuck in my mind. Now I love my old Eldorado, but I knew it was not the most comfortable car Cadillac ever manufactured. So to say the least I was a bit curious.

At first glance the Catera looked very good. It reminded me of the late 1970 when Cadillac first made an intermediary car with all the comfort and luxury of a full size sedan, the Seville. But this is where my positive impression of this car ended.

I had read in the manufacturer�s page that the Cadillac Catera was rated as a near-luxury automobile. Well to me a near luxury does not and should never equal Cadillac.

Since 1975, I have owned 3 Eldorados, 2 Deville and one Seville. During that period and up until today I have noticed that the Cadillac Division of General Motor has always been trying to come out with a new gadget car or something. First there was the, then the Allante and now the Catera, the Cadillac that zings.

I think that Cadillac should stop to try to be the cool kid on the block and build the kind of car they were once known to be the master in, the luxury sedan. By investing so much effort and research dollars in new fandangle gadget car, they have taken away from the luxury one expects in their automobiles.

At this time I want to point out that the Catera I rented was not a bad car at all. But it was not my vision of what a Cadillac is and should be. If I want a car that zing I will drive a Porsche and when I want comfort, I should find it in a Caddy.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Now that I have blasted the Cadillac Division of General Motor, I want to point out that even if I do not think that the interior of the Catera is worthy of an interior of a luxury car, it is still a very impressive one.

The one aspect of the Catera�s 2001 interior I liked is the roominess it offers even for large body people. Getting in the passenger side front seat is a breeze and if you remember to raise the steering column before getting out of the driver�s seat than you should not have a hard time getting in again. 

The rear seat area also offer lots of room, except maybe for very long legged teen-agers you might need to transport around.

I did like a lot the sound system, the car I rented was equipped with a Bose stereo radio/cassette system and the sound quality from the speakers was excellent.

All the controls are within reach and the driver has a very good view of the gauges.

The car I drove had problem with the speed control. On the highway when it had to climb a hill at times it would kick-off. I remember that I had a similar problem with a 1979 Eldorado. I doubt it is the technology but it is quite a
coincidence.

As a whole the interior is well made and is very comfortable.

The exterior:

I know that the Catera is manufactured in Germany with European styling in mind. How come then when I look at it from the exterior it reminds me of a Toyota Camry or some other Japanese Luxury sedan? It still is a very nice car in
appearance but to me it does not fit the bold look Cadillac is known for their
automobiles.

THE ROAD TEST

I have heard that Catera owners complain a lot about the lack of power. To me the 200 horsepower engine did satisfied me. It is true that I am not a known speed demon and at the time you are reading this review I probably have not overtaken anyone on the road yet.

I would have preferred a smoother suspension, not that it is bad and I know I keep coming back to this point. When I rented this Catera, I was renting a Cadillac and it did not give the smooth ride I expect in a Caddy.

The car handled very well on the highway and I found it great for city driving because of the panoramic view you have from the interior looking out.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Cadillac Catera I drove was as follows

Engine: A V-6, 3 liter 24 valve motor, which develop 200 horsepower.
Transmission: A 4-speed automatic transmission.
Brakes: 4-wheel disc brakes with the anti-lock breaking system (ABS.)
Tires: Are mounted on 17-inch aluminum wheels. P235/45R17

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

I believe that my intro covers my feeling for the Catera. I checked the selling price in the United States and to me it seems a bit high especially if you want to include the luxury package.

Now I would not have criticized the Catera so much if I had rented a Buick Catera, or a Toyota Catera. I am certain you get my point. The rental price from the agency was equal to the price of renting a Camry and it is about what this
car is comparable to.
