            It was a difficult choice for my dad to get rid of his 1984 Mercedes 190 Diesel, but at the same time, he realized that it was a man made vehicle and can only last for certain time, also owning a vehicle that belongs to this century makes a lot of sense.

When I helped him to look for a replacement, the new Mercedes was out of the picture, the price for a decent base model is at least 30000 and up, so we narrowed down to the new Camry and the Altima. 

The price of the Altima was lower than the Camry, that was an important factor but also, even though the new Camry looks really nice, the style is something that really makes this car stand out of the competition.  Even the Maxima does not look like the top of the line anymore if you put it side by side with the V6.

The ride is almost as good as it looks, the 4 cylinder engine provides a very peppy 180 horsepower, a 4 cylinder engine for that size of vehicle looks small on paper, but when you drive it, you will feel excellent acceleration and good handling, is nothing like any regular 4 cylinder out there. 

The V6 gives you 240hp, if the 4cylinder is quick, this one is almost too fast to handle, it will give you that sensation of being thrown to the back of the seat, the suspension holds the car in the ground all the time and you can barely feel that the car is leaning to the sides.  If you are a driver enthusiast definitely the V6 is an excellent ride, however the 4 cylinder is also really fun to drive and handles really good.  The only drawback I noticed in the two versions was a lot of movement in the power steering when you accelerate, I wish they would make a rear whell drive on the V6, that will make it almost perfect but this is not a race car anyways.

The interior is huge, is like and extended VW Beetle style bubble that gives you plenty of headroom, the sensation of being far from the engine gives you a lot of security and everything is simple to read an modern looking.  The quality on the fabric has a lot to improve, it looks like is going to get old quick specially in light interiors, a good combination could be the quality of the finished of the older model with the design of the new one, but when you look at such a nice design and have an astonishin driving experience, that can be easy to forgive, just make sure to mention it so hopefully we would be able to see some upgrades in newer models.

The only thing I wonder is how they have the guts to put hubcaps in a vehicle that worth more than 19000 dollars, when you get to that price range you expect more than that, I guess they know what they have is unique, and the people like my dad, that can not afford another "package", will eat it because is a really nice car. 

Right now it's been 8 months and only had a recall about an airbag sensor, the ride is really smooth, and if you don't mind hearing complements in the shopping malls, and washing nose and hand marks out of the windows this is a car that  have a lot of potential to hold it's value and hopefully, after it's success, Nissan will keep it without major redesign for a few years.
