            I really never liked mini vans until I saw and drove an odyssey. I have a 1998 odyessy with the 4 doors and a hatch. My kids can get in and out very easily without slamming a sliding door on their fingers. They didn't like the sliding doors on other vans because they mashed their fingers in their grandpa's aerostar when they were younger. The odyssey handles like an accord because it is one. The only reason I bought it is because it is very much like an accord since it has the same frame,engine, and transmission. It is also much roomier than an accord. The odyssey is the perfect run around town kid mover. It does well on trips on less than 6 hours also. I get about 28mpg on the highway and around 23 in town. The 4 speed automatic shifts very smoothly and does not hunt between gears. It runs great, handles great, and is fun to drive. I usually trade cars quite often, but I don't think I will ever sell my odyssey. It is the best vehicle I have owned and I have owned one of about everything. Get you a 98 model and you will love it.<br><br>
