            I really like this car. The 2000 model has a great deal of room. The front seats have plenty of leg and head room. Someone over six feet tall can be comfortable driving this car. The back seat is much larger than expected. Two children can sit in it with out touching each other. There is a lot of leg room in the back as well. Three adults can fit in the back without being squished. The trunk is very roomy. You could fit several large suitcases without any trouble. All dials, gauges, and buttons are large and easy to reach. This car gets get gas milage and I feel safe driving it. The only problem is the wide body frame leaves a larger than average blind spot. Overall I would recommend this car.<br><br>
