            For years and years, the Honda Accord has been the second best selling car in America, and there are reasons why this makes sense.  The car, while not spectacular, is easy on the eyes; definitely more curvy than the boxy Camry, but not to excess like the 1999 Ford Taurus.  

Engine choice begin with a weakling four-banger, emitting 135 horsepower with 2.3 liters of displacement.  Roughly equal to the power of a base Camry, this engine is only enough to get by.  Up one level is another 4 cylinder, this one putting out 150 horses.  Definitely a better choice than the base 4, but waiting in the wings is a 200 horsepower V6, the logical choice for anyone who would like to get there today.  Always a fan of uplevel engines, I must highly recommend the V6.

For a low, somewhat long sedan, handling figures for the Accord are nothing short of dismal.  Roadholding was tested to .75g on the skidpad, only .02g better than a Ford Explorer.  Yes, you read that right: a Ford Explorer.

Safety in the Accord is very good for a car of its size, with side impact beams, good chassis stiffness, dual front airbags, and knee bolsters.  However, emergency stopping distances are mediocre, with the non-ABS brakes on the DX and 5-speed LX models locking up very quickly.  These models take 151-157 feet to stop from 60-0.  Go for the top level and that figure is cut to 138.  ABS is definitely a good buy.

Overall, the Honda Accord is not a spectacular car, but it is a car that will deliver for the money you put into it.  Good reliability and styling that puts Toyota to shame make the Accord a better buy than the Camry.  You get what you pay for in this car.<br><br>
