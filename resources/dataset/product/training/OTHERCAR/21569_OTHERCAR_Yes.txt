            We have a 1995 Dodge Intrepid, and love it. Bought it in 1997. Even with two kids in car seats, we find the car to be very roomy in the front and back seat along with a nice roomy trunk.  It rides smooth also and the gas mileage it good for such a large car - we take monthly trips upstate (2-3 hours each away) and this car makes the ride enjoyable.  We can fit a fifth person in the back center even with the car seats when we need too. It is the &quot;old style&quot; model ( a little boxier than the current style out). We bought it at 40000 miles and currently it has 75000 miles.  The only items we've had to have repaired are the air conditioner (which turned out to be under extended warranty) and the water pump - we've probably had to put $600 into over the past 2 1/2 years.
Overall, we'd buy this car again and have been very happy with it.  We picked out initially because of the interior roominess (my husband is 6'2&quot; and 255 lbs and he still has room between his head and the ceiling) and the Chrysler name, and have been very happy with the result.
