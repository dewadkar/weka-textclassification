            I went to a used car lot to see what kind of cars they might have in my price range.  They had mostly older or high mileage vehicles.  I own a 1992 Plymouth Acclaim with a little over 180,000 miles on it.  Except for the damage I recently caused to the car, it still runs very well.  It still starts right up and has never stalled on me.  However, it is getting tired and I wouldn't mind having a never set of wheels.  So, when I went to this car dealership, I noticed they had a little Dodge Shadow.  I've heard and read that later model Shadows are pretty good cars with the 2.5L 4-cylinder engine, which is the same 4-cylinder that my Acclaim has.  I got in it and it was in pretty bad shape.  It had 111,000 miles on it and looked VERY used.  So I'm got out and moved on down the line of cars they had.  At the very end was a 1994 Plymouth Sundance.  I thought to myself &quot;boy...looks just like the Shadow.  I hope it's in better shape.&quot;  Well, it was in better shape inside and out.  However when I got in to check out how much mileage it had, I was amazed to see that it had 349,860 miles on it!  I've never seen that kind of mileage on a car before, except on a Volvo and Nissan Maxima, which are more expensive cars.  I'm guessing the car belonged to a person that did a lot of traveling!  Almost 350,000 miles on the same car in six years!  Wow!  I didn't buy the car of course, but I'm definetely buying a Chrysler of some sorts with that good old 2.5L 4-cylinder engine.  It's an easy engine to work on, and I can easily do tune-ups myself for a cost of about $20, as compared to my Camry that costs a rediculous $110 dollars per tune.  I'm gonna stick with an Acclaim when I buy instead of a Sundance/Shadow because it's a larger, roomier, and safe car.  I do recomend any Chrysler product with the 2.5L 4-cylinder engine.  Oh yeah, one more thing...Why did Chrysler stop making this engine?!  They could have easily gotten another 40hp out of it.  Dummies...<br><br>
