            We ordered this truck new in August 1999. Promptly delivered with only 5 miles it has been a true joy to own ever since. Now with over 32,000 miles it's still my second love (next to my spouse of course).

The handling is great. With the sport plus package the truck is very responsive, accelerates well and looks good in red. 

Currently, it's Feb. 2001 as you can tell from the mileage I love to drive it. Even loaded with a new refrigerator or furniture for our move the truck responded well.    

I have noticed a difference in dealerships. The Dodge 5 Star dealerships are much more thorough and professional. When my steering wheel developed a slight squeak they replaced (under warranty) the entire steering column. 

The non-5 Star dealership did not have a piece of weatherstripping in I wanted for the door and didn't seem very interested in helping. They did however order the part and call my home no less than 5 times in 3 days to tell me the part came in. This proved to be a nuisance.

As a daily driver, the truck is comfortable and gets adequate gas mileage (20 mpg 50/50 city/county). I enjoy driving it and look forward to having the truck for years to come.
