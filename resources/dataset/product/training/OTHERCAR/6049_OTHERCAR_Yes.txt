            My first grandchild was 6 months old before I ever got a picture of him.  A new family starting out, my son complained about the cost of film developing and it was like pulling teeth when I finally got him to take the baby to a photographer on me.  So when I started thinking about Christmas presents, a digital camera was the first thing I thought of, so I started looking for digital cameras online.  Being a single parent, I don't have a lot of money to spend on gifts, but I also wanted something that took decent pictures.  I was very hesitant when I saw the price of this camera, but it also had good reviews, so I took a chance and ordered it.  When the camera arrived I tried it out right away.  I wanted to make sure it was good before I gave it to my son.  The instructions took a little bit to understand and it's easy to get double exposures because you don't have an audible sound when you click the picture, but once I got over that I was pleasantly surprised.  You also have to make sure the flash is on automatic.  Pictures I would normally use a flash on don't need the flash with this camera.  Granted, it's not as nice as the $600 digital camera I have, but it is a good beginners camera.  I was happy enough with it to buy another one for my daughter.<br><br>
