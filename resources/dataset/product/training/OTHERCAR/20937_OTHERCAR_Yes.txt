            Ordered the PTC in early April, 2000 for July delivery. Dealer notified me of a cancellation and I was able to move my delivery date to mid_may (lucky me). Got the Limited Edition in Taupe with all the bells and whistles, and 5-speed manual. Absolutely the best car I've purchased in over 20 years.
My wife, who owns an Infinity I30, drove the PTC down the freeway for 80 miles and was very impressed. She said it matched her I30 for comfort and handling.
In our area, some dealers are marking up to as much as $7,000.00 over MSRP. The dealer I used sold it at MSRP, $19,990.00.
So far, no problems with the PTC. Lots of problems everywhere I go with spectators stopping you and asking questions or admiring the car. They even question you at stop lights or ask you to pull over to see it up close.
My 22 year-old son liked it so much, he ordered one too.<br><br>
