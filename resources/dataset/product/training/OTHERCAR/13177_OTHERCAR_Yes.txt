            After reading the thoughtful reviews here on epinions.com, I decided to take advantage of the $4K rebate on 2001 models and purchased a Mazda Millenia. Purchase price after rebate was $23K. 

Folks, you're right ... this is one whale of a value! It you're looking for a comfortable, luxurious, elegant, and powerful vehicle, do yourself a favor and test drive a Millenia. I've owned or extensively driven Lexus, Acura, Infiniti and Diamente, and the Millenia is right up there with these top of the line vehicles.

There are many details, large and small, that make the Millenia a pleasure to drive. From the solid feel of all controls to the amazing turbo-charged kick that zooms you from 0 to 60 in a few breathless seconds. 

Overall I am very happy with this machine.
