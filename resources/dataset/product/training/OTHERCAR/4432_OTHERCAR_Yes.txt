            I had not owned a truck since a compact Mazda longbed pickup in 1980. I went shopping for a Toyota, Ranger, and perhaps a B-series Mazda. The Toyotas were a lot more expensive, feature for feature, and the Mazda's close sibling, the Ranger, had a shorter warranty. Also, it was nearly impossible to find a well-equipped 2 wheel drive in *any* of these. (The dealers are all pushing 4WD whether anyone needs/wants it or not.)
      I had 'bout given up when we found a new B4000 with the 5-speed automatic and limited slip axle. We liked the utility of the 4-door version, but noticed a bit more wind noise around the extra two doors. We also test drove a 2.5 liter, but felt it lacked enough power in the heavier extended cab model. So far, we have 16K miles on it, and no problems. Real world mpg is 18 around town and 22 on the freeway, on regular gas.
     The power window/locks package with remote keyless really has us spoiled! The AC will chill you out, if you want! The CD player could use a little help on the bass noises for rock 'n roll, but is still better than our last two car systems. I am 6'2&quot;, and this truck is comfortable on 200 mile trips -- no back problems at all. I have hauled up to 400+ pounds in the bed while doing yard cleanup. We have the factory class 3 receiver hitch, and this model is rated to tow up to 6000#. Someday we plan to try pulling a small trailer or fifth wheel, but that's still out in the future. 
     It's purely subjective, but the doors still have a solid &quot;thunk&quot; when they close; the vehicle is very solid. The slow-turning 4. liter engine is definitely the &quot;truck engine&quot; of the three engines offered, achieving all its torque at low rpm's. 
     There's little to dislike about it -- higher gas mileage would always be nice, but it does very well for a 3500# truck. I wish the antenna would retract so I wouldn't have to remove it for car washes. I take it to the dealer for oil changes every 4000 miles. 
     As to &quot;who should buy it&quot; -- since the rear jump seats will seat 2 kids or the occasional adult, a lot of people of all ages and lifestyles could be happy with it. For occasional hauling, I figure that about a cubic yard of stuff such as yard trimmings will fit in the bed. One note: since Ford (reportedly) uses one basic chassis for all the Rangers/Explorer/Mazda B-series, you can get only the &quot;short bed&quot; as a Mazda, whether regular or extended cab. If you want a long bed model, seek out a standard cab long bed Ranger instead. 
     About the auto trans: on the highway it locks into a fifth gear overdrive, turning about 2500 rpm at about 70 mph. Very quiet, and a lot more comfort than we expected. For whatever reason, there was a lot less pressure in dealing with the Mazda dealer than the 3 different Ford dealers we shopped. Balanced against that the Ford stores did have a much larger inventory. 
   So far, so good. One year down, at least nine to go........
