            The Tundra is the best driving, riding, and performing truck I have ever owned.

After my previous domestic truck died, I started looking at the market. The Toyota sold me on the first "date." Look underneath. Everything is undercoated or painted. This reduces road noise and helps prevent rust and corrosion. The external and internal door handles on the extended cab doors are nice for passengers. The interior is ergonomic even for a 6' 4" person like me. The CD/Tape player is a nice touch that not many of its competitors offer. Air-conditioning controls are easy to understand and operate. Cup holders that hold 64 oz. drinks are a nice touch, so are the cup holders and the arm rest in the back seat.No detail was left unaddressed. The passengerï¿½s seatbelt light only comes on when a passenger is in the seat. The seatbelts are also height adjustable. 

Sometimes, I almost think that the engine is overpowered. The transmission is very smooth and senses every move of the driver's foot. The cruise control causes the transmission to down shift too quickly when going up a hill. However, I could see this useful when towing. The Michelin tires are extremely quiet at 75 mph. They NEVER hum and control the truck perfectly on the road. Road noise is very low for a truck. Steering is firm but not stiff.

We bought a 4x2. I like the fact that the height and wheels are the same for 4x4's as well. The only way to tell the drivetrain on these trucks from the outside is a small logo on the tailgate.

Checking/changing fluids is very easy. However, changing the oil requires dropping down part of the front brush guard. That requires loosening a few extra bolts. Any other work is relatively simple because of the clever layout and design of the engine compartment. This can't be a foreign truck. It's too easy to work on. Although, major servicing is not in this Toyota's vocabulary.

Revision 1: The truck was recalled for a turn signal socket not holding bulbs in place in some production trucks. A Chevy we owned had a similar problem in the brake light. It never wanted to turn the light off. Chevy never did recall the truck even though they had many different part numbers for the same part, meaning they had to redesign the same part multiple times before the problem was fixed.

Revision 2: The transmission seems to "thump" into gear when the accelerator is pressed when the transmission is cold. The a/c blower also has a bearing going out. Both are to inconsistent to take to the dealer. Neither are bothersome enough to change my mind about this truck!

Revision 3: Do not have an accident in this truck. Remember to put the tailgate up. My dad was driving the truck when he backed it into a tree. The tailgate was down. $1,200 for a new tailgate and paint. Be careful. You can't find salvage parts on this new of a truck.

Revision 4: The bearing on the a/c blower has not been a problem recently. The transmission "thump" turned out to be a rear brake issue. Once the dealership bothered to look at the computer database for factory "fixes," they found a service bulletin. Once the brakes were repaired, there are no more problems with the "thump". It is still a well engineered truck. The tires are very good and are still quieter than comparable trucks.
