            I was once one of those ANTI MINI VAN people.  Until the first time I saw and drove my Oldsmobile Silhouette.  There are so many things that I love about my Silhouette.  I would have to say that the power sliding door would have to be my favorite thing.  It is a blessing when I have my five month old in one arm and my three year old hanging on to the other arm.  All I have to do is push a button.  Another thing I love about my Silhouette is the inflator system.  I feel a little safer knowing if I ever find myself in a situation that may call for releasing air from my tires i.e; sand or snow, I can inflate them without having to find a service station that doesn't charge for air.  I have also used it for other things, such as: Blowing up the kiddie pool,inflating things such as basketballs, beach balls, pool floats, and mattresses.  The Traction Control system is another feature that makes me feel a little safer in my Silhouette.  I believe that this is the greatest vehicle that I have ever owned.  When the time comes for me to look for another vehicle, I can assure you that I will only have to go to the nearest Oldsmobile dealer.<br><br>
