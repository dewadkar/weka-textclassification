            I recently purchased a sunfire.  I did plenty of homework on the internet and at the car dealers before settling on a  specific car.  I had previously had a compact, sporty, yet comfortable and affordable car.  It was wrecked by a woman who ran a red light.  Anyhow,  I was really upset to have to buy another car.  I looked high and low only to find that most cars were just way too expensive.  The less expensive cars seemed too generic of poor quality.

When I saw the sunfire for the first time, I thought it was cute and sporty.  I sat in the car and I took it for a test drive.  The car seats were comfy and the car drove smoothly.  I went home and investigated it further.  I checked online and offline for any complaints or recalls on the pontiac sunfire.  I wasn't successful in finding any complaints or anything like that..  thank goodness!!!  

I then called the dealership and spoke with the fleet manager.  (fleet managers don't work off commission)  I finally settled with my sunfire and got 4k knocked off the price.  I was able to buy a 19k car for 15k!!!  It's amazing what  you can get when you wheel and deal and speak to the fleet manager.  

Anyhow, my car is fully loaded..  The car has great features.. it feels like a luxury sports car at an affordable price!  The seats are comfy.. there's lots of space in the trunk.. the stereo system is great!  It even sets the volume of my radio according to the speed I'm driving.. and it even came with a  security system..  There is lots.. and I mean lots of space in the glove compartment.. you can fit a six pack of soda in there.. and... there are plenty of cup holders....  We ate in the car the other day and were VERY comfortable.

Overall...  test this car out if you're looking for a sporty yet comfy and affordable car.  It's better than buying a cheaply made car that has no features!  I LOVE my car!  Not only that.. but the sunfire even came with a sporty spoiler on the back..  There are lots of other features to this car.. but it's best if you check it out yourself....  I totally recommend this car..  It doesn't get any better!

Oh.. by the way.. my car is a sunfire GT... not a convertible.
