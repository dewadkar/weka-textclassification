            My girlfriend and I recently purchased the 2001 PT, basically because of it's unique appearance. As well we were on the hunt for an SUV, and this one was buy far the best priced vehicle in it's class. Fully loaded (Limited Edition), and with an extended warranty, it came in at just about $23,000! It's got excellent pick up, more than adequate room, and very comfortable (I'm 6'2&quot; and I can sit beautifully in the back or front). Not to mention all the luxuries, i.e.; leather seats, auto locks, windows, sunroof, alarm, and 16&quot; chrome wheels really set it off. Being that we are a young couple, this was a great not only a great value, but as well a great investment in our EPINIONS!<br><br>
