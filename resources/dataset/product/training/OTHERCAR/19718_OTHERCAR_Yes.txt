            Well christmas time came and passed and the one present I wanted wasn't there.  What was that present?  A digital camera of course.  Now unlike most normal people who want to be "en vogue" and just buy digital camera's because they're the cool thing to have right now and they really have no use for it, I on the other hand do.  I make webpages sort of as a hobby and the camera I got is perfect for this task.  So without anymore delay, my review.

I've wanted a digital camera for a long time so when I finally had money to get one I wanted to make sure I didn't get a crappy one so to speak.  So where did I come?  Here of course.  I read review on cameras in my price range and tried to find one to suit my needs the best I could.  What I found was the Sony Cybershot P20.  All the reviews were good and the price was cheap (being a college student who never has money that's a good thing).  So I looked into the camera a little more and decided that was the one.  Now you're probably thinking but this is a review on the P30 and I'll get to that so hang in there.  So I went to the trusty Best Buy store and asked for one.......they were out.  So I looked at the P30 sitting next to it for only another $100 and told myself I'm determined it will be mine......they were out.  So I went to a new electronics store a couple of blocks away and they only had the P30, but they actually had it in stock.  So $300 and quite a few hours later I walked out with a smile on my face and a digital camera in my hands.  Now the good part really starts.

I got it home and took it out of the box.  The only assembling you really need to do is put on the lense cap, the camera strap, insert the memory stick, and finally the battery and you're ready to go.  So off around the house I went.  First thing I came upon was how to work the flash.  I opened up the manual found the section on the flash and a minute or so later I was blinding my mom.  The next thing I was after was the self timer.  Once again I grabbed the manual and looked and a minute later I was set.  So if you're  a beginner to cameras and/or to digital cameras this one shouldn't really be a problem, and the manual is very easy to understand and tremendously helpful.  All of the options on the camera are pretty easily accessible through menus, knobs, and buttons.  So it definitely gets five stars on easy of use.

One of the important things I noticed about this camera that may not strike many people right off the bat as important is it's size and design.  As I was waiting in all those electronics stores to find that camera I heard many many people talk about how they didn't like their current digital camera because it was too small and didn't fit their hands.  That's one of the best things about this digital camera in my honest opinion.  It's about the same size and shape as a kodak disposable camera so if you're familiar with those you should be good.  The power button is a little small but still big enough to be usable.  The camera also has a pretty cool design just look wise, which really doesn't help it's performance, but then again does it hurt?  So as far as size, comfort, and "coolness" once again I'm going with 5 stars.

So I know what you're thinking, yeah yeah I just want to know if it takes good pictures.  Well then I'll give you what you want.   I figured the best way to do this was by example so I took a few pictures and put them on some websites so if you actually want to see the finished result just go to the sites by copy and pasting them in the address bar of one of your browser windows:

The camera has a resolution of 1.3 megapixels which if you go to the store the salesman (trying to get you out of another couple $100 will tell you isn't good enough) is great for those of us who just like making web pages and taking pictures for fun.  If you're doing anything professional just give up and shell out the money, but for the price I was quite surprised at the quality of the pictures this camera takes.  The only problem I've run into is if you have a lot of one color is seems to get a little "blotchy".  

So in closing:
This camera takes great pictures, has a nice price of $300, and is pretty easy to operate and handle.  The only things you may want to watch out for are the small memory stick and the batteries.  The camera comes standard with a 4 mb memory stick which if you make the pictures a little smaller you can get about 26 on, so I'd recommend stepping up to a 32 mb or a 64 mb stick.  The other thing is the camera eats batteries pretty quickly so the first thing I bought were 4 rechargeable batteries from the pharmacy and a little charger which was about $25, but has probably already saved me twice that.  So if you're looking for a digital camera and like me your wallet DOES have a bottom to it then I would recommend at least looking, if not seriously considering, this camera.  Thank you for reading.
