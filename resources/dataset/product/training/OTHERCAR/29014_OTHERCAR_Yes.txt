            I wanted one of these from the moment they came out, but I couldn't afford one.  Once I could afford one, I was about to "sign on the dotted line" when it occurred to me to make sure my 88-key synthesizer would fit in the back.  The door closed, but not the window...damn!  However, as soon as I got a smaller keyboard, I got a brand new 2000 Honda CRV.

EXTERIOR: The first thing I liked about the CRV was that it was a Honda.  (I'm partial to Hondas.)  The obvious second was the look.  I like the look.  Even now when my husband and I are driving around we point out ever CRV we see.  Besides that, I like that the tire is on the back of the vehicle, but doesn't really block my view.  I must admit there's is nothing spectacular about the look, but there's nothing bad about it, and it simply appeals to me.

INTERIOR: This is not a luxury vehicle, but it doesn't claim to be.  In fact, it's kind of a like a Honda Civic on steroids.  The interior materials are more than adequate and quite resilient.  There is plenty of front leg room and adequate leg room in the back seat.  The back seats recline, which is a nice feature.  

CARRY CAPACITY: For carrying things, the back seat pans fold up behind the front seats and the rear seat backs fold flat.  You can even choose to fold only one back seat down instead of both.  You musicians out there will understand when I tell you I can put back there a large keyboard amp, two keyboards in cases, two guitars in cases, three medium gig bags, two mic stands and one two-tier keyboard stand, a two-space effects rack, a 22 channel mixing board, and a fancy drum chair with a back, not entirely folded up.  AND I can still see out the back and side windows with all that stuff.  Personally, I think that's pretty impressive.  Granted, an SKB 88-key keyboard case won't fit lengthwise, but you can still carry a lot.

ENGINE: It's a 4-cylinder v-tech engine.  I've read a lot of reviews that it "needs more power", and I disagree.  If you want more power, buy something that says it's a 6-cylinder.  The CRV does just fine.  It accelerates uphill, gets on the highway and everything, even with 4 people in the car.  If you want 0 to 100 in two seconds, get a Porsche.

RIDE: Ever ridden in a Honda Civic?  The only difference is you're slightly higher up off the ground.  Other than that it's a car.  If you haven't ridden in a Honda Civic, all I can tell you is don't be afraid it will feel like a truck.  It really doesn't.  The only thing some people might see as a downside is that you can definitely hear the engine when you're going uphill and the radio is off.  It isn't unbearable though, and you almost never notice it.

HANDLING: This vehicle isn't REALLY an off-road vehicle.  If you have the 4-wheel drive variety, you can use it as such, but it's more a city-person's SUV.  It handles just fine on paved or dirt roads.  You do have to take sharp turns a little slower than in a low-to-the-ground car, but you never feel like you're going to flip over.

RELIABILITY: I've had my CRV since January 2nd of 2001, and NOTHING has gone wrong.  I get the regular servicing, and I'm even *gasp* occasionally a little late on the oil changes.  No problems.  Not one.

VALUE: Worth every penny.  Not a doubt in my mind.

THE VERDICT: It's not luxurious.  It's not the most powerful vehicle.  But it does exactly what you'd expect it to do given its specs.  As long as you know what you're buying, you'll be thrilled with what you get.
