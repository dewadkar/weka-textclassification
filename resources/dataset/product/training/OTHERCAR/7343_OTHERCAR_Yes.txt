            We were going on a trip to Italy and we were concerned about taking our old 35mm camera.  The new x-ray machines raise havoc with 35mm film and avoiding problems seemed like a hassle.  Besides, we had had the old 35mm for 15 years and it seemed like time we got up to date.

We did some research and decided on this camera.We are very happy with it.  Its small size made it easy to carry around and it took great pictures.  

However, to take advantage of all the features we never had the owners manual far away.  Also, the included battery charger got a lot of use because the batteries did not hold a charge for more than two days of picture taking.  And we took a lot of pictures.

But the pictures it took far surpassed anything our old 35mm camera could do.  We went to a introductory class on digital cameras and the instructor claimed we would never go back to our old 35mm.  That is certainly true. As for the camera being complicated, he also suggested to just set it on automatic and blast away.  90% of the time this is very satisfactory advice.

We can take short movies, take pictures in lighting conditions that would have defeated our old 35mm, and being able to immediately see the results is terrific.

Because this is our first digital camera, we are unable to compare with others.  But if you are thinking of switching to digital, this is a good choice.

The price has certainly dropped since we bought ours, so now it is truly a bargain.
