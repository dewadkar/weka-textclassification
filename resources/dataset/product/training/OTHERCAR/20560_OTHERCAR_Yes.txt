            The best car I ever had was a 1989 Acura Integra RS (automatic transmission).  It was quick, responsive, nimble, reliable, utilitarian....an all 'round great car to own.  In September 1999 I was forced to replace it, so I bought an 1999 Acura Integra LS (apparently Acura is making the RS only in very limited quantities).  I have two problems with the new model:

1) The new Integras are not as fast or responsive as the old ones! I am not at all technical so bear with me:  Acura has changed the structure of the gearing/drive-train on the new models and, while they have more horsepower than the older models, the power is not used as efficiently.  Acceleration in the 1999 Integra is sluggish and unpredictable in the low-range. I miss the confidence I used to have in the 1989 Integra whenever I needed to pull out onto a busy highway quickly.

2) Interior space is cramped.  I had a lot more room in the 1989 model.  Obviously the airbags take up some space, but the headroom is much lower too.  Someone told me it was because of the sunroof ( but can you get an Integra without one!?)

That said, the Integra is still one of the best deals going.  Acura reliability and service is simply outstanding.  You might pay more initially for an Acura, but you're getting a car that's built to last. Five years down the road, you'll be glad you bought it. <br><br>
