            I love this car...it's been through the wringer and it just keeps going on strong....i purchased the car in 1996 (previously owned by 1 owner) with  about 95,000 miles on it....i saw it on the used car lot and took it out for a short spin and was instantly impressed with the way it handled both on the highway and on city streets...it's a fun car to drive as well as easy...gives you a nice smooth ride...it's a 1991 grand prix se, power windows, power door locks, cruise, tilt, intermittent wipers, and a kick ass stereo....it took a little while to get used to the wiper blades opening differently than most normal cars, but that's what makes this car unique....

i haven't had too many problems with the car--after all..it does have high mileage...i have replaced the starter and the alternator..new brakes front and rear.. and new struts in the back...the oil is changed regularly.....i had one accident in the car and the only real signs of damage were the fact that the head lamps wouldn't work and it was leaking<br><br>
