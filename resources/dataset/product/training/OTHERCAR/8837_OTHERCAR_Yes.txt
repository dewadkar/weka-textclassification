            The design, feel, handling, motor, and features make the Honda Accord the best buy for its price. At around $21,000 for a fully decked out Accord, you cannot find much better. The outside looks like a luxury car, while the inside feels like one also (when you include leather especially). It accelerates very fast also. I think I got to 60 one time in 7 seconds and I have topped off at 135 before (don't try this though, it is very dangerous in any car, I'm an idiot). The car runs very smoothly though at any speed. It reminds me of the Lexus LS 400, the way it accelerates. It's sound system is great also. You can bump your system like crazy, and everyone within a mile can hear it.

Hear are the possible engines you can get with it:
2.3L 135 hp I4 
2.3L 150 hp I4 
3.0L 200 hp V6 

I have a 2.3L 150 hp I4 and it is more than enough power.

Although the engine is great, the roominess is what my family was after.  It is the only mid-sized car that my dad could fit in (he's 6'7&quot;).  All the other mid-sized sedans, including the Toyota Camry, were too small for him.  

This is the car for everyone.
