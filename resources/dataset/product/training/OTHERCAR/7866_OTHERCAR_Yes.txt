            I didn't purchase this car... my friend did (Black 330Ci) and he was gracious enough to let me drive this beautiful masterpiece of machinery. 
The first thing I noticed about the car was the low growl it greeted  me with when I started it... like it was trying to tell me, "drive me... c'mon, I know you want to..."
Then OMG... VRRRROOOOOOOOOOOM... This has to be the most incredible car I have ever driven (until I get that wonderful chance to drive the E46 M3).  I was always a bit cautious in becoming a sports coupe enthusiast since sports cars aren't meant to be comfortable.  But this car changed my mind and my whole perception of driving.
The 330Ci, which is what i drove, is a bit different from the 330i sedan counterpart, which is a great thing on BMW's part. Rather than just sticking two doors on the sedan model, BMW designed this car to be a true sports coupe.  It is lower, wider, and longer than the sedan.  I've driven the 328i and the improvements in handling between the two body styles is incredible.  They are both GREAT cars.  Just the 330i sedan is more of a LUXURY car, while the 330Ci is a SPORTS coupe.
The cars come with amenities galore, from the basic "luxury" elements such as ambient lighting and xenon headlights (now low-beam and high-beam standard) to more eclectic ones like auto up/down all windows, a passenger side mirror that automatically tilts down in reverse to make parallel parking easier, to the ability to close ALL windows and moonroof with just turning the key in the door.
Also since the E46 styling update, this car has never looked better.  
BMW is KNOWN for the incredible DRIVING EXPERIENCE it gives with each car... hence their slogan "THE ULTIMATE DRIVING EXPERIENCE".  That being said, this car has it's focuses on just that.  LUXURY wise, although this car gives pretty much every extra and other car does, the interior styling is kept very conservatively... if you want TRUE luxury, go for Mercedes or Lexus... they do a better job of accomplishing that living room feel.  But for driving enthusiasts, the 330Ci/i is the best car you can get in this price range. You WON'T be disappointed.
