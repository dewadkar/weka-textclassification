            When my husband totaled our mid-sized truck, I decided it was time to step up to a mini-van.  We have two kids and their various friends that we drive around frequently and the four seatbelts in our Geo Metro just wasn't cutting it.  We knew that we didn't want the new one (I've never made a car payment and don't want to start now)so we found out that the 1994 had a bigger engine in it and was still in our price range ($4000-$6000).  
We found what we wanted and bought it.  We've had it for just over a year now and I've had no problems with it.  
It was even the vehicle that I used to take the kids up skiing in the mountains for 7 weeks in a row! It handled better than I expected - I only fishtailed one time and that was very minor.  I made it up safely all 7 times (or I wouldn't be writing this, now would I?!) 
 It handles nicely on the highway although it does seem to kick into passing gear more easily than I'd like (A little surprising sometimes) and I think that the transmission is starting to have some problems (tough to get into reverse sometimes, seems to be a delay between moving the shifter and the van going into gear)
  The only other con is that the rear seat requires 2 people to remove and is quite heavy.  I can remove the middle seat by myself but it's still a struggle.  <br><br>
