            My husband just bought this truck the other day. He has been waiting to buy one for a while now. He used to have a silverado, as well, but it was year 1984. The one he just bought is year 2000. It's newer and more improved. 

The shifting in the truck is very easy. It has such a great transmission that the ride is always smooth and never bumpy. In my opinion it rides better then a Grand Jeep Cherokee. 

The back seat is very roomy, enough space for three people. This makes it very comfortable, unlike the Ford F150, which has very little room in the back and it is very uncomfortable and hard to relax. Even though it can fit so many people it still has that truck look, if you know what I mean.

The interior is leather, everyone likes leather. The two front seats can be heated, which makes it even more comfortable, especially on long trips. 

It includes a am/fm radio and cd player. It is a very dependable truck and already my husband is in love with it. I think I might be a little jealous. 

The stirring is very easy to control and it handles the road easy and safely.  So if this doesn't prove to be a great truck to you then I really don't know what would. <br><br>
