            Man, I love my new 2004 Optima.  This is my third Kia. Traded in my 1999 Sephia for this car.  Also own a 2003 Spectra.  I've been buying Kias because I'm frugal and always looking for a good value.  Never had a problem with any of them.  But it is amazing how the quality has jumped over the last 5 years.
The Optima is no Benz but for the price it has most of the bells and whistles: ac, cruise, power windows/locks, cd, etc.
I opted for the 4 cylinder manual and had to wait 2 days for delivery.  My dealer gave me a brand new V-6, automatic to drive while waiting for my car.  The V-6 has quite a kick, it'll toss your head back when you punch it.
Very smooth transmission, the "shiftronic" was pretty cool.  Highly recommended.
I'm a tall guy (6'3") and the Optima has tons of leg/head room.  Seats are very wide and comfortable.  The ride is a little soft in the corners but makes it very quiet and smooth cruising on the road.
There is nothing "tinny" about this car.  Everything seems very tight and well built.
I chose "Cream Gold" as the color.  Hides the dirt well.
The best warranty around: 10 year power train, 5 year bumper-to-bumper, 5 year free roadside assistance (run out of gas, lock your keys in the car, flat tire, etc.)
Definitley give it a test drive!
