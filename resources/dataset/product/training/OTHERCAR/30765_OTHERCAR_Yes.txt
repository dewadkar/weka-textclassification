            The Olympus D-340R is an excellent camera for the money!  I purchased this camera for my wife for Christmas, and we BOTH love it.  Because of the megapixel quality, superior aspherical lens, and the 8MB smart media card, you get a camera that can produce top quality pictures. One aspect that might put off some people is the fact that it does not have an optical zoom, while it does have a digital zoom (crops the image bigger at a lower resolution).  Well, you can buy an extra attachment to have an optical zoom, but for the most part this is the ONE lacking feature of the camera.  The user should probably think if he/she is going to need to take pictures at a distance with this camera.  Other than this, the Olympus D-340R is a superior camera, especially for the price.<br><br>
