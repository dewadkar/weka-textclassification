            I owna 01 Corvette, which int he NE can not be a daily driver. thus I needed a daily driver, and the GT1 Coupe is the closest I could come to what I wanted. 

The traction control and ABS are great, and are something I am used to and were on the priority list. The Monsoon system is *believe it or not* better than the absolutely ridiculously poor performing system GM puts in the 'vette that costs twice as much.

The performance of the car is good when compared to its competitors such as the Corolla and Civic. Definitely miles ahead of the Celica in my humble opinion. 

The car is easy to drive, and does not misbehave on wet/snowy roads. But that was the reason I bought it.All in all it does provide a great bang for the buck.<br><br>
