            The 1980-1991 S-Class sedans defined the image for what most people probably think of when they hear the word &quot;Mercedes&quot;. This generation of S-Class made its merits on bank vault-like solidity (a popular showroom demonstration was to slam the doors shut as hard as you could to hear the reassuring &quot;thunk&quot;), autobahn touring (driving at 120 mph for 6 hours or more), and supreme crash safety and reliability (many S-Class cars would reach their &quot;first&quot; million miles).

The 1986-1989 S-Class offered some mid-life refinements, most noticably in engine choices and facelifted body panels. The last round of refinements appeared in 1990-1991 with soft leather seating and door inserts.

I have experience with the 1990 and 1991 years of the 300SE. The 3.0-liter inline-6-cylinder engine is peppy, screaming up to its redline at every upshift, considering the weight is has to deal with, but it is somewhat hampered by the transmission which starts from rest in 2nd gear (unless you open the throttle 100%, which is followed by a less-than-smooth kick-down and neck-snapping launch).

The automatic climate control is archaic. There are two fan speeds (very low, and very high) and overall operation of the automatic setting is unsatisfactory.

The car is large and heavy and drives like it around town. Out on the highway, this car excels. An interstate trip is as comfortable as spending an afternoon on your living room sofa ... at 80 or 100 mph! A more nimble driving S-Class debuted in 1992, and the 2000 S-Class is said to be more nimble even still. Evolution improves the breed, it seems, when it comes to handling dynamics.

Still, the 1990 300SE is a classic luxury car and I'm always enamoured when I'm behind the wheel. Its a feeling that is shared by all drivers of any S-Class Mercedes, no matter what model year it was built.<br><br>
