                 I originally purchased this vehicle because I moved to Alaska in 1999 with a Mazda Miata-not a good snow car.  I needed a vehicle with 4WD and some clearance at a price I could afford.  I read several favorable reviews for the Kia Sportage, especially lauding the 4WD system.  I have to say that after the first winter, I was very impressed with the 4WD; I never got stuck and traction was excellent.  New tires help, and I wonder if a year of wear on the tires will significantly affect the handling. I like the turning radius on the Kia, although sometimes it seems the vehicle is unstable in U-turns (wheels don't leave the ground, but you get more of a sensation of &quot;tipping&quot; than with other vehicles.)  I purchased the 2 door soft top, and am regretting not getting the 5 door.  The top is fairly quiet and well insulated, but only opens up over the back section, and takes at least 5 minutes to put back on (not great if caught in the rain.)  Very little storage in the convertible, not good for Costco trips.  The Sportage drives nicely; poor acceleration but an overall good ride.  I have the 5 speed manual transmission, which is pretty touchy (easy to grind.)  The Sportage is a good vehicle if you are on a limited budget and need a vehicle with good 4WD, but I would only recommend the convertible for those in a sunny climate where you can predictably leave the top off for days at a time.   <br><br>
