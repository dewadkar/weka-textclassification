            My brother owns a 1987 454 dually with custom bed.  This truck is a power house, with the 454 putting out loads of torque.  The 3500 series has ample load capacity, and the 454 engine leaves little to be desired in acceleration.  We have towed several trailers with this truck, and none of them even made it blink. 

We also regularly haul wood on it, and the springs don't even compress.  As it is my little brothers, this truck is tortured, and yet it comes through every time. The dual battery approach assures starting, and the 454 is happy to run rain or shine.

The interior is a bit dated, with a functional but plain dash/instrument cluster.  But what do you expect from a 1987 truck? The seats are comfortable, his version having leather.  I cannot vouch for the cloth seats.  The leather ones do not have tilt or adjustment other than back and forth (closer/farther away from dash) but they are still fairly comfortable.

This is a work truck not a luxury mobile.  It was built when trucks were for work, not for driving people off the 435 expressway in KC on your way to a desk job.  You would be lucky to get 10 MPG with it, due to the massive displacement engine and weight.  Overall, a good work truck, but not a economy vehicle by any means
