            I bought a Tracker last June, trading in my much beloved Ford Taurus.  After moving to the north from Texas, and driving in the snow for two winters, it was time for 4WD.  I didn't want a big monster vehicle, I was used to driving a car.  A small pick up also wasn't a practical option, as the main things I haul are kids, dogs and groceries.

I am very happy with my Tracker, I call it my 4WD car.  It has room for the kids and their friends, and also a fair amount of groceries.  With the rear seat folded down, I have also hauled a recliner and shower doors.

I have had a problem with the kill switch in the clutch, (OK, well, 3 times, but it seems to be fixed for good now).  Also, there was a recall on the rear brake lights, but mine went out before I got the notice.  Thank goodness for kind people, or I might have been rear ended without ever knowing there was a problem.

Everything is working fine now, and it certainly solves my problem of getting through snow while carrying a load of kids.<br><br>
