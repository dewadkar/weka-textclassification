            I bought a 93 Grand Voyager LE new in December 1992. It was loaded. With tax and tags it ended up costing about 25k. I was thrilled to be buying an american car. Previously to this I had a Toyota and a Mazda. The car had the following problems: battery exploded, starter failed, brakes failed (bad ABS unit), doors automatically lock themselves. One time the water pump failed on a family vacation and left my family stranded in Red Bluff California for three days. Two years later the transmission failed on another family vacation and left us stranded in Mamouth California for one week. The power steering pump failed. In addition there were lots of small problems with things like the fuel filler door and the windshield wipers. It was recalled for several other items. At the end of last year it developed a tapping in the engine. I ended up donating it to a local church and took the tax write-off. I am so much happier now that I don't have to deal with that lemmon anymore. If your thinking about a chrysler minivan, I suggest that you forget about chrysler and check out the others. They have got to be better.<br><br>
