               I love this car!  This is the second Legacy I've owned.  My first was a 1992 Legacy Sedan.  I drove it for seven years without any significant problems.  The only problem I had in seven years was the visor breaking.  It wouldn't stay up.  Before I had a chance to get it fixed, I was in an accident which totally destroyed the car.  My family and I walked away with nothing more than bumps and bruises.  I'm convinced that the only reason I'm still alive is the great quality and design of that car.
    My 2000 Legacy Wagon is improved in many ways over my previous Legacy.  It's quieter, has a smoother ride, better handling, fantastic exterior design, and better interior design.  It looks and feels so sporty, I don't feel like I'm making any sacrifice driving a Wagon.  You can store plenty of cargo, even with the back seat up.  If you fold the back seat down, you have a cavernous amount of cargo capacity.  The new standard engine has 165 horsepower.  It's a very noticeable increase in power.  The roof-rack system will hold a variety of things such as Ski's, Bikes, or luggage, depending on what attachments you buy for it.  The All-Wheel-Drive System is fantastic!  This car is an unstoppable &quot;Bear&quot; in the snow.  Unlike SUV's, which only use their 4-Wheel Drive in the snow, or off-road, Subaru's All-Wheel-Drive works great in the rain, as well.  This car does everything well, and is incredibly reliable.  I strongly recommend this car to anyone in the market for a &quot;Family&quot; vehicle.
