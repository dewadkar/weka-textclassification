            As a mother of two children, I need a fast and easy camera. This was my first purchase of a digital camera. I went to WalMart and asked the sales person about the different cameras in the $200 range. He suggested the Polaroid PDC-700. It had the highest resolution of all the cameras and also had 3 choices of resolution. The resolutions store 12,25 & 50 pictures. With a flashcard the picture storage is doubled. 
The kids can take all the pics of each other they want and no film is wasted. When a picture is taken the camera gives you about 3 seconds to delete or keep the picture. There are also easy to use buttons on the back of the camera to navigate through the different functions and options.
With the view screen on the back it is easy to see what is in the viewfinder without putting the camera to your eye. Although, if you use the view screen with the batteries, they will only last about 5 minutes. 
It comes with cables for computer hook-up and works with many Photography Programs such as Adobe Photo Deluxe and PhotoMax. 
The only negative comments I have is batter life and no zoom. If you want to use the camera more than 10 minutes then you better take your power cable, which is only about 6 ft long, or have a pocket full of batteries. Although there is no zoom, the photo programs allow me to crop and enlarge. 
I sell doll clothes on ebay and this is the way to go. I can take a picture and have it ready for ebay in a matter of minutes. 
Overall, I am happy with this camera for the price I paid for it. I will eventually upgrade, but for now, me and the kids are having a blast.
