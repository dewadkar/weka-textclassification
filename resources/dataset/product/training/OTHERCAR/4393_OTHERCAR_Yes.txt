            I had a van from another maker taken back by the Lemon Law -- the vehicle had needed so much work that I was in the dealer every 2000 miles for a repair! (the guy at the dealership repair place and I were on a first name basis -- &quot;Hi Kevin? This is Susan. Want to guess what light went off this time?!&quot; --  I was so sick and tired of spending my days at the dealership, that when I went shopping the next time, I went HONDA!  

I had owned a Honda Civic many years before and it was such a dream that I was hoping to repeat that experience.  I started this shopping trip by letting my fingers do the walking.... I hit the yellow pages, called the local Honda dealers and asked what they had that seated 7. We have 6 people in our immediate family and like to be able to have at least one extra seat for a friend or relative. (not that too many people are excited to travel around with this size family... but some do!)

At that point, not all the Honda places had Odyssee's in stock, so we had to do a little driving to see one.  My first thought was that it looked a little small (the van that was taken back by the Lemon Law mentioned earlier was quite large) But after taking a test drive I decided it was actually the best of two worlds -- something between a van and a station wagon. 

It drove very smoothly and the kids were able to fit comfortably in both the back rows (this model seats 3 in the second row and 2 in the last row -- but they do have some with bucket seats in the second row). Since this purchase, the kids have grown and now the last row is a little small for my oldest (at 5'7&quot;) for long periods of time.

The second row folds up and the third seat folds down -- making all sorts of different ways to travel depending on your needs.... As I mentioned, we have lots of people in our group and therefore we tend to use all the rows of seats.  The storage area in the back is a little small so we had a roof rack added to ours for extra luggage capacity.

The gas mileage is pretty good for a van -- we generally get between 21 and 24 MPG in our driving (which is usually a combination of highway and city driving).  

Currently we have about 95,000 miles on our Odyssee and to this date it has not gone to the shop for a single repair (other than normal maintenance -- oil change, new brakes, tires, etc).  

This summer we have plans to drive across country (second time with this car) -- all 6 of us and our 70 pound golden retriever plus luggage to hold this crowd for 10 days.... (I can almost see how jealous you are!)   

We bought this Odyssee in August of 1996 (and it is a 1996 model) and there has not been one day that I have regretted the decision. With 4 children to taxi around we are a good test of how something will hold up and the Odyssee has been holding up great

**I updated the title to include the model year because although I originally listed this in the correct place it seems to have been moved to the 2000 model area.  When I ran a search under Honda Odyssee it pulled up this Epinion so I am hoping it is okay to leave it here....  Feel free to email me with any questions you might have! Thanks for reading.
