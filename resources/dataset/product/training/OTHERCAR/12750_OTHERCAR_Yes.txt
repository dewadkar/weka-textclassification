            I bought my MX-2700 because my brother got a different Fujifilm camera for Christmas and I liked it, and because a friend had one and impressed me with its ability to take good closeup photos of model railroads, and because it's small--the camera to buy is the one you'll be willing to carry with you! The MX-2700, with its high resolution (1800x1200 pixels) seemed as though it would make it possible to take pictures, crop them in software, and still have plenty of resolution left. 

And it's great! I can slip the camera in any pocket, the pictures are excellent, especially the model photos, but I've liked the light and color rendition under all conditions; I think the results stack up well compared with both slide and print film, and I can get quite acceptable printouts from my nothing-special color printer, even at 8x10 size. No, ultimately the number of pixels won't match 35mm film, but it's very, very good. If you're taking pictures to post on the Web, you'll never hear a complaint. It has an internal lens cover that pops open with a nice businesslike 'snap' when you switch the unit on, then closes when you turn it off. No separate cover to lose.

I have the impression that the equivalent of &quot;shutter speed&quot; is rather slow. I've seen images come out blurred if something is moving where I think a point-and-shoot would have got a clear picture. 

My major complaint is that downloading those big pictures via a serial port is unbearably slow. The saving grace is that you can tell it &quot;Download all&quot; and walk away from it. But why can't they have direct-from-camera USB? I'll end up getting that USB SmartMedia adapter, for sure. 

I said 100-200 exposures on the battery life but really I don't know. Since I always recharge it every time I download anything I've never found out its limit.

I paid $545 for the camera on Ebay, which was the going rate a few months ago but it's down below $500 now.

They ask &quot;Recommend to a friend?&quot; Well, I have a friend who accused me of costing him $500 because &quot;Now I gotta get one!&quot;
