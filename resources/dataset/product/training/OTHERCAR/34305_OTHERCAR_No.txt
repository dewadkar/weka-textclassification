            Well I chalk it up to my frugal Dutch background always looking for a bargain, but I have a story to tell about <b>Musek MDC 4000 </b> digital camera.  My first digital camera was when I was on AOL four years ago and they had a digital camera for sale which I ordered.  It was an OK camera for my first experience and I took loads of pictures with it, simple and easy.  Well I updated my computer from Windows 95 to 98 then to XP which made downloading the pictures an interesting experience but I worked it out.  Then this summer the catch on the battery lid broke and I improvised and held it together with a wide rubber band.  See the Dutch thing coming out again.  Well I decided I better look for a new Digital Camera.  I had just sent my granddaughter and her new husband a Kodak Digital with docking station for their wedding.  She was getting outstanding pictures so I should have ordered two.  

I started to read Howard Creech&#146s outstanding reviews on Digital Cameras and was fascinated by his great reviews and trips he took with his friend to try them out.  I keep getting interested until it came to the BOTTOM LINE and that was the price.  I just could not see $500 to $600 or more for something I would just be fooling around with.   It had nothing to do with Howard&#146s great reviews it had to do with the prices.  When you have lived through a depression, raising five kids looking for bargains it is a way of life.

Well anyway late one night around midnight when I could not sleep I was surfing the channels on TV and up popped the Home Shopping Network with a Digital Camera.  I was mesmerized and thought what amazing things this camera could do and then the price hit me $169.00.  I did not want to call as I have never done that before but saw they had a web site so rushed to the computer and brought it up.  Sure enough there it was and in my worse moment without checking things out I ordered it.  Now on to my experience with this <b>Mustek MDC 4000 </b>

When this camera arrived I could not believe the size it looked like a deck of cards.  It came with a printed out instruction folder that included three other languages.  It wasn&#146t too hard to figure out how the thing worked, the thing that did surprise me was it only took two AA Alkaline batteries, not rechargeable but Alkaline and I thought TWO.  I thought that is why the thing is so small because of the two batteries.  Well this camera eats them up fast.  My son told me to try the lithium ones and they do last longer.  Since I do not go out on long shooting expeditions it now is OK.  I did take my first AOL Camera, this new one and my 35 mm one to the park for a trial run like Howard.  I can see him laughing but I needed some pictures for my e-book I was working on.

Well there you have it everything you ever wanted to know about this camera and my comments.  It has kept me busy trying to figure out all the things and still have not tried the camcorder or the other things incorporated in this camera.  One thing that did surprise me was they included a small 8&#148 tripod, just could not figure that one out.  I did attach it to the camera for the self timer thing, but had no trouble with blurry pictures.  Maybe because I am rock solid steady when snapping pictures no tremors in these hands. LOL!

The software that came with all these features I downloaded with ease.  The camera features the Super VGA card which is not included but I purchases one and really did not need it.  There is a small space where this is inserted into the camera.  The battery chamber is small for those two batteries, so keep extra ones handy.  There is a small rubber cover where you insert the USB and Video connection.  The pocket reader just inserts in your PC and reads your pictures from the card automatically.  One day was ready to download some pictures and grabbed up a regular USB cable and inserted it into the camera and computer and automatically it downloaded, so did not need the card reader or remove the card.  

I was not too sold on the software called PhotoExpress SE, Photo Explorer and Cool 360.  I just download everything to My Pictures on Microsoft and then work on them in another software that I like to use.  Many of the good features were missing on these new ones, but will have to check it all out further.  When you are used to using something it is easier to just go there than work with something new.  I don&#146t think I will ever need the panorama shots, but then who know after trying out new things. 
As far as the pictures I have taken they have come out fine, when I was experimenting I got some weird colors.  I found out when shooting thing inside that this camera is light sensitive as I have to close down the settings as it lets in too much light.  Don&#146t need the flash unless it is fairly dark or take a full room pictures inside.  The macro settings for close ups worked fine for taking pictures of books for sale on half.com.  I shut off the LCD when taking pictures outside as you can&#146t see them anyway and a way to save battery juices. 

I downloaded a lot of information from the internet which was not supplied with this camera.  Of course they were all praising it as a Shoot, Store, Style, and Share camera.  Of course you can fix the red-eye but never had any problem with this anyway.  I have printed some of the pictures out but nothing bigger than 5x7 mostly smaller and on regular paper.  I am using most of these pictures in various sizes and shapes for my e-book I am working on.  A small black bag with drawn string came with the camera for storing and to carry around.  It fit nicely in my pants pocket when I was out taking scenic pictures at the lake, with my 35mm hanging around my neck and AOL hanging on my wrist.  I really looked like I was a big time photographer, but there was hardly anyone out there to see me.  LOL!

I still think I am in the market for another Digital Camera as I would not recommend this one as of now.  Since most of my photos are snap and shoot style so can&#146t take the time with this little thing to work out the settings for each shot.  As I said before when you go cheap you get cheap, this camera was made in China and the Mustek name I was familiar with as my first scanner was a Mustek and it worked great until I had to upgrade.  So maybe with time I can work out the kink in this one until a better deal comes along.  There was that Dutch talk coming out again. I read the other reviews for this camera and I believe they all must have watched the same Home Shopping Network show.  There are more gullible people in this world than just me.   BE WISE WHEN SHOPPING A SPUR OF THE MOMENT IMPULSE CAN SOMETIMES BE A DISASTER!!
