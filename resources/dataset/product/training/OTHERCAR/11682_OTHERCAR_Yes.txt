            I just bought my self a 1997 Subaru Outback last year. And it wasn't the commercial that made me buy it either. I had my heart set on a little SUV like the Rav4 or Honda CRV. I decided the best way was to test drive both SUV before I make my decision. But after test driving both models, I was not convince either model was best for the price offered. So I looked towards the Subaru Outback Sports. For the price, with all the standard feature like ABS and AWD (additional cost in Rav4 and Honda CRV). I fell in the with the little Outback Sports and sign with deal that very same day I test drove the car. It was a rainy day when I test drove the Outback. It handled the road beautifully. I did the figure 8 test and it grip on the road pretty tightly. The brake was efficient, there was a couple of times I had to do the emergency brake. I stopped straight forward and it didn't slip or turned like some other cars do. The acceleration of this vehicle is fast and responsive. The only draw back is the space is bit cramp. Who should buy this Outback Sports? If you are average height and single needing only basic transportation. For the price and features, I highly recommend it. If you are a family man look into a bigger model like Legacy Outback or the Forester.<br><br>
