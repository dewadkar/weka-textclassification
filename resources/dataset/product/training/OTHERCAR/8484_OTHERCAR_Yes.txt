            I was given a check at Christmas time from a close family member with the stipulation that my husband and I buy something for the whole family.  Ok. Easy.  Our first thought was that what our family really needed was a digital camera.  Truth be told, being the real gadget lover and home computer nerd in the family, I really pushed the issue.  I mentioned that it would be so great to send pictures, via email, of our kids so easily to our family spread across the country - how easy it would now be to maintain our family web sites, how great storage of photos on cd really was.  I even dangled the fact that I could now photograph all the spare stuff (other gadgets) lying around our house and then could sell them on ebay and turn a profit.  After only a little cajoling, my husband agreed.  

I started looking into all the options available.  Should I spend our entire Christmas gift on one $1000 camera?  Should I buy a real cheap one and use the extra money for something else?  I finally narrowed down the features that I really needed with the hope that I could then have a price range to work with.  The features that I needed/wanted were a decent optical zoom (at least 3x), at least 2 mega pixel pictures, fully automatic, ease of transferring the pictures to my computer and general ease of use.  What I found?  Well, prices ranged from $550 down.  What a list.  Seems that what I wanted was what was in most mid-priced digitals.  Ok, so what now?  I started from the bottom and worked up.  Almost right from the start, I kept reading good things about the Fuji FinePix 2600z.  It was one of the cheaper ones on my list, so I at first ignored it, thinking, "You get what you pay for." Well, the more I researched, the more I found that in this case, what you get is FAR more than what you pay.  

This camera comes with everything I had initially hoped and then some.  It came standard with a battery charger and a 16mb smartmedia card (8 was the norm).  It also operates on 2 AA batteries in a pinch.  The shutter lag time (which I found was a big issue when trying to photograph fast moving toddlers) was really good.  There is a lens cover built into the camera.  The controls are very easy to use and there is an option manual mode.  I suppose the one drawback would have to be the manual mode, which I've never used, but was used by my hobbyist photographer brother.  He didn't like them at all.  Oh well.  The software that came with the camera is very easy to use.  The picture quality is fantastic.  I've taken pictures in all different environments and lighting conditions and I've had very good results.   The camera is small and lightweight and EASILY fits into my purse.  I've since purchased an ac adapter and additional 32mb card.  

Recently I had the pleasure of an outing with a mom friend of mine.  She was toting a very large Sony CD camera.  I'm talking MONSTER size, and probably with a price tag to match.  All day she kept admiring my camera, trying it out, seeing what it did.  By the end of the day she had written down the model number and vowed to get herself a 2nd camera.
I also recently ran into a family member who is a TRUE technophile with the money to finance a very good collection of electronic gadgets, the most recent things being digital cameras.  I wasn't sure what he had been using, but he was thoroughly surprised to see that all the photos I had been sending out lately had come from this tiny little, inexpensive camera.  

In the end, after 4 mths of continuous use, I've found that this camera is a great first step into the digital world.  It didn't break the bank and I've gotten raves reviews for what it does.    I would certainly recommend this camera to the 'real life' person who just wants to play around with digital and send pictures of their smiling babies to aunts and uncles across the country.
