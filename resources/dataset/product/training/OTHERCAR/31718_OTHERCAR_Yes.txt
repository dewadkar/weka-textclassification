            The 2000 Dodge Intrepid is a lot of car for the price. It is big, roomy and has lots of space both inside for passengers, and in the trunk for their gear. It drives smoothly and responsively, but it has a few faults. My first complaint is the noise. On smooth roads, it is fairly quiet. But on anything rough, or even with a less than smooth surface, the car transmits a loud low frequency rumble into the passenger compartment that drowns out the radio and conversation. To me it was very annoying, and surprising. My regular car is a 1999 Blazer, and the Blazer is definitely quieter than the Intrepid, believe it or not! (Not as smooth riding, but quieter)
The second complaint has to do with vision to the rear of the vehicle. While the styling of the Intrepid is very sporty and the high rear end is a big part of that styling, the high rear end causes sight problems when you are backing up. Even for someone who is as tall as I am- 6'2&quot; - you'll have trouble seeing out over the tail of the Intrepid. 
Finally, the roominess and big trunk make this a big car, and that means it's harder to park and manipulate in parking lots than a more compact vehicle. 
On the up side, the Intrepid gets great gas mileage, especially on the road. Over 1300 miles, I got between 26 and 30 miles per gallon in a mix of city and mostly turnpike and interstate driving. Pretty impressive for a car this big. It has aerodynamic styling, and I am sure that helps the mileage on the road, especially at higher speeds.
So the Intrepid is a car to buy if you are looking for a roomy and economical car with plenty of room for four or even five adults (and all their luggage) as long as you don't mind a little road noise. Or if the roads you travel on are all nice and smooth (not likely).
Maybe after a while you get used to the noise, but I drove mine for over 1300 miles this past weekend, on a trip to Ohio, and it annoyed me the entire trip. 
Noise is a subjective thing, so you may want to try one out. I had the same complaint in a 1999 Chrysler Concorde that I drove to Florida last year- too much noise from the front tires. The Chrysler Concorde is basically the same car as the Intrepid- I was hoping that they had figured out how to muffle that noise this year, but my experience is that the folks at Daimler-Chrysler still have a bit of work to do to really make these cars good road cruisers.<br><br>
