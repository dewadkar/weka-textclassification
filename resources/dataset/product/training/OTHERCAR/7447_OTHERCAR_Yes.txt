            I rented a 4 cyclinder car with almost 20K abusive miles (someone ripped off the vanity mirror and the sides were dented). It had lots of pep, could climb 6% grades with ease, it was quiet, smooth and I got over 30 MPG. A 4  cyclinder Grand Am/Alero is a good deal because dealers have a hard time moving them off their lot, since the sticker difference between the 4 and 6 is minimal. Therefore they should give you a better deal. This car has traction control and ABS standard, features normally found standard on luxury imports. Also note that Nissan Altimas cannot be found on dealer's lots with ABS and Traction control is not available on 4 cyclinder Camrys, Accords, etc. This car is as roomy as the Accord/Camry, it comes in cooler colors (Fire Engine Red, Jet Black, etc). The power height control standard on the driver's seat (like the EX Honda Accord) and tilt wheel makes it easy to fit very short and very tall drivers. Also cool is the red-lighted guages and the kick-ass sound systems standard. In addition, the good gas milage and big fuel tank allow the car to go over 450 miles per fill up. Fold down rear seat let you carry things like a SUV. Also Fog lamps are standard. Another neat feature is the standard door lock system. When you get out, if you press the power door lock button once and slam the door, a few seconds later the doors will lock them selves, honk the horn and flash the lights to confirm this. But if you press the button twice the door lock will lock them selves. But to keep you safe, the car will not lock the doors if you left you key in the
 ignition. I also like the automatic headlights. When lights are needed they go on automatically and go off automatically when it gets light out. <br><br>
