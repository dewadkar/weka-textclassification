            We bought a used 1995 Plymouth Voyager in 1999.  After having it for a year now I can say that we made the right choice.  We researched every type of minivan on the market today during our search.  The Plymouth Voyager was not our first choice by any means.  We knew that we didn't want a Caravan after reading so many negative reviews.  Even the Voyager was a little skeptical since it was a like maker.  We did find this van with a price within our means, so we took it.  I have had no regrets.  I made sure to get the oil change every 3000 miles and check ups. I have never had one problem with this van...not one.  It rides smooth and quiet as if I bought it new.  I think the thing to remember on any vehicle is maintenance.  Don't let the oil changes and tune ups go.  As long as you take car of your vehicle, it'll take care of you.  I trust this van with my two children in it, so you know that means a lot.  I don't think I would hesitate to purchase another Plymouth product in the future; which in all honesty, I never thought I'd find myself saying.<br><br>
