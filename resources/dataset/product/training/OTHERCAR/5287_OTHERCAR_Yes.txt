            The Honda Accord is the typical family car.  It is a good choice not only because it is affordably priced, but it is also large, stylish, and laden with features.  It provides almost untouchable reliability and quality, although it seems as though the latest model of the Accord (1998-2001) is slipping in quality.  I notice that there is more road noise in a '98 EX than there is in a '97 LX.  Is it the fault of the tires?  Another good thing is that the transmission couldn't shift any smoother, unlike that of the previous models.  The engine is definitely very strong at all times, if you get an LX or an EX.  Don't get me wrong, the DX provides strong acceleration, but it is nothing to brag about.  The tires are very grippy, and the ABS seems to work seamlessly (I have had a chance to test it, unfortunately).  There are certainly more squeaks and rattles in the new model, and the transmission is prone to slipping.  The air conditioner finally cools the car with guts, not a wimpy stream of air that becomes cool only when you reach your destination.  The suspension is a bit firm, but the seats more than make up for that.  On a long trip, no fatigue was noticed.  Kudos to the designers who made those seats!  

Another note:  The seat fabric is the richest I have yet encountered.  Smooth and silky against the skin; something that I have never thought about before.<br><br>
