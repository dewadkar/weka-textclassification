            This is a car I purchased because all I had heard on T.V. about reliability, mileage and resale value. Well I picked up my new toy. 
Drove it for a while and was the happiest person in the world. I was getting 50 plus miles per gallon and it handled will around 
town. The first thing I noticed about it was even on city streets I would have to shift into 4th or 5th gear other wise it would sound 
like it was revving to high. I would put it into reverse and let the clutch out and it would pop out of gear. I would go to shift from 
one foreword gear to enough and some times it wouldn't go into gear. I had it into the dealer ship several times and they tried to tell 
my it was because the floor mat was under the clutch peddle or in general it was my fault. So needless to say, in general the car 
worked well but I wouldn't recommend it. I also went to several dealers to use it for a trade in and after about a year and a half 
Not one would give me more than $3500.00 on a trade in.<br><br>
