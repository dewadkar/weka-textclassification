            I just purchased my 1995 chevrolet lumina.  It has a 3.4 liter dohc v-6 with dual exhaust.  I am a regular racer and many people put me down for buying a family car.  But when we line up and I whoop them off the line, they aren't laughing as loud.  Lumina's are excellent family cars, and when you get the big six's, they can be pretty sporty.  I think anybody can own this car, I mean I am only 18 and I love my lumina, but then again I love all chevy products.  The lumina's comfort and design as far as interior could be a little nicer, but comfort is great.  I do wish however I could have gotten bucket seats like the monte carlo, but hey, beggers can't be chosers.  I hope my opinion on this excellent car has been of worth to you, because this is the perfect car, heck for anybody.<br><br>
