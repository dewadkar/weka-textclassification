A SENSE OF SECURITY
While parked on a street in Pittsburgh, a drunk driver decides to take out 5 parked cars at 2 am, ours being second in line.  Our 99 :( Grand Caravan took a heavy blow to the Driver Side Rear.  It is currently in repair, so I can't say how it will operate after the repair, but 2 panels were damaged and the rear axle damaged.  As crumpled as the rear left corner was, the one thing that impressed us was the little-to-no damage to the interior.  The only thing that was affected was the cover to the jack compartment popping off.  There was no crumpling on the inside.  That gave us a decent sense of security as to the crash-test safety of the vehicle.
