            We managed to find a 2000 Oddy EX with 13,000 miles on it and in good shape, so it's now in our driveway.

Good points:
The EX's automatic doors take some getting used to but I'm really becoming a fan of them. 
Also, the middle seats can be removed, setup as captain's chairs, or combined into a bench - VERY nice flexibility. And, of course, the rear seat magically flips out of sight smoothly. (As a side note, the 2000 and 2001 Mazda MPV vans also have these seating features as well plus the ability of the rear seat to flip aroung backwards for tailgating, etc. HOWEVER, the interior of the MPV is noticably smaller and I still trust the Honda engine over the MPV's. The MPV is a lot cheaper than the Oddy though, so if you don't have the $$$ for an Oddy, check out the MPV).
You'll also love the hideway "Happy Meal" trey between the 2 front seats. Very well designed.
The Honda engine has GREAT pick-up - holy cow this van can get up and boogie.

A few cons:
The gear shift is akwardly placed on the steering column. Causing confusion and sometimes accidental shifts on the driver's part. I am getting better at working with it BUT the Honda engineers really need to take a look at how they have implemented it.
Also, the sound system is poor for a van that is so expensive. Sound is subdued and tinny.
The newer Oddy's are hard to find and are in demand so don't expect to be able to dicker over the price too much or be too demanding on colors, accessories unless you are willing to wait.
