            Before I bought this vehicle, I looked at other SUVs and crew cab pickups from all the major manufacturers. The Montero Sport LS has standard features that are optional on others for a lower price. The 1.9% interest rate was also a selling point.

Likes - Standard features - both operational (cruise, 16" wheels and tires, independent suspension and full sway bars, large cargo area with powerpoint, 60-40 folding rear seat) and cosmetic (tinted windows, running boards, fender flares) that are optional on other brands. This is the only one of the vehicles that I tested that my wife and two growing children felt comfortable in both the front and the back. The ride is smooth and controlled. The cabin is quiet, even on the highway. Mirrors are tall, which gives a better view of the road behind. Ground clearance of about 9" even with two wheel drive helps give a good forward and side view of the traffic.

Not Liked As Much - The brake pedal has a longer travel than I'm used to. ABS would be good even as an option. Although I live in the Southeast where bad weather is not as common, I feel that ABS would increase the safety factor.
