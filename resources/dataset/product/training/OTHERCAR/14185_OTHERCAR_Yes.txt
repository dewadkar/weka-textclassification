            Purchasing a used car is very difficult in that no two cars are exactly alike and therefore hard to compare price. The Chryler LHS has all equipment as standard other than the moon roof and/or special wheels. It is therefore easy to compare prices with various dealers as the only variable is the mileage. It should be noted that the car takes a large loss the first few years thereby giving the 2nd buyer alot of car for the money. In the south Florida area a two year old  LHS with low mileage can be bought for at least $10,000 less than the original list price. This is bad for the original buyer but great for the 2nd purchaser. The 1997 LHS had proven to be an excellent car in that it is large, with much interior room. The motor is peppy and overall the car is excellent. One problem is with outside noise. The wind can be heard coming thru some of the windows. The car is not the most economical to drive with gas mileage good for a car of this size but still higher than many of us who are use to driving a smaller foreign car.<br><br>
