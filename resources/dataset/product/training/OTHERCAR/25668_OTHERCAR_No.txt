            This was my first digital camera, bought 2 years ago, for $250 at PC Richards.
This camera features 2.3 megapixel resolution. Many tout it as a beginners camera, but getting good pictures is not as easy as &#147point and shoot&#148. Also use NiMH rechargable AA batteries, because you wont be able to take more than 20 photos before your alkalines run out. And the included compactflash card is not nearly large enough, I had to buy one for 32mb.
Taking my first photos with the camera, especially in open spaces with bright sunlight, using standard resolution, came out dark. I found I had to adjust exposure compensation in those situations to +0.5 or +1.0.
Also since the camera is not that quick, and the autofocus takes 2-5 seconds to work, getting decent photos will take some time and effort.
In low-light situations this camera is not very good. Images will come out dark or blurry. 
The camera lacks optical zoom, and only has 2.0 digital zoom. Digital zoom is fairly useless as it just crops the photos. And often the zoomed photos will look very muddy, even at qualities higher than standard.
There are only 2 ISO settings, one for normal and one for high. High ISO is not quick enough for clear low light situations. 
One can get good photos with this camera, but be prepared to make adjustments and position yourself carefully. This is not a good camera for quick action or low light situations.
