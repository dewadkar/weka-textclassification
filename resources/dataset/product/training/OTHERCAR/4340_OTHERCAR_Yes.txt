            My husband and I bought a 1999 GMC Savana conversion van last Spring.  We had previously owned a Chevrolet conversion van and although made by the same company there is a real difference.  It has a much smoother, quiet ride and roomier than the Chevrolet.
This is something we really have to take into consideration because I am wheelchair bound and cannot stand riding in bumpy cars that would exacerbate my pain.
It is very easy on gas.  My husband drives round trip about 60 miles a day and only has to fill up the gas tank once a week and at the price of gasoline right now it's another big plus.
The back seat that makes into a bed is so comfortable on long rides and even for taking on an overnight camping trip and with the 8 cylinder engine pulls our boat as if we have nothing being pulled behind us.
We were really put to the test in February this year.  My husband was on his way to work and stopped in a line of traffic at a red light.  A woman hit him from behind at an estimated speed of 40 MPH shoving him into the truck in front of him.  Thanks to the way the frame is made it helps absorb the impact and he did not receive any major injuries.  The only problem we found with the van was on impact the back part of the driver's seat broke and fell backwards.  It is something we're contacting GMC about.
The only &quot;con&quot; I can think of is without having a wheelchair lift for the van it's very hard to get into because the side runners are so narrow to step on I have difficulty getting into the van.
I would highly recommend this van to everyone.  For the quality and price you can't go wrong and their warranty is very good.
Our van is being repaired at an authorized GMC dealership and we're very impressed that instead of straightening or pulling out dents or whatever they are replacing all the damaged parts with new ones.  They've replaced both rear doors, the whole front end, and the rear panel on the passenger side because it had buckled on impact. We're very impressed that they would go to this length to get our van back to the way it looked and ran before the accident.
I hope this helps anyone who is thinking about buying a conversion van.<br><br>
