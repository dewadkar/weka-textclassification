            The X5 is BMW's first foray into the SUV market.While many major car makers including Porsche are entering into this lucrative market,BMW has done a lot of research before committing itself.On offer are two engines,the 3.0L V6,and the 4.4L V8 which puts out stump-pulling 282 HP.
When a German hears "truck"(lastwagen) he thinks of a slow,Spartan beast of burden.So it's no surprise that BMW emphatically asserts it's new X5 is nicht lastwagen:not a truck.
The X5 is decidedly car like in design and demeanour,and it lacks key attribute that distinguishes SUV's from a tall station wagons:the ability to go truly off road,not just off the pavement.Whatever5 class you put it in,the X5 is handsome,quick,great performing,roomy,and certainly as all BMW's ,technology-laden.
It offers a lot of SUV like features such as tall seating positions,enough space in the back for a couple of Labrador retrievers,and the capability to tow three tons of toys.Coupled with it are non existence of typical SUV negative characters such as rough ride,chassis flex,dicey pavement handling,and massive stopping distances.
The new X5 incorporates many features from the 5 series.The x5's front and rear sub-frames are adaptations of those on the 5 and 7 series.The McPherson-strut front and multilink rear suspensions are closely related to its more expensive members of the family.The X5 employs rear air springs with an automatic levelling system to help it bear its 555.8 kg maximum payload.The only transmission available is a five-speed automatic that allows manual control.The X5's all-wheel-drive system diverts power from the back of the transmission through a chain drive,and splits the torque roughly one-third front and two-thirds rear.With its differentials all open,the X5 employs computer-controlled individual brake calliper applications,combined with digital throttle lifts,to limit wheelspin and enhance low-traction acceleration.Giant disc brakes tackle the multiple duties of deacceleration,computer directed assistance and standing in for limited slip differentials and low-range gearing.
Both on and off road driving reveals that the X5 is more of a sporty vehicle than a true off-roader.The not so friendly DSC-X,the driver would most probably battle for control against the vehicle's computer.The X5's rack-and-pinion steering offers firm,communicative,confidence inspiring feel.On the highway the X5 seems as solid and secure as anything this side of a Mercedes S-Class.
Included in the X5's list of available high-tech features are an infra-red-reflecting windshield,a sonar-like parking distance monitor,GPS-based navigation system,tyre-pressure monitors,voice control for mobile phone system,rain sensing automatic windshield wipers and the above mentioned stability and traction control systems.
Front headroom comfortably tops that of a Merc E class.It's like driving a 540i but with a better field of vision.All only ensuring a strong sense of security.Front,head,and side airbags for front seat passengers are standard while side airbags for rear seat passengers are optional ,only emphasising the fact that the X5 recieved the highest available score for company-conducted crash tests.
The only major question is whether the BMW X5 is worth its sticker price of around $44,000.Guess ill have to leave that for you to decide.But,the driving pleasure experienced in a marque of true german engineering is unequalled by any of its japanese competitor machines.
