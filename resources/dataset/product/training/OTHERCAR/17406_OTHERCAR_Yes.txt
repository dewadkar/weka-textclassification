            I bought this used in 2001 to replace my aging 1995 BMW 325i.  Needless to say they handle quite differently.  I am very impressed with they Toyota's all around quality.  So far the only maintenance I have had to do so far is changing the oil.  It handles more like a car than a truck, but it's size is noticeable on corners.  The stock stereo leaves a lot to be desired, but I am one who prefers this because I would rather not pay for "premium sound" which I will inevitably replace with truly high quality equipment.
The engine performs well, but doesn't have a ton of power when considering how much gas I use.  They new models now offer a V8, which was not available then.  It is, however able to handle towing-I have towed jetskis, a box trailer, and a boat.
My 4Runner does not have the stock tires, so I could not comment on the standard off road abilities, however mine does very well on snow and the small amount of trail driving that I have done.
I am a little disappointed in the selection of accessories available for this car.  There is much more available for the American SUV's, but that is a quality trade-off that I am not willing to make.
The exterior of the 4Runner is well styled and earns plenty of positive comments, especially from females, which is always a plus.  The interior is fairly plain, but adequate.  The dash guages are essentially the same ones that Toyota was using in 1990, but give you the information that you need.
I suggest buying cloth seats and having custom leather done, but I tend to prefer customization over prefabrication.
I plan on getting a medium dog in the next few months and think that this would make an excellent car for pets.
