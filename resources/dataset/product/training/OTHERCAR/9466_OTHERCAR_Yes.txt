            I come from a long line of GM truck owners, so you can imagine my initial response when my husband insisted on buying a new Dodge.  I just couldn't see myself owning any truck that wasn't a GM make.  But my husband has been a Dodge man for years so I had to consider buying one.  Once I saw the new body style of the 1994 Dodge Ram, I began to take a second look.  

At a time when all the other manufacturers seemed to be striving to look the same, Dodge went out on a limb and came up with a new look.  I fell in love with it immediately.  The new design of the exterior was the hook that got me to check out the more important features of the truck.

The first thing that really stood out is that Dodge is the only truck on the market that still has an actual axle in the front.  All other makes have gone to independent front suspension, which most people like.  But not my husband, he wanted a real axle.  This does make for a slightly stiffer ride, but you don't buy a four wheel drive for the smooth ride anyway.

My husband and I are both fairly tall, so interior design is important to us.  We found that the Dodge had the most leg room and the best set-up of controls overall.  I like the oversize controls on the radio and cruise control.  I also like the placement of the cruise controls on the steering wheel.  I, personally, don't like the all-in-one lever that most other makes use.

After test driving several trucks in three different states, we finally found the best deal and ordered our truck.  We ordered our four wheel drive in December 1993 and pick it up in March 1994.  We ordered our truck with power everything except the transmission.  We opted for the   5-speed manual tranny.  

This has caused us the only trouble that we have had with the truck.  The transmission went out at about 50,000 miles.  Luckily, it didn't actually quit on the side of the road and it was still under warranty.  We had opted for the 70,000 mile powertrain warranty.  We took the truck to the nearest Dodge dealer and in a couple of days, we had a brand new transmission.  We were told that our model year had some powertrain problems and that Dodge was replacing any that came in for repair rather than try to repair it.

The only other drawback to our truck is that it's not an extended cab.  Unfortunately, Dodge didn't offer an extended cab in the 1994 model and my husband refused to wait a year to see if they would offer one in 1995.  He had to have the first model year of the new truck.  Which only means we will end up buying a second Dodge in the future.

We haven't had anymore problems with our truck.  We now have almost 110,000 miles on it and we plan to put another 110,000 on it in the years to come.<br><br>
