            Before I'd like to state that I'm not entirely objective on this one. I've always wanted a Mercedes, especially since I was able to drive a friend's S-Class (W116) in the 80s. I will give objectivity a try, though.

The car I'm talking about is a 1996 E320 (W210) with the 3.2L I6 engine (140.995). It's 'black-opal' (black/blue/green depending on the light) in color and has most options available for that particular model year.
It was purchased pre-owned at a local dealership in Marysville Ohio in the spring of 2000, after it spend most of its live in Honda's research department and in a short private lease. It had 22.5K miles on the clock when purchased.

<b> Exterior </b>
The styling is somewhat conservative but appealing. I very much like the four distinct headlights. I love the color, even though I'm not quite sure how to describe it.

<b> Interior </b>
The interior is plush and roomy, but minimalistic in the typical German way. The climate control is cryptic by American standards. Other than the flimsy cupholders, I couldn't design it any better.
It is interesting to see that Mercedes essentially has maintained the same dashboard/instrument layout over the last twenty years. The interior is conservative in a good sense. The seats are somewhat hard, but surprisingly comfortable. They don't offer much support as side bolsters are concerned, but I have yet to find a person of any size that does not like them

<b>Powertrain</b>
The inline six is very quiet and more than adequate for the vehicle. The transmission does a good job, never hunting for gears or releasing too early. Both engine and transmission are very unobtrusive, as they should be in a luxury vehicle.

<b>Ride quality and handling</b>
I should be talking about 'glide quality'. It has the typical soft suspension feel of a Mercedes and the vehicle shows body roll if driven hard. But I have yet to find the car's limits, and the handling remains neutral at all times, giving the driver a rather nice secure feeling.

<b>Quality</b>
I've only had a minor problem with the final drive leaking transmission fluid. This incident happened right after I purchased this vehicle, and I contribute it to the vehicle not being driven for a long time.
The quality has been impeccable in every other way. There is no squeak or loose interior panel even after five years.

<b> Service and Maintenance Cost </b>
Service, as expected, is expensive. The major service will set you back $600 or more. However, the car is relatively easy to work on if you can find maintenance information. Changing the oil is a breeze. After a year I have yet to incur any repair costs other than the initial problem described above.

<b> Conclusion </b>
If you can get over the price and certain image issues (I seem to be the only non-retiree in my area driving one. It is also a common taxi cab in Europe.), you get a reliable and very comfortable luxury sedan when buying the E-Class. If you like the typical Mercedes sedan of the past, this is probably a good choice.
