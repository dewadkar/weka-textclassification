            I own seven cars and this is the one I use the most. This car is ultra refined in it's sounds. This car has Porshe handling, and the suspension is perfect. The interior has a lot of quality, the dashboard the leather on the doors and the pockets on the doors. I love that carbon fiber that is on the dash board. The leather is so smooth and soft. The car is tight as you turn a corner, is the perfect convertable as I mentioned in my title. There are just no negatives of a convertable. This convertable is an all season convertable. The flexible service system is awesome change the oil every 15,000-20,000 miles. The mileage on my car is 65,000 miles never been to the shop but for five oil changes.
