            I bought my new Caravan in 1997. It has been very reliable, in fact I have not had any mechanical problems with it at all. While it was a great van for us in the beginning we have 4 children and the leg room in the back seat of the standard Caravan is a little sparse and we could use a little more cargo space. We plan to fix this minor problem by trading into the Grand caravan,which I would suggest for any family that needs both back seats. 

As far as driving the van taking into consideration visibility, driver comfort and controls I think the Caravan is the best of the many that I test drove. The only drawback that I do not like is the position of the indicator lights, it seems that your hands block the most important of those (the bright and indicator lamps). But all thing considered this is a small price to pay for the well laid out instrument panel.

One thing to consider is that the bench seats are pretty heavy and I prefer to have two people to remove the seats. If I was going to have to take them out very often I would consider getting the bucket seats in the center row as they are light and easy to remove.<br><br>
