            I bought the SLK back in the summer of 98 and still gives me thrills every time I drive the car. Although this car is a four cylinder the supercharger does its jobs to give the car outstanding acceleration. I am glad that there is a traction control system that is standard in this car because I am often cautioned by the blinking hazard light that the system is in action. Usually this happens when I accelerate quickly while turning the vehicle.  With this feature I have never spun the tires. If you desire to do so you can always deactivate this function and burn all the rubber all you want.
This car is definitely an attractive car. Although there are other car that are comparable is this price range, if luxury/sports car look is what you are looking for this is it. There is no other cars in this category or if fact the car industry (at this time) that offers a retractable hardtop.  This not only gives the SLK a sleek look of a coupe with the top up, it gives it the flashiness of a convertible also. The SLK offers all this in a package that is luxurious. 
The interior of the car is definitely Mercedes. With the soft touch of leather and the nice white gauges in the instrument cluster, this car blends the current styles of Mercedes along with a retro look of the past. The button and switches for all the normal A/C and radio controls are strategically placed in all the right places. The carbon fiber-look on the dash is also a nice touch.
Then there is the real question. Should you choose the manual transmission or the automatic. My decision was rather simple since at the time of my purchase a manual transmission was not offered. What would I chose if I had a choice you ask? Well that all depends on the reason why you are purchasing this car vehicle. Like I have previously mentioned this car combines luxury and sportiness.  Which do you prefer to weigh more heavily on? 
But realistically, a manual transmission is not going make you go outstandingly faster while it will let you control the car more and possible take a few pounds off the car. However, some people do not see cars as being sports cars without a manual transmission. Well if that the case I would tell you to go with the manual transmission. Personally, I would purchase the automatic if I had the choice. While I was eagerly anticipated the coming of the manual car before I made the purchase, after living with the automatic for over a year now I enjoy it a lot. Sports car fanatic who believe that manual transmission is a must is looking at the wrong car with the SLK.  The SLK works on a balance. It is not a true sports car.  Similarly it is not a true luxury car. In this balance, I feel that automatic is the better choice in completing the car.   <br><br>
