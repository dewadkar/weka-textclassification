            After painstakingly researching SUVs for 6 months, I decided on the Rodeo and haven't been disappointed.  First, I needed something I could fit into.  Xterra/Pathfinder?  No way.  Explorer?  Yes, but everyone and their brother has an explorer.  Cherokee?  Yes, but same owner frequency as explorer, plus $10,000 more.  So I hopped into a compeltely loaded 2000 Rodeo LSE and have never looked back.  Very spacious interior (even with sunroof..I am 6'3 and don't have clearance problems).  Ride is a little harsh, but I knew it was going to be.  V6 engine is great as well.  My only complaint is the CD/sound system (for the money, they could have thrown something a little more impressive in).  Other than that, I couldn't beat the value for the price.  I paid 29.5 for a loaded LSE (basically invoice), plus Isuzu offered the 2000 dollar rebate.  For 27.5, this is a hell of a ride. <br><br>
