            This was the first digital camera I bought (1997) - and it was cheap for a digicam then, a snip at GBP499 (USD750ish). Although I knew it wasn't a replacement for a 35mm, 1-hour processing shop and a scanner, I had hoped to use it to take photos for the web, or for just playing around with. The lack of zoom or flash, however, restrict it to brightly-lit indoor shots, or good-light outdoor shots. And since you can't zoom the lens, you're restricted in what you can snap anyway. The swivel-head is an interesting novelty, allowing you to examine your nostrils using the LCD viewfinder (which only updates about 3-4 times a second, which rules out action shots). Finally, the software is actually reasonably good (for its age), but you are restricted to serial comms (no flash cards, USB, etc.).

In all - only buy one if you're absolutely desperate for a digital camera, and you find one going for less than ï¿½25-50 ($35-75).<br><br>
