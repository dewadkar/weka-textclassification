At last it is available, an import car that rivals all others, not the common run of the mill vehicle on the road either.  The import cars from Japan and Korea have threatened the North American domestic market since the late seventies.  Honda and Toyota have become as influencial as the American big three and are as highly regarded.  But one of the problems with import cars are the scarcity of the vehiches.  Actually that is an oxymoron, there is no scarcity, everywhere you turn there is a Civic, Accord, Corolla and Camry.  Its getting to the point, where you know someone that drives one of these things.

Individuality is very important, the car you drive actually represents a part of you.  Now, if you are going to drive an import, then you might as well drive a car that stands out.  How many times have you seen a Honda Civic with rims and a skirt package, just to be unique.  Everyone driving an import vehicle is just so interested in driving something different. Why try, when you can do.

The Suburu Impreza WRX, is a car to be reckoned with.  It has 227 horsepower and has a 2 litre fuel displacement.  What that means is power, fuel consumption with speed and control.  Not to mention the car is All Wheel Drive, now that is a Suburu speciality.  That really is a great asset, there are not too many cars that have AWD.  Actually unless you are going to purchase a SUV, there is no way you can get an AWD on a Sedan. Unless of course you decide to purchase an M series from BMW, for80 grand.

Fully loaded for less than 30 grand, the Suburu Impreza WRX is a great deal.  When you actually get into the car and drive it, the feeling is one of 
euphoria.  You like you are playing a really good video game.  The controls 
are amazing and the standard features are one of the best deals currently 
offered by any car company.  It is impossible to drive the car without wanting to speed, its just that fast and powerful.  Also the great thing about it is, you will be the only one on the road with it.  But my favorite standard feature of the car is the steering wheel.  That's right, the car actually comes witha Momo steering wheel.  Now i have always wanted one of those, but never wanted to spend the money.  This car actually comes with one as a standard feature.  What a great addition.

With the general public fixed on the quality and tradition of Honda and Toyota.  But for one who wants to live life on the edge, try the Suburu Impreza WRX.  Give it a test drive and I promise you will not be disappointed.

I would recommend the car to anyone who loves to drive on the wild side.  This vehicle is a great deal; looks like it can beat anything on the road.  With the introduction of this car, Suburu has taken a giant leap into the domestic 
market.
