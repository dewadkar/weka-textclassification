            I purchased an Olympus C-3040 digital camera and have found this unit to be extremely satisfying!  The quality
of the photos are OUTSTANDING.  Contrary to what many say, I have found the camera is very easy to use. 
The first photo I shot out of the box (after I put the batteries in) was excellent.  I have shot many photos since
then.  It is also fun to use!  No more FILM!  

Being a former professional photographer who relied on medium format cameras, I like to think that I am some
what critical of image quality, color saturation, and exposure.  The color and contrast is great, even under
tungsten and florescent lighting.  Low light level shots with "film speed" set at 400 is very good.  You can also
override the lens aperture and shutter speed, as well as manual focus.  The macro works wonderful.

I am happy with how long the batteries last, as I got maybe 300 to 500 2148x1536 photos and who knows how
much time in the quick time movies with the original set of batteries that came with the camera.  I now use
Sanyo rechargeable MH batteries from Steve's Digital Camera reviews.  No need for the optional AC adapter
that the sales person insisted upon having.  

Down loading the photos are a snap as the camera is treated as a removable drive via a USB port and images
can be simply cut from the camera and pasted into a folder or CD-RW.  I purchased the 64 MB smart card, and
128 MB cards are now available for less than $150.  When printing the photos, I use a cheap-o $100 (new closeout)
(but good) Epson color 740 ink jet using color laser copier paper (24#) set at 760x760 dpi.  People are amazed
by the quality.  So am I!  

No more trips to the local specialty photo processor for me on most items.  I will just print them up at home!  If
you know how to program your VCR, then you will have no problem with this unit.  If you don't know how to
program that VCR, most likely you will have problems not only with understanding the FULL features of the
camera but you will have problems using a simple photo editing program as well, (I use Ulead Photo Impact 6,
excellent program!!) then stick with a simple cheap camera that's around one mega pixel.  

The camera could use a little more zoom but it's a very small package to begin with as it stands only about 3 or
4 inches high!  I recommend also purchasing the 64 or 128 MB smart card.  No need, in MY opinion, for the
AC adapter, just buy some NiMH rechargeable batteries and enjoy.  I now use the NiMH batteries all over the
house instead of alkalines.  This is my first digital camera.  I purchased it very thinking I would not be happy
with image quality and I thought nothing could replace film.  I was WRONG.  Film is on the way out, and I
thought I'd NEVER say this, and it's GREAT to be liberated from processing labs and negatives!  

It is difficult to say anything bad about the Olympus C-3040.  I highly recommend it!
