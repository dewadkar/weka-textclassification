            The MX2700 has replaced my office scanner for all but a few uses.  Instead of taking pictures &quot;the old fashioned way&quot; and then scanning them into documents I simply preview the pics in the camera and download what I need.  I also have had great results photographing other pics or objects that I used to scan. This camera is small enough to slip into most pockets and I found it more convenient than my other choice, a Sony, because the Fuji camera body size doesn't have to fit a floppy into it.  I do recommend using a floppy adapter instead of the cable and software provided with the camera as it is easier to preview pics on by simply inserting the media card into the floppy adapter and reading from the drive.  Haven't had any dislikes yet, just remember to erase unwanted frames as you go to create open space on the Smartmedia card, erase all and reformat otherwise the card may think there is no more space because of its frame counter.  I learned this the hard way as I was snapping away not realizing that each shot kept over writing the last.  Once I erased the full card the problem was resolved.  Check all around for pricing, I paid $699 but have seen it on the net for as low as $521, though always confirm shipping etc.  Nice little camera, good pics.<br><br>
