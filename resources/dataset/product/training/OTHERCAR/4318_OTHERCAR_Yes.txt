            &lt;b.My wife and I bought this car new in 1994. We were taken with it's good looks and roomy interior. We chose the LE because it came that year without airbags. My wife is small and the airbags were dangerous to her. The sales people at Stampede Toyota in Calgary Alberta were very helpful in setting us up with the car of our choice.
We wanted a car with little extra electrical devices and economy was the key. this car has given us  no trouble with it at all in the 6 years we have driven it.
It is not a seasonal car because it runs  very well summer or winter , on the prairies or on the west coast. It has passed all The B.C. air quality testing with better than average readings. It is very comfortable on long drives and you have to watch your speed because it can accelerate above 110 km quite rapidly. 

Our Corolla is a LE having this option we saved money and don't regret the choice. WE had a problem at first the car never got it's rated miles per gallon, but  when a maintenance check revealed a stuck thermostat the dealer rectified it and the mileage improved by 10%.
 I recommend this car for any family, up to five. It has a very spacious trunk , I hate the spare mini tire because if we had a full size tire we could rotate it into  use when we rotate our tires. 

 It is worth following the maintenance program and having the extended warranty. the dealer set up each buyer with a shop tour and 3 hour course on &quot; getting to know your Corolla&quot; with about 12 other customers. This extra care in letting you know what to do for yourself was appreciated.

 The Michelin  tires  came as standard equipment and are great. I drove a similar Toyota with the other choice and the car didn't even fell the same on the road. Try this car out, new or used  i think you will like them.<br><br>
