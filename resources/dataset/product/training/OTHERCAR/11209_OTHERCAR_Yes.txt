            We don't have children. My husband was primarily looking for a vehicle that he could haul stuff around in occasionally. He initially checked out pickup trucks, but I didn't want one because their abilities to transport multiple passengers (comfortably) were more limited. We had previously owned a Dodge Caravan, which he liked, but it was a stripped down model and had no luxuries whatsoever. We finally agreed to purchase another van and the Mercury had more options for the price. This particular model is a lot more luxurious with a plush interior and a lot more choices were offered with the seating arrangements. It's a little bulky for me to drive but my husband loves it.<br><br>
