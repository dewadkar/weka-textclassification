            I found this Mazda truck to be a very dependable vehicle. The truck handles beautifully, always starts.. even in the dead of winter, is easy to maintain and is very cost-efficient. I find that my Mazda also has great gas mileage.. and is very comfortable both in the country and on busy city streets. I would recommend this vehicle for people who would like the versatility of a truck, without the obvious hassles of a full size pick-up. Even without power steering, I find the Mazda easy to maneuver.. which is great for both a leisurely drive and utilitarian purposes. <br><br>
