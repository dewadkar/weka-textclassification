            Not being &quot;minivan material&quot;, this vehicle had a lot to prove before I would give it a thumbs up. After test driving many in the minivan category, the Grand Caravan was my choice.  This is a solid, well built vehicle.  The Grand Caravan has not only form, but function.  In the past, I had driven minivans that drove like lumbering buses.  You felt every bump in the road and every change in wind direction.  Needless to say, the Grand Caravan's turning radius is excellent, handles well in curves. The dual doors are a handy feature, no longer do you have to think about which side is most convenient for loading or unloading. Parking the older vans was better left to those who could do so blindfolded.  Not the case with the Grand Caravan.  Grand Caravan offers good visibility in all driving conditions and does not hamper one's ability to parallel park. The Grand Caravan maneuvers like a sports car.  The interior design is well thought out and also well made.  After sitting in many of the competition's offerings, all of the seating in the Grand Caravan far outclassed the rest.  Comfortable and stable.  Nothing cheap about the way this seat was made.  I can't say the same for others.  The overhead console, some would say is unnecessary, I beg to differ.  I LIKE knowing how many miles to the gallon I'm getting at the push of a button, I like knowing I have x miles to go before running out of gas.  The trip odometer and compass are also very handy on trips. The instrument panel is clear and uncluttered for ease of use.  The front and back controls for air/heat are a definite plus.  Not only am I comfortable, my family is too.  The only cautions that I would give on this vehicle are that it tends to hydroplane in more than a half inch of water, it has the same problem all vans have with high winds.  The last bit of caution may be limited to certain models, I can only speak from experience.  Dodge seems to have a bit of a problem with transmissions.  I have trouble getting the gear shift to lock in and most recently experienced a transmission slip while driving.  It didn't pop out, it just slipped.  Suddenly my engine was gunning and I was going nowhere. Overall, pending Dodge's actions on my transmission, I would buy this vehicle again. <br><br>
