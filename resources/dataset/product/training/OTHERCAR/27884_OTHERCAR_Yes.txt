            Ahh the M3, referred amongst my friends as 'The Beast'. This evil car can rack up serious speeding tickets if your not careful. And it rains a little too often here, so I have the coupe.

I looked at a LOT of cars before buying my M3: Audi S4, Lexus GS400 and SC400, Mazda RX7, Honda Prelude, Corvette and many, many others. To be fair, the Audi and Lexus sedans have more updated styling and amenities over the BMW (the new M3 appears sometime in 2000, possibly with a V8). The GS400 was a huge disappointment and felt like driving a semi-fast Camry or Accord. The S4 is a very nice car, but the shifter, the handling, and the low range acceleration just didn't impress. The RX7 was eventually thrown out when I decided 4 seats was a requirement. The Prelude is a very nice car, but just wasn't in the same league. Honda needs to improve the interior build quality and the cars acceleration if it wants to charge $30k for the Prelude. My boss has a new Vette, and it practically lives in the shop, and then there's that seat problem.

This car has perfect: Handling, Brakes, Shifter, Trans., Steering, Pedal Control, Acceleration... 

This car has imperfect: Mirrors (too small, sort of), insurance rates, ticket probability.

As Montulli also suggested, beef up the suspension a bit as the stock can rattle loose (esp. on our pothole infested Louisiana roads). I also suggest the performance upgrade chip, which will let you get tickets going over the stock's 140 MPH governed limit.

Finally, if you can afford the M3 I wholeheartedly suggest it. If you can't, don't worry, its just a car, there's lots of other great ones out there for much less. And for those that complain it�s not race-worthy: Umm, it�s not a racecar. The M3 is a real car that I can drive every day.. Quickly.. with 3 people in tow.. and luggage..

Also: If you're looking for a used M3 (like I decided to) check for a few things. 1) Gearbox - It seems many people who buy these are not familiar with manual transmissions and grind the trans. into submission. 2) Check the front end as it can quickly get out of alignment. 3) The tires will only get about 15,000 miles. And they�re not cheap either.
