            I bought my 1999 Mercury Sable after my mother and sister both bought one. Each time I rode in their Sables I thought they were comfortable and smooth on the road.

I wanted something bigger than my previous car after I had my second child. The Mercury Sable is extremely roomy both in the passenger area and the luggage area.

I love this vehicle. I love the fact that I don't feel like I am sitting on top of other passengers in my vehicle, that my children have lots of room and aren't in each others faces, that I can take all the luggage I need without having to worry that when I come home I wont be able to get extras in the trunk. I have not found anything that I hate about this vehicle. It is exactly what I wanted and I knew it before I test drove any other vehicles.

If you have a compact car and are looking for something bigger, this is the car to buy! If you love to travel and need lots of room when you go on the road, this is the car to buy! You won't feel like you bought something you didn't want after going home from the car lot when you choose this vehicle as your next car.<br><br>
