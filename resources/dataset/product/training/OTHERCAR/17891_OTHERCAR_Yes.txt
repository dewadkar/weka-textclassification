            Acura�s RL is probably the best car that people DON�T buy.  Like all other Acura�s the RL is a very conservatively styled sedan with great luxury appointments, and it�s offered at a relatively cheap price� and therein lays Acura�s problems.  Well, consider Acura�s problem to be your windfall, because the RL is a great car.  It offers all the refinement of the big boys: the MB-320, BMW 528, Lexus GS300, without the high sticker price.  Unfortunately, the lower price means that it has less snob appeal and won�t serve as a status symbol, and consequently, you�ll see many people ante up for one of the above-mentioned cars.

The first reason to buy an Acura is that you are getting a large car for the money.  The car has tons of room, so fitting 5 adults will be no problem.  A remarkably large cabin ensures that even tall people won�t feel cramped.  Additionally, the trunk is large enough that you can easily fit all 5 people�s luggage if you take them anywhere.  I think that the Acura definitely has overall more space than the better-named cars, for example, look at how small a MB-E320 trunk is if you don�t believe me.

Another reason to buy an Acura is that while it is costs about $10K, the luxury features are on par with the name brand cars.  You�ll find all the usual features, heated seats, memory seats, auto-rearview mirror, xenon lights, sunroof, etc� standard on this car, yet you�ll have to get different luxury packages to get them on one of the other cars.  The style of this car can also be described as tasteful.  The plastics look to be good quality and the wood is well placed, although sparse in comparison to the E320 and 528.  They layout is simple and elegant with no bells or whistles� typical Japanese.  One thing that the Acura is missing is dual-climate control� which is pretty much standard on the other cars.

The drive of the Acura is great and easily on par with the cars mentioned above.  It�s smooth and incredibly quiet.  It handles well and body roll is minimal.  The car definitely feels solid when you are driving and even when you close the door, so you�ll never feel like the wind will blow you off the road.  The transmission is smooth and driving this car is extremely easy.  In fact, some people may argue that the steering doesn�t communicate enough information about the road.  Additionally, one big advantage this car has is that it�s front wheel drive, making it a great car all year round.  One complaint with this car is that the gas mileage is not great.  Don�t look for more than 20 MPG city and highway� which is probably on the lower end of the scale.  (I�ve seen the E-320 give around 30 highway.)

Given all those accolades, why would someone want to pay more for one of these other cars?  Well, the most obvious reason is that the Acura simply does not have the same name behind it as these other cars do.  People seem to consider BMW, Lexus, and MB to have better names.  Another problem is that you can choose to get the same style of car with a V-8 engine.  This upgrade is sorely missing in Acura�s line-up.  Also, some people may prefer the outright sportiness of the Lexus or the ever-more-slightly distinguished styling of the BMW and MB E-series.  Additionally, German engineering tend to be a better balance of communicating road feel and keeping the car easy to drive.  Lastly, while you won�t need to do make any additional service stops with any of these cars, you�ll probably get higher quality of service from the other dealers.  

All in all, you can�t go wrong with the Acura RL.  It represents a great value combining space, luxury, and style that will last for years to come.  It�s missing just a few of the amenities that these other cars possess.  However, �value� isn�t necessarily the most sought after adjective for which Acura was looking.  Overall, the greatest difference in everyday driving will be the status, and if you can live with that� you will be able to save $10K and be very happy with an Acura RL.
