            I had been coveting a RAV4, but it was priced too high.  The Kia Sportage had a reputation as a having a high proportion of lemons.  I liked the Vitara the first time I saw it, which was on the web.  I bought mine early, and I'm just now beginning to see others on the road.  I like the way it drives.  The one problem is that, as others have mentioned, acceleration is poor &amp; the power-assist button doesn't really help a lot.  As far as problems go, I had the A/C hose disconnect (went to the dealer in a big panic); also, once I ran out of gas before it looked like I was that close to empty.  There was some crash data on the mini-SUV's which indicated that this car does about as well as any in this category.  The other disadvantage is that dealers are few &amp; far between.   I feel comfortable when I'm driving, and my front-seat passengers all seem settle in well, with the seat semi-reclined.  The back seat is a little tight, but I rarely have more than one other person in the car.  Ive never even adjusted the steering column, because the car felt good to me on my first test drive.  I like this car very much!<br><br>
