            When it was time to trade the "old Silhouette ('93 model) in," I test drove an '01 Silhouette. It had all the "bells and whistles" I was used to, plus many more. I was totally infatuated - not crazy about the leather seats, but figured I could get used to that - after all, there WAS a seat warmer!

Well, I was out test-driving on the city streets, checked my rearview mirror, signaled that I wanted to change lanes, looked out the passenger side windows, and proceeded into my lane change. Suddenly I heard a horn blaring at me and noticed that I had changed lanes right in front of a little sports car! Scared me to death! Major blind spot! I was shaking like a leaf, thinking not only could I have totaled this brand new mini-van I was test driving!, but I could have killed, or seriously injured, someone!

When I returned to the dealership and mentioned the major blind spot to the salesman, his "solution" was to fold the seats down while I am driving! NOT an option, since I have a three year-old who would be in a car seat in one of those seats obstructing my view! And, because the van we were test driving had the 6 captain's chairs, my precious cargo (my daughter) would have been in an outside seat, rather than being able to strap her car seat into the middle seat.

I was truly disappointed, because I had loved our other Silhouette (until it began costing us so much in repairs - after the warranty was out); and, like I said, I was very much infatuated with all the "bells and whistles" on the new van, and I loved the idea of more spaciousness this van seemed to offer over our older model. But, the salesman's "solution" was not acceptable, and I'm not going to knowingly drive something that has a major blind spot where I could kill or seriously injure someone - my loved ones, or someone else's loved ones.

I really love the car we did purchase, but am sad the Silhouette did not work out!
