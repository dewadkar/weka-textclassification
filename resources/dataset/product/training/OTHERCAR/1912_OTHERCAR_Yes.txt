            I just got back from another business trip where Avis rented me a <b>Nissan Maxima LX</b> this time.  This 2000 model had 780 miles on it and was in fantastic shape.  I drove it a total of 60 miles, so my epinion is just about comfort, pick up, looks and handling -- not about reliability.

<b>The good:</b>

-- Wonderful pick up.  It had more power than I anticipated, making for a jerky ride at first.  I'd rather a jerky powerful ride instead of a smooth weak one.  It only took me a few seconds to adapt to this power.

-- The dashboard is well-suited for short drivers.  Though I'm not short, I can appreciate this feature.  The dashboard doesn't come above the top of the steering wheel.  It slopes up gradually at modern angles.

-- The middle console is well-designed.  It's one of those that lifts up to reveal storage space.  The bottom level is deep and wide -- plenty of room for CDs, tapes, maps, etc.  Then there is a middle level that is lifted separately so that you can store flat items there without having them fall out when you lift the center to get to the bottom.  And to top it all off, the very top of the console raises and lowers to accommodate elbow levels. Really a neat piece of engineering.

-- The seats are very roomy.  The driver's seat goes back very far for long legs.  It's not very wide though.

-- The gauges are very pleasant to look at.  Nothing fancy to distract from the road.  Classy.

-- Good gas mileage.  On the highway, I got in the high 20s per gallon.

<b>The bad</b>

-- The body is very average.  It looks like every other mid-sized car on the market.  Very egg-like.

-- Like I said above, the driver's seat is a little skinny.  Not much room to spread your knees.  The automatic shifter and emergency brake seem to invade the driver's space.

--------------------------------

Overall, I was very impressed with this car.  If I'm ever in the market for a mid-sized car, this will be on the top of my list.
