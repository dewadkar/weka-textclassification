            One of the best things about Digital cameras is that you don't have to waste film.  If you don't like the shot just simply delete it.  The PDR-M1 offers excellent picture quality for it's price.  It uses smart media as storage and you can upgrade the memory if you need more.  It has a LCD screen on the back so you can view the picture after the shot or you can use it as a view finder if you don't want to look through the tiny hole.

The only draw back with this camera is that it is battery hungry.  I thought &quot;great, no more film and developing cost!&quot;. What I didn't know is that I'll be buying batteries left and right to feed it!  One brand new set of Alkalines will only get you about 30 pictures if you're lucky.  You almost have to have an extra set of batteries on you when you take this or any digital camera out.  

This camera is slow.  There is a slight delay when you depress the &quot;shutter&quot; button. The object can not move at all.  If you were taking a picture of a moving car it would be down the block before it snaps it's picture!  Also the download time is very slow as well.  If you're on high resolution it feels like eternity before it downloads to your computer.

This camera is good for both pc and Mac formats. Software is included with the package.  

Overall it's a pretty good bang for the buck.  Pictures come out excellent. you can even do close up macro shots which is a plus!  Very simple to use. Good color too.<br><br>
