            It was the warranty that sold me on the car but, knock on wood, I haven't had to actually <i>use</i> the warranty yet! 

It turns out that the car is fabulous in its own right.What I didn't like was my less-than-successful haggling with the dealer who played some funny tricks with the numbers.

In retrospect, I really would have liked the sunroof and a CD player which were options. But enough complaining, because the car has been so much better than I could have imagined. The stock features are awesome -- a perfectly decent AM/FM Cassette, air conditioning, power windows/locks -- the ride is smooth, quiet (better with windows closed -- but that's true with most newer cars) and comfortable (I'm talking bedroom comfortable). The engine is really responsive (most HP in its class), especially with the 5-speed manual transmission (small drawback: the throw into 5th gear could be shorter). Handling's superb with a sporty 4-wheel-independent suspension. Gas mileage's great. Headroom is fine for my 5'4" frame...my 6'2" teenage son pushes the front passenger seat all the way back and down and he's in heaven. Sometimes he has to sit in the back for extended rides, and is ok with it, as were  three "comfortably-sized" gals who rode 100 miles sharing the back seat. The one complaint that they had was the air conditioning, which doesn't really kick, wasn't very effective in the back. Not really a problem for me since I don't like being chilled out anyway, but this could be for many people.

The console is only big enough for a couple of tapes and is situated too far back for a person of my height to use as an armrest, although a taller person could. Oh yeah, and the cupholders aren't big enough for jumbo drinks...and there could be more of them.

I like that the engine compartment isn't wall-to-wall spaghetti which means that later on, when the warranty's expired, I'll be able to work on the car myself (there was so much stuff in my 1987 Honda Accord that it cost me $500 just to change a water pump). Not that I anticipate any problems. I've had the car for 15 months and the only thing I needed to have fixed was the little hooks that hold the floormats in place broke and needed to be replaced. 

I understand the newer models have side airbags and some other nifty features. However, I really like the styling on my 2000. I think I'll keep it, though I'd definitely consider one of the other Hyundai models.
