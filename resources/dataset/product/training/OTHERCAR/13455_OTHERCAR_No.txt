              The Mercury Topaz is a 2 door or 4 door family car.  The car also come in GS. The Mercury Topaz is a very poorly built car by ford. First of all, the Mercury has lots of suspension problems from what I have read in consumer reports and personally use to own one of these vechiles.  I have had problems with the inner tie rods and outer tie rods. I had an axle to break on me one time. Also the Topaz has Headlight problems. If your headlights are &quot;glossed&quot; or filmed then you as the consumer would have to go out and spend 200 dollars to repair this item.
  Also the Topaz has power window failure and loose windows occur very easily.  The alternator is another major problem that most people and I have had problems with too. The charging system also known as the alternator goes out very seldom and has to be replaced frequently.  The only problems I have not heard out of any consumer mouth is the motor is excellent and no problems with that but everything else is a major cost to repair.  In my personal opinion if you are looking to purchase this vehicle I would highly not recommend it.  I am a auto repair technician and I see these cars come in and out of my shop every day so please be wary. Thanks.<br><br>
