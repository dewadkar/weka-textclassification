            We own a Fuji Advantix camera and have been very pleased with it, so when a Fuji digital appeared on QVC for $300, we bought it. It has not disappointed us. Pictures have good resolution. The only negative is pictures taken indoors have a slight brownish or reddish cast, similar to using outdoor film indoors. This could be because the flash is weak, but I expect as more experience is gained, a solution will be found. The camera is very compact, but in spite of the small size, it's easy to hold and operate. As with our other Fuji, everything works as advertised. Ours came with a coupon for a free floppy disk adapter; I'd definitely recommend getting it. It is slow to transfer a million+ pixels over a serial link.<br><br>
