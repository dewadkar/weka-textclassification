            The Lexus GS300 is a great car. I love it I have been driving it for a long time now.  The CD player is awesome and so is the air conditioning, steering, braking, and of course its looks. This is a great car and I would go out and get one if you are just starting to drive. The looks are great the transmission it is just overall outstanding. So you should mark my words and find out what Lexus is. The trunk is large enough to put your baggage and the nice leather seats are so comfortable that you feel like you in heaven. I recommend this car to anyone who loves a comfortable car. <br><br>
