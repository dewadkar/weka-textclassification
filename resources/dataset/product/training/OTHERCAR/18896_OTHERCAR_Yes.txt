            This Review is for a '93 Grand Cherokee Limited w/5.2 V-8.

I purchased my Jeep used with 220 000 K (137500 miles) on it. Yes, that's a lot of miles!

So far I have been pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the vehicle. There isn't one squeak or rattle to be heard, even when hitting a bump or pothole.
The engine remains surprisingly strong, even with all the miles on it. The transmission <b>is</b> starting to fade a little, and will need a re-build in a year or so.(not bad for 150 000 miles! )

The Fuel economy is rather poor.... a big drawback. Although I haven't done the math, it definitely eats the gas while city driving... especially if you're a "lead-foot".
The Hiway economy is actually pretty good. You can only expect so much from a ten year old V-8, and a vehicle this heavy.

The front suspension "shimmies" when turning sharply into a parking stall or the like. It's most likely tie-rod ends and the steering stabalizer. In any rate, it won't be too expensive to fix. This seems to be a common problem with some of the older Cherokees.

While the suspension does have a solid feel, there is some noticeable body roll when cornering. Again, this has to be expected from a solid axle, spring over shock design. If you intend to take this S.U.V. off-road... you will be amazed. It has great traction and a stable, predictable feel.

The paint on the roof is peeling a little, which is a recognized problem with some '93 models. In any case, it's not in plain view, and is very minor.

The interior of the vehicle is outstanding! The leather seats are the most comfortable I have been in. The leather has stood the test of time and has no cracks or splits. All the controls and switches work flawlessly. 

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the Gr.Cherokee. I paid $4000.00 (U.S.) for it, and is a solid deal.
