            I recently completed a business trip to the United States and had the luck to be given an Mitsubishi Montero Limited as my personal rental vehicle for the week!  This was the most enjoyable ride that I have had out of all of the rentals I have used during my career!

I am not a "big" vehicle kind of guy.  I personally prefer the smaller, sportier vehicles when given the chance but this trip I said why not!  I was in New Mexico and the terrain was perfect.

I had the Montero Limited. From the book that was in the dash this vehicle had the works.  More so than any other rental I had driven up to this point.  The power available to me came from a V-6 engine.  This thing had some "GO" power.  Moderate hills did not have a chance.  It almost felt like I was riding in a hummer(HUMMV)

The Limited has a five speed Sportronic sequential shift automatic transmission. You can shift up or down with a nudge on the shift lever. It came in handy when I needed to lose speed quick without tapping on my brakes and highlighting myself. 

Someone had already trashed the transmission on the vehicle even though it had around 12,000 miles on it.  It may have had something to do with the transmission "learning" how the previous renters drove. There was some hesitation for it to shift automatically between the 1,2 and 3rd gears.  Once into third gear the vehicle was fine.  Until then the RPM would peg around 5000 rpm before it would shift during the normal automatic mode.  

The Montero has excellent handling charecteristics!  I expected the thing to turn like a pig and the first few high speed turns I was waiting for the rocking feeling as if the vehicle was going to tip but it never did.  The steering was very tight, turned well and the ride was very smooth.  Road noise was negligible when the vehicle was closed up.  

I imagine the Four wheel disc brakes lent nicely to it's stop on a dime ability coupled with the ABS.  I was hoping for a good rain to be able to put a real test on the ABS but no such luck.

The Limited had more than it's fair share of features:

*Heated leather seats
*Front and rear variable speed wipers
*Automatic seat controls
*Power windows and locks
*Lighted vanity mirrors
*Extended glare shield
*Intuitive control design
*CD player, AM/FM stereo (I had this thing cranked all the way and there was no compromise of the sound)
*Powerful AC
*Airbags driver and passenger
*Door open display
*Oversize Sun roof 

There were certainly many more but I cannot remember them all.  The instrument display in the Montero Limited has analog gauges but it is also backed up by a digital display which includes air temperature, compass, miles to empty, and date/time. It appeared to have other features on the digital display but I did not spend the time to learn them all.

I received many complements for the vehicles stylish features and design.  The other company "men" were bombarding me with questions which invariably led to them getting a chance to go for a quick spin.  It was easier to let them see than just talk about it.  Fair bet a few will be Montero owners before the year is out!

If I ever decide to trade in my sporty cars for an SUV then the Mitsubishi has my vote.
