            I bought a 1998 Saturn SL2 last year. I had heard good things about the way that Saturn does business and the quality of their products, so we decided to give them a try. 

The first thing we noticed was that this truly is a compact car. While it appears to be about the same size as our Toyota Corolla, there is quite a bit less room in the Saturn than in the Toyota. It is very uncomfortable to drive and also to ride in as a passenger.

Next is safety. Earlier in the year, we were rear-ended at about 10 MPH. Both of the front seats collapsed backwards and laid flat to the back upon impact. This concerned us greatly, as our 1 year old daughter was in a car seat in the backseat. Saturn's response to this was that it is a safety feature for the people in the front seats.  I think they need to give some thought to people in the back seats, too.

The SL2 drives ok, but it has a terrible turning radius.


Do I like anything about this car? I must say that the &quot;no-haggle&quot; policy of the Saturn dealerships made the actual process of purchasing a car less stressful. Also, the plastic body panels have saved several dings in parking lots.

Overall, I would not buy another Saturn.<br><br>
