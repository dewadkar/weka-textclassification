            So I was getting a bit tired of my 1996 Mustang GT and got myself looking into what I might buy to replace it.  I knew I wanted something sporty, but at the same time I had a moderately tight budget of about $20,000 I was trying to stick under.

I looked at the Mustangs, but a GT (the LX just wasn't enough power for my tastes) was out of my price range, especially considering that even with the slick-looking new body the interior of the car was pretty much the same as it had been for the last 10 years (yawn).  On to other things...

Enter the Tiburon.  At first, I hadn't seriously considered this an option.  Pre-2003, they didn't come with anything larger than a baby 4 cyl. engine, and the lines of the car looked more like a partially used bar of soap than a sports car.  However, after looking at the lines of the new one and checking out all the "gee whiz" features you could stack on it I was starting to get a bit impressed.

Using every possible source I could to find out what these things typically cost versus what the actual sticker on them was, I started doing my homework.  After about a week or so I broke down and made an appointment (via email) at a local Hyundai dealership to actually crawl behind the wheel of a couple of these to see what they had.

I test drove a base-model GT 4-speed automatic and also a GT "Ultra Sport 3" that includes the 6-speed manual transmission.  I was much more impressed that I had expected to be in the performance of the automatic's response and acceleration.  However, for control and feel it still can't compare to a full 6-speed manual.

After much haggling over the trade value of my old mustang (I got the price of the car to about $100 over invoice, minus any incentives etc, so was pretty satisfied there), I finally drove home with my shiny new silver Tiburon GT Ultra Sport 3 package.

I've now had the car for nearly a year and have had no major issues with it whatsoever.  The one thing I could complain about is a rattle I've noticed that's gotten worse with time in the speakers on the doors.  I haven&#146t taken it in to see about getting that fixed yet (I still need to take it in for some recall work on the break system, so was planning on asking them about it then), so I'm not sure if they'll be able to do anything or not.  Guess we'll see.

Performance-wise, I'm very satisfied.  It's got smooth acceleration up well over 120 mph and is very responsive off the line.  I'm not into racing, but I still like to be able to feel it when I hit the gas.

Handling could be a bit better in the corners, but again it's nothing that I'd complain too much about.  It's got enough grip that I feel comfortable enough to take steep corners at 40-45 mph, but I do notice a bit of slide as the tires are trying to let go.

All in all, I love the car, especially the looks.  After all this time I'm still struck by what a good job Hyundai did with the lines of their "Shark".
