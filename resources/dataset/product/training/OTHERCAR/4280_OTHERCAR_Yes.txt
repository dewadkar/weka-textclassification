            Looks can be deceiving.  My first reaction to seeing the new Beetle was that it seemed so small.  I was sure that I would feel cramped and so would any passengers.  I soon found out how wrong I was!

I test drove several different cars, including the VW Jetta and VW Cabrio before finally trying the Beetle.  I was impressed with the amount of space the front seat have.  Plenty of leg and head room for both the front seats and the back.  Although the Beetle only seats 4, instead of 5 like the Jetta, I found that the Beetle fit the needs of my family better.    We felt a lot less cramped in the Beetle then any of the other cars.

I was also pleasantly surprised by how much power this little car has!  Cruise control is a blessing and is sure to help you avoid any speeding tickets.  The get up and go is amazing.  It has speed, it handles wonderfully and gets incredible gas mileage.  Put simply, if you commute to work each day, this car is a dream.

I would encourage people to give the new Beetle a shot.  Don't let its size keep you from at least considering it.  It really is a great car!<br><br>
