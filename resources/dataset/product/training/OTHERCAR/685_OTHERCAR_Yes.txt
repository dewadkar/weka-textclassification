            I've had my Nikon CoolPix 950 now for about two years-I'm not sure, but a long time. Prior to the Nikon I had an Agfa, and before that, an Olympus. I have used digital cameras pretty much since they hit the consumer market.

The fact that I've kept this Nikon for so long without upgrading to a newer model is a testament to its longevity and all around utility.

My primary concern with any camera is picture quality. Here, the Nikon shines. I have used pictures from this camera on the Web and in print. I find that if pictures don't turn out with this camera, it's due to shooting conditions: too much motion, or too little light, for example. I find that pictures from my Nikon are frequently better than those from many newer 3 megapixel cameras.

This camera has a range of features, including full manual control. It takes abit of getting used to all the buttons-and the controls and interface are not the best I've used-but they do the job. I should mention that the 950 also has a traditional viewfinder-a nice feature if you prefer more traditional photography, or want to save battery power by switching off the LCD screen.

I like the fact that it uses Compact Flash (CF) media. CF is small, rugged, fast, readily available, and now comes in sizes up to 1 GB. Try that with SmartMedia or Memory Sticks.

The 950 is a good weight-it feels solid but isn't heavy. The casing is either metal or, more likely, reinforced plastic. Either way, it's an extremely well built camera. The threaded lens is metal-a nice touch. The LCD screen is well protected from everything except fingerprints.

I've tried a couple different accessories with this camera. The slide adapter is fantastic for taking quick pictures from slides-provided you have good lighting. It's much quicker than a slide scanner-and, I might add, less expensive. It won't however match a slide scanner if you need high resolution images. I also have a wide angle lens for the camera. Both of these attachments are exceedingly well built, and screw onto the camera lens. This is much better than the attachments for some competing cameras I've seen, which are held on by pressure.

The 950 is famous for it's swivel body. You can frame your picture in the LCD screen and rotate the lens through a 180 degree arc to get your picture. This can be convenient, but it can also be slightly annoying if you're not interested in trick shots. I must admit, I have found it useful once or twice though.

Finally, an essential accessory for any digital camera is a good battery recharger and good batteries. You may have to experiment to find batteries that work well. If you're using the flash frequently, you'll probably eat through a set of batteries fairly quickly. It's nice to know that the 950 uses regular AA batteries-not some proprietary battery pack like some cameras.

To conclude, this is the best, most useful digital camera I have ever used. I have no hesitation using this in place of a regular camera, or on the road. It is well established, uses proven technology, well built, and takes excellent pictures. Even better, you should be able to pick one up at bargain prices now.

By the way, I still don't plan on replacing mine anytime soon.
