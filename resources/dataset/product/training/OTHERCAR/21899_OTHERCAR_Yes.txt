            We recently took delivery of a 2000 BMW 528iA with the sport package and I am shocked.  This car handles better than any other car I've ever driven, including Corvettes and Porsches (this is for normal driving, obviously, rather than race tracks, though I bet the BMW could keep up through the turns).  On top of looking great (we have the leather package and a paint scheme of black on black), this car is comfortable, reasonably powerful (I can see why some people want the V8 in the 540...the 2.8 6 cylinder is good but not a neck snapper), efficient with gas and SMOOTH.  Did I mention how well it handles?  There is something about the way BMW makes cars that elevate the dynamics of steering and suspension to a higher level.  The way the steering wheel feels in hand and the connection it has to the rest of the car is amazing.  

We also have the five speed automatic with the manual shift mode, which I thought was a gimmick.  It's not.  It really comes in handy in the hills when you want to hold the car in a gear through a corner.  

Even though this is an expensive car (we paid $44,000 for the 528iA with leather, moonroof, sports package and xenon lights) its well worth it.<br><br>
