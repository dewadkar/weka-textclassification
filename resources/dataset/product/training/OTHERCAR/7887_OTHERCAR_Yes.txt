            My wife bought me this camera for Christmas and I really love it! I've summarized my feelings under each header here, but if you want technical specs, look here: http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/a20_a10/specs.html

<B>IMAGE QUALITY</B>

I've taken quite a few shots so far, and I really haven't been disappointed at all at the image quality. The only thing I can't figure out is that there's 9 different modes: 3 size modes and 3 levels of compression. I took 9 different shots, and while the size modes are obvious in their differences (the size of picture generated), but compression modes aren't really all that obvious. In fact, I couldn't see the difference between ANY of the compression modes! Maybe I just need to do a little research.

<b>BATTERIES</b>

This is the main problem with the Powershot A20. Sure, you can buy regular AA batteries (it takes 4) but the camera will QUICKLY drain them. It's best to go with rechargeables, but that brings me to my next topic...

<b>ACCESSORIES</b>

One word: EXPENSIVE! The cheapest I found the charger with 4 AA batteries was $45. I think that's kind of steep! Of course, you can get non-Canon batteries, but who knows if that voids the warranty or not. Other accessories are equally expensive: An AC adapter is also $50 (while Radio Shack sells similar generic adapters for $15!), Canon or Simpletech Compactflash cards about $45 etc... If you're planning on getting this camera, you should go for the "package" deals from Canon - should save you some dough.

<b>SOFTWARE</b>

I was impressed with Canon's software, insomuch that it's easy to set up, easy to learn, and is quite good. The camera comes with a special Panoramic mode that makes creating panoramic (even 360 degree!) shots super-easy! In fact, my wife, who works for a property management company is planning on using it to create 360 views of their apartments. Not too shabby! If you *do* want to do something like this, I recommend the free Java-based software from Sven Meier called "Janorama". You can find a review of it at panoguide.com. It's easy, free, and quite capable (considering it's free!)

<b>MISC</b>

Another nicety of this camera is that you can display the images directly from the camera to the television, making it easy to create a video slide-show. It sports a 7.5x zoom (which I don't use too much) - a combination of a 3x optical and another 3x (or so) digital. I don't recommend using the digital zoom, as it will cause your pictures to degrade. Better to just take the picture at the full zoom and use software to zoom in, if you need to. This camera also supports the DPOF printing format (direct camera to printer printing - just drop the compact flash in the printer and you're good to go!) but if you want to take more than 16-20 shots at a time, I definitely recommend buying an additional Compactflash card.

<b>UPDATE</b>
I uploaded my digital photos to Ofoto.com (an AWESOME site...) and I was absolutely AMAZED at the results! You really, truly, cannot tell the difference from film! VERY cool...I'm sure that there are better cameras out there (for more money) but for the price of this camera, you really can't do better...Thanks, Canon!
