            I have to admit - I am impartial to Volkswagens. Not only because I fell victim to their heavily advertized driver-friendly appeal. I owned one before (1997 GTI VR6), and was very pleased with it. I still believe that you get a lot for the money you pay for a top-end VW versus a low-end BMW or Audi which would still cost you more.

Now the time has come for a 4-door car. I still considered a Golf (or rather, its coupe version, the GTI), but the new Jetta really loses nothing in terms of sportiness to its hatchback cousin, and offers the solidity, convenience and style of the sedan.

Compared to another Teutonic hotshot, BMW 325, the Jetta VR6 actually offers the same level of performance, safety, room and cargo ability - but for over $6000 less. Granted, the style of the Bimmer is outstanding, but what the Wolfsburg engineers have done to Jetta (or Bora, as it's called elsewhere in the world) is very close.

Take safety. You want airbags? You've got it: 2 front, 2 side AND curtain all-around. Performance? 180 HP VR6 engine is a marvel. Cargo space? With folded rear seats (not available on basic BMW!), there's plenty. Leather interior may not look overly expensive, but at least it's real (as opposed to BMW's vinyl "leatherette"). 

This car is always compared vis-a-vis the likes of Civic, Neon, Focus, etc. I suppose for the US it is indeed a small car, but it certainly feels big and solid when you are behind the wheel. In Europe, Bora is a mid-size family sedan.

I've got mine in silver colour, with CD-changer and sunroof. Ever since (for 2 months now), I've been vrooming around with fresh breeze into my hair. Rain? No problem. One turn of a switch, and the roof becomes - well, roof. Waterproof and tight.

Now about a few drawbacks. First, the windscreen wipers. I don't know what Volkswagen is thinking, but on both my old GTI and the new Jetta, they are really lousy. Not only they don't have a firm grip on the glass, they get dirty in no time, smearing the dirt all over the glass instead of wiping it. I will have to get aftermarket ones soon.

The VR6 engine, while certainly powerful, is not as fast as on the GTI - perhaps because of Jetta's heavier rear. It also requires premium fuel, which is a consideration with current prices.

The car is assembled in Mexico. VW claims its standards in Pueblo are uncompromized, but I can't help thinking it's somewhat inferior to the truly German-built Audi or a BMW in the next lane. I guess I'd have to wait and see how the overall package behaves itself. VW's bumper-to-bumper warranty is only 2 years (or 24,000 miles), perhaps the lowest of all manufacturers. For the fairness of it, I must mention that engine warranty is 10 years/100,000 miles.

And finally, I wish I waited for the car with a sports suspension. The regular one corners so-so on high speeds, with dangerous tilting. High front seating isn't helpful, either. I just wish I could lower my seat another inch!

Still, overall this is an outstanding car that I hope will serve me well.
