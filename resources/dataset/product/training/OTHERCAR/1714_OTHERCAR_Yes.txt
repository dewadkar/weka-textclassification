            We had been considering the Honda CR-V when my wife's 1990 Honda Accord was a total loss in accident last winter (no serious injuries!). This brought us to the dealer sooner than we expected and I had low expectations. It is rare to see a used CR-V; they go quickly. Fortunately, we found a 1997 CR-V that had been traded in 2 days earlier.

My wife thoroughly enjoys this vehicle. One thing to keep in mind when looking at a car like this is that you can't really compare it to a regular car, or a truck-based sport- utility. It is an excellent cross between these vehicles, sacrificing some of the comfort of a car for some of the height and aggressiveness of the sport-utility. It is fun to drive, handles well for its class and has some really useful features. At first I thought the pull-out table and cooler would be more gimmick than useful, but we have found them to be functional. They come in handy for unexpected stops and last minute trips to the park. Another key factor in our decision is Honda's reputation for reliability, and, so far, this car has not cost anything but scheduled maintenance. Our previous Honda was paid-off and pushing 175,000 miles when it was abruptly taking off the road! I have every expectation this car will live up to that reputation.

There are only 2 cons as far as I see it. I am 6'3" tall and can't seem to find a comfortable position when driving. The other is power. It does lack power, but not to the point that it scares me. We didn't buy it to pull a trailer or climb forest two-tracks (that's what my Pathfinder is for!). If you keep these facts in mind, most people will have no problems with these two points.

Good Luck-
