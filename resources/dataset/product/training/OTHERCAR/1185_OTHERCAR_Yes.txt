            I bought this vehicle because it was inexpensive and a good quality car.  the car runs great when taken care of just like all cars and its easy to handle.  the vehicle is comfortable and it drives smoothly on the roads and highways.  I think the college students and those teenagers that are trying to  but a car this should be there first car because its not expensive and its a great car to have.  The Dodge Neon that I drive is a great car because I don't like to drive very often and when I do drive I get around fairly easy in it.  I have had my Dodge Neon since 1996 and I am fixing to trade it in for a new model I don't what kind yet but I would consider buying another neon if I needed to.<br><br>
