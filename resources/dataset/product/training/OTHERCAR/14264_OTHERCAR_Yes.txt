            i have not had the problems that the other responder has had and nothing close to the price range either. i bought the truck with 87000 miles for $2700. Since then i've done many changes to the exterior such as a sprayed on bed-liner, rims, and a new tailgate. Due to the last owner, I did have a pile of regularly needed maintenence that had not been done, brakes, new heater and cooling hoses, thermostat, fluid flush, air filter, oil change, O2 sensor, and a rear axle seal. The only problem i've really had is the fuel pump had to be replaced due to it leaking oil. It was a REAL job plus for a mechanical fuel pump $60 is kind of expensive. The paint is still very glossy and the truck rides very well. I did find it rather irratating that 'Isuzu' decided that when a truck hits 90,000 that the O2 light would come on. The only way to turn it back off is to take the whole speedometer out and remove a screw. I'm guessing its a reminder to replace the O2 sensor or to get people to go to the dealer so they can make more money. Either way it was annoying. I just did hit 91,000 . I've talked to a few other owners of Isuzus around the same year as mine and have heard of some people getting up to 250,000 to 300,000 miles out of their vehicles.
