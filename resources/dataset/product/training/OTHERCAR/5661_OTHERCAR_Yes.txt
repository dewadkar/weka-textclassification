            If you read my S200 review, you know how I got the S330 camera.  My brother got a good deal on this camera at Dell.com with 10% off and a stackable $25 off $250 coupon.  The final price came out to $324 with free shipping and no sales tax.  The camera's MRSP is $499 but you will find it on store shelves and web sites for $399 and under.

<b>The Short Take</b>

The S330 is the 2002 update to the PowerShot S300 camera that was fairly popular (although I believe it was not as popular as the S110 last year).  The S300 was a solid performer that offered more user features than the more basic S110.  The S330 improves the camera here and there and adds a few new twists to the design and function.  For the most part, the S330 seems to be a tweaked version of the S300 model.

The similarities of the S330 to S300 start with both being 2 MegaPixel camera with 3x optical zoom and 2.5x digital zoom.  The basic camera size is about the same but still slightly larger than the S110/S200 Digital ELPH.  The S330 retains all the features of the S300 with alot of tweaking done by Canon.  Just a few new features make its appearance on the S330 just like on the S200.  Also debuting is the enhanced Lithium-Ion battery for the S330/S200 models... the NB-1LH battery.

The main perceived weaknesses of this camera are the short battery life despite the improved battery, 2 MegaPixel capacity, and a perceivable size difference from the S110/S200 model.  Despite having just slightly larger numbers in dimensions and weight, the S330 feels like a much different and heavier beast than the light and tiny S110 despite what the numbers say.

Again, the main competition here seems to be Canon PowerShot S200 and Minolta DimageX.  However, because of the larger camera size, other competitors include the Nikon CoolPix 2500, 775, 885, Canon S30, S40, several Olympus and Fuji models as well.  The S300 is smaller than most of the camera listed above with the exceptions of the S200, the DimageX, and perhaps the CoolPix 2500.

Overall, the S330 is a worthy successor to the S300 but doesn't warrant an upgrade from the S300.  It is a solid take anywhere camera that provides a bit more manual controls if you so desire it.

<b>Detail Time</b>

If you've seen the S200, then there isn't alot of difference between the two in overall styling.  The S330 has a couple more buttons and an external speaker as well.  The S330 is similarly styled like the S300.

The S330's dimensions are 3.7 x 2.5 x 1.3 inches with a weight of 9.7 oz. with CompactFlash card and battery installed.  Compared to the S200's dimensions 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 inches and weight of 6.6 oz. before CF card and battery (7.7 oz. with CF card and battery), it seems like a scant 0.2 inches in each dimension and a slight weight difference of 2 oz.  Well, that's a 25% difference in weight and the slight difference in dimensions adds up to a camera that looks and feels much bigger and heavier than the S200 camera.  The unit is 0.1 inches thicker but a tad lighter than the S300 unit.  Those of you who are interested in portability should line the S200 and S330 next to each other at the store... the difference is extremely noticable!

Like the S200, the body is made out of a high impact polycarbonate casing with a stainless steel plating.  This change in body design may one of the reasons the S330 is significantly cheaper than the S300 model.  A 1.5 inch color LCD with anti-reflective coating graces the back of the camera with the same 8 large button layout as the S200.  All buttons are easy to press and the user interface is also much easier to use!  The S330 retains the retracting lens that slows up turning on and off the camera.  The lens is automatically covered when the lens is fully retracted.

The 1.5 inch 1.18 MegaPixel color LCD that has existed since the first Digital ELPH was released still displays your photos in fine detail and color... it is fairly easily seen in bright sunlight... and it displays even more information that the previous Digital ELPH models before it.  Information such as ISO settings, file size/compression settings, flash settings, your shooting mode, metering, resolution type, macros, and even a histogram for tonal distribution (which I really don't know what to do with yet... but I'll learn it soon enough).  Photos taken using the LCD screen are just about the photos you are recording to file (95+% accuracy)... since the optical viewfinder is less accurate (85% by some reviews).  I find that the LCD shows most of the picture you are taking versus the optical viewfinder.

<b>It's all about the pictures</b>

The S330 does a commendable job taking shots for 4x6, 5x7, and even gives acceptable 8x10 photos.  My Canon PowerShot S40 gave equivalent photos at the 4x6 and 5x7 size.  Enlarging the shots beyond the 5x7 size is where most 3 and 4 MegaPixel camera show their superiority.  Under the best of conditions, 8x10 photos are rather decent with some loss of detail and slight pixelation which is more than you can say for some 2 MegaPixel cameras and even some 3 MegaPixel cameras.  (My experience has been with mostly Canons, Nikons, and a few Olympus cameras).  The 3x optical zoom is great since the digital zoom is fairly unreliable (as it is for most digital cameras) in maintaining picture details.

Color reproduction has only gotten better in the S330 over the S110 and S300 ELPHs.  The S330 shots look a little more natural to me than the S110/S300 models.  Details in photos are sharp and the automatic exposure controls do a great job in a wide range of lighting conditions.  The AiAF system does a good job in low light conditions although the flash is a bit weak beyond 8-10 feet from the camera (nighttime conditions).  The AiAF system works by using three points of reference on the camera to set the focus of the camera... allowing you to take shots with clear and good contrast with little effort on your part.  (Note that the AiAF system existed in the S300 model as well)

The S330 performs extremely well as a simple "Point-and-shoot" camera.

<b>The outer look of the S330</b>

In some ways, the camera looks like a larger version of the S200... the S330 keeps to the overall stylings of the Digital ELPH cameras.  The camera has a stainless steel exterior that feels extremely smooth for the most part and smudges with fingerprints rather easily, especially the chromed finished areas of the camera.  The front face has a slightly raised, ridged area housing the lens, optical viewfinder, and AiAF lamp.  The diminutive flash sits at the upper right corner (when looking straight at the camera).  The top panel of the camera houses the microphone, shutter, on/off button, and dial for shooting mode.  The dial could be set from automatic shoot mode, manual shoot mode, stitch assist, movie, and browse mode.  The on/off button required that you press it down for 1-2 secs to turn on the camera but a single press to shut it off.  The right panel of the camera (looking at the back of the camera) houses the cover for the Type I CF slot and the wrist strap attachment.  The left panel houses the A/V connection and USB connector covered by an attached rubber cover.  The bottom panel has the battery cover and the tripod mount which lies at the far left side of the camera (unfortunately).

The back of the camera houses the 1.5 inch LCD, 4 large buttons beneath the LCD which are the Set, Menu, Display, and Exposure Compensation/White Balance/Photo Effects buttons.  A slightly raised circular section to the right of the LCD that acts as a 4 way direction pad for the menus and as secondary buttons for features like spot metering, macro/infinity, flash, and continuous/self-timer mode.  There is a thumb rest indentation under the mode dial and right of that is the CF cover latch.  The upper left corner of the back of the S330 is the opening for the external speaker and the optical viewfinder to the left of that.  The upper right corner has two buttons for zooming in and out.  Most of the buttons (except the two leftmost buttons under the LCD) are within reach of your thumb... by the way, I use Medium sized gloves.

<b>Battery Life</b>

The overall battery life is a bit better than the S300 although not by much. With the display turned on and all the automatic features enabled, you might get 150-180 shots per fully charged battery. However, if you have the LCD display turned off, you can take nearly 450 shots! Using the older NB-1L battery cuts the numbers down by nearly 30%! So you get 100-120 shots with the LCD on and 300-320 shots with the LCD off. Too bad the newer NB-1LH battery runs at least $50 and usually in the $70-80 range... if you can find it!

<b>Some Features and File Size Issues</b>

Some new features to the S330 include an orientation sensor so that the camera will automatically rotate the photo into the proper viewing position, support for the CP-10, CP-100, and 820D Canon Photo Printers, the "My Camera" options, "long shutter" mode (for low, dim, and nighttime lighting shots), enhanced white balancing selections, option between 2 and 10 second self timer, sound playback on the camera itself, Exposure/Flash Exposure/AutoFocus Lock modes, spot metering, manual ISO settings from 50-400, and enhanced selection of photo effects directly on camera.

The "My Camera" mode changes simple things like sounds the camrea makes when being turned on as well as backgrounds for menus.  Two default settings are included with room for one more.  You can upload sounds and backgrounds through the Zoombrowser software included in the package.

The continuous shoot mode is actually much faster with the LCD off!  With the LCD on you get a slow shot per second rate, but this rate at least doubles with the LCD completely off. The rate with LCD off approaches 3 shots per sec on certain resolutions compared to 1.5-1.8 shots per second with the LCD on. The continuous shoot mode allows the user to take several consecutive photos when holding down the shutter button. 

You can turn off the AiAF system which gives you a single center AutoFocus point... this does speed up the amount of time it takes to capture photos.  The digital zoom can also be turned off as well.  The AF-assist beam can also be turned off (although I wouldn't recommend it in low night and nighttime shooting).  You can also set the long shutter setting in manual shoot mode from 1 to 15 seconds long.

Resolutions range from Large (1600x1200), Medium (1024x768), and Small (640x480).  Compression ranges from Super-Fine (largest file setting), Fine, and Normal (smallest file setting).  An average Large Super-Fine photo takes around 1 MB of memory.  This gets a bit larger with more complex pictures.

Movie mode is quite limited for the S330.  You can get 640x480 resolution at 20 frames per second (fps) for a total of 4 secs, 320x240 resolution at 20 fps for a total of 10 seconds, and 160x120 resoltuion at 20 fps for a total of 30 seconds.  The total file size of the movie cannot exceed 4 MB and is stored only in AVI format.  I haven't found the movie mode very useful so far.

<b>What's in the package</b>

Canon has always included excellent manuals and documentation for the camera and software included in all their camera packages. The S330 is no different. A good sized camera and software manual is included detailing basic and advanced functions for the camera. A wrist strap is included in the package as well as an updated Lithium-Ion battery compared to the S110/S300. The battery has the same size and shape as the NB-1L found in the S110 and S300 cameras but is now dubbed the NB-1LH and carries 840 mAh versus the NB-1L's 680 mAh charge. The same battery charger is also included in the package. You can use the older NB-1L batteries in the S330 but expect a much shorter battery life. You also get a measley 8 MB CF card... so you need to purchase a bigger one, at least 128MB in my opinion. Two CDs are included with the software for the camera. I use Adobe Photoshop 6 right now... so I didn't try the included software!

I would definitely recommend buying a larger CF card, an additional battery, and a small camera carry case. Remember that you cannot use Type II CF media (like the IBM Microdrive!), so your best bet is 128 or 256 MB CF cards.  If you really want 1/2 GB and 1 GB CF cards, be forewarned that the price runs in the $400 range for a 512 MB (1/2 GB) CF card and at least $700 for a 1 GB CF card at the time I write this.  You should not need more than a 256MB CF card in my opinion!  The AC adapter kit might be helpful too although not necessary (but if you plan on printing directly from the camera to the supported Canon printers, I would get the AC adapter!). I would highly consider at least a seperate CF reader so you don't have to drain the batteries on the camera transferring images to the computer.

<b>About me and photography and the fate of the camera</b>

I'm not a photography student or even an enthusiast. I'm a physician that enjoy technology and gadgets. I know the kind of quality and features I want in a camera... although I have several camera lying around the house. These camera include a Canon S40, Nikon CoolPix 5000, Canon S330, Nikon CoolPix 995. I just know that the quality of the pictures of S200 camera are pleasing to my eye and impress friends when I show them the photos taken by the S200 on a computer screen or developed through sites like Ofoto. 

If you read my S200 review, then you know I first bought that camera... It was taken by my girlfriend and I got back my S110... then my brother traded his S330 for my S110. So now I have the S330 in my possession and now you're reading my review. My girlfriend enjoys the size and flexibility of the S200. My brother enjoys the size and more rugged construction of the S110 (yes, I still feel that the S110 is more solidly constructed than the S200 and S330 cameras and it feels heavier than the S200). I like the S330 because it has a 3x optical zoom and a more robust feature set than the S200 camera although the S330 is a bit bulkier than the S200/S110. I guess we all got what we wanted in the end.
