            As a student entering college in fall of '97, it was time to trade off my 92 Tempo for something new. I got a blue 97 Tracer. Three years later, I still drive it every day and it is an excellent car. 

It accelerates pretty fast for such a small engine, and the automatic transmission goes through the gears effortlessly. Routine maintenance and careful driving have helped keep every thing going smoothly. Only now are the brakes starting to chatter a little bit when they are applied heavily in city traffic.

The overall ride is smooth, but can be a little rough on roads that need some work done to them. There was an annoying squeaking sound coming from the radio in the past when the car was first fired up, but that has since disappeared. The only other inconvenience is that sometimes the shifter lever has to be prodded into park and made sure it is locked securely, or else the engine won't turn off. 

All in all I like this car and i will own it until it has seen enough of me.
