            I leased my 99 Malibu in December of 1998, I thought I was getting a great car, but did I ever find out otherwise.  I was the Parts Manager at the dealer I leased the car from and I also was just given a 99 Malibu as a company car.  The car started out great and was very powerful for a small-midsized car. After just 5,000 miles I had the rotors replaced for the first time. I then had the rotors replaced 3 more times (every 3-5,000 miles)and this all took place in the first two years after taking delivery of the car. 

Other problems I had with the car are: A/C Blower motor replaced twice, A/C control, both taillights, both rear reflectors, both headlights, door molding re-attached, drivers airbag replaced, A/C recharged (bad seal), alternator, battery, transmission rebuilt, ECM reprogrammed, tie rod replaced, steering rack was noisy, front door check not holding door open, both rear window motors noisy, radio clock losing time, drivers seat tracks, drivers seat belt, noisy front suspension, and this car is just all around noisy.

I have gone through the entire process of the lemon law concerning the brake problems and finally went to arbitration with Chevrolet yesterday.  They did hold to their view that it was the style of driving and there was no evidence that there was a defect in the manufacturing of the product. This was their stance even though they have redesigned the rotors 5 times and redesigned the brake pads 5 times. This also not to mention that the rotors have been on national back order on and off for the past two years.  My question is that if it was the way I drove the car than why are they redesigning the rotors and pads? Just for me?

One last side note and then I will be going.  The car I leased was driven almost exclusively by my wife.......I told you earlier that I was given a company car that was identical. I drove my company car almost exclusively and guess what I had replaced on that car three times in one year? Do I hear Lemon?<br><br>
