            We bought this car because we needed a cheap, reliable, family vehicle. We got exactly that. Being a big guy, I needed a lot of leg room, and I hate it when my hat hits the ceiling(you guys know what I am talking about). Our 99 Prizm has held up well to a family of four and two gigantic dogs. If that ain't punishment, I don't know what is. Added benefits were the great gas mileage, good size trunk and great handling on the icy winter roads of Detroit. If you want to know what a great car this is, the only bad thing we could think of was the bad location of the cup holder in front of the radio and ashtray. I would highly recommend this car to any new family, college students and old farts also.<br><br>
