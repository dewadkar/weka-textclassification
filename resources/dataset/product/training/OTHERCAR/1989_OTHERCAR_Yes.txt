            I recently bought a new 2000 Maxima, and love it!  It has had no problems, and has not been in the shop for anything beyond the occasional tune up. This wonderful car doesnï¿½t require much work. The Maxima that I own, has a V6 engine. Needless to say, the acceleration is incredible. You will never have problems pulling out on to a busy road. When traveling on the highway, the car is easy to maneuver, and handles very well at high speeds. I must say though, that the turning radius could be better. The interior of the car is very comfortable. The backseat passengers have plenty of legroom. Nissan fixed the problem that the old Maximas had with the cruise control On/Off switch, so it is no longer a problem.  Compared to the 1995 Maxima that I previously owned, the 2000 Maxima can hold it's own.  The only difference is that the body of the new car is a little bit heavier than the old style.  Even thought you get a few extra horses of power in the new 2000 engine, I believe that the 1995 models had better pick up. Overall, this car is a dream come true. I recommend this car to anyone. If you are looking for a sporty car, the Maxima defiantly has the power. Anyone would enjoy driving this car!
