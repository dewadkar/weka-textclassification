            I own a 97 Wrangler.  I'm still enjoying the ride. With the improved suspension the ride is smoother.  Old Jeep owners have commented the same. I had a problem with the heater when it was under warranty, it was repaired right away.  I did have a few seams come out of the soft top.  The dealer said it was &quot;normal wear and tear&quot;  I repaired it myself.  I am currently having a problem with the muffler.  I've had no other problems thus far. I did run out of gas several times.  I thought it was me until Chrysler had the recall on the Gas gauge.  The other recall was on the air bag system.  Both were repaired in less than a day, In fact I had both recall items done as well as the heater at the same time. In less than a day. I enjoy driving the Jeep and plan to own it a long time. Yes there is air noise,you have to expect it in this vehicle. I find by adding some extra insulation around the doors, and running the fan, there is less noise. The drive is nimble. Besides, what other vehicle do others wave at you, just for the sheer joy of diving a Jeep?              <br><br>
