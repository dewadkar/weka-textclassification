            I received this camera as a gift, so I didn't have a chance to research different cameras and come to my own conclusion, but if I had, the Toshiba PDR-M5 definitely would have made my short list.

This camera packs a lot of really useful features in a nice package. It is fully automatic, although you can also switch to manual mode and compose the picture yourself. I've pretty much stuck to auto for now. The pictures come out very sharp. One warning though, if you are using the flash and are too far away from your subject, then the photo does come out blurry. I would recommend using a tripod in this situation.

The lcd viewfinder is the best for composing your photo. The regular viewfinder tends to not show the whole frame, so if you use it, be aware that the actual picture will be a little big bigger than what you are viewing. The camera also has telephoto and flash. While the flash is not automatic, the camera will tell you when you need it.

The shutter button took a little getting used to. If you hold it down for a second, the camera makes a noise like it is taking a photo. Actually, what it is doing is focusing and adjusting the composure. I missed a few shots because of this. You have to hold it down for a while longer and the actual photo will take. It's not really built to quickly capture shots. In addition to this, when you turn it on, the the telephoto extends half way. In all, you're talking around 7 seconds to turn the camera on and take the photo. The solution to this is to leave the camera on and just turn off the battery-sucking lcd display when you are not using it.

The lcd really makes picture taking fun. It has an easy to use menu and control pad joystick. The only thing I don't like about these types of controls (I have one on my DVD remote as well) is that you have to press in the center of it to select something and sometimes my finger slips and I select the wrong thing.

The menu allows you to select features including self timer, ISO, sharpness, and mode. Mode allows you to take one photo, burst (multiple photos 1 every 1/4 second), 16 burst shots as one image (sort of a little stop action movie and takes up very little space), bulb (long exposure) and actual jmpeg movies which are really cool.

In playback mode you can view all of your photos and movies. You can even zoom in on part of a photo for a closer look. You can also change the size or quality of photos. The camera comes with a video cord so you can even plug into a tv and playback on the tv instead.

All of the photos are stored on a smartmedia card. It comes with an 8mb one and also has an internal memory buffer. You have six total image size/quality settings which allow you to take over 120 photos at the lowest setting.

Hooking it up to your pc is a snap. It comes with USB and serial connections and a decent software package for organizing your photos. The only thing I couldn't find was a MJPEG driver so that I could view the movies in Video for Windows, but you can find one on the web easily enough.

One last good thing was it came with 2 rechargeable batteries, so I never run out of juice. I'll probably end up shelling out the bucks for another smartmedia card. I really hope those things come down in price.

Overall, I'm happy with the camera. I really like taking digital photos as I usually trade photos with friends and family over email. If I need to print one out, most photo stores have a nice thermal printer that prints high quality glossy photos for around $10 directly from the smartmedia card.
