                In 1996 my daughter and I were out looking at cars, something both of us could drive. At the end of the day we came back to this 1996 Chevy S-10, that she really liked. I was hoping to get a bigger truck. But after driving this truck [ LS extended cab,Vortec 4.3 V-6,loaded] I was impressed how this little truck handled and how much punch and power the Vortec 4.3 delivered. We brought the truck home and I'm still impressed,40,000 mi. later. To drive back and forth to work, running around in town,this truck is fun to drive. This truck will run with the V-8's. It's like driving one of the old Chevy's with the stock 327's and 350's , but with the fuel injection, a lot quicker. With the extended cab, bucket seats, two people can take a nice and enjoyable ride. On the interstate highways , this truck with ground effects is a treat to drive. If you get on it ,it does like to drink[gas], but it usually gets pretty good mileage. I'm speaking from a guy who also drives a Chevy and a Ford 3/4 ton, they both like the gas.
My daughter really loves this truck, especially for the looks; and because Dad buys the gas. So far we haven't had any trouble with this truck and every time I drive this truck I like it a little more each time. Drive one today,especially the extended cab. I think you might like it. 
                                              have a &quot; Great Day &quot;
