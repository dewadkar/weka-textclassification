            I've owned this car since new, over 125,000 miles of fun!

My younger brother had already bought a Nissan Sentra and I was keeping him company at the dealer while they prepped it.  The salesman asked what kind of car I was driving and if I was looking for something new.  It turns out, I was!  But not a Nissan, I'd already put a downpayment on a Honda CRX and was just waiting for it to be delivered.  They sent the wrong car, I got my money back and went back to the Nissan dealer to check out the new NX-2000.  

The test ride was a blast! I had to have it!

The handling is amazing.  Forget what people say about FWD cars not being able to corner, this cars absolutely <b>flies</b> around the twisties.

Two adults and two dogs (or maybe small children) will fit, forget about putting adults in tha back seat for more than a few minutes.  I've driven the car from northern California to San Diego dozens of times, to New Mexico, Las Vegas and all over the place.  It's plenty comfortable, considering its size.

In 125k miles I've replaced the clutch, CV joints, and a few sets of tires and brake pads.  'm very happy with the quality of the car, even after nine years it still looks and drives very well.<br><br>
