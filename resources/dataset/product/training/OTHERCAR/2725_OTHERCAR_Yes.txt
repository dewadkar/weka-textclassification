            I have been driving a Caddy Elderodo for the past 3 years, so I wanted to have a replacement that had comfort and all the whistles and bells that make driving a pleasure.  My wife and I looked at all the SUV's out there and decided on the TrailBlazer EXT LT 2WD.  

The first thing that impressed us was the quiet ride.  We could carry on conversations with passengers in the seats behind the driver with ease and the radio could be heard as background without overpowering the conversations.  

Leather on all three rows of seats and 8 way driver and passenger seating with lumbar support, gives the vehicle a  very classy appearance.  When the vehicle needs to be more of a truck, the rear seats fold down to give plenty of space for hauling all that weekend project "stuff" or providing a great space for our two dogs.

Every convenience feature that one could imagine is on board including "On Star".  I was impressed with the way the radio volume changes as interior noise increases and with the earphone jacks in the back so our grandson can listen to Rock on the radio while we listen to cd's in the front.

My wife finds the vehicle very easy to handle in traffic and has no problem with visabilty in any direction.  The average MPG with the second air conditioner for rear passengers running, is 15.2 MPG in town.  The quality of the vehicle is 5 stars with no rattles or creakes when you go over traffic bumps in parking lots.  Acceleration is just fine although not a great as we had in the Caddy. All in all we could not be more pleased with our new TrrailBlazer.
