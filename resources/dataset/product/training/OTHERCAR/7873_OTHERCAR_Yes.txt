            We drive frequently from the North Seattle area to Western Colorado. Our vehicles have been 4WDs from an 86 Audi Quattro to a 97 4-Runner, a Chev 2500 6.5 Turbo Diesel, two Grand Cherokees ( 99 and 02), and now a new Sequoia SR5.

Without a doubt, the Toyota is the most comfortable, albeit the Audi was close. It just too old, and there are few Audi dealers to be found in those 1260 miles. 

This Toyota has so much room and driving range. With 26 gallons of fuel you can drive about 420 miles before the warning light comes on.  Overall, we got 18.3 MPG on regular on the maiden voyage.  This is only about 1.2 MPG less than the smaller V6 Grand Cherokee we traded.

Driving fatigue is a big issue with us, and this SUV is tops. We have rarely been in such a quiet vehicle. The road feel was about perfect. The body does not lean on corners, and highway surface bumps were hardly noticed.

We test drove GMC's, Tahoes and Ford SUV's before selecting the Sequoia.... the difference was immediately obvious.

Our 4 year old Grandson sat in the middle 2nd row seat observing much of the terrain and local features as opposed to being hidden behind a seat in the Jeep, so he asked many questions about what he saw. I left one removable 3rd row seat for the Whippet dog, and all luggage and two computers fit easily below the rear sight line.
