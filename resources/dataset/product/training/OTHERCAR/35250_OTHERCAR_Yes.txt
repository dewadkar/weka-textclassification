            Exterior:  It looks nice in white with black trim.  The breakaway mirrors are nice to have. The front bumper shattered in below freezing weather, so beware not to bump into anything. The tires look a little small compared to the overall balance of the car. It has tinted windows, but you can barely tell.

Interior:  I have the tan interior package.  Although the dash, head rest, and door inlay stay spotless, the tan carpet stains easy. The panel that your channel/temp./and general radio buttons rest upon... scratch easy.  Not a good car for a women with long nails. There is very little room in the back seat in the coupe model, but the front is roomy. If considering the coupe... make sure it has tilt. The stereo system provided a nice sound.  The AC and Heating system are top quality.

Driving:  This car still drives very smooth, but it has quite a few squeeks, especially around corners.  If your sitting in the passengers seat, going around corners, its a bit of a rollercoaster ride, swaying from one side to the next. It feels top heavy, but its not.  When I first got the car, it did very well on hill acceleration, but not anymore!  It sounds like the motor is working very hard now.
