            This camera is so easy to use that you forget that it is a hi tec digital camera. All you have to basically do is make sure the camera is on, point the camera at what you want to take a picture of and then press the soot button. The pictures are suprisingly clear for low the price that you pay for this camera. The Polaroid PhotoMAX PDC-640 Digital Camera is compact enough for tourists who want a good camera with out the hassel of taking film in and out of the camera and they don't have to worry about loosing the film because this camera takes none. I reccomend this to any one who does not want to spend a small fortune on a good quality, small, easy to use digital camera.<br><br>
