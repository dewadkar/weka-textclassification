            I don't owe this car nor have I ever drove it. I am writing this because my husband works at Toyota Motor Manufactoring of Kentucky. This is where is and several other cars are made and assemabled. Yes that's right this is the &quot;foriegn&quot; car built right here in the USA.

This car has very little foriegn parts in it. Most of it comes from different states and is put togethter here in Kentucky. So this so-called foriegn car has more parts made and assembabled here in the USA than any other car on the market.

Toyota also stresses quality over quantity. My husband works close to twelve hours a day, five days a week and more often then not they still ddon't make the numbers they need to to met public demand on their cars and vans. Part of this is if something is wrong they stop and fix the problem before any cars leave the factory. Everything is exactly as it is suppose to be before leaving the factory.

My husband comes home every night tired and worn out. but he says he is happy because he know every car he made today is a great one. Something he feels he could not make at another &quot;USA factory&quot; or even an &quot;American car foctory&quot;.<br><br>
