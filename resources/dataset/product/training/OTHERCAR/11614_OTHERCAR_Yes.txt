            I was having a little browse around the different epinions this evening, and came across this vehicle.
I am a taxi-driver (cabbie) in Dublin, Ireland.
I have always driven Nissan cars ever since I started in the taxi business some 6 years ago, and have owned five in total.
Currently we have two in the family &quot;stable&quot;. A 1990 Nissan 'Bluebird', which I think relates to what you call a 'Stanza' in the States, and our family car, a 1992 Nissan 'Primera', which looks to be what you call a 'Sentra'.
We purchased this car in February, 1999, at a cost of �6,000 Irish Punts. (around $6,300) A lot of you might be surprised at what you consider a very high cost for this age of vehicle, but our motoring costs in Ireland are VERY high compared to the U.S.A. Just to give you an idea; our petrol (gasoline) hovers at around the �3 ($3.15) mark per gallon.
The purchase price of our cars is also very high, the average 4 door compact saloon retailing at about the �17,000 ($18,000) mark. 
Because of this a large market has grown up over the last decade in what we call &quot;Japanese Imports&quot;. These are used vehicles which are imported directly from Japan, are mostly in excellent condition both mechanically and bodywork, and generally have very low mileage.
Our &quot;Stanza&quot; had only 9,000 miles on the clock although it was seven years old at the time of purchase.
As with every Nissan I have purchased, we have found this car exceptionally good value in every way. it is extremely comfortable, with good finish and build quality, and a very high specification. It is manual (stick) transmission, which is the preferred option over here. It is also air-conditioned, which is great, and sports a lovely set of 15 inch alloy wheels. We are a family of three ( one little girl of 9 summers) and it is more than large enough for our requirements, but comfortably seats four adults, with three in the back seat at a push. The boot(trunk) space is very good, and the fuel economy from the 1.8 litre engine is good at around the 30 m.p.g. mark.
The performance is good without being in the &quot;sporty&quot; bracket, but it is on reliability that this car really comes out a winner. As with every Nissan I have had the pleasure of owning,(with the exception of one, we won't bore you with that here) we have had no costs for repairs other than regular maintenance.
Our &quot;Sentra&quot; is a cracker of a car, and the plan is that she (why are cars always female?) will eventually become my taxi vehicle as and when my existing gives up the ghost.
As it says in the title, &quot;Simply the Best&quot;.

P.S. I'm also intending to post epinions on the Stanza (I've owned three, and the Maxima (owned one)      <br><br>
