            Stealth. Great name, great looks. When I went car shopping I was looking for a nice family car. I found it, a Ford Taurus. Low miles, good shape. Then I saw it: the Dodge Stealth. I turned to the owner and said &quot;I'll take it&quot;. You should have seen my wife's face as I got into the Stealth to take it for a test run. I finally convinced her that I had to have it since we already had a 'family' car. Well, needless to say, we are both extremely happy that I was impulsive.
My Stealth is a 1994, which is said to be the best model year, R/T model. It has a quick 3.0 liter 222hp powerplant of an engine, also very easily modifies if you are into that. It also comes in a base model and a R/T Twin Turbo. I decided for the R/T since I knew with the T/T I would hurt myself with its 320 hp. The beautiful design was actually ahead of it's time for the early 90's, sleek, rounded edges and wonderful aerodynamics. Most notably, though, is the lack of exterior ornamentation. The few nameplates it does have are quiet, painted the same color as the car, adding to the mystique and.. well... stealthiness, if there is such a thing. The best thing about the looks? Originality. There really is nothing that looks quite like it.
And performance? Quite frankly, for the money I don't know another car that could hold it's piston rings. Mustang? Forget it. Camaro? Hehe. Corvette? Ok, I won't push it. But you won't pay the 'Vette's hefty pricetag either. 
On the bad side: the ride isn't the best. Unless you do some modifying to the suspension system, you will know everytime you run over anything at all. This is not to say the ride is bad, not at all. Just be forewarned not to expect to be able to sip on your beverage of choice without some difficulty. Road noise is also a slight problem for people who want quiet.  Of course if you like music, problem solved with it's top-of-the-line sound system. 
Bottom line: If you want fast, affordable good looking fun, don't even think about anything else. <br><br>
