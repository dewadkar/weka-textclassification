            I love my truck. 1994 Sonoma 4wd Extended cab w/ every available option.  The ride is decent but the milage is not any better than a full sized truck.  The Extended cab is a godsend even if it tends to clutter up a bit.  They are known to have ball joint problems and there are a couple of recalls out on them.  Don't spend more than book value and I am sure you will like the vehicle.  Get the V6 to avoid sluggishness, or if you get the 4 banger, get a 5 speed!  But you can say that about ANY vehicle!  Fantastic after market stuff available for this truck.   You can make it your own very easily.<br><br>
