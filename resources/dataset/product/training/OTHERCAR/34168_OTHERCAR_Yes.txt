            I went car shopping two years ago, with the intention of buying my very first brand new car.  After having read about the reliability of Toyota's vehicles, I decided to head there first.  I test drove a new Corolla first.  While I liked it, I wasn't head over heals for it.  Then the dealer told me that he just had a 94 Camry traded in and it was in great shape.  It had only 27,000 miles on it and was one of their &quot;certified' used cars.  

What a difference between the Corolla and the Camry!  I fell in love!  The handling of this car was so tight it seemed to anticipate my moves.  The interior of the car is so spacious, that my daughter seemed lost in the back seat.  This car now has a little over 100,000 miles now.  I had to replace the starter a few months ago.  I believe that was the most expensive repair I have had on the car to date, and that was barely over $100.  

I feel very safe letting my kids drive the car, given the safety record of the Camry.  I would recommend this car to virtually anyone.  If you are looking for dependability and safety is a concern, then look no further than the Toyota Camry.  <br><br>
