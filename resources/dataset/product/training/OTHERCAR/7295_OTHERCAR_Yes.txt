            While in the market for a new digital camera, i came across the Olympus D460Zoom model and fell in love almost immediately.  It had everything I wanted...flash, zoom, user-friendly interface.  I was impressed.  And after researching to find reviews on performance and the best price, I bought the camera.  And I haven't been disappointed yet!

The included 8MB memory card can hold up to 122 photos in the standard quality mode.  And to be honest, that's all I need, especially with the ability to edit photos after downloading them anyway.  I took the camera with us on vacation in December, and used it the whole time, neglecting my traditional film-using camera.  And the memory is removable and replaceable too.  You could actually take a full card of photos and protect them from erasure with the click of a button on the camera, then go out and get a new memory card and start shooting fresh.  Personally, I just download the photos and transfer them to a CD to ensure I don't lose them.  But that is a personal choice.

The LCD display lets you review and, if necessary, trash photos that are not what you wanted.  The connection to the computer is relatively easy, and the download is pretty fast in my opinion.

The zoom feature has come in handy, and the photos were pretty good as long as I wasn't extremely far away.  It gave me the ability to get better, closer photos while not having to be right on top of the subject I am photographing.  

The photo quality is great in standard mode, and even better in high-quality mode.  You could easily take a photo in high-quality mode and enlarge it to at least a 5x7 shot and have it look great.  I think that's a big plus, especially if you have children and would like to share photos with the family without taking them out and spending a fortune on professional shots every couple of months.


As for battery drain...I know digital cameras are notorious for being high-drain devices.  But, if you don't use the LCD while shooting, the battery lasts much longer.  I try to limit my LCD use to photo review, and so far the batteries that came with the camera are still in there, and I have had the camera for about a month now.  I would, however, recommend rechargeable batteries to save on having to buy new alkaline ones all the time, depending on how much you use the camera.

Overall, I am enjoying the camera, and I would definitely recommend it to others.  For the price, it's got a lot of great features, and the ease of use itself is worth it!  I think anyone who buys this camera would be quite happy with their purchase.<br><br>
