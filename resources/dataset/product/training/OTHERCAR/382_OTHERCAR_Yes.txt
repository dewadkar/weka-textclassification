            NISSAN STARTED FROM SCRATCH TO BUILD THIS NO-NONSENSE SUV. THE Xterra IS VERY roomy AND VERY STRONG WITH ITS FULL FRAME FOR RUGGEDNESS WITH ALL THIS STRENGTH THE RIDE AND HANDLING ARE SURPRISINGLY GOOD. THE DRIVE TRAIN HAS WHAT SERIOUS OFF-ROADERS NEED AND IN CLUDES YOUTH ORIENTED STYLING WITH TUBULAR STEEL STEPS AND ROOF RACKS FOR A SURFING OR SNOW BORADING TRIP. STRIPPED DOWN OR FULLY LOADED THE XTERRA IS STILL AN AFFORDABLE SUV RANGING FROM ABOUT 17,000-25,000 EVEN WITH THE GREAT PRICE IT STILL LOOKS GOOD THE STYLE OF THE Xterra WILL DEFINITELY TURN HEADS ON THE BEACH I GIVE THE XTERRA 5 STARS I LOVED IT THE ONLY DRAW BACK I FOUND WITH THE XTERRA WAS THE GAS MILEAGE WASNT THAT GREAT RAGING FROM ABOUT 17 TO 19 MILES PER GALLON BUT OTHER THAN THAT I FOUND THE Xterra TO BE A PERFECT 10<br><br>
