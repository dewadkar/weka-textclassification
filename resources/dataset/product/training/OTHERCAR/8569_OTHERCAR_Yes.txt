            We have a large family with cars from Ford to Chevy! We have a Pontiac Grand Am! I love my car! We have not had any problems with our car and have had it for 2 years. We make sure we change the oil in the car every 3000 miles and we have had nothing but good luck with ours. Although I wouldn't recommend it to a larger family, I think for a family of 4 or 5 it is the ideal car. We have 3 children and we fit comfortably in it. 
 
 The gas mileage is wonderful! We get about 35 miles to the gallon on the highway and the car has been so low economically! If you are in the market for a new car, I recommend this car. Just check it out and take it for a test drive, you may just find that this is the car for you. 

 The grand am is a great way to save money in gas if you have to drive a ways to work. And it is one of those cars that you will find that you will want another one when the time comes to buy a new car! If you do decide to to buy a Pontiac Grand Am, I want to wish you good luck with yours!<br><br>
