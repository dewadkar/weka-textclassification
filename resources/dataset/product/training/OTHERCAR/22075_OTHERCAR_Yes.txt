            I was introduced to the Kodak DC-215 Millenium Gold Edition camera in November 1999.  We had just got it in and I was already looking for a digital camera... so I tried this one out and I simply loved it.

It's easy to understand, both the camera and instructions.  It takes some of the best images I've ever seen... even for a little 1MP camera.  The 100+ images you can take also adds to it's characteristics.

Taking a picture with this is pretty much point and shoot.  Using the LCD viewscreen is incredibly easy and selecting the images you want to keep or ones you want to trash is also a big plus for this camera.  Downloading images from their Flash Card to your hard drive is also easy to do using the CF reader.

When I decided to purchase it, it was, at that time over $849.99CDN.  Now it's more like $200.00. 

I think Kodak came up with a winner when they introduced the Millenium Gold Edition with the SanDisk USB Compact Flash Card reader and the 8MB CF Card.

One downfall, I guess is the LCD view screen.  When you use it, it drains the batteries severely... even with Ni-Cd batteries.  One small flaw in an otherwise perfect camera.

I have nothing but raves for this little camera, and I wouldn't trade it for any of the 2+ Mega Pixel cameras on the market.
