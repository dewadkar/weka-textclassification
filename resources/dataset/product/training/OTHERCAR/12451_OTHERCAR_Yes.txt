            A four year old Volvo that looks positively modern? That�s the S40 sedan which has been on sale in Europe since 1996 with an excellent reliability and sales record. Volvo finally introduces what may be their most mainstream-appealing car to the States. Everyone knows they�re safe cars. Heck, I�m not even going to go into safety features because this car has almost ALL of them (Get the brochure, the features all have cute acronyms). You might have purchased a Volvo before for safety, but you might buy THIS Volvo for other reasons such as (God forbid!) styling. 

The 850 (now S80) had a wild angular look previously unseen on Volvos. Take a power sander to the shape and smooth out everything, and you might just get the S40. This is smooth looking car. Really! There are no sharp boxy angles on this car. It makes its big brother the S70 look totally square. It has an uncharacteristic elevated and wide rear which gives it an aggressive stance (ala CLK) that tapers to a smooth front end. The car appears roomy and safe. The single large oval exhaust pipe is a nice touch. The wipers on the headlights are cute, though the windshield wipers look cheap and flimsy.  I particularly applaud Volvo�s doing away with chrome trim and using black or body colored plastic as its only body colors. The wheels are appealing and come in only one style � don�t have to worry about purchasing expensive option packages for nicer wheels. Overall, the S40 and its station wagon sister (V40) are two handsome looking cars and are as un-Volvo as you may think.

The interior looks ample but not cavernous. It seats four a little better than an A4. The driver�s legroom is not as wide as a 3-series but this car has the best room for people with long legs in its class. The previously horrendous interior design of the Volvo has been replaced with something more modest. The dash is sharp and clean, though the curved plastic dust shield casts a warped glare across the instruments when driving away from the sun. The wheel is adjustable. The stereo is typically odd, but functional. The trip computer has its controls on the dash with tiny buttons which make it dangerous to operate while driving. More functions on the wheel or sticks would have been better. The interior leather is particularly nice and plush with nice side panels of leather in the door as well. Though the anatomical wood inlaid shifter looks nice, why does the arm rest and parking brake look so cheap? The interior wood trim looks as silly as it does in any small car. There is also an odd interior light button which takes some getting used to. The speakers are given appropriate placement. The seats are comfortable and have awesome headrests but are not very wide. The lumbar support is not a plus but a must. The ride position is a little high. With the seat as low as possible, you are still nowhere near the low seating position in a 3-series. This however, affords a very good view out the front. Headroom is accommodated with a sweeping arc through the ceiling.
 
When the ignition is turned on, the car lets out a deep rumble � it means business. This illusion is somewhat evaporated by the feeling that this car is definitely a 4-cylinder. Despite the turbo, it exhibits a slow start and though very eager to move, it feels as if it accelerates slowly. The brakes are also soft through its travel, but they do grip well. The steering is very soft and power-assisted with less road feel than an A4 or 32X. The four-speed automatic does shift very smoothly and is willing to be pressed. However, the cabin noise level can become quite high. The 1.9 L 4-cylinder turbo is a product of a long line of good Volvo turbo engines. Producing 160 hp @ 5100 rpm and 170 ft-lb @1800 rpm it should be a strong engine, but it does not have the alacrity or response which its Bavarian rivals possess. Of course, a manual transmission may change my mind. With a higher driving position, this car, though it handles very well for normal driving, tends to have more roll than its German rivals when cornering briskly � feels like an A4 sans Quattro.

The Volvo comes equipped with all standard mechanical features for its base price. Options get you sunroof, leather, and other creature comforts. The SPORT packages are comical �sporty-look� cosmetics packages with no real sport tuning of the car. The options are not very cheap either. If you can�t live without the silver paint, sunroof or leather or nice stereo (which is really nicer than the stock) you will have to pay for that. 

Dealers know this car has had a four year trial in Europe with good mechanical reviews. It also comes with an excellent 4 year bumper-to-bumper everything-but-gas warranty (one up on its Teutonic brethren) as well as 24-hour roadside assistance. And of course, its safety reputation is unparalleled.

It appears that Volvo has indeed become less square while retaining its safety and conservative values. The S40�s ride is solid though it instills some trepidation when pushed, almost as if the car is telling you to drive safer. A beautiful package with good standard features, it will do well with those who can see themselves buying a Volvo (which might be the biggest prejudice against purchasing this car). Hopefully, this car will change this perception. Priced below the A4, the S40 is sure to find many fans with people who want a good luxury automobile with an impeccable safety history that is both sharp and affordable. 

Sometimes it�s hip to be square!
