            Many users like floppies because they're familiar and offer a cable-free PC interface, which is uncommon in digital cameras. But floppy disks provide limited storage space and require an unacceptably long delay while an image is saved. Although the Mavica MVC-FD90 writes images to floppies four times faster than PC floppy drives, it still makes you wait 10 seconds between shots. You might capture your child's first step, but you'll miss the second and third ones. You have to wait about 6 seconds for the camera to power on before you can take a shot.

One of the camera's biggest advantages is long battery life, and the LCD displays the minutes of charge time remaining. But you can't change the batteries while the Mavica MVC-FD90 is mounted on a tripod. That's unfortunate because the camera is unwieldy and hard to position handheld for image composition with the LCD, even though the screen is large and bright. The camera's user interface is a little confusing at first, but once you've run through the features a few times, the clearly marked controls and menus make it easy to operate.<br><br>
