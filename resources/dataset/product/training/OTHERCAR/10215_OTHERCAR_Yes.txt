            If you want a new car, I have no reason to tell you why you shouldn't buy the Lexus RX 300, but I do have many reasons why I think you should buy it.

It's a Lexus. It will cost you less than $40,000 which isn't much for a Lexus. It is a good family car. Easy for everyone to drive. It is good for road trips for 5 people or less. Audio system with 6 CD changer. Smooth ride even when your going at max speed. Leather seats. Information screen. Power moonroof. Safety features.

I don't have the car, but I know so much about the car because I ride in my friend's everyday and I'm checking the car out for myself. The reasons I told you above are just some of the normal features in the car. There are many more additional options for the RX 300.

Go check the car and have a test drive. It might be your next car.<br><br>
