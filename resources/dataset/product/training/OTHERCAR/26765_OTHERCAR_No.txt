            What do you want for the money you spend?  You could spend $10,000 and probably get a really nice camera.  That's not my usage.

I prefer a camera I can take out on the town with me and if it breaks, drops, gets stolen, etc., I don't really care.  That's why I like this.

The pictures are really nice, and with the quality settings you can take a lot of simple pictures, or a few really nice ones.

The screen in the back is easy to see, when not in direct sunlight.  Being able to see you pictures while still out at the party is a blast.

The battery life on this thing sucks.  After about 50 shots, it requires new batteries.  I would say that in the amount of money you spend on batteries, you would probably save money on film cameras, including development.

Then there is the software that comes with the camera, Camedia.  It's quite bad.  There is a new version I got (version 2.0) and it's not much better, a little faster.  Watch your battery life go to heck when you start sucking the pictures off the camera.

For me, though, I'll stick with this.  For the price it's fairly decent.  Plus I prefer digital pictures for my web site.

Happy shooting!
