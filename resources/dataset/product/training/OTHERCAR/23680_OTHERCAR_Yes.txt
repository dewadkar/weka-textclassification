            I have to admitt it, I wanted one before I even was seriously researching it. I feel I got luck via Costco and the contracted Dealer. I'm not trying to sound like a sales person but after reading my own review I have made a few updates to it to try to be more objective. With that in mind read on... 

Either you like the shape or hate it. But even a hard core Toyota buddy thought the ride was exceptionally nice. It's function is not clear. Is it a car? a Van, SUV or Wagon? And it has enough power. It's not a Viper or a Prowler... It's my [P]ersonal [T]ransport Cruiser and I like it!!!

From researching price to purchase, I started a Wednesday night, test drove on the next day (Thursday) and signed the paperwork about 2:00pm the next day (Friday). Why so fast? I purchased the car through (Price) Costco and it was painless. $500 over dealer cost (fixed). 

I just had to pick the color and options. This was Dec 21, 2001. A Birthday and Christmas gift to myself I guess. I've already got 1500 miles on it, not even a first oil change so I can't complain about things breaking yet.

I've seen folks and websites about PT mods. One was increasing the peppie 150-HP output of the 2.4L up to a wopping 271-HP (w/o NOS system) ~320-HP with NOS.

If you want to buy any car and spend $5,000-$10,000 more on tricking it out. Go for it but I only plan to up to SPL a modest amount. It looks good and out exceeds my expectations (based on others complaining about no power); 

I was surprised (even with automatic) it goes from 0-60MPH in less than 10 seconds. It turns on a dime below 40MPH, and can still hold the road well above that -- never the less use caution in any car at high speeds.

I found myself wanting to change lanes and pass a truck... I blinked my eyes and found myself going almost 90MPH; in my Voyager you know it is 90MPH, whereas the PT Cruiser it was deceptively smooth and quiet.

I own both a PT Cruiser and a Plymoth Voyager and the visibility of the Voyager is much better. PT Cruiser rear visibility (even when turned around and looking out the back window(s)) is better during the day than at night. I back mine into my drive way and at night often open the door to verify distances. It is much better during the day so I suspect it mainly has to do with the tinted rear windows.

Cleaning it is a snap but take your time and don't rush it and drive off. That plus road kick-up (the mist from another car's wheels) makes noticable marks on the car. Lines on the Chrysler wings, around the door handles and so on. The car is quite arrow-dynamic so the lines are quite apparent. Pick a color that doesn't exagerate dirt but rather hides it instead!!!

The stock radio+CD+Cassette can be upgraded with a mopar 10-disc changer making the RAZ (I think that is the item code) Radio+CD+Cassette a 10+1+cassette. The system doesn't have line level outputs (I haven't hard checked it, but all documentation and research points that way) so if you want to use the stock system with a sub, you'll need an adjustable speaker level to line level attenuation box, plus a remote power switch to power on the sub.

The floor mats come with hooks so it doesn't slide up into the gas/break/(clutch if you got on) pedals; this is common on newer cars/trucks but it is hear also.

Storage (glove and under passager seat) compartments a on the small size from what is in my Voyager. But it does have a nice place to put CD/Cassettes and spare change (and even a hybrid glasses or two cups).

From what I have read, there is some "tap-down" feature on newer automatic transmission (a software update for 2000 models with automatic) to improve gas milage or something. I can't find out much more about it.

For built in diagonstic (error codes) you no longer need to count a light blinking but rather watch the digital milage (o-meter) for the codes to pop up PLUS you can verify that the computer VIN number matches the VIN number in the front window (to make sure nobody has been tampering with the car).

Keyless entry is a plus but even my dealer recommended 3rd party alarm systems that support bumping and proximity (inside and outside) sensors. 

Aside from that, there isn't much more to add except the altenator is rated for 120A (which is more than my older cars and vans that I've owned in the past). I hope to make use of this for a good sound system.

I'd recommend (Price) Costco's auto program (a website) to anyone for any car/van (#1) and (#2) a PT Cruiser for under MSRP <b>WITHOUT HASSLE</b> is simple awesome.
