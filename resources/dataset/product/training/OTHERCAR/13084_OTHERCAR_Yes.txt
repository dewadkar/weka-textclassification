            First I want to start telling you I am really no more than a beginner. I wanted to buy a top-class 5 MP-camera which would give me most for my money. Eventually I chose this one after comparing with the competing cams from Canon and Nikon.

When I got my cam, it turned out smaller than I first had expected. It also made the cam more difficult to handle. I noticed repeatedly I held one or more fingers on the cam where I shouldn't have put them. Especially my left hand fingers were resting or on the built-in flash who naturally wouldn't pop out then or on the infrared ray emitter. You can't hold the cam with only your left hand, you can merely help to support it a bit. But also the way for hold the cam with my right hand I found unsatisfactory. It is really something I have to get used to more. I wanted a small cam which would be easy to travel with but still easy to hold too. If you put the external flash from Sony on it, you really know how small your cam is. It even starts to look ridiculous.

I also bought a 256 MB memory stick PRO so I would be able to take at least 92 pics + 12 pics (5 MP) from the 32 MB memory stick which came along with the cam. I think it is a bad idea to shoot low quality images trying to save on memory and be able to take more pics. But Sony memory sticks are really expensive compared to flash cards used by other brands, so you won't be tempted to buy too many. I think a better option is to buy an external cd-writer which will cost you just as much as a 256 MB memory stick PRO. When you travel you can always find some internet-cafe and burn your pics on CD. There are external cd-writers who don't require a computer, but that's only for flash cards. I haven't found one yet which can burn pics from memory sticks.

Battery life is short. I really like to work with the LCD-screen on all the time and review pics constantly and erase when I don't like them. So I found it was no luxury at all to have a second battery for my cam. But I think this is just a minor inconvenience.

There are lots of buttons and features on this cam. Take your time to get to know your cam! This is a cam for people who love to take good pics and who are keen on improving.

You really should take the cost of accessories into account! You need at least an additional 256 MB memory stick. Maybe even better is to buy a 512 MB memory stick when you buy an external cd-writer along with it. Then you can better fully utilize storage space on cd's you burn while you are on your trip. Depending on how much you can store on all of the memory sticks you bought, you buy additional batteries. I think it would also be a bad idea to put off the LCD-screen to save on the battery. Buy a soft case, this is not a cheap cam either! This cam shoots amazing pics, buy a tripod for shooting portrait pics, landscapes,... to hold your cam as steady as possible and have the best possible result. None of these accessories is a luxury to this cam, rather a minimum.

I won't talk more about pros, I only want to read about cons myself too. I will only tell you I am very satisfied with all the features that came along with this cam and the image quality. I have nothing to complain about that.
