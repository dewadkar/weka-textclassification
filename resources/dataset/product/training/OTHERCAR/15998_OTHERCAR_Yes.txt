            Back in 1995, my wife and I sighted a used '92 Previa on a car lot and got excited.  It was a pretty maroon LE with the works.  We dickered the salesman down to $16,900 (new ones in town would go then for $35,000).

In terms of comfort, view of road, style...
To this day we cannot find an affordable auto that compares with this deal.

As you can read in other reviews, the engine drivetrain layout is odd (to change the oil, flip back the driver's seat) but it handles well all-season (being tall it is affected by wind) and has enough power for our needs.

Ours has center passenger bucket seats that I wish came out at times.  The rear bench splits in the middle and flips to the sides.

It did average on crash tests.  Only a driver's airbag.

Insurance on this vehicle runs slightly more than our other vehicles, but not really an issue.

Average 19-20 mpg... mostly highway.

Once bought sport tires but HAD to revert back to highway tires, quality of ride very effected.

Weird negative:  Ours has always had a weird spark-knock type rattle that the dealer cannot diagnose.  Comes and goes.  He swears its not the engine at all.  At his insistance we installed a new exhaust header... no change... came off for a refund.  Called Toyota...
no idea there.  So we just try to ignore it....
if something bad comes of it, I'll raise heck.
