            Hyundai is such a competitive car today!  After a rocky past, they have upped the reliability, made their cars affordable, comfortable, and backed by the best warranty on the market.  We liked my Hyundai Elantra so much that we bought my mom a Hyundai Santa Fe three months later - a highly affordable SUV.  IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING AN ACCENT: DO NOT DO IT!  It doesn't come with nearly as many standard features as the Elantra does and most dealerships will make you a deal to get the Elantra over the Accent.  To include all of the features of the Elantra on an Accent model would be a waste of time...it looks like a cheap base price, but that's because it comes with nothing but bare bones necessities!  Get the Elantra!  Anyway:  Here's what I love about the Hyundai Elantra and why you should buy it:

First of all, this car is so affordable!  We have always bought Toyota, with the exception of one Honda, and we were convinced that those were the only two cars, let alone foreign cars, worth buying unless you wanted to spend half your time in the shop.  Well, shop around for Toyota's lower-end car, the Echo, and find that while they offer it for $10,000, once you add in all of the features that come standard with Hyundai Elantra, the price is almost $14,000!  Hyundai Elantra comes equipped with more standard features than Toyota Echo and Honda Civic, and for far less money.  We purchased my Elantra for $10,900, and it has:

Four doors, CD player with six speakers, lots of nooks and crannies for storage like a sunglass compartment, CD holder and insurance holder between the seats, cool rear seat cupholders and cupholders in the doors, rear seats that fold for trunk access, power locks, power windows, power steering, wheel tilt, remote keyless entry, manual transmission (the only way to go), pretty upholstry and lots of storage space.

I have had this car since May 2001 and already have put 13000 miles on it as I commute home from college quite often!  The only problem I have ever had was this: once, my "check engine" light came on, which can show up for many reasons.  I took it to the dealership as the handbook instructs, and it turns out someone who filled my gas tank (I live in Oregon where we can't pump our own gas) had twisted up the rubber liner around the gas tank opening, causing a sensor to go off.  It was very odd but at least I knew the car was sensitive to things out of the ordinary - the Hyundai repair center I took it to repaired it as it's under the great warranty.

I do a lot of travelling and this is a very comfortable, roomy car.  My only complaint is that I'm very short, 4'10", and while the seat moves up far enough for me, the sun visor does very little for me...but that's the case with most cars, so it's not unique to the Elantra.  I also wish it came in more of a color variety.  I love my cranberry colored car, but I was really hoping for a forest green color, and they don't offer a green at all for the Elantra.  But that's not important!

Bottom line is, it's an affordable car, very comfortable with lots of extras that come as standard with Hyundai that don't with other cars, it has a great warranty that they stick by, it gets decent mileage and is far better than most cars of it's price.  Right now, you get more for your money with a Hyundai than you do for any other car.
