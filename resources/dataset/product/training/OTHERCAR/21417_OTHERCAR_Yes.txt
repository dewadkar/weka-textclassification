            Hyundai's 2001 Elantra is a car guaranteed to give
you a bad case of cognitive dissonance or 
at the very least, make you do a double-take!

For starters, it doesn't even look like a 
Hyundai, and the superb exterior design
gives it the air of a much bigger,
more refined (read: expensive) car.

Inside, it feels as spacious as a 
Sonata, and the plastics, while 
bearing that funky smell common
to all Hyundais, seem to be 
fairly decent. The fabric used
to trim the seats is better than
what we've seen in previous
models emanating from Hyundai's
Ulsan, Korea plant.

In general, interior styling 
is pleasant, if a little bland
and non-committal.

The seats are a little hard, but 
reasonably supportive. The driving
position is very comfortable and
non-fatiguing. Amazingly, the CD
player that comes with the car is hooked
up to some nice speakers and sounds
great!

Ergonomics are a little iffy. The
heater/AC controls are mounted low on
the dash and hence a bit hard to locate
quickly. The gauges are very legible, 
but boring.

On the road, the car handles fairly well.
In city driving it's not the nimblest, but
I've driven cars that have been worse, 
believe me. Ample power, even with an
automatic transmission.

Highway handling is good, and the car
is quiet and stable at highway speeds.
In fact, it feels like it's crafted out
of a solid brick of metal.

Overall fit and finish are surprisingly
good, if not quite as precise as that found in
Japanese models.

The low points:

Mediocre braking (especially at highway speeds)
Tinny, flimsy trunk lid
Slightly ponderous handling at low speeds
Very promising, but will Hyundai's quality 
control live up to that promise?
Low residual value (if you plan to 
sell the car after the lease is up,
this is an important factor)

Overall Rating: B+

I'd definitely give serious consideration to buying
an Elantra as an alternative to an equally well-
equipped Japanese model which costs more.


This car offers a lot for a very reasonable price. If
Hyundai continues to improve its quality and reliability,
future iterations<br><br>
