            Well I have to say that the MDX was worth every penny I spent on it. My wife and I just drove to Vermont for the weekend and it performed beautifully. We are both in love with this SUV.

There are very few things we dont like about the MDX so I'll start with those. First, its very noisy driving on the highway with the moonroof open. I expected a bit less 'roar' from a a car like this. Second, we tested the 3rd row of seating with my wife's cousin and her son in the back. She didnt mind going short distances in the back. Legroom was minimal but adequate for the couple of hours she spent back there. The other drawback is that it's awkward climbing in and out of the 3rd row. I was also disappointed to find the spare tire is not full size.

Now on to the good stuff.

The exterior of the MDX is clean and elegant. We opted for a silver, Touring edition with the larger 17 inch wheels. We also got mudguards to keep it clean as possible.
Inside we felt like kings in the large comfy seats. My wife loves the fact she can program the seating position. I was impressed by the visibility the MDX offers especially when backing up. It comes with tinted windows but you can see through them easily.

Talk about room. The MDX has tons of usefeul spaces and has plenty of legroom for the first 5 passengers. I think you could almost fit a nice size cooler on the floor between the 1st and 2nd row of seats. The climate control is also a great feature. Just select a temperature and the car does the rest!

Gas mileage was better than promised on the highway. We averaged about 24mpg for the 280 mile trip into Vermont. The MDX has plenty of power too. I easily passed many other SUVs with ease. The engine ran quiet and smooth the whole trip. (Note: so far my city driving only averaged about 16mpg during my first week of stop and go driving.)

The MDX offers many cool features and amenities that I suggest you take a test drive. I ordered mine in April 2001 and picked it up on August 27 2001. A long wait to say the least. My dealer (near Hartford, CT) said he now has a 6 month waiting list!
