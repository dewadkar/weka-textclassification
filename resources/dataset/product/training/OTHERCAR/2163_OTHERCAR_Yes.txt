            I've always wanted to buy a SUV, something that i can take mountain biking.  But i never liked those big SUV's suburban types that were more for show than off roading.  Then i saw it, a black 4wheel drive(stick-shift) V-6Isuzu Rodeo fully loaded with guards and racks. The rodeo looks real nice, rugged and powerful.  It has plenty of cargo space, power windows and locks.  The only bad part is that it doesn't have cup holders??? It takes me everywhere and rides smoothly like a car, but one thing i noticed is that it has more torque than speed but then again it's an SUV, not a race car.<br><br>
