            Sure, it looks like a bean, and it can only fit one or two people comfortably, and isn't very powerful or too fast, but it's still the best damn car I've ever owned (and no, it wasn't my only car). You may not be the "coolest" guy on the block if you have one, but you're probably the smartest. It gets great gas mileage. It's a hatchback, and that opens up a whole new world of opportunities. It has rear defrost and a rear windshield wiper. Plus, it's compact size and innovative body design allow you to parallel park that sucker just about anywhere where you have an extra six inches or so. Also, those of you familiar with the Plymouth Horizon will have an easy time making the transition, as the two are nearly identical.
