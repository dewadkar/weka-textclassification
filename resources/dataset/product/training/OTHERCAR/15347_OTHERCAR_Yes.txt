            I love this camera.  It does a whole ton of stuff I didn't know I couldn't live without until I had it!  Movies, sound, differnet sizes, tv playback, and more.

The picture quality is excellent.  I love the fact that you can take pictures in email mode.  The send much faster than sending the pictures taken in normal mode.

We have so much fun with this camera at get togethers.  Everyone wants to do movies and take pictures.  The best thing about it is you never ever have to worry about wasting film on a bad shot.  You use a 3.5&quot; disk and you can reuse it as many times as you want.

I think the fact that you can show your 60 second movies or other pictures on the tv is cool.  For my sisters surprise party we froze her surprised look on the tv and had a great laugh.

You also never have to worry about batteries this camera comes with a rechargable battery.

This camera makes a wonderful gift.  The receiver will love you forever for this one!!!<br><br>
