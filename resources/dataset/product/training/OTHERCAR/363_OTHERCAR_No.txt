            I'm sure by now you have seen the commercials.  I'm sure that you've heard the hype (I.E. Motor Trend's SUV of the Year).  Now your wondering: &quot;Is the Xterra too good to be true&quot;?  Well, the answer is a resounding maybe.

The commercials and hype brought me to my local Nissan dealership in Northern California.  I was very impressed with the exterior styling of the Xterra...very rugged and truck-like.  The added Sport and Utility packages give the Xterra an even better look as well as terrific functionality.  I was eager and excited to test drive.  The ride was smooth overall, the engine (which is borrowed from the Pathfinder) was ample and not too noisy on quick accelerations.  The turning radius is awesome.  However, it does tend to roll a bit too much and can get away from you a bit while cornering.  The amount of cargo room inside is great and the convenience features; rear power outlet, integrated first-aid kit, and built in brackets for a bike rack will surely come in handy.

Nissan would have knocked it out of the park if they would have paid more attention to details on the inside.  I felt (and still do) like I was inside of a Toyota Corolla or something.  The material on the seats is very cheap looking and stiff.  The trim around the doors, center console and dashboard, has a very cheap/plastic look and feel to it.  I kept repeating: Functional, Functional, Functional.  The other downside has more impact on rear-seat passengers.  It is very difficult for a full size adult to enter and exit the back seat because of the position of the rear wheel well.

My purchase decision came down to amount of car for the money, but I'm still not convinced that I made the right decision.  Especially when you see the deep discounts on the Pathfinder.  I think that Nissan did a good job in &quot;getting back to basics&quot;.  However, I would argue that the &quot;Basics&quot; inside the Frontier pick-up truck are much more refined than the Xterra.  I  conceded quite a bit on the interior appeal, look, and feel of the Xterra.  I'm hoping that the long-term reliability, and new seat covers will offset the disappointing interior.  

My advice would be to shop around and not buy into the hype.  Take a look at some of the other SUVs that are in the price point of the XE with 4WD, sport and utility packages.  You might find that the other dealers are easier to work with and more reasonable when it comes to negotiating price.  Don't buy this vehicle if you are looking to save on Gas and if you want any level of interior refinement.<br><br>
