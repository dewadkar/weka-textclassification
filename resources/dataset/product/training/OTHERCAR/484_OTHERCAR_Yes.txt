            All my guy friends called my red Miata a 'chick car' but they just didn't understand. This car is not about horsepower, zero to sixty times or drag racing that guy in the Trans Am. 

This car is about style, balance and delightful road manners. And more importantly it put a smile on my face every time I took it out for spin. There's nothing wasted here. From the dash to the seats to instrumentation, it's all done simply yet elegantly. On a sunny day on a twisty road there's no other car I'd rather be driving. Turn off the radio and listen to the exhaust note. Itï¿½s music to the ears. 

The Miata accelerates well around town and on the freeway. I averaged around 24 miles/gallon in mixed driving. The only thing I had to replace in the year I owned the car was the rear window. From reading other magazines including Consumer Reports this car is very reliable. 

I really have to nit pick to find anything wrong with this car. The rear window lasted about four years before cracking due to sun exposure. I lived in Salt Lake City and on snowy days I had a difficult time opening the doors because of the small handles. I could only get one finger wedged in enough to open the door. 

I wish I had held onto this car. I moved from Salt Lake City to Seattle and had a 60-mile highway commute. I decided to trade in my Miata for a VW Passat but I wish I had had the money to keep both. One of these days I will purchase another Miata and I'm sure my guy friends will make fun of it again until they drive it. You just have to own one to understand.
