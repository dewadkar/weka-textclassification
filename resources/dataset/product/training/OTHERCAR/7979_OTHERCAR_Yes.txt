            I wish that Toyota still made Cressida's. Cressida has many
great features but one that hasn't been too publicized is that
the Cressida is the ideal car for short people. It's easy to
drive, the seat adjusts for the short person's perfect fit and
the car is easy to drive. Unlike the 1997-2000 over-hyped Toyota
Camry, which you have to be a football player to drive, the
Cressida is made so you just put your foot comfortably on the
gas and/or the breaks and you are easily driving the car. For the
newer Camry's you must have strong leg muscles or forget it, you
can't maneuver the car. 
The seats, the easyness to drive, and the car's comfort are just
some benefits, there are many more Cressida benefits, The bumper
is one of the best you've ever had. The Toyota Avalons from 1997 to
2000 don't have this good of a bumper. Nor do the other Toyota
models like Camry or Corolla. I feel safer in my 1992 (last year
they made em') Cressida than I would ever feel in a brand new
Year 2000 Avalon. It's like Toyota wants the newer cars to get hit
strongly in the rear so they can make money off of the repairs. I drive
round town feeling safe that my bumper will get the damage rather than
my car receiving a heavy impact...should I ever get hit in the rear.
I wish Toyota would resume making Cressida's. I guess I'll be buying
used late model Cressida's for years and years to come.
