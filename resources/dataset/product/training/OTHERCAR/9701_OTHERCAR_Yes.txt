            I recently purchased my third Infiniti G20 (1996, 1999 lost in a flood :(, and 2001) and have only positive things to say about this automobile. In the 5 years that I have owned this line, I have NEVER had one repair other than normal wear and tear (tires, oil change, brakes, etc.) A random mechanic I took my car to for a tire change told me that Infiniti has the best engine and that I would never have any problems. So far, he has been correct. 

I have the 2001 G20 luxury edition (automatic). ABS, Front/passenger airbags, side front passenger airbags, power seats, computerized climate control, leather seats, Bose stereo/cd, power doors, locks, sunroof, alarm system, alloy rims, cruise control and many other items are standard which meant that it was not necessary for me to add one single item. There is not one item that this car is missing that any of the other luxury cars might have for a whole lot less money. This car handles great around turns, brakes perfectly and provides an extremely smooth and relatively quiet ride. It seats 5 and has great trunk space. 

One of the great things I loved about infiniti was their customer service. As a single parent, if something goes wrong w/ my car, I cannot afford to take time off of work to watch my car sit in a service department nor can I afford to rent one for 2 weeks which would happen if I owned a Honda or Toyota. With Infiniti, you always receive a new Infiniti as a loaner car for as long as it takes for them to make repairs. This feature was very important to me which pushed me to stay with one of the higher-end lines, even though I could have gotten a larger Honda Accord for about the same price. 

The only complaint I have about this car is that it is very slow on the start due to its 4 cylinder engine. I have no idea why Infiniti didn't make it a 6. They marketed this car as a sports car but it pretty much just putts around which is probably better for me anyways (less speeding tickets).
