            The SONY MAVICA was one of the first digital cameras to make it to the mass market, and though it may be an "early bloomer" it is a pretty good one.

The Mavica is sort of like my old '68 Volkswagen: Anyone can drive it, it will endure lots of punishment and screw-ups, but don't expect Ferrari-style power. 

I bought the Mavica for two reasons: to enter the world of digital photography, and I loved the idea of just using 3.5" floppies as the storage medium instead of all those proprietary cable-and-chip gizmos.
Simple is simple.

It is easy to use and it has not let us down yet. It is really finicky about light settings---there isn't much of a fudge factor there (as with all digital cameras) but once you get the exposure setting right you're in business. 

The main problem with the Mavica is that the picture is about like what you'd expect from a Polaroid print: you can make out what the people look like, but don't hold your breath waiting to see if NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC will buy your images. For family stuff you can share on the internet with the family, it is fine. 

The main plus with these cameras, aside from the internet stuff, is that you don't have to mess with film and developing costs and you can re-do any goofs. As a long time print photographer, that makes things really nice. And the neato thing about the Mavica, again, is the advantage a 3.5 floppy gives you over all those smart-cards and other geeky doo-dads. If you're at Grandma's and you wanna see what you've got on the computer screen, just take out the diskette and slap it into Grandma's computer. Voila! It's working! 

(P.S. Of course it helps if your Grandma has made it into the cyberworld and actually HAS a 'puter!).
