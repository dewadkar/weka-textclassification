            I'm a professional web designer and bought the camera mostly for business use.

I spent weeks reading reviews, comparing features, etc. etc. and decided on the 950. I bought the camera when it first came out and got a good deal at the time ($625).

Overall, I am EXTREMELY pleased with the camera. The picture quality is first rate and the camera has many handy and unique features. One of the most useful features is &quot;Best Shot Selection&quot; which will take a rapid series of up to 10 pictures as long as you hold down the shutter button, then choose the sharpest one of the group. Very nice and works great.

The design of the camera is beautiful. It has a nice, solid feel to it. The rotatable body is awesome and allows you to position yourself much more conveniently while looking through the lens - instead of moving your head around, simply rotate the camera body. In fact, you can rotate it back facing yourself and do self-portraits while holding the camera!

I would recommend purchasing a CompactFlash card reader to download photos to your PC. They are very inexpensive (I got mine for around $25) and make downloading a breeze. I'm using a SIIG USB CompactFlash reader and it works great.

The image preview feature is great and versatile and allows you to view thumbnailed pictures immediately after taking them. You can delete the photo right from the camera if you don't want it. Handy.

I can't say enough about the picture quality. Truly amazing. Excellent manual control of settings or choose automatic settings. Automatic does a great job. There's not enough room to mention them all, but there are many handy options and convenience settings.

There are a couple cons:

1. Like other users, I have had trouble with red-eye. Even when using the red-eye reducing flash mode, I still get red-eye quite often. I see the problem more often with children and pets. I use Paintshop Pro 7 to manually remove the red eye when necessary. I wish Nikon would fix this problem.

2. The plastic door that covers the compact flash card poorly constructed. I'm waiting for it to fall off some day soon. The door and hinges are made of plastic, so eventually this door will simply snap off. For a $1000 (retail) camera, this is a cheesy oversight. For a few cents more you'd think they would have made the door more durable. Also, if you use a tripod, the location of the card can be inconvenient as it cannot be removed or inserted while the camera is attached to a tripod.

3. The camera includes an 8 meg flash card, but this sure doesn't hold many photos unless you use a lower quality setting. I purchased a 64 meg card and am sure glad I did. You'd think they would have included AT LEAST a 16 meg card for the price.

Despite the few cons, this camera is absolutely the best digital I've ever used or seen. Nikon's latest is the 990, so it may even be better, but I'm completely happy with my 950.
