            After having my car stolen, I was in desperate need of a new vehicle for a low cost that would be able to handle any situation.  I've had my 95 Subaru Impreza since 1998.  I haven't had a single problem with it for the past 3 years!  After driving through snow storms, hail storms, rain, blistering sun and heavy winds, putting 40,000 miles on it in the last 2 years and making a trek across the United States, any other car probably would have turned upside down and sunk, but not my Subaru!

Being an outdoor person, this car can take me all over the NW mountains.  Having all wheel drive has been a fantastic feature.  I have never gotten stuck in any situation and never feel uncomfortable in sleet or snow.  The AWD keeps the tires firm on the ground and I still get 25-30 MPG.

The only negative feature I have found is that it can be a gutless wonder.  If your heading up steep hills with the air conditioning or heater on don't expect to hit high speeds.  Although it looks sporty, its not built for speed as much as its built for reliability.  For me that is the better quality.

There is plenty of room in this car.  Tall persons may find it a little uncomfortable getting into and out of, but the trunk has ample room for vacations and camping trips.  It comfortably seats 2 adults in the back, or 3 little guys.

This year I will have close to 80,000 miles and will have a basic tune-up done on the belts and engines.  The car hasn't shown any need for repairs, but I want to treat it right so that it will continue to take me places for the next 10 years!<br><br>
