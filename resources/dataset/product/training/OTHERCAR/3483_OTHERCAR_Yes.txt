            We were looking for a new car to replace our aging Toyota 4-Runner...Knowing nothing about Subaru cars, we dropped by a dealership and traded the Toyota in for a Subaru Legacy Wagon (Brighton model) We used the Legacy for a while, but noticed a couple problems right off-(lemon perhaps?) Especially the alignment was crazy, they tried to fix it several times-but it would still pull to the right a lot. Then we began having brake trouble after a couple weeks. 

So finally, we decided to trade it back in to the dealer. 
The salesman recommended that we get a Subaru Outback 2.5L, telling us about the improved suspension, higher clearance, better for our country roads. So we ended up getting an Outback, it has 5-speed manual, automatic everything else, 8-way electric seat, foglights, roof rack, CD player, tweeter speakers and nice Sub-Woofers, key-less entry, etc.

It has been fun to drive, I like 5-speed manual transmission. But this one is very sensitive, beginners may take awhile to adjust to the shifting! It is the most difficult stick-shift I have ever driven. As for long road-trips, this car is more comfortable than our 4-Runner, and it has plenty of <b>legroom in the back</b>!! The sound system is quite simply superb. 

We get a lot of snow where I live, and this Outback does quite well in the winter with its full-time AWD. I am particularly impressed with the new 4-channel Anti-lock brakes, they are effective! But I want to say that this car would in no way do all the off-road driving that we did with out Toyota 4-runner. They hype the Subaru Outback as a SUV, but I wouldn't recommend it very often for full off-road use. Occasional country driving is fine, but the clearance and suspension is not on par with the 4-runner's capabilities.

With the purchase of this Outback, we did not have all the problems that the Legacy wagon gave us. The alignment was great for about a year, then the tires began wearing unevenly. So we took it in for alignment. 

One gripe I have about this car is that, because of clearance, we are unable to use chains with the 16" tires on the car. Studded tires are not allowed on this car either! But so far we've made it on the ice using regular tires...

I've enjoyed using this car more than the Toyota 4-runner. We were told that the engine in our Outback is more powerful than the Toyota. At 165 HP, this thing really has some power for its size. The acceleration is great, especially when passing people!
