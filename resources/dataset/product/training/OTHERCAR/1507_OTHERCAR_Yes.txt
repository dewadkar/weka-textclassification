                 As a full-time college student driving back and forth between home and school I knew it was time to find a car that was both reliable and affordable.  I test drove dozens of cars and was beginning to think I should just settle for the best deal.  A very good friend recommended a trip to the Saturn dealership before I made any decisions.

     I was immediately impressed with the personable receptionist and the courteous salespeople.  They made me feel as if I was part of a family and I hadn't even bought anything yet!  I decided to test drive two models and finally settled on the 1996 SL2.  I had no choice - I fell in love with the car when I drove it!  I loved the smooth and quiet ride it offered and knew it would live up to the safety features the salesman was throwing at me.  I am extremely pleased with the warranty and service agreement.  I get reminders for oil changes and they even wash my car after they are done!  
     
     I am certain that my next car will also be a Saturn and probably the car after that!!  I highly recommend a trip to the Saturn dealership nearest you - you won't regret it!<br><br>
