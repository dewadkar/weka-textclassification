            I bought a 2000 Trooper Limited on 2/12/00 and it has been a huge mistake.  The truck has been in the shop 19 out of the past 37 days. So far the following has malfunctioned:
1)Radio has not worked
2)Sunroof broken twice
3)Idle needed adjusting
4)Ignition cylinder replaced
5)Air Conditioning O rings replaced
6)Gear shift cover not bolted to body

I have never seen such poor quality in a vehicle. Neither Isuzu nor the dealer seem to be too concerned. Their attitude is that this is normal for one of their trucks with all of 2,200 miles on it.

If anyone is thinking of purchasing a Trooper, the best thing you can do is buy a different make.<br><br>
