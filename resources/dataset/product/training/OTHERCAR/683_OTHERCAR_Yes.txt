            Ive had mine for about one year now. Very worthy investment. Ive sold at least 2 as a result of my satisfaction. 

If you have the means, invest in a large compact flash card, it will make you happy. This camera can pay for itself really if you consider how much you would spend on developing 35mm film. 

The colors are richer, more bluish than the Kodaks Ive seen, and the type of compression --even when its lossy, it is not the normal blocky jpeg compression. It actually looks better. You can do print work with this camera. Pretty crazy.

Mac users, make sure you buy a USB compact flash card reader. 

My main frustration right now is that the 990, the upgrade for this camera is due out any day now. Higher image resolution, built in usb port. OUch. <br><br>
