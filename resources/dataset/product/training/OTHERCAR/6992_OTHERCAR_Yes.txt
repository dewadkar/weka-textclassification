            I purchased this vehicle used with 126,000 miles.  My idea was to use it as a winter vehicle to save the wear on my new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  What first impressed me about this car was the roominess and power.  I am 6'5" and I have ample leg and head room.  The V6 motor is quiet, yet powerful.  I have absolutely no fear entering the highway ramp.  The ride is suprisingly quiet and the electronic automatic transmission is the best that I have ever driven.  Granted, if you stop suddenly at a light it seems that the transmission is still up a gear, but that is a very rare occurence.  The trunk is incredibly room and I can easily sit in the back seat.  I have had the car two years and have not had to replace anything except a taillight and interior light bulb.  For the price that I paid and the value that the car has given me, I got a steal.  I highly recommend this car.  The one downside is that the front seats are not very comfortable.  The seat itself is okay, but there is no lumbar support.
