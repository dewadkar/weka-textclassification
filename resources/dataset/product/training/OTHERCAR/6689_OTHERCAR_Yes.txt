            I purchased this car 2 months ago and I love it!!! I bought the C70 HT conv. and the thing will do 0-60 in 5.3 seconds! When you get behind the wheel of a Volvo C70 you will NOT regret it, the handling of this vehicle is breath taking. I felt like I was  going to have a heart-attack when I hit a curve at 75mph. I hardly noticed!! :) This car is plenty luxurious too, it has more standard features than it's top competitors, the Jaguar XK8 and the Mercedes-Benz CLK 320, it also handles better, and has better acceleration times than the Mercedes. The only downside to the Volvo that I have EVER found is that the use timing belts, instead of timing chains that the Mercedes uses. The chains have a lifetime warranty, but you have to replace the belts every 70,000 miles. Of course, 5 minutes in a workshop every 7 years really dose not really bother me.<br><br>
