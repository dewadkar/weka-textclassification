            I bought my 1998 Audi A4 1.8T FWD sedan new in March of 1998.  It has a sport package, an upgraded stereo from Bose (8 speakers), a moonroof, and a trunk-mounted CD changer.  The sport package includes lowered, stiffened suspension, sport seats, a three-spoke steering wheel, and Z-rated, 205x55R15 Dunlops.

I fell in love with this car the moment I saw it on the dealer lot.  It's been four years now, and I still enjoy getting behind the wheel of my A4.  Handling is superb, steering is precise, and breaking on dry or wet surface is very, very efficient.   The sport seats provide excellent support when making tight turns.  5-speed manual gearbox works like a fine Swiss watch.  The engine is peppy, but no match for M3 or Corvette, of course.  Who cares?  The driving experience is still pretty good if you don't let the rpm drop below 2,000.  Driving position is excellent, the sport steering wheel is thinker than normal, making it easy to hold, and the foot rest is well placed. I have observed 24MPG fuel economy with a mix of city and hwy driving while commuting.

This A4 model has a problem with front suspension: some cars (including mine) start making fairly loud noise when slowly going over small bumps (a majority of city streets in Chicago :-).  This isn't a safety issue, but the noise is really, really annoying, as it makes you feel like you're driving a $500 piece of junk.  The noise disappears after a while, but then comes back.  The only reliable solution is to replace front control arms, an expensive part.

Other problems were relatively minor, and were fixed under warranty.  Audi includes no-charge maintenance for the life of the warranty, so it's easy to get used to having the dealer service your car.  After the warranty runs out, those maintenance trips can put a hole in your wallet.

If you plan to drive in the snow, get a Quattro model, and forget about the sport package.  Lower suspension and performance tires of the sport package are not for winter driving.
