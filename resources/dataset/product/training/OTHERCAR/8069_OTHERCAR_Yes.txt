            Although my Nissan Quest is one of the older models without the dual doors, I still feel it is one of the best minivans on the market. 

The first thing I noticed on the test drive was the way it handled. It stayed very stable around corners without the swaying that I had felt with other minivans. It held the road and felt more like driving a car than a minivan.

Small features within the van make it a lifesaver with kids. I can turn the radio up or down and change stations without taking my hands off the steering wheel. I can adjust the air conditioning to blow both in front and back or just in front, depending on my daughter's comfort zone, and I can turn the automatic door lock feature either off or on. For older kids, the radio can be tuned from the back seats allowing them to satisfy their often finicky musical tastes. 

The upholstery seems to clean up easily, even with the messiest of spills, and the finish on the exterior is tough and durable. Both inside and out, it is a well made car.

The sliding door makes it extremely easy to load a child into a car seat, though I wish our model had the sliding doors on both sides like the newer ones. That is the only thing I would fault our vehicle for. With this improvement in the newer models, I think this is the best van on the road for the money.<br><br>
