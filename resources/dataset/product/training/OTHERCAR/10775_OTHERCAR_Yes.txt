            Black with gold broadband around fenderflares and bottom of car, Power windows, Power Doorlocks. Lumbar support, Radio, Am Fm, Cd, Casette, Diesel powered engine. That is basically fully loaded for my favorite Sport Utility Vehicle of all time. face it , it is huge, intimidating, suprisingly manueverable, and increasingly fun to drive. The ride is very smooth and so are the leather seats. The third seat is quite boring though, because you have no control over anything, not air, not windows, not even the radio! so if you are on the last seat, i recommend taking a couple of magazines and maybe a diskman if you radio isnt on something you like. The truck has plenty of head room, and plenty of cargo space even when the third seat is in. Although it is quite expensive, I recommomend it to anyone that can afford this beautiful yet masculine truck. I especially like how you can reach speeds over 100 miles an hour and barely feel it.<br><br>
