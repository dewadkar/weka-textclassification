            The Infinity I30 is as close to a luxury car as you can get without the added cost. The deep leather seats are all power and incredibly room for a midsize car. The backseat is a bench seat and can fit two adults quite comfortably but no more than that. The rear seats also fold down for additional storage space. 

There are front and side air bags for the driver and passenger. There is also a anti-whiplash feature which allows the front headrest to move up and forward in a rear collision. 

The safety belts are all lap-and-shoulder belts except for the middle back passenger. There is also a top-tether anchor for child safety seats.

There are storage pouches located behind each front seat as well as a storage bin under the center armrest and an overhead compartment for sunglass storage. There are also three cup holders in the front and two in the back.

The trunk is large and roomy with a spare tire stored under the trunk floor and a cargo net. 

There is a climate control system although it does not provide dual controls for the driver and passenger.

The power sunshade on the rear window helps keep direct sunlight out and keep rear passengers cool. 

The Infinity I30 rides very well although the steering is a little stiff and hard to get used to. It handles very well on the road and on the highway.

This car is great for people with no children or smaller families. There isn't enough room for more than two children in the back to sit comfortably. The air conditioning does not work well in the back as well. 

The radio controls are slightly difficult to maneuver while driving as are some of the heat and air controls.

We also had a little difficulty with the tether anchor. It seems to be a little off center and required some tough negotiations to install the car seat. 

All in all this is a great car that looks like it cost a lot more than we paid for it.
