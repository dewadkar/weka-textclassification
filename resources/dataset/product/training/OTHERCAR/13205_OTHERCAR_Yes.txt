            I bought the Canon PowerShot A70 digital camera about 3 weeks ago.  I have been using it everyday so if there was a problem I would have found it by now.  Controls are self explanatory for the most part, you only need to refer to manual for the fancier features.  I'm techno phobic so that says something. 

Camera performs very well for both the point and shoot and more sophisticated user.  Simple to use, buttons with in easy reach with your camera hand, it is very light weight and centered so you can take pictures with one hand.  For a small person like me the right size and weight is important.  The Canon A70&#146s shape is a good grip so I don't have to worry about my camera accidentally slipping out.    

Picture image quality is very sharp, clear, colors are true, no distortion.   This camera is worth the extra investment. I did a lot of research and found that between the canon A70 is more superior to the similarly featured Olympus Camedia D-550 Zoom .  Canon is famous for their high quality glass lenses. While the Olympus reuses parts from their older models to keep price down.   The most important thing is high quality lenses; no amount of editing can fix cheap lenses.    This camera&#146s unique in that you can add extra lens attachments.     

Battery life is very good but all digital cameras with LCD eats up batteries.   You can save power with the LCD off.  I strongly suggest you buy 2 sets of 
NiMH AA batteries and a 1 hour rapid charger.   You don&#146t need an ac adapter because where are you going to find an outlet outside?  But it&#146s good if you&#146re going to be doing a lot of indoor shots in a room.

Memory:  it comes with 16mb but that&#146s like 25-30 shots. So you need to buy a bigger memory I have a 128mb.  

Shutter Lag - there's a second or so between pressing button and it taking pics.  TIP: hold the button halfway down before you take shot then when the moment is right you hit the button all the way down.  RESULT?  no lag between pressing button and your kodak moment.   I love that trick.

Transferring to computer is very easy with USB cable provided. You just plug it in and double click icon on your comp and pictures transfer very very fast.    You absolutely need to buy somesort of digital camera case to protect camera.  It&#146s a digi cam so it&#146s sensitive to extreme temperatures.

Price: excellent &#150 I paid $266.00 at www.buydig.com
