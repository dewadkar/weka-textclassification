            I bought a used 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee in early 1998.  The one I chose had the 5.2L V8, QuadraTrac suspension, and most of the options, although it was the Laredo model.  One feature I liked was the skid plate coverage under the chassis.  I used the Jeep off-road a fair amount here in Colorado, and although it's a somewhat luxurious vehicle, it is truly a Jeep at heart.  The only problem I ever had with it was a fuel pump which died on me -- cost about $500 to replace, as the fuel pump is in the gas tank on this vehicle.

In either the older or newer models, music aficianados will definitely want to avail themselves of the upgraded Infinity sound system.  My model had a separate amplifier and six speakers, although some models (like the 5.9 Limited) have up to ten well-placed speakers.  For whatever reason, the sound stage the interior of the Grand Cherokee creates is acoustically quite good.

Other goodies are the center console &quot;vehicle information center&quot; which monitors a number of vehicle functions, some as inconsequential as wiper fluid level  (It also reminds you if you've left your turn signal on inadvertantly), and the overhead console which indicates the outside temperature and compass heading (very useful in the mountains).  This device also shows you just how terrible your fuel efficiency really is.  Obviously, no one buys a V8 for fuel economy, but the 15-17 mpg I got in town is definitely the worst thing about the Grand Cherokee.  Otherwise, this is a very sure-footed and comfortable vehicle.  On long trips, it just excels in the comfort department.

As a footnote, I had my first official wreck in any car last month while driving the Grand Cherokee in some weather that deteriorated from sun to rain to ice in extremely rapid fashion.  In an effort to avoid an 18-wheeler, I lost traction and went off the road, and actually flipped over.  The Jeep was totalled, unfortunately, but despite the relative severity of a rollover accident, I walked away unharmed, the seat belt and the structural integrity of the vehicle saving me from serious injury.  Having gone through that, I can unabashedly recommend a Grand Cherokee to anyone.  I personally like the design of the 94 and 95 model years best, but it is my understanding that many improvements have been made since then, so it becomes a matter of personal taste, I suppose.

The soaring popularity of Grand Cherokees in Colorado must be a testament to their desirability, and as an owner of one for two years, I can give a ringing endorsement.<br><br>
