            When my 1987 Honda Civic Wagon finally got to the point where most of the major systems would need an overhaul/replacement (3rd clutch, brake job, new A/C system and have the transmission looked at) I decided it was time to get a used vehicle.  I looked around a bit, tried out a few vehicles and finally decided to try an Odyssey.  It met all my specifications of head/leg room, good stowage space, pretty decent gas mileage and a great view of the road.  And yes I bought it the same day and haven't looked back.  For its size, this vehicle handles very well on the road even when fully loaded with people (seats 6 comfortably, 7 in a pinch).  I would heartily recommend a Honda to anyone, as I've had only the best of service with them.  Yes you DO need to have the REGULAR maintenance done, but that is well worth the cost as it keeps the major repairs few and far between.

The EX model is the &quot;every gadget we could cram into it&quot; model, and I got the three year maintenance package for that.  I don't trust that much electronics to stand up to regular use.  All the doors are the swing out type, for easy access, and even older adults don't have a problem getting into the vehicle.  My Odyssey handles slick road conditions well, and only once have I felt the anti-lock brakes in use.

If you can't find a current model, see if you can get a good used one from a reputable source.<br><br>
