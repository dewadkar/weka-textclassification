            It's not the car I have a problem with it's the emission testing of it. This morning I took my used car in to Arizona Motor Vehicle Division to have it emission tested so I could tag and title it in my name. What I ended up doing was wasting the whole day at that place. 

The first inspection passed the emission test and failed the equipment test, (they said the pvc pipe was off) Actually it was not off it was kinked and it wasn't even the pvc line! So I had my husband (who is a mechanic and does know what he is doing) change the tubing and go back to the MVD with me. Well this was less than an hour later. This time it flunked the emissions and passed the equipment. 

After 4 tries later and arguing with the employees at the emission testing site and taking the car to a shop and being told their was no reason why it should have failed. The emission place told my husband he couldn't bring it through again today. So yet another wasted 6 trips to Motor Vehicle to still not get my tags!

This purchase of a Used vehicle (which runs fantastic) has truly been a learning experience! I have learned that half of the people at motor vehicle can't tell a pvc line from an oil blowby! If they don't know what a part is on a car they how can they be qualified to inspect one! 

My best advice to all going to purchase or emission test a car, any car. 
Watch and make sure the person who is doing the testing knows the difference in their equipment parts before you allow them to touch your car! It cost a total of 36.00 today to go to emissions and still not get it to pass! Talk about money hungry! Be careful!<br><br>
