            I previously drove a Honda CRV, which drives like a car. Therefore, I consider the Jeep Wrangler my first REAL SUV. The best way I can help you decide if this is the vehicle for you is to list the pro's and con's:

First the Good:

     1.Low Price- For a &quot;real&quot; 4WD vehicle (one of the 1st ever for that matter) it is priced low compared to many other SUV's on the market that don't even have the off road capabilities that this vehicle has. I paid $16,600 for a soft top model with upgraded tires, a radio and cassette, backseat (yes a backseat- this does not come standard on the base model)

    2.Great all season car. It�s a convertible in the summer. In the winter it will get you out of snow banks if you get stuck. 

    3.Lots of aftermarket parts &amp; great people to help with any questions on your jeep- Even if you buy your jeep with nothing on it you can easily by tons and tons of accessories for a fairly low price. If you go to quadratec.com and click on the bulletin board, then click on the jeep section you will stumble upon a community (bulletin board) of Jeep lovers. These people have been a great help to me in picking out what kind of jeep I wanted and giving me background information on the Wrangler. I see all kinds of posts where people give each other advice and help on how to install accessories on their jeep or how to repair something. I can always post a question on there when I need to know something  about the jeep.

4. Visibility- It�s nice to be high up.


Now the bad:
     1. Comfort &amp; ride- While this is a &quot;real&quot; 4WD vehicle, it does not ride as smoothly as up scale SUV's. The vinyl seats (in my SE model) are not the most comfortable seats compared to lots of other SUV's or cars for that matter. On the road you will feel bumps more. 
 
     2. Lack of options on the base model- When you order a base model (on the 4 cylinder) you get no options! It comes with 2 front seats, a soft top, NO radio or cassette, no A/C, no carpeting or floormats

     3.The soft top is very noisy at any speed over 45 mph. There is a slight flapping noise. I am not going to be very happy in the jeep on long long road trips, the noise may drive me insane. 

     4. Putting the soft top down- It may be to early for me to comment on this since my boyfriend and I only put the top down once, but it takes some time to put the top down, it doesn�t just fold down in 30 seconds like a regular convertible. 

    5. They can be broken into easily. I have heard a few too many stories about the soft tops getting slashed as theifs hunt for valuables.

    6. If you plan on spending any time at all in the backseat make sure you can get in and out of it easily! My boyfriend and I are 21 and we had a hard time getting in and out of the backseat. This will not matter to some if you aren't going to be spending time back there. 

Other things to remember:
      Test drive the 4 cylinder and the 6 cylinder models. A lot of people I know are kind of snobbish about the 4 cylinder, but I think its great! The jeep is not a sports car you do not necessarily need the bigger engine unless you are towing something. My budget and high car insurance made me go with the 4 cylinder. Keep in mind you pay about $2000 more for the 6 cylinder.

DO NOT get overconfident in inclement weather just because it's 4WD! Unless there is tons of snow on the road you are not supposed to activate the 4WD, so therefore you are sometimes driving in rear wheel drive in bad conditions and you may fishtail.

I have only had this vehicle for a week now, I look forward to updating you with any more important information I come upon.

I hope I helped you in deciding on the Wrangler!
