            Before purchasing a second vehicle, we were in no rush to buy and looked at compact cars at American and Foreign lots. The Corolla had better control, handling ability and speed than the comparable Ford, Chey, Subaru, Mazda, Mitubishi, and Dodge products. 
Based on price and vehicle we were going to get a Saturn, which compared the most favorable. But we were able to find a dealer who was willing to match the Saturn price, so we went with the Corolla. The Corolla has a bit more style lines. This vehicle is very responsive and holds the road well. 
I am 6 foot tall and have back problems, but have been able to take this vehicle on long trips. Checking fluids under the hood is easy and they have a large windshield washer tank, so you are not filling it up every day in the winter. 
My only caution is the speed of the vehicle, the engine could be smaller and still give excellent performance. When you push the pedal to the floor, you are going to take off, so if you have young drivers at home, they need to be told to take it easy in the car<br><br>
