            I have always liked the new monte carlos since they came back out with them around '95.  I am a truck person, Monte Carlos are the only car I like.  I don't even like camaros or mustangs.  About 6 months ago I went shopping for a new/used car.  I found a 97 monte carlo for a great price.  When I test drove it I knew it was exactly what I wanted.
I have had my Monte Carlo for 6 months now and I absolutely love it.  We have done a few things to it, just general maintenance though.  It has 65,000 miles on it, so we put new tires on, changed the oil, and put a new serpentine belt on it.  The only problem I have had was that the alternator went out on it.  But that is also general maintenance on a car.  
The car runs great, looks very sharp, and drives like a dream.  One of my favorite things about the car is how when you sit in the drivers seat it's almost like you are in the cockpit.  Everything is at arms length and is very accessible.  The car has great pick-up on and off the highway.  The car runs so good, when I start it I am unsure whether or not it is even running.
