            Looking for an economical compact digital camera, I decided on the Kodak 215 Millennium. The criteria were simple. It had to be small enough to fit into a jacket pocket�or my wife�s purse; it should have an optical zoom and at least 1 meg resolution. For the sake of compatibility with my other two (bulkier) digitals, I preferred it to use CF memory and AA batteries as the 215 does.

Like the rest of the package, the 2X zoom is modest, but it works. In classic �point-and-shoot� style, the camera is handy and user-friendly. It is difficult to make too big a mistake. On the other hand, the picture quality is certainly fine enough for web snapshots, but prints are soft and slightly diffuse, the colors mildly unsaturated. It does use up batteries (four AA) surprisingly fast. A charger with a supply of NiMH batteries is a must.

Price permitting, the �Millennium� version is recommended, if only for the dandy Kodak CF card reader that�s part of the package. Since the camera itself doesn't support USB, this can be very useful, indeed. The camera is well-designed and constructed overall, but the battery holder seems fragile. Still, no trouble with anything!

The 215 is probably at the end of its useful marketing life. As technology improves and prices fall it really doesn�t hold its own with the competition. For just a small premium, you can now get smaller units with higher resolution and better features. At half the price, it would still be a contender. As it is, we use it regularly for snapshots and as a �loaner.� It is so straight-forward to use and so easy to carry, I have little doubt we will get our money�s worth.
