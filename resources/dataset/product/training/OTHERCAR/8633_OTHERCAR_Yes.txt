            So much of life is about expectations, it often does not matter what IS true but rather what is true in light of our low or high expectations.  For example, how many of us were forced or coerced into seeing the film "What Women Want," knowing all to well that it would probably be a tear-jerking stinker. And how many, after seeing that movie, said to themselves �that wasn�t so bad?�  The truth is, it is a terrible movie and its only saving grace is that it is not AS BAD a movie as we expected it would be. So it goes with the Kia Optima, the expectation is that this car will be nothing more than a larger version of the cellar dwelling  Rio or the nondescript Sephia.  In the Optima�s case, this diminished expectation actually works in favor of  the car.  After all, how bad could it really be?  

Certainly no automobile could be as blandly styled as the best selling Toyota Camry, but the Optima is no head turner either.  Not a bad looking car by any means, the big Kia�s styling is decidedly conservative.  Perhaps Kia designers were thinking that it�s not cool for upstarts to rock the boat.  From the side the Optima appears to be a fairly substantial car, similar in dimensions to the Nissan Altima. The Optima�s rear is squared off with medium sized, horizontal taillights � it looks a little like an old Chevy Corsica with some Nissan thrown in for fun. Up front, the Optima�s chrome grille gives the car a cheap and tacky look, or a classy expensive look, it all depends on who you ask.  Fog lights are nicely incorporated into the front air dam, and clear lens halogen lights lend an upscale look to the exterior.  The best thing about the exterior styling are the 9 spoke alloy wheels.  They just look cool !

Inside the Optima SE V-6 is an impressive collection of amenities. A power sunroof/moon roof is standard on the Optima SE, but a good deal of head room is sacrificed.  Tall drivers or those fond of hats should consider themselves warned.  Brushed aluminum looking surfaces on the door sills and around the shifter seem as if they belong in a car costing much more than $20,000. Generally speaking, faux wood trim is cause for disdain rather than praise, but in the case of the semi-luxurious Optima, the fake wood actually enhances the appearance of the interior � less is more, as they say. Front seats are a little on the firm side, and one seems to sit ON  rather than IN them. However, a road trip of 2 hours or more reveal the truly benign nature of the Optima�s seating � they feel neither comfortable nor uncomfortable, they just are. 

Although the Optima�s interior is somewhat inviting, it does have its shortcomings.  When optioned with  leather seating surfaces ($995), it is obvious the quality of leather is not the same as in the pricier Camry. Although similar in overall length, the Optima lacks the rear seat leg room of a Toyota Camry. Reading/map lights for the front are a nice touch, however the total lack of lighting for the rear seat is a problem.  Anyone searching the rear for a misplaced CD or trying to secure a �mini me� in his or her child seat would surely need a flashlight when attempting these tasks after dark, or even in a dimly lit parking garage. Sunroof/moon roof controls are difficult to read and lack a �one-touch� feature, one should not have to stop the car just to figure out how to operate the sunroof.  The overall look of the dash and instrument cluster seems a bit sparse.  

On the road the Optima SE V-6 feels surprisingly well balanced, lacking the softness of the Camry while maintaining a little of the sportiness found in the Accord.  Certainly the Optima is no road racing champion, but handling has a controlled feel that empowers the driver in most situations.  During hard cornering, the added weight of the V-6 causes the Optima�s front end to push a little and exhibits some under steer that is less than thrilling in emergency maneuvers. At highway speeds the Optima is almost as serene as the class leading Camry, but large pot holes or dips in the pavement cause quite a bit of jostling. 4 wheel disc brakes  (on the V-6) bring the Optima to a swift stop but can feel a bit touchy.

The 2.5 Liter V-6 is no powerhouse, but normal acceleration does not reveal this cars Achilles heel. Heavy acceleration is when the Optima�s V-6 starts to wheeze, yet  it does its job with little complaint.  The engine noise under full throttle is actually somewhat reassuring.  The Optima�s V-6 exhibits a smoothness and feel of quality that is lacking in many American V-6s. The Sportmatic auto/manual transmission is fun at times, but the novelty wears off quickly.  In either normal or shift-it-yourself mode, the Optima�s 4 speed transmission seems to up shift with little drama but down shifts are abrupt and noticeable. Most of this little engine�s power seems to be in the higher RPMs so shifting the gears yourself to keep the revs high can be rewarding.

Overall the Kia Optima is a fair car that can almost hold its own against the bigger, more established entries from Honda, Toyota, Nissan and others.  When judged on its own merits, the Optima, especially the V-6, is really quite capable.  A smooth, yet underpowered engine, and a surprising level of luxury combined with conservative good looks all work together in making the Kia Optima a worthy choice when shopping for a mid size car.  Add to this a killer warranty of 5 years or 60,000 miles bumper to bumper, and a 10 year or 100,000 mile power train warranty. That warranty alone could be enough to tip the scales in the Optima�s favor.  The mid size car market is an unforgiving battlefield with many reliable and reasonably priced sedans soldiering on in an attempt to capture the flag of consumers hearts (and wallets).  Granted, the Kia Optima will not de-throne the wildly popular Camry, but it could woo a few budget minded shoppers into its quiet interior, low expectations or not.
