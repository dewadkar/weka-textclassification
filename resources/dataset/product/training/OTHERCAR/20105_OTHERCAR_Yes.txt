              The BMW M5, well who doesn't dream of this car. Most high-performance cars require some type of comfort sacrifice. Not this car, It's a luxury sedan with a muscle car engine.

<b> The Interior: </b>
   
   The interior of this car is very elegant. The seats are made of rich grain leather and are comfortable for even the longest road trips. Amazingly there is ample room in the back as there in the fornt. It can comfortably seat two adults in the back, or seat three kids. There is lots of head and leg room, even for Jesse Ventura. In the front the dash is most eloquently designed. The rich dark wood compliments the leather, and sets a mood of passion for speed. Situated immaculately on the dash ia GPS Navigation screen, so you dont have to ask for directions[Men never get lost, they just forget where they put things}.The seats are comfy and the cupholders are wisely placed. There is plenty of trunk space for about 3 golf bags or 1 suitcase. Just imagine yourself in an F-14, with a cockpit made of polished wood and leather. 

<b> The Powerplant/Specs/Suspension/Transmission: </b>
   
   This is the best part of the car to talk about. The Bmw M5 comes with a <b> 4.9 liter/400 horsepower V8 </b>!! 400 horses revving under the hood ready to take you flying across the road at a top speed of <b>157mph</b>! It has plenty of torque so you can accelerate from a standstill at a traffic light to 60 mph in <b> 4.7 seconds </b>! It takes 4.7 seconds to to load a website. The suspension in this car is designed to give you the smoothest ride possible, and believe me it does. The ride in this car is so quiet and so smooth. I would get this car with a manual transmission simply because it is more fun to drive. Switching in and out of gears in this cars is like turning your kitchen lights on.

<b> The Cliche: </b>

   This is the ultimate luxury performance car ever manufactured. Only 1500 are coming to North America. The maintainance for this car is real expensive and to keep it up to par with the way it was when you bought it will wake a lot of money. This beutiful car is lavishly priced at around <b>$70,000</b>. So for me it's still a dream! <br><br>
