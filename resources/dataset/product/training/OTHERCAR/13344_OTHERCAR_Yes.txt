            I have had this camera for almost two years now and I absolutely love it. Its shape and size make it look like a normal film camera. Unlike Nikon coolpix and some other cameras with unconventional looks and it has all the features you would need for day to day photography. All except zoom, maybe.

The downloads using a serial cable is very very slow and for the first few months I stuck to taking smaller resolution pictures because they were faster to download. But then I purchased a smartmedia USB card-reader for about $55 and life has been much better since. Now I shoot only in the high-res mode and just drag the files from my smart-media card to hard disk. Its like normal file copy, no download times at all.

Recently I had some pictures printed from ofoto.com and I was thrilled with the results. I don't have a printer and never bothered with printing photos before. In fact, having a 1.5 mega pixel camera, I always thought the results would be somewhat of a disappointment. Or less than average, to say the least. But I just sent some good pictures for printing (since first 25 prints were free, only shipping to be paid) and when I saw the results.. boy was I surprised!

Now I have purchased a 16MB SM card too. Camera came with a 2MB and another 8MB card (back when I bought it -- don't know what they give right now). The 2MB one holds about 5 hi-res pictures, 8MB about 22-26 (hi-res). With the 16MB one, I can store about 50 more hi-res pictures and now, a total of about 75 are enough for any outing.

If you try lo-res, then you wouldn't even need the 16MB card (or if you get a 16MB with the camera, then you wouldn't need anything else). Lo-res pictures are good enough for web-use but for any serious use, slide-shows and printing, you would need hi-res.

Flash and LCD are adequate. Controls fairly easy to master. It has a timer mode too which is quite handy. Especially because you can always delete the photos you don't like. Battery life is superb. I purchased 4 NiMH re-chargeable batteries with the camera and they have lasted so far and served me well. Software provided was good too (serial transfer is slow, so I don't use it anymore and there is a plethora of free editing software elsewhere too).

One major negative is the slight delay in shooting the pic. You gotta press the button halfway for a focus lock and then press it fully for a shot and even then it takes a fraction of a second to take the shot. Basically, I have mastered the use of this feature so I have no probs with this but new people don't know it. So when I request a stranger for taking my pic with my wife, they end up pressing the button softly (like a normal camera) and it does it focus lock and 1 second delay and takes the picture when the stranger has taken the camera down and thank you-s are being exchanged... you know what I mean.. :-)

All in all, an excellent camera.
