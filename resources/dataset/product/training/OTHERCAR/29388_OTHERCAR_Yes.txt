                This van is our second Mazda MPV, we owned an &quot;89&quot; MPV and we enjoyed it so much we bought a new one in 1992. We bought our MPV primarily to be a people hauler therefor we weren't upset that it's not the greatest vehicle for hauling cargo.

    We've owned our van for about 9 years now and it has about 60,000 miles on it. In that time it has performed just about flawlessly. Last year we replaced the exhaust system and other than scheduled maintainance I don't recall any breakdowns or problems at all. 

    Mazda's MPV is a rear wheel drive vehicle and living here in New England we new we would be needing snow tires. Even if your van happens to be a front driver, getting yourself a set of snows mounted on steel rims is advisable if you live in snow country. We bought a set of Bridgestone Blizzaks for our MPV. I don't think anyone makes a better snow tire than these.

     Our MPV gives us about 20 mpg, not bad for around town errands. 
it handles well but I would recommend 15&quot; wheels because 14&quot; have tires with sidewalls that are a bit too tall and you'll experience a lot of body roll. 

      It's hard to get very excited about something as mundane as a mini-van sort of like getting all hot and bothered about a new refrigerator but then again that's what a mini-van is, an appliance, you just want it to be there whenever you need it and hope you get reasonable service life out of it. Ours has been as dependable as a Maytag.<br><br>
