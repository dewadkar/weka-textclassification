            <b>The Car</b>
We bought a 2000 Passat in May of 2000. My wife loved the way it looked inside and out and immediately fell in love with it. I liked what it offered in the interior. We leased a 4 cylinder GLS sedan with leather, sun roof, winter package, and trunk CD player. It was an automatic, but comes with the tiptronic shifting that lets you shift with no clutch. Although this may be interesting and fun, I rarely ever use it. We got a white exterior with black interior. One thing we didn't like was the patterns the fabric seats had so we sprung for the leather. I would highly recommend it. It holds up well and makes cleaning up spills very easy. Also the black leather doesn't seem to stain easily. The drawback is the black carpeting shows dirt and sand easily so you have to keep it vacuumed. The car drives nice for 4 cylinder. It has a little pep, but if you want any real power go for the 6 cylinder. I like a lot of the interior touches, such as purplish glow of the dashboard at night, the air conditioned glove box, the vents for the back seat. Our model did not have power seats, though everything else is power. In particular, I don't like the manual seat controls. They seem to be awkward, especially for changing the seat angle. To recline you must twist this dial a lot. I prefer the old-fashioned lever you pull up. The trunk space is more than adequate, the CD player and medical kit tucks away nicely in the side wall and does not take away from the space. 
<b>Problems</b>
In the one plus years we've had the car the only problem we've had was with the sun roof. It started making a popping noise when opening and closing. We had that fixed under the warranty and haven't had any problems since.
<b>Price</b>
The car in my opinion was a little pricey. At that time they were so popular that it was hard to even get one so the dealer was not offering much of a price break. It may be better now and may.
<b>Recommendation</b>
I would suggest giving the Passat a test drive. Especially, if you like its unique styling. It is a great alternative to the Audi A4 which is more expensive but very similar.
