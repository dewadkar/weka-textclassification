            The Oldsmobile Silhouette is the brother to the Pontiac Montana and the Chevy Venture. While this is more expensive and more luxurious version, I think that there are many features on it that are very worthwhile. It boasts very high-tech features, a powerful engine and a nice interior.

I felt cramped in this van, but I have never been in a van that I thought was overly-roomy. I was in the car for a few hours, and wasn't displeased by the seating and room but it wasn't spectacular. I think that I may be looking for to much in a minivan, but in long journeys, the more room, the better! The seats were leather, and very comfortable. I thought that they were a good size, and didn't give me any back problems. They reclined with a euro-style turning-knob. It was very easy to use, and I could position the seat in the exact place I wanted to. The sound system wasn't very good. I could only hear two speakers in the very back, and they had a very hollow sound. It sounded like I was twenty feet away from a boom box that was very loud. I could hear the music fine, but it didn't sound good. I know that there are more than two speakers in the car, but I didn't hear them.  The right-side side door is automatic. With the push of a button it will open automatically. This is also on the remote to the car, so you can open the door without doing any work. I did notice that it is hard to close the door manually and if you don't know it is a power door, you'll have some difficulty.

Overall, the interior is very nice. There are two sets of radio and climate controls, so that the back seat occupants can listen to their own music while the drive listens (or doesn't listen to) his music. The ergonomics aren't great, but they are better than most cars. I notices that the dash and all the controls are lower than normal. The windshield was large, and gave a good view of the road, but the interior controls were more difficult to reach because of their distance from the wheel. 

The handling is good, but since this is a van, you can't expect much. On the highway you'll have no problems changing lanes, but I don't think that you're going to want to race with it (obviously). The ride was actually very nice. I didn't feel many bumps in the road and I didn't hear very much wind noise. I wasn't jarred in the cabin and was very satisfied after the journey.

The engine is possibly the most amazing part of this car. It has pickup. Merging onto the interstate is no problem at all. We pushed the car a little, but I think that the engine wasn't real pushed and the result was very fast acceleration. I have never thought of vans as faster cars, but this car changed my view. 

Overall, I recommend this car. I wouldn't buy it because I doubt I would ever need a minivan, and I like very fast cars. But, if I had four kids and need one, I would look at the Oldsmobile. Also look at the Chevy Venture though, it is cheaper (if you buy a base version) and has many of the same main features (engine). This can changed my view of minivans in general and of General Motors cars. I didn't think that they made cars this refined and powerful, but I am glad that I know they do.<br><br>
