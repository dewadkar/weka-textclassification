            Last week, I flew down to San Diego with my wife and son (age 2 1/2).  We rented a Concorde, and I put about 500 miles on it (one side trip to Los Angeles, plus a lot of city driving in San Diego).

The car ran very smoothly and very quietly.  On the carpool lane, driving 75 (the flow of traffic) seemed like 50.

I normally drive a Dodge Intrepid, a similarly sized car, but I was very impressed with the extra space of the Concorde, plus the very small turning radius (at least, small compared to the Intrepid).

The radio/tape player weren't particularly notable, except for the antenna (I could listen to the San Diego FM stations from Los Angeles, and vice versa).

The seat controls (forward/back, up/down, tilt) were a nice extra touch.  And the dashboard was a very easy-to-read combination of analog and digital readouts.

The only true gripe I had was a design &quot;feature&quot; that I didn't care for: the doors automatically lock when you're driving somewhere between 10 and 15 miles per hour.  This meant that, every time I arrived somewhere and wanted to take my son out of the car seat, I would have to unlock all the doors, open a rear door, then relock all the doors.

When I filled the tank, I was impressed with the mileage.  About 20 (or so) in the city, and somewhere around 23 on the highway.  And that's on the lowest grade (87 Octane).  I get 18/20 on 89 Octane on my Intrepid.

In all honesty, with only four days of driving, I have no idea about long-term reliability.  I certainly had no problems.  I would definitely be interested in owning one, but I can't afford a new car at this point.<br><br>
