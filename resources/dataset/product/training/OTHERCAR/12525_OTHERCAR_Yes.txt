             I had began to take less pictures as time went on because of the cost of film and processing. Our video camera was stolen, because we used it so little, we decided to replace it with a digital camera.

Once we decided to go digital, there was no ambiguity. I loved the DSC-F707 that my brother-in-law owns, so when I finally decided to get a digital, I went to get one, only, it was a DSC-F717. OK...... The $800 price-tag seems like a lot, I admit I was hesitant. But after I purchased it and began to use it, I fell in love.

I just don't like the feel of the boxy little digital cameras available. This camera felt like a REAL camera to me. This camera looks cumbersome, but it's really not.

It came with the following:
Camera
LiIon battery pack
AC charger
USB cable
PC software
32MB memory stick (could be higher capacity)

I purchased a 256MB memory-stick-pro with the camera. And have purchased a few more sense.

Although I am neither a pro or beginner, I have used 35mm cameras for years, and all I can say is that this camera can be happily used by both beginner and pro alike. 

Oh yeah...... The ability to take photos/movies in total darkness.
