               <b>T</b>he Letters 'XJR' have really fired the public's interest since the XJR's exclusive introduction in the mid '90s. The latest XJR Jaguar has true supercar performance, thanks to its punchy supercharged DOHC V8 engine, and all the handling agility of a sports car. Before 1997 the famous 'leaping cat' has never before had this type of out-right performance. It is simply the fastest and most powerful sedan Jaguar has ever made available to the public.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   
<b>The only word to describe the seamless flow of raw power from the supercharged 4.0 liter V8 engine is "awesome."</b> Thanks to a friend with obvious taste in luxury cars in I was able to see just for myself how this hot car operated. If you floor the accelerator, the 5-speed automatic transmission decisively down-shifts, and there is instant acceleration on an epic scale. The <b>suspension</b> dispatches bumps with ease, and gives composed, yet enjoyable <b>handling</b>. 
In addition to all the performance, the XJR retains the attribute of providing its owners with a luxury limousine with more than plenty of style and class. 

<b>Cruising</b> on the freeway makes for one of the greatest experience I have had with a luxury automobile. The ride is smooth, and composed at all times. The engine, wind, and road noise are next to none. The Jaguar XJR is the Gem of the XJ range; hands down! Braking is excellent, the 4  wheel vented discs, with 4-wheel ABS make for perhaps too much confidence when approaching a stop. I had almost ran a few stop lights while 'playing' with these excellent brakes, and pushing them to their limits; never did they fail me.  

     <b>A little about this amazing engine:</b> Jaguar's acclaimed AJ-V8 engine first appeared in the XK8 sports coupe, and convertible, and then in 1997 was transplanted into the XJ sedan car range. It is an all aluminum DOHC 32 valve engine with some very advanced features, such as variable intake camshaft timing, liner-free cylinder bores, split block cooling, closed coupled catalysts, and platinum tiped spark plugs. In the XJR performance is taken even further with a big Eaton M112 supercharger fitted, which greatly improves power and torque. For 2001 the XJR boasts 370 horse power, and 387 lb-ft of torque. Because of this amount of torque and power the Jaguar uses a 5-speed automatic from the S class Mercedes.


<i>Interior Accommodation</i>    


    The <b>interior</b> of the XJR screams 'class,' and does it just as well as Jaguar's more tame sedans that are more focused on luxury than power. With the XJR you get both luxury and supercar performance, there is no sacrifice whatsoever. The seats are very supportive, and very comfortable. There is a 320 watt Alpine sound system, Six disc CD, an 'old money' analog clock, a thick wood steering wheel that is partly wrapped in high quality leather. There is also deep pile carpeting, and an on-board navigational system that is optional, and is standard on the Vanden Plas XJR. There is room everywhere, Seats 5, plenty of trunk room for a Jaguar, and plenty of storage space within the cabin. The XJR's interior combines opulent luxury with a sporting favor.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  
The <b>exterior</b>, like the interior screams 'class' as well. There is no mistaking a Jaguar XJ series sedan with any car on the road. The exterior is a little dated, but this design is so beautiful that I would hate to see it go. Unfortunately there really is'nt much of a difference in style from the regular XJ sedans and the XJR.
The XJR can however be recognized by its split mesh radiator grille. The XJR comes with 18" wheels, and big tires.

   The <b>price</b> for an XJR starts at around $69,000, which isn't bad considering the cost of some Mercedes'.


<i>Conclusion:</i>


These cars are not exactly plentiful, so be prepared to go on a good scavenger hunt finding one. The XJR offers excellent bang for the consumer's buck on the used luxury car market. You not only get the luxury so typical of Jaguar, you also receive an extreme dose of refined muscle most often found is exotic sports cars. The Jaguar XJR is definitely worth a test drive!
