            One step on the throttle of this car and you know you've made the right decision. Driving a car that has twice the horsepower of everyday vehicles takes some getting used to, but that extra get up and go is a boon when it comes to merging in traffic or getting across that busy intersection. While idling at that stoplight you'll appreciate the distinctive muscle car burble of the 320 horsepower engine - that is if you aren't rocking out to the superb 500 watt, 10 speaker Monsoon sound system. Most controls and switches for the Pontiac are within easy reach of the driver. Instrumentation is bold and easy to read - day or night. Seats are comfortable and have a myriad of adjustments to suit the needs of individual drivers. Trans Am back seats are a tight squeeze for adults but easily cradle two kids for long or short journeys.

As you might expect driving the Trans Am demands your full attention especially in traffic. Any corner is a candidate for tail-end kick-out. Course correction after such a maneuver is a no-brainer. Lift off the gas and point the nose where it should go and the car behaves as well as the next lane's Honda....the Honda that is, of course, quickly disappearing in your review mirror! 

On the highway the TA is surprising civil and returns a decent 20 miles per gallon. On long or short curves - at speeds most cars struggle to achieve on straight aways - leave the Trans Am begging for more. You'll swear that GM has figured out how to make rubber and asphalt magnetically attractive after a few roadtrips in this car.
