            This might be the strangest review you'll ever read about a Supra, but I feel the aftermarket potential of a car interests many sports car enthusiasts.

Yes, it can kill a Viper GTS, but it's not cheap to get the car there.  Arguably the worlds most cost-effective, after-market upgrade vehicle.  My car began as a stock 1994 Twin Turbo /w 49k miles on it, it wasn't long before it was transformed into a fire breathing, 450+hp, terror on wheels.  If you're into getting some serious bang for the buck, instead of spending the 70k on Viper GTS, look no further than a used Supra.  Sorry, can't get a new one anymore.

My upgrade habit needed a serious car to begin with.  You can't go wrong with a Supra when it comes to reliability, it is a ridiculously over-engineered car.  The stock driver-trane can comfortably handle 500rwhp (rear wheel horse-power), you will need a serious heavy-duty clutch though, I've got a TRD in my car.

The real magic of the car comes from playing with the boost produced by the stock twin-turbo setup.  By getting a boost controller, a means of tricking the computer (Greddy BCC) into believing its turbos are running within spec, and an exhaust system you can push the car into the 400+hp range, yes hard to believe.  This minimal upgrade path will set you back about 1-2k.  You are risking some serious turbo wear and tear but nothing that a complete turbo system replacement kit can't fix.  There are many very high horsepower single turbo kits available on the market.  Most kits come from Japan: HKS, Greddy, Blitz to name a few.  Personally I went with a domestic kit put together by a company called RPS.  I went with a smaller turbo, which allowed me to hold on to the stock fuel system.  What did I get after my upgrade path was complete?  Basically a 450hp monster that can spin its tires through most of first and second gear, heart stopping acceleration!  My upgrade path set me back about $7,000, but if you do the math I still spent below $30k on the complete package.  The most amazing part of my upgrade has to be the cars continuous reliability.  I can honestly say the car has NEVER been in the shop for any serious repair.  I installed most of the aftermarket devices myself, even the turbo kit.

On top of it's amazing upgrade potential you're also getting the complete sports car package.  A great two person interior (the back seats are a joke), great styling, Toyota reliability, excellent stock sound system, powered leather seats, climate control, traction control (I disabled mine), and on most TT models a targa top (the non-targa top is real catch if you can find one, stiffer chassis).

Upgrading a Supra to some serious horsepower can be a serious thrill, let me warn you that it can really burn a hole in your pocket book.  A good general webpage catering to Supras and their super potential is www.mkiv.com.

Some numbers:
I was able to run a 12.6 1/4 mile at 117mph on STREET tires /w a 2.2 second 60 foot time.  It is capable of breaking into the high 11s if I could just find some more traction.

I have seen other Supras run as fast as 11.6 @ 126mph on a large single turbo setup with a stock fuel system plus drag radials and some other aftermarket goodies.  An amazing car!  One more thing, scrap the stock fuel system and go with bigger injectors/fuel pump/etc with a mega sized turbo, then you're in insane horsepower potential zone, 600+hp!!
