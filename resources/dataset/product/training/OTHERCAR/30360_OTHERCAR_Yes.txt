            I bought this car for a daily commuter to work.  I drive over 175 miles round trip daily.  I have an 1993 Justy and it is about broken in now with 204000 miles.  I wish they were still manufacturing them, I would purchase a new one. I have changed the timing belt once and the clutch once.  If I remember right, I do not remember ever changing the antifreeze, just checking and adding small amounts to keep proper protection.  The car will maintain 70 on any highway that I have been on (once and a while I have to downshift from 5th to 4th) and still get 38 miles per gallon.<br><br>
