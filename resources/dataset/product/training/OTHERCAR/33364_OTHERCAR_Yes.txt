            Welcome to my lil Jetta place.
You know who likes it? My friend Chase.
It's really quite nice
Not only in price.
You can get it without that many options
And have money left for your shoppins'.
Inside my Jetta, I don't have power windows,
But neither do your average Joes.
The seats are covered by black leather,
They make you feel like a feather.
The dials all light up in purple and red,
So relaxin you could go to bed.
The lights, they are so bright,
Without even having the high beams on at night.
The leather stick shift is quite nice to use,
But don't be mean to it, Don't abuse
The stick or it'll make you pay,
With all the dough you have to throw its way.
Now to drive it is such a treat,
But to drive a stick is quite the feat.
The alarm and power locks are a blessing
Because I can leave things in it, such as, my salad with dressing.
The steering is quite good,
You can steer all around your neighborhood.
Now that I am finished with this opinion that is betta
Than all the rest, go out and buy a 99 Jetta.
