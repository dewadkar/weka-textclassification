            When I was looking for a new car, it was a tough decision to make.  There are many makes and models to choose from and I wanted to make the right choice.  For me a car is a big investment, anything that I am going to spend $15 000 on I am going to put a lot of research into.  During my research it came down to two cars that I was considering, the Honda Civic Sedan and the Saturn S-Series Sedan.

I took them both for multiple test drives and liked them both very much.  Both the Honda and the Saturn had a smooth ride, manual transmissions, front wheel drive, and four cylinder engines.  It was when I started to read up on the vehicles that I started to lean toward the Honda.

The Civic had a 1.7 liter, 4 cylinder engine, which produced 115 HP.  It had 91.4 cubic feet of passenger space and 39.8 inches of front seat head room.  The S-Series had a 1.9 liter engine, but only produced 100 HP.  It also only had 91.0 cubic feet of space and 39.3 inches of head room.  Because of this I started to really favor the Civic over the S-Series.

I decided to go for one more test drive in the Civic,  I decided that I liked the acceleration that it had when merging onto the freeway much better than that of the Saturn. Also,  the Honda seemed to have much smoother gear shifts than the Saturn.  These two factors were very important in my decision to buy the Honda.

It has now been several weeks since I purchased the car and I have to say that I am quite happy with it.  I have gone on one driving trip up to my Dad's cottage and I felt that the car handled itself extremely well on the drive.  It cornered well and held onto the road quite well during a rain storm that I encountered on my drive up.

I think that this is a good solid car and anyone who is looking for a new car should consider it.  I has ample room for passengers and has nice styling, I think that it would be ideal for just about anybody looking for a car, from a single person to a family.  I hope that this is useful to anybody who is considering the purchase of this car.
