            Hi, I have a 95 Porsche Carrera 2.  The car is a total Club Sport treated car outside, but for the engine, exhaust, and other parts, I use after market parts.  For the engine, I use a DINAN chip, exhuaust, I put in a Triflow medium.  The cat. stays (I live in CA, very strict) and I changed the suspension by putting in a new set of Porsche original sport lowering springs.  I believe it lowered about 3/4 inch in the front with 3/4 in the back.  Porsche told me they believe in lowering the car the same height.  For me, I really hate seeing the space between the fender of the car and the wheel, therefore, I took them out and replaced with an H&amp;R racing springs.  THEY ARE GREAT!!!  Some people said H&amp;R springs are really hard, but it's not bad at all, I used to have a M3 with Eibach Pro-kit springs, and those actually feel quite almost the same with what I have in my Porsche.  The tri-flow medium exhaust are loud enough, for those of you who are into loud, deep throaty sound mufflers, defintely get the Tri-Flow.  For those of you who're not that into loud mufflers, choose the medium one, b/c it's actually quite loud already.  Thank you for reading.<br><br>
