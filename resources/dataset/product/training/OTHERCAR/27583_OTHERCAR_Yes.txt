            I bought my 1993 Pontiac Bonneville used in 1995 after an accident totaled my Buick.  We are a family of five so we were looking for a mid-size to large family car that was both affordable and luxurious enough to make being in it a pleasure.  Since the Buick was paid off, we weren't interested in taking on &quot;new car&quot; payment that would be with us for the next six years.  

At first I didn't like the body style of the Bonneville and wasn't that interested in looking at them, but I quickly changed my mind when I climbed inside and settled down into the plush softness of the interior.  I was further enticed by the sporty look and feel of the dashboard and steering wheel.  I felt like I was back in my pre-kid days when sporty was more important than practical.  Although seating is available for three in the front seat, the car features a split so that both the driver and the passenger can adjust their seats as they desire.  

But of course, more practical things needed to be considered so we looked into the track record for this model.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the Bonneville was rated highly in all categories by Consumer Reports, especially reliability.    

Now, four and one half years down the road, we have never regretted purchasing this car.  We live a good distance from our extended family and this car makes the long drive enjoyable both in driving and riding.  She now has over 92,000 miles on her and she runs like a charm.  The only thing that has been replaced on this except for routine maintenance items, is the alternator.  Gas mileage is average for a car this size and you get a lot of luxury for the money.  I'm expecting several more miles and few good years yet out of my Bonneville.   <br><br>
