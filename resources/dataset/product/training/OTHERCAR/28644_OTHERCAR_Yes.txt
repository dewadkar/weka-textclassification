            I have been posting images to the Internet for a couple of year now and it was always the same old routine: buy film, take the pictures (and hope for the best), have the film processed, scan the acceptable shots into the computer and then upload them to the web.  To me it didn't seem like the best way to handle the steps.  So I started looking at digital cameras.
My main objective was to find a decent camera at a very reasonable price - my choice the Kodak DC200 Plus.

The DC200Plus comes with the following features:
Megapixel picture resolution - 1152 by 864 pixels
Point and shoot
Auto exposure
Focal range from 27 inches to infinity
4 megs of memory on the card provided
Serial connection to your computer
Uses 4AA batteries
Tripod mount
Video out connection for hook up to TV or VCR
Self Timer

I know this may sound a little overwhelming if you have never used a digital camera before - but it's a great little camera.  I took over 400 picture in a three month period and I have found it very useful for Internet imaging.
The thing that I find most useful is the instant access to the picture.  If I take a picture, I look at the preview - If I like it, I keep it, if I don't I delete it and try again.  This way the only images I store in the camera are the one's that I plan to use. (It beats processing a 36 exposure roll and only being able to use four or five.)
One thing that I do is that I still keep my 35mm handy - if I take a picture with the digital camera and it looks good on the preview - I take out the 35mm and commit an image to film.  This way if I take something that I eventually want to have enlarged I will have a higher quality negative to work with.
The images produced by the camera are also printable - but I would not recommend enlarging them to anything larger than a 5 by 7.  But they are very functional for the Internet.

The transfer to the PC is very acceptable and the software that comes with the camera does a very good job printing the images.

I have updated the firmware in the camera once since I purchased it.  It was very easy - download the software - connect the camera - run the software - Boom, it's done.

What it lacks.
The camera is a battery hog.  Buy rechargeable batteries and a charger.
The memory card should have been larger - if you use the standard resolution, the camera will hold about 35 images.  In the highest setting the camera will only hold about 9.
Kodak should have included an AC adapter with the camera.
The view hole (if you call it that) doesn't line up with the lens of the camera.  This takes a little getting used to, but it should not stop you from purchasing the camera.

Overall - A good camera for the beginning digital user.  The cost is right and the camera is very user friendly.
