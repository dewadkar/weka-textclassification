            I upgraded to this after buying one of the last S100's available. (My S100 wasn't working right, so I had to exchange - blessing in disguise).

I really enjoy using this little camera, it has almost everything that one would expect in a camera, plus little features that you didn't expect. Canon's software bundle is really very nice, and extremly easy to use.

Picture quality has been excellent on the S300 (S100 had some problems, but if it was working, I would assume the same) and operation of the camera is quite simple once you have used it for a little while. The one downside is that it is very limited when using indoors with lower light, or outdoors in the evening. I expect this limitation is similar to most smaller, compact camera's, but it really wasn't what I was looking for. In low light, don't bother using the camera unless you know you will be within 6-10 feet of whatever you are photographing.

I don't think anyone would be disappointed in the results, compared to most 35mm or APS cameras.

It also has the ability to go under water with the optional under water case. 

Picture quality is really very good and I have experimented with printing the pictures (8x10's in my office now, and unless you go nose to nose you couldn't tell they were digital!! - Lexmark Z31 and photo paper), putting the on a Video CD to watch on the DVD player & TV, etc. and all work really well. (Some require additional software)

There were only a few things that I think could be better:

1) Canon should include a small case, they do with there $250 dollar APS Camera, but not there $850 Digital...
2) Battery life could be better, but is a improvement over the S100 (Same battery)
3) AC Adapter should come included.
4) Movie mode (larger files) with no support for the type II compact flash microdrives!!!!!! Dumb, really dumb....
5) LOW LIGHT ability is very narow.
6) Lack of manual control and overides.

All features on the camera work well, and other than a few minor disappointments above, I was very happy with the camera. But I tend to want more than most people when looking at things, so I decided to take a look at the Canon G1 instead.

As with most if not all Digital cameras on the market, all acccessories tend to be extra, and tend to be expensive. This is not in any means uncommon, but is really inconvient, and stupid.

For a point and shoot outdoor camera, you will not be disappointed, but for a complete all around camera, you probably won't like it.
