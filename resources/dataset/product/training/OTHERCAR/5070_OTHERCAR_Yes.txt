            This is my first experience with a digital camera and I like it a lot. I like the fact that it uses 3.5" computer diskettes - no film to buy.

I keep the battery charger right on my desk and it is easy to pop out the battery and into the charger. It seems to me that it charges quickly.

It's easy to see the potential picture in the window, but not in much detail. After clicking the picture it is just the flick of a button to see review it. I like that! It's easy to navigate and if I don't like it, take a new one. I think this function is easy for me because I've worked with computer menu's for years and navigation through a menu is the same.

I use it to take pictures to post on internet auctions. I received this camera as a gift so am estimating the price but I have used it more than any other gift I've ever been given. For my uses it's perfect! Snap a picture, slip the disk into the computer, lighten and publish my auction.

The only thing I don't like a about the picture quality is that I need to lighten them so the details can be seen. I have a good home publishing program for that and it makes this not an issue for me, now. I'm not sure about photo quality because the only actual pictures it's been used for were lightened and then printed on plain paper, so no photo quality testing has been done.

Oh, one other little irritation is the date stamp on the camera cannot be turned off and it takes up room on the diskette.
