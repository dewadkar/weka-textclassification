            I'm a person who has to totally research products before I buy them. I'll spend literally days doing it. When I was in the market for a digital camera, I was looking for specific features and of course the lowest cost. I needed a simple camera with certain features because I was basically just going to use it to take pictures of my two kids to e-mail to relatives and didn't want to invest hundreds of dollars into a camera. I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a camera because I've got two kids, remember? :)

This little digital camera was perfect for me and my family! It is one of the lowest priced cameras for what it offers in features. 

I needed a camera that was so easy to use that a kid could use it. Why? Because a kid WAS going to use it. No instructions needed, she just took it and away she went taking pictures. It was that easy!

As for features, this camera had everything I needed, great resolution, different flash "modes", battery/AC adapter powered, LCD view screen, and it uses memory cards.

I definitely needed a camera that could use a memory card instead of having "internal memory." If you take a lot of pictures and aren't always near a computer, you ABSOLUTELY NEED a camera that uses memory cards. (Always buy an extra memory card, even if it's only 2MB. Remember those times when you ran out of film and missed that "oh so perfect" shot? With cameras that use internal memory, there's no way you can get that extra shot without deleting a picture. With cameras that use memory cards, just pop in the other card!) This is one of the main reasons I love my camera!

The camera also looks like a camera, which is great because those others look too down right intimidating to use. And some of them are quite large too. This is nice and normal sized, like your average 35mm camera.

The LCD screen is great! You can view your pictures after you've taken them and delete those bad shots right away (or later if you prefer) and it also helps in focusing on a shot.

About the only things I don't like about this camera is the fact that it uses a serial connection and not a USB connection and, as someone once said to me, "It eats more batteries than a billy goat!" (but that is only if you use the LCD screen for focusing a lot, which I do.) USB connection gives a faster transfer rate for the pictures from your camera to your computer, but if you're not too concerned about it, I would still recommend this camera. As for the batteries, there are AC adapters that you can use instead.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone. In fact, I loved this camera so much that I bought another one for my in-laws and they love it more than I do! 

(Did I mention that I bought both cameras used? So even after they've been used for a while, they're still going strong!)
