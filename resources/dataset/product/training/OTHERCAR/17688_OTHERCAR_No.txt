            I own Saturn SL1 and I love it!  I had test drove one about a year before I bought this one and fell in love with them.  If you are a little on the short side (and I am!) this car fits great!  The seatbelt does not come across my face like it does in most cars, it fits comfortably at my shoulder.  I am 5'2&quot; and have never found a car that seemed to be made for me.  

This car also is a great car for a great price.  While my car was purchased used, it is in excellent shape and I haven't had any major problems with it after 4 years of ownership.  It drives and handles very nicely and rides like a dream.  It also has a sporty feel to it without being a sports car.  Which is great for a mother of two very young children.  

There are also lots of safety features that add to it's overall quality.  At the time that I purchased this car I had a 1989 Oldsmobile, my Saturn is a 1994 and buying it caused my insurance to DROP instead of going up!!  Imagine, a newer car with cheaper insurance!  That's a great deal!! <br><br>
