            A few months ago I decided to purchase a digital camera.  Mainly I wanted a digital for its ease in publishing images on the Internet through either the web or over email.  Even though I knew I could get a lot more for my money with a film camera, I also knew that a digital would fit my lifestyle better.  I knew from the past that I had major difficulties with getting my film developed�I was just too busy.  Plus, I always wanted to email friends and relatives but didn�t want to trouble myself with setting up the digital scanner.  Finally, being a poor photographer, I loved the idea of deleting bad pictures immediately after I took them.

Ideally I wanted something that had great image quality, great features for a novice photographer, simple usability, and an easy way to publish my images through my home computer.  Well, after several weeks of researching the latest and greatest, I was ready to make a purchase, and I went with the Casio QV-2000UX.

I found that the 2000UX had the best image quality out of all cameras in its class.  Granted I don�t have a professional eye for detail, but I found some of the other hot contenders a bit flaky in this area.  The pictures from the Kodak DC-280, for an example, seemed tinted orange, especially when photographing people.  Plus, the pictures from the Kodak cameras in general seemed distorted.  The other cameras that gave similar image quality, like the Canon S10, lacked in other areas. Not only did the 2000UX have clear, crisp images with well-balanced color, but it performed great in other areas as well.

Another important thing for me was the feature set.  I wanted a camera that was easy to use but that also gave me tons of things to play with.  The Casio won me over here, too.  First of all, this is a point and click camera on the surface.  Minutes after I pulled it out of the box, I was taking great pictures without even reading the instructions.  But, it also had tons of features to future experiments.  The 3x Optical Zoom along with the 2x Digital Zoom gave me 6x Zoom to play with.  Other cameras with notable picture quality only had 2x Optical Zoom.  The Casio also supported USB which allowed very speedy downloads.  Aperture and shutter speeds were both customizable, as well as color saturation and image settings.  And the 2000UX has other interesting features like panoramic pictures, digital video (without sound), and support for micro drives.

Of course, as with all things, this camera isn�t perfect.  But I believe you get a lot more than you pay for.  First of all I consider the construction weak and awkward.  The shell doesn�t have the ergonomic feel as other cameras, and the panel covering the parallel and digital ports was very flimsy.  Second, the software that comes with the camera is very weak.  Basically it only helps you load your pictures from the camera to the computer.  It doesn�t help much with downsizing or image correction.  Finally, as others have mentioned, the camera sucks batteries quickly.  Although I have found that the flash is the main culprit, and with the flash off and rechargeable batteries, I�ve experienced decent battery life.
  
Overall I recommend this product to anyone looking for a easy to use camera, with excellent picture quality, interesting features, and a relatively good price.
