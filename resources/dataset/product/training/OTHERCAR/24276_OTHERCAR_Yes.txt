            We bought a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo used in 1998.  It had only 32,000 miles on it, and was in great shape.  My husband and I were talking about getting a new vehicle since both of our cars were getting old, but we had a problem.... he wanted a 4-wheel drive truck and I wanted a family 4-door vehicle.  We decided to compromise and look at SUV's.  I had my heart set on either a Jimmy or a Blazer.  When we started looking at vehicles we saw our Jeep on the lot at a dealership.  It was in such good condition and we knew we couldn't afford a new vehicle, so we decided to talk about the Jeep.  It is a decision that we haven't regretted yet.  My husband got his 4-wheel drive and I have my family vehicle.
We put running boards on the Jeep shortly after we bought the vehicle because I became pregnant with our first child.  I am a little short(5'4&quot;) so it comes in handy for me to use them when I put our daughter into her carseat. 
Because I am short I feel a little uncomfortable being so close to the steering wheel (where the airbag is stored) but hopefully I won't ever have the situation to have the thing go off, God willing.
The only drawback that I can see of this vehicle is the amount of gs it takes to fill up.....especially since the price of gas is so out of control right now.
We hope to have our Jeep for along time!!!!!!!<br><br>
