            For the past 3 years I've personally owned two infiniti QX4 vehicles.  I bought my first one in June of '97 and unfortunetly last summer I got in an accident which totaled the car.  After extensive negotiation with the insurance company I decided to once again buy a QX4, only this time the 99.5 version.  Though I currently own and love my QX4, I must be honest with you, there are some flaws to this luxury sport utility vehicle.  

First what I like:  The initial buying of my Qx4 was somewhat thoughtless, I was absolutely drawn to the aesthetic aspects of this car.  In my opinion the Qx4 looks much better than any other SUV vehicle I've seen.  In the first 2 months of having my car I must have been stared at a thousand times.  I mean this thing will get peoples attention.  The mere sight of it screams class, elegance, and above all luxury.  This is no regular SUV.  The inside of the Qx4 is phenomenol with only minor problems that can be avoided.  The leather is very smooth looking, and it doesn't wrinkle, or crack very easily.  The dash board is enveloped in wood trim, which only adds to the luxury effect of the overall vehicle.  The Bose audio system manages to block out the outside world, and envelops the passengers in a musical trance.  Every little sound is accented, and accounted for.  The drive is overall smooth, but I must say at times I feel the engine lacks overall power.  The safety of the vehicle, is in my eyes flawless.  After my accident I thought I was dead from the looks of the car.  And though the outside of the car was torn apart, the inside managed to hold strong, and protect me from any injuries.  The space in the trunk is not overly huge, but it works.  I play hockey so I have to keep my hockey bag and at least 3 sticks in the back of my car at all times.  The trunk easily accomodates my stuff, leaving extra room for minor things.  I must worn you though if you want a lot of room go to a different SUV.  

Now the flaws:  The most obvious problem in my opinion is that the car lacks overall power, this is because your asking a V6 engine to pull a whole lot of weight.  I also sense that at times when driving on the highway at speeds over 75 mph, the car rattles a little making the ride a little more noticeable than usual.  The back seats do lack extra space for larger adults, but they easily accomodate kids.  

My view of the Qx4 is very positive but I don't want people to be fooled into buying one.  Be cautious and weigh exactly what you are looking for in a SUV.  If you demand luxury, above average performance, and aestheic beauty the QX4 is for you.  If you want a rugged, larger car that can accomodate more people, and more luggage I would suggest the likes of a Lexus LX470, Cadillac Escalade, or Mitsubishi Montero.  The Qx4 is great for a husband and wife, or even a single person.  <br><br>
