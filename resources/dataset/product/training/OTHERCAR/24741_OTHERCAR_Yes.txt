            I first looked at this camera for no other reason than it was a Sony.
To say I have great faith in Sony products is an understatement and, too date, I have never had a problem with any Sony equipment.
The next thing that took my eye was that it was 3.3 megapixel.  At the time, this level of resolution had only just become available so it was a big deal to be able to buy one.
Having reviewed the competition (again at the time) I selected the Sony CyberShot DSC-S70 Digital Camera, purchased it and proceeded to play.

I was annoyed to discover it was supplied with only 8megs in memory stick as this wouldn't allow a single TIFF image to be stored.  So, I continued to play with Jpeg images.

I found out that in order to output a print of OK quality, the resolution needed was no less than 1280x960. I now have a better range of memory sticks and take all my shots at the maximum 2048x1536.  I prefer quality so don't mind the size particularly when I can get a decent 12" x 18" print as a result.

The shape of the camera annoys me as it is a little to thick and bulky.  Having the lens biased to the left also throws of the balance a bit but it is a minor thing I guess.

I've had many hours of fun with this product.  It is nice to see Sony building on the theme with the DSC S85.  I'd like to get my hands on one of those but, not on this pay cheque.
