            The 1999 Oldsmobile Alero is poised to help Olds continue its comeback partly by doing the tough job of attracting people oriented toward import cars. Many Americans don't include any U.S. automaker on their shopping lists because they assume domestic autos possess mediocre designs and marginal quality many such cars had in the 1980s and early 1990s. The power steering is precise, but the brake pedal has a firm feel that takes getting used to when modulating brakes during fast stops. The Alero definitely is a contender. But Olds now must lure potential buyers to showrooms to try out the car.
