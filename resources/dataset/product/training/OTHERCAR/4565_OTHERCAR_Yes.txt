            I purchased my Prizm in late 1997. Since then it has seen plenty of the country. I have driven it between GA and FL (400 mile round trip) several times, from FL to TX then to WA, made many many 400+ mile trips while in WA, and back to TX in it with no problems.  

I have a stripped down model (manual transmission, power nothing, am/fm radio) but have no major complaints with it. The main complaint I have is that I can't have tether anchors installed for child safety seats in it as Geo's have no anchorage areas for them. For people with children in safety seats, I have fit 3 seats in the back seat (2 convertibles and an infant seat and 2 infant seats and a convertible).

I accidentally broke my antenna shortly after purchasing it due to forgetting I had a somewhat flimsy one instead of the sturdy one I had on my prior car. When washing in a car wash remember to put the antenna down LOL. I discovered afterwards that I would have to purchase the part from the dealer and have it professionally installed due to how complicated replacement is.

As far as repairs go, I have only had to have the starter replaced. I currently have 150,000 miles on it and am planning on trading it in (not due to the car itself but I want something different).
