            When I decided to buy a digital camera, I thought of cumbersome cables and computer connections and I shied away from even looking for one for a while. I then saw a friend's Sony which used floppy discs. The quality of the pictures she sent to me was unbelievable and I decided to check out what Sony -- and other manufacturers -- had to offer. I looked at several brand and admittedly was confused. What kind of zoom did I need? Did I want a compact light camera or a bigger, more functional one? Did I want a little cheap thing or did I want to invest in a camera that would take me through the next few years?

At last I looked at The Sony. It takes up to 12 photos on one floppy but also has a memory so that you can make a back up of your recently shot photos which I found to be extremely handy. Floppies are NOT indestructible and a back up is always a good thing. You can take videos on this camera with sound and they are as sharp and clear as anything I have seen on the net.

The camera is not the easiest one in the world to operate but reading the manual through will give you everything you need to know to start taking great photos. I started at a very important wrestling event which was poorly lit and fast moving. I had only one problem and that is when you push the button to take a photo, there is a slight delay before the photo is taken which can be a hindrance taking action shots.

However, the preview feature shows you immediately what your photo looks like and if you don't like it, you can delete it and not wait until you get home and get the photos developed to see you missed an important shot. That is my FAVORITE feature of this camera. You see exactly what you get and you know immediately if you need to retake a photo. No surprises at the film counter!!

The flash is ready for low light situations and I had no problems learning (FAST) how to use the camera and the quality was good enough to sell to major magazines. 

The one drawback besides the relatively show shutter response is the weight. After a full day of hauling the camera around, I was fatigued. It is a fairly heavy piece of equipment but the neck strap helps to distribute the weight. The battery lasts a LONG time but a second one is recommended for anyone who doesn't have access to a charger and electricity (and time) to recharge in between shooting. I was able to get magazine quality shots from a distance as well as up close and they print out flawlessly.

I have very little negative to say about the purchase and I feel that I definitely made the right choice in picking this Sony and a camera that takes floppies rather than relies on memory chips and cables. I am a low tech woman and sliding a floppy into the drive is worlds easier than uploading photos with cables!!

Ease of use, quality, and features are the key factors to this camera.

*** I just wanted to note that I recently used the camera and managed to get 22 pictures on one floppy disk with excellent quality. I was able, also, to get three 5 seconds videos and 14 pictures on another disk. So, my prior statement that you can get 12 photos waas misleading. Depending on the dpi you set (I was using 300 dpi the first time for magazine and print quality), you can get up to 25 or more photos on one disk. This past time, the photos were taken at the standard 72 dpi for webs browsing and the quality is remarkable. October 24, 2000.
