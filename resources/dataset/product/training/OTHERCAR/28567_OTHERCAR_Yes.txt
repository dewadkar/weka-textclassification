            	I learned to drive in a manual-transmission Jeep Wrangler.  The Wrangler proved an excellent vehicle to learn to drive a stick �shift in because of its low gearing in 4-Low and because of it�s forgiving clutch.  I gave that transmission a rough time � I ground the gears, I spun the tires, but the little Jeep held up admirably.
	When my friends and I became old enough to drive the Jeep without parents, we put it through real trials and tribulations.  We did some serious off-roading, driving through creeks and into gullies.  We floored the accelerator through deep mud and slammed the brakes in the sand.  We jumped over bumps and ran into trees.  The Wrangler drove on, seemingly unperturbed.
	It takes on all types of terrain as well as any reasonably priced sport utility.  In addition, the Wrangler�s tight turning radius makes it easy to turn around if you get in terrain that looks too rough. Limited slip rear differentials are also available.  Weight distribution in the Wrangler is wonderful � you can tackle obstacles in 2wd that would require 4wd of a larger vehicle.  Yet if 4wd is needed, Jeep offers several high-tech computerized 4wd systems, like Selec-Trac.  These full-time systems allow power to go to the wheel with the most traction, and can be used on dry pavement.  They are recommended for climates where snow is a factor in winter driving.  If you don�t need a high-tech 4wd system, Jeep offers the more traditional part-time Command-Trac. Either way, the low curb weight, durability, excellent weight distribution, and tight turning radius combine with the Wrangler�s low price to make Jeep Wrangler the best off-road vehicle for the money.
	A friend of mine, Justin Wilson (theJuiceJW), eventually bought a Jeep Wrangler for on-road use.  His is a 1997 model.  In 1997, Jeep redesigned the chassis of the Wrangler.  They turned it from a sport utility with a slight rollover problem into one of the safest sport utility vehicles on the road � bar none!  The safety downfall of nearly every sport utility vehicle is a tendency to roll over � not so with the 97-up Jeep Wrangler.  The Wrangler has been mentioned in several product liability lawsuits as a vehicle built the way a sport ute should be � a vehicle that, under normal driving conditions, will not roll over.
	The Jeep Wrangler performs adequately on the road.  It handles well for a sport ute, and acceleration is excellent with the efficient 4.0 liter V-6 engine (though power is lacking with smaller engines).  The Wrangler�s small size and short wheelbase make for a tight turning radius, which translates into easy parking in tight places The short wheelbase, however, also makes highway driving rougher than it would be in a larger vehicle.
	There is, obviously, precious little room inside the Wrangler.  Storage space is limited, and rear seat passengers are cramped.  Yet one doesn�t purchase a Wrangler if he needs the interior room of an Excursion.  The Jeep Wrangler fills its own market niche perfectly � it is a capable yet inexpensive sport utility vehicle that is simply fun to drive on asphalt and on dirt.<br><br>
