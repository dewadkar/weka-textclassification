            I have a '97 4 cyl. Jeep Wrangler, and I love it- there are, however, a few things you should know before buying a Jeep. I am basing all of this info on a soft top, so if you have hard top, this may not apply to you.

1. VERY LOUD! I would recommend buying a soundbar (if you can afford Jeep's  ridiculously pricey options.)

2. Difficult to control when windy- imagine driving a sailboat down the highway...

3. Leaks- can't get the top to stop leaking- has created mildew on carpets and unpleasant smell after it rains...Does anyone know how to get rid of carpet mildew???? ANYONE?????

4. Plastic windows scratch very easily. The dealer told me to clean them w/ water only, and not to use soap, which I have done- but the windows always look dirty and are VERY Scratched- am constantly amazed when I see Jeeps w/ clear soft tops...

5. After the novelty wears off, top is a PAIN to put back on again... if you are test driving one of these, take off the top and put it back on a few times- Now try doing it yourself... Now try doing it yourself when it is pouring rain!

6. Don't get a detachable face stereo- buy a "breakaway" model - everytime I went over a bump when off-roading, the face of my cassette player would fly off. Happened w/ 3 detachable face players-

7. Don't get a cd player- they'll skip when you're off-road, you DON'T want to leave cd's in a wrangler (or anything else you can't easily or relatively inexpensively replace)

I DONT WANT TO DISCOURAGE anyone from buying this car- I love my Jeep, even w/ the hassles- I just think you should know what you're getting that the dealer won't tell you about.
On the plus side, the car handles wonderfully- I have been able to maneuver the Jeep into the tightest possible parking spaces, and U-turns have never been so simple. I have also driven this car from Massachusetts to Florida 8 times, and it always worked well for me. It did, however make me wish I had opted for air-conditioning! I decided not to get the air installed because when it was that hot, I would have the top down. Making the MA-FL trek, however, the car was loaded up with my belongings going to and from college, and I could not safely have the top off, and did not want to have the hassle of putting it on again when I reached the hotel I would stop at each night. It is a very fun car to drive, and has been extremely reliable.
