                Among some of the cars that I have driven, the 1998 Mercedes E 430 stands out in my mind as one of the most exceptional.  It has a look that is all its own, there is no other car on the market that looks anything like it, and thats a good thing!  One of its most distinguishing features are the dual circular headlights which are not only fashionalbe, but also very efficient.  The body of the car is quite stunning, and the hood ornament is clearly visible from the driver seat, perpetually reassuring you that you are driving something special.  The interior of the car is quite stylish with its leather and dark mahogony accents.  Among some of this cars special features is power everything, one touch windows, up and down, seat settings that can be memorized for up to three different drivers, and a "WB" (weather band) button that can be pressed anytime to get the weather and traffic anywhere in the nation you may be.  This car of course comes with the Mercedes' ESP (electronic skid protection) to help keep the car under control when things get a little sticky.  Now onto my favorite, engine and performance...

     In 1998, there were three models of the E class offered.  The first, a 3.0L 225hp 6cyl diesel engine, the second was a 3.2L 225hp 6cyl, and then the 4.3L 275hp V8.  However, starting in 2000, the E class also comes with an optional 5.5L 349hp V8 (the E55 AMG).  My experience is with the E 430, which believe me, is plenty fast.  Im not sure that the reviews that are written in magazines such as Road and Track, or Car and Driver are quite accurate when they talk about performance. This car is dangerously fast. The 0 to 60 is listed in just about 6 seconds, however, on three consecutive occasions, I raced, and beat the infamous GT Mustang, (all manuals) which have a 0 to 60 time listed at 5.3 seconds.  Is this possible? Well, I dont know, but this car has all the speed you need.  The best part is that at any speed, the car has a very solid feel, it really hugs the road, and doesnt let go.  It is electronically limited at 131mph, but will reach speeds in excess of 150mph.  It comes standard with 16" rims with Michelin tires, which hold up extremely well.  This really is one of the very luxury sport cars.
