            Now this is a vehicle that looks to be promising, but has a
history of problems over the years.  The older, the worse.
I haven't driven the new ones, but if you are going to buy a
used one, make SURE you have someone who knows what they are
doing to check into the transmission!  They have a problem
with the gears shearing off inside the transmission pan
creating an unstable transmission.  The shards of metal
accumulate in the pan and before you know it, the gears will
refuse to engage properly one day, but work fine the next.

I must however give them kudos on one thing:  security!

Blazers hold up well when someone is trying to break in to
them!  However, if you don't have insurance, a thief can do
a lot of costly damage attempting to run off with this vehicle!
Luckily many are equipped with anti-theft systems that will
deter some criminals.

However if you can't drive it because the transmission isn't
functioning properly then you hardly need to worry about thieves
running off with it anyway.  Just be sure to have rental
reimbursement and theft/vandal protection before purchasing 
one!<br><br>
