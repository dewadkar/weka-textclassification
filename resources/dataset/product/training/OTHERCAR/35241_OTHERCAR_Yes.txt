            i love my isuzu trooper. I've had it about 6 years and its been one of the most reliable vehicles i have ever owned. before the trooper, my other vehicles were all ford or general motors and i drive a lot so i put a lot of miles on them. they just did not hold up like my trooper. i did have to do normal upkeep such as tires and oil and stuff, but even then i have only had to replace tires one time and brakes one time in over 132000 miles. i did have to repair the transmission, but that was not that much and other than that it is easy to take care of and very roomy. theres room for all my stuff when we go camping and out of town. i have kids and theres room for all their friends. it handles well too. i was scared by some tv thing i saw, but have never had a problem driving or controlling my vehicle. <br><br>
