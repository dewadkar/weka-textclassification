                <b>O</b>ne of the last few traditional American styled big luxury sedans, the Lincoln Town Car continues to be a consistent top seller, thanks to its huge list of standard equipment, competitive pricing, and outstanding attention to interior detail and good value. The only major problem with this car is the fact that it holds its resale value about as well as an opened bottle of fine wine.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>  

    <b>Once upon a time</b> most full sized cars were like the 1999 Town Car, today however there are few traditional-style, full sized choices, Cadillac, perhaps the Q45 can also boast such a traditional claim. A truly huge interior welcomes you, allowing the driver and passengers to stretch out in total comfort whether they be in the front or back seats. Thanks to the smooth ride, this stretching can be accomplished at any speed. At high speeds the Town Car is whisper quiet, and for a 4,000 lb car, it handles as well as can be expected, which is good, but like most big cars twistys roads are not accomplished with high speed ease. The '99 Town car comes with a SOHC 4.6 liter engine producing 220hp and 290lb-ft of torque, not too impressive, but it does enable this heavy weight to get from 0-60 in a shade less than 8 seconds (according to specs). This 4.6 liter V8 is silky smooth compared to the older OHV 5.0s the Town cars were once equipped with in the 1980s-early '90s. The Town Car's V8 is coupled with an equally silky smooth 4-speed automatic.


<i>About this engine:</i>
    
    <b>S</b>ince 1991, all Town Car's have been powered by Ford's Modular 4.6 liter (281-cubic inch) single overhead cam V8.
This smooth, silky V8 has Fords's EEC-V processor that controls the sequential multipoint electronic fuel injection, electronic voltage regulator, mandatory on board diagnostics II programing, and a distributorless ignition. And to think, you always thought the town car was a dinosaur when it came to technology. The engine is offered in two states of tune, a 205 hp or a 220 hp which offers  faster acceleration. 205 hp sounds like hardly nothing for a car that weighs this much, but torque remains around 290 lb-ft, so its not as bad as it sounds.

  Since 1980, the Town Car has been built off the body-on- frame Panther platform (shared with the Crown Victoria and the Grand Marquis). <b>S</b>uspension is of the old school, independent front, live rear axle, but the Town Car benefits from a watt linkage and air springs at the rear. This gives it surprising stability for such a large car. There are also gas filled shocks, traction Control, and standard anti lock brakes.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

    The <b>interior</b> of the Town car, like I said before, is "huge". It's one of the largest luxury cars I have ever driven. The leather is excellent, the seats; very supportive and comfortable. Changes for 1999 include revised wood appliques and storage space in the arm rest. The steering wheel fits your hand like a glove, and all the controls are right there on the steering wheel to give you easy access to all your amenities. Speaking of amenities, there are tons! A beautiful sounding sound system, power everything, climate control, and like the Infiniti Q45, there is an analog clock right above the stereo. The 1999 Lincoln Town car has front and side air bags, there are designed to provide incremental head and chest protection. inflation time is upon impact is 30 milli-seconds!


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>  

       The <b>exterior</b> says 'class and Luxury' more than any American car I have seen. If these cars were more rare it would definitely prove to be more of an eye catcher. A traditional Lincoln grille, a bold, rich looking body, and a little Cartier badge that says "this is the top of the line Lincoln." The Town Car is the most traditional and luxurious vehicle in the Lincoln line-up. Customers undoubtedly agree because this fabulous four door is the company's best seller hands down.

     Offered in executive, signature, and Cartier editions, the Town Car is a tremendous luxury buy. To get the most out of your money buy a 1999 Cartier Edition with the 'touring package'. which adds a stiff suspension, and an extra 15 hp, 15 hp may not sound like much, but trust me, you can feel all the extra 15 horses.
