            The two biggest flaws I found in the Odyssey were leg room and minispare.

First off, I'm 5'11&quot;. I fit just fine in the driver's seat, but when in the passenger seat, my left leg hits the dash. Honda has a strangly-designed dash that comes down straighter rather than swept toward the engine. Make sure you look carefully at this and compare it to the van with the most leg room for me: the Grand Voyager.

Also, I cannot believe that Honda would put in a stupid little minispare tire instead of a fullsize. You cannot fit a fullsize tire in the compartment that holds the minispare. When Honda designed the rear seat to fold into a bucket, they had to find another place for the spare, which they put in behind the front seats in a very hard-to-reach spot. You'll see in most other vans, the spare tire is tucked up under the van at the rear. So if you're on a trip in your van and you get a flat tire, your minispare won't get you home! 

Maybe Honda feels like the inconvenience is minor compared to how often you have to change a tire, but I had to do this in January on my van. I was 50 miles from home, on a Sunday, and it was raining. I would've had a hard time making that drive back with a minispare and limited to 35mph.

Other CONS:
--Stereo is lame.
--Middle seat is hard to move from bucket to bench. What about making this a simple sliding operation?
--No cross rails? what gives?
--Price and availability (wait a few months)


The PROS:
Honda does make a smooth ride with a tight turning radius. The acceleration and braking are both smooth and crisp. The American-made vans feel sluggish and often have the suspension of a truck rather than a car. 

The new cam design supposedly gives better traction at low speeds, but I don't know enough about it to support it's claim.

Honda has a proven reliability record.
