            I test drove the Bravada for GM last weekend and found some good points and some bad points.  Lets go over them step by step to show you what I mean:

Good points: 

     1.  Very comfortable ride.  Vehicle has very low road noise and is very smooth on the highway.  Also in off road situations you still have comfort.
     2.  Great sound system.  With the Bose sound it really feels like you are live when listening to a CD.
     3.  Good heating system.  With automatic climate control you can set your temperature and forget about it.  It takes care of everything to make sure you are comfortable.
     4.  Plenty of storage.  The back hatch and storage area is spacious, allowing you to haul most anything you want.  The back seats lay down for additional space and there are tie down rings in the back.  Also it comes with a rack on top for more storage space.

Bad Points:

     1.  Too small of an engine.  The vehicle comes with their 4300 Vortec V-6 engine.  I found it to be less than adequate for acceleration.  It causes the transmission to work harder than it should.  This may cause transmission problems in the future.
     2.  Poor rear seating.  This vehicle is not made for the family of four.  With 2 average size adults in the front the rear seating is cramped, even for children.  I have a very petite 14 yr old daughter and a 6 yr old son,  They both complained about leg room.
     3.  The CD player runs too hot.  When I removed a CD from the player it comes out so hot it was difficult to handle.  This tells me there are problems.  I recommended to GM to have this unit repaired.  Not a good sign for a brand new vehicle.

Conclussion:  This rig has many good features and rides great.  However with the problems I found I feel that GM needs to make some modifications, like a bigger engine and more leg room for rear passengers.
