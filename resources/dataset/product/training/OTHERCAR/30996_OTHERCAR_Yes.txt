            This bulky sports car can do 0-60 in under6 seconds and weighs over 3500 pounds.  Thats pretty impressive, coming out of twin turbo v6 engine.  Quite comfortable on the inside.  And a great looking exterior.  People usually buy cars because of thier after market potential (IE wings/spoilers, front air dams, rims, light covers, body kits.  And this car is probably the most versatile on top of its near 300hp engine.  It makes for one of the most desirable cars in the market today.  I really dont understand why they discontinued it.  I payed $23,000 and it was worth every penny, The current aftermarket accessories i currently have on it are.  OZ 5 point rims, Body kit, low profile racing tires, lowered 3 inches. I recommend this car to anyone who has the money to spend on it.<br><br>
