            Now that I've owned my 2003 Accord Coupe EX-V6 for 12 months, I feel a review of the automobile would be useful. 

Bottom Line:

My overall impression of the car is that it's 1) Solid 2) Well executed 3) Reasonably sporty 4) Reasonably luxurious and 5) a great buy in the 25k near luxury segment of automobiles. 

Problems:

In the 12 months of owning this car, the only problem I've encountered was a jammed CD changer / head unit that had to be replaced at one and a half months. I'm actually kind of worried that this might happen again once the warranty period ends as the part goes for well over 1,000 dollars!! Other than that, the car has been problem free.

Gripes:

Minor:  After seeing pics of the Mazda 6 and the new 20004 Solara Coupe, my only criticism is that some of interior materials could have been of higher quality. For example, the piece of clear plastic that covers the base of the automatic transmission shifter now has a small crack which strikes me as a bit cheap. I would have also appreciated more of the brushed aluminum to break up the monotony of the plastic dash. Don't get me wrong, it's still a very upscale interior and the fit and finish is still first rate. 

Raves:

Amazing seats. Some of the most comfortable and supportive I've come across. I didn't really appreciate how important good seats were to the overall driving experience until I purchased the car. The suspension and handling characteristics, although not the most sporty, has a nice balance of road feel and comfort. The dual climate zone controls and heated seats is something you usually don't see in this price segment and well appreciated by me and my fiance :) The overall layout for most of the switches is really faultless. The 6 airbags, combined with the 5 star driver, passenger, and side impact crash scores really impressed my parents (always a good thing). The 240 Horsepower DOHC VTEC engine is an engineering marvel! I was able to drive to San Francisco from Los Angeles on one tank of gas, averaging 29 miles per gallon and 70-75 MPH on the 5 freeway. Add it all up and you have a winner. It's a Honda. Can you really go wrong?

SIDENOTE: Although the seats are exceptionally supportive and comfortable, the leather seats NEED to be maintained. The leather is above average in grade but definitely not as resistent to drying out as leather found in a Lexus or Mercedes.  I've been pretty consistent with regular leather conditioning (using both Meguiars Gold Class leather Rich Leather Foam Cleaner & Conditioner, as well as Turtle Wax Leather Cleaner & Conditioner Spray Bottle) for the front two seats and a little less consistent with the rear seats. After a year of ownership, there is a clear difference in suppleness between the front seats and the rear seats. I am now playing catch-up to restore the moisture content of the rear seats. I suspect the black leather in my coupe will be more susceptible to drying out than lighter colored leather so individual experiences may vary. In any event, it doesn't hurt to pamper your seats so be sure to invest in a $6 dollar bottle of leather  cleaner/conditioner.
