            We just purchased a 1998 V70 about 2 weeks ago. It had 47,300 miles on it so it has about 2700 more for factory warranty and then it has an additional 2 years/24,000 beyond that. Before this we had a 1989 Volvo 740 Turbo (talk about problems!!). We have 3 kids (7,3,5 months) and my wife's only stipulation when we traded was that the back seat not be smaller than the 740's.

Like I have read here, there were a few small things that the dealer has agreed to do...1) Replace the door panels as they have pulled away from themselves, 2) Install 3rd seat (Dealer pays for this, I negotiioated for this in the trade), 3) Install booster seat (Dealer pays for this. I negotiated for this also), 4) Fix electric door lock on rear passenger side door. It will not unlock. At all.

So far we really like it. I commute about 45min-1hr/day and the ride is smooth and quiet. Sometimes I hardly realize the car is shifting gears. The seats are a joy (leather). It is, however, probably too early to tell about reliability. I will keep you all informed.<br><br>
