            Buying:
I replaced my 1996 VW Jetta with the Sport LX version of the 2003 Civic 4 door(Canada). The buying experience was not a great one, as cars seem to have become a commodity sale these days. We visited various Honda dealers in the area with varying results. Unfortunately there rarely seem to be any great price-breaks to be had with this car, I think there is simply a mentality of demand=high price here in Montreal at least. We settled roughly on a price of 23,000$ (Canadian) and avoided the extra warranty et all, and not without hearing the dealers scare tactics.

The Car:
The car in question is the 2003 Civic LX Sport in silver. Essentially it's a standard LX model plus a package that included the moonroof, leather bound steering wheel, rear-spoiler, ABS brakes heated mirrors and aluminum wheels as options. Our LX is automatic with air conditioning as well.

First Thoughts:
I immediately noticed that the quality of construction was a lot better than my 96 Jetta was, also that they seats are reasonably comfortable and the interior is ergonomic if low-key. Power is definately seriously lacking in the automatic but the feel and handling is pretty responsive.

Overall:
We have had the car now for 7 months and we are both rather happy. 

Performance:
I still have to complain about the poor acceleration and power in the automatic, and also on the engine noise. Now it's not the noise level that I dislike as much as the lawnmower sort of sound that it makes. It just could sound more like a car than a motorcycle if you ask me. This is to some extent an adjustment for me, coming from having a VW 2.0 litre manual, there is a lot more torque in that engine, while the Honda takes some more pedal pressure to get you going. 

Handling/Braking:
Love the ABS brakes, handling is responsive and has a clean feel.

Quality/Comfort:
We are very satisfied with the quality of construction, everything feels solid and well made. The seats are also very comfortable, even after hours of highway driving. I am six foot one, and I have no problems sitting in front or back, very good headroom, even with the moon-roof. The CD radio has great sound, and is easy to use. Cupholders are large, the charcoal graphite trim and speedometer are nice.

Look/Design/Space:
I enjoy the look. The addition of a chrome band on the front grille adds a certain elegance, The spoiler is a nice touch to make the car less "family looking", though it is a bit high for my tastes, could have been a little more low-profile. Another negative for me is the silver painted bumpers scratch/damage easily and show black underneath. If you live in an urban area and do a lot of parallel parking you will probably get a lot of marking. There is a lot of space in this car, the trunk is a good size, though it would be nice if the remote could open the trunk as well as the doors.

Fuel Consumption:
Seems to be pretty good considering it's automatic, the tank is a little small though, so more fillups.
