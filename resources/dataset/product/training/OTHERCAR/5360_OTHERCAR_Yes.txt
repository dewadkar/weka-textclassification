            I have owned my 1995 318ic for almost three years, and I must say that it has been a joyous tenure.  I purchased the automobile used (from a lease auction), and was somewhat concerned about it's reliability.  None of my concerns have been realized.  It is the first BMW that I have owned, and I think I will be buying BMWs for the rest of my life.  

Although it is only an '18, the car has juice.  The car accelerates nicely from stop, and in motion.  The suspension is crisp and refreshingly rigid.  All in all, the ride is great.  

One of the main drawbacks is the expensive factory maintenance.  If you go to the dealer, you will spend at least $700 every 15,000 miles.  However, I have discovered that there are many independent shops that charge much less (at least 50%) than the dealer's service departments, and are very qualified.
