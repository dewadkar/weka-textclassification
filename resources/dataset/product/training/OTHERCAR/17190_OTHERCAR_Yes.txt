            When my wife and I recently went hunting for a new car we really had no intention at all at looking at the Maxima.  However, a wonderful opportunity fell in our collective lap and we took advantage of it, and we are extremely happy that we did just that.  We got our 1997 Nissan Maxima SE, with just over 40,000 miles on it, right at about $14,500.  Now, that amount of money may seem to be a little high for a 1997 model car, but let me tell you, it was well worth every penny.  Neither my wife nor myself have ever been happier with a car.  

My favorite thing about the car has to be the engine.  Nissan has not changed this engine since 1995 because they knew they had something special when they first implemented it.  In fact, Car & Driver magazine listed it as one of the top overall engines of all time.  That is certainly saying something considering all thee engines that have ever been built. This engine provides very quick acceleration, speed, is extremely quite, and very reliable - which I especially like.  My wife, on the other hand, is of course not too concerned with the details of the engine.  Her favorite features are the sleek look and comfortable ride.  I will have to admit, you hardly ever feel a bad bump anymore.     

Overall, I am very happy with our Maxima.  I don't think that I could have gotten a better car for a better price than what I got here.  I have been extremely happy with it since our purchase even while trying to find something wrong with it because I'm a natural skeptic.  Needless to say, there has not been one thing I've found that I didn't like about this car - from bumper to bumper.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a quality used car, whether you are looking for a family sedan or a fun-mobile.  This car will meet all your needs.
