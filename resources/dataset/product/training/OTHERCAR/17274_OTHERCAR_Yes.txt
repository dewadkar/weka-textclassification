                 Hating to give into, the status of &quot;family car&quot;, yet needing more room, we woefully, wandered through the car lots, contemplating trading in our sleek , sharp Chrysler Sebring.  I drug my feet, upon first impression of the Intrepid.  It was 'all right', yet it just didn't have that 'cutesy' image our sebring had.  Finally, upon taking a test drive , I began to realize how much power I had been missing.  The intrepid packs an incredible punch!  When needing to pass someone , you PASS someone, there's no sluggish , gradual acceleration.  
     Needless to say , we now own this car, and love it!  Our family vacations have been so great , with all the room the interior of the Intrepid offers--Leg room, head room, room to breathe!  
     Giving up the cute look of the two door , was well worth the trade off , in all we have gained with the intepid.  Yes, I still miss the sebring, but then I punch the accelerator of the intrepid and sit back for the ride!<br><br>
