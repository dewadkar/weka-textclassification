            The Sony Mavica FD83 is a wonderful camera for ANYONE - beginner to pro!
I bought my Mavica over a year ago and was completely clueless to digital cameras. It has been a great camera to begin and learn on- it's so simple.

Thiscamera comes with an in depth manual that is very easy to read and understand. It comes with a nice carrying case . It comes with a &quot;Infolithium&quot; battery pack that holds a full 210 minute charge. Also included with the camera is the charger. 

The Mavica FD83 has many features such as; date and time, option to record still or moving pictures, auto or manual focus,and picture effects.
You can select picture quality and size. It offers different playback modes to view your pictures right on the camera. You can even erase a picture you take if you don't like it. 

One of the best thing about this camera is it takes 2Hd floppy disks. You can take your pictures and insert them right in your computer. It's that easy!

The camera surface is easily cleaned with a damp cloth. The screen surface as with any must be cleaned with a LCD cleaning kit.

This camera was an excellent investment. I have had no problems at all with it and would recommend it to anyone!
