            I don't have have the '91 cutlass ciera...but, I have the 1989 oldsmobile cutlass ciera. Ok, I owned this car for the last two years, since I was 16 and this is a very good first starter car for the teenager who's just got their driver's license like I did. The radio is stereo and it has an cassette player(but you can put in a new model radio with cd player if you want to), it's a 6 cyclinder(drinks a whole lot of gas, but not that much like a 8 cyclinder and up). This is a very good car for the price. At least it takes you from point A to point B.

The car exterior and interior color is maroon and it doesn't have any scratches to the exterior paint. It has a luggage carrier on the back. This is a good car for executives, teenagers, a good highway car, and a car that takes you from point A to point B. It doesn't waste that much gas if you fill the gas tank with $20. It's fast, powerful, and I only paid $2,270 for this car two yrs ago.

<b>Pros</b>

Good car for the first teenage driver.
Radio sounds good and it's stereo.
Has a cassette player but you can put in a cd player if you want to.
Doesn't waste that much gas if you fill up the tank, and don't drive it all over.
Fast and powerful.
Takes you from point A to point B.

Now onto the cons:

<b>Cons</b>

Driving axisle and cv boost is going out.
Brake hose has a crack in it(That's due to the idiots that changed the driver side's brake hose, but didn't change the passenger's side). 
Doors doesn't open from the inside, so you have to roll down the window and open the door from the outside.

Other than those three cons, and as soon as I find a job, this would be a pretty good car for me. Everyone in my family says so. And as soon as I get the car fixed, it would make a very good highway car because it drive smooth and it's fast. I'm sorry if this review is limited as it is, but I'd updated it when I do get a chance.
