            Seeing that I could use a car that can do 0-60 in about 5.7 seconds the GS400 caught my attention for many reasons.  On is the contour shape of the vehicle.  Another would the fact that has 300 horses under the hood.  I was skepticle at first but I decided to try it out.  I love the way this car handles and the way you can beat just about any other luxury car on the street.  Lexus has always been the first in line when it comes to sporty luxury cars and this one is no exception.  Sure you might want to buy a BMW or Mercedes but for a little less money you can buy a car that comes to the same performance and luxury.  What I love about this car is the neon blue lights that come with this vehicle.  I also love the GPS system.  It's touch activated so just type in the address and it will tell you what you have to do and where you have to turn.  Not to mention this car comes with a six disk CD changer and a monster of a speaker system.  For a little more money you can get the GOLD PACKAGE or you could get the LEXUS PLATINUM PACKAGE.  But you have to pay a little bit more.  When it comes to driving this vehicle you better put your foot down slow or your in for a shock.  The power of this vehicle is so great that it will push you back in your seat and you'll probably break that back tires loose.  You would want to buy this vehicle if you have a family of three or four.  Also this car would be great for a newly grad who is looking for a car that has power and luxury at the same time.  So all in all the GS400 is the perfect car to buy<br><br>
