            -Very nice interior layout. Intuitive to new drivers. 

-This is the only pickup I've ever had that actually had a reasonably comfortable back seat. I've been on many family vacations (1500 miles) in the back and didn't mind it at all. If it's a bit tight, at least the padding is comfortable. The front seats, even in the middle are very luxurious. Chrysler uses nice cloth material.

-The styling, especially with the sport package is very pleasing on the eyes. I routinely get complimented by fellow drivers. 

-This V10 can pass anything but a gas station. 10mpg is the average. How did this thing escape the gas guzzler tax? At LEAST it uses regular and not premium. 35 gallons too, takes a while to fill it up. Averages $50 for a tankful of gas in Delaware.

-Routine squeaks and rattles in the suspension drive me crazy. The dealer fixes them, only a week later to have returned.

-This truck is hard to park in tight areas. It has a very large turning radius, and is a very wide vehicle.
