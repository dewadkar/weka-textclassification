            I brought my car to the shop yesterday morning because it was driving rough.  So i asked them to give me an oil change and service my transmission.  I brought my car in at nine in the morning and at 3:30 i got a call from Robersons.  They called to tell me i blew a headgasket, i need bran new brakes in the front and i needed a full tune up!  I bought my car a little over a year ago.  Yes it was used but its only a 97.  My car has 40,000 miles on it.  I have to spend $1350 to get my car totally repaired.  Luckily i bought extended waranty which will cover half that.  It seems to me like when the car thinks the warranty is up it will totally fall apart.  I was so upset to think about 8 days before christmas i have to put this much money into my car thats pretty new.  I will never ever recomend a neon to anyone.  Actually in a few months i am going to trade mine in because i hate it that much.<br><br>
