            In February of 2000, a family member of mine went against my advice and made the most costly mistake in her life, she bought a 2000 Kia.  The first week she had the car, the clutch completely quit working, and of course, this is not a warranty-covered item.  It ended up costing her just under $900.00 at the dealer for them to install a new clutch for her. They told her that she had apparently abused the clutch, and it would not be covered.  She continued to drive the car, and at 14,000 miles, they had to replace the transmission in the car, which fortunately was covered under the manufacturer's warranty.  She got the car back, drove it another 10,000 miles and had a short in the main wiring harness to the central computer (the ecm), which they could not track down.  So, they ended up rewiring that whole section of the car.  Just recently, at 29,000 miles, she was at the dealer getting the routine service performed on the car (oil &amp; filter change, 30,000 mile check-up), and they discovered not only an oil leak, but a &quot;slight tick&quot; in the lower end of the engine.  They provided her a rental car for 28 days, while they put new main bearings in the bottom end of the engine.  And now, she is lucky to average 15 miles per gallon with the car.

I am a used vehicle wholesaler myself, and told her not to even think of purchasing this car.  It has cost her a total of $2766.00 just to keep it running, out of her own pocket since February of 2000.  The only good thing about this vehicle, is that it was cheap to purchase.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  I will just be very satisfied in December of 2000, when she trades it off on a new Chevrolet of some sort.<br><br>
