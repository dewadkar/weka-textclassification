            The Chevy S-10 Xtreme is a beautiful truck that looks great cruising around town.  It is the best looking sport truck out there albeit not the fastest. As I drove a V-6 version with a 5 speed manual transmission and a third door, that is what the review will refer to.

  The suspension modifications along with the body kit place the truck just 6 inches off the ground.  The ride is smooth and quiet thanks to the better suspension and wide 235 55R16 tires. Cabin noise is close to zero the odd time I didn't have my stereo cranked.  Even on the freeway at 100mph (the trucks top speed thanks to a speed limiter) the road noise isn't too loud, plus the truck drives straight as an arrow with very little steering correction.  Watch out driving in the rain, the light back end kicks out if you are not careful with the gas pedal.

  The V-6 puts out an estimated 180 horsepower and goes 0-60mph in roughly 10 seconds.  It has good torque response whenever you mash the throttle and isn't too hard on gas.  I averaged about 19 MPG and I like to floor the gas pedal.  The engine is strong but doesn't come close to matching the acceleration that the truck looks like it should have.  Chevy should have given it a V-8 or at least put a supercharger on the V-6, then it would have the power to back up its looks.

  The interior isn't anything spectacular but it is nice enough.  The seats are plenty comfortable, in the front anyways.  The third fold down seat in the back is cramped, as one would expect, and you should only put small people back there.  The storage bin between the seats is useful, as is the tray in front of the shifter, for putting CDs or your cell phone.  The steering wheel is awesome!  The leather grip makes it stay in your hand perfectly plus it's soft.  The stock stereo is fine until you can put in an aftermarket system with a subwoofer.  You can have a sub in the back and still put someone in the jump seat.  The cup holders between the seats are great, except the bottom one is to close to the shifter so that when you slam it into fourth gear you demolish whatever glass is in that spot.  The heater works awesome as does the A/C.

  As for the box, it is 6 feet long so you can put some stuff in it, just not giant stuff.  I assume, however, if you are driving an Xtreme, that you did not buy it to haul big objects around like a work truck.  It is after all a sport truck.  The sportside box is better looking than the fleetside in my opinion, plus it gives you nifty little steps on the sides.


  I only had one problem with the truck.  It had an exhaust leak at the exhaust manifold and made a really annoying ticking noise whenever I drove.  Not the way to impress people.  I got it fixed and about a week later it started again.  Besides that I had no problems with the truck.

  This is a great truck to own.  It has beautiful looks, the best out of any truck.  If you want performance you could always slap a supercharger on it, or just go buy a Lightning.
