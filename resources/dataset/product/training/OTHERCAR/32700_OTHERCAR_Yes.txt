            I have owned foreign cars for the past 10 years, but when Chrysler created the 300M I was blown away. I decided to by a new car last year and there were only two I had in mind, the Lexus GS-300 and the Chrysler 300M. The Lexus was my first choice but after there was no compromising at all on the price I was quickly swayed to my second choice the 300M. I have really enjoyed all the stares and compliments that I have received since purchasing this car, it is stylish and eye-catching but there is also a darker side.

 I purchased a Slate 1999 300 with all the options and I was hoping to only have to take it in for a oil changes but that has not been the case. I still believe this is a great car I just think the workmanship could have been a lot better. I purchased my car in June of 99. I too have had to take my car back in for repair on the windows electronic motors that have gone out, first it was the driver side and the two rears. A month later the passenger side window went out, when I asked the service person why didn't they fix them all at once since this seems to be a common problem he told me they could only repair the parts that were broken. This did not set well with me at all having spent 29,000 and being persuaded that I was getting the best car my money could buy. I don't think Lexus would have given this type of service.

 My third trip to the dealer was to fix a flaw in my factory paint job which took over a week. My last visit which was last week was to pick my car up after having it towed back to the dealership after the sensor that tells the transmission what gear to be in quit working on my way home from work. I've also had a problem with the rattling noise inside the cab from the speakers when songs have a heavy base line, and I paid extra for the eleven speaker sound system.

  My last gripe is about the paint on the car it is far too easy to chip and dings seem to penetrate the cars metal with ease. I really expected a lot more for my money so it's hard for me to accept the fact that poor workmanship could take so much fun out of a car that is so much fun to drive.    <br><br>
