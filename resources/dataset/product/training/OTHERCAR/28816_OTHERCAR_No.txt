                 The Kodak DC-210 is for the most part, is a basic, point and shoot digital camera with okay image quality (1 Megapixel), but there are some things about that may appeal to you or may turn you off from buying this (more likely to turn you off though).

    First off, the Kodak DC-210 has less than average image quality (1 megapixel) which, at the time it was released, was good (average), yet now with all the other digital cameras for around this same cost, you can find 2 to 3 megapixels (a lot better image quality). Also, this camera has a few options, they are not useful whatsoever. For example, it has this effect in which you can put a cheesy boarder around the picture you take (yet it looks so bad that you will not even want to take a look at this; I mean, seriously, who wants to put a &quot;wooden&quot; boarder around a picture). And for this hefty price tag, options like video capture and picture effects would make this camera a lot better.

     Other than that, there are some pluses to having this camera. For people who are not looking for an elaborate, amazing image quality camera with little effects, this is pretty good. It works like that of a &quot;point and shoot&quot; camera and has nothing which make the owner confused. The storage card is comes with (and you can buy extras) holds a lot of high quality, large images.

     So all in all, I would not recommend this camera to those looking for really good quality digital pictures with effects, but if you are looking for an average point and shoot camera with an okay price tag, this is for you.<br><br>
