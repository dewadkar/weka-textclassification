            Over a year ago, my husband and I were in need of a second car again. I had been driving his car while he was over seas. We needed another one because it would be easier for us, especially when our son was born. So we start looking around for a used car, a family car. We narrowed our choices between a Grandam and a Skylark. We choose the Skylark, it was a little cheaper. We bought it from a private owner. Which if you don't know the person I wouldn't recommend unless they have all the receipts of services done to the car. 

The man (was a mechanic in the army) we bought our car from, told us he did all the services himself. Being  that we were unaware and uneducated, we trusted that he did a good job.

Now a year later we have put out so much money, Well in my eyes it is more than we should have. First the service engine light would come on for no appreant reason. Then if you were in idle to long the car would stall. And this is not funny, when you are stuck in traffic or at a light in a busy intersection. So overall we now know what the problem is. We need to replace the mass air flow censor. It took us spending over $600.00 to find this out. The car people didn't fix the problem the first time, they did a basic tune-up and service.

I am not sure if all the skylarks have this problem, but please be aware if your buying used and from a private owner.Don't get me wrong, I would probably have a better outlook if we didn't have all these mechanical problems. <br><br>
