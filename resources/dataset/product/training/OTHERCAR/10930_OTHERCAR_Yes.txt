            As a late twenty-something banking on some future income, I came across this entry level BMW amidst a field of other well-respected car lines such as Acura, Volvo, and Audi. 
I decided on getting a BMW not because of price, but rather because of it's clear superior quality. After test driving an A4, a 3.2TL, and the Volvo S40, the 323i just blew me away and was far and above the best. Little was I prepared for the pleasures of driving a rear-wheel drive vehicle, and having been hit with a six-inch snow storm literally a few days after driving off the lot, my fears about poor-weather handling were gone. It did fine, and it performs just as well on any other road condition. 
Having driven an Audi 80 for the past few years and having grown accustomed to German engineering, I didn't think driving could get much more fun, but it has. I shelled out the money to get the Premium package with leather and the H/K stereo system, but it's worth it. My commute every morning is fun rather than a chore now. Simply put, this car makes driving FUN. The car is so responsive, I take curves with confidence. And the engine purrs with power when needed. If you have the money, and are looking to enter that next level in cars, I highly recommend this vehicle! 
The only drawback I can think of is the price one pays for premuim gasoline and the less than superior gas mileage that the larger engine requires. Otherwise, enjoy the ride.<br><br>
