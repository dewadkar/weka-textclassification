            I bought a 1998 Plymouth Neon in early 2000.  It had roughly 49,000 miles and it seemed in excellent condition.  I was a college student and this was my first "new car" and it was (or SEEMED is the better word) a cheap, reliable, cute car. The dealer really pushed this car, though I was interested in a Chevy Cavalier.  However, after the test drive I fell in love and thought I'd found the perfect car.  And I had, for about 8 months.

AND THEN IT STARTED!!!!

Granted I have put a lot of miles on my car, it is now March of 2003 and I have 99,800.  In the time that I have had it, however, I have replaced the head gasket, water pump, and other parts relative to the head gasket when it basically blew up on me to the tune of $900.  This was at about 78,000 miles.  I have replaced the transmission because it DID blow up on me, leaving a close to basketball size hole in the top.  Luckily I found a used transmission and a mechanic that felt sorry for me and it only cost me $700.  ONLY. HA!.  It would have cost roughly $1200 for a new transmission without the labor included.  This actually happened BEFORE the head gasket problem at about 70,000 miles. 

Other problems I've had are the trunk leaking (and I have an amp and sub woofers back there that almost got fried), the "Service Engine Soon" light going on and off erratically at first and now on all the time, electrical problems dealing with the tail lights/blinkers, the gear shift cable breaking, the "Door Ajar" light going on and off erratically and then now staying on, and problems with the battery.  In cold weather the battery light would come on when I started the car, but it threatened to just die most of the time. There also now seems to be a Rear Main Seal leak/problem and a Main Gasket Seal leak/problem.  Also, the windows rattle incessantly, since there is no frame supporting them around the top and they are supposed to fit into the seal on the body of the car.  The seals are poorly made and the wind rushes around them at higher speeds (over 45) and is VERY noisy.

The bumpers are cheaply, cheaply made.  I did slide into a ditch last winter and had the car checked out afterwards and I did absolutely no damage to anything except the front bumper which seemed to hold up fairly well, other than a small crack in the center that was virtually undetectable.  However, once it got cold and some ice formed on the bumper, that baby gave way like it was afraid to stay attached!  It fell right off and I'm now missing the front middle section.  It cannot be repaired and the WHOLE entire bumper has to be fixed for the low, low cost of only $500-$600.  And the body itself has no give in it when it comes to getting hit. I was bumped in the parking lot at work and it left a very noticeable dent in the side panel of the driver's side, and the paint chipped and cracked all around it.

I had some trouble with the car shaking between 50 and 55 mph, and then it would quit when I hit 60.  I believe this to have something to do with the suspension, though I'm not entirely sure.  The tires also wore out very quickly on this car and I've had them replaced 3 times now.  I just took it in because when I hit 50 it shakes like it's on a washboard but it doesn't stop when it hits 60 anymore.  I was told the tires are bad AGAIN.  Even with brand new tires this is not a snow/ice car and handles very poorly, sliding on any slick surface.  

All around, this was a horrible car.  I'm enormously disappointed.  I have a friend that runs a dealership and they have told me that Neon's depreciate in value VERY quickly which I've found in recent months to be true.  Even if my Neon were in perfect shape no dealership would offer me more than $1200 for it, and I still owe $5600!  It has made it almost impossible for me to find a newer, more reliable vehicle.  This vehicle has been the bane of my existence since I bought it, and I cannot WAIT to get rid of it.  I will never by another Neon as long as I live, and will tell as many people as I can not to buy one either.
