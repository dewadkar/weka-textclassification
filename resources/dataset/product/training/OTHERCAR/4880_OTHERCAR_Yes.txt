            I love the Infiniti G20.  By far, the greatest aspect of owning a G20 is simply that it is an Infiniti.  The pleasure in telling people that you drive an Infiniti without the guilt of spending over $23,000.  Most people are not aware of the G20, they just assume that it is an Infiniti and must be an expensive luxury car.

The G20 does not have any special feature, but the one thing that makes it special is that is comes fully loaded from the factory.  With CD/Alarm/Dual Airbags/ABS, not to mention rear seat headrests (which have been complimented previously.)

Without seeing that the car is a G20, it can easily be mistaken for a low-model BMW.<br><br>
