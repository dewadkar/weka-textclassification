            I like corvette's the best for a sports car and they are cheap and I think people should buy them more often because they are American cars that are easy to use and they are cheap to fix because they are popular and they have a option to have automatic or manual.  Because some people can't drive manuals.  I love the convertible the best because they look goo and you don't have to use your air allot and you can have some fresh air.  But if you are worried about your hair allot I wouldn't buy this car because it messes up your hair when you have it down and if you like racing you can race on the street accept for it is illegal or you might want to try to race it on a track for money or just for fun.  I like the newer corvettes but that really depends on the buyer.<br><br>
