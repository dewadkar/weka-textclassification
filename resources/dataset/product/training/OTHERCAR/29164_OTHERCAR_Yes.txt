            I was reading another review and just had to add my two cents worth. I've gotta agree with Hushgf34 opinion, the 95 Neon was a dud. Anytime we drove this car through a car wash, it would stall, and not start for up to an hour. Had too many other little items go wrong with this car to name. We had to dump it! Took it to a car deal and bought a new car. We went back a couple of weeks later to see what kind of price the dealer had on it. There was no price, just a big sign that said, &quot;Do not drive!&quot;  Even they found it out it was a dud!

However, don't despair! Not all Neon's are created equal.. Bought a 99 Neon, 2 door, sunroof, spoiler, the works. These cars have always been &quot;cute&quot;, (though I thing the 2000 have lost the cute look.).  The 99 has lot's of zip and is fun to take out on the road. Open the sunroof, crank up the tunes. What could be finer? Handling is decent, and the ride has improved since 95. Driven 30,000 miles in a little over a year and no major problems yet.

Make sure you check out Consumer's Report, Edmund's,  or some other reliable, independent car books before buying a Neon. Some year's were rated fine....some should be avoided. AVOID THE 95'S.<br><br>
