            Recently, after getting into an auto accident, I was left to make the choice of buying a new vehicle.  I love pickup trucks and so I knew exactly what I was shopping for.  I searched the dealerships, but it wasn't until I reached the Toyota dealership that I knew exactly what I wanted.  A little to midsize truck that would last me through a great deal of miles.  Everyone there was so nice, offering me what they could in my price range.  I bought my Toyota Tacoma and its the best little truck I have seen around, not to mention the best looking as well.  The makers at Toyota prove they are one of the best producers of pickups.  My Tacoma has made me a very satisfied customer.  It delivered everything I was looking for and more.  If you ever want to buy a good running truck, that wont nickle and dime you on gas, try any Toyota truck.  Not only am I a Toyota owner but 3 out of 4 members of my family have become one too.  I promise you cant go wrong, and if you do, then Toyota will fix your problem.<br><br>
