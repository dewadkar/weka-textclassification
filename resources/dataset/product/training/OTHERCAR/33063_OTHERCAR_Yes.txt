            After 10,000 miles on my 2500 Cummins 4WD Dodge Ram I have no regrets and plenty of satisfaction. Fuel consumption is about 16 MPG, a little lower than the salesman suggested, but still satisfactory. Acceleration is brisk  when the turbocharger comes into full play and has surprised more than one car at the stoplight. With the long bed it is a big vehicle and takes some strategy in choosing parking spaces so you have enough room to back out- you find yourself parking far from where you intend to go. 

Once moving, it drives comfortably but somewhat stiff. I use the truck to commute to work (25 miles one way) and for weekend visits to our cabin in the San Diego desert, where we drive off-road. Off road the Dodge is well mannered, with plenty of ground clearance and decent flotation on sand with the 265X16.5 stock tires. 

I use it to tow my 18 foot aluminum boat, about a 2500 lb load. This is hardly noticeable and well below the 11,000 lb tow capacity. 

I like the truck-sized components used on the 2500 unlike the 1500 which uses lighter components. Like my 95 Dodge 3500 which has 10,000 miles of Baja off road driving with a camper, it is not going to break. We have two Dodge trucks and two Toyotas, a Land Cruiser (84) and a Tacoma, and 2001 Ram 2500 is my favorite. And the six speaker CD/stereo is great too.<br><br>
