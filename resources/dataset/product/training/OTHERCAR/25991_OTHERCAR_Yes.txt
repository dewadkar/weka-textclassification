            I just purchased a 2000, Cavalier with all the trimmings.This is the first time I have purchased a sporty car and am well satisfied .The CD player sounds awesome and and everything is in close reach to turn on and off or adjust .This car has been through a snow storm and have had no problems with it handling the road.The sport package option is great at the offered price and and added to the look of the car.I would highly recommend this vehicle for anyone looking for something sporty and yet affordable.I have gotten nothing but compliments on my car !

Love my cavalier !<br><br>
