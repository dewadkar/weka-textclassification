            I dont want to sound too much like a child but the new Nissan Xterra has got to be one of the most fantastic sport utility vehicle's I have ever had the pleasure to drive! Its great this car has everything you could possibly need such as 4 wheel drive, a great car rack, duel airbags, and a GREAt look. I'm deffinitly thinking about purchasing one or possibly even leasing an Xterra. You can take these things anywhere too, through water, mudd, rocky feilds, it handles great. Personally I deffinitly reccomend this SUV. I think its the best one out on the market!<br><br>
