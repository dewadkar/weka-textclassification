            First and foremost, this car is a mixture of both good and bad.  Let's start the goods first:  The 93 740i is a nice handling car considering its size and weight.  The engine is very smooth and the interior is very roomy and comfy.  Well, that's about all I could pull out of my mind for the strong points about this car.  Now let's start with the bad; if I am spending this kind of money ($65,000) on this car, I expect better build quality and reliability.  I truthfully think besides an old Jaguar, this car is the next one on line to score an F on reliability.  

After driving the car for about 15,000 miles, problem after problem start to creep up.  First, it was the electrical stuff (display on the dash board, trip computer, stereo...etc. Constantly!), then after 50,000 miles there comes all the mechanical nightmares.  At first, the water pump failed.  After replacing another one, in about 2 month, the same problem occured again.  Then the motor mounts start to fail over and over again after a number of different replacements.  Eventually, the hoses and pipes start to deteriorate and age at an accelerated rate.  Next, there are more and more noises in the cabin than you would expect in anycar.  The noise include rattling of parts, amplified mechanical noise, and various other mysterious sounds.  Also, oil and different fluid leaks are constant problems.  Finally, one day, the brake hose came loose and start to rub against some metal panels and created some sparks; this lead to an interesting &quot;engine compartment fire show.&quot;  By the way, all these time, non of the problem has been cured completely, they just start multiplying in their number.  

The end result of the car?  The 740 has problems with over 50% of its electronics, everything in the engine compartment has been repaired at least 3-5 times.  At that point, I've decided to trade this POS in and get a new Mercedes E430 (I wrote a review on that as well).  People might think that the car was not repaired properly by the mechanics, but I really doubt that.  Both the dealers, 3 BMW shops, and a very reputable mechanic shop in the area has tried to solve car troubles.  However, it seems like nothing would stay fixed while everyday a new mechanical flaw would pop up.  

Finally, I asked a good friend of mine who is a very respected mechanic around my area about BMWs; his opinion:  &quot;Well, my family and I used to buy Bimmers, why do you think we stopped buying them.  Ask an experienced mechanic who is capable of giving an unbiased opinion (ie: not some Bimmer nut that fix Bimmers in their BMW special shop or shops like Dinan that do tunings for Bimmers), he will tell you that those car are maintenance nightmares, especially the 5, 7, and 8 series.  I did my research and got similar opinions from other mechanics.  Don't let that propeller badge fool you, you will pay a lot for the play.  At the last year and half of ownership, I was spending an average of around $1,000/mo to make the car drivable.  By the way, I spun out 3 times in the rain in this Bimmer eventhough I was not driving fast and I HAVE TRACTION CONTROL.<br><br>
