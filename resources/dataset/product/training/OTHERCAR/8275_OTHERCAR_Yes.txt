            I love MY GEO!!! I bought this car outta desperation after my divorce. I had $2000 and that was it to find a reliable, gas efficient, affordable car. Well I went looking and told the clerk to pleaseeeee have something that my money would cover that was all I stated above! He pulled up in this little green(station wagon) looking car. It was so cute!!! And it looked brand new! I thought he must've made a mistake but he wanted 1700 for it. I was amazed! I am very mechanically inclined so I took it for a spin a couple blocks down the road, pulled to the side popped the hood and to my amazement everything under the hood was very easily accessable for any repair jobs maybe needed one day. Hmmm No oil leaks or vacuum leaks what so ever, everything worked and the interior and exterior looked Brand Spankin new!   I hopped out and said &quot;SOLD&quot; I will never ever have another car, I have only had one major repair needed, my own fault, i blew a head gasket 200 miles from home and kept going... it made me all he way to my drive safely with a blown head gasket. I had to get the head resurfaced for this little NO NO I did! As far as it goes I got the car in 1997 and still have it, this's november 2000  I love &quot;hermie&quot;(its name) so much that i just had a brand new crankshaft rods pistons bearings(rod &amp; main) and a valve job. Hey for 800 bucks in parts and machine shop charges Herbie is the same as a brand new car now and will last me for years to come.. and he still looks brand new. Another plus is that theres plenty of leg room in front and the hatch is great for groceries and shopping sprees! 44 miles to the gallon and great insurance prices.<br><br>
