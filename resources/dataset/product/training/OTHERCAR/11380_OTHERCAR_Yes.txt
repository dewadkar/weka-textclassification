            This year we changed from a Ford Aerostar (truck body) to the Caravan.  What a difference in driving.  We feel like we're driving an automobile instead of a van.  As for the rest, it's utilitarian, but haven't found a better way to go yet.

The passenger seat is adequate as is the middle seat.  The back seat is awkward for anyone over the age of say 10.  The driver seat is fine once you get in.  I have a problem hitting my head climbing into the van.  I hate getting my hair messed up all the time.  

We aren't quite a year into ownership, but have had no maintenance problems whatsoever.  Mileage is not great, but this is a van and expected.  <br><br>
