            I do selling on eBay and needed a good digital Camera. I am also the mother of two, and this is a great way to take as many pictures of my children as I want.  My mother had the FD81 and my husband and I really liked the quality of the pictures!  So when we compaired, we thought we were getting the top of the line in Sony Mavicas.  Too bad I didn't com here first huh?  It is $100 more than the FD83 and the pixals are MUCH lower, about half. So its not as sharp, ok for eBay, but I want my family pictures to look like they came from a 35MM.  It also take about 40secs or more to take the picture, so it is hard to capture a moving toddler or pets that way.  If I had done my home work I would have gotten a Nikon for my money, and not worried about the ease of the floppy disc.  Now for the good, the floppy disc feature has really come in handy. You really never run out of memory if you have enough discs, and when I am with friends and they want a copy, I can just copy the disc right there and give it to them. Its easy for a novice to use, now wondering how to down load, just slip in the floppy drive and open.   It has a very good zoom &amp; image stabalization so you can use it for sporting situations.  The battery seems to last a long time to me, and I have a two others, so never really have a dead battery.  Between eBay and deveolping charges, I personally beleive I have gotten my $1000.00 back already!!  So buy one, only if you think it will meet your needs, but look into a Nikon first.
