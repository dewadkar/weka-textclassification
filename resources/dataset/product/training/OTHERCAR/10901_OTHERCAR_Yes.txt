            If you are in the market for a new car in the range of 35-40G, look no more. Here is a great car with a great value.

--My Story: I recently purchased a silver 2000 BMW 328i. The previous car that I drove was an Honda Civic EX coupe. But it was no ordinary Civic, I spent a lot of money and time on it to improve its looks and performance. I just wanted to tell you this so I have something tangible to compare to my new BMW.
I went into the BMW dealer ready to purchase the car. I had been looking for a month already and had been researching on this car. Though I have to admit I wanted a 328Ci, I settled with the 328i because of the lack of availability (this was in early august 1999) and because they did not offer the sport package on the 328Ci yet.
Ok, so I chose a Silver 328i with sport package, luxury package, xenon headlamps, heated seats, and fold down rear seats. I negotiated with the salesperson and got the MSRP price of $40,550 down to $38,700 with a free LoJack (worth $600). I was happy with the price, and 2 days later I picked up my new car and was ready to cruise!

--The review: Well, it's been about 8 months now since I first picked up my car from the dealer. And I have to say I am very pleased with the BMW 328i. There are so many features on this car, I will just name a few that I found useful, or worth talking about.
First of all, I love the little toolkit they have for you stuck on the trunk. Also, they have a full-size spare, but it's not just the tire... it comes with a full size rim too! Secondly, I love the sport suspension. Though my BMW sits high as compared to my last car, the lowered Civic, it handles superbly around corners. Sway is minimum and ride is stiff (as i like it). Best of all, the ride is stiff but soft... unlike my civic, my BMW shocks and suspension absorbs many of the potholes and bumps that i go over. I always thought a lower car meant sacrificing the soft ride. But you'll find the BMW 328i sport suspension handles the ride incredibly well while being lower to the ground. Another thing I want to mention is the power and brakes of this car. They are great! Fast acceleration and fast stopping. Oh yeah, if you do get this car, be sure to get the xenon headlamps option. They are wonderful... very bright and help you see much better at night.
Ok, so the down sides? I can't really complain much.. but the speakers are not that good. Also, my brake pedal is squeaking... but it's a little problem some WD40 can solve. What else? Hmmm.... Oh yeah.. the brake dust. There's just too much brake dust coming out from the front brakes... I know, I know, BMW's are notorious for the brake dust.. I wonder if there is some way to get rid of all that brake dust... that's about it for the down sides.

--Recommendation: Well, I strongly recommend this car for its great value and great, well.. everything. So go to your nearest BMW dealer and pick one up! Need I say more? <br><br>
