            My husband and I travel frequently.  He is 6'4 and has problems with his knees since an auto accident several years ago.  Therefore, most cars are very uncomfortable for him.  That's why we looked at the minivans.  We discussed the different makes and models, and compared online.  In past experience, the Dodge vehicles seemed to be most dependable, so we test drove the Grand Caravan.  It is a very comfortable, dependable vehicle.  Our only problem, though, is that the passenger sliding door has a rattle that is very irritating.  It is only an occasional problem, but with our work schedule, we have a hard time getting it back to the dealer to be checked.  Another feature would be good for someone with children is the automatic door locks.  When you reach a speed of 15MPH, the doors automatically lock.  This can be irritating if you forget to unlock the doors and go to the back to open it.  Overall, it is a very good vehicle, especially for families.
