            My husband and I bought a new Acura 3.2 TL in April 2001.  With a hot Wisconsin summer coming up and broken air conditioning  (big bucks to fix) in my old car, we decided to go ahead and car shop.  After looking at several others, specifically the <b>Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Volkswagen Passat and Mazda 626</b> (check out my other reviews!), we test drove and chose the <b>2001 Acura 3.2 TL</b> for its classic looks, luxury interior, and fantastic ride.

<b>Overview</b>
The TL was the last car that I test drove in our shopping trip. The fact that we were even looking at Acuras was on a lark - my husband owns and adores a '96 Integra, and because he's a brand fanatic, we had to go to the dealership. I was afraid that we would be wasting the salespersons time, but as it turns out, we did not!

The Acura 3.2 TL is defined as a mid-size luxury car.  In my humble epinion, it's the best.

<b>Exterior - Understated, Classic.</b>
You won't attract a lot of attention driving the TL. It's not a showy car. But it does have classic good looks that you can be proud of.  A cousin of the Honda Accord, the TL shares a similar body style. The exterior is dressed up with silver door handles, and a slightly sporty, aggressive looking front grille design. The word ACURA is proudly displayed across the backside of the trunk, along with Acura's circle/precision logo.

<b>The Interior - Leather, Fake Wood, and Options Galore</b>
The interior of the TL is quite impressive. Leather everywhere, with accents of  faux "burlwood trim". I think the plastic "wood" trim on all upscale cars is kind of funny, but hey, it seems that all the car manufacturers are doing the fake wood thing.

The fake wood is standard as an accent piece on the interior doors and along the sides of the center shift console. If you really like the fake wood trim, you can get it almost everywhere on the dash and shift area (please, don't do it!!).   

The dash layout is great - nice looking controls, everything at your fingertips. The dash is very similar to the Honda Accord. Visibility from the driver's seat is very good, and is improved at night with the TL's bright halogen headlights. 

The interior is roomy and comfortable. It seats 5. Another big plus of the TL - heated front leather seats with high/low settings. (I'm looking forward to winter!)

<b>Options</b>
One of the unique things about Acura is that there aren't many options available. This is because all the cars come loaded with standard features. Want a moonroof, CD player, remote locks, alloy wheels, traction control, ABS, driver and passenger front and side airbags, child safety locks??? It's all standard.  Let me tell you, owning a loaded car is a lot of fun. The standard features are great. Driving this car makes me feel pampered - every need is met - there is nothing left to want.

The only significant option on the TL is an optional NAVI system. NAVI is a build in navigation tool that has a screen (about 10 inches) built-in the dashboard. The program is run off computer CDs that are housed in a computer system located in the trunk. The NAVI system allows you to see maps of where you are traveling. I don't have this option on my car, as the $2,000 retail cost was prohibitive for us.

<b>Driving - Pure Pleasure</b>
The car is pure pleasure to drive. It's as simple as that.  The ride is smooth and quiet, and the V6 engine provides plenty of power.  The evening that I test drove the TL was the night I had to have one - I loved the smooth and ultra-quiet ride, the great visibility, the feel of the leather wrapped steering wheel in my hands - driving the TL is a wonderful experience. Go drive one and see what I mean.

<b>Fun Stuff</b>
The Acura 3.2 TL has a <b>Bose sound system</b> that is great. It includes a single CD player (not 6 discs like many others).  It also has a tape player, which may be convenient for audio book fans. There's an integrated CD storage compartment in the dash that holds 4 CDs. One feature of the sound system that I love and use frequently is the volume control mounted right on the steering wheel.  Another great feature is the button that allows you to scan stations when you're out of town. It automatically sets all the stations in the area to your preset buttons, but saves your preset buttons so you can get back to them when you return home. 

Another fun feature of the TL is the <b>triptonic transmission</b>. This feature allows you to go from automatic mode to a quasi-manual mode where you can "manual" shift for a more fun drive. The triptonic transmission is programmed to override the "manual" feature if you are not doing it right. (Sorry for the non-tech description, I don't use this feature, standard auto is fine for me!)

<I>Did I mention the cup holders??</I>  
They're conveniently hidden from view when not in use. Located above the shift control and covered by panels. Press the button, the panels part, and there they are! 

<b>O.K. Nothing is Perfect. </b>
I have one major complaint about my TL - the driver's seat squeaks when going over bumps. This is annoying, and the dealer was unsuccessful fixing it the first time. They worked with one of the bolts on the seat to try to fix it. So my beloved TL is going back to the dealer again for another try. 

<b>Pricing </b>
We were lucky to buy the car when the dealership was trying to get rid of it's 2001 models to make room for the incoming 2002s. I was surprised that they were doing this in  April, when many other brands have closeouts in the fall. 

At our first visit, we were offered the price of $26,900. We tried to negotiate, but finally accepted the initial offer. I think we got a good deal, although I know that some people do better, getting even closer to the cars invoice (which is about $26,200.)  All in all, I think we got a great value for our money - I doubt that we could have gotten a car of equal or better quality for a better price.

<b>I'm Keeping it Forever </b>
I <b>LOVE</b> my  TL!!!!!  I hope to keep this car for about 12 years, 200,000+ miles, until it dies at a very old age.  If  you're looking for a new car, I strongly encourage you to take a good look at Acura's products, and  if you're looking for a sedan, definitely check out the TL - it's awesome.

Thanks for reading my epinion - have fun car shopping!!
