            We were very pleased with our purchase of a used 1991 GMC Jimmy 2-door.  My husband had wanted something a little more durable, and we liked the looks of this one.

Overall, we liked the vehicle.  It had a lot of pick-up, and we loved the fact that it was 4-wheel drive.  Made those hard winters living on a steep hill much easier to deal with.  It always got us where we wanted to go.

Our only major problem, and it WAS a major one, was that we seemed to have constant transmission troubles.  Maybe it was just this particular vehicle, but we never knew for sure.  At one point we had to have a completely new transmission installed, and I probably don't have to tell you that that does not come cheap!  And even after we did this, it still just never seemed to act right.  We always seemed to have trouble getting it to shift correctly.  Seemed like it wanted to stall out and drag an awful lot.  Even on flat surfaces it sometimes felt like it wanted to slip out of gear.

One of the things we were looking forward to when we had our Jimmy was using it to pull our 17-foot boat to the docks.  We never had much good luck with that.  Seemed like it just couldn't handle the weight correctly, and we ended up weaving all over the place with it.

And I know that 2-door vehicles are never that easy to get into and out of when it comes to the back seat, but with this vehicle it was just miserable.  It was so high off the ground that it was physically exhausting for a person with short legs like me to get in and out of the back seat.

And let's talk a little about the ride.  As rough as sandpaper!  I realize SUV's are designed to be a littel rougher of a ride, but this one was downright awful.  Crossing over cracks in the concrete of the local bridge was like going mudding in the mountains....ladies, be sure you wear a good strong bra otherwise you are liable to get a black eye!

I don't mean to make this vehicle sound completely awful by any means.  We did like having it, and when it came to getting around in bad weather, we were always pleased with its performance.  It would be an ideal car for an active single person or couple.  But for families it is just not that comfortable or convenient.<br><br>
