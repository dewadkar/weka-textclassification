            I bought the HP PhotoSmart 215 at Best Buy for $129.99. It was on sale from $150 and since i was looking for an inexpensive yet not cruddy camera this was an excellent time to get one.  I did quite a bit of research on it, reading the epinions here, and on other sites.  I looked at samples of photos from it, etc.  I wanted a camera that would take nice pictures and most of the time it does.  When you open up the box theres a camera, battery, a thing that goes around your wrist, a USB Cable, a CD and a memory card.  The memory card is only 4 mb which can hold up to 5 ultra-fine photos, 10 fine photosand 35 normal photos.  I really can not tell the difference between the ultra-fine photos and the fine photos so i usually will use FINE.  
The only bad thing about the camera is the delay that it has.  When you click the button it takes like 2 seconds before the picture is actually taken.  This might not matter if your taking pictures of scenery or something like that.  But if your taking pictures of wildlife or something that moves it might cause problems.  Another thing that is annoying is that when you take a picture and it shows on the little LCD screen the picture looks very bad but then when you actually upload it on your computer, the picture looks 100 times better.  It also eats batteries like nothing.  You may read that you can't use rechargable batteries with this camera.. well thats nonsense.  i have used rechargable batteries and the camera still works fine!

So if you want a decent digital camera but don't want to spend a ton of money get the HP PhotoSmart 215.  It has 1.3 megapixels and is an awesome camera for the price!
