            As usual Saturn produces another winner. In it's first midsize product it brings another level to the Saturn. The &quot;L&quot; Series brings more comfort for traveling, caring larger loads in the truck. The full package of extra's(cd/tape player) is a nice touch without adding to the final price. 

I purchased the LS 1 4dr dark red. It drives with comfort of a larger car. There are no blind spots. With the vehicle being slightly larger it is easier to enter and exit. We have a 1993 SL 4dr. which is still going strong.

If there is a problem it wold be in the side view mirrors. We were one of the first people in area to take ownership of the new LS series. So when the mirrors started to whistle we were concerned that the problem couldn't fixed. But as Saturn has proven it's customer service is top of the line. At first they suggested a new mirror to replace the whistler's. But it proved unsuccessful. By this time other's had found the problem.  the solution was to put a sealant on the mirror which has proven to be fine. It's a winner<br><br>
