            I bought this car new in March of 1996. It was a closeout, a 1995 Lx 5 spd. I currently have 153K miles.

My experience over seven years of use has been very positive. It always starts and the original battery lasted 3.5 years. I've had no engine or transmission problems and it does not leak any fluids. The interior beige cloth fabric is still nice looking and is easy to clean(short velour). The white paint still shines nicely. And finally, I still average 35 mpg in mixed city/highway driving.

My problems with the car have been relatively minor. Here is a list of them:

1. Defrost switch replace under warranty- 15K.
2. O2 sensor replaced at 102K.
3. Cracked exhaust manifold replaced at 102K.
4. Original brake pads replaced at 116K.
5. Faulty light switch replaced under warranty at 125K.
6. Muffler replaced at 135K.
7. A/C compressor replaced at 148K.

The brake pads obviously were not a mechanical problem, but I listed them to show how good they were. 

Parts from the dealer for this car can be high . For example, the A/C compressor was $360 new and had to be gotten from the dealer. But to save money, I got a used Mazda Protege muffler for $6 at a local pull-apart(junk yard), and a used exhaust manifold for $80 from a nationwide used parts dealer and did both jobs myself.

I've done all the required maintenance through the years. I trusted the dealer do the timing belts and had them replace the water pump with the second timing belt change at 135K.
