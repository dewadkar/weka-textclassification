            I purchased my Kodak DC3200 several months ago from Best Buy for $149.00. Since the price was so low I had doubts on how good the quality would be. After the first picture all doubts were gone and I had a smile from one end of my face to the other. 

The picture quality is amazing. Even in the lowest quality setting the pictures are razor sharp with true to life colors. The camera does an excellent job at adjusting from the bright outdoors to dimly lit indoors. 

This camera is packed with features you normally wouldn't expect to find in this price range. 
The LCD display is crystal clear even in bright sunlight. All features are menu selectable and easy to figure out. Some of the features include adjusting the white balance (Auto, Daylight, Fluorescent, Tungsten), 2X Zoom, ability to turn Quickview and Preview ON/OFF, Thumbnails and a programmable Slide Show function. There's also a jack on the side of the camera that allows you to hook it up to your TV and display the Slide Show! 

The 2 meg of internal memory is ok to start out with. At the lowest quality setting you can store up to 30 pictures. Of course there IS a slot for a CompactFlash card if you need more capacity. 
Pictures are quickly loaded into your PC via a serial cable. The included software is straightforward and very easy to use. 

Battery life is excellent (as long as you're not living in the 80's by using alkaline's). I purchased a set of Ni-MH rechargeable batteries at Walmart for under $15.00. So far I'm still on the original charge and I've taken well over 100 pictures. 

There's not much to dislike about this camera. A self timer function and a USB port would have been nice.
