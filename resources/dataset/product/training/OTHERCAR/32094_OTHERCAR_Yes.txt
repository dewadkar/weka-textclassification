            I have always been a car guy and I have always liked fast cars. My previous vehicles included a 1985 Mazda RX7, a 1988 Mustang LX 5.0, a 1986 Buick Regal Grand National, and a 1998 Pontiac Formula. In the fall of 2000, it became painfully clear to me that, despite my resistance, I had to give up the Formula and get a "family" car. Our first child was born in April 1999 and it was pretty ridiculous for me to tote her around in a sports coupe with a vestigial rear seat. So, I began my quest for a 4-door vehicle that was as sporty as possible. After doing my research, the cars that rose to the top of the list were the Acura 3.2 TL, the Infiniti I30, the Nissan Maxima SE, and the Chrysler 300M.

I test drove all four cars that I was considering and the 300M came out the clear winner (for me.) Why? Two simple reasons -- style and interior room. First of all, I think that the 300M is one of the most stunning looking cars on the road today. Chrysler used to make some incredibly boring cars but in the last several years, all of that has changed. They have taken some chances in the styling department and in my opinion, they have hit the target more times than not. From every angle, the 300M is automotive sculpture. As for the interior room issue, I decided that if I was going to buy a car with 4 doors, I was going to get as much interior space as possible. This quickly moved the 300 to the top of the list above the other three cars that I mentioned. The Chrysler LHS is larger, but it isn't sporty enough for me.

My 300 has the Performance Handling Package which includes larger wheels and tires, tighter (more responsive) steering, and suspension upgrades. It does make the ride a little rougher than on the standard 300M, but what it gives up in ride cushyness it more than makes up for in the handling department. I am constantly amazed that a car this size can handle like it does. Kudos to the Chrysler suspension engineers. And even with PHP, the ride on the highway is excellent.

The 300M has a 253 horsepower, 3.5 liter V6 under the hood. It lacks a bit of low end torque but it picks up nicely around 3000 rpm and pulls rather well up to about 5000-5500. I have no complaints about the level of power in this car. 

The only negatives that I can think of are a couple of trim details, such as the leather seating surfaces are not quite as soft as I would like them to be, and the wood on the dash is fake. Of course this isn't a Lexus or BMW and it didn't cost me $40,000 so it's really not that big a deal.

In conclusion, if you are a driving enthusiast at heart and for whatever reason are faced with the reality that you have to buy a 4 door vehicle, the 300M deserves your serious consideration. I have not regretted my purchase for one minute.
