                 So far I have had only one real problem with my new 2001 PT cruiser. I can't keep the outside windows clean! This problem has gotten so bad that I've been forced to carry a bottle of glass cleaner and towels with me at all times. I park my Cruiser, come back a few moments later and it's always the same thing. Fingerprints! Faceprints!! People just can't keep there hands or noses off it. I'm afraid I'm going to come out to my vehicle someday and find someone staggering around with severe neck trauma from craning there head in every conceivable direction trying to see every beautiful angle of this wonderful car, both inside and out.
     I exagerate a bit, of course, but not to much. My white 2001 PT Cruiser Touring Edition is a people magnet. I know it has me hooked. From It's comfortable and roomy leather interior (and I'm no small guy), to it's retro good looks this car is a winner. 
     The one touch optional moonroof opens without a glitch and the six speaker in dash am/fm cd/cassette player sounds great. I ordered the Touring Edition package with 16&quot; rims, 60 series tires and stiffer suspension and the steering is tight and responsive.
     The ride feel is a bit firm but you get a good feel for the road. The a/c works very well and back seat occupants said they were comfortable after the initial cool down of the interior. (I live in Phoenix, AZ. As I write this it is 110 outside.)
     At first I was concerned about the power of the 2.4 liter dual overhead cam 4 cylinder engine, the only powerplant available for this vehicle, and to be sure this is no sports car. Acceleration off the line is a bit tepid but the engine produces abundant upper end power.
     I had no problems merging into freeway traffic and several times on the open stretches I had to back off, not realizing I was hitting over 85mph. I found it was a capable and comfortable long haul cruiser and it performed admirably in the around town scuttle. So far my gas mileage has averaged 19mpg in city and 24mpg on the open road.
     So, would I recomend this car to you? We'll that all depends on what your looking for. The price is reasonable in todays market. I paid just a little over $20,000 with all the bells and wistles. (SE Touring Package, Leather, Power Windows/Door locks, Four Wheel ABS, Center Roof Console with Compass and Trip Computer, Power Mirrors, 4 speed Automatic, etc.) Base price begins at $16,400.
     Interior comfort is excellent and the versitility of the flip, fold, removable seats is almost magic. It does well as an urban commuter, seating four real adults comfortably. If you are of the t.v. size adult variety then you can seat five but the rear seat occupants had better be friendly. 
     As a family vehicle the PT shines brightly with plenty of room for kids and cargo. All three rear seat positions provide shoulder harnesses for safety and dual front air bags and front side impact air bags are available. The rear adjustable position shelf is a nice touch, serving as either a cargo restraint, wet cargo tray, blind shelf to hide things under or even a little picnic table.
     If your looking for a sports car you may be willing to trade a little ooomph for the beautiful body curves, but seriously disturbed rocket jockeys need look elsewhere. There are rumors of a turbo charged edition sold under the Dodge nameplate being available next year, but that is yet to be seen.  
     Oh! one little thing that does bug me is the location of the rear power window switches. They are inconveniently located at the rear of the center console. The driver or passenger has to twist back with there hand to find them and rear seat passengers have to lean forward almost in half to roll the windows up or down. Look for this as something to be changed in later models.<br><br>
