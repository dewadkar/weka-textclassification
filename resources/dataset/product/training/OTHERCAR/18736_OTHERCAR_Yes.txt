            We bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Limited after researching a number of comparable SUVs - including the Lexus RX300, The Acura MDX, The Dodge Durango, The Mercedes M Class, and the Toyota 4Runner. All are in the $30K+ category. Of all these the Jeep has the quietest ride, the most towing capacity, and the most standard options.

What we love about it is the absolutely stable handling and the ultra-smooth ride. Much has been made about the Lexus' and Mercedes' car-like ride. However, we could not tell the difference between the others and the Jeep. The Lexus and Mercedes are much smaller vehicles. The Jeep has very distinctive looks, while the other two look more like a minivan. There is nothing that we hate or dislike about the Jeep. It is loaded with options, including a ten-disc CD changer and a top-of-the-line audio system.

The Jeep is an expensive vehicle - fully loaded costing almost $35K. The one we bought is a V8 becuase we plan to tow a horse trailer. If you do not plan any towing then opt for the standard V6 and save about $2K. If you just need an SUV, instead of a car, then consider something like a Mazda Tribute or RAV-4. If you are looking at a Mercedes or Acura, seriously consider the Jeep.
