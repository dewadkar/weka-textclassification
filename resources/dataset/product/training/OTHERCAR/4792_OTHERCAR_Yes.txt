            I got this camera as a graduation gift a few months ago.  I love being outdoors and wanted a camera I didn't have to worry about but that could bring back excellent photos of my adventures.  The DC-5000 came through for me.

Feature Summary:
(*) 2.1 Megapixel camera for high quality prints up to 8x10
(*) USB for fast fast file transfer
(*) Compact Flash slot for memory (Kingston 64MB at Buy.comfor only $109
(*) 2X Optical Zoom / 3X digital zoom
(*) Rugged design

After getting my camera I went online and purchased some high capacity NiMh batteries and a charger and a 64MB CF card. Get the batteries and charger at Thomas Distributing (http://www.thomas-distributing.com/batteries.htm) and the camera and memory at Buy.com.  I have no connection to either;  they just have great prices and service.

 I can now take around 100 of the highest quality pictures several times before recharging the battery!  I am looking forward to ordering some prints online.  With a maximum resolution greater than 1600 x 1200, I expect to be able to print out some 8x10 photos no problem.

The only thing I need now is a completely waterproof case.  The DC-5000 is weatherproof which is great for almost everything, but isn't enough in the worst conditions.  The solution is the Aquapac (http://www.aquapac.net/cases.html).  It looks like everything I need, but unfortunately, the distributor for the U.S. is out of the style I want, so I haven't been able to try it.

The only drawbacks I have seen with this camera are that it only has 2X optical zoom (digital zoom is a waste of time - I can do that in photoshop) and that it is a little slow for some action shots.  

Overall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes (or needs) to take digital photos in the outdoors.
