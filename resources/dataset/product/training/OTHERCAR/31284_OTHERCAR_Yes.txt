            i have owned three, an 85, 84, and currently an 81.  i love them.  now, there were some made from 87 to i think 89 or 90, they have problems with carbon build up in the manifolds, and have poor engines, and i am NOT recommending them.  but 86 and before are great, and i assume the later models are just as good.  i have had a few friends who owned the later models, and they seemed pretty all right, but for me- the pre 87 is the only way to go.  the cars are dependable- getting you where you are going, even if it is slow and maybe not full of the commoditites one could ask for, but it will get you there.  they are good on gas, not always so great on oil :)  they are cheap to obtain, drive, and repair (if yuo feel necessary to fix anything, as even if stuff is broken it will probably last for at least another year or two- BUT I AM NOT SAYING IT IS OKAY TO BE DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE)  but anyway, they are great little cars- much better than any american or european late model car, and better than most of the other japanese cars.  toyotas are one of the most dependable and reliable cars, and they make excellent first, second, or even last car.  i love these little buggers, and i hope toyota will bring them back again, as they are the perfect little mode of motorized transportation.<br><br>
