            I got my 1991 Honda Accord 4 door from my grandmother so I knew it was well cared for.  I'm lucky in that regard.

But I'm also lucky that she had bought such an excellent car!  The car works beautifully, the gas mileage is still high after 10 years around 25-27, and it truly gets those numbers.  The interior was great for those of us who are short and female.  I was actually quite happy that this car doesn't come with an air bag because I sit so close to the steering wheel it would be more likely to cause harm than good.  

Some slight downers.  The radio/control panel is kinda hard to reach without taking your eyes off the road for a moment.  You can feel when the car shifts to a higher gear, it's not excessive but noticeable.  The car can have trouble starting in the summer heat -- in 2000 when New England was hit with a major heat wave, many earlier model Honda owners were breaking down and visiting dealerships with problems of starting up (including myself).  Also, if you attempt to pull the seats down to open up trunk space, the opening between the back seat and the trunk is partially blocked so something like a bike which fits in my sister's 1992 Honda Accord 2 door won't fit in my 1991 Honda Accord 4 door.

This car speaks of reliability though.  Look at the cars at a high school or college campus and you'll notice Honda's everywhere.  They last.  And I've noticed that this model, the 1991 Honda Accord, seems to be extremely popular.  I barely drive a day without seeing a car that looks exactly like mine.  The repair bill has been slightly over 500$ for the past five years I've had the car, nice and low.
