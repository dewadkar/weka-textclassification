            I took my car into the dealer because of an odd smell coming from the engine. The dealer told me that my head gasket went on the car. Oil all over the back of the engine and in parts of the engine. The story is that the gasket dried out. What I can't understand is that this car is only over a year old. I baby this car.

I had now multiple problems with the breaks. Bad calipers (twice) and warped roters. 

Don't get me wrong, I like the car but I can't believe that a NEW car can have so many problems.

Lots of new squeaks and odd sounds coming from the interior.

Low setting interior fan keeps blowing (3 times now). It was said to be the low setting fan risitor
