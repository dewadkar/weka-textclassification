            The 2000 Corolla was the best buy out there for what you got. This midsize car not only has a more powerful engine it has added many features that increase the durability of the car. 

The more powerful engine, the added CD player (etc) and the more comfortable seats are some of the pluses of this car.If you are more interested in the handling of the car this may not be your vehicle, however for most drivers it is good (at reasonable speeds).

The Corolla has a smooth ride and on the highway it performs like a sports car. The controls are in easy reach and driving for long trips are not painful like some of the earlier Corolla products.

If you are looking for a family car that is reliable, durable and modestly priced this is the car for you. This is truly the best car I have ever driven. <br><br>
