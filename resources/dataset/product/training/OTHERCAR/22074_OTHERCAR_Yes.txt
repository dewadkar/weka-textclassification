            I bought this camera because Kodak is a name I can trust, the camera had all the features I was looking for in an inexpensive digital camera, and the price was good.  I feel I received a great value for my dollar.

This product performs as good as higher priced cameras by other manufacturers.  My experience has been good.  I can use multiple settings to regulate the resolution of my pictures.  I can put a date stamp on each picture.  The Kodak DC-215 has a really easy to use preview feature so I can erase any picture that I don't like right away.  It has a zoom feature and a close-up setting that lets me get about 6 inches away from the thing I'm photographing.  

One of the other features I like is the little memory card that stores the images.  My camera came with a 4mg card &amp; I purchased an extra 16mg card.  This gives me a total of abut 88 pictures if I'm using the highest resolution settings.

One of the things I LOVE about this camera is the ability to use the LCD panel to focus on my subject.  With a regular camera, I'm always cutting off heads or feet or getting the subject way off to one side.  Since I can use the LCD display to view what I'm taking pictures of, I don't have those problems anymore.  

Another thing I like is the compact size of the camera.  When we were at Disneyland last year (1999) I could put it comfortably in my small shoulder bag - I didn't have to carry around a separate camera case.

So far, the only thing I don't like is the way the camera &quot;eats&quot; batteries.  Since I knew most digital cameras are hard on batteries, I purchased an extra set of rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.  On a trip, it can be awkward having to charge a set of batteries every night if I'm using the camera a lot.

I would strongly recommend the Kodak DC-215 to anyone purchasing a digital camera for the first time.  It gives quality pictures and is quite user-friendly.<br><br>
