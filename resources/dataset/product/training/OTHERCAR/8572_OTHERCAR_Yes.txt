            When I received my 1994 Pontiac Grand AM SE, I was thrilled. It had 17,000 miles on it, and I thought it was great. Little did I know what I was in store for. By the time I reached 40,000 I had already replaced most of my engine. The seats are uncomfortable and can only be bared for a few hours at a time. The angle of the seats make it hard for the driver to see the front of the car at times, and also make for a hard time while going in reverse. The shocks and struts were excellent...until I reached 50,000 miles. Now the car feels as though it is going to fall apart at the slightest bump. Overall I recommend this car to no one. After driving this car for the past four years I am ready to sell it and get a nice foreign car. Although I have always been pro-American cars, after this car, my mind has changed.
