            Well the Pontiac Aztek redefines and creates a new genre of vehicle. I was in the market for another van. I did all my research and my brain pointed me to the Toyota Sienna. Quality was the basis of the decision to buy the Sienna.

Funny thing happened on the way to the Toyota dealership. My decision was made and my wife and I were on our way to see Lou the Toyota sales guy who did a great job. Well as we drove past the Pontiac dealership there were bought 20 people around a car/suv/van/whatZit.

We stopped to see the cause of the commotion and were totally shocked by the AZTEK. We sat in it:

1. The interior was very well appointed. The fit and finish was excellent and I was surprised. I'm Canadian and we have somewhat of a bias vs. American cars cause of the quality problems of the past. I looked high and low could not find anything I did not like. The materials were fine quality..........in fact I test drove the Mercedes ML300. I had trouble finding a difference that would account for the price.

2. Wife liked it too......Test drive time. The test drive was great. It handled well cornered well and like the overall feel. Acceleration was not the Mercedes but every bit as quiet. Real quiet ride. Not the price of the Mercedes.

3. Sound system.........Pioneer 10.....yes 10 speaker sound system. Man I luv my tunes. Listened to Enya....Beatles...Kiss...on the test drive. It was listening to my Bang and Olaf in my living room. At this point I was sold.

4. We were gone on test drive for 1 hour without sales guy. (It was I second drive....first drive sales guy was with us). My wife said to pull into the mall and go through the vehicle. Well we pulled in ...had every door open ...hood...rear...4 doors.

Well we had at least 10 people stop and look at it. Everyone thought it was the coolest....(Poor Lou the Toyota Sales guy). Nothing like other people tellin ya how cool the vehicle you want to buy is.

CRISIS:  All the research...Toyota Quality.....Hmmmmmmmmmm....never mind.

I'm the proud owner of the wild and crazy Aztek. Bought the camping unit....What a vehicle.

I can honestly say ..I would luv BMW x5...or Mercedes ML300 or that Lexus SUV......but dollar for dollar . I think I got the coolest most versatile vehicle on the market.

AS for the UGLY factor.  I never liked vanilla ice cream, white bread orthe homogenized tastes of the masses. Aztek scratches the itch to be different....Something Sienna could not do!!

Sorry Lou......but my Black Aztek Beast is JUST TOOOO FUN!!!<br><br>
