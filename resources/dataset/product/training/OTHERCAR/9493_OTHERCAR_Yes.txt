              I had owned just about every pickup other than Dodge prior to purchasing my 1500 Quad Cab 4X4 Sport.  At this time I can only give the facts on the vehicle based on driving it for 9 months and 13,000 miles.  So far, other than replacing the cheapest set of wiper blades known to man, I've encountered no problems.  It rides like a big luxury car.  It is very quiet when driven at freeway speeds and has a very solid feel on the road.  Mine has the 360 cid V8 and it does suck gas like there's no tomorrow.  It has been a great tow vehicle for my boat and comes with a factory trailer hitch with the package group that I got.  The interior front is roomy enough for a big dude like myself to drive on long trips without getting leg cramps.  The interior rear is suitable for children or adults under 5'8&quot; tall.  We have packed 6 people in the truck without much trouble.  The interior features blow Ford and Chevy away with features like a very nice factory 6 speaker CD player, heated mirrors and a combination arm rest/work station in the 40/20/40 front seat.  Also included in the interior are 4 very handy cup holders, a steering wheel mounted cruise control system, delay wipers, a power outlet, CD storage and a big ashtray with lighter.  The gauges are easy to read and the controls are all within reach and easy to use.  I also feel that the interior just plain looks better than that of Ford and Chevy.  The exterior has some nice features also with both front and rear step bumpers, fog lamps and plenty of tie-down spots in the bed.  The engine compartment has all the fluid fills and checks within easy reach.

  Okay, here's the best thing of all, the price.  Mine did not come with every factory option but does have a lot of extras.  It came in just under $25,000.  Not bad considering that the Fords and Chevys that I priced with similar equipment were running between $28,500 and $31,000.  I feel its the best value out there.<br><br>
