            <b>Well...here goes!  I've not written a review in a very long time, and we did just add a third child to our mix, so we needed something different and more up to date!  
We were driving an older <i>Chevy conversation van</i> and loved it!  It had lots of room and storage space, but we wanted to look into a SUV.  Having two car seats is not an easy thing to stuff into any car let alone trying to find room for an older child to fit in as well.  We went to our local Spitzer dealer, and you know how you go through all that rig-a-ma-roll, how much do you want to spend, what are you looking in to, salesman talk, blah blah blah...we had spotted a nice silver <i>Durango</i>.  It was a 1999, but to us, it looked brand new!  The seats in front are nice bucket kind, and there's a hide-away console in between the seats.  This particular SUV has the 4x4, 4 wheel drive package, which to me was not a major point scorer, but my hubby went nuts!  (side note, we live in Cleve, where is he REALLY gonna use it??? LOL)  It has power everything and very nicely equipped. 
The middle row of seats are not quite bench, because there is a middle section that pulls down and has two cup holders on the underside, nice, but not useful to us.  The third row (some don't come with this option) is very small.  The seat is about 2/3 the size of a regular seat, example-the middle seat.  But nice enough to sit extra children.  The back hatch was roomy as well.  Not a ton of storage space, but would work for our needs.  The passenger side has an air bag, that can not be turned off, so we can only have another adult sit in front.  And it came with a magnum V8, again, something my hubby went nuts over!  All starry eyed, we went in to make the deal.  Looked good to us, but we kind of bought this on a whim...didn't do too much thinking ahead of time, nor any research on the vehicle at all!  (wrong answer, some of you are saying, huh?)  Anyway, we ended up buying the SUV and taking it home that day!  Yahhooooo, we've got a new car!  The down side!  Here we go...there is not nearly enough room between the two car seats to have our 7 year old CRAWL over either side to get to that middle section, in between the two baby seats!  Yikes, hadn't thought of that!  Next, you can't get anyone into the third row, because, you guessed it, you'd have to remove the baby seats to be able to fold up the seat in order for someone to climb back there!  OK, we are involved in a car pool for school, we pick up two other children...hmmm, how are we gonna solve this problem of no climbing over people to get to a seat with a seat belt?  You can't.  So, we decided to put one of the car seats in the back row.  That worked, great problem solved!  Until the child that's sitting back there gets out, I turned the corner and my son was telling me, "Mommy, I sideways".  I'm looking in my rear view mirror, and lo' and behold, he's strapped in, lying on the seat, the whole car seat had tipped over!  The bench seat being smaller, won't hold a standard car seat, it's not wide enough!  So, no more car pooling, anyway, that's my problem with it!  The other thing we hadn't looked in to was the gas mileage.  It only gets 13 miles to the gallon in the city and 17 miles to the gallon on the highway!  Good thing it's a "pleasure" vehicle for us! Bottom line, make sure you check, really check in to things before you buy, and if you have special circumstances, make sure the vehicle will "work" for you!  All said and done, we paid $19,000 for a 1999 <i>Dodge Durango</i>.  Last note, it really does not drive like a car, it's very strange, you don't notice the differences until you actually drive it for awhile!  Hope this helps someone!!  Thanks for reading!
