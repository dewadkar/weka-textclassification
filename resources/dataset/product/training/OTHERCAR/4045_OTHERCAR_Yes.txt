            The Chevrolet Tahoe is an excellent choice for a mid-sized family Suv. The Tahoe seats up to five people with room to spare. The only problem with the amount of space in the back.The Tahoe gives each person in the back seat is somewhat small for large or tall people. In other areas of design, the Tahoe beats other competitors hands down. It is small and agile with excellent steering response especially with the larger disc brakes. The length does not impede any kind of movement since the Tahoe feels like it can turn on a dime. The comfort and compatibility make this the number one choice for Sport Utility Vehicles out on the market today. This is shown in the excellent sound system, air conditioning, electric seats, heated seats, large cargo area and etc. The only cons for this marvelous vehicle is of the aforementioned small seating and doors in the back seat and the head lights that only turn off when the key is pulled out of the ignition. Otherwise, this is the best vehicle on the road for someone thinking of upgrading from a car to the best SUV on the road.<br><br>
