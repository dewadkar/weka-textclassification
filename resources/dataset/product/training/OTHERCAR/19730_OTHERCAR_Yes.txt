            Mercedes-Benz 420SEL
Grade: A

My mother owns a 1986 420SEL (and by virtue, so do I, but don�t tell her I said so�hehehe) in Smoke Silver, which essentially is almost like light beige, and with a dark brown leather interior with zebrano wood trim.  She has owned this car for four years or so now, and there haven�t been any major problems with it.  Our particular example was an immaculate car owned by a wealthy woman who paid $65,000 <i>in cash</i> in 1985 to get it with all available options, including the car phone, which was pricey at the time, to say the least.  She pampered the car as it deserved to be, and for that reason my mother was able to fulfill her dream to own a great Benz� all at the low initial cost of about $12,000.

I love Benzes.  To me, they represent the apex of status, luxury, engineering, and performance.  Even the oh-so-solid sound of slamming the door sounds and feels precise and, well, just so <i>right</i>.  Whereas many other makes and models feel like they were made of thousands of parts, panels, bolts, and so on, a finely-crafted Mercedes-Benz, particularly the S-Class, gives you the impression that it was carved from a single block of steel.  The 4.2-liter V8 supplies more than adequate power for this almost two-ton car (also available for not much more is the 560SEL, the flagship of the time, with its huge 5.6-liter V8, heated front seats, and power rear seats). Acceleration is instant and effortless, even at high speeds.  This car is <i>silent</i>: inside you hear nothing, and outside you hear a unique, low �hiss� thanks to the precision-tuned muffler (at first, I thought it was a pressure leak!).  At idle, it really doesn�t even sound like a gasoline engine.  Another random note: the SEL designation (as opposed to SE) denotes the longer, more elegant wheelbase option, even though in my book, you should think of it as a necessity.

Inside, you are treated to a living room on 16-inch alloy wheels.  The model year 1986 meant an update for the S-Class, with less chrome usage externally, but larger engines (380 and 500 models turned into 420 and 560, respectively) and a better dashboard console.  If there�s one thing that I never liked about older Benzes up to that point, it�s how rudimentary the stereo and air conditioning controls look in comparison to the rest of the dashboard.  To me, they really were almost an eyesore.  1986 revisions changed that, and the result is a much more unified look and feel.  Supple leather and luxurious real wood covers the entire interior, including the firmly supportive, yet comfortable, front and rear seats.  Power seat controls are manipulated through a little representation of the seat in the door panel; slide the seat forward, and your actual seat reacts the same way. Push the little headrest up, and yours does too.  This logical system has been emulated in several cars by other manufacturers in recent years.  The interior is <i>cavernous</i>; rear legroom is never at a premium, even when I�m sitting behind my 6�4�, 300lb+ uncle.  The sound system represents the best of the era, with a pullout Sony digital AM/FM/cassette receiver featuring Dolby B/C noise reduction (most tape decks <i>today</i> don�t have Dolby C) and CD changer controls.

If I had to point out some drawbacks, they would all stem from unavoidable costs incurred along the way.  Don�t buy this car if you aren�t prepared to cover these various expenses.  Massachusetts is a state with mandatory auto insurance requirements, so getting Option 1 insurance on a 420SEL while living in Boston is no pocket change.  It�s gotten to the point where my mother had to take out a $500 deductible on the policy in order to drop the monthly rate (and remove me from the additional driver coverage list�what a shame).  These babies only drink Premium fuel�don�t even think about anything lower than 93 octane (don�t give into your urges to go with the cheaper Regular Unleaded, even in these times of inflated gas prices; it�s not worth ruining your engine!).  Our 420SEL used to cost about $40 to fill�<b>before</b> the price increase.  If you ever need to get your Benz towed, a flatbed is required, not just a wrecker; I�ve had so many problems with ignorant tow truck dispatchers taking all afternoon only to send the wrong truck, that if it happens again I�ll probably go insane.  Also, because the only places that I would recommend bringing a car like this for service are Benz/BMW/Porsche/Audi dealerships (Herb Chambers Motorcars for me), you pay <b>exorbitant</b> amounts for routine procedures.  For instance, they recommend a $1500 tune-up every 5,000 miles.  Considering the 50-mile daily commute my mother makes, that�s about 2-3 times a year!  At least they wash/wax it and give you S-Class shuttle service or an E-Class loaner� and a free apple. Hooray!

Oh, there are a few quirks about driving a 420SEL, besides the typical big-car understeer.  Benzes around this age tend to have a peculiar feel to the accelerator, whereas it doesn�t start to go until depressed halfway, then it takes off like a rocket.  When switching between cars, this can take a little getting used to.  Also, a byproduct of the almost-too-smooth ride is that at high speeds you literally feel like you are floating.  This type of numb ride is acceptable, even desired and appreciated, when cruising, but on interstates this can be a bit too relaxed, causing over-acceleration if you aren�t careful.

All in all, there is no equal in my eyes for the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.  If you ask anyone for their idea of the definitive luxury automobile (or �luxury-liner� according to my mother), most will invariably agree with me in indicating the venerable Benz.  Everyone should be as lucky as I have been to drive one.  The car of your dreams might not be out of your reach after all!
