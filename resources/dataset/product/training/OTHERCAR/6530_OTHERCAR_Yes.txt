               At first I was not with the idea of buying this car.  But after we passed through the used car parking lot sale, I decided to go and get this car.  I like it because it really has not given me any major problems.  The only time I have ever taken this car to the shop was for minor problems such as flats, and things that I caused for carelessness.  
  When I bought the car, it had 129,034 miles.  I have had it for two years now and it has 145,352 miles and it still runs great!  I go everywhere with it and feel really comfortable with it.  
   I like it because it is not to big and it is not to small.  Even though  mine has four doors, I still feel sort of sporty with it.  I recommend this car to anybody who wants a reliable car.  
    What I do not like about it is that it does not have a tape or cd player.  It is very hard to find an audio player that will fit the car!  If anybody knows where I can find this particular part for my car, please let me know:)
