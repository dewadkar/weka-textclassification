            I have had better luck with my Galant than others here.  I have the ES with the nicely powered V6.  This car is a rocket off the line compared to others in its class.  So far after 16,000 miles I've had no trouble with my transmission that others have mentioned.  The new exterior design is fantastic change over the old style and apparently much safer as well as seen by one of the nightly news programs that had crash tested many cars.

The interior I find to be quite comfortable, even on longer trips.  There is a lot of plastic as one might expect in the under $20,000 range but all controls are laid out well and within easy reach.  The faux wood trim throughout the dash is actually quite attractive.  The seats are comfortable but the fabric design is a little to be desired.  The trunk space is quite adequate and I'm able to cram quite a bit into it when need.  One of the rear seats pulls down for access into the trunk which I found to be great, especially when trying to put skis in the car. 

 Interior space overall can be a little cramped for 4 adults, you would not want have more than that for any length of time.  I have the standard stereo in my car which sounds exactly that...standard.  The power is quite nice and has plenty for pulling off the line or passing on dreaded two lane highways.

This car overall is a keeper for me.  It has looks, power, and comfort.<br><br>
