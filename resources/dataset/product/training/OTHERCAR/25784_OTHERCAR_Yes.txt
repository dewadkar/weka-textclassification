            My 93 Nissan Altima was the first car I had ever purchased on my own, and it was probably the best decision I ever made. For roughly $19,000 new, with Sport Package, this car has served me well. Not only is it a good daily driver, it's also fun to go all out with it. For an I4 with some 160 horsepower or so, it performs as well as the '92 V6 Toyota Camry. I cannot emphasize enough how versatile this car was; it could take me to work, and also served well for performance driving. Although it wasn't exactly the fastest car to drive around, it negotiated corners very easily, and although some oversteer does occur, it comes out of it seamlessly. I had to replace the engine after a staggering 230,000 miles on the car, and that was the only major reconditioning I've ever needed on the car. It still runs great; air conditioning is cold, all electronics work, but the only problem is the sunroof. It doesn't open all the way, and only tilts upward now, but I never use it much anyways so I never bothered to get that fixed. All in all, an extremely fun car to drive, especially aggressively since it's an easy car to slide around, and very reliable indeed.
