            I am not a professional photographer, nor do I claim to be one.  However, I enjoy casually taking pictures and sharing them with friends and family.  So, after settling down in my freshman year at college, I decided it was time for me to expand my photographic options and venture into the world of digital photography.

Being a college student, I had a relatively tight budget, and so I wanted a camera that was under $200.  I searched for around a week on the Internet for reviews of cheap and easy-to-use cameras, finally deciding on the FujiFilm FinePix 1300 camera.  (A few great sites for digital camera reviews are http://www.dcresource.com and http://www.imaging-resource.com.)   The following reasons highlight why I chose the FinePix 1300 over its competition, mainly Canon's PowerShot series and Nikon's CoolPix series:

1. Price: I found my FinePix 1300 for $115 (s/h and tax included) through Dell's website (http://www.dell.com).  At the time of my purchase, around September 2001, they were running a 10% off all digital cameras deal.  Canon's PowerShot A10 had similar features, but was $50-100 more expensive, and Nikon's CoolPix was similarly priced to the A10.

2. Ease of Use: The FinePix 1300 is a point-and-shoot camera, meaning there is no need to manually adjust focus, aperture, and shutter speed.  It is possible, however, to adjust these settings under a manual mode included in the camera's menu options.  Its ease of use was great, though, because I was mainly taking pictures of friends and special events where I didn't need any "fancy" photography ï¿½ all I needed was the click of a button.  I didn't need the extra features included with the other cameras for the extra price.

3. Display and menu: The FinePix 1300 features a 1.6" LCD screen to help guide its user to take pictures.  The screen helps immensely with accurate positioning and is much easier to use than the standard looking lens.  The 1.6" is a decent size, however subjects the screen can sometimes appear rather dark and hard to see.  The camera's on-screen menu is easy to use and contains settings for flash, focus, date & time, and other features.  It also includes a very helpful 10 second auto-timer, perfect for those shots in which an extra photographer is not available.

4. Size: The FinePix 1400 weighs only 8.4 oz with batteries.  It features a compact design and fits in most jeans pockets and purses.

5. Image quality: For a 1.3 megapixel camera, the FinePix 1300's images are pretty sharp.  The camera supports both 640 X 480 and 1280 X 960 resolutions (I recommend using the latter) and its images are generally distortion-free, and its ability to precisely match colors is pretty good.

The camera, however, is not without flaws.  If you plan on purchasing this (or any) digital camera, plan on spending an extra $20-30 for a battery recharger and a set of rechargeable batteries.  I bought the Energizer CHM24 at Best Buy (http://www.bestbuy.com) for $24.99, I believe.  Taking pictures eats up battery life quite quickly, especially with the LCD screen and flash on.  The FinePix 1300's website (http://www.fujifilm.co.uk/fujidc/fp1300/) advertises that 4 AA batteries can "last for a maximum of about 400 shots with the flash used half the time and the LCD monitor off," but this is deceptive, as the camera is a lot more fun with the LCD on and a flash is almost always needed.

Also, the lack of zoom (a 2X digital zoom is included, but this is merely a mimic of a computer's "Zoom in" feature when displaying photos) is a real haphazard to an otherwise pretty amazing camera.  The reason the zoom was not included is almost certainly to keep the price down, so this tradeoff is rather reasonable.  However, not having a zoom can be annoying at points and make certain photos impossible or flawed.

Thirdly, wih 1.3 megapixels, the camera's images are not as sharp as some of its higher-priced competitors, which offer 2.5+ megapixels.  The images, as stated earlier, are clear, but I wouldn't recommend printing anything larger than a 4 X 6 or a 5 X 7.     

The camera includes a 8MB SmartMedia card, which holds anywhere from 12-48 images on the 1280 X 960 setting, depending on the image quality setting.  I use the medium setting which gives me 24 images on the 8MB card.

Overall, I would recommend this camera for beginners and non-professional, casual photographers.  Don't pay anything more than $125 for it though, and look around for a great price on the Internet.  This model has been discontinued by Fuji, but don't let that discourage you from purchasing this.  It still remains a great camera.
