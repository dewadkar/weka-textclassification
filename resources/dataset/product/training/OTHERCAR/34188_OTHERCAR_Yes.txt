            I fell in love with this car on the first test drive.  I was originally looking for a Sport Utility, but was put off by the gas guzzling and the lack of stability, so then I switched to Wagons.  Did you know that the Passat Wagon has more cargo space than a Jeep Grand Cherokee.

I mainly looked at the Volvo V40 and the VW Passat as they are both in the same price range.  The bottom line was that you got more bang for you buck with the VW.

Pros:
1) Lots of Cargo space, I was moving at the time I bought this and it came in really handy for moving stuff around.  Make note of the easy slide in/out feature in the trunk.  Some wagons have a lip that you have to lift object over in order to get them back out, can be tough on the back if it's heavy.

2) The GLX comes fully loaded (except I had to pay extra for the 6CD changer).  Fully loaded = 
 - Power seats - programmable to each key.  We have 2 keys, 1 each.  Get this, when I unlock the car with my key (keyless entry) when I open the drivers door the seat automatically moves into my position ... neat or what!  They are right on with those VW commercials!
 - Climate control - just set the temperature and you're all set
 - Heated seats
 - Leather 
 - Monsoon sound system
 - Rain detecting windshield wipers - in intermittent mode the wipers detect when there is rain on the windows and adjust the frequency accordingly.
 - Rearview mirror that dims when exposed to bright lights (the headlights of the person behind you)
 - Cruise control
 - ABS
 - Electric rearview mirrors - heated, fold in to the car at the flip of a switch for parking, also this feature that changes the position of the passenger side mirror when you put the transmission in reverse - useful for parking.
 - Maybe more that I can't think of - this model rocks!

3) Smooth, powerful engine.  When you really need the power just put the pedal to the metal and this car will perform for you.  Also, the tiptronic gear shifting is fun, especially if you want to be in control as you race out of the gate.  Even smoother when it's loaded up with lots of cargo.  The tiptronic system allows you to take control of the gear shifting, it will change automatically if you forget when it hits the red line, and it downshifts automatically as you're slowing down.

Cons:
1) Had a problem with the air bag in the passenger seat which required maintenance.  One night when we got home I moved the passenger seat all the way forward and then the car filled with smoke, apparently a wire had shorted.  Was covered under warranty though, and I was provided with a rental car during the work.

2) The Cup holders are THE WORST I have seen in any car.  A McDonalds size cup is about the limit.  Very shallow wells don't provide much support for the cups.

Comparison between Passat Wagon and Volvo V40
1) Passat has A LOT more space than Volvo.
2) Passat has more powerful engine.
3) Passat is easier to load in trunk.
4) Volvo has better cup holders than Passat.

The Volvo V70 is definitely better than the Passat and I would have bought that if it had been the same price :)

Overall a great car, I'm really happy with my purchase.<br><br>
