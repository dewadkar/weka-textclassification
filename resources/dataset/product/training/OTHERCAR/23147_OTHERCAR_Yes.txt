            I purchased my 1995 chevy tracker about a year ago. I was used to driving large trucks but thought I would give a smaller vehicle a try. When I first drove this vehicle I felt like I was in a golf cart. I was close to the steering wheel, and windshield. It was just SO small. It took me quite awhile to get used to it, and even longer to really like it. However, I found through my year of driving it that it is VERY reliable. I haven't had a bit of trouble with it, and I drive it about 75 miles a day. I also enjoy the great gas mileage of the smaller vehicle. I also found that the soft top made for a great variety, and summer fun.
   I would recommend this vehicle for the younger single consumer. The great gas mileage makes for a cheaper travel vehicle, however the lack of passenger, and luggage space makes travel with a large family difficult. I also found it difficult to get a child seat in and out of the backseat. Great college vehicle, or the like.<br><br>
