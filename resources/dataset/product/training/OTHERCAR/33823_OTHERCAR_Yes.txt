            I have worked with it during more than two years, taking hundreds of pictures. It is not a new camera, so the resolution is not the highest, but it is enough for most applications.

I use it in family happenings, trips and also in my job and many of the pictures have been used in the website of the engineering consulting company where I work. Some of them were proofs in multi million dollars decisions by regulatory boards.

The metallic body makes it one of the strongest and the zoom capabilities, capacity of the storage card, high precision optic lenses and size make it good for any application.

Th flash works fine but the red eye reduction is not the best. The battery charge can be exhausted without notice because there is not a level meter.

It is possible to adjust size and resolution to get from simple pictures to send by e-mail to detailed photos that can be printed with good details.

There is some delay after pressing the button to take the picture that is not good in some cases because you must anticipate the moment.

I paid a high price because I bought it in my country (Colombia) and the import taxes are terrible.
