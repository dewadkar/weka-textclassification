            The Grand Am has always been an affordable vehicle. With the new advertising campaign, Pontiac/GM is sure to sell a lot more this year. We decided to purchase the Grand Am over the rest of the cars in its class because of the spacious room and the price. I am 6'3&quot; so the fact that I am able to sit in the front AND the back was a big plus.  I see and hear negative feedback about a lot of vehicles but that can be attributed to laziness.  Some people expect a car to take care of itself.  They wonder why the paint fades when they leave it outside for 2 years.  They wonder why the transmission needed repairs after they failed to check the transmission fluid or at least took it to a place to have it checked.  There is still maintenance involved with owning a car that many people neglect.  Owning a car can not be considered an investment because you will lose money the moment you drive it off the lot.  So at least help the car retain its value and attempt to help slow its depreciation by maintaining it properly whether you do it yourself or have a service shop do it.  

Back on the subject of the Pontiac Grand Am, we purchased it in June and it now has 7200 miles on it. My fiancee drives it back and forth to work and we drive it on weekend getaways. The car has considerable pickup both starting out and on the highway. I feel safe knowing that if my fiancee or myself need to speed up for any reason, we will be able to rather quickly. The car's handling is not that of a Porsche, but can corner on a whim and is very responsive. 

For the money, the Pontiac Grand Am is a very good choice. It makes a great car for anyone from college students, to graduates, to middle-aged all the way to senior citizens. It is a rather large car compared to the majority of the cars on the road today so if you are unfortunate enough to be involved in a collision, you will be well protected with it's large body and frame, side impact prevention and dual air bags. I would recommend this car to anyone. It will do everything you expect from a car for a reasonable price. Take advantage of GM's (&quot;Generous Motors&quot;) financing and its low APR %. Two thumbs up and 5 stars.
