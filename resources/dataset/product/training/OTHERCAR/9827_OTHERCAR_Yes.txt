            It really pains me that this excellent car may no longer be produced soon. I have absolutely no idea how its competition could be outselling it. The look, performance, and price of the Camaro is a package that simply can't be matched by any other car in my opinion. 

I bought this car new in 1997 and it has impressed me every day since. My particular Camaro is powered by a 3800 V-6. Yes, I know that the Z28 and SS are faster, but in 1997 the LT1 V-8 in those cars was about to be replaced by the newer and better LS1 V-8. I don't like to buy a car only to have it outdated a few months later, so I chose to take the economical route and got the coupe with black paint, charcoal leather, and chrome rims. I believe that the 1997 Camaro may be the best looking Camaro ever overall. The interior was updated that year, but the recessed headlights similar to 80's Camaros remained. I don't care much for the 70's like headlights on 1998 - present Camaros. I would have liked an LS1 V-8 in my car, but the 3800 V-6 has proved to be excellent. Its 200 horsepower may not sound like much, but the engine has a flat torque band that virtually stays at its 225 lb maximum. That, combined with the lighter weight of the V-6 engine makes for a car that is quicker that you'd think. With only a few easy modifications my car has beaten more than one Mustang GT at the drag strip. More importantly, my car has been a totally reliable and comfortable daily driver for me. Granted, I'm only 20, and older people think the car is too hard to get in and out of. My only complaint would have to be the tires. My car came with touring tires that aren't nearly sporting enough and hydroplane easily. Can't wait to replace them.
