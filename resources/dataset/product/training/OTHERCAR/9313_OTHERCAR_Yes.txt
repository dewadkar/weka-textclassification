            If you want a car that is the envy of anyone who knows ANYTHING about automobiles, and that makes driving feel like floating over the asphalt with 320 horses pulling you along, this is the right car for you.  The Supra is Toyota at its height of engineering.  With a 3.0, twin cam, 6 cylinder, twin turbo under the hood you will never be left behind, unless of course you mistake the gas pedal for the brake or something stupid like that.  This car is the sweetest looking on the road today, with a huge rear spoiler and smooth, curvy lines, everyone will turn heads to see who is driving down the road.  The 17&quot; wheels that come standard with the supra turbo are beautiful.  All the guys that like to go out and buy an new Civic or Integra and load it with aftermarket kits and upgrades don't have to bother here.  The Supra has already achieved perfection, there is no need for modifications here unless you plan to race.  If you do turn this monster into a racing machine you already have a solid base to start from.  

Ever since I first saw the Toyota Supra, I knew that I would own one, I kinda like to be the center of attention and with this awesome vehicle, I don't need to rely on my wit and charm to do it.<br><br>
