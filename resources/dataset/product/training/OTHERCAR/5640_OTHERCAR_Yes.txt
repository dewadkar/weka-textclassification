            I've driven three different models, done plenty of research, and ordered one for myself.  Here are a few learnings.

Which Model?
The AWD version comes with lots of compromises.  Considerably smaller gas tank, the worst gas mileage of the three, higher cost, low-power engine only, automatic transmission only.  Too many strikes, unless you're the sort that thinks AWD can cure whatever ails you.

The base unit has a decent 5-speed with great gas mileage, or an automatic.  Probably the ship of choice for most folks.  5th gear has limited acceleration; I'd worry that the optional big wheels and tires might make it sluggish.

The GT has the more powerful engine, a different axle ratio (favors performance over economy), and a 6-speed manual only.  The engine performs similarly to the base engine through most of the range, but at 6000 RPM to 8000 RPM the acceleration really kicks in.  Most folks will rarely drive in that range, but it sure is fun.  The 6-speed takes some getting used to -- expect some training time with the stiff selector, and don't wander through neutral or you'll get lost.  Is it worth the extra cost and a lifetime of premium gas, as well as a gas mileage hit?  For me, I couldn't resist.

Options Options.
There are some strange exclusions among options.  For example, you can't get the 17-inch wheels with the moonroof.  As best I can deduce, the extra two speakers of the 6-speaker stereo steal some space from the rear wheelwells.  The spendy navigation system with upgraded speakers has the same problem.

Most of the paint colors are boring.  The standard car comes with a considerable amount of black trim (mirrors, door handles, window frames, roof rack, etc) and even more gray plastic around the bumpers and lower sides.  Personally, I think the two different trim colors look cheap together.  A few colors (black/gray/white) offer a $500 option of painting the lower trim to match, but these are the colors that look best with the gray trim!  The other colors presumably don't stick as well to the plastic, but why not offer an option of black-painted trim, to unify all the trim?  Or just change the plastic trim to black.  What about it Pontiac, my car first?

Roomy?
I'm 6-foot-4-inches, and the Vibe has excellent driver space, so long as you avoid the moonroof -- like so many such roofs, it robs considerable headroom and puts a hard corner directly above a tall person's head.  There are some second-order complaints for a tall driver:  push the seat all the way back and the stickshift is too far away.  Lower the seat as required for headroom and the center console interferes with the right elbow.  The footrest is a bit too near.  So they made the space, but didn't get the details to go with it.  With the driver's seat all the way back there is marginal legroom in back, but this is on par with other cars this size and many larger ones.

Price?
  Order one and wait (currently 2 months) and you can save some bucks, especially if your company qualified for the GM "supplier" discount that expires in September.
