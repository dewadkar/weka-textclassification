            My last car was a brand-new 1995 Ford Mustang.  I've been a Ford-guy since before I was old enough to drive.  Yeah, I've owned other brands but none really stood up to the standards that I expected until I bought a (used) Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.  

Living in the South, we do not expect a lot of bad weather in the winter, but when we get snow, it is really important to be able to get around.  Driving the Grand Cherokee gives me a comfort level that I never experienced before.  After driving a Mustang, I was very surprised at how well it handles, especially on wet roads!  The Cherokee's handling is comparable to a sports car, and it is much more comfortable.

I did have some trouble adjusting to the controls, mostly positioning, but they are easy to reach and the icons are very clear.  The only real complaints that I've had is that the rear windshield wiper needed a tension adjustment to clear the window completely, the electronics in the sunroof could use some adjustment, I would like to get better gas mileage and the fan will not come on until the engine has warmed up.

All in all, I am very happy with my Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited!  I would recommend it for anyone who expects to have to cope with bad weather, poor road conditions, or who just likes to get out in the rough once in a while.  If you are looking for a daily ride, and have a long commute, you will not like the mileage you get... or rather, don't get.  At 55-65 mph, I average 18.7 mpg, driving &quot;city&quot;, it's more like 14-16 mpg.<br><br>
