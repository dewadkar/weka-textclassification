            I have had a manual Ion 1 for about 3 weeks now.  It is true that the interior material isn't very good and the seats are quite basic, but it is not UNcomfotable to drive around in this car.  I actually really like everything about the dashboard, it is sloped downward which creates a spacious feel and nice look.  On a downside, the interior is not very functional for storage compartments and cubby holes to put cds, sunglasses, pens, ect.  The smaller sized steering wheel has been critisized as gokart-like, but I don't think this aspect of the car is a very big deal one way or the other. 
The suspension is very nice, it has been reviewed well by professional car critics.  5th gear performs particularly well also....these two positives combined create a good highway experience.  The car easily handles high speeds, going about 80mph at only 3,000RPMS.  Some small cars feel like they are about to rattle and bust apart at high speeds, but the Ion is very smooth in this department. Perhaps this is owed to the 140 horsepower.  Through the lower gears engine power is always decent or better, but the car does not always provide a super refined feel.  The engine also sometimes has a somewhat unrefined sound to it.  My Ion is black, and I think the outside appearance is a strong point.
Value-wise, Saturns are cheap to insure and to repair and the Ion has good gas mileage.  They are also a safe car.  The low price and good rebates/financing with Saturn allowed me to buy new instead of used, which is a big plus.  This car isn't anything revolutionary, but the Ion could be a good choice for a lot of us.
