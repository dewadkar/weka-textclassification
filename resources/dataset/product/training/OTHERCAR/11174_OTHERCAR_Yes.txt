            I own a 1966 Buick Skylark. This car has been around for 34 years, and is still running like a dream. Of course, like every car, it has had it's occasional problems. The car, well, tank really, is a dark dark green in color. It has 15&quot; wheels with spinners (factory). If you don't know what it looks like, just imagine a '66 Chevy Impala. That is basically what mine looks like.

Under the hood, well, it looks like a mess. It has a 340 V8 engine in it. Everything under the hood is original. Now, normally that would be a bad thing, but in my case, it fits me just fine. As long as the car gets me where I need to go, I'm happy. And the 340 gets me there in a hurry. I have won many races with this car. Of course, make sure there's no pigs around before you take off.

If you ever had the chance to buy an old car like this, go for it. The old cars are built for speed. With a little work, you can have heads turning.<br><br>
