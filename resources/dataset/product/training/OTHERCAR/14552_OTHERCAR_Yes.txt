            I have purchased this vehicle about 2 years ago for $600. It has been in a minor accident at a time, but I quickly fixed it myself as all of the damage was done to left front fender and front bumper, items that are easily replaceable. At the time I only had 1 car and had to share it with my wife. Since then I purchased 1998 Mitsubishi Galant and 1995 Chevy S-10, reviews on which you can also find here on Epinions.com. I still own it, but majority of the time, my dad drives it.

It is diesel car, with 1.6 liter 55 horsepower engine. I don't know about today's diesel engines because they have a lot of electronics and kazilion sensors installed on them, but old diesel engines were the most reliable engines in the world. Before I purchased this car, the previous owner told me that odometer on it broke three months before he put it up for sale, and at a time it had 195 000 miles on it. I've been driving it for 2 years ever since, driving on average 25000 miles per year and did not have a single problem with it. One thing, and probably most important thing you have to remember about the old diesel engines, is that they require you to drain water from the fuel filter periodically, otherwise they tend to have rough starts, and work erratically until you do.

Overall cabin comfort is pretty good, as for 1985 car. Controls are minimum, but all the necessary features are there and well laid out. One bad thing to mension about the interior is plastic headliner - with time it tends to rattle and starts to peel off in the corners. Seats are firm, but very unsupportive; you basically have to hold on to the door handles on the sharp turns, otherwise you might fly off the seat. That is true only about the front seats though.

Transmission is mixed emotions. It shifts very smoothly, and it is still using factory clutch (original, that came with the car!!!! Talk about quality!). On the other hand, those of you that drive VWs with manual transmissions know that in order to shift into reverse, you have to press the shifter down, then move it to the front, as if you shift into first gear. Well, that little spring that lets you press the shifter down, tends to wear off with time, and when it does, you might unknowingly shift into first gear instead of reverse and vice versa. It is not the case though after you get used to it, since I just tend to lift the shifter up before shifting into first, and it don't bother me no more.

Over the whole period of me owning this car, I only spent money on regular maintenance (changing oil, replacing air and fuel filters). It has been an amazingly reliable car. I had to purchase parts once, to replace the fender and bumper that were damaged from the accident, and those parts were fairly easy to find. But from my conversations with other owners of the Golf, it could be quite a challenge to find parts for it.
