            First of all, before I get too far into this review, I would like to say I have never driven it. I know it sounds quite weird for me to be writing it, but it's my dad's and I have been in it many times. I think I've been in it enough to write a very helpful review (I hope). 

My dad had a 1990 Pontiac 6000LE. There was a spring poking into my dad's butt so he had to put a pillow on the seat, the car was rusting, there was loads of paint that got peeled off, and the heater didn't work very well. So needless to say, he decided to upgrade. Of course, he came to me for a few automobile suggestions. We looked at the Chrysler Intrepid (which was unimpressive) and the Jeep Grand Cherokee (which was nice but was pretty loud). One day the Maxima popped into my head. I told my dad that we needed to look at it and eventually did. 

We went to a dealership and started looking. My dad finally decided between two of them. A fully loaded (sun roof, traction control, ABS, etc.) 1999 Maxima GLE or a 2001 GXE. We both liked the GLE (I hate the rear lights on the 2001) and decided to go for it. It's been great so far. 

I will now go into detail about it... 

Engine: 
The twin cam aluminum 3.0-Litre V6 produces a very smooth ride. The gears shift nicely and theres enough power for a North American driver. We haven't had any problems with its engine. It's definitely an upgrade from the 6000LE. 

Audio System: 
Being 15, this is a part of the car I would've changed if I designed the car. It's 120 watts is nice but its 6 speakers isn't. It's not that they don't work because they work nicely. It would be nice if it had at least 8. As it is there are two on each front door (a large one at the bottom and a small one close to the window) and two by the rear window. It was be better if there was a large speaker at the bottom of each back door. The bose systen still sounds good though. 

Space: 
This is a pretty spacious car. The front seat is nice and the back's ok too. I wouldn't advise going on any long trips in the back seat of this car if you're over 6' tall. Trunk space is very good but for some strange reason that I have yet to figure out, the two rear speakers are visible in the trunk and are unprotected by anything. You can see the bottoms of them and I'm sure they could be damaged if you were to put anything large in too quickly. 

Now all those things are great and there are other great things too. But the best thing about this car is its value. This car (although not on paper) has almost as good a value as a BMW 3-Series or a Mercedes-Benz C-Class. There are many other cars of the same type that it has a better value than. It has many of the features of the BMW's and Benz's but at a much lower price. It has power leather seats, a good stereo, and it good in crashes, we had a minor one with a Ford Focus and the corner of the cars. The Maxima won without a doubt, the focus didn't compare. The focus hit the right side of the maxima (the focus' left) and the right head light came off the focus). The Maxima had a few cracked lights and a pretty big dent in the front, but there was no sign anything happened on the interior. The air bags didn't go off which was good, but I hope they didn't go of because the crash wasn't severe enough. This seems like a very safe car, like the BMW's and Benz's.
