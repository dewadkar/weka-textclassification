            We bought this camera so we could send pictures via e-mail.  It came with the camera itself, a battery, a CD-ROM with a copy of Photosuite SE, and the charger.  We've bought a Mavica before and was satisfied with it thus the choice for this unit as a second digital camera.  This unit is a barebones version of the older Mavicas.  It still used floppy disks for storage which is enough for about twenty pictures.  The biggest change they did was to remove the option to film movie clips.  This probably helped lower the cost and is justified.  Floppy disks can only take up to twenty seconds of film anyway so it's rather useless.  If you want to take film clips, you're better off getting the higher models which make use of Memory Sticks (up to 128 Megabytes versus the 1.44 Megabyte capacity of floppy disks).  Aside from that, only minor changes have been made to the software to make it easier to use for those who do not want a "fussy" digital camera.  

This camera is useful for typical users who do not demand too much from a digital camera.  The picture quality is average unless you really tweak the settings for the correct lighting situation.  I have no complaints though as I use this much like an ordinary camera taking pictures of everyday events where super-high clarity is not too much of an issue.  In terms of ease-of-use, this camera is pretty straightforward.  As long as you keep the camera on auto-focus, you can pretty much just point and click.  If you encounter a dark situation, just push the flash button.  That's all there is to it.  

For the price, I think this is fair enough a value.  The camera is durable and is not too big.  There is, however, no distinct reason to buy this particular model.  I would suggest looking around for other brands or models in the same price range and find out which works for you more.  Both my camera are Mavicas so I have no experience with other brands.  If you want a Sony though, I would suggest this model.
