            I'm about to turn my leased 2001 EX-L auto 4 cyl. in after 36 months and 44,000 miles of trouble free motoring satisfaction. Best car I ever owned/leased.  This model, with a leather interior , fine sounding 6 cd in-the-dash audio system and power driver's seat looks and feels like a luxury car, especially from the inside. 
This well designed car rides comfortably and is very roomy, both up front and in the back.  My wife and two full-size grown children were always comfortable on long road trips. Highway mileage of 30 mpg was consistently delivered, and around town and commuting mileage was 23 to 26 mpg from tank to tank.  The remarkably smooth revving 2.3 liter 4 cyl motor provides plenty of power, brisk acceleration, and is happy with regular gas. Smooth shifing 4 speed auto trans.

This car has required NO repairs over the three years' I leased it. Following the owners' manual, oil changes every 7500 miles, (5 times over 3 years) and one fresh $25 air-filter were the grand total of my maintenance expenses.  Oh yeah, I had to replace one of the windshield wipers for 12 bucks.  Visibility and driving position with the power seat are superb. If you are looking for a fantastic used car and you are secure enough in yourself that you don't need a fancy brand name, find a clean EX -L 4 cylinder and buy it.
After 44,000 miles my 2001 looks and runs like a champ, and the next owner will be driving a winner.  I'm so satisfied I just bought a new 2004 EX-L 4 cyl.
