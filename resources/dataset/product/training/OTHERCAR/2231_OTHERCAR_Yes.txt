            I have always been a Chevrolet/GMC fan and when my husband's GEO Prism got almost totaled by a Suburban, we decided to go with something a little more sturdy.  We looked at the Ford Explorer and the Dodge Durango but both cost more for what seemed to be the same basic truck.

There are several features I really like that helped make the choice for us.  The overhead console is very nice to put sunglasses and other small essentials in, rather than having to use the glove compartment.  Another nice thing is the compass and thermometer, and while it's not something essential it sure has come in handy many times.  The cargo net is real handy for holding up groceries.  I hate it when milk leaks all over the place because the bag fell over.  The cup holders are nice and I like the rubber insert that can be removed and washed if necessary.  There's also a lower console which we use to hold a first aid kit.  Incidentally, that was something sent to us directly from the manufacturer along with a small cooler.  It's these kind of things that can sway you one way or another.

The ride is really smooth and I like being able to see above all the cars.  The daytime running lights come in real handy and being higher is important to me because I hate driving in the dark.  This is a great family car and can easily support two car seats in the back seat.  We've taken it on several vacations where we had to supply our own food and everything fit in the back with room to spare.

I can't say much about the luggage rack because we've not used it to hold luggage.  However, we have used it to secure mattresses and box-springs as well as large sheets of plywood that would not fit inside.  That reminds me of something else.  The rear door was I think what made the sale for us.  Hatchback doors are fine on small cars but for an SUV it becomes a real hassle.  Imagine going to the grocery store, putting the bags in the back, things shift around, and when you open the hatchback everything falls out.  Having a two-part door where each part is independent of each other really makes my husband's woodworking hobby easier (something obviously important to a man).  It's much like having a camper on the back of a truck.  So what if the lumber sticks out the back a little, tie on a red flag and away you go.

There's only one thing I really don't like.  There is no gasoline &quot;idiot&quot; light.  All the cars I've ever owned have come with this feature and it was a real surprise the first time we ran out of gas.

Anyone who has kids, or is thinking of having kids should definitely look at this as their family car.  Just don't get the leather.<br><br>
