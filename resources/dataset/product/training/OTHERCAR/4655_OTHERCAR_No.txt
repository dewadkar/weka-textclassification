            I purchased a cavalier before coming to college in hopes that it would get me through four years without having to worry about it ... boy was I wrong ... 

First it must be said that I enjoy the feel and performance of the Cavalier and like to drive it ... having said that, however, my Cavalier has had more things wrong with it than is reasonable for a 4 year old car and I have had a rough time with it in the &quot;shop&quot;

Most problems have stemmed from inner electronics (dysfunctionality of dash wiring, engine check light, knock sensor, etc...) but my vehicles problems are not limited there .... without an outstanding GMAPP warranty that I purchased through my dealer, I would have sunk many thousands of dollars into this car ... this warranty expired at 60,000 miles and since then (6,000 miles; 8 mos.) I have spent over $2,000 repairing this car ... the one positive to my Cavalier's dysfunctional history is that I have not once been stranded (save user gas negligence) and have always been able to drive it into the &quot;shop&quot;

I would not recommend this car if you need hassle-free transportation ... and who doesn't?<br><br>
