            I purchased my Isuzu Trooper a couple of months ago.  It is a two-wheeled-drive LS model.

The biggest news for the year 2000 Trooper is its availability in the two-wheeled-drive powertrain.  Someone has finally figured out that in today's SUV market the average buyer is not going to be doing much off roading, they will probably not need 4WD.  Why, then, pay for exotic 4WD systems that cost more both to buy and to maintain?

The 2WD model is nimbler and smoother in highway and suburban traffic.  A standard equipment limited- slip differential still delivers significant traction advantages in all but the iciest conditions.  The 2WD Trooper has a smooth and moderately gutsy V6 with 215 horsepower and 230 ft.-lbs. of torque, which can tow up to 5,000 lbs.

The Trooper is spacious inside with 90 cubic-feet of cargo capacity.  With so much space inside it comes as no surprise that the exterior of the Trooper is also large and rides high above the rest of the vehicles on the road.

Overall I think the Isuzu Trooper has come a long way in terms of comfort and control from its early days as a military style convoy truck.  The 10 year 120,000 mile warranty is also a big plus. <br><br>
