            Please make room for the VW EuroVan VR6. We had looked for about a year at all the vans that are on the market, none can come up to the standard that the EuroVan VR6 has. Before I give you all the good stuff about it,let me tell you that we left Florida and had a stop over in Illinois and from there we headed west stayed in Yellowstone Park. From there we drove to Blanchard, Idaho and played golf for a week. Made a quick trip to Palm Springs for a family reunion. We left Palm Springs and drove to Pinetop, Arizona and spend a week there. Our grandson flew out to finish the trip with us. He wanted to see Pikes Peak and we certainly did that and back to Illinois to visit New Salem, President Lincoln's home for 9 years before he became famous. After Illinois we headed back to Florida. But since then we have been in North Carolina and back.

All right, now about why we had to find this VW EuroVan VR6. This van is not be confused with a minivan. The MV model seats 7 passengers comfortably, has two folding rear-facin middle seats, a folding table and a pull out bed. The seats remove easily if you need more space.  The bed is very comfortable and roomy. When we are on the road we drive with the bed down and whoever gets drowsy goes back and takes a few winks. We have snap on curtains that are a breeze to snap on.

Now here are the specs that might interest you guys out there. It has a 2.8 liter, 140 hp, 6 cylinder VR6 engine,19 cubic feet in the cargo area and an overall 200 cubic feet of interior space. Also has cruise control, heatable power remote exterior mirrors, central power locking system, child safety lock on sliding door, full-size spare tire, carpeted passenger and cargo area, 15 inch alloy wheels, front three-point safety belts, power front windows, dual illuminated vanity mirrors, windshield wipers with intermittent wipe feature, heated washer nozzles, dual folding armrests on front seats, pollen and dust filter, power-assisted rack &amp; pinion steering, halogen headlamps, daytime running lights, dual front impact airbags and ABS brakes. The warranty is great on the maintenance. VW dealers will cover regular maintenance for 2 years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first, protection Plus Limited Powertrain warranty for 5 years or 50,000 miles. And of course all EuroVans come with the 2 year, 24 hours a day Roadside Assistance package.

If you are looking for a van, I challenge you to compare any of the other vans on the market with this jewel. I love my van, my husband really likes to drive my van and loves to take those cat naps along the way.

We are heading for Indianapolis to see the Formula I race at the end of this month.  See you in Indy.
