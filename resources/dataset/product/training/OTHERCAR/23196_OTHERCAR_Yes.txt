            We purchased this car as a station car and to get around town.  We have also used it for longer trips of up to 1600 miles! With a Honda Accord you expect reliability and the 1996 Accord does not let you down.  We found the four-cylinder engine to have plenty of power and provide good gas efficiency.  We purchased the optional California emissions package and have had no problems passing our states emissions inspection.

We replaced the brakes once after the warranty had expired but Honda still did it for free!

We had two recall notices but both were handled speedily and with a minimum amount of disruption to our lives. 

For a four door sedan this car handles very nicely and has great pick up even when five passengers are on board. 

The biggest drawback is the poor visibility of the rear fender for parallel parking purposes. 

We were rear ended twice at low speeds and only minimum damages were incurred.

Would definitely purchase again.
