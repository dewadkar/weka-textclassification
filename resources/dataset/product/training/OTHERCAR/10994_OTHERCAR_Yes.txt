            Well since I know I will never get my dream car, I will stick with my Chevy Astro van. Mine is a 1993 model and we have had it for a couple of years now and have hardly had any problems with it. We have driven it all the way to Canada and back to Georgia and did not have the first problem. It also has over 100,000 miles on it and hasn't laid down on us one time (that I can think of) It has duel air on it which is great especially when you have kids sitting in the back. It is also the extended version too and is so roomy even with 4 captain chairs and a bench seat. I strongly recommend this kind of van for anyone with kids! When the fighting is going on, all you hear is the swish, swish instead of the slaps and thumps!<br><br>
