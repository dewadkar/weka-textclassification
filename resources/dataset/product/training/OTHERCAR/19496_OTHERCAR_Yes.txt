            Film would sit in my 35mm for ages before being developed. I dislike waiting to fill a roll of film, collecting rolls of film, taking film to developer, going to pick up photos which I then discover are bad or destroyed or who knows what. I top that off by putting the little gems into a photo box which gets dusted more than opened.

I thought maybe a digital camera would be the answer.

After the shock of the number of cameras available and sorting out the terminology and options, I figure out that two very important issues are: pixels and memory.  You'll want lots of both -- as much as you can afford.

I fretted and fussed over digicam reviews.  I decided that $1000 was my spending limit and that cleared things up a lot.  The Casio QV3000 Plus has a wonderful 340 MB microdrive that saves a LOT of photos (no other camera comes with it right now and it's a spendy add-on).  The 3.34 megapixels make great photos.  The ones I print on my HP printer I can share with pride.  If I want to frame the photo, I have it printed at a professional shop.  They look fantastic.  And the screen savers and wallpapers are such fun!

If you are computer literate, the Casio is pretty easy to use and the software is fine - simple, but nothing fancy.

I am generally careful with stuff, so I haven't and don't intend to really test the 'beat-up-ability'.  There are strong warnings on the box that you don't get this camera wet.  I've taken in on a few back packing trips and it was fine.

As with all digicams, the batteries are the kicker.  Just get a couple of sets of the best rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and keep a second charged set with you.  Then go have fun!<br><br>
