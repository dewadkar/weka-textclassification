            Version of car: 2003 Outback Limited Canadian edition, 18500km on the clock. The Limited version comes loaded with all you can think of, except for two features: an electronically controlled climate control system, and an autodimming mirror. Other than that the car has a 6 CD player, leather seats, two sunroofs,   other features expected.

Pros:

Great handling in bad weather - I actually look forward to those downpours and whiteouts to put my Subaru to its intended use. In Canada we get a winter package as standard equipment, which includes heated front seats, heated mirrors, front wiper defroster.

Missing: headlight wipers.

The car has great looking aluminium alloy wheels as standard, and the tires -Bridgestone Potenzas- are H-rated and excellent performers.

Cons:
An immobilizer/alarm system is optional: even a Civic has one there days. Most customers install one at an extra $400 before they take delivery of the car.

The biggest fault in the cars interior are the very easily scratched and chipped beige plastic components.

The engine is very sluggish for the weight of the car - even Subaru knows this. Recently a dealer told me when looking at an Impreza that the 2.5L engine really performs well in the Impreza as opposed to the Outback. The dilemma is whether it is worth the steep price of the 6 cylinder which starts pushing the Outback into a more upscale category of cars.

Conclusion: the car has really interesting technology. You are driving a car that is very different from the rest out there (even the windows are frameless), both technologically speaking, and also in design. I also like the fact that Subaru really gives you more for your money than other makes. I have seen doctors drive Subarus and you see the car in upscale residences - people who could afford much "better" but are somehow attracted to the uniqueness of the car.
