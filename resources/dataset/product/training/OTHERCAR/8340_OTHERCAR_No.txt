            I ran across a deal at computergeeks.com where I was able to purchase 2 Largan Lmini 350 digital cameras for $38 plus the cost of shipping. I had been needing *something* so that I could post pictures on the internet, and after reading many reviews, decided it was worth the $19.

<b>The Good News</b>
Everywhere I've seen this camera for sale, it's been extremely inexpensive. Good thing, because it's not worth much more than about $25. If you're like me and simply need a tool to get pictures on the web, it's very worth it. 

The camera is small and lightweight - very cute. It comes with a charger you can use when downloading pictures, thus saving your battery for future use. Good idea. So far I've had no problems with the battery. Since there's no LCD screen on the back with interactive menus & whatnot, it's good that the little window it does have is fairly easy to use and understand.

For such a cheap camera, the image quality is very good. It's slightly grainy, but certainly tolerable. If you have a very still hand, you can actually get some pretty good pictures with it.

<b>The Bad News</b>
This camera was <i>supposed</i> to come with a version of Photoshop. It did not. It came with a very, very rudimentary driver and photo handling software package. I couldn't use the camera for about 3 days while I tried to figure out what was going on. I finally went on the web and downloaded some freeware (I think it was ofotonow) that works slightly better. I repeat - SLIGHTLY. 

As I said before, it has no screen on the back where you can preview your pictures. That's half the beauty of digital cameras - the fact that you can see your picture instantly and decide whether it's worth keeping or not. With this camera, you snap your shot, and have to wait until you're back at the computer to see the results.

I've noticed several quirks after multiple uses. First of all, the viewfinder is skewed. If I go by what I see in the viewfinder, the left half of the subject is cut off. Considering that Largan is famous for the quality of their lenses, this surprised and irritated me. For the most part, I just try to compensate by aiming slightly to the right. Sometimes this works. Sometimes it doesn't.

For whatever reason (I'm not computer savvy enough to pinpoint the problem), I can't take more than 4 pictures at a time if I want to download any of them. If I take more than 4, the software I installed with it causes my computer to crash. On the rare occasion that it does manage to at least show me the thumbnails, most of them refuse to download once I've selected them. What a headache! If I needed this camera for any sort of frequent use, I'd be in deep trouble!

Another thing is that I have to shut down almost every application running on my computer if I want the driver to work. This is just another inconvenience that prolongs the time between shooting the pictures and actually being able to see them.

If you move even slightly during the shot, the image is completely blurry. I try to take most of my pictures by setting the camera on something stable to avoid this. Most of the shots I take freehand are unusable.

As you may have read in other reviews, the flash is completely useless. All it does is wash out your pictures. As a result, you can only take pictures in situations where there is adequate light as to not require a flash. Be sure and disengage the flash -every time- or your picture will be ruined. I tried in vain MANY times to overcome this problem, to no avail.

<b>In the End</i>
I would only recommend this camera if you can get it dirt cheap, like I did, if you REALLY need a camera for eletronic pictures (such as selling on eBay), or if you're just getting started in taking digital pictures (perhaps for a child). Beyond that, it's more headache than it's worth.
