            Kodak has produced a great camera for the cost in the DC240.  I originally started looking at this model because it supported USB connection downloads.  As it turns out, that's really just one of the many things that I like about this camera.  Since I've only ever used 2-3 others, I don't have a huge selection to compare to...but I've used a Sony that was about $250 more than this one, and it didn't have the features that this one does.  You can review all the various features at the Kodak web site, but suffice it to say that this camera delivers everything Kodak promises.

I've heard stories about digital cameras eating batteries, and I must say that this camera holds true to form.  Kodak supplied 2 sets of batteries with this camera: a regular disposable set, and a set of rechargeables.  The disposables were dead within a half-hour.  The rechargeables are still going strong after a few hours use and a few download to the PC.  The download itself (thru the USB connection) is fast.  Downloads about 20 pictures a minute in regular resolution.  The only things that I could really say bad about this camera are regarding the LCD and the display itself.  I find the LCD response to be a little slow.  As I move the camera, it takes the LCD a little bit of time to catch up...nothing serious...probably less than a half-second delay, but noticeable nonetheless.  The software provided is OK.  Nothing special, though.  

If you want to do any real editing, the Photodeluxe SW provided isn't really the tool I would choose.  I can't seem to do something simple like put a custom border around a photo, and annotate it afterwards.  I would recommend a separate SW purchase if you're looking to do any &quot;fun-type&quot; edits to your pictures.  

Overall, a GREAT camera at a good price.  Root around the net to get a good price on it.  The price range really is quite large.  I saw it from $415 upwards of $650.  I ended up with $440 delivered.  Good Luck!  Oh yeah...photo quality is excellent too!<br><br>
