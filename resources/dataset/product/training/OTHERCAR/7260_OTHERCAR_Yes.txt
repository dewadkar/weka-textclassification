            I rented a 2001 Grand Prix GT V-6 with 3800 engine to drive down to Virginia from NJ a few weeks ago. Having been with this car for seven days and more than 500 miles, I have my comments.

Engine and handling : Excellent. It is a fast car. Pick-up is good with 200 hp and it could get your ticket easily if you don't keep an eye on dashboard. Steering is nicely weighted and it easy to make turns.

Ride: controllable but not very refined as other good sedans. After 3 hours of highway ride, I found it acceptable but not outstanding.

Brake: It feels numb. For a few time when I had to apply brake hard, I didn't feel much on my foot thus I didn't get a good sense of security.

Interior: I love the exterior styling of GT, but for a car in this price range (over $20,000), it just looks too cheap with the &quot;plastic feeling&quot; inside the car. 
The fabrics used on doors and seats look ugly. And there are too many control knobs on the dashboard and stereo. For example I don't think GM shall place bass &amp; tremble control on a stereo because people don't reset them very often. When you have a busy and cluttered layout, it just makes it hard to find anything.
The illuminating light of dashboard is RED ! That is the only thing I can never get used to after 7 days. Visually it's not comfortable.
In short, Pontiac is trying to imitating a sports car but doesn't seem to have a good taste yet in term of interior design.

My conclusion with Pontiac Grand Prix GT is that, this car is what it looks. It got the appearance of a sporty car with radical styling, and it does have a powerful powertrain to prove. However, it needs more polish and refinement behind its muscle-car looks to justify its high price tag. Remember people can see Nissan Maxima or Toyota Camry Solara as better alternative.<br><br>
