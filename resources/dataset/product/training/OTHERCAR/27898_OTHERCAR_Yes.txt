            I bought my 1994 Olds Cutlass Supreme 2 door in 1997 with 55,000 miles on it.  It has been a fairly reliable car for me.  It gets terrific gas mileage.  When I first bought it, it used a lot of oil (a quart every 500 miles), but it turned out to be a bad sensor.  We got it fixed and I have not had any more problems with that.  Then there was the recall on the turn signal, which we took care of right away.

In the last year, I have blown a spark plug out twice.  I am not sure what causes this, but apparently it isn't stripping the plug, it's just working its way out. I have also had to have the brakes re-done at a cost of about $300.  The ABS drove me nuts for several months. I have to admit that this was annoying, but all cars need brakes now and then.

I have had some difficulty with glare on the dashboard from the sun and seeing around the big posts. Believe me, a person can hide in this area long enough to cause a serious mishap.  I have just learned to be more cautious and look more carefully.

In general, this little car has been wonderful.  I commute about 20 miles each way to work and it is very comfortable and easy to drive. It's got a lot of get up and go when you step into it. It is pretty low maintenance, and now has 111,000 miles on it.  I plan to keep it for several more years.<br><br>
