            Up until this past December my mother drove a 1992 Camry, which I will review in the future.  Almost 200,000 miles after buying that Camry she decided that it was time for a new car.  We looked at the Accord and the Maxima, but she wanted a Toyota.  After much research we (well I helped too!) decided on a 2001 Toyota 4Runner in black.  This SUV has been a dream, I just love it.  It does have its problems, the price/options ratio being one, but let me tell you about it and you can make your own decision!

<b>Different Models:</b>

4Runner�s come standard with 4WD although 2WD is available.  You can get the SR5 or Limited packages, but they are only available in models with the V6.  There are two different engines available for the 4Runner- a 2.7 4 Cylinder or a 3.4 V6.  You have your choice of a automatic four speed or a five speed manual.

<b>Technical and Engineering Aspects:</b>

The 4Runner�s frame, suspension, and engine are based on Toyota�s Tacoma truck.  The front suspension employs a double wishbone layout.  The rear-end suspension uses a solid rear axle which is suspended on coil springs.  All 4Runner models come standard with disc brakes on the front and drums on the rear.  If you order the base model you do not receive anti-lock brakes which come standard on all of the other models.

To shift into 4WD all of the models, except the Limited, employ a gear shift lever.  The Limited uses a push button to select 4WD high or low range.  Shifting into 4WD is effortless and the 4Runner is excellent off-road, although most people do not spend this much money on a vehicle they are going to go off-road in.

<b>Interior:</b>

I cannot stress how roomy I feel the interior is.  I am pretty short but my father is 6"2 and he has plenty of leg room.  The trunk is large and can be even further enlarged by folding down the rear seats.  The quality of the interior pieces is first rate.  They are durable and solid but are not as luxurious as you would expect on a high-end SUV.  I have to say that I love the leather seats in this vehicle.  They are so plush but they offer firm support in all of the important areas!

The 4Runner�s controls are well placed.  The instrument cluster is well organized, the radio and climate controls are within easy reach.  Road noise is kept to a minimum.

When you drive the 4Runner you are struck by how high you are seated.  This gives you an excellent view of the road, even for a short person like me!  Tall drivers need not fear, however, because my father is quite tall and he is quite happy with the headroom.

<b>Engine:</b>

The V6 engine, which makes 183 horses, starts easily on the first crank, even on cold sub-20 degree mornings.  It idles easily and quietly, although it does get a little loud under hard acceleration.  When you do accelerate rapidly you will find that you can hit 60 MPH in under 10 seconds, not bad for a SUV.  It tops out at 110 MPH, but I cannot imagine going that fast in this vehicle!  There is not a lot of low-end torque, 217 at 3600 RPMs.  This is not a problem because you will probably not be using this to haul a horse trailer.

<b>Driving:</b>

I am so surprised at how well our 4Runner handles.  I assumed that like most trucks and SUVs the high ground clearance would make it unstable in the curves.  Well its no Porsche but this Toyota corners surprisingly well.  When you hit road hazards you will be pleasantly surprised.  The shock absorbers do an excellent job in soaking up the bumps.  This does translate into a less than nimble feel when you are driving.  I prefer to feel the road when I�m driving.

I have not taken our 4Runner off-road.  I have a problem with putting an expensive SUV in a potentially destructive situation!  Especially if my name is not on the title!  I have several acquaintances that have taken their 4Runner�s off-road and they love it.  Its biggest assets are its short wheelbase and high ground clearance.  Those two features allow it to maneuver around most obstacles that would stop longer wheelbase trucks.

The brakes on the 4Runner are good during normal day to day driving.  They are smooth to apply and braking is easy.  I wish that the 4Runner had rear disc brakes.

<b>Features:</b>

Our 4Runner is the Limited V6 model.  It came standard with power door locks, power windows, heated exterior mirrors, air conditioning, light alloy wheels, CD player, automatic transmission, leather-clad seats, theft-deterrent system, and sunroof.

If you purchase the 2WD version the only standard option is a cassette player.

Bridgestone Duelers are the standard tires.  They offer  a balanced ride and good traction in both wet and dry conditions.

The headlights put out lots of light, more than enough for any conditions.  The windshield wipers and the rear defroster are excellent.

<b>Miscellaneous Information:</b>

The 4Runner gets average gas mileage for a SUV, about 16 MPG.  With its 18 gallon fuel tank you will be able to drive about 300 miles on one tank of gas.  Just don�t drive this vehicle into the Sahara desert, unless you have a camel caravan packing gasoline following you.

Despite the high price the 4Runner has the best depreciation numbers in its class.  Maybe this will help you rationalize buying this truck!

<b>Conclusion:</b>

The 4Runner is a very stylish looking vehicle.  It appeals to a man�s rugged and tough side while still being sophisticated and luxurious enough for a woman.  

The 4Runner�s quality is excellent.  This is the reason why a lot of people buy this SUV.  The typical Toyota craftsmanship is evidenced here in the fit and finish. 

The main problem with the 4Runner is the price.  It is really steep when it comes to price/options ratio but you must consider the excellent reliability and quality.

I have to say that this is one nice truck.  Everything about it exudes class.  You will be very happy with this vehicle!
