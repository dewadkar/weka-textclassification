            Now that I've finally began to move up in the world and have a little cash, I decided I'm going to get exactly what I've wanted. And this is it. (stop laughing! =) ) I wanted something old, but not too old, unique, reliable and comfortable. After looking into the VW vanagon, then at the Mitsubishi vans of the same era, I was upset to find that consumer reports and several sources on the web gave them both so-so reviews, but this model of van was all thumbs up, and most all the reviews I read reiterated it to be very reliable.I looked at 1 or 2 poorly kept ones before I saw my van and it was love at first sight.
   
 On the inside: It is very roomy, because like the old VW buses your kinda sitting on top of the engine in the front seats, neat interior, front/rear AC w/separate controls,comfortable captain seats. The seats. Can't say enough about the seats. The middle captain seats w/armrests can swivel all the way around. and the back seat is very cushy and has a reclineable arm rest in the middle with cup holders. I've also heard that some other varieties of the same model have a back seat that folds into a bed. So great for road trips.And the back seat comes out very easily, and the middle ones aren't too bad either. You can really haul a lot with the seats out. 

On the outside: I can't say enough how much I love how it looks, my friends call it the space cruiser. I've never seen another design like it.

Again its very reliable,I drove it down from New York City to my home town in Texas, and back without any major problems. 

The not so great things: As you can clearly see, the front of this van is pretty steep, so when your going 75 mph down the highway, there is some wind resistance. But I don't really notice it anymore. Also because of the engine being underneath the van, you have to lift up the front seat to get to the engine/oil stick etc. 

Some people are concerned with the "engine underneath" models, because there's not an engine in the front to guard you from a head on collision, but actually the design would be beneficial if your in a wreck where your car flips because just like the design of the VW Beetle/van its got evenly distributed sides, so the ceiling won't cave in. So that's kind of a give and take. 
It also can be hard to find information about it online or wherever. I had to do some digging, but its there.
