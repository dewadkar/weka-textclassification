            I won't go into the specifics for the camera, since the last reviewer already did. I will just tell you what I think about this camera.

I got this camera as a gift from my father, who living 4,000 miles away, wanted some instant pictures of his grandkids. I hate getting new technical stuff because I hate learning how to use it, but this camera was by far the easiest think I have learned to use. I read the instruction booklet, and tinkered with the camera pressing buttons here and there, and immediately got the hang of it.

Now... taking pictures is a... snap. No pun intended. You can take them like a traditional camera, putting your eye up to the view finder, or by turning on the digital picture window and centering your subject in the window. I prefer the latter, because you have to have your eye just at the perfect angle in the view finder, or else you can't see a darn thing. But using the picture window sucks up the batteries, unfortunately. Using the picture window to take pictures also allows you to zoom in and out... which you cannot do from the traditional eye viewfinder. You can choose the quality of the pictures you are taking, the lesser the quality... the more you can fit on one memory card. No matter what, I find the quality of the pictures to be just fine for my purposes. I could go on and on about how to use this camera, but I will stop myself now, and just tell you that it is easy to take pictures, very easy.

Downloading the pictures to your computer is also easy. My husband did all the software loading, so I have no comment on that process. All I do now, is stick the USB cord into the side of the camera, open the shutter, and the program opens automatically and leads me through the whole process.

I have to warn you though.... Depending on the quality of the picture setting you use, will determine the actual size of the picture. I haven't quite figured which setting makes the pictures large and which makes them small, because I change the quality setting all the time. But before I send any pictures or right after I download them to my computer, I use "Picture It" software, and re-size all of my pictures smaller so that when I send them, they aren't gigantic.

This is my humble opinion of this camera. Take into account that I have never owned or used another digital camera before, so I cannot make any comparison's. My opinion on this camera valid for my needs in a camera.... Ease of use, good quality pictures to send to relatives, but not professional quality. Research and study before making a purchase like this. Good luck!! I hope you find a camera that suits your needs.

UPDATE- I just read a review of the "Fuji Film FinePix 2600 Digital Camera" written by 'xyzwyatt'. It is a great review, and the camera sounds excellent. Be sure to check that one out too!
