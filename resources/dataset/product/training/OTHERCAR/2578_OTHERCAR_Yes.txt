            I bought my 1992 Honda Prelude Si automatic new, off the lot. It's been running excellently for 11+ years now, with no major problems. In fact, the only thing I've ever done besides filling the tank, changing the oil, and getting recommended tune-up's, is to have the muffler and intake manifold replaced. That's it. Period. The reliabilty has been truly phenominal.

THE GOOD:

The car's lines are still very modern and pleasing to the eye, and for some reason the car always looks glossy, even when it's dirty (a big thanks to the people who designed its curves!).

The body integrity has been above average. It does have a few creaks (mainly in the sunroof), but in terms of rust or loose parts, there have been none.

The car still has exceptional pickup and handling. 

Controls such as power roof, windows, mirrors, tachometer, etc all still function perfectly, with one exception: the radio antenna (and I believe this is a problem that is not unique to Honda). The power antenna still goes all the way up and all the way down, but after 11 years, it does tend to chatter/hesitate.

THE BAD:

Let's face it...the rear seats in this car are for show. This is a 2-seater with some "fake" seats in the back, enabling you to tell you insurance agent that it's a true four seater. Personally, I don't think this is a "bad" thing. I only mention it so that others will know that nobody but a dwarf or small child can fit in the back seat. If I need to transport my 4-month-old boy in his rear-facing child seat (in the back), the passenger seat must be moved all the way forward, with the seatback folded forward also. But hey, I bought this car 11 years ago, when I was a single guy, and this wasn't an issue at the time! For me, it's a small trade-off to be able to drive such a fun car!

The clock on the dashboard can be hard to see in bright daylight, and for some reason, it's the only control that isn't dimmable or brightable (if that's a real word?).

The trunk is still small. Is that a bad thing? Well, I knew it had a small trunk when I bought it, and it hasn't gotten any larger since then, but to most people, the trunk is way too small. I have not had any problems fitting all of my hiking/camping gear in the trunk, and it will definitely hold a few suitcases or large duffle bags, but it will not fit a folded-up wheel chair or folded-up car stroller, due to it's limited height (depth and width are okay).

THE UGLY:

Huh? There is none!! In my opinion, if you have the opportunity to purchase a used 1992 Honda Prelude Si, don't hesitate! I know of no car (new or used)that I would be willing to trade my 11-year-old Prelude for!
