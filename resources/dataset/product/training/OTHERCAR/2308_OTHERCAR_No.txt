            I bought a 1999 Kia Sephia because of the price.  I also got a 60,000 mile warrenty on it, which is a good thing considering how many things need to be replaced.

I had to have the car towed after only having it a few months.  After two weeks in the repair shop, I got my car back. I guess that part of the axle had to be repaired. They didn't give me the paper work for the repair until I filed a complaint against them.

One week after I got my dear Kia back, it started making the same noise again.  I had it towed and was then left on a payphone for two hours trying to get home.  Kia wouldn't give me a loaner car until they knew what was wrong with the car, never mind that I had just finished having it repaired. I finally rented a car with my own money.

Repair number 3 involved the fuel tank, it wouldn't fill up.

#4 was the fuel pump recall- &quot; could cause serious injured or death&quot;- and they made me drive it to their dealership which was two hours away.
If you have a little more money, buy something else!!!!!!<br><br>
