            The Mitsubishi 3000GT is a beautiful car all around but this just tops all other makes.  It is a 3.0L, 6 cylindar, it has a Turbo Gas engine, 320 horse power @6000 rpm, 315 toruqe @2500rpm. It has a beautiful body, my only problem with it is the tail is extremly high for a 3000GT. In other makes its tail was just perfect this trows the veiw off from its elegant body to its one mistake. To drive this vehicle is a dream come true. The engine roars like a lion, you fell like you are flying because you cant feel the bumps you would in other cars. This car is a car for everyone because it has the looks of a Porche, the speed of a Viper, and the beauty of a mustang. All around its a perfect car for an imperfect world.<br><br>
