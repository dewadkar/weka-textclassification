            <b>  A very simple camera to use</b>

   I have had this camera for about 1 year, I was taking pictures and printing them out within 30 minutes of taking the camera out of the box.  The software is very simple to use, you just hook your camera up with the cable and downloading into the computer begins.  

   After the images are downloaded, they can be cropped, brightened, red eye correction, color adjustment, make picture albums, or print.  They can even be printed while they are being downloaded, if no adjustments are needed.

<b>Taking pictures</b>
To use the camera, you can opt to either use the eyepiece or use the screen on the back of the camera to compose your shot.  First chose what zoom level you want, the 1 power is the default.  A word of caution on zooms, you lose some resolution, so if you want the highest resolution, you must have good light and only use 1 power zoom.  The one option this camera does not have is a time delay shutter, this would allow the photographer to get in the photo.

<b>Some Features</b>

Red eye flash - allows the flash to flash quickly, then flash again when the shutter button is pressed.

People Flash - Self explanitory

Fill Flash - This is handy when the light is behind the subject, or when a little more light is needed.

Macro - Very handy for taking pictures very close.
Time and date stamp - This is turned off by default, which is the way I prefer it.

Docking Station - I didn't opt for the additional $70 dollars for the docking station, it is just a fancy battery charger, I went to Wal-Mart and got a nickel hydride charger with 4 batteries for $9.99.  (By the way a rechargeable battery is the only way to go, it is much cheaper to operate with rechargeables.)

All in all this is a very nice camera for the money, most cameras with 3  meg of resolution will be hundreds of dollars more.

One additional item you will need is a memory card, without it the camera will only hold about 20 pictures in high resolution, with a 32 meg card, you can store about 70 in high resolution.
