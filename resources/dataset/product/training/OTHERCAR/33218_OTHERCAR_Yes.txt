            The Honda Accord is a remarkable vehicle, I have nothing but accolades for this excellent auto.  I leased my Accord in the fall of '97, the leasing option worked out rather nicely for me in that my payments were kept at a very reasonable price.  

My experience with the dealership was a mostly pleasant one, however I would recommend that any extended waranty or Road-side services be avoided, after all this is a Honda we're talking about.  Unfortunately I was not aware of this when I leased the car.  

The reason why I choose the Honda Accord was because of it's superior ride.  On that particular day I test drove the Mazda 626, the Hyundai Ascent, the Chevy Cavalier, and the Toyota Camry.  Out of all of these vehicles the Honda Accord stuck out in my mind, and for good reason, it was the best.  I was very surprised with its tight handling while still providing a smooth ride.  

Another pleasing feature was the 23 MPG/city and 30MPG/Highway.  Having owned the car for three years now, the numbers range from 20-27MPG/city to 27-38MPG/highway.  

The exterior has held up considerably well.  After bringing the car to college and suffering the abuse of college life it has remained in lack-luster condition.  I am now married and the abuse continues, and yet the car, after a good wash, looks like it just rolled off the assembly line.  

The interior as well, has with stood the test of grime.  I've spilled, smeared, smudged, and splattered all kinds of organic and non-organic substances on the fabric interior and yet it still cleans up rather nicely.  The scotch-guard has helped I'm sure.  

On the day I leased my Honda Accord, the only vehicle that would have come close was the Toyota Camry, however, the Camry just didn't have the appeal that the Accord had, with it's uncomfortable seats and it's ridged suspension, I'm glad I choose the Accord.  And besides my Mother-in-law owns a Camry, need I say more?  

Overall evaluation I give the '97 Honda Accord a solid 9!  Three years and 107,000 miles later I'm am please to say that I have done nothing to this vehicle, besides oil changes and a timing belt, and it still runs just like the first time I took it for a drive.        <br><br>
