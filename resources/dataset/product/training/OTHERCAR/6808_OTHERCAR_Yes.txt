            Update: 12/02: I was involved in another accident and again the car was there to save me. This was also a front-impact accident, and after repairs, the car is running great again. Definitely recommend for safety reasons.

Update: 7/01: My Legacy Saved My Life. In a rear-end accident just over a year ago, an old man in front of me stopped unexpectedly at an unprotected intersection. My eyes weren't on the road and I plowed into him, crunching my car and deflating my airbags. I was taken to the hospital and discharged a few hours later. I received my car back three weeks later after repairs. Had I not had airbags, I would have plowed through the windshield and had much more severe injuries. And unlike most cars, I haven't had any problems with my Legacy since the accident.

02/02: I've been taking my Legacy to the slopes! The only cars I see in the parking lots are Subaru's (beside the trucks & SUV's). The AWD system is a charm! I feel extremely safe driving in packed snow, slush, and other terrible weather conditions.

I leased my 2000 Legacy L a month ago. <b>I LOVE MY LEGACY.</b> I've already put 3500 miles on it, and it's still running smoothly.

The biggest factor in my car decision was safety, and this car is supposed to be the safest car this year in its class. It rated the best in crash tests, has air bags, traction control, and anti-lock brakes. The amazing part is: the Legacy can help PREVENT accidents from even happening with its unique All Wheel Drive system. Have your Subaru sales person explain it to you...it's worth it, for your life.

Inside the Legacy is like a dream. It's a fun ride and extremely comfortable. My 6'4" friend says it's one of the few back seats he's actually comfortable in. I go for long drives, and I'm comfy all the way there and it's a quiet ride compared to most of the cars I've been in (especially the Toyota Landcruiser). Comfort and quiet are two great pluses!

Even with soaring gas prices, I go 350 miles on a full tank and it costs me between $20-25 to fill-up. The sticker claims about 20/30 gas mileage, which is the minimum recommendation for a commuter.

I'd recommend this car to anyone in a heartbeat. 

<b>I LOVE MY LEGACY.</b>
