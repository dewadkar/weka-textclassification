            ...of the unique seating configuration.  The back seat, as you've probably read, is a bench.  But it splits in the middle so you can fold one side up and out of the way.  This greatly increases the storage space.  You can go a step further and remove one seat entirely while safely using the remaining seat.

I can't overemphasize how well this works, at least for my family of a 5 year old and twin three year olds.  We put one car seat in the middle bench with the five year old and one in the far back.  This allows us the ability to separate the kids so they aren't bothering each other.  Along with the sound deadening qualities of the sumptuous leather interior this keeps things much quieter than I have a right to expect.

We looked at the Expedition, Navigator, Durango and several others and were dismayed by the lack of storage space if you actually needed the third row of seats.  Huge vehicles and no space for groceries, strollers, playpens, etc.  The LX470's seating configuration is ideal.

What about other qualities?  Mom, who drives it every day, absolutely loves it.  It's beautiful, comfortable, and fits everything she needs to haul around.

I am most impressed with the power and acceleration of this unit.  I own an Infiniti I30 and a sports car so this kind of stuff is important to me and the LX470 delivers.  I have driven and owned underpowered SUVs.  The acid test was when I needed to tow my 5000 pound boat up a mile long, fairly steep highway hill.  It accelerated all the way up without being pushed hard.  I was a bit nervous pulling a boat that is on the upper end of the rated capacity, but again the LX470 delivered a feeling of confidence.

I've only needed the 4-wheel drive once so far, when pulling my boat out of a sandy ramp, and it worked fine.  I live in New Hampshire and have a steep driveway so the 4WD was vital for us, along with the substantial towing capacity of 6,500 pounds.

Negatives?
Sure - it passes anything but a gas station.
