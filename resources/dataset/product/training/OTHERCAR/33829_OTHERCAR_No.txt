            This camera is so small that it could easily fit in to a coat pocket. It is a great prise for the quality. I bought mine for 399$. The zoom lens on this camera is great. But my all time favorite part of this camera is that it is simple to use. Basically all that you have to know is how to turn the camera on, adjust the lens if needed push the shoot button and then how to turn it off. This is great for tourists. It is compact and there is no loseing or buying of film that will hassel you. For any one who wants to buy their first digital camera, I would deffinately reccommend this one to you.<br><br>
