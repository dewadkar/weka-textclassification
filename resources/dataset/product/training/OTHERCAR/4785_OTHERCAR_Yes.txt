            Alright, I may be biased because I own one, but I have to tell you that it is the best investment I ever made. I have been driving the Audi A6 for 3 years now and I have never had a problem with it. NEVER! I bought the A6, as opposed to the A4, because it had more passenger room and a roomier trunk. I also needed a strong car that could take me anywhere, and considering I have an addiction to snow sports, I definitely needed a 4 wheel drive system. I looked at tons of SUVs, but nothing compares to the handling of the A6 and its speed. I had owned a Pathfinder before and I was surprised to realize that my A6 Quattro handled ice and snow better than my previous SUV. The sound system will rock your world!!! I have never been so happy inside a car in my life.
I think that anyone considering to spend a large amount of money on a SUV should really think about looking at the A6 Quattro, unless they are seriously looking to go 4-wheeling. If you want the cargo room of the SUV, then I would spring for the A6 Avant Quattro....which is the wagon form of the car.......I wish I had!!! The ease of the wagon - being able to throw in your skies or groceries has me drooling - is definitely something I recommend. I will be trading my A6 in for the A6 Avant Quattro next year.
The only downfall of this car is the trunk......the design is flawed. When you open the trunk when there is snow or rain on it, it will slide into your trunk.
