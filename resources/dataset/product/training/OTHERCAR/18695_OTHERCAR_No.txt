            I purchased this camera because it was highly rated.  The images on their website looked impressive, so I spent the extra money and got it.

The images a very clear and crisp, however somewhat washed out.  Color saturation is lacking.  I have done extensive testing with all the setting to try and get some good pictures, but they still have too much white and blue in the photos for my liking.

The long battery life is a very strong bonus.  Using this camera at a camp for about roughly 12-hours a day, I only have to cycle between about 3 different sets of rechargable batteries.  However, so save power, turn off the LDC display whenever possible.

The menus are difficult to navigate without the manual and require too much setting.  A quick point-and-shoot camera is what I need.
