            The exterior of the Sable is very breathtaking.  It is very stylish with an European flair.  Many have complimented my car on how luxurious it is......and some have even asked if it is a Jaguar (because of it's rear end shape).  When this vehicle was redesigned in 2000, there was no mistake that Mercury decided to distinguish the Sable apart from it's sister, the Ford Taurus.  Finally, this car IS its own.

Inside, the car has a very comfortable interior, a gentle ride, a virtually noise-free cabin, and a simple instrument panel and gauges.  Options included in my car include Power Windows, Power Locks, Power Mirrors, Power Seats, ABS, Dual Air bags, AC, 24 valve V6, auto., cruise control, and intermittent wipers.  

Interior refinements are needed in the car though.  I hate the all-in-one climate control and CD/tape player.  I would opt for separate panels for these units.  Although the interior is comfortable, I feel that it needs to be updated.  When Mercury updated the exterior, they really should have done wonders with the interior as well.  However, they didn't.  The exterior is so classy, and I feel the interior could have been spruced up a bit. I'm not trying to say that the interior is horrible, it is nice, but I feel that it needs to be "beefed" up a little. Another problem I have is  whenever I get out of the car, I get a static shock.  And, it's not just me, it is also my passengers.  Otherwise, the car is very appealing, easy to drive, and very responsive.  

Besides the exterior's stylish design, I'm fascinated with is the car's transmission and 24 Valve V6 engine.  The engine is fantastic, and very quick.  You feel like you are driving a sports car at times.  And the transmission is great too.  For example, I set the cruise at 75 m.p.h. while taking a trip via the interstate.  As I was going up hills, I noticed that the car rarely shifted down at all.  You literally had to be going up a mountain to hear this car shift down.  I thought that was amazing. Due to the great shifting of this car, the gas mileage really racks up.  I get nearly 24-28 m.p.g.  

Finally, let's not forget Mercury Sable's 5 Star Crash Rating it received.  For those wanting to purchase a family car, that's one of the most important factors.  Mercury Sable is definitely one of the most safest cars on the road, not to mention one of the classiest.  You will enjoy driving one..........and purchasing one!
