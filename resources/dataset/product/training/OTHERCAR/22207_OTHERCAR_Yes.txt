            I have taken up the hobby of Photography but know nothing about taking pictures.  I bought the best camera I could find last June for under 300$.  I found this Gem.

It has become my companion on every outing.  I have taken lots of scenery, close ups of flowers, and tall buildings.  It has dealt with all of those well.  

As my skills have grown, and I desire to do more with the camera, I have found portions of this camera's features limiting.  It only has 2X optical and 3X digital Zoom.   This is good for every day pictures, but I have really wanted to zoom in more on many occasions.

Also, I have found that the extremely auto features (which are very useful most of the time) are sometimes limiting.  When focusing closely, depending on the light qualities, sometimes the colors get washed out, or one color is more prominent than others.  Nothing can be perfect and this would be a problem, unless I was trying to do difficult things with it.

Overall, I would highly recommend this camera as a starter camera, or for someone who doesn't want all the headache that comes with too many options.  It is very easy to use, and you get great pictures with very little effort.  True Point and Click.
