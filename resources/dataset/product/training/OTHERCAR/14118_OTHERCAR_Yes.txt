The Dodge Viper is by far the best car that Dodge has ever thought to make. Its original style and power is unmatched by any other production car in America today. It has a plain cockpit because all the emphasis is put on the performance of the car. Ive been a fan of the car since it first showed up as a concept car in the New York Auto show. I thought that the would change the model of the concept car like they do with all others, but to my amasement they left it. This is truly a car that power is unmatched for years to come.<br><br>
