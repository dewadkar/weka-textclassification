            I have wanted a Jetta since 1992 when I bought a cheaper VW (the mighty Fox GLS!) because at the time the Jetta was simply out of my price range. But I knew I would one day own one. When my faithful Fox finally petered out, the time had come to step up to the Jetta. I did extensive research online and found that the GLS was the model for me. It had all the cool features and options I wanted without the fluff of the overpriced GLX. My 2001 Jetta GLS has a huge VR6 engine, beige leather seats, cool wheels, heated seats, Monsoon sound system, sunroof, power locks and windows, plus lots of other neat stuff. Sure, the more expensive GLX has a few more options, but how often would I really use those "memory" power seat settings or need those rain sensing wipers (In Florida, it rains so much I just leave the wipers on all the time). Plus, I personally think the GLX's fancy rosewood dash trim looks like something my grandma would have had in her Buick. Yuck!

I had a decent experience with my local dealer and drove home happily. Once I reached the highway and found fifth gear on my manual shifter, I was merrily cruising along without a care in the world UNTIL I LOOKED AT THE SPEEDOMETER! Ohmigod, I was doing 90 MPH! I would have never known this had I not checked -- it was so smooth! Needless to say, my 1992 Fox could not do this. It tended to vibrate at speeds over 70, letting me know when to slow down. In my new Jetta, I had to quickly learn to temper my speeding...bye-bye leadfoot!

I've owned my car for a year and four months and no major complaints (nor any tickets -- yet!). I did break the handle on my glovebox but know this will be fixed at my next regular service appointment. The gas mileage is not great, but I have a 2 mile commute so who cares! If I'd wanted better mileage, I'd have bought the diesel.

The bottom line -- German cars truly are superior to American and Japanese. Test drive one if you don't believe me. They simply "feel" better, drive more smoothly and more solidly. They give the luxury feel of a more expensive BMW or Audi, but with a reasonable price tag. I just wish they weren't quite so popular -- when I first got my Jetta, I turned heads. Now they are everywhere! But trust me, the Jetta is worth every penny. Get the VR6. You won't regret it!
