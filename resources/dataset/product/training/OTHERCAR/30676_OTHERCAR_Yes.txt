            I bought my Grand Cherokee used.  It was 1 year old.  I really liked it.  I just traded it in a couple of weeks ago, and I was sorry to see it go.  It had a great engine.  It was an in-line 6 cylinder, but it had enough power and at the same time decent -- but not great -- gas mileage for an SUV.  It drove very nicely.  Mine had a few of the options:  CD, power front seats, automatic headlights, 4-wheel ABS.  I would highly recommend 4-wheel ABS for anyone getting an SUV.  Rear-only ABS doesn't come close.

I have traded this vehicle in only because I got a much better rate on a new car.

I would recommend this vehicle to singles looking for an SUV that's big enough but not huge, and as a vehicle that won't break the bank.  It is GREAT in the utility area, just as the original Jeeps were meant to be.<br><br>
