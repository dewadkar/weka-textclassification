            I bought a demo with 6,000 miles on it. I bought because I wanted an SUV with decent price, 4x4 and good gas mileage. I bought the car in Aug. of 99. It has been nothing of problems since. At first I took the car to the dealer for recall issues and repairs. There was an issue with the Hubs on the 4 wheel drive system. Apparently I didn't have 4x4 the first winter even though the little light came on. The dealer ended up replacing vacuum system and the hubs. There were a couple of other recalls that didn't affect my driving so I don't remember what they were. I do remember the trips to the shop. Next it was the airbags, the light came on and kept flashing. At first they had it in the shop two days and decided to replace the drivers knee air bag. Two days later I was back with the same problem. After having the car 2 day, and then telling me to bring it back in 3 days when they got the part. They replaced some sensor. 

The problems didn't stop. From small things like the door seals having to be replaced. To leaving me stranded by blowing continuously blowing the main fuse. I took it to the shop told them I had a puff of smoke come up from under the steering wheel. It took 3 days in the shop, and they discovered nothing. Then driving to work it just stopped. I managed to get it off the highway, and had it towed. Two days later they said a fan motor jammed and blew the main fuse.

The next winter my 4x4 was still not working. By now I was on the extended warranty so I took it to a different mechanic. They found out there had been a second recall on the 4x4 system they replace. This time they had to replace all the lines again.

Recently the car just decided not to start. I will stop for gas, and then it just won't start. Had it towed twice for this reason. The mechanic doesn't know what it could be. He said it was randomly starting and not starting at the shop. Even when it wouldn't start the computer told them nothing.

On the coldest day of the year the passenger window would not go up. The mechanic discover that if both the driver and passenger controls were pushed at the same time the window would go up. The back seat windows take at least 5 minutes to go down or up.
 
The air conditioner decided the front passenger need to have wet feet. And would drip 4 cups of water inside on a half hour trip. The mechanic fixed that one.

The air bag light is blinking again... haven't been back to the dealer to fix it. Apparently air bags are not covered under warranties even if you haven't set them off.

I am just hoping the car will run while I go car shopping.
