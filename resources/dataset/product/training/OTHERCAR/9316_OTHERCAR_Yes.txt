                The newly styled,fresh faced Toyata Supra is more than just a blast to drive, it's an experience all its own.  Upon first sight of this unobtrusive, yet elegantly fast looking car, I new I was in love.  That was just the outside.  The speed demon is well trimmed in leather and has very functional, easy to read,not to mention stylish gauges.  The sound system is also more than adequate. However it was not it's good-looks that really hooked me.  It is what's under the hood.  The engine is fast and has a, as odd as this seems, beautiful Japanese style roar.  Not the roar of a lion, but that of a powerful mountain lion.  Not to loud, but seemingly powerful enough to  kill an entire army.  The handling is beyond incredible.  Driving highway 50 in my home state of California this car was going 70 around curves on a 35mph highway without so much as a screech from the tires. Plus as we all know Toyota  makes cars that last.  I expect to be driving this awesome automobile for many years to come. The price tag may  be a little out of reach for some buyers, but you get more than your money's worth, especially in comparison to British cars such as the BMW M3.  The Toyota Supra is an experience all its own.<br><br>
