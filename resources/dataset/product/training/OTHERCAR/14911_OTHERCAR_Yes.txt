            I purchased this digital camera just to see what all the hoopla was about with Digital Cameras. Besides developing &amp; storing tons of rolls of film was getting too time consuming &amp; costly. 
Whenever I use this camera, people just gravitate over &amp; ask tons of questions. I have fun explaining how it works, showing them all the features &amp; even letting them take a picture or two. The camera is not heavy at all. All pictures are stored on 3.5&quot; floppy &amp; you get approximately 25-36 pictures per floppy. You also have your choice of digital effects before you take your pictures ranging from B&amp;W to Sephia &amp; everything in between. 
When I got this camera (purchased at a pawn shop) there weren't any instructions &amp; I mastered it in a few minutes. Anyone can do this!
The thing I most enjoy about this camera is its ease! I love previewing pictures before I save/print them up. Emailing pics with ease &amp; they come out so sharp &amp; clear. Battery time is awesome with a whopping 2.5 hours. The camera lets you know when its almost run down &amp; they charge up in a flash! 
The only drawback is the LCD display isn't protected. It would be nice if there was a protective cover for it when the camera isn't in use.

Anyone who is looking for a digital camera without a lot of confusing bells &amp; whistles should get this Sony Mavica. Especially first time Digital Camera buyers!<br><br>
