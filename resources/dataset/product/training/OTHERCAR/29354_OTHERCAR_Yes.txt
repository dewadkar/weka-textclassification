            I own a 1998 CR-V.  We decided to purchase this vehicle for several reasons.  My husband and I need a &quot;family car&quot; as we were trying to start a family, and we needed something that we could afford. We drove several different makes and models and did a lot of research.  We found that the Honda CR-V was going to give us everything we wanted for the least amount of money.  

This vehicle rides like a car, not like a truck like many others we test drove.  It is cheaper on insurance too because they classify it as a station wagon.  This particular model seems to lack a lot of &quot;get up and go&quot; but that is something that wasn't really important to us. The CR-V gets better gas mileage than a lot of other SUV's too.  This vehicle comes with it's very own built in cooler and picnic table which has come in handy a couple of times.  Also in the back there is an extra 12volt plug in that is nice when camping.

The CR-V has a lot of leg room in front and back and the cargo space is roomy as well.  We travel a lot with our new baby and we can pack everything we need into the CR-V like the stroller, portable crib, luggage, etc.  We have never had to leave anything at home because it wouldn't fit in the car.  One thing I don't like is that there are no arm rests in the manual transmision model.  If you aren't use to arm rests then you won't notice it, but if you do have them you will miss them.  There is a web site though that sells the arms rests if you want to install them yourself.

I really enjoy driving this vehicle and I am very happy with our purchase.  Not only does it ride nice, but it is comfortable and it has a nice appearance.  This vehicle is well suited for small families.  I highly recommend this vehicle.  In fact 2 people have bought a CR-V because they liked ours.  A friend that I worked with and my step-mother.  They both really enjoy there CR-V's and thank me all the time for introducing them to this car.
