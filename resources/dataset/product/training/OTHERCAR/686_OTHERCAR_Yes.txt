              Featuring a 1/2&quot; high density CCD, my new Nikon coolpix 950 is in the top rungs of its price range.  The incredible image quality is attributed to the 2.11 million pixels it's able to record per picture.  This camera has been more than useful in putting pictures up for ebay, taking pictures of the family and of the family vacation.

  The coolpix 950 has excellent quality in short (macro) and long range pictures.  The lense is a Nikkon multicoated, with 9 elements in 7 groups.  This translates to superior clarity and glare reduction.  Unlike a lot of other digital camera's, it is equipped with a 4-step digital zoom, 1.25x, 1.6x, 2x, and 2.5x.  If you select the macro option, you can take clear pictures as little as .8&quot; from your subject.

  The shutter speed is adjustable from 1/750th of a second to 8 seconds which means with a good tripod (to reduce camera shake) you can take very low light pictures.  It has a 2&quot; high quality LCD monitor to use as a view finder, which is easily visible in even bright light.

  These features put only a dent in what this camera is capable of.  An incredible camera, it is well worth the cash.<br><br>
