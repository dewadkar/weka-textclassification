            I got this camera cheap at an online auction, basically I wanted it to put things on the web or in some programs (I'm a programmer). 

I have no problem with the picture quality, it's fine for me, but only if there's excellent lightning conditions because there's NO FLASH!!  Unless of course you spend even more of your hard earned cash on a huge bulky ugly clip on piece of junk just for some light.  

Another problem, battery power!  This camera wastes enormous amounts of juice especially when you are positioning the camera for a good shot, because it constantly displays everything on the LCD screen (like a little movie).  Buy some fresh expensive batteries and within the hour you'll be seeing that annoying low battery power sign flashing.

The one thing I did like was that it holds many pictures and keeps them even when the camera is shut off, (something I wasn't sure off at first), 
and I like the LCD it's really nice but kills the batteries.

If you can get this camera cheap with a flash and perhaps even a AC adapter to save you battery juice when you're downloading the pictures into your PC (takes about ten minutes), it's worth while getting but there's probably some better digital camera's out there.
