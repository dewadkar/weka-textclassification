            The Xterra is a really good looking SUV.  It's bumps and silver bars make it that much cooler.  The Xterra is built on the Frontier's frame, which gives it an edge on all it's competitors.  The Rav4 or the Rodeo are built on a car type, four door sedan frame.  So if you're looking for an SUV to go off roading, this is the one.  The silver roof rack and the step up rail make the car that much pimped up, if you'll excuse the term.  
You can get it with a V-4 or V-6, 4x4 or 4x2.  I recommend the 4x4 for those that are actually going to utilize the SUV for what it's made for.  For those who just want to look cool in the city in their sweet SUV, I recommend the 4x2.  Why? mainly because in the city 4x4 isn't really needed and also the 4x4 is a little noisy.  I think the 4 cylinder(143 hp) is lacking enough guns for terrain or the city.  I recommend the V-6 (170 hp) because it just gives your car a feeling of power.  Plus you want the guns with the sweet car.
The interior isn't the greatest, but that isn't why one would buy this car.  I'm not saying it's bad, just not luxurious.
You can get the XE or SE, which has all the packages.  Check out www.xterra1.com to see all the details.<br><br>
