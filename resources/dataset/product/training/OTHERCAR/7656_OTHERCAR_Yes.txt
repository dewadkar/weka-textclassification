            I own three (mitsubishi) Monteros....to me the finest of all the sport utilities vehicles...i have a 85, 93SR and 97SR...and hope to get a new 2000-1 soon...all three of them distiguish themselve primarily in how reliable they are...i starting buying them because of strong built, quality workmanship and this things just dont die...my little one (i call my 1985 2dr, 4cyl. stick shift...the little one is now 15 years old and undergoing her first full body and paint job (and the one she has is not bad)...very dependable...will go anyplace.  I feel that the Montero is a vehicle for ALL AGES...IT PROVIDES GREAT SAFETY FOR THE MOM TAKING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL...IS A WORK HORSE IF NEED BE FOR THE WORKING MAN AND FOR THE EXECUTIVE IT IS A FIRST RATED VEHICLE ....SPECIALLY THE SR MODEL...THE VEHICLE IS EASY TO DRIVE AND WILL TAKE YOU ANYPLACE...BUY ONE AND NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT ONE......MIKE ROMEU....SAN JUAN. PUERTO RICO<br><br>
