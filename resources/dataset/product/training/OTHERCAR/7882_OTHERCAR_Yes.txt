            I always wanted to own a Luxury car.  For a long time I was always the passenger in one, but the time finally came for me to be an owner.
I am in my 30's and my wife and I always considered Caddy's to be a grandparent car.  That's until we set our eyes on a 1994 Eldorado Sports Touring Coupe, 2 door chrome mags and totally classy.  We were sold.
Then came the test drive.  
Everything in this car is electric, including the seat adjustment which offers any position you can imagine.  The dash is computerized, you can set the trip meter,average mpg, average mph, miles left you can go on what gas you have, how much gas you've used,engine coolant temp. and how much oil life is left till you next to change it.  I am sure I probably left out one or two things the dash can display.  But, you get the picture.  If a Cadillac doesn't have something it must not be out yet.
O.K. so we have just started the engine by now, the dash read out has now informed us that all monitored systems are o.k. then we turn on the Bose cd player and relax in the soft leather seats.  We don't need to leave the parking lot we are sold!
The back seat passengers' comfort was taken into consideration in this car.  It is most suitable for 2 passengers in the rear as the seats are in a bucket/bench styling, soft leather and low.  Also, they have the rear seat vent to adjust the comfort level of the heat or air conditioning.
The ride is smooth and the Northstar does not disappoint, I have had it to considerable speeds and it rides as well as it does going the speed limit.  
The downside to this car is the fact that it is a Cadillac and a Northstar to boot.  Then add in the fact it is a touring sports coupe, it all adds up to $$$$. 
At 52,000 miles the air conditioner pump went out, price $1000.00.  Now at 54,000 miles my digital dash is now telling me to &quot;service ride control&quot;  I have not had it priced yet but I was told to expect it to be a lot of money, that it is probably a little motor that services the shocks.
Several months after the purchase I was doing around 35mph and the streets were wet, this was the first rain I was driving in with the El Dorado since buying it.  (I live in South Texas, rain is few and far between.) Well, it slid and hit a curb, pop goes a tire.  
Sir, the tire man says, you have the sports touring coupe, you should put Z rated tires on that car.....$425.00 for 2 new tires.
Now the gas prices are through the roof and my car only uses premium gas, and I get around 17 mpg around town.
I don't know if I have just a faulty car or what.  I know people who just have to do the basics and have more miles then I do on their caddy and haven't had the a.c. problems or the ride control.
I need to say I have always had the suggested service done at the Cadillac dealership, and my wife drives it around our small town to the grocery store and what not, she doesn't work, so the car isn't put to it's limits by any means.  
So, I do love the car, but these little things are getting to me and my wallet.  I belive its going to be traded in after this repair.  It is a beauty and driving a Caddy does get you noticed, especially by the dealership for service. <br><br>
