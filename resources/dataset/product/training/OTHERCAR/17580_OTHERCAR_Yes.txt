            I leased my 98 Tacoma Extended Cab V6 4x4 SR5 TRD because I had previously owned a Toyota 4x4 and was very pleased with it. I worked at a Toyota dealership at the time, and was quite impressed with the reliability of the Tacoma.  I have been extremely pleased with the vehicle so far.  (So have all of my friends who have driven it!) 32,000 miles and counting.

First and foremost, this is one tough truck.  I chose the off-road package for two reasons: better off-road capability, better ON-road handling.  This truck handles well!  The upgraded suspension, Bilstein shocks, and Goodyear tires make a great combination.  There is not much body roll in corners, and little understeer.  However, the tradeoff for good performance is a harsher ride.  You will feel the bumps.  I would not recommend buying the TRD package if you want a smooth ride.  In addition, 4x4 is not really necessary unless you live in snow, or plan to do serious off-roading, all it does is worsen the gas mileage (I get about 20-21 mpg, which is good for a heavy V6).  I say this because I often travel off the road in 2WD, and only in the toughest situations do you need 4WD.

What I like most about this truck is that it is very fun to drive.  It has a lot of power, and it holds the road well. I love it.

One note: The turning radius sucks. (40 feet)  This is because the CV (Constant Velocity) joints in the front drive system wear out if turned hard while in motion.
