            My husband allows me to pick out the family vehicle, although if we had no children I still would have picked this Sleek,Green, Grand Caravan from Dodge. This 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan is our 3rd Dodge Grand Caravan and as the children grow-up we cart the teams, and now the grandchildren. They entire family borrows this wonderful ride. The seats roll out so easy I can even do it myself. 
The interior, plush gray, is so easy to maintain and clean. Comfort is all I hear when taking passengers on long excursions. Most of them have Cadillac's and can't believe how much MORE comfortable my ride is than theirs. I just smile and say I know.. 
There isn't much to hate except I do want the newest model out with the electric sliding side doors. I almost fall asleep while driving, the tight doors and windows seal out the noise outside and the stereo, (stock I might add) is so clear and relaxing. We have 63,000 miles on ours and have the extended warranty so we are covered bumper to bumper for EVERYTHING... until 75,000 miles at which time we will own the newer model. We haven't been in for any major repairs (No down time, if you know what I mean) and if we did have down time our additional coverage rents us a vehicle until we get ours back! That is a great feature Dodge has and they do,do it!
With the seats out its a cargo van with them in it holds 7 adults, there isn't anyone that couldn't use this vehicle. We get stopped all the time by older people 50+ which like the exterior style and want to know how is it on the open road ? Generally we take them for a test ride and they are sold right away!<br><br>
