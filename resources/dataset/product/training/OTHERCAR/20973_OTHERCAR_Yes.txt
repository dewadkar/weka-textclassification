            The GMC Suburban is probably one of the most versatile vehicles on the road today.  The newest models are vastly improved over the previous ones, though.  My family owns one of the older ones, and it is a tank.  The truck (that is what it really is, a truck with a few extra seats) can haul anything, and gets you to where you want to go in safety and comfort.  The problem with the vehicle is that it does ride like a truck sometimes, and rolls and floats over the road, giving a somewhat disconnected feeling, but that does provide to soak up even the biggest Michigan potholes.  We had a Starcraft conversion model, which sucks.  What they put in the car was some wood, new seats, and a TV/VCR system with a cd changer and headphone outputs.  Everything they put on the car broke, including the added outer body trim.  The passenger side front seat also was afflicted with a draft which made for some cold/hot drives in the wintertime.  The dealer could not fix the problem, saying it was common on those truck, including the pick-ups and Yukon/Tahoes.  Overall, it is a great vehicle, which, from the little driving that I have done in the newest model has been drastically improved upon in every department, especially drivetrain and suspension. <br><br>
