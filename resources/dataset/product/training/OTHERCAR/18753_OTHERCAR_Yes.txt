            Fell in love with this car 6 months ago.  Acquired an order in Feb.  Took delivery 5 days ago.  Absolutely no regrets.

While BMW and Lexus reputations are well earned, this car succeeds in exceeding those two marques' performance, appearance and value.  RWD guarantees that Acura is left in the dust.  280hp, 270 ft=lbs, 18" rims, loaded with a vast pack of options that the others soak you for - ya can't go wrong.  The car is not broken in yet, but I did dust a 5.0L mustang w/o exceeding 4K rpm. :)

Seats are super sporty - well bolstered.  Even the rear seats are buckets.  The leather covering is stunning - makes the Merc Benz leather seem very cheap by comparison.

Engine is silky smooth and quiet for cruising.  The exhaust gets very aggressive and throaty over 4000 rpm.  The Auto tranny shifts effortlessly, but the manu-mode is a little slow to respond (like many others).

Stereo sounds great, but audiophiles will want to replace the drivers and amps.

18" rims + LSDiff. package is only ~$600!  Very expensive replacement tires - but hey, you get Porsche-like handling in return (0.92Gs in some mag reviews!!!)

This car gets a lot attention as it oozes down the street - quite an unexpected kick.
