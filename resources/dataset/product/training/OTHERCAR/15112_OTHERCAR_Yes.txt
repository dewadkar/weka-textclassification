            I purchased this car new in 1999 and currently have 68,000 miles on it. It is the SE model and is fully loaded. Vehicle lives in the Canadian Prairies, so knows adverse weather conditions and really bad road conditions.

Construction: This vehicle is well built. I have not had a rattle or squeak since purchased nor have any parts came loose. Doors close solid and tight, hood and trunk are well fitted. 

Mechanical: Simple formula: Gas it, oil it, and drive it.
Never quit on me yet. The braking system is 4 wheel disc and is very smooth. It is not unusual for them to squeal, and require frequent cleaning. The factory Firestone tires absolutely sucked, and had to be replaced at 26k, at my cost. Ya have to lube the power antenna often or it will stick partially extended. 

Performance and Handling: Adequate for size of motor. You wont get whiplash on full acceleration. Very tight steering gives you good "road feel". Buying the SE suspension was a mistake as this vehicle does not have the weight to handle a performance suspension without a rough ride, especially with the state of most of our roads. I am also disappointed with the gas mileage as it is more below the published values than expected. (EPA 39 highway, I get 32 best case)

Appointing: High quality leather and interior finishing. Body parts fit well, and are solid. Minor problem is the plastic thingy that hangs down under the front of the vehicle was engineered one inch lower than the standard parking curbstone height. Power seat controls are hard to find and use. Back seat room not good when I am driving with front seat back all the way.
