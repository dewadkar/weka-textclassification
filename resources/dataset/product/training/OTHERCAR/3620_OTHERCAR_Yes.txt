            Ok, most people sit and dream &quot;oh yeah, I'm gonna get a jag, and I'm gonna get a lexus&quot; when what they need to get is real!  C'mon, most people can't afford those cars!  I try to be logical and practical.  I currently own a 1995 Chevrolet Lumina Commonwealth Edition (a special trim package with a luxury cloth top and chrome detailing) but the Grand Prix GTP is my dream car!  After driving one, I've gotta own it! So everyone read my reviews so I can make enough money to put a down payment on this puppy!  :P

One day I'll be able to own this baby.  In black or red, with a supercharged 3.8 V6 engine and 240 horses, VROOOOM! (heh heh, like I need anymore speeding tickets)  This car has the look, it's got the speed, but it's also practical.  The mileage is decent, and you can get the sedan with 4-doors.  It's roomy, comfortable, can hold stuff in it's trunk and you can still look damn cool pulling up in this baby.  Pimp it out with tinted windows, a system and some rims and you will be the daddy of the mack da-dee for somewhere in the mid 20 thousand range.  If I really had the cash, I'd pimp out and get a bonneville SSEi AND a V8 Firebird as well! Pontiac cars are just beautiful to look at!<br><br>
