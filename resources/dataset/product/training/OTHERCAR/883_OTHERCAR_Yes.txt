            This is a very fine digital camera. The quality of the pictures is outstanding. I have been a professional photographer for several years, and have used Nikon 35mm, Hasselblad, Canon 35mm professionally. I have owned a Nikon 700, Nikon 950, and Canon Pro 70 digital cameras. I have printed up to 8x10 on my home printer. The 3000 is very user friendly, and takes wonderful pictures. I rarely have to adjust in Photoshop any of the pictures, the focus and exposure are very accurate. The 3.3 megapixel in my opinion is all one needs to produce more than enough resolution. I would highly recommend.<br><br>
