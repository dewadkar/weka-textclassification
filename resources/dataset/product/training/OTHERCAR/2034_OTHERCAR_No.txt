                 Thinking about purchasing a Kia Sephia?  As a former Kia salesperson, I have some valuable information to share with you.

     Sure, it's a cheap car, it gets great gas mileage, and the warranty can't be beaten.  And it comes with emergency roadside assistance.  Sounds like the car for you?  Please read on.

     We all remember the <i> Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i> car, so named because of the noise it made while driving.  I liken the sound of driving my Sephia to that classic old show.  When I start my car, the engine ticks.  When I turn a corner, something makes a loud thacking noise under my car.  Chitty, chitty, bang, bang.

     I purchased my Sephia in February of 2001, less than a year ago.  At 7,000 miles, my key would not come out of the ignition.  The key was stuck like that for a month.  Since then, I have had the brakes replaced (I had <b>total brake failure</b> around 10,000 miles), and I am bringing it back to the shop to have the brakes fixed <i>again</i>.  The catalytic converter was replaced around 14,000 miles.  Now, at 15,000 miles, the suspension is shot.

     For all you financial people out there, <b>Kia depreciates worse than any other car</b>.  Simply put, you are buying a <i>disposable</i> car.  You will have a hard time trading the car in when the time comes (and if you own a Sephia, the time couldn't come quick enough).  Also, it is one of the more expensive cars in its class to insure, because the cost of repair is high.

     The last year for the production of the Kia Sephia was 2001, but the Kia Spectra is the same car with a different name.  Same mechanics, different body style.  Buyer, beware.  You are buying a Sephia in disguise.  (some inside information....they're changing the name of the Sephia because of the bad reputation it has.  Go figure.)

     In conclusion, I would not buy a Kia again.  I prefer to spend a little more, and know that my car is reliable.  I would hate to think what might have happened if my children had been in the car the day those brakes failed.  I hope I have aided in your automotive decision.
