            ...was a 1990 blazer that my dad bought for my brother and me when i was 20. (in 1998) at 175,000 miles we realized it was a risk, but the $1000 price tag sold us. it has been a thoroughly enjoyable vehicle. the 4.3 liter engine is the most responsive six cylinder i've ever driven (a step up from the 36 hp one in my bug) and the seating is more comfortable for four (five if you're small) than any small suv i've seen, with plenty of storage to spare. braking, steering, suspension: nothing phenomenal but get the job done. upon purchasing we had the transmission gone through and worked on (about $400); i've heard that this is the achilles heel of these trucks, but i've driven it over 30,000 miles now and have had no discernable problems. i really think that if you watch the people who have chronic auto problems drive, you get an idea why. as my friend dave moody (proud owner of an '88 jimmy) says, &quot;just be gentle&quot;. anyway, engine died at 204,754. when we cracked the block open, it looked like the oil had NEVER been changed. stalagmites in the engine. it only made me more proud of my blazer.  just completed a trip to the florida keys (from GA), and it ran admirably. i'll post again when i hit 300,000. :)
