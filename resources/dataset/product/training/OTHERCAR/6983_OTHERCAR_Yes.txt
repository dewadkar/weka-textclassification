            We purchased our Blazer before they were redesigned in 1995.  Ours is easy to handle and performs very well in the rain and snow.  The four-wheel drive works flawlessly and comes in handy during the worst of weather conditions.  The ride is not overly bumpy, but on long trips, it can become uncomfortable.  There is plenty of space for a family of 4 with a dog.  We've experienced only minor mechanical problems in the 5 years we've had our Blazer.  The only problem we've had deals with the rear defroster.  A design flaw causes the wiring to separate from the grid.<br><br>
