            My parents recently bought my sister the new Saturn LS, and lucky me, I got to drive it for a week while she flew home. I currently own a Saturn SL1 '97 (and before that an SL'95) so it was fun to try out the new (highly advertised) Saturn LS. 

My initial thoughts after looking at it were &quot;this is really bigger?&quot; From just seeing the outside of the car, it looked like my &quot;smaller&quot; Saturn only with a few tweaks and curve-changes. Although once I got inside I did notice the front is bigger, the backseat is much more roomy, and the trunk seems to have some extra space that's lacking in my older Saturn.

After driving it around for a week, all I can say is that I'm jealous that she got the new car. My parents wanted her to have a bigger (mid-size car, which this technically is classified as) with more safety features (which the new Saturn LS has) incase she ever got into an accident. I know she did a lot of test driving with other mid-size cars from other dealers/manufacturers but she eventually decided on the Saturn LS in the end because of the price, features &amp; safety. 

Overall, the Saturn LS drove very very smoothly and has good gas mileage on city streets (lots of stops &amp; go where I live). Plus, even though the Saturn LS is technically a bigger mid-size car, once you drive it a few times it felt exactly like my smaller car (although it did have that nice &quot;new car&quot; smell).

My only complaints were that the steering didn't seem as responsive as my older Saturn (but that could just be my own picky-ness), and when I had the windshield wipers going at full blast one rainy day you could actually feel them rocking the entire car (at first I thought I was swaying to the music playing, but quickly realized it was indeed the powerful wipers moving the car). 

For the price, options &amp; safety you get with the new mid-size Saturn LS, I definitely recommend it. And so far my sister has had no complaints about it (true she's only been driving it for 2 weeks though). But the dealership has gone out of their way to help her with any questions she's had. (Plus who can pass up free donuts when you visit them). 

Saturn itself has always had a great reputation for dependability and service. I know they have a 30 day money back guarantee (which not many, if any, dealers offer) plus give a warranty for up to 3 years/36,000 miles -- which comes in very handy incase there's any problems in the future.

The Saturn LS is a great new addition to the Saturn family and perfect for anybody who is looking for a mid-size car with extra room, features, safety and dependability. I highly recommend the new Saturn LS.<br><br>
