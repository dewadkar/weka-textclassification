            Dodge Ram...Yea baby!!!..
This is my 3rd Dodge Ram 1500 extra cab short bed. Let me tell ya..
she's better than ever. !
Power - 360 5.9L Mag
Year - 2000
Model - 1500 Extended Cab 4 door Quad Cab short bed
Color - Silver
I was amazed at the smooth quiet ride of my new truck, My previous
2 Dodges had the extended cab but lacked the 4 door option
that was introduced in 1999. Even quieter than my last truck!!
Sharp Styling, Towing is a breeze, 12mph local, 17mph on the highway.
I completely recommend this truck to every one!!!!!!!!!!!
