            I bought �Margie� new back in 1989.  I had just spent one year of hell with a Nissan Sentra I had also purchased new, but by the time the year had passed, my vocabulary of swear words had more than tripled and I decided I had to dump it for something better or start taking Valium to cope.  That�s when I found my pretty black MX-6 LX.

It didn�t happen by chance that I visited a Mazda dealership when car shopping.  My mother had owned one of the earlier 626 models, and another worker at my company had purchased an MX-6 about 6 months earlier and I kept admiring it and even stated to a friend one day how much I liked it�s looks.  The salesperson and the manager at the dealership both told me I was losing a lot of money trading in a car that was only one year old but I would have none of their advice, drove the car home, and left the Sentra behind.  I have never regretted my decision.

All the complaints I had about the Sentra were solved with the MX-6.  Although I would consider it a compact, the MX-6 is spacious enough inside for four people, however the legroom in the back is cramped for most adults and tall teenagers.  I don�t believe anyone over 5�7� has ever been in the car but I suspect those nearing the 6� mark will find headroom a problem.  Seating is very comfortable and the driver�s seat has an arm at the left side to adjust seat height and there is a lumbar support, which can be adjusted in addition to the standard forward/backward and backrest adjustments.  

Instrumentation is well located for easy reach and includes stereo tape deck including four speakers and balance and fader adjustments, heater/air conditioning controls, power window buttons, rear window defogger, and a fun little addition of oscillating cooling vents. As a matter of fact, I went to lunch with a couple of friends one-day and these vents were moving from side to side to disperse the air.  One of the women took one look and said, �That�s it, I want a new car.�  That, in itself, isn�t so telling as the fact that she had just bought a new Acura about three weeks prior.  The only elements that are lacking in the instrumentation are oil and temp gauges, which I prefer over �idiot lights.� 

My particular car is a five speed manual transmission and also came with power door locks, split rear, fold-down seats that when down access the truck compartment allowing enough space for all kinds of luggage and even for a person to lie down and curl up for a nap on long trips.  My model has a sun roof that can either be popped up at one end or slid back by motor to become hidden, for the full open effect.  The car is also appointed with a tilt steering wheel, adjustable intermittent wipers and cruise control. 

The engine is a 2.2 liter with enough pep to spin the tires and I have never felt I at a loss for power with this car.  I live up a rather steep hill and usually make the grade in 3rd or 4th gear.  Shifting on the car is firm but not tight, with no excess play, even after 12 years.  I do not have to fight it to slip it into gear as I did with a Nissan 200SX turbo I had previously owned.  The power steering is also smooth and firm without being too stiff.  The car handles extremely well overall.  I�ve had it on every type of road with the exception of snow.  Gas mileage is about average.  

The styling inside and out is also very pleasing.  The exterior design I would describe as timeless. Mine has a factory spoiler on the back.  It was a smart looking car when I bought it, it stands up to any late model car for style today, and will probably blend in well with car designs in the next 10 years or so as it is neither too angular or too rounded (some cars today look a pit �puffy�).  If cared for properly, these cars will look like a new car when clean and detailed.  A co-worker who had not seen mine asked it if was new when she saw it for the first time after I had already owned it 11 years!  I also had a man at a gas station one very rainy evening about 2 years ago remark, � That�s too pretty a car to out on a night like this.�  Since the outside is black, Mazda chose a gray interior.  The seats are an attractive two-tone velour fabric that shows no wear whatsoever.  I do put covers on the front seats of all my cars, but the matching fabric on the armrests where one would expect wear is in perfect condition as are the back seats.  When my daughter was younger she did manage to put a very small hole in the fabric on the underside of the sunroof when it was relatively new.  I was concerned this would fray open over time but has not.  I do have to qualify the car�s condition; it has always been garaged or covered when at home and regularly washed and waxed at least twice a year which will help preserve any car.

The only problems I�ve had with my MX-6 have been minor.  During the second year I had it the sunroof began to stick a bit on the flip up feature and a part of the frame of the driver�s seat broke.  Both were covered under warranty so they were no cost repairs.  Other than normal maintenance I have only had to change the valve cover gasket.  I have had lingering problems with the driver�s door and window but this is a result of the door being hit when the car was only one year old and having to be replaced by an independent body shop.  It just has not been the same since, but that is the fault of the repair, not the car.

I only have about 76,000 miles on my MX-6 but I had two other friends who owned them and one made it to about 200,000, the other�s was at about 150,000 when she moved away.  I did make one upgrade to the car and that was to put a little heftier tire on it when I replaced them.  I felt the tires that came with the car were just a bit too small and even looked at bit small in the wheel well.

The high Kelly Blue Book value for the 1989 model Mazda MX-6, in excellent shape, is about $4,500.  If someone can find this car in <i>excellent condition</i>, as mine is, for the $4,500 or less, it is an outstanding value.  If I had it to do again, I would buy the same car again, with no hesitation.
