            I had to write this opinion because I just returned from a long 6 hour trip to see my relatives and was so impressed with my car's performance. With gas prices skyrocketing the way they are (at the time of my trip I paid $1.93 per gallon), I was so impressed about the gas mileage I was getting--I averaged 30 mpg (highway) and only had to fill up twice (once on the way there and once on the way back!). Before this trip I had already loved my car. It's the Z24 model in bright cherry red (my favorite color and the primary reason I bought it in the first place), with tinted windows, CD player, AC, automatic transmission, and power locks/windows. One of the best things about it is that it has ZERO rust!! That really impresses me since I live in Michigan where when it snows we get dumped on. As a result, our road commission uses tons of salt on the road each year. I have kept it waxed really well since I've owned it (about 3 years now), but it seems as though the original owner did the same. The engine purs just like new, with a few exceptions of erratic idling, but I found out from my mechanic that all Cavaliers do that once they reach a certain age. My particular car has 111,500 miles on and is still going strong. I hope to get many more miles/years out of it. I'd hate to give it up!

So, if you're looking for a reliable, sporty looking car, and don't want to pay the outrageous prices for the premium fuel you must use in regular sports cars, this car is for you. I am nothing but satisfied with it.

P.S. The acceleration is like no other!!
