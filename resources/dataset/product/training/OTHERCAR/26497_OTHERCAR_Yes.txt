            In 1994, I bought this truck with the Two Tone paint, Black and Teal. It has a vortec v6 with extended cab and I will tell you all that it has been everywhere and never left me stranded. I have had it in the hill country fishing, and driven it for long periods on the highways. I have put all 75,000 miles on it and it still feels like it did the day I bought it. I love the power, can still lay a second gear scratch, I love the fact that the Air Conditioner still cools the interior down 100 yards after I have been in it even on the hottest days in Texas. The stereo system is really good, and the gas mileage is acceptable, but goes down quickly if you lay your foot in it. The only real gripe I have with my truck is the seats. On long drives, like to Witchita Falls to see the Dallas Cowboys Training camp, the seat becomes increasingly unsupportive and if you have suffered sports injurys like me it will tend to make your have to stop and stretch out after 6-7 hours driving. It tends to make my butt numb, but there is plenty of shoulder room unlike other pick ups so you can stretch out a little and find a comfortable driving position.Atleast for the upper half of you body. The little jumper seats in back is another completely different story, Unless you have children under the age of eleven, you are a sadist if you make people ride in those side sitting plastic jumper seats. I would not recommend it even for children beyond maybe an hour or so. For me it has just enough room to put my golf clubs in and that is all I needed.<br><br>
