            I have a 1999 Cavalier Z24 and I absolutely love it.  I love the sporty look that it has and the way that it drives.  The salesman knew what he was doing when he pulled the Z24 around knowing we really wanted a basic model Cavalier.  So off I went to give the Z24 a try.  I came back to my husband and said I love it and he said try the basic model and see what you think because that's what we really came there for.  When I returned the decision was made.  I wanted the Z24.  The 2.4 liter quad four really surprised me on how much more power it had than the 2.0 liter engine.  I know that I wont be winning any races or anything but I loved the difference.  I also loved the look of the Z24.  It was alot more sportier with all of the ground effects and spoiler on the back.  I then had to decide what color I wanted and I picked white because I think that GM has a really pretty bright white and it all ways makes a car look richer and its something that I will not get tired of.  I have now had my Cavalier for 8 months and it has been a great car.  When getting an oil change I just take it to the chevy dealer and use the coupon book they gave me when I purchased the car so they end up being very cheap.  The only bad thing about this car is its not a family car.  I have a 15 month old son that needs help in and out of his car seat and getting in the back seat is kind of tough.  The good advantage is the passenger side seat moves all the way up so that gives me a little more room but if you have more than one child its really not suitable car.  I will keep this car until I have another child.  The only thing I would change about this car is to be able to release the trunk from the inside.  The only way to get into the trunk is with the key or with the remote, but the remote must be out of the ignition when releasing the trunk and that is a pain when you are dropping someone off and they need there packages out of the truck you have to turn the car off and then restart it right back up.  Overall I really am happy with my car and am glad at the choice I made.
