            (NOTE: the vehicle pictured is a 2000 Maxima <b>SE</b>, <i>not</i> a GXE as stated in the caption.)

When it was time to get rid of our 10-year old Mustang GT, we wanted a 4-door car that was as fun to drive, but more reliable. Although the Mustang lasted over 100,000 miles, it had broken down several times and was clearly on its last legs. Also, driving a RWD in snow and ice is not very fun. 

We researched and drove the Camry, Passat, and Accord, in addition to the Maxima.  We ultimately settled on the Maxima because it represented great value for the money. Many of the &quot;options&quot; on the Camry and Accord came standard on the Maxima: FWD, ABS, dual airbags, CD player (on SE and GLE), power locks/windows, remote entry and alarm, alloy wheels (on SE and GLE).  Also, the 6 cylinder, 222 hp engine provides more than enough muscle for short highway ramps.  In order to get comparable &quot;pickup&quot; in the other cars we tried, we would have had to pay several thousand to get the 6-cylinder engine (or turbo on the Passat).  Best of all, the GXE and SE come in a 5-speed. 

There is loads of room in the passenger compartment and in the trunk.  New this year is a 60/40 fold down rear seat (pre-2000 models only had a small opening in the armrest.) This car seats 5 adults comfortably.  The &quot;neosuede&quot; cloth in the SE is much more comfortable than the cloth in the GXE, and the seats in both offer firm support.  (We did not drive the GLE because it came with automatic transmission only.)

The interior design is well thought out, with large cupholders and compartments for CDs and tapes. The stereo has many features but is easy to use, the heat and AC are powerful.

In general, the Maxima is a good looking car.  Some folks do not like the taillights; admittedly they are different and take a little getting used to. The GXE and GLE models come with red taillights, the SE with the &quot;smoke&quot; rimmed taillights pictured above. In general, the SE taillights work better with darker colors, like the black and grey lustre (a dark charcoal gray).  For its size and muscle, this car gets very good gas mileage, too: 21/28, we average about 26. 

It is possible to get a new GXE for under $20,000 and a new SE for under $22,000.  In short, it's a good value for the money; it's often compared to luxury and sport sedans which cost 5,000 to 10,000 more!  This car handles like a sport sedan but has the room and economy of a &quot;family&quot; sedan. It's lots of fun to drive and I would recommend this car to anyone who is considering a 4-door sedan but still wants to have fun on the road.

(Note: some cars have a squeak where the front right pillar joins the dash; this appears to be an individual problem as ours never had it.  Listen when you test drive.)<br><br>
