            When I see a <b>Toyota 4Runner</b> on the street, I can't help but think of a particular Far Side cartoon: two explorers are brought before an entire tribe of natives. One particular native is standing on two others' backs, with a huge head dress and other decorations. One explorer turns to the other and whispers: &quot;I think this one is the chief.&quot; Indeed, Toyota has established itself as &quot;the chief&quot; in many ways, being one of the world's most reputable car manufacturers. And this is why, when my aunt was making her SUV purchase decision back in November, Toyota's &quot;chief of SUVs&quot; sprung into my mind first. The dealers were very courteous to lend us a program 4Runner Limited for a full day of test-driving. Here are my impressions:

<b>EXTERIOR:  9</b>
Once built on the Tacoma platform, the 4Runner received its own chassis in 1996, and has since seen very few exterior upgrades, save a minor facelift for 1999. Why? Because it looks great! Some reviewers on this site have described the 4Runner's body as beautiful, others claim it looks tough. I agree with all such statements: the 4Runner is stately, but gives up no ground on ruggedness. With 11 inches of ground clearance, the 4Runner stands tall and confidently (very much like a chief would?). The only problem that people might find is that the design is still based on a truck ladder frame, which means less of a carlike ride. Getting into the 4Runner is not as easy as getting into a car, but it's considerably easier than other SUVs due to its low floor. And, as far as looks go, I feel the 4Runner is <b>one of the best looking SUVs out there</b>.

<b>INTERIOR:  7</b>
Stepping inside our test Limited model, my first impressions were positive. Walnut wood and leather surrounds you; it seems very inviting. A few closer looks made me come to my senses. For starters, the not-so-spacious interior belies the massive exterior. And the dash, for instance, was not too well-designed. The radio controls are placed rather low, and the display is hard to read with glare or even at night. The climate controls are blocked when you use the cup holders (which seemed a little flimsy to me. Be careful not to spill stuff onto the controls below!) The seats are rather low on the 4Runner, and I had a hard time getting comfortable in the front seat. The fact that I am 6'3&quot; may have had something to do with this. Still, I had the same complaint sitting in the back, combined with a little less leg room than I would have liked. The reason for the lack of rear legroom is the huge rear storage compartment. This is a major plus because you will be less likely to have to fold the seats down. We tested this theory by doing a grocery run. Two grocery carts were filled (potting soil and dog food took up quite a bit of space), but they were easily dumped into the back. Another feature I liked was the power rear window. An ingenious feature, all you have to do is turn the key and the rear glass slides down for easy loading. No heavy doors need to be swung up or out. The air conditioner works quickly and efficiently. The stereo is good, but does not top the Pathfinder's Bose system. All in all, I feel the <b>interior has nice touches, but needs even more</b>.

<b>ENGINE: 8</b>
The current V6 gives out 183hp and 217lb.-ft. of torque, which are adequate numbers for <b>adequate engine performance</b>. We could feel the power draining a bit when we loaded the truck with people, however. Still, the shifts are smooth and the power curve is evenly proportioned throughout acceleration. My main gripe with the engine is the sub-par fuel economy. Even for an SUV, the 4Runner (especially 4WD models, I hear) seemed particularly thirsty. The rather small gasoline tank is to blame for frequent fill-ups. I would not recommend the 2.7L 150 hp 4-cylinder that is also offered. Manual transmissions are available for either engine selection, although automatics are far more popular.
The 4Runner uses an on-demand 4-wheel drive system and can be shifted from 2-wheel drive into 4-wheel drive while the vehicle is in motion. Maximum towing capacity is 5000 lbs.

<b>RIDE:  7</b>
The 4Runner rides confidently and solidly on any terrain. You can instantly feel you are driving a high quality vehicle. Be warned that this &quot;high quality vehicle&quot; in particular <b>still rides like a truck</b>, which doesn't translate into the most compliant ride. And because you will be on the road more often than not, I think this is an issue that needs addressing in a $30,000+ vehicle. Irregularities in the road are not muffled as well as in other SUVs that cost far less. Significant tire hum and wind noise can be heard as well. The engine runs very quietly thanks to excellent sound insulation.

<b>HANDLING:  7</b>
The 4Runner's tires stay planted during moderate turns. A little tire squeal is audible, but not much. The body leans considerably during emergency maneuvers, which is <b>typical for SUVs</b>. I never felt alarmed at any time, however. The turning radius is rather large, and the steering feels disconnected, which doesn't help in parallel parking. Still, the wheel needs very little adjusting at highway speeds, which made me happy.

<b>RELIABILITY:  10</b>
To run my little analogy into the ground, the 4Runner is certainly <b>the &quot;chief&quot; in reliability and value retention</b> for SUVs. An enviable record has been established through droves of happy customers and solidly-selling used 4Runners.

<b>VALUE:  6</b>
Although the Toyota 4Runner will connect on its promise of dependability, I still have a hard time justifying the <b>hefty price tag</b>. This truck has one of the largest price ranges I have seen on any vehicle, starting in the mid-20's and moving well into the mid-30's. Problem is, the bottom-priced 4Runners have a weak 4-cylinder engine and come in very bare (no ABS or A/C, for starters). At the higher end, prices climb into Lexus RX300/Mercedes M-class territory... food for thought.

<b>THE VERDICT: TOYOTA- LET THE BUCK STOP HERE, PLEASE!</b>
I was impressed by the Toyota 4Runner, but its price was enough to steer my aunt away from sitting at the dealing table. Personally, I don't blame her: there are many manufacturers that are making strides in improving quality, power, and car-like attributes in their SUVs. If you have the money and are certain the 4Runner is for you, then you'll be happy with your decision... I'm certain of that. But if you use coupons at the supermarket and curse at your monthly phone bill then maybe there are better options out there for you (buying a <i>used</i> 4Runner certainly isn't a bad idea). In closing, the 4Runner would be near the top of my favorite picks for this class if the price came down. In the meantime, I probably won't be humming &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; (couldn't resist!) when I see one cross my path.
