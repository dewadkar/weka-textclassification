            I bought this car in '99 and love everything about it.  The sporty 2dr grand prix is everything I've ever wanted in a car.  With the 16" chrome wheels and a spoiler, it looks fierce.  The appeal of this car is not just it's outer looks though.  Once you open the door and sink into one of the plush bucket seats, you won't want to get out.  The seats adjust perfectly to every driving style.  After you get the seat set, and crank it up you see an amazing display.  Mine came with the laser speedometer option that shoots your speed into your front windshield.  It's hard to explain in writing. You'll have to check it out for yourself.  Even in the 2dr model, the people riding in the back have enough room to be comfortable.  The 6 speaker Bose sound system is unbelievably clear for distortion at high volumes, and the sunroof option ads a sporty touch.
