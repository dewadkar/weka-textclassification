                I purchased my '97 Wrangler new. I was looking for an inexpensive 4x4 for my wife to drive due to the frequent snowfall here in Western Maryland. I also thought it would be fun to have a convertible to use in the Summer.  I found the perfect combo in the Jeep Wrangler. This vehicle is tons of fun. For the ultimate &quot;wind in your hair&quot; experience, buy this car. Remove the doors by removing the 2 nuts on the hinges on each door(2 minute job), lift up the door restraining strap on the inside jam, then lift the doors off and put them away for the Summer! 
    Putting down the top takes about 5 or 6 minutes after you get the hang of it. Unzip side windows, unzip the back window, pull out the plastic tabs over the doors, then unhook the hasps inside above the windshield, and push the top back. It folds nicely behind the rear roll bars and seat. 
    I must admit that this car is noisy. But actually it is quieter with the top down. The Wrangler also has a slightly harsh ride. The ride is much improved over the pre 97 Wranglers and CJ's, though, with the coil spring suspension. The 4 cyl engine does ok around town but is lacking on the highway, so if you intend to do much long distance or mountain driving I recommend the 6 cyl. Fuel economy with the 4 banger is around 19 mpg. 
    Off road this machine is unstoppable. Put it in 4 low range, 1st gear and it will crawl over or through any obstacles. With adequate ground clearance you don't have to worry about bottoming out either. The 4wd inspires confidence when driving in the snow, too.
    Overall this car has been reliable. We have 38000 miles on it now. It has been to the shop for replacement of the air bag sensor module(recall), and for a catalytic convertor(2 times,warranty). We also have a cracked exhaust manifold waiting for replacement now. I have not heard any one else with this problem(if you have, let me know).
    This vehicle is recommended for any one looking for a fun, go anywhere car. Not recommended for any one looking for luxury, roominess, or quiet ride.<br><br>
