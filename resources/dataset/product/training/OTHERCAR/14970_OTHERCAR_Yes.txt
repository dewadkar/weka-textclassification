            Other reviewers have noted the shortcomings of the Sony Mavica line of digital cameras. These drawbacks are for the most part factual, but they are also avoidable if one takes the time to structure the scene in a way that will suit the needs of the camera.   The FD-73 indeed does not perform well in low-light situations, and the colour comes out somewhat splotchy and dotty. It is usually a simple thing to bring light into the scene, and if one is willing to spend the hundreds of dollars on a digital camera, then they are probably serious enough to afford to add a torch to their equipment box.   Photo quality can also be a little dodgy in some scenes due to the JPEG method of compression. This usually means jagged edges and &quot;colour fog&quot; because the JPEG averages colour temperature of various sized fields and goes with that average instead of slight variations. For best results you'll want to shoot scenes that have gradual colour variation over large fields. Skin tone works best, and close-up face shots with good lighting come out fantastic every time. But don't shoot in the dark, in the fog, or very far away.   Perfected digital cameras exist and are on the market for $15000 each. If you want to spend only $400 on a digital camera, especially one that uses floppy discs and saves them as JPEGs, you are going to have to make some sacrifices.   I use my Mavica to do photojournalism for a university newspaper, and neither myself nor my editor have any complaints. I would recommend it to other semi-pro photographers, especially because of the floppy-disc based storage system which makes submitting photos to your photo editor a dream: No hours wasted in development, no danger of anyone opening the door to the darkroom, no chemicals, no bothering with prints. Best of all, you can email or put your photos on the web, saving a trip into the office.   It is a very useful thing. Of course digital cameras will get better and cheaper with time, but that is true for any technology from the toaster to the space shuttle. I have no reasonable complaints, and *everyone* that plays around with mine wants one of their own.<br><br>
