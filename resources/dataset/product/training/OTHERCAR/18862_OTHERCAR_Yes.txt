            I originally purchased this vehicle in 1998 because I was moving to Ohio from Washington state with my wife, dog, and 3 hamsters, and I wanted a vehicle that was spacious, affordable, dependable, and good in the snow.  The RAV4 has pretty much lived up to or exceeded my expectations, with three exceptions.

I am amazed at how much stuff we have been able to cram into the RAV; the interior is more spacious than my parent's Jeep Grand Cherokee.  We have moved twice in the two and a half years since the purchase, Washington to Ohio and then a year later to Alaska.  We were able to fairly comfortably transport a lot of cargo on these trips.

I am very pleased with the looks and features of the RAV.  We have the equivalent of the &quot;L&quot; version, with custom alloys, privacy glass, power windows/locks, etc.  The factory sound system (with CD) is surprisingly good, and the interior is comfortable.  Also, the ride is very carlike and comfortable. 

What I dislike about the RAV is that the power is very low on steep grades, the factory tires have worn much too quickly and are prone to puncture, and the AWD system is not as good as shiftable 4WD.  When traveling across the country twice, we noticed that on steep mountain grades, the power dropped significantly, usually dropping our max speed below 50 mph.  We now have 32000 miles, and the tires need replacing.  Also, every tire has had a flat at some point due to nails or screws in the tread (this has never happened to me before, and I don't drive through many construction areas or have any enemies that I know of...)  Finally, this last year my wife has been driving the RAV and I purchased a Kia Sportage which has shiftable 4WD.  I have noticed that the 4WD when engaged on the Kia has superior traction and stability compared to the RAV4 on demand AWD, which on the icy roads of Anchorage my wife had a problem with fishtailing and spinning around turns, even at safe speeds.  This last problem also may be partially due to worn tires, and for this year we purchased studs; hopefully this will solve the problem.

Although the largest part of this opinion deals with dislikes, overall we are very pleased with the 98 RAV4.  There have been no mechanical problems to speak of, and I expect continued reliability for a long time.  It is probably the only car I've ever had that straight off the showroom floor, I was so pleased with the looks that I didn't want to customize the car at all, and I still feel that way.  We have a 3 year lease that expires soon, and short of some amazing incentive to purchase or lease another one, we plan to purchase this vehicle.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a reliable, affordable, good looking and spacious SUV, but would discourage any one who expects to do some serious off-roading.
