            We purchased the car used from an individual when it had about 38,000 miles on it.  We bought it with the expectation of it giving us many years of reliable service, due to Volvo's reputation. We also liked it's appearance and liked getting a "luxury" car.  We loved it's comfort and driving experience, however, about 1 month after we bought it, I had to start taking it to the dealership under warranty time after time.  Things wrong: Coolant level low light came on, said to stop safely ASAP, had to add water.  Door striker latch had to be replaced on left rear door.  Due to clunking noise in front, had "dust guard shock absorber front side replace with spring seat, wheel alignment, 4 wheels calibration, steering wheel adjustment.  CD player was skipping - I was told to clean my CD's and use a CD cleaner (the CD player was defective, but I had to keep bringing this up and basically argue for them to replace it finally).  Noisy left turn: topped off power steering fluid and pump line tightened.  Left rear door lock had to be replaced. Speaker cover on front dash was loose and had to be replaced. Right rear passenger door clunk noise when opening, part replaced. Replace engine cooling fan due to a recall.  Radiator cracked and had to be replaced. (dealership insisted our other Volvo mechanic was probably wrong about this - then had to eat their words..and replace it under warranty). A/C not cooling: parts and O-ring were replaced. Need 4 new tires at 43,989 miles. Sluggish start: downloaded software update to upgrade this. Right front door lock replaced after the part finally came in from being back ordered.  A/C not cooling properly - refrigerant draining: refrigerant replaced. (no charge at dealer).  Roaring noises when turn left: fluid reservoir power steering replaced plus a clamp replaced.  The roaring noise on left turn came back 4 mos. later (now out of warranty) but covered since less than 12 mos. lapsed: they topped off the power steering fluid with synthetic oil this time (4th time for this repair on this car!)Warning light "Emission System Service required": repaired vacuum line at intake manifold.  New front brake pads at 52,500. Replaced valve stem in Michelin tire.  Turn signal assembly (side lights) fall out, hanging on wires, have to pop them back in.  ABS Brake system faulty, needs to be replaced for $708 at Volvo mechanic's place ($900 at dealership). Car surging when first start and at stop lights: repaired vacuum line at intake manifold (again).  It loses it's smooth shifting (automatic) and idles with more noise around 50,000 miles.
This car is SCARY.  That is why we traded it yesterday at a Honda dealership for a new Accord EX V6....it only had about 56,000 miles.  So much for many years of reliable service..Good bye Volvo.
