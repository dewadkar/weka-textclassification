            Almost two years ago, I received the Polaroid PDC 640 as a birthday gift from my husband and children. What a great gift! I have received great enjoyment from it all this time. Definitely not one of those gifts that was bought at the last minute that you tire of easily. Ok ladies, you know what I mean! (lol)

I will admit, when I opened this gift, I thought 'ok, HE bought himself something and is just saying it's mine'. I was slightly intimidated by a new fangled gadget that I had no clue as to it's operation. But, I soon determined THIS camera is mine and mine alone; and if he's lucky, I might let him use it!

My PDC 640 came in a kit with everything needed to begin an adventure of great photo opportunities. Included in the kit was the camera, carrying case, patch cord(for computer and/or tv hook up), ac adapter, computer software and an EASY to follow owner's manual. 

Of course, the first step is to read the manual; which takes you step by step in the use, operation and care of your camera and accessories. Once you read the *how to's*, you're set! No confusion, no worries. It's very simple. I would not be stepping out on a limb, when I say that this camera is so easy to use that my two year old son could take great pictures with it!

All you have to do is point and click! With the LCD screen built right in, you can automatically look at the pictures you have taken. See a picture you don't like? Don't worry, just delete and snap again! No more worrying about those pictures that turned out with everyone's eyes closed you had *meant* to send grandma; if their eyes were closed, fine, take it again! 

 I have found, with experimenting, the best pictures are taken on the lowest resolution setting. So, for the best quality pictures, I recommend using that setting. Once you have taken the pictures you want, whether it be one or several, just attach the patch cord to your camera and computer and begin the downloading! The software that comes with this camera is as easy to use as the manual. Within minutes, you can view your pictures on your monitor, full sized! The editing program is rather limited, so I save the pictures, do a small amount of editing and then finish (if need be) with another picture editing program.

Under most conditions, the pictures can turn out with printable quality. You can do this yourself, if you have a really good printer. Or, you can save the pictures to CD and take it to a photo processor that develops pictures from a CD. If you're not really looking to print the pictures, but just to share via internet, this is the way to go. Take a picture, download and within minutes it can't be sent to whomever or wherever you need it to! Within minutes! No waiting DAYS for that film to be processed.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my camera and recommend it to everyone. Especially to parents. How many times have we ALL missed that *special moment* because there wasn't any film in the camera, or we had to wait for the flash to get ready? With the PDC 640, that's NEVER a problem! Just pick it up, point and click! And you have that memory, recorded, just like it should be :-)
