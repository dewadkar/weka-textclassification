            I Have an GMC 4DR.Dually Long wheele base 3500 model p.u., its a 1997
model.My vocation is a cattle rancher and I live in Texas, so dont you
think i might know what im talking about! %The truck i have know is
not the truck I* was expecting. The dash is falling apart, I have had many Engine problems,(5 diff.m rep,s of the injector pump alone, covered
by warr. but im at 95000 mls. so the warr. is over). The dash really is
annoying it also makes my C.D.s skip, not to take away from the fact that
I have allready had to replace the bed due to ,mthe fact thatm the metal used to make it were too thin and causedit to break apart,I actually had
to buy a new bed and have it stressed out to accomadate the extra gear I 
outfit my vehicles with.G.M. was notified but had no responce!I really like the way it rides on the hiway,but with less than 5000 miles left on
the warr. I will be trading it off soon.Im Lookin at Fords F3500 also
the Dodge 3500, (still like 4drs and 4 rear wheels). I hope this is help
for a very critical decescion. TFMIII@hotmail.com<br><br>
