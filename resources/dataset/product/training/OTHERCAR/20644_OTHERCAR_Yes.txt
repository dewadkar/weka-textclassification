            First, an admission: I'm not a real &quot;car guy&quot;, meaning that many of the aspects of this superb car, like the tight handling, German engineering, and most of all, the POWER of the turbo engine, while appreciated, were a little wasted on me.  I wanted comfort, quiet, value, looks, durability, and room (real room) for five.  I researched things to death, as usual, and found a lot of what I was looking for in the Toyota Avalon, for a lot less money.  Sharing with a buddy of mine, he said &quot;Rick...is that Avalon WHO YOU ARE?&quot;.  Nah!
The Audi A62.7T is totally cool!  The interior is hands down the most beautiful, tasteful and rich-looking of its class. It's a joy to spend time in. The exterior (I have silver, with a dark grey interior) was pleasing to my eyes at first, but over time, I've come to appreciate how beautiful the design really is! Distinctive, fluid, understated and yet unusual.  Very elegant. The interior is spacious--the back seat coupled with the engine power and price beat out the 528, the closest (only?) serious competition.
That engine...fun!  Maybe I am more of a car guy, now!  I know I'll never go back, now that I've had the pleasure of gently depressing the pedal and rocketing out of a tight merge or other high traffic hazard.  The all-wheel drive is a great safety feature on slippery roads, but I never appreciated the feeling of safety and control that comes from having that immediately available surge of power.
A few other pluses: the trunk is HUGE, the seats (sports seats in mine)are very comfortable (supportive--if you're over 250, maybe a little &quot;tight&quot;),  and the little touches like the lighting system, memory seats, etc. are nice (I have the &quot;warm weather package&quot;, with power rear sunshade, manual side sunshades in the rear, and a solar-powered fan to change the inside air--it makes a huge difference when your car bakes in the Texas summer sun.
Bottom line: a terrific car--no problems at all. If you're a &quot;car guy/gal&quot;, you'll appreciate it at once.  If not, you'll soon understand what the car guys are drooling about!<br><br>
