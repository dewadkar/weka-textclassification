                 ...When my girlfriend had me drive her Chevy Prism (formerly Geo Prism), I must admit that I had low expectations.  In recent history, I've been spoiled with Japanese engineering, and my last memories of an American car were a not-so-well-equipped Bonneville.  After driving her car, I was pleasantly surprised.  Finally, proof-positive that American cars have cleaned up their act and are finally producing quality automobiles again.

      To my shock and amazement, I found the Prism to have a simple and functional interior.  This is perhaps due to the fact that it's the same car as the Toyota Corolla.  I was expecting cheap plastics and awkward gauges (like the old Taurus).  Well, The gauges were large and easy to read, providing vital information.  The radio and climate controls were equally easy to use with large switches that were intuitively placed.  Although they may not have the latest high-tech features, they are all simple and easy to operate.  It's easy to familiarize yourself with these controls and once that's done, you will be able to use the controls without much distraction.

      The style of the car is very middle of the road, and conservatively styled.  It's not going to turn any heads, which is both a good and bad thing.  Still, I tend to like the conservative look, so I like the proportions of this car.  The inside styling is very muted and nothing that will make you turn away in disgust.  The plastics look like they are high quality and there's none of the horrible fake wood that highlights all too many American cars.

      There is ample room in this car.  Passengers in the front seat will be extremely happy with the amount of space they can have.  However, rear passengers may feel a bit cramped, especially on long drives.  The seats are firm and comfortable, but long trips will get to you.  The trunk of this car is extremely large for a car of this size, and should be enough for the average person.

      The car handles extremely well.  It hugs the road, although its weight makes it feel a little light at high speeds.  Still, nothing in the car wobbles or rattles as you speed up.  The engine is quick and delivers ample power for a car this size.  You won't be able to out-accelerate a BMW or anything, but you won't feel like there's a lawnmower engine in the car either.  This car had side airbags as well, a definite plus in a car at this price.  Running on unleaded gas, this car gets good gas mileage that hovers around 30 mpg.

      Overall, I think that this car is a great value.  It's enjoyable to drive and is extremely functional.  There's ample space and nothing really lacking in this car.  My girlfriend picked this car over the Corolla because she was able to get a better lease deal on this car.  Since they share the same parts and only have a few cosmetic differences, I would expect high, Toyota-like quality.  I question whether it's worth paying the premium for a Corolla or a similarly priced Civic.  If you are looking for good value in a small car, the Prism is definitely a great choice.<br><br>
