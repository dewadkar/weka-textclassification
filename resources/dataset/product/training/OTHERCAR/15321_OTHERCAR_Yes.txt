            After months of comparisons, research &amp; saving, I <i>finally</i> purchased a Sony MVC-FD83 Mavica last week. Woohoo!!

Out of all the digital cameras I've checked out, the Sony Mavica's seem to be among of the easiest to use.

When I got home with it, all I had to do was charge up the battery, put in a floppy disk, point, shoot &amp; presto, a perfect picture. It doesn't get much easier than that! 

The menu bar doesn't have too many different control settings, as to confuse the user &amp; is very user friendly. I'm able to see all the functions of the camera on the 2.5&quot; LCD screen. 

Because of the LCD screen viewing, I'm able to see everything around me as I set up for each shot &amp; catch that perfect picture I probably would have missed, had I been looking through a tiny viewfinder with one eye closed. ��~

The Mavica has 3 different size &amp; 2 picture quality settings. Even on the regular quality &amp; smallest size, it produces a very sharp &amp; clear picture. 

It has a self timer, a built in flash, zoom lens, macro, video output jack, auto/manual focus, program settings, picture effects &amp; much more!

One of my favorite features of this camera is the MPEG movie mode. It will allow me to shoot a full 1 minute video clip, with sound &amp; e-mail it to my friends &amp; family. 

Once I shoot my video clip or picture(s), I just take the floppy disk out of the camera &amp; put it in my PC's floppy drive. I don't have to crawl under my desk to connect the camera to my PC.

<i>If you feel that you want or need to be able to record a longer video, my suggestion would to purchase a video camera instead of this one.</i>

It comes with a 2 hour rechargeable battery (NP-F330) &amp; charger. I also picked up the 4 hour battery (NP-F550) to go with it, which runs about $60.00.

<i>Don't buy the NP-F750 battery, I called Sony &amp; they told me it was not compatible with this camera. The 330 &amp; 550 are the only 2 batteries that are.</i>

Gone are the days of my rolls of 35mm film sitting in my junk drawer, waiting for months or even years to be sent in for developing. I can't tell you how many rolls I have that are up to 4 years old that never made it to a photo lab. ;o)

I'll be the first to admit, I'm impatient. I want to see how my pictures turn out, right now!! If I have to wait or take them somewhere, there's a strong possibility that they'll never be seen at all.

No more missing those pictures from that once in a life time trip either.
With this camera, I can instantly look at each picture &amp; decide if I want to keep it or delete it, on the spot. 


When I bought it, I also purchased a camera bag that was made for this sized digital camera. The only down side to this bag is that it doesn't give you much room for anything else in it. 

I wound up taking the bag back a few days later &amp; getting a small video camera bag. Now I have enough room in it to take along a good supply of floppy disks, the charger, extra battery &amp; the instructions.


As I'm sure you can tell, if you're still reading, I can't say enough about how much I like this camera.

In my opinion, this is the best value in a digital camera for the price.<br><br>
