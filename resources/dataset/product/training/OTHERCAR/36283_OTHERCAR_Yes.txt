            I bought this vehicle because it is affordable and high quality.  I have been driving it for two years and have had absolutely no problems (other than a flat tire)  It gets great gas mileage too...about 35 miles per gallon!  It is a compact car, but even so, there is plenty of room for five people to ride comfortably.  Plenty of leg room in the back.  My model is a standard and does not have power locks or power doors...a little inconvenient at time, but all in all I am very satisfied with my car.  If you're looking for a low maintenance, affordable car this is the one for you.
