            We leased a 1999 SLK in April of 1999 as a &quot;fun&quot; car to complement our 1999 Mercedes E320 Sedan.  It is fun to drive, and very flexible.  We love the hardtop convertible!  

However we have been plagued with electrical problems and have had the car in the shop 6 times.  Each time was related to an electrical malfunction. The car had to be hauled to the dealership when the top got stuck halfway down due to a failure of the electrical switch that controls the operation. We never knew when the top was going to work...and when it wasn't.

The switch was replaced but failed again two weeks later and had to be replaced again. This time the dealership replaced the hydraulics as well. And there have been numerous problems with the tail light assemblies burning out and other electrical system issues.  

The Mercedes service department manager finally confided to us that there have been many electrical system problems with some of the 1999 SLK230's and that Mercedes elected not to recall the car but to handle it on a car by car basis.  If you are having problems with your 1999 SLK insist that your dealership involve the Mercedes corporate representative and make sure that they replace and update your electrical system.  That should fix the problem. 

Update - November 2000

We have not had a repeat of the problems with the rooftop open/close mechanism since the last visit...and all the lights are working.  Of course, it is November and even in Southern California, the number of opportunities to drive with the top down is limited so it stays up most of the time.

A new problem has arisen however and will require dealer attention.  A friend of mine in from the east coast for a visit was a passenger in my car this weekend.  When he opened the passenger door he noticed that pieces of the interior panel were falling off.  I took a look at it and apparently the interior door panel is composed of elements that are glued on (vs. using screws etc.) and the glue wasn't holding.  This is not the sort of quality I expect in a $42,000+ car...especially with only 8,500 miles on the odometer.  I am sure this problem, like the others, can be fixed but it means another day at the dealership and another rental car.  That is a major inconvenience in my book.  And its enough to change my recommendation from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;not buy&quot;.

Update Dec. 2000

We sold the SLK back to the dealership.  Mercedes would not take the car back and deferred the issue to the dealership.  The dealership handled it professionally once they knew we were serious about filing a lemon law claim.  We left with a brand-new 2001 ML320.  I've read the reviews of the ML320 here on epinions.com.  We will add our review once we have a few miles on the car.<br><br>
