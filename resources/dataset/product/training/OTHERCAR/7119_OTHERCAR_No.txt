            My husband bought his 10th anniversary miata about 4 months ago.  Personally, I'm not that excited about the whole miata idea, but if he had to get one, I'm glad this is the one that he got.

The 10th anniversary has a lot of unique features:  the beautiful sapphire blue paint, the blue top, special black leather and faux blue suede interior, great bose stereo system (although it only has 2 speakers).  When we bought the car new, we got his and hers matching 10th anniversary miata seiko watches, a small replica of the car in a little plastic case, a special key chain, and a certificate verifying the limited edition # that is on the driver's side of the car; all of this arrived in the mail in a pretty blue velvet box.  This is a &quot;feel good&quot; car. :)

It also has a glass rear window and &quot;built-in&quot; headlights (rather than the cheesy pop-up kinds of the older models).

And standard with all miata models:  the world's smallest trunk, complete lack of moving space when you're in the car, and lack of security.  I am disappointed that this car (especially being such a unique model) did not come standard with an alarm, and that it wouldn't take more than a simple screwdriver to get to any part of the car.  We also have to plan if we are going anywhere, because the truck will fit one overnight bag.  Many shopping trips I have ended up with items on my lap that wouldn't fit anywhere else.

I am 5'10&quot; and feel extremely cramped in the car.  In the passenger seat, my knees are in the dash, and once I'm in the seat, there's no moving around (the seats are comfy, just my knees hurt!).  Getting in and out of the car is like pulling yourself up off the floor!!!  My husband is 5'9&quot; and seems to be comfortable in the driver's seat ... but that's about the maximum height for this car.  It does have a lot of head room, just no leg space.

One nice thing is that you can put the top down while still buckled in your seat, you just reach behind you and pull it over your head.  The top does not seem to be very well insulated ... I've been told the road noise is &quot;part of the experience.&quot;  It seems to get hot/cold pretty fast inside the car.

I have never been in a car that got more looks than this one, the uniqueness really draws your attention to it.  But really, I don't feel safe when I'm riding in it.  They don't even pretend to install a roll-bar, and it is so small I feel like any little fender-bender could put me in the emergency room.

Miatas just aren't for me.  If you love the cars (like my hubby does), then THIS is the one to have .. it's beautiful to look at regardless of the rest. :)<br><br>
