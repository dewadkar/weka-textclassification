            GM did well not to squeeze in the third seat in the regular Envoy/Trailblazer/Bravada platform, opting for a stretched version that is 18" longer than the competing Acura MDX and soon-to-be-launched Honda Pilot.  

I looked closely at the Acura MDX and opted for the Envoy XL.  With the exception of the navigation system, the GMC offers every feature the more pricy Acura does and then some (e.g. Onstar), without the snooty pay-us-a-huge-premium-over-MSRP attitudes of Acura dealers.  The Envoy XL has a very smooth ride, great acceleration, a very powerful 270 hp engine, comfortable seating for 7 including very decent 3rd low leg room, and with the seats folded down a 100 cubic feet of cargo room and capability to tow 5,000+ lbs.  The 1SK package includes the factory-installed 7" DVD with wireless headphones -great for long rides.  I'm not sure the Bose stereo is worth the premium but that's because the base stereo sounds very good.

Our two main criteria were: a) comfortable seating for 7, b) 4WD.  We looked at the Buick Rendezvous (very little luggage room, engine felt slightly underpowered, nice styling and amenities), Acura MDX (great ride, last row was cramped, greedy dealers), Honda Pilot (waiting list), Toyota Sequoia (very roomy, but pricy - SR5 with leather virtually unavailable, Limited costs $7K more!, also handling was rough and very truck-like), Yukon/Tahoe (also very truck-like, and cramped third-row seating), Yukon XL/Suburban (powerful, roooomy! - way too big and unwieldy).
