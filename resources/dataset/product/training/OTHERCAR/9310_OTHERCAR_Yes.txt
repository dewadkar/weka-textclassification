            If you are mechanically inclined, this is the car to have. It has a strong engine, a German transmission, and the need for frequent maintenance. This car requires attention in every area, including looks, which comes naturally with good care.
I bought it used, it had some problems, but I bought as well some repair books and tackled the situation as required. There are great support groups on the Internet, and Jaguar clubs all over the country that help out a lot on questions and other items as parts and mechanics.
I have owned several cars, the ride in this 1987 Jaguar XJ6 is fabulous, the cabin is sound proof, the leather and wood are blended in perfection, and a 4 hour trip feels like a 30 minute commute.
Would recommend for the car-lover but not for someone who needs an everyday car with low maintenance.
