            Car Reviewed: Accord Coupe V6 with Nav

I'll start with the negatives of this car since it's the bugs you usually notice in a car; the good is sublime:

Cons:

The workmanship of this Accord is surprisingly poor compared to last generations.  I've owned a 1998 Accord (first year of that model) and it didn't suffer from the build issues this 03 Accord has.

First, walk to any outdoor dealership and look at the exterior door trim.  I'm willing to bet if it was parked in the sun, the trim is shrinking, and crinkling like heat-shrink-tube.  Next, drive it around over some unsmooth surfaces and listen to the clamour of sounds (as many have complained here already) coming from mysterious spots in the dash, headliner.  The passenger seat rattles when nobody sits on it and many others have confirmed the same thing at the forums of www.vtec.net.  These noises are tough to find, and fix.  I've heard horror stories of dealerships pulling apart the car to fix the noise only to introduce more problems.  My vehicle also came with a bad tire which caused it to pull.  Honda's response basically: "tough cookies...contact the tire manufacturer (you'll be jumping more hoops to get a replacement thnt a circus seal)" 

Pros:

Very quiet ride when on smooth roads.  The seats are very supportive and comfortable.  There is ample power from the V6 (240hp) and it gets it with regular octane.  The rear seating is spacious indeed with plenty of headroom and legroom for the 6 ft crowd.  

The navigation system is very cool, it recognizes your voice commands to adjust things like temperature and radio stations, but I don't like how you have to be in a certain screen to issue certain commands.  For example, I can't issue radio commands while in the A/C section.  With the amount of integration of so many critical functions into this one LCD screen, one wonders of the catastrophes if this one system fails.  I enjoy the audio controls on the steering immensely and use it all the time.  

To be honest, I find myself using voice commands for probably only 1/5th of the time because I can usually do a task much quicker manually without the chance of being misheard (accuracy of recognition I estimate is about 98% when spoken in an ideal environment...75% when less than ideal).  I like the 2/3 foldback seats but as with many Honda's, the clearance to the trunk isn't the width of the entire seats.  Trunk space is spacious for a coupe.

You'll have plenty of fun with the remote control key.  You can lower windows remotely, release the trunk.  You can close the windows VW style with the key.  

The stereo is fantastic acoustically speaking with plenty of punch.  6 CD loader in the front without reaching into the trunk.  

Conclusions:

I'm left scratching my head as to how Honda would let this car out of R&D with some many great features only to be marred by such easily preventable problems!  If they only took the time to test drive it in the real world...who knows...I would be 100% satisfied instead of 79% satisfied.
