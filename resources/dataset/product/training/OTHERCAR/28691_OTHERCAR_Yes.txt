            Well folks, as much as it pains me to say it, my wonderful, lovable, beautiful 92 Mitsubishi Eclipse has been traded in. We shared many laughs, cries, and wax jobs, but it was falling apart, so I traded it in for it's younger, hotter, more flexible cousin, the<b> 2001 Dodge Neon</b>.

I'll save you the details of that car, you can check out that epinion from earlier this year if you feel the need. I've been anxiously awaiting writing this epinion, as I've heard plenty of people saying how much of a horror story the Dodge Neon has become, and I can only pray that the new model will prove a different story in the long run.

I've had my new 2001 Neon for about 2 and a half weeks now, and I'm pleasantly surprised so far at its performance. For a minimal 12,995 dollars after dealer rebates, the value is great, and for a young single guy like myself, all the attributes seem to fit perfectly with my lifestyle. The base options are a sigh of relief that I've long been looking for, and the extra goodies thrown in make the experience even more relaxing and enjoyable.

<b>The Beef</b>
All in all, I can't say there are too many standout negatives with the 2001 Neon. It seems ideal for younger college students or for getting on your feet, but doesn't stiff you on quality.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior was the first thing that hit me with a shock concerning the car. For such a compact vehicle, it's surprisingly roomy and provides plenty of room to stretch out. The biggest problem I had with my 2 door hatchback Eclipse was that there was plenty of room for the driver, but passengers were in for total discomfort, and Mitsubishi made quite sure it would be damned if anyone wanted to ride in the back seat. The Neon, on the other hand, provides a 60/40 split, leaving enough room for 5 people to fit comfortably, or 4 people after all-you-can-eat night at Roscoes Chicken &amp; Waffles. For a 4 door compact sedan, I expected the interior to be much more cramped, but I continuously find myself stopping to take a look around and marvel at the spaciousness. I also still find myself wide-eyed over the trunk, I wasn't lying in the title, the first thing that hit me when I opened the trunk was &quot;Wow, if I ever need to dispose of any full-grown bodies, it'll be a breeze!&quot; From a less maniacal standpoint, there's enough room for plenty of groceries, bags, or luggage in case of a rushed flee for the border.

<b>Exterior</b>
Of course, being a child of the 80's, the materialistic aspect is well-known was the most important. Once again, the 2001 Neon doesn't disappoint, proudly showing off it's sleek, dynamic design. The particular model I chose was a hunter green SE 4 door with 15 inch alloy rims. The body is sporty and pleasing to the eye, but still maintains a sense of integrity. The only complaints I have with the exterior design of the 2001 Neon is that the paint job seems to be paper-thin, and I'm just waiting for it to fade and peel. I also doubt it'll provide even half-assed resistance to dents and scratches. Also, the engine is lower than usual, probably for space reasons, and the hood area is extremely small, so I have the impending feeling that there isn't much more than a flimsy piece of plastic protecting the driver in case of a collision. The design itself is good for eye-candy, but hopefully I won't have to come back and complain about the flimsy build.

<b>Engine</b>
The first thing that struck me upon test driving the 2001 Neon was that it accelerates surprisingly well for a 4 cylinder. It doesn't have the same kick my Eclipse gave, but from a non-machismo aspect, the acceleration is clean and precise. The car boasts a reasonable 2.0 litre, 16 valve, 4 cyl. engine which seems to work quite nicely, nothing overly flashy, but it leaves nothing to complain about either. Everything under the hood is easily accessible, all the fluids can be reached with ease, which proves very beneficial in contrast to other vehicles. One thing people have seemed to have numerous problems with in previous years' Neons was the transmission. While I can't say the transmission in the 2001 model is anything to douse your drawers over, I haven't experienced any instances of it lagging or slipping so far, and hopefully it'll remain that way.

<b>Pimped out (Options)</b>
Whichever 2001 Dodge Neon package you choose, a host of options can be selected. My personal pick came with standard AM/FM-Cassette, A/C, heat, power windows and door locks, power trunk, and defrosting side mirrors in case of cold conditions. For extras, I opted for the sunroof and 4 disc CD changer for a minimal extra charge. The 2001 Neon also boasts a 6 speaker surround sound system, which is a definite bonus. I've moved my dual 12 inch subwoofers and amps into the trunk, still leaving ample room, but I plan to leave the 6 factory speakers as they are, as they work surprisingly well even without upgrading. This pleases me quite immensely. I can now rest easily and enjoy my automobile with loud, obnoxious sounds bumping. One of the main extras I enjoy with my Neon is the keyless entry system. Boy, I can't get enough of this little deal. With the click of a button, all doors can be unlocked, including the trunk, and an automatic alarm can be set off. This provides hours of entertainment for the easily-amused like myself. To go the whole 9, one can also opt to equip the Neon with leather interior and side airbags, adding an extra yard of safety in addition to the driver and passenger side standard airbags.

All in all, I can't find that many things to complain about with the 2001 Dodge Neon. The extras and options provide a more relaxed, enjoyable ride. The car flows butter-smooth, making the driver and passengers comfortable for hours of road time, and the under the hood goodies provide a reasonable, efficient base. The value is extraordinary, and I'm very pleased with my 2001 Neon so far. Hopefully I'll remain that way for a long time to come.<br><br>
