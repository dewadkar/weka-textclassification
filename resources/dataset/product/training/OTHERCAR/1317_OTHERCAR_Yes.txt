            I've come to the party late but I've been impressed so far.  My Passport is just turning over 190,000 miles. Oh my gosh it uses a quart of oil between changes ! My right side valve cover gets dirtier than the left - But I park inside and the floor is stain free. When it idles or is revved it has no obvious burnt oil smell and the tailpipe  / emissions-check says it is first rate. In Kentucky you get all kinds of weather and that can be in the same weekend. I am truely happy to have my passport and gladly pay at the pumps for the 15-18 gallons city/suburb

* Can I complain about it -- Sure I can. I can"t get the seat belt to go around my big winter coat. When the wind chill is 12 below zero and it is snowing hard the last thing you want to do is stand outside and remove your coat.  My $#%@# 98 Malibu can go around but the Honda PASSPORT won't and HONDA flat out refuses to sell extenders at any price. I'm over 6 foot and the seating is just fine but in Kentucky you must wear your belt and I can"t do it and be warm too. 

The Dash lights are not bright and the radio is dark  has such small controls that the bouncy ride makes changing the channel a challenge. I usually wait till I stop or have 1/2 mile of open road before attempting anything short of turning it off. 

Over all It is really a very dependable hard working TRUCK that has seating and comforts of an SUV. It is not a glorified Mini van or a soccer-moms dream. The bone heads that think the Passport is too fuel inefficient should check out the 2 seater sports cars. They can"t haul 3 kids bookbags and a desktop computer with monitor. The passport can with room for groceries on the way home.   The book price was 28,925 new and I bought it used for 6,250. 
You can't beat it.
