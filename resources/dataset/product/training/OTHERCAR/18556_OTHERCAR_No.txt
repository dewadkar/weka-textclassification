            I happen to own a 1987 Olds Ciera Sedan. It's one of the best used cars I bought. It has the 3.8 V6 motor and is extremely good on gas. Even with over 100,000 miles. I would recomend this car to anyone thinking about buying one. I live in Pennsylvania and driven this car to VA Beach 9 times this summer. It's a 6 hour ride and I did not have one problem. It's very comfortable to sit in and with cruise control the ride was very easy. I would have to say the only downfall of this model (and it's only the this engine type) is that it's all electronic, no distributor. Which makes it just a little harder to work on.  <br><br>
