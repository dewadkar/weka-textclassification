                This is my first digital camera I ever used, and I really love it. I think the fact that it has a stainless steel body makes it look really great, and not only that,but it makes it durable. 
   
     The S230 is called "The World's smallest 3 MegaPixel Camera". It's no joke either.  It fits practically anywhere!!!. It has a 2X zoom lens, and 6.4X combined. The good thing is that the lens comes out when you turn it on, and as you zoom in and out more or less. When you turn it of it retracts completely. 
    
     The picture quality is great, as I've mentioned.  What impressed me the most when I first got it was the fact that you could take a picture in a room completely in the dark, and the result will be a great lit picture of professional quality.  It was amazing!!!!  You take a picture at night with your friends, not really see it clearly in the LCD, but still have a great picture in the end.  The flash is amazing!!!!  You can also shoot Black and white pictures if you want to, and they look great too.  Those are my favorite.

     This camera also lets you take little 3 minute movies. I know that's not a whole lot.  But this camera is more based on the pictures that it can take.

     Is it easy to use?  Yeah the basic of the camera are real easy to learn, it's all the other features that take a while to learn.
