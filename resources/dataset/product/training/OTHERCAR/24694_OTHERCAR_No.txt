            After buying numerous used vehicles over the years, my husband and I decided in late 1998 that it was time to lease a brand new vehicle.  After all, we deserved the peace of mind a new vehicle brings.  Right?  That peace of mind was unfortunately short-lived.  
We initially were drawn to the Venture by the fact that it seated eight passengers safely and had sliding doors on the driver and passenger sides.  The van drove smoothly and we felt it was the perfect vehicle for a busy family of five.  
Within the first six months, the air bag light malfunctioned.  OK.  No big deal.  Shortly thereafter, the breaks began to squeal and soon our &quot;new&quot; van was really turning heads.  Not for it's sleek look or vibrant color, but for the awful sound it emitted at each stop or yield.  Since we had a 1000 mile road trip planned, we of course rushed our Venture to the dealer who &quot;deglazed&quot; the brake pads.  This high-tech procedure did absolutely nothing and when we tried to get some answers about &quot;why?&quot;, we were told that since the asbestos has been removed from brake pads, the metal shaving that replaced them cause squealing.  Well, if this is the case, I guess all vehicles should be grinding and squealing.  But--they ARE NOT.  Although, I have noticed several other Ventures emitting the same wonderful noises.  A couple months later the electric door locks also malfunctioned making it impossible to open one of the sliding doors using the convenience of the unlock button.   
Our most recent development is equally as wonderful though.  Tomorrow I take my &quot;new&quot; van back in because the &quot;service engine soon&quot; light is now illuminated.  Wow!  I was beginning to the miss that service manager anyway.  The adventure continues.  So, if you're looking for adventure the Venture is for you.  Seize the day!<br><br>
