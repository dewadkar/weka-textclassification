            I know that the 1990 4runner may be a little pricey considering it's a ten year old vehicle, but I've had mine for almost 2 years and I haven't had to touch it.  It runs every day, I drive it everywhere, and it's in the exact same shape it was when I bought it.  It's a well built vehicle.

If you're looking for something that won't break down (and who isn't?), this truck is a rare find.  Although you may feel like you're shelling out a little more cash than you might want to for an older vehicle, the resale value on these things is never going to go down (until gasoline prices skyrocket and everyone is driving Firefly's around).  It's not great on gas, and it doesn't have the most horsepower in its class, but I'm not driving 30 miles to and from work everyday, so it doesn't bother me, and power doesn't mean much to a city driver.

The main reason I would recommend this truck is that it IS ten years old.  All of the flaws have been discovered, and the truth has come out: this truck won't die.  I have 110,000 Miles on mine, and all I've had to do to it is get some oil changes, do a tune up, and rotate the tires.  

It's also beautiful.  Mine is fully loaded, and the sunroof is gigantic.  The amount of stuff you can put in the back will astonish you, and the rear window slides down easily from the drivers seat so you can hang things out the back.  It's amazing.  If you've been thinking about buying one of these, I recommend you find one you like and do it.  Its only drawback is fuel-consumption, but you wouldn't be reading this if you were looking for an economy car!

this is an update:
so i moved 3000 miles, and decided not to bring my beloved truck with me.  believe me, everyone who knows me and knows my truck knew that this was a hard decision on me.  I sold this beauty in November of 2001, and i still have all the same things to say about at a year later as i did when i wrote this article.  i had it for three years, and it was a gem.  the buyer interest in my truck was astounding and i sold it in 3 days at a great price.  my experience was so incredible (my brother owns a new jeep grand cherokee and he put more money into his in 6 months than i did in three years!) that i'm buying a 1998 model in the next 6 months. 

i used to own a 1988 cherokee (before the 1990 4runner) and it was the biggest lemon i've ever had.  dependability is paramount in a vehicle, so do yourself a favor and buy the 1990 4runner.  :)
