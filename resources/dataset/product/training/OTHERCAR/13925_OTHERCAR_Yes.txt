            We searched around alot and came to Saturn never buying one before. When we first drove it out we liked the sporty look, the good performance, and the seats that adhere to your body, along with the great options (IE cd player, cruise, PW, PL, etc...). The dealership was great and financing was awesome (.09%) which helped close the deal. We have had the car for about 1 month now and the performance is still good but we have noticed when trying to accelerate on the highway it has a slight problem with pickup. It drives smooth and it is a very comfortable car to ride in. The back is large enough for our family and the seats fold down to allow us to place large items in the trunk. This was important to us cause we traded in a pickup truck for the car. Overall the price is great for what we got. The car is made rock solid, not cheap plastic like we noticed on other vehicles, therefore we feel safe inside it while driving.
