            Bought this vehicle after searching and researching everything out there.  Looked at the Honda Odyssey but honestly was too big and way too expensive.  Honda Dealer didn't want to budge on price since this vehicle is in high demand. Liked many features of the Honda, so looked around for something similar.


Fast forward to the Mazda Dealer....  Took one look at the vehicle and instantly liked it.  A little sportier and smaller looking than the Honda.  Had many of the same features and when we test drove it, ACTUALLY road and handled better than the Honda!  More power and smoother transmission.  Kids love the rear pass. roll down windows...way cool! And best of all, has the rear "magic" disappearing bench seat.  

The not so good.........

Bought the LX (didn't want the leather seats).  Wished that we ordered one with the rear A/C. A/C was pulling double duty yesterday (101 degrees). We froze in the front while the kids were "comfortable" in the back.  Carpet is cheap! Make sure you spring for (or have thrown in) the MPV mats.  No plastic cover on the dead pedal??? See a hole coming here in no time.  Center tray only available on the ES model and can't even buy as an option on LX or dealer install??  DON'T BUY THE MUD FLAPS FROM THE DEALER! Cheap plastic and paid over $110.00...Ouch, sucker!

UPDATE 10/29/02 (5100 mi) :  Still very happy with the vehicle.  Opinions haven't changed much. Now I know what the other person meant by "rotten egg smell"  Lasted for about 2 months, then went away (cat.converter).  Appears to be getting zoomier by the day...look out soccer moms! Plenty of room after all for our family of 5. Glad I didn't go HUGE.  Carpet still cheap. Feature I didn't mention before is the "side-by-slide" middle row seats.  Excellent mechanism, smooth, and makes getting into the rear bench simple.  

UPDATE 01/10/03: Still happy with the van. Not sure what reviewer "BrianCam" refers to when he says it's slow and choppy (I'm getting mid 8's 0-60,try that in a Caravan!). Handling above average. Anyway, front and rear heater work good and with about 14 inches of snow on the ground, traction is good with traction control off and slightly better with it turned on. 

UPDATE 03/12/03: Just returned from a Florida Vacation with the family.  Enjoyed the van very much.  Ride was great, room was good for a family of 5.  85 to 95 mph on I-95 and handled like a car with absolutely no sway. Observed 24-25 MPG going pretty fast, so I was happy with that. Put a total of 3600 miles on the van with no problems.  Flip over back seat was great for parking on Daytona Beach, very cool!

UPDATE 11/08/03:  26,000 plus on the odometer and still running great.  No problems with the van so far.  Replaced the tires due to rear "cupping" problem.  Dealer put on the alignment machine only to find it was "dead on".Turned out to be my fault since I've never rotated the tires...oops. Charged me only an hours labor to remove, mount, balance and reinstall my new tires. Can't say enough about the Mazda service...outstanding.  Other than the new tires and oil changes, I have yet to perform any "unscheduled" maintenance on the vehicle.  Very happy with that.
