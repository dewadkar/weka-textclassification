            Well, after driving nearly every competent car under $30,000.00 (the Nissan Maxima, Toyota Avalon and Subaru Legacy to be specific) I came to the conclusion that not only for the money but the best overall performing car and dealer network was the Saturn LS-2. The smooth and powerful V6 is clearly noteworthy. This strong engine is mated with the smoothest of auto transmissions I have ever experienced. The one thing it did that took me by surprise was, as I came flying down a mountain canyon highway (at 85mph) it actually held it's speed without the need for the usual nursing of brake pedal to keep it under control. In fact the car was utterly stable and didn't lean or waver at all. The fastest I ever came down that canyon was at 70mph with a death grip on the wheel and some perspiration included. The sun roof was opened and even my wife commented that there was nearly a complete absence of any wind noise, and that is quite unusual as in my 850 Volvo I just sold, the wind noise was substantial. The suspension communicates what is going on with the road without it becoming an annoyance. This is also important when you drive on icy or snowy roads in the winter. It is a distinct advantage to know when it is slippery and not. The Nissan and Toyota are so isolated from the road that you have no idea what's going on in these situations. The traction control is certainly a big help here too. I have read much about the seats and if anything they aren't saying enough. I spent the last 6 years driving in some of the nicest car seats made (a 1994 850 Volvo) and these have it beat big time. Lower back support isn't fake as in just a bump in the lower back, but rather a continuously proper curve from the lower back up to the shoulder. I can sit in a perfectly upright position in comfort for the first time in a car. I did opt for the leather and am extremely happy with it's quality. The primary reason I trusted it was that the day I test drove the car with leather interior, it was a 80 degree day and my back never got warm enough to sweat. A testament to the breathability of the leather. I travel for a living from Pittsburgh to the West Coast and see every driving condition you can imagine. The trunk sure comes in handy with it's cavernous size, as it will gobble up several large suitcases with room to spare. With the power, control and comfort the LS affords it's driver, I couldn't ask for more. The car has exhibited no issues or problems, and is as tight as a drum with no rattles or creaks. I find the ride to be extraordinarily supple and controlled at the same time. This is a car that could easily satisfy a family of 4 or a single person interested in a quality built, great handling car. I am more convinced each day that I drive it, that this was the right decision. So much so that my wife ordered a LS-1 loaded for herself. She too was so impressed with it's utilitarian capabilities (hauling our pet bunnies to the vet, groceries home from the store or plants home from the nursery. All in all the car is a sleeper and my personal opinion would be that &quot;to drive it is to love it&quot;. A back to back test drive with anything near it's class will only confirm this.<br><br>
