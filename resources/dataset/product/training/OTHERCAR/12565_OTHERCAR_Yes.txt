            Chevrolet Corvette Z06, 2002

Not my Cup of Tea?

When I travel, I do like to rent cars I would not normally buy.

Most of the time when I turn the car in, I know why this particular vehicle is not for me but occasionally I am surprised and do change my mind about that car. 

Once I even went on to purchase a Ford Explorer which until I rented one I felt that it was not my cup of tea. 

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The 2002 Corvette Z06 has the look of the Vette; it is probably one of the easier automobile to identify on the road. 

The one I drove was a bright red, the front end is very low and the rear is raise. This kind of gives it a Lamborghini
shape. It rides very close to the ground, I guess it is for better traction.

This car is very low, you really sit-down and slide-in in a Corvette. There is a feeling of power once the engine is turned-on and you hold the steering in your hands. 

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The interior is a little tight, but after this entire car is for the young and slim elite. I did manage to slide in. 

The leather seats are very comfortable that is if you like driving a car lying down. If you have a back injury like I do, I do not recommend you go on a long drive in the Corvette.

The Z06 is fully equipped; it comes standard with air conditioning, power windows, door locks and mirrors. Plus tilt steering wheel, cruise control and rear window defrost. 

The sound system is excellent and I was surprised. Also standard is an AM/FM CD player radio, with four speakers.

All the gauges are easy to see and all controls are within easy reach. The front and side views are excellent but rear view can be a challenge.

The exterior:

Is very stylish as Corvette is always. Yes, you will be noticed in this car.

The car is mounted on a set of alloyed wheels, and has only 3.7 inches in clearance. If youï¿½re planning to go for a romantic picnic with your love one in this Corvette both of you better be on a diet. The cargo volume is only 25 cubic
feet.

THE ROAD TEST

Once the engine is started you can immediately feel the power. It does feel good to sit behind the wheel of a Corvette.

Driving around city limit can be boring, unless you are turned on by young girls waving at every corners.

But taking this car for a ride on a beautiful country road now that is great.

In the early eighties, I owned a 450Sl and I remember that this was also the type of driving with the top down I enjoyed the most.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

This was only the second time I have driven a Corvette; the first one was a little bit longer than this one. I must admit that Corvettes are a great car to drive and own, if it is your cup of tea.
