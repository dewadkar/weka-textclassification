            As I have grown up and driven a multitude of cars via germany, japan and the US. BMW has set the standard.  I own a 1996 328 convertible sport package
SAFETY
Having been in 3 accidents as a passenger, I know that another persons lack of judgement will only hurt me and never kill me in a BMW. Its not the structure of the body, but the direct connection to the road that you always know and feel where you are going. YOU DO BECOME A BETTER DRIVER 
HANDLING
Often going around turns at speeds recommended is never a challenge for any BMW. If the sign says &quot;upcoming turn 25 mph&quot; I simply double the number and take the turn with ease. &quot;BIPS BMW RULE&quot; As you know your car, BMW tires do tend to wear out faster, this is mostly due to the style of driving which one  often appreciates/acquires after several thousand miles of driving.
 
BRAKES
The brake rotors never heated up and never get weak, even in the midst of a hot summer day roaring around the backroads to encounter stop signs. As the pads are carbon based, brake dust accumulates faster than typical brake pads, but the dust never affects the performance; and is easy to clean due to the allow wheels. Presently 70k, I still do not have to change the pads. 
ACCELERATION
Simply, my 328 does 0-60 in 6.9 sec, which gives me a great head start on other cars. The 328 makes it fun to redline every shift and feel the G forces at your back, you only realize how fast you are going if you check the speedO, otherwise it's hard to discern speed. The size of the car is massive relative to the feel when you are driving, it feels like a small midsize due to the 50/50 weight distribution and you will easily know if you are going to slip. With Z rated tires, I have tried but have never slipped. 
TRACTION CONTROL
With Z rated tires, I have never been stuck in the snow in Pittsburgh. The full traction control is brilliant. 
RELIABILITY
With the 328 specifically, some people have had problems with little glitches in the electrical system, but I have not. Every 6 months or so the ASC-T light comes on when I start the car, but just restart and it will go away. The stereo is flawless, although it sound very good not excellent , it somehow makes wornout dusty tapes sound good. 
SERVICE
IF YOU DEVELOP A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE ASSOCIATE AT ANY BMW DEALER, HE OR SHE WILL GET TO KNOW YOU AND SOMETIMES GIVE DISCOUNTED PARTS AND OR SERVICE. BMW SERVICE IS EXCELLENT, JUST AVOID THE SMOOTH TALKERS THEY HAVE NO FACTS ONLY GENERAL ONE LINERS, AS THEM A TECH QUESTION LIKE SKIDPAD FOR SPECIFIC SERIES, THAT WILL GIVE THEM A GOOD HINT 

SPORTS PACKAGE
Has 225\50\16 z rated tires, this package make the handling impeccable. After owning the car for over 2 yrs and 50000miles, I am still afraid to take turns at high speeds because the potential is endless, the skidpad at .87 is very good, but the Z rated tires and superior handling make is possible to take recommended 25 mph sharp turns at 60-70mph.
PRICE
As the price is often &quot;more&quot; the enjoyment of driving especially on the highway with an average of 32 MPG, is perplexing considering how much power is at my feet, but the VANOS SYSTEM does wonders for my gas expenditures. 
FINAL COMMENTS
IF YOU WANT TO BUY A CAR AND KEEP IT FOR MORE THAN 5YRS I RECOMMEND A BMW,THE CAR TENDS TO GROW ON YOU AND ACTS LIKE AN EXTENSION OF YOUR BODY CONNECTING TO THE ROAD. MY OLD 1987 325IS IS STILL RUNNING FLAWLESSLY AT 155K MILES WITH FULL POWER, WITH ONLY $1000 INVESTED IN THE PAST 14 YRS..BEAT PLANNED OBSECELENCE <br><br>
