            There are lots of comparisons with the ES300 to the Toyota Camry.  Before I bought the ES300 from my friend I drove a Camry.  Let me tell you that there are BIG differences between the two cars.  Although their engines are reported to be the same the ES300 is a lot more quite and offer a very smooth ride.  The leather interior and the premium sound system simply make the ES300 a complete different beast than the Camry (mine went on forever, way over 200k miles).

Although at the time of writing this car is over 5 years old it is still extremely quite.  My mother drives the 2000 Lexus RX300 and my car is just as quite despite having less horse power.  Maybe this is because the ES300 only has 18k miles but still this car is super smooth.  I easily go over 90 MPH on highways because the car is so quite and powerful!  I believe that if you take care of this car well it will last even longer than the Camry.    

The cotrol panels in the ES300 are great, like the Camry.  You could easily see the displays and to see how fast you are going and the time.  There are no glares or anything like that which might affect your driving.  The layout for the buttons for the stereo system are easy to figure out, and you could easily fast forward or rewind songs on your CDs/tapes without looking down.  The thing with the CD is that the changer is located in the back trunk rather than the glove compartment unlike the newer Lexus cars.  One thing I do have problem is the cup holder.  It pops out right below the stereo buttons, so if you put drinks there it makes it difficult to change songs because the cup/can would go right infront of the stereo buttons.    

The ES300 offers a LOT of room.  The car is very long, which is both a good thing and a bad thing because of parking.  There are enough room in the car to fit 5 people comfortably.  the leather on the '95 ES300 is a bit harder than European cars.  Newer Lexus cars offer softer leather. 

The service for Lexus is really good, and the price shows.  The lexus dealer charges you a lot more to do anything than for the Camry.  However, you also get to drive other new Lexus cars if you are in for major tuneups/repairs.  

Overall I think this is a GREAT car and offers good value.  Consumer Reports rated it the most reliable car in the US.  I have no complaints about this car and encourage other car buyers in the range to try out a Lexus.  My father had driven a Volvo and a Mercedius 300E before and he even said the ES300 is better.  It is a lot cheaper too!  Other than the price, the only reason why people shouldn't buy this is if they don't like driving a long car.  It is harder to park the ES300 in cities.
