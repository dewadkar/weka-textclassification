            The Toshiba was my very first digital camera and it taught me a lot about what to look for in a camera.  Despite all of those attractive quality, the one thing that matters the most was not up to par... the image quality.   It had a great sturdy and compact body, built-in usb connection, 2.1 megapixel, and best of all it was just $350.   After half a year of extensive use of digital cameras I've learned one thing.  A digital camera is not great because of the large amount of cool gadgets the manufacture squeezes in; what makes a great digital camera is one that can produce pictures that can meet or surpass the quality from 35mm films.    

The pictures from the Toshiba were generally sharp, however, it almost always came out underexposed.   In many instances I had to set exposure close to +2 EV!   In bright sunlight pictures came out dark and with a bluish tint.   Color correcting with an image editor may seem like not that big of a deal, but when you have to color correct almost every single picture it becomes a huge hassle!  

My advice to anyone who plans to spend around 400 dollars for a digital camera is to buy the Nikon 800.   The Nikon Coolpix 800 when bought from Mercata can be as low as $350!   This is of course after the $75 dollar rebate and when you use the $100 Mercata dollars (you receive when you first sign up).   Use the money you save to buy an usb compactflash reader and you are all set.   This is what I did.  The advantage this camera has over the Toshiba are:

1)  The CP800 has great picture quality.   Very few of my pictures needs to be edited before i send them off to be printed

2)  It has better support.  More people own this camera, therefore, message boards are filled with Nikon CP800 talks.   These people can help you with tips and tricks and any other question you have.  

3) There are a lot more accessories that support the Nikon CP800.  The CP800 allows you to fit add-on lenses.  There is a wide variety from polarizers to wide angle lenses to telescopic lenses.

4) Optical zoom.  2X .  Digital zoom on the Toshiba is useless.   It is just like zooming in with an image editor and cropping the picture.  

These are just a few reasons to get the Nikon CP800.   Hurry before the rebate expires!
