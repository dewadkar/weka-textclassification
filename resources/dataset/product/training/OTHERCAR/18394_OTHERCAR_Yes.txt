            I did some research before buying a 2nd digital camera for my family. I searched a lot of sites and saw a lot of "cheap" cameras.  Dealtime had the best site for reviews that I could find. Steve's Digicam was nice but did not have every camera that I wanted to look at. We have a very nice Canon Powershot S200, which takes top quality photos.  So it was interesting to compare it to the Vivitar V3500, an older model with less Megapixels.<p>
I bought the camera new on Ebay in June 2003.  The V3500 takes quality photos and the battery life has been greater than expected. We use NI-mh rechargeable.   The camera was purchased for my 9-year-old son and he has already learned all the functions and enjoys taking photos.  The LCD is clear, though not as clear as the Canon S200.  We don't use the LCD to take photos as it just wastes the battery and you can see your photo once you&#146re done.  I really like the macro feature, as I think it works better than it does on the Canon. The only negatives I have found are that the zoom tends to make the image "fuzzy" and that the date and time are not saved when the batteries run down.  Our canon has an internal battery just for this purpose, but the Vivitar does not. But, the settings are easily reset.  <p>Our camera came with a 16MB compact flash card, case, ac adapter, TV adapter, and serial adapter.  No USB capabilities.  However, purchasing a compact flash card reader is really the way to go.  If you get a 6-in-1 reader you really have all you will ever need. The are relatively cheap!<p>I would definitely recommend purchasing the Vivitar 3500 if you get the chance.  My next step is to see if I can format a larger capacity compact flash card for this camera.  It says it only takes a 48mb card, however, I have read that others have used 128mb cards.  We shall see!  A 32 or 64mb card is probably all you would really need anyway.  That would be more than 4 rolls of 24 exp. film at normal resolution.  <p> June 15th, 2003 An update to my trial of using a larger card in this camera.  I formatted the 256mb card using the V3500 and it worked just fine.  So you can use a compact flash card larger than that stated by the manufacturer.
