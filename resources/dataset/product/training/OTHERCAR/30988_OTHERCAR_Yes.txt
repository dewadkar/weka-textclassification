            Wow, flash there it goes boy was ours nice as fast as a speeding bullet black like the night it was very aerodynamic, and fast. It was also very powerful I had so much fun in it I believe it was worth every single penny that I paid for it, it was just so much fun to drive so flashy and so impressive I personally loved it. The interior layout I thought was very nice the air conditioning worked very well and the sound system was very impressive. The convertible top went down very quickly and I thought that it was pretty easy to deal with it was great in warm weather.<br><br>
