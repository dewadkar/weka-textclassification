            In 1995 my parents decided that they needed a new minivan. Their old 1988 Voyager was dying and they needed a good replacement. They bought a 1995 Voyager with 35k miles on it and have had it ever since, now approaching 122k miles. This van has served my family very well. It has gone through numerous trips, various beatings, and 2 small boys. And although the van has its good points, it also has its bad points. 

The Good:
I love the power that this van makes. It has the 3.3L V6 with a Holley TBI on it. It will absolutely fly. My friends have coined it the &quot;Supervan&quot; because of how fast it is, especially with the back seats out. The van has also been very reliable. It hasn't ever broken down or left us on the side of the road. It is also very good on gas and rides very nice.

The Bad:
It is very awkward for me, a 6'5&quot; tall guy, to sit in any of the seats in the van. When driving the van, it feels like you are driving a bus because of the steering wheel layout. The back seats are cramped and I can't even fit into the back seat. There is also not much cargo room, which necessitates a rooftop bubble for long trips. The van also blew the tranny at 112k miles, partially due to the fact that the fluid was changed , which should never be done.

The Ugly:
The van is beginning to show the effects of Chrysler paint - chipping and flaking! Why can't they seem to get that right?

Overall this van has been excellent and my parents will drive it till the wheels fall off.<br><br>
