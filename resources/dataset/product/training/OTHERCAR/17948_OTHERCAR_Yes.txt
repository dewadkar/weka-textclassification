                  When My son asked for his first car and he wanted a jeep  i was a little bit skeptical in puchasing one due to the safety hazards everyone hears about.  Many people say that they are not safe SUV's because they have the tendency to flip over, and at first thought so too.  Both my son and I did a lot of research to see if this was the right vehical for him to have, and as it turned out it was.  While doing research we found out that the center of gravity was lowered in the 1998 models so we decided to go with that.  The jeep rides like you are driving in the sky with the high tech Quadra-coil suspension it soaks up the bumps like a sponge.  Not only a great suspension but a great engine standard with a 2.5L we decided to upgrade to a 4.0L and boy it can move with good acceleration. We are totaly satisfied with or jeep for a little over a year have not had one problem or shop visit.  Not only does he love he jeep i love it to it makes me feel like a kid again driving with the top down.  To my knowledge  i have never felt like we were going to tip over or any thing like that and  i think if your thinking about buying one go for it!  <br><br>
