            The Lexus RX300 is definitely the best of Luxury and Utility.  This vehicle rides like a car as opposed to other SUVs that feel like a farm truck.  The amenities far exceed those found in other SUVs that (with options) cost about the same.  This is quite an accomplishment for a vehicle that sports all-wheel-drive, a feature that comes into play no in snow but also on wet roads.

One cannot own a Lexus without commenting on the buying experience and after sale service.  Our dealer is excellent in both regards.  In fact, I'd pay 5000 more for the lexus to avoid the service departments of our local Ford &amp; GM dealers.

There is however one annoying feature.  The turning radius is not as tight as I would like.  My LS400 turns shorter, and when switching between vehicles one can be fooled in the RX300 when attempting tight turns.

Overall...the best SUV available<br><br>
