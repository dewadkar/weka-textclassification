            I'm going to make this review short and to the point. This is one great car. As far as I'm concerned, I will not be getting another car for a long while, and that is almost all due to the fact that I enjoy this BMW so much. It's great features and outstanding handling make it one of the best cars out there right now in my eyes.
One of the things that I noticed when I first laid my eyes on the car was that the front wheels are positioned closer to the front of the vehicle, giving it outstanding handling. You can actually feel the difference when driving this car, and let me tell you, it is a great experience. 
The interior of the car is very comfortable, and the seats are covered with high quality leather that looks great and feels great. One of the options I like best about the car is it's little mini computer in the dashboard.
This small computer does many tasks, such as calculate miles driven, miles left on the gas tank, temperature, time, and other neat tasks. This can be very useful, especially the miles left in tank feature. This feature means I will probably never run out of gas again, which is cool to think about. 
I bought this vehicle because I wanted a car that could live up to my standards. I was tired of having to live up to other cars standards. The BMW lives up to my standards, and then some. I am completely happy with my purchase.
If you want a great car that you won't run down for many years, I suggest looking into one of these great vehicles. The price is a little steep, but if you can get around this, I highly suggest this vehicle. 
Thanks for your time, I hope you enjoyed this review.<br><br>
