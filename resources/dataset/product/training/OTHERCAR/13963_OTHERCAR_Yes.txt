            Roadsters have been popping up here and there since Miata became a sales success in 1989.  So far the only Japanese competitor against the Mazda has been the S2000, but this car costs nearly twice as much as a Miata.  The cute little roadster has also lost its image with the ever increasing automobile prices.  It used to cost somewhere near 10k, but nowadays a fully equiped Miata costs almost as much as a mid-size sedan at around 23k.  

German roadsters are not unlike the S2000 in terms of cost.  Although they offer actual performance, Porshe Boxter, BMW Z3 and the Mercedes SLK are expensive exotics.  The original cheap roadster for average Joe image is only being followed by the Miata, and not too successfully at that.  This vehicle has gone unchallenged for too long, and it seems like Toyota has intentions of changing that forever.  Its new MR2 Spyder is a 2 seater that will become the only roadster in Miata's price range.

Import enthusiasts are not unfamiliar with the name MR2.  The car has the typical Japanese sports car history that begun in mid 80's.  The original MR2 came to US first as a 4-banger geared at a young audience who couldn't afford insane insurance rates.  The car was slow, but it looked sporty.  Unfortunately, looking sporty was not enough, and soon we had a Turbocharged version of the MR2.  Turbocharging is an expensive technology, and thus the MR2 started costing a ridiculous 30k.  It fell from the market in mid 90's, suffering the same fate as Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX (and possibly what will happen to 3000).

Now the MR2 is being re-introducted with its originally intended outlook.  Its a cheap roadster that your average Joe can buy, but with Miata in the market for over 10 years, it needs to be a better car in order to dig its own buyer niche.  And looking at the car's characteristics, it seems like Toyota will be an utter success.

First of all, the MR2 is a gorgeous vehicle.  It looks compact and sporty, almost like something that came out of a cartoon.  Its not as stupidly futuristic as the new Celica, nor is it a copy of the Grand Am like the Eclipse.  However, its still a hybrid of many other things.  The car looks something like a cross between a Boxter and an S2000, with 5 star rims and completely decorative side skirts.  Its a sweet car, a perfect copy of an exotic racer.

Nevertheless, this is NOT an exotic racer.  Its a cheap roadster, and usually they lack in terms of performance.  MR2 is a 4-banger with Variable Timing technology.  Its fuel efficient and won't carry the insane insurance rates of other sports cars, but it can only output 138HP.  With a torque of 125lbs/ft, by the time this car hits 0-60 you can light a cigeratte and even take a couple of relaxed puffs.  As it is being newly introduced, the only tranny offered is a 5-speed manual.  Compare it to other sports cars, and you have a lawn mover.  However, compare it to its direct competitor, the Miata, and its HP output is exactly where it should be.  These 2 cars will go head to head in a drag race.  But anyway, I doubt you would be reading this if you want to drag.

Perhaps the one reason because of which this car will steal Miata's market is the fact that it has better interior.  Nope, no more contemplating for minutes before getting inside the car, and no more moving and fiddling your bum until you find a comfortable position.  

MR2 is a worthy competitor to the Miata, but nothing more.  Its not a red light screamer, but that doesn't mean its not a head turner.  Its a gorgeous car, with a mid-engine and wishbone suspension that provides decent handling unlike the earlier Miata's.  If you are in the market for a roadster, definitely check this one out.  Although, it being an introductory vehicle, I wouldn't recommend buying it until it starts being shipped to the US fully.
