              The 2500 series (3/4 ton) Suburban is almost perfect. The 8.1 liter engine is one of the smoothest I have owned (that includes a Wankel rotary and an SHO both of which are renowned for being smooth). Torque is delivered over a broad, flat curve. (It would be nice if they opened up the exhaust just a hair for a little more "tone").
  The Autoride suspension is a must, no more gathering the passengers on the outside of the truck on on-ramps, like a yacht racer, to prevent roll-over like in all the other SUV's (big or small). It handles like it has independent rear suspension, no wheel hop in turns at highway speeds, great cross-country hauler at speed and sure-footed when off-road.
  Chassis is rock solid, no creaking or flexing when pushed to the limit in rough terrain.
  Despite smaller exterior dimensions than the Excursion it has more usable space inside. Opt for the middle bench, with it you can seat 8 adults comfortably.
  Negatives:  
    -There is no excuse for a $46,000 (sticker) truck to have lap-belts in the center seating positions.
    -Poor speaker positioning means a 9 speaker system plays like a 3 speaker system. 
    -17" wheels would look more proportionate to the size of the vehicle.
    -Sunroof needs to be larger.
