            We were shopping for a truck when I was 5months pregnant, so whatever we decided on had to be able to accommodate a carseat comfortably 
and safely.  We purchased a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 with the xtra cab. 
The baby's carseat fit perfectly in the center of the backseat.  When I pull the front seat all the way forward, there is plenty of room for me to stand in the backseat area and strap the baby into the carseat.  
For a short pregnant women, it was rather difficult to climb into the front seat without a helping hand.  The seats are roomy and comfy. We've made many long roadtrips in this truck.  If it's a family vehicle you are seeking and your not a &quot;van person&quot;, and the utility vehicles are out of your budget than the Dodge Ram 1500 xtra cab is worth a look.  This is definitely a family vehicle.  There is plenty of room in the normal sized back seat to add 2 more children.  The front seat will hold 2 adults and one child comfortably.  <br><br>
