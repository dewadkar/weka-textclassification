            I have a '99 4-door Cavalier.  Nice size car.  I have found these cars are durable and trustworthy.  My first new car was a '92 Cavalier.  When I was deciding on buying a new one; I did want something different.  I looked at the Saturns because I had heard they were &quot;rust-proof&quot;.  Which is one thing the Cavalier is not.  I even test drove it, but it didn't feel right.  There was not enough room.  

I ended up going back to the Cavalier because I was still driving my '92 and it had 221,000 miles on it.  I ended up selling it to my sister who just loves it.  The trunk in the '99 takes a little getting use to.  The trunk lid is only about 1/2 the size of a normal one so that is the only space you have so literally set stuff in; the back seat folds down so if you need extra room; this is where your going to find it.  

I enjoyed the cupholders on the '92 model better.  The cupholder is now below the stereo and there is just a spot for the cup.  I haven't spilled anything yet, but I'm afraid I will.  The maintenance has been none, the oil change is all.  A month after I got it I went on a trip about 3,000 miles away and it was a wonderful ride.  <br><br>
