            We've had our Sony DSC-S50 for about 6 months and it has definitely been the best digital imaging purchase to date. We bought it because my husband was about to start a new job where he would be traveling a lot, and this was a way to send him a new picture of our daughter every day.

I would recommend this camera to anyone who spends a good portion of their income on film developing. I can only imagine how much money we would have saved if this had been around when our daughter was born. With this camera, not only can you take great digital pictures, but you can also record speech to go along with the picture or take short movies. Perfect for new parents when a camcorder is just too much. 

For the more serious photographer, you can program it much the same way you can with high end point and shoot cameras. We still carry our Pentax SLR with us on vacation for landscape shots or when we want a print, but the majority of the photos are made with the Sony. It is also extremely versatile in the camera setup. You can adjust the image quality, flash levels, exposure levels, time/data stamp and many others. Downloading is a snap with the USB connector.

One complaint with the camera is that it only comes with a 4MB Memory Stick. Go ahead and get the 32 or 64MB memory stick. You won't believe how fast you'll be taking pictures. Also, the LCD screen is hard to see in very bright light and the flash is a little weak in very dark situations. 

While it is a bit pricey, the features make it the camera of choice when buying your first digital camera.
