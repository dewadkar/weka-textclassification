            I took delivery on this truck almost two years ago now.  Although the new car feeling has worn off with 31,000 miles, the gas mileage has slowly improved to a daily driver  of 14.7mpg in the spring summer and fall and 12 in the winter with a daily commute of 24 miles round trip at 55MPH.  On a trip from NY to Florida I averaged 17mpg fully loaded to the roof of the cap.  This truck has the 4.8 engine with a fiberglass cap and 3.73 rear end.  
I find this truck to be very comfortable.  It is exceptionally quiet with a smooth ride.  It was hard to believe it was a 4x4.  We find this truck to be very functional with little conveniences such as 3 power outlets and 4 cup holders.  the back seat is comfortable for an adult man for about 2 hours.  The extended cab has a few inches added to it a few years ago.  This allows the rear seats to be tilted more than any other seat in an American truck, making the back seat almost pleasant.  The only negative situation I have had with this truck is what the dealer refers to as a cold start knock.  This doesn't seem to effect performance at this time and I am told that it won't.  Time will tell.
I drove a Ford and a Dodge and found the Chevy or GMC to be the nicest and I was trading a Dodge in after being dissatisfied so that really wasn't an option.  This truck was picked off the lot.  If I had a choice I would have opted for the 5.3 engine because the mileage was nearly identical.  I only mention the larger engine because I occasionally tow 3-4000 lbs and although the truck handles it, a little larger engine would have added the icing to the cake.
overall it has been a great truck that I plan on keeping 10 years.
