            I bought this vehicle used in October of 1996.  It only had 21000 miles on it and we paid around $11000 for it.  This car has been great, it has taken us on several trips to Utah, Oregon, Nevada and all over the Los Angeles area and the central California coast. (We live in the San Juaquin Valley)  It gets 340 miles to a tank of gas, no matter how fast or slow I drive.  I has guts to pass on the highway and zips around slower traffic like a car half it's size.  It now has around 116000 miles on it and we have had the starter rebuilt once and replaced the Altinator.  Other than that, it has been trouble free.  Highly recommended.<br><br>
