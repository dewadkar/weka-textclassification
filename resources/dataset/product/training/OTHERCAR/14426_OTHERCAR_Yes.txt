            My Dakota SLT is a 97 model that I leased @ the end of 97, I waited this long due to first year model jitters, I was pleased with the reviews that I had read about and heard about from friends so now I am passing this on to you as my friends did for me.  From the start I fell in love with the power to weight ratio of the 5.2L 318 automatic workhorse, I just couldn't keep my foot out of it (luckily no tickets yet!) I've had several muscle cars w/ smallblock v-8's and this by far was no slouch.  I bought this ride mainly to pull my 24' boat which it did as if it were not even there, the Original tires even gave a smooth ride with a load on them!  A friend of mine who owned a Ford Lightning was VERY impressed with the smaller Dakota package so much so that he went out and purchased a 98 model.  I have had few problems w/ the Dakota but the ones I've had were noticeable, I have and continue to have transmission slips while driving up hills (w/out the boat) where at a normal acceleration the transmission becomes disengaged and the engine races to redline. I must come off the accelerator immediately and then re-accelerate for it to engage with a loud clunk.  I have quite a bit of mechanical knowledge and service my own vehicles and toys but this one stumped me even after transmission fluid level was checked and finally serviced with new fluid and filter.  The dealer kept insisting that it was the level, but I know it was to get me to go away.  The other problem I had was with the starter and flywheel. With only 4,000 miles on the vehicle the flywheel broke a tooth and made for some horrendous noise when starting, this was quickly replaced under warranty and I've had no problems since.  Once at about 7,000 mi. while my wife was driving the truck in heavy fast traffic the EFI fuel flow sensor quit working and the truck stalled out in a very dangerous situation.  after having it towed it was fixed under warranty. Now with 30,000 mi. I have not experienced any mechanical problems for 23k mi.  I enjoy the comfort of this ride over long distances which is rare for trucks.  If you are looking for a truck in the mid-size range, no matter what engine size you get this Dakota is hard to beat.  I will buy this at the end of the Lease!<br><br>
