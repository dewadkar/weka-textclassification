            I drive a 1990 Honda Accord LX 4-door.  I have had this car for 4 years.  I keep up with maintenance (i.e. oil changes, service tune-ups, etc.)  If you're looking for quality and reliability, this is the car for you.  My car has not given me any problems and has never broken down on me.  

I love the fact that it's extremely reliable.  I have driven halfway across the country, from Texas to North Carolina, with this car and back. 

I am in college, and at the time of purchase, I was attending high school.  Another factor that urged me to buy this car was that it was affordable.  Being in high school at the time, I didn't have a great deal of money to spend on a car.  

I think anyone who is looking for a reliable, yet affordable car that looks great and drives smooth, then they should absolutely consider the Honda Accord.  And if you're into the more sporty look, there's the Honda Accord Coupe (2 door).  <br><br>
