                 We have a 1999 RAV4-L which has most of the usual options such as electric windows and locks, cruise, A/C, automatic, AWD, roof rack. It's a great little car, especially as a second family vehicle.  Fun to drive around town with decent gas mileage (low 20's mpg), & excellent fit/finish/reliability, plus my three kids all think it is sort of cool. The only drawbacks are that it is a little noisy, especially for sustained highway driving, plus seating in back is cramped, but neither of those are the reasons we bought it. It is a practical little wagon, especially with the rear seats either folded down or removed completely (which is easy to do, although it does require you to unbolt them with a socket wrench).  
     We had narrowed our choices down to the RAV4 and the Honda CRV and I think either would have been a good choice.  Both are excellent in terms of quality and reliability. Personally I thought the RAV4 was a little more fun to drive because of driver position and handling, and frankly we just like the local Toyota dealer better.
   I guess other drawbacks for some people would be that there are cheaper small SUVs out there (Hyundai, Ford, Suzuki/Chevrolet...). But we have had excellent experiences with other Toyota (Corolla) and Honda (Accord) vehicles in the past. Personally, I feel Toyota and Honda still have a quality edge over most competitors that is worth paying for, at least in my opinion.
