            Dodge Hemi. The words resonate with low rumble of untamed V-8, smell of high octane gas and squal of burning rubber. In a stroke of marketing brilliance, Daimler-Chrysler chose to resurrect the Muscle Car era American iconesque engine, Hemi, and seat it into its struggling line of trucks. Lo and behold, sales took off, and as I found out, Hemi Rams are flying off of dealer lots.

My search for cure to Hemi fever took me first to Burgin Dodge in Knoxville, TN. They had no short bed Hemi Ram 1500s in stock, but the friendly sales people, Ron and Doug, went beyond call and duty in trying to locate me one. Alas, I was not in a mood for a quad-cab, so off I went to Oak Ridge Chrysler, where I was presented with the meanest, baddest a monster of a pickup truck, a white Ram 1500 Hemi SLT with 20" wheels. I was hooked from the moment the Hemi roared alive, and only the tight confines of the dealership prevented me from burning rubber on the spot. This was a Truck with capital T! And when the most excellent folks at Oak Ridge Chrysler jotted down the magic numbers "$199 below invoice", I was soon on my way home in my Ford-eating-Chevy-chewing Snow White.

EXTERIOR: 8
I love the quasi-retro, big-rig styling of the Ram. Fit and finish is good although not perfect. The only major gripe I have is that doors have to be slammed shut.

INTERIOR: 9
The cab is surprisingly spacious for a regular cab, there's even a good sized storage bin behind the seats. The dashboard layout is very good for an American made vehicle. The power-adjustable cloth driver's seat is hard and provides almost no thigh or lateral support. The cab is also very quiet, I have to drive with the window open to really hear the Hemi rumble :)

POWERTRAIN: 9
The Hemi is more than a pretty badge on the front fender. Although based on ancient push-rod valve technology, the 5.7 liter Hemi is actually lighter and more fuel efficient than the 5.9 V-8 offered by Dodge.

HANDLING AND RIDE: 7
It's a pick up truck, so don't expect passenger car ride. For a short bed truck, Snow White's handling is fairly consistent, but definetely unrefined. The steering gives little to no feedback, and every small bump makes the body judder and sway. Four wheel ABS disk brakes do the job more than adequately.
