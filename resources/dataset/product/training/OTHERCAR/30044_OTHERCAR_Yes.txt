            I just purchased a used DC-280 from Ebay for $355 and got lots of extras.

I checked out new digital cams in the stores and found that I would have to pay about 600 bucks to get a good working setup. Now way I was going to pay that much. So I check Ebay and found this cam, bid on it and won. (Got in a bidding war with another guy and paid a little more then I had originally planned but still think I got a pretty good deal.)

I got the cam, a nice case for it, 20mg and 8mg flash cards, a PCMCIA card reader, USB connector, AC power adapter, 4AA batteries, 4 Rechareables and Recharger, all the original software and the previous owner has already upgraded the firmware to v1.1. 

I purchase separetely another 4 rechareables to use as spares.

One complaint I hear about this cam (and most digitals) is that they suck up batteries ... so far I haven't had any probables with this. I have used the same set of recharables all day long and never even got a low battery warning. I use the LCD sparingly and I download using the AC adapter and USB connector in order to save power. I can get about 100 shots in the lowest quality(Good)/largest pixel count format(high) with my two flash cards. I delete some of the bad shots on the fly as I go with a quick view of the shot in the LCD.

The pics come out great ... you can take a look at some pics I took recently down in S. Utah with this cam:

On thing I don't like with this cam is the optical zoom. It is between a wider angle and up to a normal 55mm type angle. There is no telephoto on this (except in digital telephoto which sucks). Another problem is that my greasy nose smugges the LCD when I look through the view finder ... this is a minor issue.

One problem people mention with this cam is that it is not good at taking night shots.  I have found that I can fix those shots with a photo editing software (I use irfanview which is great at doing slide shows too). I just adjust the gama and contrast and I can bring out the stuff that is in the darkened areas of the photo.

One problem I have anticipated is going on a long trip and using up my card space. Luckly we have a laptop and so we will bring it and download a days worth of pics to it using the PCMCIA flash card reader and check them out. I hate the idea of lugging the laptop on the trip but I guess that is what needs to be done.

We are planning to go all digital and to eventually scan all our old physical photo albums and save some space on our shelves.

If you want to get into Digital photography, I highly recommend getting a used one on Ebay. The DC-3400 is really practically the same cam but with less optional stuff that comes with it ... so I have heard ... check this out on your own to be sure.

There is a egroup on yahoo where you can ask questions and get info on using this cam.
