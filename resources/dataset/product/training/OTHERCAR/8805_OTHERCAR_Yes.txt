  The new Accord is quite a car.  The ergonomics are far above anything in its price range, it's finally got a potent V6, and sales reflect just how great a car it is.
    
    The 3.0 liter, DOHC VTEC V-6 revs freely and smoothly, surpassing the refined efforts of Toyota's Camry.  With 200hp on tap, it gets you where you want to go without complaining.  It has the guts to get you to the grocery store and accelerate to speed in most situations.  What is unusual for an Accord, although welcomed, is the torque that comes with the extra displacement.

    Weighing in at slightly over 3000 lbs, the Accord has a comfortable ride, and blessed with supportive seats and good ergonomics, makes for a good cruiser for long drives.  The independent rear suspension is a bit soft for my tastes, but exhibits linear and predictable understeer.  

   The only downfall of the Accord is its styler.  Or rather, the lack thereof.  It's a faceless car, but benign enough to satisfy the masses I suppose.  Despite its lack of personality, the overall quality surpasses anything in its price range and the added power of the V6 adds incentive.

Verdict?  A faceless car, but everything else is right on par.<br><br>
