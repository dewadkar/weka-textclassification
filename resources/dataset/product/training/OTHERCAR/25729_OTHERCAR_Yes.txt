            Thoughts on the New Beetle: 

Think DIESEL! If you're considering buying a NB with a manual transmission, you should test drive the TDI diesel. (I understand that you can get a TDI diesel with the automatic transmission, but where's the fun in that???)

The TDI is nothing like the automotive diesels of old. It's not noisy, there's no black smoke, and it starts instantly (no warm-up time). It has very decent acceleration (unlike the standard gas engine), and excellent torque. No problem going up hills! And my NB is getting over 45 MPG (EPA rated at 48). With its 14 gallon tank, this car has quite a cruising range.

The interior and exterior styling of this car are beautiful. The convenience and dash lighting are extremely well thought out, and look stunning at night.

Handling is very good, although there is some body roll (which could probably be corrected by stiffening the suspension). This car is EXTREMELY fun to drive; very responsive, and you feel connected to the road. The 6-speaker stereo sounds very good (decent, but not killer bass). The optional CD changer (around $400) makes the stereo sound even better. The rear seat folds down to make the NB a quasi-hatchback when you need to haul lots of groceries/whatever.

The not-so-good factors: 

1. The 3 front cupholders are pretty useless - not enough clearance to hold large drinks.
2. The front headlights seem to lose their seal to the bodywork - water seeps inside. (This has happened twice to my left headlight.)
3. Don't plan on hauling adults in the back seat.
4. Folding down the rear seat for hatchback mode is awkward. Getting odd-shaped packages in/out of the trunk can be difficult .<br><br>
