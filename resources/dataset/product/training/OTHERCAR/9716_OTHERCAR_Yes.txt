            I purchased a 1993.5 Infiniti G20 in Febuary of 2002 and in the 10 months I have owned this wonderful car, I have done nothing but change the oil and drive this unique automobile.  I get a lot of compliments because of the condition and the rareness of this car.  I do not see many on the roads but that does not mean that this car is not amazing.  Consumer Reports still calls this the most dependable car on the road...
<p>
My G20 regularly gets between 23-30mpg depending on how hard I drive it.  The 4 cylinder engine likes to be in the 4-5k range for power which can be a little noisy, but nothing to really complain about.  The engine is very nimble and cruises nicely at 65.  I bought a 5-speed manual and I would recommend getting a manual because it is the easiest shifting I have had in a car I have owned (8 cars) and you will get the most out of the engine.  The handling is very tight and stiff, which can be a problem for the "soft ride" crowd...The G20 is perfect for the young at heart and for youthful lower backs.  That does not mean the seats aren't comfortable, but rather the tight suspension is tuned for tight turns and many bumps are felt.....
<p>
I was looking at many cars when I purchased my G20 and for the price I paid ($5000) you dont get a much better deal...Infiniti (Nissan) truly built a solid and high quality car, I never hear any squeks or rattles.  Even small things like the carpet and headliner are in great shape after 10 years of wear and tear...I have cloth seats and the cloth is very thick and even the drivers seat has NO wear...
<p>
The instrumentation layout is done very nicely and everything is right at your finger tips...The head rooms is great (I am 6'1) and the rear seat hold two average size adults quite well...The rear trunk space is adequate and can hold a weeks worth of vacation bags etc....The 6 speaker stereo sounds great and all the speakers are amplified for optimum sound...I replaced the very small 14inch stock rims with a set of 2001 G20 15inch rims and it makes the biggest difference...The car looks amazing with upgraded wheels...  go to my webpage and click on cars to see pics of my car with the 2001 wheel upgrade..   <b>http://www.geocities.com/calapuke</b>

Now for the "bad stuff"<p>
-the car has a very bland style and is lacking in the style and power department to the BMW...
-the 14inch stock wheels they give you are quite a joke, I would recommend replacing them as soon as possible (2001 G20 wheels are really sweet and are a perfect fit)
-the engine is only 140hp which is by no means competitive with any other cars in its class....
-parts from Infiniti are rather expensive, but the good thing is that the parts are built to last
- NO CUPHOLDERS  ... there are some din size cupholders you could find on ebay to help you out...
- I really HATE the beige cloth seating color...The seats are comfortable and the cloth is nice, but it seems that a lot of the G20's came with this beige color that is kinda ugly...

<p> I recommend this car to college students and the young smart consumer that wants to drive a very luxurious car without breaking the bank...

www.g20.net is a great place to start once you own a G20...
