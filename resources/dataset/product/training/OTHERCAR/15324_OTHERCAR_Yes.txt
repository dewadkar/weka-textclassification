             I originally bought this camera as a replacement for another Sony Mavica (the FD-81) when mine was stolen. I operate in a corporate computer network that is extremely rigid with it's hardware and software permissions. That said, I needed a camera that needed no direct interface (IE, USB cable,serial port, parallel ports), and it also had to use existing software available on my system. The Sony Mavica series has fit my needs perfectly. It &quot;records&quot; to a 3.5 inch floppy disk, and the user has the option to adjust the amount of pictures that you can get on the disk by increasing or decreasing the size of the pictures and the clarity.The default picture viewer that is used in my computer was MS Internet Explorer, a very common application. In addition the MVC-FD83 can also take MPEG movies in 5, 10 or 15 second increments. It also comes with voice stamp so you can audibly hear your description of the image you were taking. As the infomercials always say: But Wait! That's not all! This camera also comes with a TV out cable to connect the camera directly to your vcr or tv, that way, you don't even need a computer to view the images in full size. The design of the camera is very rugged. I have used it under some intense field conditions, (extreme cold, damp environs, and hopping on and off aircraft). The form of the camera doesn't allow for a lot of &quot;snap off&quot; potential. All in all a dependable camera that as I said before, is almost idiot proof to use in all it's features.<br><br>
