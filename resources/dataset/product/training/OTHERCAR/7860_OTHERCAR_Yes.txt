            I have owned my black 2001 330ci for 18 months, and still love it.  At $41,000 it was expensive, but resale values appear to be holding up, unlike some other prestige cars like the Audi A4.  I am impressed with the gas mileage - around 27 in combined city/highway driving.  Even driving very aggressively I can get 22 mpg.  The premium package and heated seats are definitely worth the extra money if you intend to keep and drive the car for long.  The leather sport seats are gorgeous, very comfortable, and very adjustable.  The cabin feels solid and rich.  The heated seats are luscious in cold weather.  The driving position is perfect, the controls feel perfect, visibility is great, and the car feels roomy and bigger than it is.  That is, until you try to stick an infant seat in the back.  Suddenly it feels very cramped.  And when the road is snowy/icy, this car is scary with its performance tires.  The traction control helps, but if the road is very slippery, the car won't move because the traction control is constantly intervening.  Overall, I love it, but if it had to be my only car I would have gotten an AWD 330xi instead of the 2wd coupe.  The xi handles almost as well, is nearly as fast, but has the advantage of 4 doors and AWD.
