            I have had this camera for 3 years and it is is now long since discontinued by Kodak and is no longer available new. It is, however, still available used aplenty on eBay and elsewhere and, while it has been superseded by other more current cameras, there is still something to be said about the DC215. It is a very basic 1 megapixel camera that takes quite usable pictures (no larger than 4 X 6). I have found it to be very durable and easy to use. The photos are not the best in terms of resolution or focus (if the subject is far away) but the color is great. The DC215 does have some features that were unusual when it first came out and are still rare on inexpensive cameras. For instance, it has an LCD display panel on the top that gives basic information and a 2X zoom lens made out of real optical glass. As well, its body is made of metal! It has rubber coated handgrips and footpeg below the front of the lens. It is definitely not cheaply made. However, it does have limitations. The computer connection is serial port (not USB) and so it is slow in uploading pictures. You'll probably want a compact flash card reader if you'll be taking lots of photos. As well, the lens is fixed focus and that's why photos farther than 12 feet, or so, are not as sharp as they can be. Another possible irritation is that it takes about 11 seconds between photos. You take one photo and then have to wait 11 seconds before you can take another. If you don't want to spend big money on a digital camera and you want to just take snaps buy a decent used model and you'll be happy.
