            The lure of a hard top convertible, coupled with MBZ's reputation for quality was simply to much to resist. With one test drive I was hooked.

Now that I have had the car for almost a year, my enthusiasm for a hard top convertible has not diminished, however, my belief in MBZ quality has.  The promise of a sedan quite ride in the SLK is simply not a fact. After four visits to the dealer, the roof still squeaks when in the up position. The likelihood is that this is an inherent problem and will not be repaired. If this was an occasional problem I could more easily live with it, as compared to the reality of consistent noise from the top.

Otherwise, on those warm days and evenings, the retraction of the roof couldn't be easier with one button operation.  Sure trunk space is very limited, especially with the top down but I can live with that.

Seat adjustments are limited and I would not suggest long trips in the SLK, although handling and acceleration are exceptional.

If you want to fell like a teenager again, give the SLK a serious look, but temper your expectations for a quite ride and seat comfort.
