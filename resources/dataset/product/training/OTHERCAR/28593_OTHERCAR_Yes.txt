            My parents surprised me with a new Jeep for a college graduation present... I was skeptical at first, because it won't be long before I get a professional job, and I wasn't sure that I'd be wanting to climb in and out of a truck in my work clothes.  After driving it just once with the top down, my concerns disappeared.  I LOVE my Jeep.  It has running boards so its not so hard to get in and out of anyway.

Driving the Jeep is so much fun, on or off the road.  I've put 3500 miles on it in just 5 weeks.  You wouldn't believe the feeling of freedom that comes with driving a vehicle that can go ANYWHERE!  It IS a bumpy ride, but that's 1/2 the fun of it.

Some options I would highly recommend are air conditioning, cloth seats (don't worry, they dry fast if they get wet), and the fold and tumble backseat.  I have the 4 cylinder engine, and I haven't been impressed with its highway performance.  I haven't driven the Wrangler Sport, but if I were looking to buy a Jeep myself, I would certainly consider the bigger engine.  My Wrangler does have a manual transmission, something that I had never driven before.  I was able to pick it up in just a few hours.  I think it would be a shame to burden such a fun car with an automatic transmission.

Also, DEFINITELY buy, don't lease.  There are so many neat accessories and things to buy for your Jeep, and you don't want to be tied down by a lease agreement.

All in all, I wouldn't trade my Jeep for the world, and I can see myself being a Wrangler owner for life :)<br><br>
