I own a 1994 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 with all the options, and I must say it is the most enjoyable driving experience I have ever encountered. I bought this vehicle for it's outstanding performance, and very sleek looks. I was under the impression I would be paying through the nose for repairs all the time, but I was delightfully mistaken when after 2 years of owning the vehicle (I bought it used) I have had absolutely no problems at all! Routine maintenance keeps it in shape, and maybe it's just me but it always feels faster after I give it a good wash.

The first time I learned of this cars existence, was in a magazine ad. It went something like this:
There is a black VR-4 with the driver looking up through the sun roof at an inverted Tomcat flying low, with the pilot looking down at the driver. The caption: &quot;Sunroof: So you can look your competition in the eye.&quot;
They were not kidding. When I get in I feel as if I need to check with Houston for clearance. The driving instruments and controls are very cockpit-like in fact, everything is adjustable and within reach. Mitsubishi did not mess around when making their flagship, there is not a single part on the car that is &quot;flimsy&quot;, or not constructed well. My complaints? Reverse is hard to engage at times, but sometimes I consider that a safe guard when I'm speed shifting. The car is also pretty heavy, but again it is my preference to have a big, &quot;outta my way&quot; type of car. What would I change? My income so I can get the Spyder (convertible) model.

All I have to say is:
0-60mph = 5.1 seconds
