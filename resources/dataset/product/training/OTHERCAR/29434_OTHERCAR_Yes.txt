            Hi All...

My husband just purchased the Q45 and we both love it.  


This car has such a wonderfully smooth ride....it's like riding on a
cloud.....you don't feel ONE bump....and it hugs the road like a sports
car....

The interior is very well appointed.....nice woods and leather....and
everything is pretty convenient and easy to use except the window controls.

We've found that on the drivers side the controls for the windows seem
to be moved back a little further than normal and we almost always end
up putting down the back windows instead of the front just because of
the positioning of the control buttons....

We had a Jaguar XJ as a loaner car a few weeks ago and couldn't wait to
get back to our Q45....the ride was just much smoother in the Q than
the Jag....

The price is reasonable and the lines of the car are very nice....all in
all we recommend this car...
