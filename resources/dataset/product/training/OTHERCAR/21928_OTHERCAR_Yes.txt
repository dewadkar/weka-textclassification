            I bought a '99 528i last year (99).  I really really love it.  I think the BMW sports package (an additional $2K) is a MUST.  You get 17' spoke-rims, ~slightly~ lowered body, anti-roll bar under the hood, sports steering wheel, and the sports interior just looks incredible.  It may because of the color combo -&gt; metallic blue exterior, gray leather interior with sports package -&gt; wonderfully awesome.
I bought this car because for one, it looks awesome.  Some said the car looks sexy.  Well, I'm not sure I would say that, but it is.  Also, it can perform far better than your average middle-class car.  The 193hp v6 engine is very quick and nimble.  Of course, the 540i 280hp v8 counterpart is Car and Driver's luxury performance sedan of 1999, so if you want serious sedan performance get the 540i.  I've got enough speeding tickets already, so the 528i suits me just fine.  And like I said, it'll blow away any middle-class sedan in the 30-40k range.  Mercedes, Lexus, nice try, forget it.  The BMW brand is in a class all it own.  
I also bought it because it can seat up to 5 people and much more roomy than a 3-series. (plus, all the young post-college punks have 3-series).  So, with the sports package, you still feel young, but with a more professional, sophisticated edge.  
The ride is extremely quiet and smooth.  I love to drive it.  Even in heavy traffic I don't mind.  I just use the steering wheel buttons to navigate the cd changer, crank up the volume and I'm golden.
It's a pure pleasure to own one and I know this review doesn't own up to all the great points about the car.<br><br>
