            I wanted to find a camera that I could load into my computer, print and send to friends without having to scan each one. Friends told me about digital cameras but I wasn't much of a camera fan. I had some people show me different kinds of digital cameras and I went on the internet and viewed a lot of pictures taken with digital cameras. I also wanted something that was fairly easy to load into my computer because I am what is know as a computer dummy. If you can find better words for it than that, so be it. I really liked the idea of putting my pictures onto floppy discs because it was a simple procedure and very cheap. I also needed to find one in my price range, which was under $500.00. Not really hard to find but one with quality. Sony has always been a good brand name to me so that is what I looked at and finally I purchased the Mavica FD83.I was flabergasted at the ease with which I could take pictures, with or without the flash, close ups or far away and so quick. I started trying different things with my new found friend. I never was much of a person for taking photos and usually left that chore up to my wife. Well no more. I started talking pictures of anything and everything. I took pictures of spiders capturing ants and of flying aircraft and of people. I still can't get over how good the pictures are when taken with the zoom lens or the wide angle. They are absolutely great. We went to visit my Grandchildren last month and spent 28 days with them and I filled 7 floppy discs with photos, some holding 33 and some holding 40 pictures. I never realized how many pictures that I could get on a floppy disc. So I have put this camera through a lot. I have sat in the stands at a football game and took close up pictures of my Gransons playing in the line on the field. It is a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone. Try it, you will like it.<br><br>
