            My wife and I purchased a 98 Chevy Venture in Dec '98. This is an outstanding vehicle. Easy to handle and easy to maintain. 
I agree that it is an excellent vehicle to commute. This vehicle was purchased as we have always been a fan of the GM product line in Chevys and have owned two Cavlier Wagons prior to this. The Wagon was discontinued so we sought a new &quot;wagon&quot; to replace it. This van drives like a car but gives the ease of entering and exiting like a truck or full size van. You are sitting higher on the road so it is easier and fun to drive.

The first trip we took with this vehicle was for Christmas to Florida. I live in Cleveland, OH. We drove with two other family members straight down to Orlando. The trip was for the most part relaxing but the back seats are somewhat uncomfortable for long trips. I have the two bench model. I have no problems with removing and installing the seats though. I must have the new mechanism for removal. I would recommend that if you have the older type then get it in and have them replaced. The seats just have pull tabs that cause the seat to fold forward then unlatch and move to an upright position. From here it is just a matter of lifting a bar and the seat comes out into your hands. Very simple and the seats are relativly light so are easily handled after removal.

The model I have has the power sliding side passenger door and a sliding door on the driver's side. The power sliding door is an excellent feature and highly recommended for less fumbling when shopping with packages. Just hit the button on the remote key chain and the door is open when you get there. The driver's sliding door is a very nice touch as well so when shopping or commuting by yourself you can open the door and put briefcase, shopping bags in the back seat. I think that this will also be a power door in future models. 

We also opted for the dual climate and radio/cassette/cd controller in the back. This is nice on trips so the people in the back can listen to their own music while the driver passenger has their own type. I would recommend this feature.

The cargo space in this van (extended version) is quite extensive with the back seats removed. I believe a full 4x8 sheet of plywood will fit in it. My wife and I do some lawn ornaments so have tried this. This also can be done by just folding the seats down and not even fully removing them.

All in all I would say that this van is very much worth the money. I personally do not feel that there are any &quot;cons&quot; about it and we have had it for almost a year now.<br><br>
