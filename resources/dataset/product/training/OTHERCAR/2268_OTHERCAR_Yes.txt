            I never thought I'd buy a vehicle with the word Isuzu on the front.  But when my 1988 VW Jetta died, I wanted a new car that was practical, affordable and looked good.  As a 32-year old bachelor, I was tired of driving an uglymobile deathtrap with no airbags.
After making an arduous geographical and internet search, I came across a super lease deal for the 1999 Isuzu Rodeo - yes, the Rodeo.  I decided that I would buy if I could find a white one with black trim.  After visiting three far-apart dealers, I called and found a black one an hour away.  I settled, but by the time I got there, it was gone.  I reluctantly put my money down on the last one left, a forest green one, without ever having considered the Amigo because I thought it was not large enough to carry my drum set.
My decision never did sit well.  When I returned to the dealer the next day to finish the paperwork, he was busy, so I wandered the showroom.  A great song was playing on the radio and I almost literally bumped into a white hardtop Amigo with black trim.  It looked great.  I clambered around inside.  It was just the model I would have wanted, too - white, 5-speed manual, 2WD (I can't afford 4WD) and 4 cylinder engine (I am an environmentalist.)
I went back to the salesperson and said &quot;I want to drive one of those while I'm waiting.&quot;  They obliged, and when I hit the highway, I knew I had my truck.  I felt like I was driving a Tigger (bouncy bouncy funfunfunfunfun), and the 4 cylinder moved the truck fairly well.  Upon my return, we tore up the paperwork and drew up my Amigo lease, which was actually $30 MORE a month than the Rodeo.
I was very happy for the first month.  I have only seen one other white 99 Amigo on the road in the nine months I've owned her, and I HATE being one of the crowd with my car.  In September, the truck showed its worth by getting me home during Hurricane Floyd when the creek was a foot deep on my road.  Had I driven the VW, I would have needed oars.
As time goes on, however, I realize that I don't enjoy driving it too much.  The roads in my area of Pennsylvania are twisty and narrow and I can't throw the truck into turns like I could the VW.  It's so springy I tense up my back, as if that will stop it from rolling.  The pickup isn't that great.  Furthermore, the defogger can't seem to clear up the windshield even at full power, the spare tire seriously blocks visibility, and I can't seem to feel the brakes right.  Not only is it really a squeeze to fit my drums, but the back window doesn't open, so you're not going to carry any poles or boards in this truck.
On the plus side, it still looks wicked, gets decent mileage for an SUV and has a great turning radius.  The engine runs very smoothly and quietly.  The reading lights behind the rear-view mirror are cool and easy to use.  And I've never seen another small SUV with TWO sunroofs!  Every time I see someone in a Honda CRV, Jeep Wrangler or particularly a Chevy Tracker, I can't help thinking that I got the more attractive vehicle by far.  I don't know how they stack up otherwise.
I still can't decide whether to buy this sucker at the end of the lease so I guess my recommendation isn't too strong.  But gosh darn it if you're poor and want to look cool and different, try an Amigo.
