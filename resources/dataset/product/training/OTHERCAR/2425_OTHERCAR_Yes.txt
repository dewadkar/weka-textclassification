            This vehicle is perfect for me, as it is my first sport utility vehicle purchase.  It is kind of small and has plenty of power, which should be a plus for anyone going from a sports car to a Cherokee.  This Jeep has done superb off-road.  It has been on a Jeep Jamboree in Kentucky and survived a trail rated &quot;8&quot; with no problems.  This Jeep Cherokee Country was the nicest Cherokee you could buy in 1995.  It came with remote keyless entry, woodgrain trim on the dash and doors, two-tone paint, and power everything.  There are only a couple of gripes I have about my Cherokee,  One is the placement of the factory cupholder attachment.  Front seat passengers always knock it off.  Second is the loudness inside the vehicle at 60 mph and above.  Otherwise, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned!<br><br>
