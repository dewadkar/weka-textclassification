            This is a great truck, I own a 1997 Dodge Ram  two wheel drive.  I have never had one problem with it, (I hope it stays that way).  I purchased this truck used in 1998, it had approx. 15,ooo miles on it.  It is a long bed with a v-8.  The roominess of this truck is great, lots of leg room, and head room. I am five eleven and believe me this is a roomie truck.  It drives like a nice car, not like  what you would expect from a big old pick up truck. We pull a 22 foot searay boat behind this truck all the time with no problems at all. Mine has power everything, and is a breeze to park, turn, and back up.  It has lots of power to get up and go also, no worries about pulling out into traffic.  The one downside I think is it's awful cup holders, they stuck them right up almost on the dash board they are in the way when you drive and drinks fall over all the time, very bad design.  I understand the 98 and up models have a new cup holder design, thank heavens. Gas mileage is not great, but for a big powerful truck I think that to be expected. Overall this is a great truck and I will purchase another Dodge truck again in the future. <br><br>
