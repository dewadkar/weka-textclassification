            I had a GMC suburban that was a problem from the first week I had it. I bought it brand new, and after one week I found myself skidding almost every time I hit the brakes. This was not in the rain either, it was dry and hot outside.

When I took the car into the dealer, they told me I needed to learn how to drive with the new anti-lock brakes. They even took me for a ride and showed me how to drive it properly.

Well, no matter what I did, the brakes skid, and I never knew when it would happen. Then one day we were on our way home from vacation, and on the freeway when we rear ended a car.  We were more than 2 car lenghts away from the car in front of us, but the traffic slowed, did not even stop, when we hit the car HARD! 

I knew immediately that it was the anti-lock brake problem. But of course it was blamed on us, and our insurance company had to pay the women we hit. This happened over four years ago.

Then one nice day a few months ago, I read in the newspaper that the GMC Suburbans were being recalled for faulty breaks. THE EXACT PROBLEM WE HAD!! Now for the last several months I have been trying to track down my insurance company records to see how much was paid to the women we hit, how much our insurance went up, and how much our repair bills were to our car.  I intend to contact GM to compensate us for all the damage since obviously the accident was not our fault, but the fault of the brakes!<br><br>
