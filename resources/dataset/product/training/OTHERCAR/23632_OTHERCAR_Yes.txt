            We bought a Jeep Cherokee Country 4 WD in May of last year.  I had been wanting one of these for quite some time.  I like the sporty look.  I had to convince my husband that this was what we wanted though.  He wanted a Chevy Blazer. When we found this I knew it would be as close to perfect as I could get, navy blue with the big tires and all the extras.  I finally got hubby to drive it and we both knew that this was &quot;the one&quot;.
This jeep cherokee handles very well and is very comfortable, it is a four door.  When you fold that back seat down there is plenty of cargo space for large trips to Sams (!) and weekend excursions.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who lives in snowy climates and people who want something &quot;a little bigger&quot; but not overwhelming.  <br><br>
