            This camera is amazing. Especially because it's only a 2.1 mega-pixel camera. But with the 10x zoom, you realize that being able to use all of the 2.1 Mega pixels by correct zoom framing still leads to great pictures. The C-2100 has lots of features including full manual focus, shutter or aperture priority, movies, and too many mores.

The camera is hard on batteries, but thankfully it comes with a charger and 4 AA NiMh rechargeable cells. I bought a second set of batteries at Kmart for less than $10.

Exposures and focus are mostly just right. Where on other cameras, I would need to adjust brightness, contrast and gamma after uploading, Pictures from the C2100 need almost no work.

As I said, the image quality is amazing. Even using the standard HQ jpeg compression 8x10 prints look outstanding. I've probably shot several hundred pictures so far, and haven't even tried the highest quality TIFF setting -- the default HQ setting is that good.

Why not get a 3 or 4 MegaPixel camera? First, I couldn't find one with a 10X zoom. And second, as I now realize, the extra pixels just make the picture files bigger. Unless you're planning on shooting 11x14 or posters, or unless you need to blow up a small section of a print, 2.1 MegaPixels is a great compromise.  And once again, the big zoom (optically image stabilized) makes it less likely that you will need to blow up a small section of the picture.

As you can tell, I am delighted with the camera.
