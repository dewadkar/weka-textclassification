            I read some of the other opinions before I wrote this. I will make it brief because so many things I could say would only echo the sentiments of others. It is one sweet little van at a sweet little price.

I hesitate to be critical because I think we get what we pay for. Today's vehicle selling for $60,000 should sport perfection, but this little gem certainly gives you your money's worth. 

The interior is roomier than the old Caravans, more comfortable and more attractive. It is wonderful to be able to adjust the temperature in each area of the van, meaning a person who likes it very cool can sit beside someone who likes it hot and both are happy! (That probably covers half the couples in America.)

The drive is average, the van is no powerhouse. Still, it pulled the hills fully loaded on our recent trip to West Virginia. If it didn't complain, why should I? 

All the systems seem better than in the van that preceded it- better stereo, better brakes, quieter ride. I did not like the fact that the rear windows do not open. As comfortable as the climate system is, it does not help you toss a piece of gum or get rid of a bad smell!

All in all, I am happy. I think a person should learn to view a vehicle and a spouse in the same light- if it is the best you can do, learn to appreciate it. Overlook the little things, try to play up what is good. It is a major part of your life and you have to live with it for quite awhile, so be happy!       <br><br>
