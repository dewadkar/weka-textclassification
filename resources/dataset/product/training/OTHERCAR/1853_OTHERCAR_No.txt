            When my company went bankrupt and I had to make major changes in my life the first thing to go was my pride and joy, my 1991 IROC Z28 Camaro. I needed a more economical car. My father (bless his heart) was helping me so his suggestion of a Grand Am had to at least be considered. I was fooled by the looks into thinking this was a small sporty car.  Boy was I wrong. This car has trouble getting out of it's own way. I have never prayed so much on the LA freeways in my life. If I have to move out of someone's way in a hurry I'm in trouble. There is next to no pick up. Once you reach 65 car runs ok just don't try to pass anyone. The seats are somewhat comfortable and there is more leg room than first meets the eye. The wheels have made a scraping noise on turns since car was new (1997).  Dealer says nothing wrong. The air conditioner sounds like it's coming through the dashboard. Dealer says my imagination. Tapes are hard to eject from cassette player. Dealer says must be cheap tapes. The car has more rattles than a baby. Dealer says turn up the stereo.  And what's with this 16 valve emblem plastered on the side of the car? Is that supposed to mean something?  At least I get good gas mileage. 25mpg around town. Just don't let the gas guage get below 1/4 tank.<br><br>
