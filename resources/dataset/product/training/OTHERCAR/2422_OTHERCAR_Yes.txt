            I have had my Cherokee Sport since new in 1995.  No problems with it at all, and have only had to replace the exhaust system.  Still haven't had my first tune up and it runs very well.  I find the command track transmission to be excellent as you can change back and forth from 2 to 4 wheel drive while driving.  Gas mileage while in 4wd is horrible, you can almost watch the gas needle move.  Although it is quite comfortable to drive, unlike some other Sport Utility Vehicles the Jeep is still very much like a truck (Pickup) than anything close to driving a luxury car.  The 4 door model is nice, although the back doors are small, and it is difficult for an adult to climb in comfortably.  The 4.0litre engine offers good pickup when you need to accelerate.  The standard stereo system is more than adequate and sounds fine.  The A/C system has been much more dependable than other vehicles I've purchased and I've only had to recharge it once in 8 years.
