            We bought our first Cavalier in 1986 and it was a good one but we thought we wanted a bigger car so then we bought a Celebrity, bad decision so we then bought another Cavalier in 1991 it was used at the time but only had 36,000 miles on it so we weren't afraid of it the first one one had over 100,000 miles when we traded it in. That car is still going strong and one of the most dependable cars around. 
It has 180,000 miles on it now and once we replaced the head gasket because one of our daughters was driving it and the thermostat went out and it overheated. Anyway I loved that car when I got it, I drove it back and forth to my job for 3 years then our youngest daughter at the time drove it to college for 2 years, now our very youngest daughter is still driving it mostly as her Neon keeps breaking down. 
Chevrolet used to build a tough little car the Chevette and then they stopped making them but thank goodness they replaced it with the Cavalier. One of the best toughest little cars you can buy. We kept the Cavalier for a backup car and we are glad we did as it still gets driven more than some cars. 
I am now driving a Corsica and I like it real well but for the next car, I'm going to look real hard at the Cavalier again. Another real good thing about this car is that they are fairly easy to work on and my husband is able to do almost all the maintance on it. It's really not a family car but for someone driving to work or even a teenager I highly recommend this car. They get very good gas mileage too.<br><br>
