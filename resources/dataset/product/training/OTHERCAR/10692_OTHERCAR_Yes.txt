            Recently my family purchased a brand new GMC Envoy.  The vehicle was bought after searching for the SUV that best suited our families' needs.  We test drove every model made by GMC, Chevrolet, Dodge, Jeep, Oldsmobile, and Ford.  Each time after we would find ourselves comparing the model we had driven to the Envoy.

This car has been very dependable in the time we have had it, and only taken several trips to the shop for tune-ups and monthly keep-ups.  The comfort this vehicle provides is wonderful and deeply recommended for long car trips.  There is room for the whole family to fit in.  Another wonderful thing about the Envoy is that no matter how tall a person is they are able to find plenty of leg room, not only in the front seat but also in the back seat as well.

The Envoy provides a smooth ride to all passengers and even allows room for people to move around.  The Envoy would be a wise purchase for people seeking a safe feeling in a car.  Not only is the ride safe in good weather but also in rainy and slippery weather also.  The safety this car provides is enough to make on feel very secure on long trips.

If you are looking for a dependable car that has room for everyone's needs the Envoy is definitely the SUV for you to purchase.  Check it out at any of you GMC dealers.<br><br>
