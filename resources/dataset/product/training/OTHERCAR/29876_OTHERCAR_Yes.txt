             See the pictures the instant you take them!! If you like the picture, keep it. If your subject has his/her eyes close, NO PROBLEM!!, delete it!! Easy as 1,2,3!!

 Upload is easy too! Great for laptops using the USB or PC Card!!

 I had only had a real cheap digital camera before this one, so I am really still learning everything the camera can do for me!!
  
 Compact Flash cards are expensive and you DO need several different ones. At least I do, since I don't seem to have the time to upload the pictures in the camera before I want to take another picture!! And of course I always fill the card up!!
 
 The camera will hold approx. 30-50 pictures at a time, depending on the flash card and the quality of picture you take. (You have an option for the quality)

 Little bit of &quot;Lag&quot; time from the time you click the button and when the camera actually snaps the picture. Great for still pictures!! I printed my Christmas cards from the computer using pictures I uploaded from this camera!! Turned out great!!
