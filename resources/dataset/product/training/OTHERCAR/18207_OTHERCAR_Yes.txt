            When I saw a demo of the Kodak EasyShare 6340 Digital camera and 6000 printer dock, I was reminded of a strange Bowie flick from the 70's, "The Man Who Fell To Earth."  Bowie plays an alien who introduces "miracle" products to the world, including a "Kodak" camera that produces instant process-quality prints. 

20 years later, that sci-fi concept has become a reality with the Kodak Easyshare system. When I saw the demo equipment at Circuit City, I casually took a photo of myself, loaded the camera in the dock, and pressed the print button.  

I wasn't expecting much, perhaps a decent quality inkjet photo. And I've been at this for years, and have never been truly impressed with inkjet photos.  They take too long to print, and use too much ink.  As I was watching the printer work, a salesman named Malik asked me if I needed help.  I declined, but then he couldn't contain his enthusiasm, so he boiled over in praise for this camera.  He kept using the word "awesome."  Then, when I saw the photo, I "got it" too!

Simply put, this is a fabulous product. I have been around PCs for 20 years, and have spent thousands on PCs, products, printers, scanners, cameras and software.  I have not been this impressed with a product since the introduction of the first affordable HP inkjet printer (Deskjet 500) in 1990.

The camera is so intuitive--menus are clear, and there is no overkill of features. Photos are excellent.

But the real story is the printer, and the photo process.  The photos are process-quality, meaning they look just like the prints from the local drugstore.  And they are economical too--just $25.00 for the film and paper kit, which yields 40 photos.

The movie feature on the camera is a blast.  You can record a little "slice of life" here and there--you will probably views these short movies more often than any VCR video!

The camera sells for about 329.00 and the printer sells for 199.00.

Believe me, you won't truly enjoy your digital camera--no matter how much you spend--unless you have an easy, economical way to produce a hard copy of the photos.  It's just not the same to view photos on a PC screen.  The Kodak EasyShare system solves this problem--it is a photographic marvel!
