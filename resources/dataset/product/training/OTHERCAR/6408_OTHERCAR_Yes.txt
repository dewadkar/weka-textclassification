            This car was purchased to replace a 89 Ford Taurus that died even though it only had 60K on it...never buy Ford again.  It was a close tie between the Intrigue and the Buick Regal.  Both shared the same characteristics except for Engine and Styling.  Both engines were amazingly powerful, except the Regal Turbocharged was little nicer.  However, since my parents aren't 80 and I would like to drive it every once in a while, we opted for the "younger" looking car.  

I can go on and on about the engine but you get the idea. As for styling, the car is smooth and is just perfect from the outside.  One bad thing I noticed is that the paint chips pretty easy when hit by a stone or a branch. Interior is comfortable with enough space for 3 in the back to set comfortably.  Sound system is really got for stock.  

Last but not least, the OEM tires, Goodyear Eagle LS, are horrible.  They are very noisy and did not last long.

Its truly a shame to see GM bring Oldsmobile down.  They did  at one time make some of the ugliest cars (Cutlass, 88, 99, etc...) but with the revamping they really produced the only appealing cars in my opinion from GM, Intrigue, Alero, and the Aurora.  But oh well, all good things must come to an end.
