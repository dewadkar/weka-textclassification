            Silver & black, premium package, 3.0. Daily driver.

Other cars I own are a 1997 Mazda Miata and a 2001 BMW M Coupe.  I also have spent significant time driving a 2001 Porsche 911 Cabriolet.

The engine is fabulous.  It has great torque and makes the most seductive sound, rendering the radio moot.  The 3.0 is easier to live with than the 3.2 in my M Coupe in that its less raw.  The interior is very nice, especially the wood accents.  The top does allow a bit of wind noise with the top up around the door seals.  Those who would say that wind noise is to be expected in a convertable have not ridden in a Mercedes SL or Porsche 996 Cabriolet.

The car handles great.  It lives up to the BMW boast, "We make our engines fast, but our suspensions faster."  Unlike the Miata, the Z3 transmits road irregularities with the "thwomp" associated with high quality luxury cars.

The interior is roomy enough for my 6'2", 33" inseam frame.  The premium sound system sounds great but is more prone to skipping than the unit that came with my Miata.  The skipping in my M Coupe indicates that this may be a chronic BMW problem.  The trunk is silly.

The exterior is a personal choice, but suffice it to say that after 5 years, this car still turns heads.

I wish the car came with Xenon HID headlights, rain sensor, auto-dimming mirror, auto-tilt-in-reverse passenger side mirror, fully automatic top, glass rear window, and steering wheel controls.  Of course, I've just listed items found in roadsters costing much more than the Z3 3.0.  Its merely nitpicking after all, I bought the car for the engine, and on that point, it has not let me down.

Other bonuses include the 3/year all service included warranty, and the fact that dealers are making drastic discounts right now.

If you're caught between the Miata/MR2/S2000 crowd and the 911/SL/XK8/SC430 crowd, this car provides alot of bang for the buck.
