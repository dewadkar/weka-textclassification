            I received this camera as a gift from my husband for Christmas after debating whether to buy one for the past couple of months.  I must say that this camera is simple to use, takes great quality pictures and came with wonderful software.

Pictures can be taken either with or without the LCD monitor on, has a flash and has zoom capabilities.  You can choose from three levels of photo quality with the lowest quality storing 40 images in the memory and the highest storing 16 (this is with the memory card (aka Flash Card) that came with the camera.  It also allows you to view images and or delete them when using the LCD display.

A cord came with the camera that allows you to plug into your computer to download the pictures.  The software is so easy to use and is right to the point.  Pictures are displayed in a view format so you can choose which ones you would like to view.

It also came with photo printing software that enables you to easily create album pages.

The only draw back to this camera is that unless you have an A/C adaptor, it drains batteries with almost every use.  Rechargables are a must.  Downloading from the camera to your computer can also be very lengthy but is not something you have to monitor so you can continue doing work.<br><br>
