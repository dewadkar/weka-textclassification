            I bought this camera in early 1999 on a whim.  I love electronic gadgets.  Since then, I've used the thing non-stop!  It's such an easy camera to use.  You don't need to be an electronics engineer to figure it out.  I don't even know where I've stashed my owners manual because I've never used it.  The best thing about this camera is the ability to delete a bad picture as easily as you took it.  There is no fear of how much it's going to cost to &quot;develop&quot; the film later, only to find out the pictures were horrible!  I also love being able to use the floppies, then download the pics from the floppies onto my hard drive or a CD.  I drag this thing with me everywhere!  And at family parties, it's a real hit to snap pictures, then pass the camera around for people to see the pictures right then and there.
The downsides are the cost of the camera and the picture quality.  The pics come out looking pretty darn good on the computer, but printing quality has been poor, I would imagine due to the number of &quot;pixels&quot;.  I had no clue what to look for when I bought this thing.  Now I want to buy one that will take better printing quality pictures for real &quot;keeper&quot; photography.  This Mavica is more like a toy to me.  The flash option on this camera is rather goofy.  I find it difficult to get the lighting just right about 25% of the time.  :(  One more downside, this camera takes about 2-4 seconds to record one picture.  So you can't do any fast repetitive snaps.  This is more of a &quot;catch em when they aren't looking&quot; or &quot;ok, hold still and say cheese&quot; kind of camera.

Overall, I would recommend this camera to folks who have extra cash to burn, who just want a fun toy to use hand in hand with their computer for e-mails, websites, etc.<br><br>
