            This car/home has been my savior I am a single women who needed a dependable ride through the desert's of LasVegas!Yes stand up to the heat and and travel back and forth from Oregon to California..and so on..
I now live in Hawaii and I am still driving this dream!It is classy clean and the computer tells u every detail of the car so u never miss any maintance.The car is a still ranging from 5k 2 9k.I got really lucky and only needed to paint the outside of the car to match me.A little personalization and you r driving in class for a great price.I still receive compliments daily.So the just starting out,small family,s,and practical people this is ideal for.By the way mine is champagne/chrome.
dark champagne leather seats.yeah stylin'.The love I have for this car makes it real hard to upgrade.And there is really no need.I have no car payments,ride feels like your floating (u gotta watch the speed!)
               
So if your a person with good taste and your cash doesn't match,u can get by with this luxry 98' Seville.enjoy..<br><br>
