            I'd always wanted a digital camera, but thought they cost too much.  My wife knew this, and utterly surprised me when she gave me the Polaroid PDC-640 as a gift.  

I was slightly spoiled on a mega-pixel camera I had borrowed from a friend, but the PDC-640 retailing at Wal-Mart for $179 really impressed me, at a fraction of the cost of some of the more expensive mega-pixel cameras.

What you get:  a decent camera with simple controls, color LCD preview screen, flash, multiple focus lens, easy PC connectivity and software, SmartMedia memory card slot, A/C adaptor to use the camera indoors on house current, and a nifty cable to display the pics on a TV with a video line in.

What you don't get:  zoom lens, mega-pixel crisp photos, much memory for taking hi-res photos, long battery life, decent photo album software.

What you might want to buy to go with it: rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, extra and larger SmartMedia cards, better camera bag to store the camera, extra SmartMedia and extra batteries.

I am notorious for snapping 35mm photos and tossing the film canister in a drawer without ever developing the film.  Snapping photos with the PDC-640 and storing off to CDR is easy, fun, and permanent.  Combine this one of those online print makers and you've got the best of both traditional and digital photography, at an easy to afford price.<br><br>
