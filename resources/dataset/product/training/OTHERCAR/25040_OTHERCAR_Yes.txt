This is a great camera with features not found on other brands like, six different image modes to select the picture quality you want, ISO settings (100, 200 & 400) for various lighting and action shots, image color modes - saturated, neutral, black and white, or sepia and much more.

This is an easy camera to use, just point and shoot or you can make all the settings you want manually. Installing the software is easy and after using it a while it is not hard to understand. Warranty is one year and extra accessories like lenses and filters are available.

<b>Updated 4-7-2001</b>
It takes great looking pictures and they print out beautifully as an 8 x 10 inch print. I haven't tried the 11" x 14" because my printer doesn't print them that large. The camera has a good feel to it and is balanced very well with the controls easy to reach. 

The latest price is now down to $427.95 if you look at Epinions {Check Latest Prices} for the best possible price. This makes it a great value for a quality digital camera.
