            I live in Central Mass where the weather in the winter has both ice and snow.  My driveway below the road grade and is on a numbered road which is quite busy, and the snow plows create a slush bank 12 inches high.  I also like to take a hilly back road to work in the morning.

I had traded in a 10 year old legacy wagon for this vehicle.  There is no comparison even when the 91 was new.  Of course bad weather handling, traction are great.  I have made it up my driveway on a sheet of ice, and between the full time all wheel drive and the anti-lock brakes I can go and &quot;stop&quot; as I want.

The car is very comfortable and deals with bumpy roads as if they were not there.  The handling is very good and response is almost instantaneous.

There is enough power to cruise at 90 on the Mass Pike.  Putting the back seat down has allowed me to fit a couch and a 6 foot bookcase in the car.

The only bad thing about the car is the rather annoying alarm system, which you must buy in order to get the remote.  One button does on and off.  Even if the car is unlocked you may have to push the alarm button.

Gas mileage is 23 mpg.  Nothing has gone wrong with the car at all.<br><br>
