            I have really enjoyed my Wrangler.  Although, I still enjoy the sight of the traditional CJ, the Wrangler has much more in the area of comfort.  My current Wrangler only has a V-4 engine.  I hesitated getting a V-4 instead of the 258 V-6, but I have no complaints.

I have two friends with similar Wranglers with the 258 V-6 and each have had problems with their engines around the 100k mark.  Although, my V-4 doesn't carry as much weight in the towing arena, it has been going on 120k without any problems.

For those of you thinking about a Jeep, there are some pros and cons.  A Wrangler can be a fun vehicle to drive (especially top down in the summer).  Also, the dirtier it gets, the better it looks.  Yet, you do give up the comfort of a smooth ride and the plush interior of most passenger cars and SUVs.  Also, many older Jeeps don't have creature comforts like A/C.  So, be careful and make sure you get what you want.

The later Wrangler models (after 1993) have an improved roll cage which certainly makes you feel more comfortable.  The truth is that driving in the Jeep with the kids is fun but not the safest means of travel - so any extra protection is welcome.  Wranglers with this new roll cage don't cost that much more than one of the earlier models - so just keep that in mind.

If you are looking for fun or you need a durable utility vehicle (for hunting or just a good run in the mud) - the Wrangler will serve you well.  I have taken mine off-road numerous times and it has always handled well.  Particularly, I like the versatility.  I can put the top up and stay warm in the winter.  I can drop the top and enjoy the breeze in the summer.  I can bolt on my roof rack or my trailer hitch rack and load up with enough gear to go just about anywhere.  Most of all, my kids love it as much as I do - they fight over who gets to go in the Jeep.

Just a few cautionary words about older Jeeps.  You can get a good deal but be careful.  Have the engine checked out.  If there is a new engine - try to at least find out an estimate of the miles on that engine.  Check the transmission - several friends of mine with manual transmissions in their Jeeps have started to have some problems (trouble getting into first and reverse).  These are just indications of problems to come.  Also, CV joints probably need replacement (they did on mine).  Check for rust in the body - particularly the front floorboards.  Nothing could be worse than buying a Jeep only to have to replace the engine or rebuild the body (unless you like doing that sort of thing).  I am not a mechanic, but I did not hesitate to pay a few bucks to have my mechanic go over my Wrangler with a fine tooth comb before I bought it.

A Jeep is a fun vehicle but not that practical.  If you really must have the comfort of a car and the look and feel of a Jeep then you really should look at the 1997 and later models.  I have two friends with such newer Jeeps.  The ride is much smoother and the interior comfort is equal to a car.  Yet, if you are like me - give me a dirty well broken in Jeep - one with character and charisma.  Driving a Jeep is not only fun but look around at the other Jeep owners and watch them wave at you in your Jeep - you will quickly see that you are part of the Jeep family.<br><br>
