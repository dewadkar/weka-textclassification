            I bought my 1996 Neon Sport brand new--my first new car, in fact.  I didn't want to spend much money, and this was the cheapest Chrysler product I could find (gotta go where you get the family discount, right?)
I decided on a black 4-door DOHC with a manual transmission, and the upgraded engine (150 bhp).  I'm really glad I got the manual--it's not a very quick little car, but it seems (and sounds) a lot quicker with a stick shift.
I've owned this car for just over 3 years now, and have put nearly 90,000 miles on it.  The only problem I've had occurred recently--my &quot;check engine&quot; light came on.  A quick check showed the problem to be related to the EGR valve.  Fascinating.
After doing a bit of research, both on and off the Internet, I found out what an EGR valve is and what it does.  The problem could have been one of three parts; my husband and I decided to replace all three (about $90).  Still much cheaper than taking it to a dealership or other shop to figure out which part(s) had gone bad, and then letting them fit it.
Anyway, other than this minor glitch, it's been a good car.  The gas mileage is great--at least 30 miles to the gallon (I do a lot of highway driving).  It handles well, and is pretty comfortable.
However, it's definitely showing it's age--feels like it's not driving quite as smoothly as it used to, and when I first start it up, there's an odd noise coming from the engine (as if I were low on oil, even when I'm not).  Although I was recently told at the oil change place that I have a small oil leak...
And come to think of it, I've noticed some vibration in the steering wheel, especially at highway speeds.  Even after replacing the tires and checking the front end alignment.  Curious.
So...in conclusion, I'd have to say that the Neon is a great inexpensive car, but not a good idea if you plan to keep it more than about 75k miles.

This just in...
