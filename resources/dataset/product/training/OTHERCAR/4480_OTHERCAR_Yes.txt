            A Mercedes Benz for under $35,000,and built in America to boot! What could be better? These were my thoughts prior to the first test ride of the new ML320 just going on sale. I promptly took a test ride and even more quickly, I placed my deposit. A short 6 month wait, and my new Benz arrived on the floor of the local MB dealers showroom.
Of course, no one buys the $35,000 variety of Benz,and the 6 month wait enabled me to save the additional $6,000 that it ended up costing. The ML exudes a quiet competence. The ride, though much more comfortable than the Ford Explorers that I had owned before,was never mistaken for a luxury passenger car.The handling exhibited the tautness one would expect from a German sport vehicle.
There seemed to be fewer bells and whistles than the well dressed Explorer,but those same bells and whistles seemed unnecessary, almost too vulgar in their excess.The seats had no lumbar adjustment,nor was any needed.
The new ML was not without flaws.Trim pieces around the front pillar fell off, a junction box for the AC lines at the firewall blew off (much to everyone's surprise while the vehicle was parked for over an hour),the spring loaded cupholders came unsprung and the rear latch came apart for no apparent reason.
The Mercedes dealership had an arrogance that I find somewhat repulsive.The manner in which they handled my trade-in almost brought the deal to an end before it got started.The sales rep was condescending,offering well below fair trade value for my old vehicle. This was all the more galling in that the dealership promised a fair accounting while offering over $2000 less for my trade in than I was able to obtain by offering the vehicle wholesale at the nearest Ford dealership.
Overall, I truly enjoy the ML320. I did not enjoy the purchase process.
