            I purchased a 2000 last year in July, and not one day goes by that I don't wish someone had stopped me.  

My subaru has the same problem with power as others have commented about. Initially, pedal to the medal and....zero power!  Then when it finally gets going sometimes the kickback is so bad I think the transmission is going to drop on the road. I have never said anything of this condition thinking it was just &quot;My Car&quot; but it has become clear that is is not only my car but &quot;Subaru's&quot; problem.

My BIG problem with my Subaru is with starting. Sometimes it just won't start.  Especially in the summer when it is very hot.
In the beginning I thought it was due to it being a new car.  After several months of not starting or stalling I went to the dealer.  At first the Dealership was open to the problem.  Then after none of the Subaru Technicians could figure it out it became my problem.  I have learned that if the car does not act up when at the dealership then...you out of luck.  When I couldn't get help from the dealership, I contacted Subaru.  Who told me the same story.  Along with no call backs and no sympathy I was fed up. 


My end problem was that I had paid the dealership and bought the car therefore it has now become my problem.

On the other had my Subaru gets good gas mileage for an all wheel drive vehicle and handles very well in all types of environments.

I was disappointed with this car, since I had heard so many good things about this company and car.  The only light at the end of this tunnel is that I leased this vehicle and have only 2 years left.

Good luck!<br><br>
