            Now, when my husband and I needed a new car, we spent about 30 minutes at a general dealership before we realized that this kind of shopping wasn't for us.

With a child on the way, we knew we wanted a wagon (no SUV's here, please!) and a reliable car.

From the start, the SW1 seemed a little small to me. But in 1998, it was the only sized wagon that Saturn offered. So we bought it. It's still a little small, and we can't afford to upgrade yet, but we didn't buy the Saturn for the car as much as we bought the Saturn for the company.

They value their employees, treat them with respect, and by golly, we get invited to a Saturn party every year. (We've never been yet!) So should you buy a car if it isn't everything you want?

Absolutely. At Saturn, they'll tell you the price (it's fair), they'll leave you alone, and every 3 months after you buy your car, you'll go back to the dealership to get your car poked and prodded, and they'll still treat you as if you really are somebody.	<br><br>
