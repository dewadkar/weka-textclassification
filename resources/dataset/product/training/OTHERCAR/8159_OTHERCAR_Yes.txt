            This is my first camera. I have enjoyed it very much. I think it very easy to use. Although I have never had another camera, I have used some of my friends and I really like mine the best. I have had it for over 2 years and have used it weekly putting 62 pictures on it at once and then transferring them to the web for ebay. You won't go wrong on this one as far as I am concerned. The directions say that you will use up a set of batteries taking 15 pictures. I bought a power pack and just plug it into my camera and then my batteries last longer.Then if you have to go outside you still have batteries. <br><br>
