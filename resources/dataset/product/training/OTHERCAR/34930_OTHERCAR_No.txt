        I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.


       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my experience, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision.      

            When Oldsmobile went to the &quot;W&quot; body in the late 80's they started a <b>very interesting concept</b> in automotive component design. Instead of the old straight axle coil spring rear suspension found on most other General Motors front wheel drive cars that preceded them, the &quot;W&quot; body cars including the Cutlass Supreme, Chevrolet Lumina, and Buick Regal went to a complete four wheel independent suspension. This configuration features a <b>space age fiberglass composite material</b>, horizontally mounted rear leaf spring/ MacPherson strut type rear suspension.

     It seems that for the most part G.M. was successful. In the time since these have been introduced I have had ample opportunity to work on these suspensions and have found some very good, but very bad things about this line. Since this style is very popular, and in my area of the country all of the G.M. names are well represented, I have found somewhat of a continuing trend in these.

    First off I love the fact that the front struts on this line of vehicles is actually a cartridge, accessed from under the hood. You will need special tools to replace these cartridges, but total time done by a qualified specialist should be well under an hour. If you own, or are looking to buy one of these cars, and you find you need front strut replacement, do not let the garage overcharge you for labor or tell you it will require re-alignment after because it is not so. If you sound well informed you should be able to let the service writer in on the fact that you know the time line for replacement, and the fact the alignment will not change in the least, and so <b> tell him you will not be overcharged</b>. The factory front strut cartridges should last close to 70,000 miles if not more.

    The rear struts are a whole other story. For some reason the rear struts on the &quot;W&quot; body's fail miserably. The seals fail and all of the oil leaks out, causing a rough ride and clunking from the rear over bumps. These do not usually last much more than 40,000 miles, but some, under the best of conditions will go longer. Also I have seen the rear strut mounts fail on a regular basis, having the metal sleeve come un-bonded from it's rubber housing. When the time does come to have rear struts replaced, have the mounts replaced along with them and save yourself another trip to the shop later. You will need a four wheel alignment after a rear strut job, so expect it. The rear suspension arms are horizontally mounted along with that spring and are very weak laterally, so if you get stuck in snow or mud, be very careful not to hook anything around these arms since they bend very easily and throw the rear alignment out a great deal.

   The front steering system is typical rack and pinion, strut type, but with a twist. Neither the ball joints nor the outer tie rods are greasable and tend to wear prematurely. It seems the life expectancy of most of the front end parts on these vehicles is about the same, so by the time you notice something amiss in the front end it is due for a complete overhaul. The inner tie rods are also a weak link, but not so much as the other previously mentioned parts. The complete front end rebuild is moderately expensive so be forewarned.

     Now comes the twist. Usually on front struts the pivot bearing is mounted high up on the strut assembly, usually in the strut tower area, but on the &quot;W&quot; body's, it is under the bottom of the coil spring and is not very well sealed off from road grit and dirt. I have seen many of these vehicles with <b>memory steer</b>. Memory steer is a condition where the spring does not rotate with the bearing as it should smoothly, and when you steer in a particular direction the steering wheel does not return to center. The spring winds up, but does not release which causes the condition, and that in turn makes the car seem like it has a pull. The only remedy is replacing the bearing, and that is costly.

   If you are looking at the possible purchase of one of these vehicles, check to see if any or all of these items listed has already been replaced. If not, then it would be to your advantage to bring it to a trustworthy mechanic to check the front end thoroughly, as well as the rear struts and arms. When these vehicles are in good repair they are excellent riding and handling cars. It is just that they are built with sub par steering and suspension components. Once the steering parts in question are replaced they should have the ability to be greased and should carry a lifetime warranty. Be careful and get things checked out before you buy. Don't be on the wrong end of a <b>caveat emptor</b>.
