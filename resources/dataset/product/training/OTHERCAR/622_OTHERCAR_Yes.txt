            I have had my eye on the Nikon Coolpix 950 for a while and decided to act on buying it a few weeks ago when I saw the price drop and the rebate program start.  When the camera was released about 9 months ago it had an MSRP of $1000.  I was able to get the camera for the low price of $549 (after rebate).  My local Costco has it for $699 after rebate.  I bought it at Camera World (free shipping, no sales tax, good service).<br>
<br>
<b>The Pros:</b><br>
+ The <b>LCD</b> is great - much bigger than the Kodak 280 (280 is a $100 more)<br>
+ The <b>Quality</b> of the Nikon is unsurpassed.  The camera has a metal casing, not the plastic garbage almost all others are made of.<br>
+ <b>Expandability</b> - You can add wide-angle lens, telephoto and various lenses to the camera.<br>
+ <b>Ergonomics</b> - The way the camera is designed, split movement, takes a little getting used to but it is far superior to the traditional lens on front, image on back.  For one, the camera allows you to view self portraits or those ever-so-fun self shots with buddies.  You can also aim the camera in different directions without having to move your body to view the LCD.  Believe me, this is a superior design.<br>
+ Options - the camera is easy to use for beginners but has enough <b>fun options</b> for more seasoned shutterbugs.  I have had the camera for a few weeks and am still learning some of the advanced functions.<br>
<br>
<b>The Cons</b>:<br>
- The <b>serial connection</b> is WAY slow.  The Nikon designers should be reprimanded accordingly.  Worth purchasing the USB Card reader for $75<br>
- <b>8 MB card</b>.  Come on, this is way too small to use in MB hungry cameras.  The thing I liked about the Kodak 280 is that it came with more MB.<br>
- <b>Batteries</b> last about 30 photos worth of time.  Buy rechargeable high-output batteries that will last about 10X that amount (add $40).<br>
- OK, this is nit picky but the camera <b>lens cover</b> doesn't come with a cord so when you take it off it prevents you from losing it.<br>
- The software has <b>frozen</b> a couple of times on me when I have uploaded to the computer.  I am stuck opening the battery case and shutting it to reset it.<br>
- The software <b>does not support TWAIN</b>.  Nikon says that the drag and drop software that comes with it is superior.  I agree and disagree.  It is easy to use the drag and drop  but without TWAIN support you are forced to perform an unnecessary step to import into programs.  With TWAIN support you can just download the images off the camera directly into applications.  Without it you have to drag and drop the images from the camera to a folder then open the picture through the application (such as Photoshop).  Nikon, you say drag and drop is superior but the people demand TWAIN.  Who are you designing this for anyway?<br>
<br>
<b>Overall this camera is an excellent choice</b> for avid film-based photographers to buy.  It, so far, has demonstrated Nikon's attention to detail and quality.  At $549 you won't find a better camera.<br>

Update: I bought a SanDisk USB Compact Flash reader from Buy.com for $22 and it is amazing.  The download time is a fraction (a very small fraction) and there is NO battery use (which is the biggest drain anyway).  Highly recommended.  Buy this option!<br>

Update : I also bought a 64 MB card from Buy.com for the lowest price I have seen on the Internet.  What a difference.  Now, I don't have to worry about how many photos are left.  I haven't come close to running out of space yet.  In addition, I shoot everything at maximum resolution without a worry (2.1 Megapixels).  <br><br>
