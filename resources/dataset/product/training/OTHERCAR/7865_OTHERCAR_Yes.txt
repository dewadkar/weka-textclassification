            With BMW electing to drop four-cylinder engines for its 3 Series cars in the U.S., the 318i goes on hiatus for 2000. All 3s will be powered by DOHC inline-sixes (2.5-liter/170-horsepower and 2.8-liter/193-horsepower). However, a new Coupe-in 323Ci and 328Ci guises-joins the new-in-'99 323i and 328i sedans, which carry over virtually unchanged. Finally, a 323i sport wagon also arrives for those who need a bit more practicality with their performance. The current E36-based convertible will be replaced by one based on the new platform sometime in early 2000. And while there'll be no M3s for the new model year, a new M3 Coupe should appear for 2001, with a sedan likely to follow. It is really fun to drive and has ivory leather embedded to the passenger seat. The BMW has impecable quality. The car even smells good ( so does every other new car)
