            I have owned my Toyota RAV4 for almost 2 years. I wanted something with more interior room than I'd had in my pickup truck, but I still wanted to be able to haul and tow. After scouring the web and reading multiple reviews, I decided to give the RAV4 a test drive. On the very same day I test drove a Ford Explorer, a Mitsubishi Montero Sport, and a Jeep Cherokee.

The price tag on the Explorer took that vehicle out of consideration almost immediately. The Jeep did not ride as comfortably, nor did it seem to handle as well on the rain-slicked pavement. The Montero Sport seemed a little too thin in its construction and was a bit more noisy both at highway speed and in city driving.

The RAV had everything I wanted and needed. I managed to find a full-time 4wd, 4-door RAV. Power windows and locks, power sunroof, CD player. The sticker price wasn't a huge shock at just over $16,000. Thanks to a rather delayed delivery, the dealership also provided the luggage rack and aluminum alloys wheels. I purchased the hood bra, cargo net, and cargo cover on my own.

In the past two years of driving the RAV in both city and highway environments, I have had no complaints about anything with the exception of the rear speakers. The gas mileage remains rather consistent, at around 23 mpg. The vehicle has handled well in rain, snow, ice, and mixed conditions. The clearance keeps the vehicle from bottoming out on some of our neighborhood dips and potholes, but it's so much that my wife can't get into the vehicle when she's wearing a dress. We have taken the RAV even on 10 hour drives without suffering from the bump, sway, and cramped confines of other vehicles.

I have been able to haul loads of dogfood, camping gear, luggage, auction treasures, and groceries. The RAV4 has spoiled me! I would recommend this SUV to anyone who is looking for a small to mid-sized SUV. Toyota can provide as much or as little luxury as most people are searching for. If, however, you are looking for the giant SUV with every imaginable convenience, the RAV4 is not for you. I'm sure there is a Cadillac out there with your name on it though.<br><br>
