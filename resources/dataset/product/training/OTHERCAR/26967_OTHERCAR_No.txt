            Mitsubishi Motors really grabbed my heart with this car.  I purchased a Black Mitsubishi Galant 2000.  I rides as smooth as a air plane on clouds, and the engine is quiet.  It has the get up and go you need to fight traffic sporting a 2.4l 4cyl engine.  The body style is very attractive, and I get nothing but compliments.  Most people say my car looks like a BMW, and thats what I thought when I first saw it.  Rumor has it that the car actually sets on a BMW frame.  Beemer without the Beemer cost.  Best yet, its made in the USA!

Not just the big things impress me about the car, but the little things as well.  

It comes standard with a factory cd player.  I get tired of these moron car manufacturers that think Tapes are still in vogue, or better yet, the ones who just put in a stock radio with no tape or cd player.

It has 2 cigarette lighters. I'm sorry, but one just doesn't cut it any longer.  At any given time, I have my cell phone charger and radar detecter going, and sometimes when I have passengers, there is a laptop connected.

It is very roomy.  I don't get phobic just sitting down in the car.  
The trunk space is enough to hold a luggage for 4 people, a top of the line stereo system with sub woofers, and still have room for an ice chest.

Its got a nifty anti theft protection where you can only start the car with the radio transmitter enabled key that comes with it.  I can travel to big cities without worry.  

On top of all the little things thats impressive, the final word on the car is that its just my style.  Its a very affordable car that makes me feel like i'm riding at the edge of luxury.  Its got class and speed, and quality that makes me feel it will last a very long time.<br><br>
