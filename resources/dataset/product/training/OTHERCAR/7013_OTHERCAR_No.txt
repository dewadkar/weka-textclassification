            About 10 months ago we purchased a 2000 Land Cruiser. It's a great car to take to the Country Club and show off to your friends, but after a little while we were spending more time in a rental Toyota compact than our own SUV. I'll come back to that point later in my opinion! First, the many luxuries of owning a Cruiser. The leather interior and large driver and passenger seats makes this car comfortable to drive and ride in. We have taken two fairly long road trips since we purchased our Cruiser and it was very comfortable both times.  The six-CD player is also a nice option for long trips. We did notice, however that the trunk held almost no luggage. Folding down half of the back bench helped, but being a longtime SUV owner this trunk is glaringly small. When sitting in the rest of the far bench, I was slightly uncomfortable. The bench felt like it had a board under the leather and there is very little foot room. The Land Cruiser runs very smoothly but does require frequent tank fill-ups. 

Now, onto some of our personal problems with our Land Cruiser. These problems may not be present in all Toyotas. Our auto has been in the shop over four times in the last month which makes us eligible for the Florida Lemon Law. We recently filed against Toyota. The engine light flashes almost constantly and each time we take it to our local dealership, a new part is ordered and we get stuck with a tiny rental for about five days. The Cruiser is high on luxury, not to mention price, and on mechanical difficulties.
