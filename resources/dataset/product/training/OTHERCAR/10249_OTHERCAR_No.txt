                 I purchased my 3000GT VR-4 two years ago.  I was experiencing an early mid-life crisis!  It turns out that my car was the cure to a majority of all my worries.  I like to think that my car put allot more hair on my head!  I wanted something sleek looking and sporty, but affordable.  The VR-4 is &quot;beyond a shadow of a doubt&quot; the blue-collar individual's Ferrari Testerosa.  I like the car because it has become somewhat of an extension to my body.  People who own the VR-4 do not consider it as just a car.  I myself have a relationship with mine.  The VR-4 corners like its on rails and gives me bragging rights to say that I am &quot;The King of the Road&quot;!  The combination of appearance and performance is mind-boggling.  It sounds crazy, but when I sit in the cockpit, I feel as if I am fulfilling a young desire to fly the F-15 Eagle.  Although McDonald Douglas rules the air, Mitsubishi has taken the cake on the ground.  There is no grey area for hate with this car.  As I mentioned earlier, driving the car is like flying a plane.  Let's step into the car and look under the hood.  The VR-4 has only one upgrade from factory (a sunroof), everything else is standard; pushbutton active aero, adjustable rear fin, all wheel drive, all wheel steering, push button sport/tour suspension, etc.  The VR-4 houses a 3.0 Liter, V-6, Twin-turbo engine that quitely pushes its estimated 3,700 lb body and internals at speeds that are phenomenal.  Surprisingly, there are actually no dials in the car!  It's harder to drive a golf ball 80 yards with a three wood than to drive this car.  The car actually adjusts to the driver.  I have reached speeds of up to 45 miles an hour before shifting into second gear.  Vice-versa, I have downshifted at speeds of 130 plus mph and the transitions were extremely acceptable and smooth.  Mitsubishi's 3000GT VR-4 was designed around its operator.  &quot;Wake up and Drive&quot;!     <br><br>
