            We bought the Smile on impulse and it was on sale.  We had been looking at digital cameras and sadly we did not do our research!  This is basically a child's toy...the quality of the photo was very poor. And later found out that it for use on the internet and email--the things I sent were not very good and we promptly returned it! If you are wanting to send some mediocre quality photos or upload some blur to your site, this is the camera for you!  And if you are a mind reader and know how to get ESP instructions from the maker you are going to love this camera!  Needless to say I will be giving the camera we purchased 2nd a rave review....for an additional 70 dollars we bought a camera by the same maker and it is 7 times the camera the Smile is. Don't be cheap, be smart and do your research. The only thing I liked about the Smile was its size!<br><br>
