            I wanted to replace an all-wheel drive Subaru Impreza.  It had been a great snowy road car; it was incredibly reliable; but, it was underpowered, very small, and now it was just getting old.  AND, I wanted not just on-road capability -- I wanted REAL off-road stuff:  a LOW range for the transmission, enough ground clearance to actually climb over rutted dirt roads and even small rock/boulder fields, room to haul gear, etc.

I'd tried them all before I bought my other Subaru (a '97 Outback, bless its soul); a quick review of those few years' changes told me:  Explorer is STILL the worst (don't even need to include the exploding tires); mechanically, Land Rovers are still down there with the Ford; Land Cruiser (and that it-just-costs-more-because-it's-the-&quot;premium&quot;-division cousin of the Cruiser) STILL cost WAY too much; the Grand Cherokee still has the smallest back seat room and gets LOUSY mileage; the Chevrolet Suburban is still the largest Land Yacht ever devised by humankind, and Trooper is still... well, just a Trooper.  How about the new ones?

Durango?  A truck, just a truck.  Mercedes?  Stick it with the Cruiser/Lexus.  BMW?  Give me a break!  Cadillac, Lincoln?  Break me up!  What haven't I roasted except the itsy-bitsy Toyotas and Suzukis and ... AHHH...THE ONE I'd wanted back in late 1996 when my budget told me to settle for the Outback -- the full-size Mitsubishi Montero, not to be confused with the new, smaller Mitsubishi Montero Sport. SO, now I've had a 2000 Mitsubishi Montero Endeavor for 5,000 miles, and I know what I think of it -- REALLY!

Smooth . . . car-like ride; yet, stiffer dampening, as required to deal with those REAL back country rutted deer paths!  Reliable . . . as much as 5,000 miles can tell you:  not a single problem.  REAL back country experience:  superb!  AND, it does so with all the luxury road feel of any Mercedes I've ever ridden in (The Endeavor has the leather seats, real wood dash inserts, digital electronic compass and outside temperature display, etc.).  Drawbacks?  It won't run with a gas-guzzling V8 on the highway; don't even try.  WATCH OUT FOR LOW OVERHEADS; this thing makes Cherokees, etc. look SHORT! However, it's not all that big overall -- that '97 Outback is several inches LONGER!  Recommendation:  I was right in 1996; and, through the 2000 model years, the Montero is still the ONE!
