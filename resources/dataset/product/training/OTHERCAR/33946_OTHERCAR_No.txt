            I purchased this vehicle because I stumbled across it on a Volkswagon lot, drove it and loved it!  I have been driving it now for almost 2 years. The fun was over about a month ago!!!

First, 2,000 miles out of warranty an electrical cluster shorted in the dash which rendered the odometer useless.  The dealer quoted me at least $450 to repair.  To Volkswagon's credit they did cover it under warranty, after I called and complained directly to Volkswagon.  The dealer wouldn't go to bat for me.

Second, two days after getting it out of the dealer for the cluster repair, the check engine light came on.  A vacuum hose had a leak in it. The cost to replace the $10 part was $100 with labor.

Third, two weeks after getting it back from the dealer for replacing the vacuum hose (which at that time a complete check was done to find out what was wrong), the battery dies due to no fault of mine.

Each time I had the car in for service, the standard answer from the dealer was &quot;well these things happen&quot;.  It is amazing to me that a two year old car could start having so many problems.  What could be next?

I decided after purchasing this car that I would drive it for a few years and let my daughter have it when she was 16 to drive back and forth to school and activities. I could finally stop taking time from work to be &quot;taxi mom&quot;.  But now I'm afraid I would become &quot;rescue a stranded child mom&quot;.

I am not going to keep the car longer than it takes me to find a good replacement.<br><br>
