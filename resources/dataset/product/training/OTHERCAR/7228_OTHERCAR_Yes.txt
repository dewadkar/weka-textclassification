            I bought my '99 Mercury Cougar from a Chevrolet dealership a year ago. It was a trade-in from an elderly couple who wanted a car with a smoother ride. This was a good thing for me, because I was able to buy a virtually new car for $4,000 under MSRP for an almost identical 2000 model.

My first six months with this car were rough. I had three problems with the car (2 of them major), which wasted a bunch of my time to have fixed. Fortunately, they were all covered by my warranty.

Problem #1: The power trunk lid wouldn't open with the remote control or internal trunk release. The Ford dealer had to order parts to fix it, which took two multi-hour trips to the dealer to get the problem resolved.

Problem #2: The dealer screwed up the power door locks after a doing a safely recall repair on them. The locks periodically relocked themselves when I unlocked them! This took three dealer trips to fix.

Problem #3: The neutral safety switch went bad, causing the car to occassionally not start. This took two dealer trips to fix.

In total, that's 7 trips back to the garage in six months. Once I got the bugs worked out, the car ran great ever since. The car accelerates quickly, brakes well, and can handle almost any curve without complaints. Like other people who reviewed this car, I got a "Low coolant" light when parking on a hill, but I fixed this problem by adding ever-so-slightly overfilling the coolant tank.

This car also looks great, and certainly sticks out in a parking lot filled with SUV's and Minivans. Normally, this is good thing, except that it also grabs the attention of police as well.

I never got a single ticket while I was driving my Escort for five years, but I got THREE tickets in my one year of driving the Cougar. I've literally have had cops following me around when I drive through small towns, just waiting for me to make a mistake so they can fine my sorry butt. Needless to say, my insurance has tripled since I got this car, as well. I can't really blame the car for this, but it is something to think about before buying a sports car.
