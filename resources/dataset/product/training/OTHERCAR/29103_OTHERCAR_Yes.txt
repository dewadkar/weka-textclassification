               I recently purchased a 1999 Toyota Tacoma Prerunner, which is high off the ground like a 4WD but only 2WD.  The one I purchased has everything you can get on one, i.e. pwr locks, pwr windows, pwr steering, automatic transmission w/overdrive, cruise control, factory installed alarm, am/fm stereo-cassette-cd, air cond., all the options.  And the engine, 3.4 ltr V6 with overhead cam, 24 valves, and PLENTY of power.
  A VERY nice riding truck with plenty of horses to get you down the road!  For someone who might occasionally go off road for whatever reason, but not real rough terrain, this is the perfect vehicle.  Plenty of ground clearance, and a smooth ride, as well.
  The only thing I wish my truck had was a clock in it.  Most have them.  I just happened to get one that didn't, but the rest of the truck made up for it.
  I like the option of the locking rear differential.  If I am ever in mud, and get stuck, I can simply press a button, and the rear differential locks, making it a positive-track rear end, making it easier to get out.
  I drove several trucks before I purchased this one.  However, none had the options, power, and handling as this one did.  So, it was a very easy decision.  Toyota...is there anything else?<br><br>
