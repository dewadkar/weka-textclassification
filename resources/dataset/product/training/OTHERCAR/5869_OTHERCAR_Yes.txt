            I own a 1994 Saab 9000 CSE.  Over the first four years, it was a pleasant, trouble-free, luxurious, beautiful car with sufficient power and cool features.  However, over the last two years, I've had several problems with the car.

But first, I'll discuss the cars good points.  It's very good looking, the sleek headlights &amp; foglights are very contemporary (for a 6 year old car), and the dimmed turn signals, and light design in the back are spectacular.  Inside, the car looks like a cockpit.  Everything is centered around the driver, making it easy-to-use and truely comfortable.  The Sound system is more than adequate, providing symphonic sound for almost any kind of music.  The seats are comfortable, though after a while you'll need a stretch.  The best part of this car is it's A/C system, with climate control settings by temperature; also, the heated seats, power windows, power moonroof and power seats are a must.  I guarantee you'll never find a better moonroof, it's fabulous.

Now, the cons.  Right off the bat, I can tell you gas mileage isn't gonna be great.  I usually get about 16 to 20 in the city, and about 20 to 23 on the highway.  Not bad, but it's only that good when I'm careful.  Another bad area is the foglights which seem to burn out every 6 months.  If it's not the left, then it's the right.  The biggest problem for me has been pot-hole damage.  This car can't take a hit to save it's life.  I've had to spend almost 1000 dollars on replairs related to potholes, each time having to change the entire wheel AND tire.  We're not talking crater hits, but just sudden jolts.  Lastly, I've had problems with the wipers, the brakes, and the suspension.  It's cost me a lot of money, but so far I haven't given up on the old girl.

She still gets ooh's and aah's from friends... and she sure looks good after a good wash.  I reccommend it.<br><br>
