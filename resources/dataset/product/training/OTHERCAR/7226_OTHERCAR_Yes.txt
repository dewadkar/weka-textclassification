            The 1999 Mercury Cougar V6 is a superb value.  It has a very large trunk, excellent handling and good acceleration.  In addition, it comes standard with impressive options (power everything).  Make sure you get a manual transmission.  The automatic transmission for this car is clunky and non-responsive.  It really holds back the acceleration.  However, with the Manual transmission the car is great.  The V6 is excellent (Very smooth).  I also recommend the sport package, largely because of the larger 16&quot; wheels.  The Cougar is like an Acura Integra with a V6 and huge trunk.<br><br>
