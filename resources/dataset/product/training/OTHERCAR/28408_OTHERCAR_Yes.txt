              The Nissan Maxima is a wonderful car!  I am not normally so blunt, but this is my favorite...maybe because it�s the main car I drive.  It has so many wonderful qualities, and so few negative ones.  If you like the feel and power of a sports car, with the room and features of a luxury car, then this is the one for you!
  It handles like a dream.  You can barely tell that your driving--it�s more like gliding. Bumps and holes in the rode just smooth out when you are in this car.  It is extremely comfortable, and can hold many.  I�m not going to say an exact number, because it depends on the size of the people!
  Some of the features on mine are a sunroof (actually, I think it�s called a moonroof because it has a cover on it.)  The stereo provided with the car is very nice for a factory system, although the bass isn�t that great.  The drivers seat is automatic and you control both the back and the bottom.  The back can tilt forward and back.  The bottom can go
forward and back, and up and down.  That�s a real big plus for us short people!  One bad thing about it is the location of the trunk popper (I know that�s not what it�s really called, but it works for me.)  It is located on the driver door, towards the bottom.  Sometimes when you are reaching for your seatbelt it can get pushed.  It�s happened to me before on the freeway...not fun!  Especially if you knew how much is in my trunk.
  But, I would still recommend this car.  It is a wonderful automobile, and very reliable. The only problems I�ve ever had is with the sunroof, but not on this one, just one I owned previously.  So, if you�re looking for a new car in this price range with these features, I would suggest you give this one a try.  Good luck! <br><br>
