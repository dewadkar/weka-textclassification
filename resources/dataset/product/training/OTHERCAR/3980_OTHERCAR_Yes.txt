            We just purchased a 2000 LS1 a few months ago.  Saturn had perfect timing!  As our family was getting a little too big for the stand SL Saturns, we opted to buy Saturn #3, an LS1 and have no regrets.  There is plenty of head and leg room and the extra cigarette lighter in the back seat has been used countless times for our son's game boy adapters while traveling.    We bought traction control and that paired with anti lock brakes has proven a perfect combination for the snow/ice that we get here in North Dakota.  We are very pleased with braking system and have found it to be as reliable as our 4WD vehicle!  Nice looking car, performs great too! 

PS - the heated leather seats are sure nice on those -50 days :)<br><br>
