            When our tax return came back, first thing we went out looking for was a digital camera.  I wanted one that took good quality pictures, ones we can print out, was easy to use, one that could take good pictures of my kids playing outside and one that wasn't too expensive.  We looked at a few models and then we were shown the <b>Olympus D-490ZOOM</b>.  I instantly liked the camera, but when the sales lady at Epperson photo told us the price, I was a little hesitant, priced on sale at $499 when we looked at it on a Wednesday and it was going back up to it's original price of $599 on Saturday.  The price seemed a little more than we were thinking of paying, so we told her we had to think on it.  The next day we stopped in at Circuit City to see their selection and prices and found the camera on sale there for $449, regular price $499, big difference in my book!  Needless to say, we got the camera from Circuit City and I've been happy ever since.

<b>What the camera came with</b>

Included with the camera was an 8 MB SmartMedia memory card, 2 CR-3V long life lithium batteries, Windows and Macintosh serial cables, NTSC video output cable, CamediaMaster CD, strap, and a 143 page user guide.

My husband was a little disappointed that it came with serial cables and not a USB cable, but as long as I can take pictures and download to them to the computer, it really doesn't bother me.  It comes with the lithium batteries, but if you're in a pinch, you can also use four AA alkaline, NiMH or NiCd batteries.

<b>Features</b>

The features the camera has is usually the selling point of a digital camera and this one has quite a few, although some of them I don't really know what they are as I am not a camera buff.

* 2.1 Megapixels * 1600 x 1200 resolution * 3x optical zoom lens, plus 2.5x digital telephoto (f2.8-4.4 aspherical glass zoom * 35 - 105mm - 35mm equivalent) * TTL automatic white balance with 4 preset manual settings * TTL autofocus with 2 Quick Focus settings * Digital ESP matrix meter or spot meter * +/- 2 step exposure compensation * Programmed AE * 1.8" color LCD screen * 6 mode built-in flash, including red-eye reduction * Shutter speeds from 1/2 sec to 1/1000 sec. * Optical viewfinder

Unless you're a camera buff, a lot of these features are probably as foreign to you as they are me, but the important ones to me were the resolution, zoom, autofocus, built-in flash and the screen size. 

Another neat feature is that you can use this camera to take mini-movies in QuickTime format.  I haven't used it yet, but the instructions explain everything pretty clearly.  It also states that you can set the ISO manually, if you wish, I haven't tried this feature yet either, as I am not a photographer by nature, I just love taking pictures of my kids, but to a camera buff, I think this would be an important feature.

<b>Picture quality</b>

Now this was the main selling point for me for a digital camera.  With the <b>Olympus D-490ZOOM</b>, you have the choice 5 different qualities:  SQ, SQ-HIGH, HQ, SHQ and SHQ-TIFF.

SQ and SQ-HIGH are done in the 640 x 480 resolution, SQ has high compression and SQ-HIGH has low compression.  HQ, SHQ and SHQ-TIFF are all in 1600 x 1200 resolution, HQ has high compression, SHQ has low compression and SHQ-TIFF has no compression at all.

I have mainly used the HQ mode and the pictures have turned out great, I have tried the SQ-HIGH, but I wasn't really impressed with the picture quality, it seemed a little grainy to me, but that could be because I had been using the higher quality resolution before trying it.  I can fit 16 pictures in the HQ mode on my 8 MB memory card before having to download.  

<b>My experience so far</b>

So far, my experience with this camera has been great!  I have taken many pictures of my kids, both inside and outside and the pictures turned out great.  The camera is really easy to use and the onscreen menu is a snap to use and easy to understand without reading the entire manual before using it, yes, I'm guilty of using it before reading the instructions!  All the buttons are positioned nicely and are clearly marked as to what they are.  If you want to save on battery life, you can leave the LCD screen off and use the viewfinder, I have had no problem using the viewfinder even with my glasses on.  I have taken a lot of pictures of the kids outside playing and the camera does a pretty good job in stopping the action when it snaps the picture as they don't appear blurry because they are moving around.  The software is easy to load and use to edit pictures, although I do prefer to use my other picture editing software I have, I do use the software that came with the camera to do cropping and red-eye reduction, but I use my other one for touching up photos if they need it.  

<b>What do I like about this camera?</b>

I love the picture quality, it takes great pictures.  It has a wrist strap so if it slips, you won't drop it.  It is extremely easy to use to take pictures and the onscreen menu is easy to use also.  It's pretty lightweight, I can't really compare it to other cameras, but it's not a burden to carry around.  In the 1600 x 1200 resolution mode, it will print out about the size of a 8 x 10 picture, great for printing pictures and sending to family.  I haven't really gone in-depth into the user manual, but it seems to spell out quite clearly on how to use the camera and even gives tips on taking better pictures for the novice and advanced users.

<b>What don't I like about the camera?</b>

Well, even though it does have a built-in flash, you do have to manually open it up, but the camera itself will tell you if you need it or not, I have found that most of the pictures I take inside, that I have to use the flash, but that's really not a big problem.  My husband's biggest complaints about it is the fact that it didn't come with a USB cable and he wished it came with a larger memory card than the 8 MB it came with, but again, those aren't really biggies for me either.

<b>System Requirements</b>

Windows - Pentium or greater, Win 95/98/2000/NT 4.0, QuickTime 4.0 (also comes with the software), CD-ROM, 32 MB RAM, 100 MB available hard drive space, Standard RS-232 Interface (D-SUB 9-pin connector), monitor with 256 or more colors.

Macintosh - 601 Power PC or greater, MacOS 7.6.1 or greater, QuickTime 4.0 (also comes in the software), CD-ROM, 32 MB RAM, 100 MB available hard drive space, Standard RS-232 Interface (printer/modem port), Monitor with 256 colors or more.

<b>Conclusion</b>

All in all, I think that the <b>Olympus D-490ZOOM</b> is a great digital camera, it's easy to use, takes great pictures and has lots of features that even a camera buff would like.  I have taken at least 50 or more pictures with the camera so far and downloaded them to my computer and the batteries are still going strong, and most of the time I am using the LCD display when taking pictures.  I am very happy with the purchase of this camera and have no regrets.  It's ideal for parents for taking pictures of the kids and ideal for anyone who just loves to take pictures whether they be on a special trip or just regular snapshots, I definitely recommend this camera.
