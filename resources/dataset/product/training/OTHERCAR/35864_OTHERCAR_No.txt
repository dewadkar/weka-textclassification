            I ended up buying my 95 Lumina off my fiancee since she wanted to get an SUV and I needed a vehicle at the time.  I bought the car in August of 99 and it had approximately 50,000 miles on it.  Had absolutely no complaints about vehicle until summer of 2001 when I got a 'Low Coolant' light come on.  Could not locate source of coolant loss until one evening when I was driving home from work and heard virtually all the lifters ticking.  Pulled car over and found that antifreeze was getting into the oil.  My first thought was a bad head gasket.  After tearing the engine apart we found the lower intake manifold gasket was shot and the intake manifold itself had a flaw in the casting right where the water jacket comes through the rear head into the manifold.  Ended up replacing gasket and using JB Weld to fill in the pits in the casting.  Indicentally, I talked to another mechanic about the problem after I had it fixed, and he immediately knew what the problem was after I told him I was getting antifreeze in the oil.  According to him it is a very common problem on atleast 1995 3100 V6's as he has seen it on atleast 3 other vehicles with that engine and that year.  

Aside from these problems, my transmission lines runing from the transmission to the radiator cooler were leaking right at the crimp fitting where you go from rubber hose to steel tubing.  Both of those had to be replaced.  

To give the car credit, it does have decent power for a sedan as well as features such as power locks, windows, good head room, and alot of room in the trunk. However I would not recommend this vehicle based on the problems that I had with it.  I would go with something that has a 3.8L V6 as I hear those engines are rock solid.
