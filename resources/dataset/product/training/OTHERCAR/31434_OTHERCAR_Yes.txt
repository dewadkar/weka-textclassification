            Before buying this camera I read every review I could on all the other cameras under $600 in the 4-5MP range.  I have always had Sony Digital Cameras in the past, but due to their high pricing and slow release of the Memory Stick Pro I decided to go with Compact Flash.  Next I was faced with the decision to use a AA or Propietary batteries.  I do not like propietary batteries, as a Florida resident with two small children who love to frequently visit Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and Sea World, I really wanted to be able to pop in a gift shop and buy AA's.  The 4-5MP camera lineup that take AA's are small and frankly I wasn't impressed with any of them.  If you travel alot and don't have access to a charger than keep this fact in mind.  However, I can report that the NB-2L battery that comes with the camera lasts for about 300 shots.  Also You will need to purchase an additional CF Card.  The 32Mb card that comes with the camera holds about 14 pictures.  I bought a 1GB 30X CF Card and it holds about 400 pictures.  The photo quality is excellent and if you are a Macintosh user the software works well in OS X and the camera works well with iPhoto.  Also to note the optical zoom is 3X and the Digital zoom 4.1X which is average in this class.  The camera has red eye reduction and even with this setting you'll get red eye in your photos.  This is the case with all small body cameras and there are many applications that can quickly remove this.  This camera beats all others in its class in my book and is well worth the money.  My only issues were the propietary battery, 4-way navigation button as it is easy to select the wrong things in the menu and it would have been nice if it was firewire or USB2 compatible as each photo is between 2-3MB and can take a while to download into your computer.   I bought the camera at Brandsmart in Ft. Lauderdale for $540 and can be ordered online for about the same.  If MP isn't your top priority then check out the S45 as this is basically the same camera.
