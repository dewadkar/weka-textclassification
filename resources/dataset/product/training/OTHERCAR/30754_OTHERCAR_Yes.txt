            I was a skeptic on digital photography--and then I bought this camera.  The price was right, and I have to say that I am very impressed with the operation and the images produced by this camera.  I do some webpage design and sell items on an internet auction site and in the regular quality mode, they come out fine for either of these purposes.  At Christmas time I did some shots of the niece and nephew in the highest quality mode and then printed them out--the 4 x 6's and 5 x 7's came out great, and the 8 x 10 wasn't too bad, there were a few spots on it where you could see that it was a digital image.  I recently did another picture of an outdoor scene and printed it out in the 8 x 10 and it turned out great, I was very pleased. Overall I am very happy with this camera.

Now for the drawbacks--anyone who is a photography enthusiast will notice a lack of depth of field. It also sucks down alkaline batteries, so I resolved that problem by purchasing a set of nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries.  Download times can be very slow if you've shot the photos in the highest quality mode, but now there is a drive you can buy that you insert the cards into--it plugs into a USB port--and it speeds that up considerably and also saves wear and tear on the camera and the batteries.  And printing out the images can be a bit costly by the time you add up the price of photo paper and inkjet cartridges.

Would I buy it again?  Probably, but might go up to the next model up.  However, it does all the things I wanted it to do and I probably would never give up on 35MM format entirely anyhow.<br><br>
