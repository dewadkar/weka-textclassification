            I currently possess a Rodeo LS and have found it to be a relatively good vehicle overall due to its reliability, but it is really just another SUV.
 
Exterior
The outside of the Rodeo has undergone few cosmetic changes, which lends itself to a symbol of a developed standard;  body side molding is contoured to merge into the styling.
 
Interior
The leather seats are not of a spectacular grade, and do not offer plush comfort as I have found in other SUVs at this price.  The rear seats are especially uncomfortable, even for the short trips, I realize now it was quite unnecessary to have purchased the option of a fold-down television installed into the roof of the Rodeo due to the fact that the only people who will sit in the back seat will probably be children, and I don't see any in my future.  
I purchased the leather seat option, because the choices of cloth seats were extremely ugly.
The controls in the dashboard are laid out in a basic method, not hinting upon much creativity, but the functions are easy to find.
Lights are extremely dim and misplaced in the Rodeo, as I have found it difficult to even read a map at a dark rest stop.
The standard sound system offers a muffled and rattled listening experience.  CDs sound much better played out of a boombox.  The radio tuner works exceptionally well, pulling in many weak stations.

Engine
The Rodeo eats gas.  A power mode is available for those moments when you need a little more ummph.  I have found this function useful if I am feeling particularly good and want to burn off a few gallons of gas needlessly.  Well this is an SUV and I guess I am bound by rule number one when driving one, keep on burning the fuel and quickly I might add.  There is plenty of power under the hood of the Rodeo, but be careful when cornering, as I have almost rolled my Rodeo on numerous occasions when I was only travelling around 35mph.

Overall
The Rodeo is a fun vehicle to drive, but in the long run requires plenty of monetary attention to keep it happy.  Monetary in the sense that with gas prices being as high as they are, hovering slightly around $2 a gallon, and the Rodeo only achieving 14-17 mpg;  it is hard to keep the Rodeo on the road long before having to make another stop at a gas station along the way.<br><br>
