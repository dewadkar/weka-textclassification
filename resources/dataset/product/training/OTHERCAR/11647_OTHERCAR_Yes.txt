            This car has everything, the attention to detail is impeccable. The service staff at the dealership is amazing, take the car in to get the tires changed and they wash your car! FOR FREE!

Let's start with the seats. The seats have been specially designed by a chiropractor. Don't expect to sink 3 feet into your seat, instead expect an amazing amount of support from a soft but firm seat that perfectly fits your back. The seat moves in about 20 different ways. Up, down, forward, back, you can individually move the front and back of the seat so you can technically sit at a strange angle, the back reclines, the top of the back curves forward and back, the headrest is electronic, you can adjust the lumbar support, and its heated (in the front)!

The back seat is a 3 person bench, but optimal comfort is reached with only 1 or 2. The middle "seat" is just kind of a hump, and all who have sat there have not been very happy. But the two side seats are also very comfortable, though leg room can be at a bit of a premium with a couple of tall people in there.

The motor should be why you buy this car, it is amazing. No matter what speed or what RPM you can be assured that as soon as you put the hammer down, this baby will go! That's what 282hp will do for you. But this comes at a price, and the price is gas. The gas mileage is not too good, at about 12L/100km in the city and 8L/100km on the highway (sorry, i dont know what the MPG is). Though one trip in the car and you will totally forget about how much this trip is costing you because it is SO much fun!

The handling is smooth as butter and the thing rides like it's on air. The only problem i have is that the steering feels a bit "slow" at times, but it just takes getting used to. All of the pedals are very responsive but the clutch is somewhat difficult to get used to, the friction point is very early and the room for error is not very big, but once you get used to it, you will swear by it. As i said, the attention to detail is great, our car even has a heated steering wheel, yes, a heated steering wheel!

The onboard computer is also really handy, it can tell you your gas mileage, the temperature, the distance left to destination (provided you put the starting distance in) and your ETA, the temperature outside, there's a stopwatch, you can also make the thing beep 15 seconds from the hour to remind you to switch stations to a news program. It's crazy!

The sounds system is also great, our car has 8 speakers that make an awesome sound when cranked up!

The car itself looks great too, the lines are so sleek and it is pretty low to the ground. This can also be a bad thing, watch out when driving around because it is lower than most cars you will drive so things you could drive over will now hit your car and possibly cause damage.

The only complaint i have is the cup holders, they are very flimsy and too small (apparently Germans have never heard of Tim Hortons!) and the ones in the back are even worse - one of them is already broken.

All in all though, this car is great and is a blast to drive - and it looks great!
