             Well what can I say I purchased a 99 grand voyager for $17,900 It has the driver side sliding door built in car seats. I love the built in car seats very convenient. I don't like the dual air bag because you cant turn the passenger air bag off. I and most people buy mini vans because we have children so my kids cant sit in the front seat til they are twelve? I believe the price is reasonable the 3.3 engine has enough power. The ride is very nice. If buying a mini van i would make sure it has dual sliding doors very convenient. The gas mileage is about 22mpg highway I hope you enjoy the mini van you choose I give the grand voyager an A for all around value<br><br>
