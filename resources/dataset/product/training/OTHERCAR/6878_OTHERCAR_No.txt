            I bought a Hyundai 99' Elantra in Nov. 98.  This car has given me nothing but problems.  The first winter I bought it, the car would not start in the cold and snow.  

Now, almost two years later, the problems have only gotten worse.  The car will not accelerate when I step on the gas.  The RPMs go up and down even though I don't step on the gas or brake.  The car shuts off at stop lights and stop signs.  It shakes and makes noises as soon as I turn it on.  I have taken the car to the dealer for repairs four times and they still have not resolved the problem.  The car will work okay for about a month or two and then its the same thing all over again.  When I drive in the rain the car will not move.  I step on the gas and it goes nowhere.  

I never knew that buying a brand new car would be such a curse.  That was the whole reason why I bought this car, because I didn't want to be bothered with repairs all the time.  My old 10-year old car runs better than the-piece-of-junk-Elantra I bought.  This car has given me so many headaches and it hurts me to think that I'm still paying for it every month and it's not even worth a penny. 

 I do not recommend this car to anyone looking to buy.  I hate my car.  I would trade it in, but who would buy it!!!!!???? I would buy a different Hyundai, but why should I trust them again????!!!!  I have just had it with the car and with that it would just be out of my life!!!!!<br><br>
