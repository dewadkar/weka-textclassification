            I purchased my 2000 Nubira Wagon (CDX) in February.  Since then I have put over 6000 enjoyable, trouble free miles on it with no problems whatsoever.  

The car handles well and is fun to drive.  While it is not the quickest car I've ever driven on takeoff, it will cruise at interstate speeds and above quite comfortably.  In my opinion it is very comfortable for a car in it's size class.  It has a lot of cargo space with the back seats folded down.

The Nubira has an overall feel of quality and craftsmanship, and the CDX model is fully loaded with options like leather interior, sun-roof, and AM/FM Cassete &amp; CD Player.

My wife loves to use it to buy groceries because of the ease of loading them into the rear hatch instead of having to sit them over into the trunk of a regular car.

Overall I don't think you will be disappointed if you buy a Daewoo...I certainly have not been.
