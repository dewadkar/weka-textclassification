            I was always a Chevy fan. Had probably about 10 of them. Never had a bad one.  The last one I owned was a Caprice.  It lasted me 10 yrs.  It was about time I got a new car.  I had researched a lot of cars. I never heard of the Kia until I went to the local mall and they had two on display-the 4 x 4 and a Sephia.  I then went to my local dealer and took a test drive.
It was the best car I had ever driven. It handled well on the highway. I was very impressed with the 24hr bumper to bumper service plan. After I bought the new jade green Sephia 2000 I was called by the dealer to see if I was satisfied or if there were any problems that had to be resolved. The problems were very minor which were taken care of right away.  In the past I have had problems with new cars and they have kept the car for sometimes up to 3 days. Not so with the Kia. They fix it right away.
And they make sure you have a rental car. I would recommend the Kia to anyone.  It is not as small as you think it is. The trunk is quite large.
So if you are looking into a new or used car-check out the Kia. You will be surprised.  I have all the features of the other brands with less money.  And the best part is they don't try to push you to buy the car.
There was absolutely no pressure like other dealers.  I understand this is the policy that Kia has.<br><br>
