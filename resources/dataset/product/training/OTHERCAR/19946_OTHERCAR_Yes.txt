            I bought a 1994 VW Passat two years ago and this car has turned out to be a living nightmare.  It's sporty good looks and roominess can't make up for the electrical problems, the fuel line problems, the alternator breaking and thousands of dollars in repairs - and the car has not even reached 60,000 miles yet!

I am reluctant to buy a volkswagen ever again - and my first car was a VW bug :-(.  I am sad about my beautiful car not living up to my expectations of having reliable transportation.
