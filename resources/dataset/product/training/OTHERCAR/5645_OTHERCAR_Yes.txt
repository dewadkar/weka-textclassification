            Last year I bought a Z3 and I couldn't be more pleased with it.  The car has been through everything and it handled fine in all type of situations.  Even though I don't like to drive it around in the snow and rain that much, I had to a few times.  don't get me wrong it drives fine in both conditions, but it is mainly my summer car.  You know baby blue convertable BMW really gets the girls.  You have to keep it in good condition and looking nice so I don't want to take the risk since I haven't totally paid it off yet.  For a 4 cylinder the car has some power to it.  I was surprised when I first test drove it!  I couldn't believe the power and comfort of this car.  It handled perferct without a problem in the world.  Which is the main reason why I bought it.  Some of the other cars I was looking at didn't handle that well and wasn't performing to my standards.  So to everyone out there that happens to read this, I hope you like my review of the amazing Z3.  I would definitly recommend this car to you.  If you don't believe me then who are you going to believe?  Someone that doesn't actually own one and writes about it, or someone that owns one and knows what the car actually functions like?  I'll just leave that one up to you!<br><br>
