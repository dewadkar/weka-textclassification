            At the time of writing this, I'm a potential owner of a 2000 Honda Odyssey 2000 EX model. It's been about a month since I placed my order with an auto broker for the MSRP (maximum selling retail price) and the wait is worth it for this well designed minivan.

The Odyssey comes in 2 models, LX and EX. The EX offers everything of the LX plus auto dual-sliding doors, power driver's seat etc. For more info, check out www.edmunds.com or www.honda2000.com . The 2000 model is not very different from the 1999 model except for an additional color choice in white and an optional navigation system (costs about $2000). 

We test drove a Toyota Sienna, a Dodge Grand Caravan and the Honda Odyssey. Dodge has traditionally been the leader in the minivan segment but reliability is a concern here. The Toyota sienna rode well, had a quiet engine but leg room at the back wasn't enough for us to consider it. We like to go outdoors carrying camping equipment, bikes etc. and the Odyssey's 3rd row magic seat (folds to create more cargo room - can also be turned around to form a tailgate seat)will come in very handy for this.

I think the Odyssey is worth its value for the money - MSRP for the 2000 Odyssey EX is about $ 26,415 and it's hard to get one at the MSRP price too considering the popularity and high demand/low supply situation. For those who want to research more and view postings of owners or other folks regarding the odyssey, definitely check out the Town Hall section of www.edmunds.com and www.honda-acura.net. If you're willing to wait a couple of weeks (could be months too sometimes), you should be able to get a nice van in the Odyssey - you'll be glad you did.<br><br>
