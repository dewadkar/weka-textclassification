            I picked-up this car from iMotors.com (which I also recommend).  They gave it a tune-up, oil change, cleaned it inside and out and even put two new tires on it at no extra charge.  

This car really moves.  The Gran Sport comes with a Grand Touring Suspension, A/C, Power Locks and windows, Power Mirrors, rear window de-fogger, and 16-inch alloy wheels as standard. Not to mention a 4-speed automatic and ABS brakes. It has good torque and power, just enough for this size vehicle.  (My last car was a Chevette, which made me appreciate the difference even more...).  I get 27mpg from the 3.1 Liter V6.  The only problem I had was with the automatic door locks but they were covered under the warranty.  

I can only nit-pick on the minus side:  The visor tends to get in my way when I want to put it to the side.  That's really about it.  It's black with silver cladding and looks sharp.  

UPDATE 8-1-2001: I've had this car for about a year and a half now and at 83,000 miles it still runs great.  The engine, transmission and even the brakes are still smooth and quiet.

UPDATE 3-7-2002:  Up to 87,000 miles.  There was a design improvement on the parking brake that I had replaced a year earlier.  Also, if you get the four-door, the door jamb switches are re-designed and should be replaced.  You'll know it if your dome light never seems to go out....  Other than that, just normal wear and tear.  Can't say enough good things about the engine.  

I've only had minor repairs such as the plastic blower motor cover in the engine compartment warping and allowing water to seep into the passenger compartment.  It was a $300 repair, but it's worth it, especially if you park outside.

One other minus is that you practically have to remove the rear seat to get at the back speakers.  Also in the front, the 4x6 opening can be made to accommodate larger speakers.  (Try Crutchfield.com for adapters).  

When I installed my 6 x 9 speakers, I got around having to remove the back seat by going into the trunk instead and using pliers to unscrew the bolts holding the factory speakers and was successful in removing them that way.  I then used some #4 screws nuts and lock washers to install some new speakers.  AND IT WORKS!  So I hope that helps anyone balking at putting new rear speakers in.

I only know of one recall on this car that has to do with the starter and the ignition switch.  You can call a GM dealer to repair it at no cost.  They will install a relay so that your ignition switch won't be damaged in case the starter malfunctions.

One other minus - This particular car's ABS light tends to come on sometimes and will re-set when the steering wheel is tilted all the way to the top and then lowered to your desired position.

Call Buick at 1-800-521-7300.  You can also go to the NHTSA website for recall information at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/.
