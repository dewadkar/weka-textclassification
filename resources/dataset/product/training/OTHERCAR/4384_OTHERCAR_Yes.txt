            We bought our Sunbird when it was a year old.  It had 20,000 miles.  We have put 170,000 miles on it.  We drove it from Louisiana to Kansas, Kansas to Louisiana, Louisiana to Kansas, Kansas to oklahoma to Kansas, Kansas to Georgia to Louisiana to Georgia to Louisiana to Georgia to Louisiana.  We did a lot of moving! The car spent cold, cold mid-west winters, 100+ degree Louisiana summers, and everything in between.  Driven hard at 75-85 miles per hour on expressways, to major populated city streets with lots of stopping and starting.  It still runs very well.

We did not, I hate to say, pay as much attention to its needs as we should have.  Oil was neglected, etc.  And it still sits in our garage, ready to take us to gymnastics tomorrow.

The only things that are wrong with it are as follows:  some of the parts, while being very affordable, must be bought or ordered from the manufacturer; some things are hard to get to but still are managable; not much leg room for backseaters.

My hubby did nearly everything on this car.  He changed the oil, break pads, alternator (though he had to enlist a friend to help manuever it out), you name it.

This car was great when it was just the two of us.  We packed our lives in it many times to move.  Our cat, our new computer, many pounds of suitcases.  A wonderful car for a couple with no children, or a couple with one or two children, even if they are both in carseats.  We currently have two in car seats.  But as they are getting bigger, we need more room.  Mine had a tendancy to overheat, as do most Pontiacs we have been in contact with.  You just rig the fan to blow all the time, remove your thermostat in the summer, and yuo are okay.  Trust me.  We are in September now and it is 112 at 5pm and it does well.

A college student or high school student would be great as an owner of this car.  Anti-lock breaks are a big plus.  More trunk space than you would expect.  And not bad looking.

Overall, we have been very pleased with this car.  It kept us save and on the move for 8 years.<br><br>
