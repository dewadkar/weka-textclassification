            OK, I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't looking forward to joining the SUV stampede.  When we discovered we were having a happy addition to the family, I knew something was going to change in the garage.  We owned to fun convertibles: Jeep Wrangler and a BMW, one was going to get the hook. Some might say I was already in the SUV stampede with a Wrangler and the only thing I'll concede is it's an SuV (not a lot of utility, trust me).

After a review of finances, the beemer got placed on waivers.  Off to dealerships to run the gamut of SUV's we went.  We drove seven different models and the RX300 crossed the finish line uncontested.

The first thing that struck me about the RX300 was it's interior.  It's overall layout, fit, finish and ergonomics.  The seats are a pleasure to ride in and instrumentation is outstanding.  The center console is well placed so that the radio is easy to adjust.  The CD player is in a convenient location in the glove box, not in the bowels of the vehicle. The sound system provides performance par excellence.  The back seats are as roomy and comfortable as the fronts seats, a rarity in many vehicles.  The back seats can fold flat for handy storage or in the upright position, can be leaned back for snoozing in the second row.  That is something that a lot of others in this class were conspicuously missing. 

Ride?  This is what shocked me the most.  I couldn't believe how well this vehicle rode.  It's handling is not that far removed from some larger sports sedans.  It's power and acceleration is without peer in it's class.  This vehicle will perform with any SUV in total road performance (acceleration, ride, handling, top speed).

OK, now you have to hear me complain:
1. The trip timer resets itself every time you turn the key off.  What? I'm supposed to leave it running while getting gas? 
2. The glove box door is a little too hard to shut for my liking.
3. The RX300 has a safety feature where you can't take it out of park unless you depress the brake. That's nice, but the dealership should tell you these things!  I arm wrestled this vehicle more than once.

Who shouldn't buy this vehicle:  Anyone desiring to do serious off-roading.  I don't care if you buy the 4 wheel drive package, it's not made for heavy duty four-wheeling.  DO NOT take one of these into Jeep Cherokee territory, unless you have a penchant for repair/towing bills.
