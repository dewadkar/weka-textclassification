            We just purchased a new Grand Caravan SE Sport.  We looked at the Ford Windstar and the Mazda MPV.  We chose the Grand Caravan over the Ford because of price and a smoother drive.  The choice over the Mazda MPV was mainly due to the additional room.  We wanted the Tow Package which has several engine modifications and we also wanted the leather seats.  This van has every option available except for the traction control and AWD.  The 3.8 engine has a lot of power but lowers the MPG in the city from 17 to 18.  We are still breaking the vehicle in and have not seen this MPG range as of yet. We are getting about 14.8 in the city.  

There is plenty of room for multiple car seats and it is easy to move around when dealing with children.  We got the vehicle for $200 over invoice, then took a $3000 rebate off this price.  I would strongly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for plenty of room, a good vehicle to road-trip in, and likes a smooth ride.<br><br>
