            I purchased my 1992 Chevrolet Lumina in June of 1992 as a program car with approximately 24,000 miles on it.  It has a 3.1 6 cylinder engine, air conditioning, power brakes, power windows.  I was able to purchase it for about $12,300 which I saved a few thousand over buying the same model of car with no miles on it.

I have had regular maintenance on it, oil changes about every 3,000 miles, and had regular tuneups about every 30,000 miles.  It's been a very good reliable car, mostly trouble-free.  (Of course, any car that you keep long enough will have parts that will wear out and have to be replaced.)  It gets 31 miles per gallon on the highway, and uses regular unleaded gas.  It is very comfortable to ride in.

It now has over 116,000 miles on it, and still going strong.  The starter was replaced at about 75,000.  The alternator was replaced at 93,000 miles.  Earlier this year (March 2000) something called the torque-kill switch was replaced on the transmission (which cost around $260 including labor to replace).  It is a great car.  I have been very pleased with it, and still expect to get a lot of good miles on it yet.  It still runs very well.  My insurance agent estimated the book value on this car would still be around $4,000.  I would definitely recommend a Chevrolet Lumina to my friends and family.
