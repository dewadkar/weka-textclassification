            <b>Looking for a car that I could put a gang of miles on traveling back and forth to work, I found Saturn to offer the most for the buck back in 1995.</b>


<b>The Saturn SL I Own</b>
<b>*</b> Manual Transmission-automatic transmission was not an option with the base model that I own. 
<b>*</b> A/C- Why would anyone <i>not</i> have it?
<b>*</b> AM/FM Cassette
That's it! There isn't much available to cheapskates like me!

<b>Why I Would Purchase Again</b>
<b>*</b> Dependability- Over 80,000 miles without any breakdowns or repairs, with the exception of regular maintenance.

<b>*</b> With its all plastic body (with the exception of the hood, roof and trunk) there isn't much need to pamper the exterior. Minor scratches haven't turned into rust spots and the finish still looks great. A light waxing twice a year is sufficient to maintain its brilliant shine.

<b>*</b>Fuel Economy- Approximately 38 MPG highway and 26 City.

<b>What I Dislike</b>
<b>*</b>The heat takes what seems like forever in the coldest months. I live in the Northeast and still hate the snow and cold. On the coldest days I could travel 3 miles before I feel a heat difference.

<b>*</b> Screwy wiper system that takes the blade clear off the side of the windshield causing the blade rub the molding and reducing the life of the refill. This makes me nuts! Didn't anyone see this when they were designing this car?

<b>*</b> Noise, noise and more noise. As my car gets older every sound seems to get amplified every day. One day I'll hear something rattling in the back and the next something on the right chattering. I never find the source. It seems, as I get closer to finding it, it hears me and moves to the other side.

<b>*</b> You wouldn't want to travel more than a few hundred miles sitting in the back seat, my kids do on occasion, and I feel for them. I really do. ;)

<b>Customer Service</b>
Since there was no haggling on the price, salespeople weren't so pushy at Saturn. The few dealings I had with the dealership were related to parts and service and found them to be pleasant. One problem I did have was with the Financial Manager. I complained to Saturn in Tennessee and it was answered to my liking with a personal letter.
 
<b>Overall</b>
What I was looking for was a reliable car capable of providing transportation without the worry of breakdown between home and work, which is quite desolate. I didn't want to spend a ton of money, still making payments while I was towing it to the junkyard.
Let's face it, the Saturn SL is not a fancy car but then again it's not supposed to be. It is an economical ride, that's it. 
The complaints about the car are, in my opinion, minor compared to major repairs. If you're looking for a dependable used car, then Saturn may be what you are looking for. If you're looking for a luxury car with all the bells and whistles then look elsewhere. The only bells and whistles you'll get here are the noises I spoke of earlier.
