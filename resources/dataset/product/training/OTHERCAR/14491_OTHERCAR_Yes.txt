            We bought our Sonata because I loved the body style,and it seemed to have more features that other cars in its price range.I had never thought about buying a Hyundai,but the dealer showed us this car and I loved the body style.It really does have the style of an expensive car.

We bought our Sonata when it was a year old and it had 20,000 miles on it.It is a lot of fun to drive,is very comfortable and has the best warranty out there.The only problems we have had is with the transmission,which has been replaced twice.Thank goodness it is covered on the warranty!The other thing I dont like is the paint seems to flake off.Just the other day there was a leaf laying on the door,I went to pick it off and it took the paint off with it in the shape of the leaf!Luckilly,even the paint job is covered with the warranty,so I will soon be taking it in for that.

If you want a good family car that looks and feels like a more expensive car,then the Hyundai Sonata is for you.<br><br>
