            When my husband and I found out we would be adding a new little member to our family we began car shopping.  We both thought we needed a safer vehicle that would make traveling easier.  We did more than our share of homework.  We consulted Consumer Reports, online reviews, friends, and we test drove several different models of minivans.  When we drove the Dodge Caravan and looked at the value we were getting for the money, we decided it was the best choice.

There are so many things I love about the Caravan.  Most importantly, I feel safe driving in our minivan with our baby in the back seat.  We love being able to take friends and out-of-town guests along with us, and it's so comfortable.  Of course, as with any vehicle, there are a few things I would change if I could.  We had power windows and doors installed as an &quot;after factory&quot; option and they haven't quite lived up to our expectations.  The windows rattle every time I close the door.  It's difficult climbing into the back seat with the infant seat in place, and last but not least, it doesn't get the greatest gas mileage, but it's not as bad as SUVs.

Overall, I would definitely purchase this vehicle again.
