            I bought a 1992 Dodge Spirit in 8/92.  It was a dealer program car and had 17,000 miles and I paid only $9600 for it.  Now, 8 years later, it has 260,000 miles and is still on the original engine.  

I have had very few problems with this car mechanically and just replaced the original transmission at 185,000 miles.  I have replaced the head gasket a couple of times over the years, a water pump, a fuel pump, and other normal repairs you would expect after 150,000 miles. 

I put on average 100 miles a day on this car with mostly interstate driving and can get about 25 miles to the gallon.  It has been a very reliable car and I am about to hand it over to my 15 year old son to learn how to drive.  I have been very happy with this car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice family car with a low maintenance cost and good gas mileage.  

My car has the 2.4L 4-cyl engine. This car has a smooth ride and roomy interior with a nice size trunk.  My family of 5 has made many trips in this vehicle over the years and I am looking to purchase for myself a newer model of the same car again.  <br><br>
