            I bought a 2000 Silverado extended cab Z-71 because i wanted a new truck, and it is the best one available. Ford and Dodge gas burners are gas hogs, and do not have the strong resale of the Chevy.
The ride and drive of a Chevrolet are the best I have ever seen in a truck. I have the bucket seats, the larger V-8, and an automatic transmission. I have averaged over 16mpg, and this is with less than one thousand miles on the truck. I did not think I wanted the third door, but I really like the access it gives me to the rear part of the cab. I don't have any children, or I would have waited for the fourth door option to come out. I have had several trucks with the 454 engine, but I feel that this one will tow as well as any of them.
The only things that I do not like are the price, and the payments. The sticker price was over $31,500 although I did not pay that much. Due to its strong resale, GM will offer a good deal on a lease. I have wanted one of these for a long time, and plan to keep it a pretty good while.  This is why I decided to purchase the truck. One thing I have read about in a truck magazine is the interior door handles. The plastic they are made of does not feel very sturdy. This may simply be due to the new material they are made of. They used to be made of a hard plastic, and the new plastic is softer, so I am probably just used to that. That is the only thing that I can figure that the magazine was referring to.
I have seen used extended cab Z-71 trucks with 75,000 miles selling for close to $20,000 so I thought a new one would be a good deal with such low depreciation. If someone can put that many miles on in a couple of years, and only lose about three thousand per year, that seems pretty good to me.
I have heard complaints of the former body style having weak brakes in relation to the size and weight of the truck. Especially if you tow a trailer that does not have its own brakes. (Several of my friends are farmers, and cotton trailers and fertilizer buggies are not equipped with brakes.) This problem was solved with the new truck. The four wheel disc, with anti-lock stop quickly and in a straight line. The feel on rough pavement when the anti-lock keeps the rear wheels from locking feels a little funny at first, but it does help you stop. All the controls are easy to reach, and easily understood. I like the idea of the automatic lights. I have seen many people with DRL equipped vehicles forget to turn on their lights after dark. With this truck, they come on automatically. The only time you really need to use the switch is when it is raining, but not too dark. The seats are fantastic. I had a 1990 454SS truck with buckets, but these new ones put those to shame. I have not driven a regular cab Silverado, but everyone I have seen driving one and talked to says they are more roomy than the old body style trucks. 
Anyone who wants a well-built, comfortable, roomy truck should look at the Silverado. I admit that I am a Chevy man. I think that Ford and Dodge make a good truck, but they cannot compare to the new Chevy. A friend of mine traded his 1993 GMC for a new 1998 Ford, and he told me the Ford uses about $100 more gas a month. Another friend has a 1997 Dodge, and he admits that it likes gas a whole lot. The truck is also very quiet. The only noise I hear is on the interstate at about 65 to 70 mph. This is not the fault of the truck. It is my booster antenna for my cell phone.
I have highly recommended the truck to everyone I have talked to about it.<br><br>
