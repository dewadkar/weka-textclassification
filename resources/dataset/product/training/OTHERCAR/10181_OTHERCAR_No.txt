            When the word &quot;off road&quot; is mentioned in a SUV commercial, they show their product going through mud and other horendous situations. The truth is that a big portion of today's SUV are nothing more than just trendy family vans or confused cars.

Let's take the Lexus RX300. This has got to be the most expensive piece of monkey feces. I've ever test driven. Sure it has a smooth ride, comfortable leather seats and a lot of extra creature comfort but ask yourself; &quot;Why am I buying this vehicle for?&quot;. Do you have a family? kids? Then go buy a van or a car and save yourself some money.

This vehicle did great on the road but when it came to offroad, I thought to myself; &quot;For a price of at least $50,000, I could've bought two Jeep Cherokee Sport and would've been able to go off the road easily.&quot; .

I HATE (yes and I mean HATE) the generic independent suspension this confused car has. Any real offroader will tell you that this does not cut it off road. Furhtermore, this vehicle only has part time fourwheel drive and it's &quot;automatic&quot;. Meaning, you can't control the traction when you need it most. 

Have you ever seen a &quot;Lexus Offroad Jamboree?&quot;. Heck no. If you want a real sport utility vehicle, go with the original, Jeep. They have Offroad Jamborees, where all types of Jeeps from CJ, Wrangler to the very luxurious Grand Cherokee go offroading.

If you're a wealthy, socially conscious, balding, over-weight, testosterone deprived kind of person then this is for you. Real off roaders, I don't need to tell you to buy a Jeep.<br><br>
