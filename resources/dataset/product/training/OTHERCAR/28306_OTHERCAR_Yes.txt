            I've had great experiences with Canons, so naturally, when it came time to buy myself a digital camera, that's where I looked.  I wanted a small camera, something that would fit in my small purse, so that I could take it anywhere and take pictures anytime.  I have not been disappointed!  I've taken hundreds of pictures in the 6 months I've had this camera and they've turned out great. 

When I share the pictures with friends and family, they are surprised at how good the pictures look.  They're crisp, focused, and the lighting is just right.  I've taken pictures in really dark restaurants (so dark that I had to use the viewfinder rather than the screen to make sure I was aiming the camera in the right place), but if you look at the photo, you'd think we were in a well-lit place! 

While some complain that the flash is too weak, I find that it's just right; a little strong at times, even.  If you view the photo on the camera's LCD screen, it may look too dark or bright, but once you view it on a computer, it looks just fine.  I've gotten pictures from friends with digital cameras made by other companies, and the quality isn't as good.  

The camera has nice features, such as macro, manual (so you can adjust the shutter time, etc), and my favorite, movie mode.  I've recorded a couple of movies, like fireworks and musical performances, with my camera and it has turned out surprisingly well.  Plus, it has 9-point autofocus so it does a pretty good job focusing on what you want it to focus on, even if it's off-center.  As for the shutter lag, there is a little lag because the camera is focusing on the subject.  That can easily be taken care of by focusing ahead of time by pressing down partway on the shutter (something most cameras allow you to do). 

I've used this camera for a long time, but every once in a while, I'm still surprised at how great it is.  All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase.  If you're going to get a digital camera, don't go cheap or gimmicky.  Spend a little more and get a quality camera.
