            I bought this car because I get SUV features without feeling like I am driving a truck or a bus.  It is a but quirky and offbeat but I have always loved that about Subaru.  You can't beat the price it handles fantastic in any weather and living in the Northeast I see it all.  It gets great gas mileage.  Insurance rates are reasonable.  Reliability has been excellent.  This is my second Subaru, my first was still going strong at over 115k miles with no problems at all when I totaled it, and walked away without a scratch or even a bruise (love that airbag).  My sunglasses were in my front coat pocket and were not even bent!  I recommend this car highly to almost everyone.  The only complaint I have about it is the seat warmers are more like bun burners, they run super hot.  Other than that it is such a great car.<br><br>
