            It is a fact; this car is a Maxima, with a few simple revisions.  for instance it has a 227 HP engine, thats 5 more hp than the Maxima.  It has the Bose stero, same as the Maxima, but i will get into specifics later.  The I30 has always been an equality of Nissan's Maxima, but always looked better.  The I30 is goregous, those rims, that clock that represents Infinity, the nice leather, and much more, but is it worth the extra money than the Maxima?

Acceleration, preformance:  I am a big fan of Japanesse automobiles, and have always looked up to Infinity.  The way this car accelerates is nice and smooth, it can be punchy, but it depends on the driver, ususally a teen driver would bring the sporty side out while driving around town, while an older driver would show the car's swift elegant style of driving.  What is amazing is that this car is very quiet, and much quieter than the Maxima SE,  Although this car has five more HP than the Maxima, it still falls short of being a sport sedan, this is indeed a luxury sedan, with a sporty side, but like I said, it is up to you to point it out.

Ride, Comfort: This car is quiet, yet you might not feel the speed, you might creep into the high 80s before you notice, that can be a good thing, OR a bad thing; but either way, keep your eyes on the speedometer.  The leather is think and smooth, and better quality of the Acura's cheap thin leather.  This car rides like a Lincoln Town Car, with a slight sportier appeal.

Sound System, audio:  With the same system as offered as an option on the Nissan Maxima,  it has top quality speakers that produce a great sound, made by Bose, one of the most respected audio companys.  If you are looking to replace the Head unit, you have a limited chose as it is not standard size, it is shaped like a square, not a rectangle.  With a CD player and cassette on the same unit.  A cd-changer can be aquired if opted for, and I hear that they are of top quality as well.  

Reliability Prediction:  I can't give a fair epinion on this catagory, so i will make a prediction.  As the way the car drives, and if taken car as well as it should with regular matinance, oil changes, etc...  It should last a good 150,000 miles, and at 180k before the car would completely die, as I said this is a prediction, and it may fall short, or may surpass,  but under regular conditions this is what I would say.  You can drive this car as a daily driver,  you shouldnt lock this one in the garage all year.

Wisky

(note: i have NOTHING agenst the Nissan Maxima, in fact i like the car, i just think it should be a totally different car than Infinity's midrange luxuruy sedan, it is a matter of perspective; is the Maxima too good for the price, or is the I30 too expensive for the package)
