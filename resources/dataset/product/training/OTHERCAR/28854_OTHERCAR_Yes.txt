            While working for a Real estate agency, I advised the purchase of the DC210 digital camera.  We found it for almost half the retail price from an E-business.  This camera's purpose was to replace regular film to cut down on costs.  The pictures were beautiful.  I was uncertain of the camera's potential, but it turned out really nice photos.  The interface from the camera to the computer was very simple to understand and included both adobe and kodak software.  It might be too simple for some though. Photos printed out very nicely on photo paper, and we had the option to put 1 to 8 photos on a page.  In addition the user interface on the camera itself is great.  It includes various modes and a simple options menu.  Both small businesses and personal users can benefit from this camera.  IT's price and performance makes this a very good buy.  <br><br>
