            I love everything about my 4-Runner... except for the payments and the options I did not get.

Barely out of college, I found myself a deer in the headlights of a slick Toyota salesman. I was blinded by the beauty of the 4-Runner that I would put up less than I fight for in negations just minutes after the test drive. I nodded &quot;Uh-huh&quot;, signed my name, and drove away with my brand-new liability... and I have loved every minute.

Under normal conditions, the 4-Runner drives like a car. In the snow and mud, it provides enough confidence to get you where you need to go. I enjoy the higher ride and the &quot;go anywhere&quot; feel I get from it. I have had no problems with winter weather in my the 4-Runner, though I admit that in 4WD it handles much more like a tractor than a car... in a good way. As the driver I have always been comfortable in the cockpit and the only passenger complaint was from a sixth passenger, coiled in the rear-cargo area. The cargo area, equipped with a storage compartment, cargo net and tie-downs, has served me well for most anything I have needed to haul. The rear seats fold down to allow even more room. 

The down-side of the 4-Runner is the price. The price is a bit high, but will payoff as a long-lasting vehicle. Also, I did not get some of the options I would have enjoyed, such as moon-roof, leather, cd player, etc.

I would recommend the 4-Runner to anyone enjoys the freedom-to-roam it provides. If you are like me, your 4-Runner + a few inches of fresh snow or mud = a good time to be had.
