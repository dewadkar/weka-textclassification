                    I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.
       
      There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

      The Toyota Camry is one vehicle that I don't mind at all giving a raving review from the standpoint of suspension. I have worked on many Camry's, since it is a very popular car in the area where I live. I have the utmost respect for the engineers who designed this suspension. 

    The Camry suspension has gone for the most part unchanged for many years, probably because nobody complains and there hasn't been any need for a re-design. It is a fully adjustable independant suspension, which aids in comfort as well as handling. It is nothing fancy, just rock solid Macpherson strut design on all 4 corners.

     The tie rods as well as the ball joints, though not factory greasable holds up very well, as evidenced by the fact I have seen a few with over a quarter of a million miles on them and there has been no need of replacement due to wear out. I don't know what kind of metal they use in their construction, but it is very strong and very well thought out.

    This car for some reason, obviously the strength and design, holds it's alignment very well. I have many customers who routinely get their alignment checked faithfully once a year, and many of them require only a check, not a re-align. I live in upper Michigan and the roads are very pot hole filled due to long winters of freezing/ thawing constantly, so for a car to hold it's alignment up here is saying a lot.
    
    The coil springs hold up very well also. In checking ride height spec's before alignments the camry holds its ride height over the years while some other cars sag, and ride very low due to weak springs.

      The factory allows some camber adjustment on front and a little on the rear also, but more importantly all 4 corners allow for toe adjustment, with a cam system on the rear so your alignment tech can dial it right in.

      The drive axles are also a strong point having never serviced a camry for a bad C.V. joint or a boot that ripped from bad workmanship.

     Over all, the Camry is top notch from underneath and you shouldn't have to worry much at all. Drive with confidence in the independant suspensions road holding capabilities, and when your grandkids inherit this car it will still be going strong.<br><br>
