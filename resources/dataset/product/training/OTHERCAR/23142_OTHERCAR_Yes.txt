            I bought the Fuji Finepix 401 from Amazon two months ago for two reasons.  a) As a designer I needed a digital camera that was compact enough to take everywhere for shots that I could use for print and on the web, and b) for holiday shots for a two week vacation in California.  With vital statistics including a 2x optical zoom, a docking cradle, (optional) 128mb Smartmedia memory, high quality movie function with sound, and a rechargeable battery - this was the camera that fit the bill!

When you first see the 401 the first thing you'll notice is it's looks - from the stylish sliding "on" switch to the 3 blue LED's, it's compact size through to the funky menu graphics, this unit oozes class.  It's true to say that it gets comments wherever you take it.

When you start using the camera it doesn&#146t take long to realise how easy it is to use.  The menus are wonderfully thought out, allowing you to crop and delete shots, change the resolution/brightness, movie size, with speed, and the hi-quality backlit screen lets you preview the pictures enough to make shot selection on the go, without having to download the lot. The camera also supports forced flash, no flash, auto flash, long exposure flash, and a close up mode.  Obviously not a selection for professional photographers, but more than enough for the &#147holiday snapper&#148 and I find all the settings more than adequate for use in hi-resolution print design.  The &#147crop&#148 feature is exceptionally useful, allowing areas of an image to be isolated, and the rest of the data deleted, so you can free up valuable memory space on the camera - -dead useful when I spotted Morgan Freeman at a distance, fired off 50 shots with the fast shutter mechanism, and then had to budget space the remaining week of the holiday.

All the flash modes work as expected, and are powerful enough.  The slow shutter flash setting, designed so you can get decent foreground and background visibility at night, is also adaptable so you can get those trendy &#147motion trails&#148 and light effects with creative camera and subject movement.  Great for random design images.  The close-up feature also does the trick, allowing for all the sharp pictures of flowers you&#146ll ever want!

The movie mode also fails to disappoint. Two resolutions are available, both of sufficient resolution to make out people/places etc.  The sound quality is also excellent.  My one complaint is the movie maximum time limit of two minutes.  On the advertising literature I was promised &#147Up to 90 minutes movie with sound on a 128mb card&#148.  Only when I received the camera did I find out that the 90 minutes was not consecutive, but broken up. Still, a minor complaint (although one I feel the advertising should pick up on).

Another useful feature for the holiday photographer is the &#147sound caption&#148 facility &#150 allowing you to record audio to a photograph.  Mostly used for reminding myself who lived where on the Hollywood house tour, it also came in handy for remembering my 6 digit hotel room number!

The battery life is great, the camera is rechargeable, made even easier with it&#146s USB recharge/photo download cradle, Smartmedia cards are nice and small, and there&#146s even a handy pocket for spares in the padded leather case.

Basically, I love this camera.
