            I went down and test drove all the cars that I had gotten information on. I was starting to get frustrated with the whole car experience. This was until I came upon the right car. I went to the Chevrolet Dealership and told them what kind of car I was looking for, a sporty, roomy, good mileage, and last but not least POWER. So many times you can find a car with three of the four requests but to find a car with all four, I started to think that I was in a dream and at any moment someone was going to wake me. 

After test driving this car, I was completely convinced that I had found the perfect car. Then came the hard part, convincing my husband. After all my ideal car may not be my husband's ideal car. I went home and started telling him all that I had found. I first started with the POWER issue. 

I finally was able to get him to go down for a test drive. After one mile he was convinced more than I was. We then proceeded to purchase the car with all the bells and whistles possible. The dealership and GMAC financing were just wonderful, but that's another review.
