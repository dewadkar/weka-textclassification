            I've owned my Neon for over 6 years (bought it brand new off the lot).  The first 4 years were great.  It got me through college.  After that 4 year mark, everything went wrong at once.
I've had to replace the 02 sensor twice and the electrical system is nutty.  The electric locks are tricky at times, too.  This problem was "fixed" a few years ago during a recall (unrelated) however it returned a few months ago.  Even if you hit unlock twice, one of the back doors does not unlock.  Sometimes when the car starts, the A/C does not come on.  You have to kill the ignition and re-start.  This usually works.  At random times, the gauges will either read nothing at all or will spin wildly and then read nothing.  Because of a leak in the trunk seal, water continually leaks into the rear lights.  Constantly replacing bulbs that blow because of the water.  This was a recall matter that was "fixed."  Again, did not solve the problem.  Car can smell musty after heavy rains because of this...water accumulates in the spare tire well.
