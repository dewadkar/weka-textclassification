            I love my jeep wrangler.  It rides great, it's a convertible, and it's fun to go playing in the mud.  I bought it on a whim.  I test drove it and loved it.  The payments are killing be but the fun I get out of it make it worthwhile.

I love to take it out in the mud and get it as dirty as I can.  Just last weekend we went four-wheeling and went up a straight up and down hill.  Made it about 1/4 of the way up, but was fun trying.

The only complaints I have are the low gas mileage, I only get 12 miles to a gallon; my oversize mud tires are very loud, and the dash controls go on and off.  Most all of my complaints will shortly be fixed hopefully by buying all-terrain tires with a less aggressive tread.  

Any suggestions on a good brand of tires for jeeps would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Kelley
