            I was in the market for a newer car. I was driving a 89 Accord, and It was to slow and to small... When  I went to the dealer I saw this beautiful gold maxima sitting there with my name all over it...

1993 with 40k totally loaded. I was pleasantly surprised to see the price was only 9,995. So I bought it. 

190 hp V6 manual transmission. Bose stereo, sunroof, I was in heaven! 

The 93 maxima, aka Madison, is unbelievably fast! It smokes! I love the power you get from every gear! I have ran it to about 100 mph, and it held strong. And the handling is incredible. Cursing around 60 degree turns at 50 with out any skidding! Im in love!!!!! If you are in the need of a good fast family car that is a good price, the 93 maxima is for you...

The only downside to the 93 maxima is the gas milage. Right now Im only getting around 19-20 mpg in city. So that could be a little better. But over all its a sweet ride<br><br>
