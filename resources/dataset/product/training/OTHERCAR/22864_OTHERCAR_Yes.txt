            I am one lucky guy! At the tender age of 27 I was handed the keys to my friends 1970 Miura S and told to take her for a spin. This little jont turned into a 6 hour drive! I didn't want to stop!
This car is actually very roomy inside. I am 6'1&quot; and had plenty of leg room, hip room, and head room. The only thing I found tough was trying to change lanes without being able to see behind me. The rear view is terrible. Right behind your head is the transverse 12 cylinder engine! More on that in a bit.
The view from the front is great! You can see the sides and front wonderfully. As you gaze out the front your sight is blocked only by a little bit from the wheel humps. It gives you the effect of driving the bat mobile!
The engine roars out at 375 HP at 7000 rpms. The engine uses 40 series side draft weber carbs, 6 of them. There are no belts to be found, it's all gear driven.
Anyways, the drive was awesome! This car gets up and goes! Shifting is a bit tight going through the metal shift gate but after a while you get to master it. My right ankle was a bit stiff with keeping the gas pedal on the floor and all. Would I ever buy this car? Damn straight I would!<br><br>
