            I am one of those incredibly lucky individuals who loves their car.  It's sick really.  I get all up in my friends faces for the teensiest things that I believe can in some way damage my beautiful car.  &quot;Did you touch my window?!  Then why is there a handprint there?&quot;  &quot;Did you manually unlock your door?!  JUST WAIT!!! I'll do it for you.  Manually doing it can mess it up!!&quot;  &quot;Make sure you got all the sand off your shoes.&quot;  My friends, many times fed up with my attitude, are just more than likely incredibly jealous of my good fortune.

For my highschool graduation present, my parents bought me a BEATUIFUL cherry red, 1998 Grand Cherokee Laredo.  There was approximately 42,500 miles on it.  But who cares?  This thing was my baby.  What this sucker had could in no way be topped. 

THE INSIDE
has AUTOMATIC EVERYTHING including WINDOWS, MIRRORS, LIGHTS and DOORS. Perhaps most importantly, it had AUTOMATIC SEAT ADJUSTMENTS.  When I first got my Laredo, I sat inside it just content moving my seat up and down, forward and back, or blowing it up so that it was more cushiony. (YES! It does that!)  It even had the ability to change radio stations, tracks on your CD PLAYER, or fast forward and rewind TAPES, just by tapping a few buttons placed conveniently on the underside of the steering wheel! Lovely.  When I first saw my cousin use this feature, he had me convinced it was some sort of Jedi trick to be able to change the stations without reaching over.  The SOUND SYSTEM is incredible.  I'm completely in love with it.  You can actually CONTROL SPEAKERS by manually adjusting (with a little nob) which speaker is being used.  Either, the front, back, left or right, or front left, back right, and so on.  I like mine placed precisely in the middle with the music blaring from all speakers.  I would suggest finding one with a LEATHER INTERIOR (option), it looks better and feels better.  The Grand Cherokee has a built in screen, that can tell the TEMPERATURE (F or C) outside, the MILES PER GALLON you are getting (changable to km) and what DIRECTION you are headed (north, south, east, west...) It just sounds better in the car.  PLus the Laredo has all the other things every car has: CUPHOLDERS, stuff like that.  The car is spacious and leaves room for any activity that you would enjoy partaking in.  Plus, the trunk space is pretty good too.

THE OUTSIDE 
of The wonderful Grand Cherokee Laredo came with four doors, a roof rack to attach whatever... including surfboards.  The body surrounding your car (the gray stuff that looks like plastic) protects it from being hit by people who clumsily open their doors too wide.  I love that.  The body of the Grand Cherokee Laredo, is cut, sleek, trendy, and not too bulky like some other SUVS.  In a word, the Grand Cherokee Laredo is the essence of STYLE.

THE RIDE
is soo soothing.  No scraping the tops of speed bumps, no irritating bumping over everything. It is possible to fly over all those speedbumps and actually have fun, rather than wincing while your car throws you from side to side in your seat.  This baby is a 6 cylinder (V6) and the engine looks like it was made in heaven.  It has a lot of power, and doesn't struggle up hills the way a lot of cars do.  The handling is great.  You can take turns and u turns at relatively high speeds without wondering if you're going to flip over.  This SUV can take any terrain.  

One of the downsides is the gas mileage.  Compared to other SUVS and trucks the Grand Cherokee fairs pretty well, but don't get one and expect to get car gas mileage out of it.  It's an SUV with power and the gas tank knows it.  It usually averages at 18-20 miles per gallon. 

All in all, this SUV is every person's secret dream; the dream to have the power, have the style, feel the speed and to look good having it.  Its more than likely the next best thing to being Tom Cruise in Top Gun.<br><br>
