            O.k., here is the deal: I have two cameras, the $150 Umax Astracam 1800 (1.3MP), and the $500 Ricoh RDC-7 (3.2 MP). Both cameras are not mainstream, but cool if you taker a closer look. They are both small and give good pictures. 

Here is why I like the Umax 1800: It is the one camera that is easily available to take spur-of-the-moment shots. It powers on very quickly (less than 2 sec), and the total time from power-on to "picture taken" is (timed) 3.5-4 seconds. Since the camera is very plain, no additional settings need to be taken care of, and yet it takes great pictures over a wide variety of conditions. Definitely more fun than a film-based camera, especially in low light. 

Also, it runs off only two AA's. The lack of a preview LCD screen is not too bad, it saves energy (camera lasts very long on NiMH's), and it also saves time. 

So when it comes to taking a quick snap, the Umax 1800 is often my preferred camera. I use the Ricoh when I have more time and want better pictures and control, but the Ricoh takes a long time to capture the shot: 

Ricoh RDC-7: 
Take out of protective carrying case (it's expensive, so I keep it in there), take off lens cap, longer power on due to zoom & AF lens, open up fold-away LCD, align camera so desired picture appears on LCD, then shoot (longer delay b/c of AF). Also, the many controls entice you to "optimize" exposure etc. before the shot, taking away even more time. 

Umax 1800: 
Power on, glance through optical viewfinder, shoot. Get decent pictures on almost any occasion! 

So, in light of the recent appreciation that I discovered for my cheap Umax 1800, I decided to give it a positive review. It's better than you might think. I definitely wouldn't want to miss it.

I once posted a few nice shots (great twilight capability), but I can't find them online anymore. Lost in the web...
