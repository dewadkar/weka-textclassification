                I was on the look-out to replace a very unreliable Ford Tempo in the Fall of 1993.  I intended to buy a used car when I happened upon the Saturn lot- new to our city.  I looked at all these new cars for about $2000 more than what the used cars I'd been looking at cost.  I took an SL1 for a test drive and fell in love with it.  I have had a lot of neck and back problems, and find very few cars that I am comfortable in- but this one fit me to a &quot;T&quot;.  I did hesitate somewhat as my dad has always told me to never buy I new car, as they lose $3000 in value as soon as you drive them off the lot.  I decided to go home and visit with my parents about the car choice and told them I was so impressed with the people at Saturn and how they answered your questions without being pushy.  My Dad still held reservations, but he agreed to go with me to look at the car I had chosen.  We took it for another test drive and he was so impressed with the way it handled and the friendliness of the staff that he actually said he thought I should get it.  We did all the paper work that day!
     I have only put 60,000 miles on my car in 6 years but I am still driving on the original tires!  I take my car in every three months for the scheduled maintenance checks and oil changes, but I have had no major problems with the car.  Its biggest drawback may be the compact size as I have been hit twice in parking lots when parked between 2 bigger vehicles. I believe people just pull in thinking that there is nothing parked there, and hit me.  
     I would not recommend this car for a family of any size, as the back seat is very tight and makes traveling with more than 2 people pretty  uncomfortable.  The plus side of this is that the back seats can be laid down to allow a wide variety of trunk size options so that hauling things is quite possible.  I have been told numerous times that people are shocked by the amount of cargo I can carry in my car.<br><br>
