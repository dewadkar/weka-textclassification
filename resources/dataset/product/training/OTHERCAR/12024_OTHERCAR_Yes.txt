            What more can you say about the great technology that has been put into this car.  A 2.0 liter engine pushing out 240 horsepower.  That is unbelievable.  Only Ferrari, yes Ferrari comes close to the amount of horsepower/liter.  Honda is actually the leader in the world with this engine.  There is no other engine in the world (normally aspirated) that has more horsepower per liter than the S2000.  The buck does not stop there.  With its great styling, both interior and exterior, Honda has out done itself once again.  Little extras such as the race-car style starter to the amazing 6-second drop top, this car has all the bells and whistles plus much more.

Not only is this car great too look at, its easy on the wallet.  At a price of just $32,000, there is no other car out there that is comparable to the S2000.

Other specs for this car includes a higher top end speed faster the Mercedes SLK, BMW Z3, and Porsche Boxter (It's main 3 competitors).  It actually is exactly 1 mph faster top end speed than the Boxster.  Think about it, bang for the buck goes definitely to the Honda S2000.  The best car on the road right now at a very affordable price.<br><br>
