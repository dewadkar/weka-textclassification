            I was first attracted to this car because of the looks.  I just love the way it looks from every angle.  I bought my car off-lease with 25,000 miles.  I've owned it for over a year now, and its only been to the shop once -to fix body damage due to a deer running into it.  


The headlights on this car are very bright, aided by foglamps for additional night time brightness.  When the high-beams are activated, the foglamps go off by default.  Fog lamps also don't activate when no lights are on.  I leave my fog lamp button on &quot;on&quot; all the time, so they come on with the parking lamps.  

My car is equipped with the optional 55/45 split bench front seat, a feature that is becoming increasingly uncommon especially in sportier models and now totally extinct in coupes.  It means I can accomidate a third front passenger when the need arises, but also means I lost out on a second cupholder and a power port.  No need to worry if the idea of bench seats in a coupe doesn't appeal to you.  Oldsmobile only made 1000 or so for the '96 model year.  Finding one so equipped is a next to impossible task.  The majority of the 30,595 coupes were built with the bucket seats and floor shift console that was standard on all models.  

Since it is a two door, rear seat access is somewhat limited.  All my passengers that have to sit back there complain that I should have got a four-door.  I don't care though, since I don't have to sit there.  Front seats are fairly comfortable for two.  I've actually never had three people sit in the front, but I imagine it would be fairly cramped.  Controls are fairly straight forward.  The radio is positioned lower on the dash than totally ideal.  The cigarette lighter is positioned in an odd place to the left of the climate controls.  I don't smoke, but I find it odd.  Climate controls are easy to use, but have pictures for each function.  I like words like defrost, heat, bi-level and not arrows pointing to feet or chest or pictures of the window with steam symbol.  Maybe it's so the same unit can be sold in non-English speaking countries, but I find it easier to read a word, than figure out what the pictures mean.

My car has the standard 3.1 V6 with 160 horsepower.  It is great if I'm alone or with one other passenger.  With four or more people in the car, lack of acceleration becomes noticeable.  Engine noise begins to drown out the radio under hard acceleration.  I would say fuel economy is about what I expected.  

Trunk space is adequate at 15.5 cubic feet.  Liftover is not as low as on some cars, but I find that to be a benefit.  How?, it allows items to be squeezed in all the way to the edge without having to worry about the trunk lid crushing them.  Although, when packing alot of items they must be strategically placed to avoid bieng crushed by the hinges.  A 60/40 split rear seatback was available, unfortianately my car doesn't have it.  <br><br>
