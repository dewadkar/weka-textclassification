            I think some of the previous reviewers must have lemons, because my car certainly doesn't exhibit the negativities they're pointing out about it -- I honestly had a hard time thinking of a "con."

I get nearly 40 miles to the gallon on the highway, the interior feels as roomy as my dad's Trailblazer, even though the car is small on the outside. The back seat is comfortable for an adult, and even offers plenty of leg room for adults.

There is a trick to having cool A/C in the summer -- switch it over to interior circulation, using the button directly below the A/C button. If it doesn't have to constantly cool hot air from the outside, and can instead continue cooling already-cool air from the inside, the A/C works better. I didn't have any problems with the heat last winter.

My brakes don't squeak, and the only time *anything* rattles is when I have a bass-heavy song playing very, very loud.  I have the premium 200-watt sound system that comes with the "Moon and Tunes" package, and it's an AWESOME system. I'd highly recommend that package, along with the power/cruise control package.

I have one issue with my transmission that is specific to my vehicle, and still don't know what's going on because it won't do it for the service department at the dealership. But I wouldn't view that as an across-the-board problem by any means.

The only con I could think of would be the price, which is substantially higher than other "college student" cars, but you get what you pay for. With our GM family discount, I got a great deal too.

Overall, my car just looks cool. I get a lot of compliments on it, and I love the way it looks, the way it drives...and I couldn't be more pleased.
