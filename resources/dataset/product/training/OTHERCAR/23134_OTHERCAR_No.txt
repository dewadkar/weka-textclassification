            I bought a 98 Stratus after I totaled my 93 Mazda 626. (Not my fault)Hoping for better or as good gas mileage as the Mazda, I was very disappointed. I get about 18 city mpg and 26 hwy mpg. I have a 99 Camaro Z28 that gets better gas mileage. Sure the Stratus handles better than the Mazda, but it's not as comfortable. It's a nice looking car. At 50k miles, we had to completely replace the rack and pinion assembly. (Thank goodness for an extended warranty) I don't understand why someone would put a gutless 2.0ltr 130hp engine in a car that weighs almost 3k lbs. I can live with bad gas mileage if I have power, and vice versa, bit with the Stratus, I get neither. Is there anything i can do to get better gas mileage out of this car? Or more power? Any bits of advice would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>
