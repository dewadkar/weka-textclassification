            Sometime back in 1996 I happened along a small dealership to find this lower priced vehicle.  With a 5-speed and the standard engine I figured I would be able to get good mileage and save a few bucks.  What I didn&#146t know is that I would end up depending on this car through one of my worst experiences of life.

The really short version:  I was ran off the road while on my way to work and passing in Gilroy, CA and rolled this car a week after I bought it.  This lovely red 2-dr wonder rolled 3 or 4 times at high speed and came to a stop upside down.  The car was demolished but the interior area was not pressed in whatsoever! I walked away from an accident that the wrecking yard had figured &#147nobody could have survived&#148.

Granted the car did not shutoff after rolling and rupturing the fuel lines off the injectors causing a small fire but I had turned off the engine when getting out &#150 thus no explosion. During the first roll &#150 the moment it hit the roof I was thrown into it as my foot was pulled away from the pedal thus releasing the seatbelt &#150 the only thing keeping me in the car was my unbelievable grip on the steering wheel (which was bent and mangled a bit when I looked at it later).  All of this 1 month before my first child was born - If I had been in any other car, I doubt I would have survived to see her or her sisters to follow.

The car drove superbly prior to the accident (which totaled it and was a complete write off) and was one of the quickest 4-cyl cars I have ever driven.  The clutch felt like competition grade and anyone not feeling really comfortable with a clutch might be intimidated with how quickly the clutch grabbed.

The back seat was ample for 2 people of average build but I would not want to ride in the back for long durations, as the seats were a bit lacking in comfort.

The trunk on this car was built like the perfect acoustic subwoofer box!  With the two Kenwood speakers I had in the back window I didn&#146t even feel I needed to add subwoofers &#150 it was amazing.

Anyone looking for a good used car &#150 I would strongly recommend this car in the 2-door with a 5-speed variety.
