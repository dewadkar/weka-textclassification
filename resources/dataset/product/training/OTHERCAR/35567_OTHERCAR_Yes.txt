            The Setting:  I was in the market for a new or used car back in late August.  I had done a lot of research and I just needed to decide whether or not to get a good used Honda/Toyota/Nissan or a brand new Civic, since they were the only cars I would consider and they would be in my $13000-$15000 price range.   After much debate and a test drive of the Civic I was hooked.  I just couldn't bring myself to buy a used car this time around (my other car I bought used is a Nissan Maxima).  Why worry about what someone else had done to a car I was now driving when I could buy a new one?  

The Car:  I purchased a silver Civic LX coupe with Automatic.  This car has a 4 cylindar engine that produces 115 hp, which surprisingly is quite nice.  It has enough get-up-and-go to make me happy!  It's not a car that's going to break any records but you're not buying a civic for that purpose.  The estimated mpg are supposed to be 30/38 for city/highway driving but I'm only getting around 26.  Take note however that I'm only driving this car back and forth to work some 4 miles or so each way.  I'm sure if I were driving on the highway or had less stop and go I'd greatly increase my mileage.  

Some of the other nice features that this car comes with is an Immobilizer Theft-Deterrent System that prevents someone from stealing car without the key (at least that's what they say!)  It also has both driver and passenger front air bags, power windows w/auto down driver's window, power door locks, cruise control, and tachometer.  The rear seats fold down 40/60 so that you can better utilize the trunk space.  One of the big features of the rear seating area is the elimination of the characteristic middle floor hump seen in most cars.  Honda redesigned the undercarriage so that they could get rid of the hump and generate more cabin room.  Very good move Honda!  

The instrumentation panel lights up to a glowing red at night which is surprisingly easy on the eyes.  The buttons and dials for the stereo, air, and such are well placed and I'm very comfortable with them while I'm driving.  The seats are bucket and albeit a little stiff for the long ride, do seem to support nicely.  The civic also has an audible beep to let you know when you leave your lights on and begin to exit the car.  This feature alone has probably saved me a few times!  All cars should have this 'You idiot' feature.  

Notes:  I've had my car now for about 5 months.  It has less than 3000 miles on it.  Yes less than 3000 miles!  I have not taken it in yet for an oil change but I will soon since it gets a lot of stop and go action.  The original stereo that it came with also included a casette player (who has casettes anymore?).  I added an aftermarket CD player ($200) myself that fit perfectly into the odd shaped space.  I also added an aftermarket alarm ($200) to protect my liability (notice it's not an asset yet!).  When I bought it from the dealer, I got one that came right off the truck.  By doing this, I avoided them adding those unnessary items like the pin-stripping (ugly) and mud flaps (ugly), and thus avoided their instant mark-up.  I hit the local Pep Boys for $30 floor mats.  The tires are 14 inch Firestones and pretty generic but I'll see how long they last.  

Overall review:  Overall, I give this car an 8 out of 10 stars.  I really enjoy driving it despite the small engine and yet it really moves once it gets started.  Reliability should be great and I'm hoping that this car last quite some time.  I would recommend this car to those of you who need an excellent reliable but inexpensive car.
