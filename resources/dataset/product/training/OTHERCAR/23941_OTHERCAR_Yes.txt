            The Mercedes-Benz SLK Kompressor is one of the spotest, enjoyable, fun, fastest car that i have ever driven.  I origially heard about this car from the internet.  I was looking up cars and i found this and it was like love at first site. Literally!!  I absolutly love how it is sporty, soooooooooo comfortable, and roomy in the font.  I really have no need to go fast, but this car just wants to make you go fast it is soo umbelievable neat.  I also love to looks of it.  The outside of my car is silver and the interior is charcoal and it looks just stunning i would recommend those colors defianity.  The car is quite and smooth.

You will totally not ever regret it.  i would also remomming getting it in a manual, because it is better on the car and you also get better gas milage.  So the next time you are looking for a new exciting car get the Mercedes-benz SLK it is totally worth it i promise!!! 1 million thumbs up!<br><br>
