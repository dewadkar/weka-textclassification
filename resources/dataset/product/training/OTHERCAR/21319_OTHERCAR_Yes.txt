            In June of 1999, I went on a hunt to find a comfortable, economical, good looking car to purchase.  Since I am in the sales field and on the road the majority of the time, I needed and wanted a car that looked good, had an exceptional ride and at the same time, had good gas mileage.  I looked and drove and researched everything from the new &quot;bug&quot; to the Infiniti G and I.

Naturally, I wanted the best of all three worlds.  The Infiniti was a good ride, decent gas mileage, but the cost new was outrageous, even taking into consideration that it came with an extra warranty to 100,000.  The &quot;bug&quot; had a low price, excellent gas mileage, but when you figure the amount of hours I am on the road, I couldn't imagine being fitted into a sardine can for that much time.  I would have had to have a tow truck at home every night to pull me out!!  

I did some research and comparison on the internet and found a surprising result.  The Toyota Camry was listed as having all of the things that I was looking for - reasonable price, comfort and great gas mileage.

Needless to say, the next day I was at the local Toyota dealership to test drive.  Since you already know what I bought, let me tell you about the sales experience.  No hassle, no bull*@$%, and bottom line pricing.  This car has exceeded my expectations over the last 5 months.  Comfort, comfort,comfort.  I can drive 4-6 hours a day and don't even think about the tow truck when I get home.  I've watched my gas mileage range from 34-37 on the highway and smile every time I fill up.  And I can still afford to eat, even with my new car note.  I would recommend this car to my friends, family and associates.  

One more thing, service - I have had one minor adjustment that had to be made to the rims.  I had lost a small part somewhere and expected a huge time loss and a big hassle when I brought it in.  I drove in, talked to the sales manager, who sent me to the garage area.  The manager there looked at the rim, told me where to park, and in less than 5 minutes I was fixed up and out of there.  Now, that is impressive.  I'll definitely by Toyota again and again.
