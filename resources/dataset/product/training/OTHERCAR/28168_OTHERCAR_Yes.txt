            There is no doubt Fuji has come up with a winner here.  Based on availability, features, and some decent package deals out there, the S602 has actually set the standard.
But WHAT is that standard?  Medium priced, modern day plastics, in micro small designs and mini buttons made for the average childs hands?  
The S602 is definitely a must have and add-on or replacement for any consumer that has used a SLR before and has a decent knowledge of photography.  It isnt really for the unexperienced 'point-and-shoot' crowd.  Read other reviews for all the pros, as there is a great deal of them!  I will list the major headaches and cons to beware of:
-Small, plastic design with a micro-sized feel to it.  Button placement and size is even smaller, and has spawned the user term of "fumbility"; you can easily fumble mistakes but grazing any number of micro-sized buttons cram packed into the engineering and design.
-If you have small, frail, child-like hands, this camera body may not pose any problems for you.  But if you are the average adult, it will and does.  The provided grip design is there, but it IS NOT a SLR feel or size, and a great deal smaller.  The down-sizing just isnt ergonomic to any full sized adult hand.
-Watch out for prices vrs availability.  The S602 is now commonly avalible worldwide, and pricing is fluctuating.  Whether alone, or with a good package deal, the S602 as of Dec 02 is a RED FLAGGED consumer alert item.  Look around before buying, as price ranges are as much as  /- $300 US for the exact same item(s).
Enjoy.  I am trying!
