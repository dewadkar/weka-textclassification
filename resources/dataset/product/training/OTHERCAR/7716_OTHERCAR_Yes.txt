            I own a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe 4x4. I think it is one of the best vechicles I have ever drove. I recently owned a 1993 GMC Yukon 4x4. That also was one of the best.
    The things I love about this vechicle is that it has a high ground clearance as compared to a Ford Explorer/Expedition or a Dodge Durango. I feel ground clearance gives people who drive it a sense of power and control that they can go anywhere and do anything they want. Also is the Vortech in which Chevy made standard on all models in September 1995 (The 1996 Model Year). Since, it has been one of the smoothest running motors I have ever had the pleasure to drive. The pushbutton 4x4 is also another easy to use item.
    The cons about this vechicle are very few. During the first few 100 miles, on takeoff the vechicle would make a clinging noise. After a few hundres miles the noise and vibration quit. Lets talk about the size of this vechicle. Its very huge and sometimes hard to operate in heavy traffic and tight parking situations. But hey look at the Ford Excursion, that is a totally overly large vechicle.
    In closing I would recommend this vechicle to anybody with a passion for power and security.<br><br>
