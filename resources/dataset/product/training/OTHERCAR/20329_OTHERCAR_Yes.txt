            I purchased my '96 Altima in 1999 with 36K mi on the clock, and have added 50K myself. The car has a 5-speed and virtually no options, but does include a stock AM/FM cassette stereo with Clarion speakers that sounds quite good.<p>The performance is well rounded in all respects. Acceleration is brisk enough at around 8.0 sec to 60 mph. Torque-steer is a problem, though, and any more power would be hard to deal with. The car can certainly get out of its own way, though, even with four people inside. Handling is solid, although the Super Toe Control rear suspension (a type of passive four-wheel steering) has a funny way of moving the back end in hard cornering, that is rather unsettling. Steering is sharp but effort is on the light side at highway speeds. The suspension is fairly taut, but provides a bit more pavement feedback than I would prefer. Fuel economy is excellent given the performance. I have gotten up to 34 mpg on road trips with the cruise control engaged (and a tailwind, most likely); 32 is quite normal for long trips. On mixed city/highway I get between 23 and 28. The longest distance on a tank I have achieved is 430 miles.<p>Seats are fairly supportive but a bit small for me. The previous owner deformed the right wing bolster so that the driver sits lightly askew; I have seen other Altimas with this same condition. The problem seems to be that the bolsters are too close together for someone with a broad torso like mine (and perhaps the previous owner's as well). The driving position is fine on the whole, but my size (6'4") makes things less than optimal. The seat does not go back far enough, which leaves my legs folded beside the steering wheel. The bottom cushion is also too flat and does not tilt, which leaves my thighs unsupported and puts my ankles at odd angles to the pedals. There is also no dead pedal (just a pad against the wheel well), which means that my left foot rests behind the clutch. Thus my entire leg must be retracted in order to shift.<p>At highway speeds the outside mirrors whisper rather loudly, and pavement texture can be heard clearly through the floor. One rear anti-roll bar bushing has groaned going over speed bumps since I got the car, and all of them make noise when the temp. drops below freezing (other Nissans I have ridden in do the same thing). Nissan seems to cut costs on their suspension fittings and interior materials. Brakes (on mine, front disc/rear drum, no anti-lock) are strong but do not have the greatest feel at the pedal, which sometimes seems weak even though the car stops just fine. Otherwise the car responds well to enthusiastic driving. It doesn't handle like the Audi I used to have, but it doesn't have the Audi's tooth-rattling ride and exorbitant repair costs, either.<p>Speaking of repairs, the Altima has proved relatively robust. The starter died at 45K mi., which resulted in two separate tows that inflated the total cost of the incident to $450. CV boots had to be replaced at 80K. Aside from that, the only problem was caused by a cretin who smashed my driver's window, which deformed the track and messed up the one-touch-down function. The trunk is amply large, but the rear seat does not fold (though other reviewers here seem to think theirs do; I would love it if that were the case), the opening is oddly shaped, and the gooseneck hinges impinge on cargo.<p>All told, the car has been a good companion on numerous trips (including one cross-country move), has enough ground clearance and traction to drive in moderate snowfall (with the proper technique), and has been virtually worry-free. Not perfect, but better than a lot of cars.
