            In late 1995, my mother purchased a gently used 1993 Pontiac Grand Prix GT with only 12,000 miles on it.  We later learned that she was the <b>third</b> owner of the car.  The first owners had traded it in for a sportier Mitsubishi 3000 GT, and the second owner, a retired veteran, traded it for reasons I will disclose in a moment.  It doesn't take much to satisfy my mother, she loved the car because it was fast, red, and sporty. Anyone with more discerning criteria should look elsewhere.

<b>Exterior </b>
The Grand Prix GT was a nice looking car.  While certainly appealing to an older crowd, it was sleek and sporty for its time--with lower body cladding, ground effects, spoiler, and multi-spoke wheels combining to form an aggressive look.  Door handles hidden away in the center roof pillar gave the side of the car clean lines.  

On the downside, there were a lot of fit and finish issues.  The second owner had noticed a lot of shallow dents along areas where body panels had been riveted to their frames.  When he tried to get Pontiac to fix them, the company called the dents hail damage and refused.  Funny that the hail crept into his garage and managed to place two perfectly straight rows of evenly-spaced dents along the hood, so he traded the Grand Prix in for a Ford Thunderbird.  In fairness, the dents were hardly noticable, but it was clear that it was a manufacturing defect. 

The paint on the non-metal parts of the body started coming off about a month after the warranty expired.  After a few trips through the car wash, mom was left driving a car with yellow fiberglass beaming through the cherry red finish on the spoiler and body cladding.  Pontiac of course refused to repair the defect. The factory fog lamps were in constant need of new bulbs because moisture managed to seep inside the housing, Pontiac found no problem.

<b>Interior </b>
The Grand Prix we had was well-equipped with all power features, AM/FM cassette, cruise, A/C, automatic transmission, and power seats.  The only options it didn't have were a moonroof and leather interior. It was also equipped with a &quot;heads-up&quot; display which projected your speed onto the windshield.  It was an interesting gimmick, but became tiresome very quickly. The seats were quite roomy, particularly the back.  There aren't many coupes that can comfortably fit two adults aft, but the Grand Prix could.

Overall, the interior of the car was <b>extremely</b> cheap looking.  The black cloth seats looked faded from the time we bought the car because the fabric pile was easily crushed, and the seats were completely lacking in any sort of aesthetic detail.  When the car was traded off at 36,000 miles...the front seats were much less firm and supportive than they were originally...unacceptable for a car driven primarily by a woman who weighs 105 pounds.  The dashboard was cheap plastic, and the power window buttons and other controls were too large and clumsy looking.  The amber colored dash lights made night time driving an unpleasant experience.  

Interior quality seemed to be up to par with exterior--as the tape player malfunctioned on at least two occasions, requiring replacement of the entire unit.  The armrests on the door did not hold up well to use, there was noticeable wear on the cloth door panels by 20,000 miles.  Buttons for climate control popped off every other time the temperature settings were adjusted, and there were several places on the dash where large gaps between pieces had formed.  

<b>Power and Performance</b>
The Grand Prix's only saving grace was its powerful six-cylinder engine. Drop the pedal and the car would hit ninety while most cars were still under the stop light.  The automatic transmission was remarkably smooth. Even on hard acceleration, shifting went almost unfelt.  In 36,000 miles the only mechanical problem was the need for two new batteries and an alternator.  While appearance and convenience items fell apart from the beginning, the engine developed no loss of power or performance over the time we owned the car.  

<b>Overall</b>
For a car priced similarly to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, the Grand Prix had a lot of catching up to do.  While it was more powerful than it's foreign competition, build quality just wasn't up to snuff.  <br><br>
