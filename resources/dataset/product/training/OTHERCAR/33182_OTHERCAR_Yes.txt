            The ACURA INTEGRA,  I myself own a 1999 INTEGRA V TECH.  After owning 4 previous vehicles, I feel that I am quite experienced in the automotive world.  So, my opinion is one you can trust.  This car would definitely receive a five star ranking from me.  It is such a great car.  First of all, as a young person, I know that all my peers like this car.  It has a beautiful body style.  Itï¿½s small and sporty, and has a design that would suite either a man or a woman.  It has a relatively small engine, yet is still very quick.  It is very efficient on gas.  I suggest the manual transmission, because I test drove both and the manual seemed to have better pick-up.  It handles quite well.  It has a very smooth ride and on turns as if it is on rails.  It seats four rather comfortably. Along with the safety features such as dual side airbags and anti-lock brakes, this car would definitely have a excellent safety record.  I would recommend this car for people of all ages, it is definitely a good buy, and very affordable.  So next time you are in the market for a new car, take a look at the ACURA INTEGRA.  P.S. the sun roof is great!!!<br><br>
