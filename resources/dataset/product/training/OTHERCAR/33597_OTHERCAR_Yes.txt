            I drove every luxury car on the market and I assure you this is the best buy of the luxury class under $40,000. I purchased a 1999 C230 Kompressor and let me tell you, it took my breath away. Originally, I went looking at the Volvo S40 or S70 for their safety features. I drove them and it was a nice ride, but nothing spectacular, other than a safety cocoon. I then looked at the BMW323, a car I thought for the last 10 years was my dream car. I drove it and it was nice, a little stiff, but as the BMW salesperson told me, the car is geared for men and was made to be a more stiff drive. I heard there was a Mercedes-Benz on the market that also fit this price range. I did extensive research using consumer reports and car &amp; driver, both online and magazine versions and discovered that the C230 was rated as high or higher in all categories as the BMW and the Volvo.
My previous vehicle was an Infiniti G20 and I absolutely loved it so I looked at the new G20 and the I30. Both drove extremely well, but I was looking for more power than the G20 and a smaller size car than the I30. I value great service and this is what I expect from the Mercedes service and sales staff just as I received from the Infiniti.
The car drives like a dream, with all of the features you can imagine, including a weather band station on the radio and the option to have a phone installed through the radio controls. I have been extremely pleased with the car, handling and gas mileage, not to mention the look of the car. I research thoroughly prior to any purchase and I assure you... no buyer's remorse.<br><br>
