            I've been the only owner of my Maxima.  It has been the most reliable care I've ever owned.  I'm slightly over 130,000 miles and the only things to go wrong are:

1 leaky freeze plug.
Clock doesn't always display.
Bose sound system is shot.
Black leather seats are starting to get a little hard.
Power steering pump starting to whine.

I've performed all of the maintenance on the car.  Tune-ups and oil changes are easy.  The timing belt took some work but it wasn't too bad.  The paint and interior are holding up great and I'm not one of those types who washes and waxes the car every two weeks.

The biggest disappointment has been the Bose sound system.  The Bose systems are bad in most makes of cars.  This has been well documented in newsgroups.

If your looking for a used car and you find a Maxima in your price range, buy it!
