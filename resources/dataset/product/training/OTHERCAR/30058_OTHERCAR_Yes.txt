            As this is my virgin review, let's hope I do an OK job.
I bought the DC280 after PC Magazine awarded it their Editor's Choice late last year (1999).  I can't say that I'm disappointed.

I purchased the DC280 because I'm impulsive! No, I really wanted a high-quality camera that could generate enough pixels for a photo-realistic 5x7 print.  Also, I was looking for a decent package (rechargeable batteries, good memory card...). Here too, Kodak delivers.  Current buyers are benefiting from the memory shortage, as Kodak is shipping the DC280 with either a 16MB card + 8MB card (what I got) or a 32MB card (oh well) verses the advertised 20MB card.  The card and rechargeable battery combo that Kodak offers is around a $75-$100 value over the usual package I would say.

Adding to the positives are the camera's superb image quality. I've taken advantage of Ofoto's free digital printing offer (ofoto.com) and ended up with many great prints. The photos are indistinguishable from 35mm, even at the 5x7 size. (I've yet to try 8x10) That's my opinion as well as the people I've shown them to.  Also, the camera is a joy to use, and the features are easily accessible via the dial on the back of the camera.  Image transfers have been a breeze due to the fact that I somehow received a free CompactFlash reader with my camera purchase.  Otherwise, take advantage of the speedy USB option (I can't use b/c I'm running Windows NT.)

On the 5% negative side, the camera is lacking in a few areas, namely manual controls, the lack of a macro (close-up) option, and a measly 2x zoom.  I'm disappointed that a camera that retails for $800 only gives you a 2x zoom, but oh well. Also, you just can't beat that Nikon Coolpix swivel design.  I did read one review where the reviewer lamented the camera's delay in shutting off after taking pictures. This was due to the camera having to process the images before retracting the lens and powering down.  Luckily, Kodak has issued a firmware upgrade on their web site that fixes this problem and a few others like the NiMH battery indicator's accuracy. Don't you love technology sometimes? The above-mentioned delay was a gripe of mine too, so I'm happy it's fixed.

When everything is totaled though, the DC280 delivers for the price. I would probably go with the Nikon Coolpix 950 given the same price and bundled package, but the Coolpix costs more and has an 8MB card, no USB, and no rechargeable batteries.  The DC280 would be an excellent choice for beginner and intermediate photographers. One thing to add to the initial package: memory. You don't want to fill up your memory card and end up having to erase images. Discounted on-line prices for CompactFlash cards make these a wise investment.<br><br>
