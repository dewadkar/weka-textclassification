            Why do I say that its more for your money? Basically because when my mom bought me this car, she got it for $4,500. Its worth more because for the age of the car, I have only had to do the routine maitenance. I have gotten oil changed and brakes/rotors, and the only part that let me down was the power steering pump. Aside from that, I know that this is one car I can rely on.

Many people say that used is not the way to go because you are buying somebody else's problems. In the case of my car, that was not it at all. The woman who sold us the car had to get rid of it because she owed a lot of money on an SUV and needed the money to pay it off. She said if she had the choice, she would have chosen the Prism. That surprised me at first, but now I know why.

The backseat is a little cramped but is good if you have small children, just not for older adults. The pick-up is so-so...I have a 5-speed and it sometimes has trouble picking up speed when I need it, but once it gets going, it goes pretty fast. The gas mileage is great. I don't need to fill up until I'm at about 240-250 miles, and it only costs me about $15.00 to fill up the tank all the way.

This car will definitely be my car until I can afford something of more luxury. Although the Prism isnt the most luxurious, it makes up for it with style, and reliability.
