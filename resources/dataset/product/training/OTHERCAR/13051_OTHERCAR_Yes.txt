            I have owned my Pontiac Grand Prix LE since the spring of 1993.  My car has been very dependable, and was well worth the money that I spent on it.  I have had very little upkeep on my car.  I have had to replace the alternator, struts, tires  and recently have had to have the air conditioner repaired.  The car is equipped with power door locks, power windows, and am/fm cassette radio.  It is not a fancy car, which is good.  As it gets older, it does not have as many parts to break!   The car does not have the comfort of some other cars that I have owned, it just doesn't have the smooth ride.  

I commuted in this car and it has mostly highway miles.  The car gets really good mileage, about 25 miles to the gallon the highway.  

  I would recommend this car to anyone based on the reliability of the car.<br><br>
