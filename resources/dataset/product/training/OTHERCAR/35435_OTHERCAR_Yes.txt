            More fun than I've ever had with my clothes on! I just picked  mine up a week ago, but researched them for a long time on the internet at many different sites and few cars have ever impressed so many people positively as the MINI Cooper. Is it perfect? Well no, but is it close to perfection? If you are looking for a fun ride, then the answer is an unequivocal YES! It has to be run a little hard to get the most out of it, under 2000 RPMS a little sluggish, but over 2000 RPMS and it is like someone lit a fuse on a firecracker. It zips, and you as a driver become one with it. Think turn and you have turned, not that I advocate quick lane changes, but if you need to make an evasive maneuver in a heart beat than this is the car to do it in. I got the base model as I did not think that the MINI Cooper S models that I saw warranted the additional $3,000 to $5,000 more that the dealer wanted. Even though I got a base model it came standard with A/C, p/w p/l AM/FM with CD, tilt wheel, keyless entry and more fun quotient than anything I have ever driven. Oh by the way I am a BIG man, 6'2" and 350# and yes I fit in it very well and have less problems getting in and out of it than my wife's Buick Century. It takes premium gas, but at about 33 MPG not that big a deal, and like I said it zips. Plan on having this car for a long time to come.
