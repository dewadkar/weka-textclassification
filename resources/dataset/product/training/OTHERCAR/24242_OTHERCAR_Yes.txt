            I love the way my '98 Tahoe looks and handles.  I have put 60k miles on it in two years.

It's got plenty of power, corners great and stops well.

The AM/FM Cassette/CD sound system is good.  (I did have to have a speaker replaced, but it was covered by warranty.)

I don't like the way the Anti-Lock system in the brakes make that grinding sound when you hit the brakes hard.

The seat is comfortable, even for long trips.  The passenger seat slides forward to allow access to the back, but not as far as it used to.  (I have to get that looked at.) 

I regret not getting a 4 door with a bench seat, solely because I cannot put all 4 of my kids in seat belts at once.  (When I have all 4 kids I try to take a different vehicle.)

I may replace the '98 with a 2000 that has the seating capacity, or I may just get a Suburban.  (Either a new one where I trade my truck in, or a slightly used one, and keep them both.)

Either way I am for sure keeping with the Tahoe/Yukon/Suburban/Full Size Blazer line of trucks.

And once I get the raise I want, I may just add a Corvette to keep my truck(s) company.

UPDATE MARCH 8, 2000:
I had the rider for the passenger seat replaced under warranty.  The seat works okay now.  They didn't cover painting the part, so it's grey, but mostly covered by the seat and molding.

I had the front brakes replaced.  (I do have 62K miles on my Tahoe.)

I always have the recommended service done.  I usually get it done by a Chevy dealer, either where I bought it, (Polar Chevrolet in White Bear Lake, MN), or at Moody's in River Falls, WI, because they are close to my job and will give me a ride to work after I drop off my truck.  Moody's also drops my truck off when they finish and I just sign the credit card slip at that time.  I get my warranty work done at Polar because they cover the $100 deductible.

I had my tires rotated for free by Tires Plus and I was told that the steering arms in the were a little loose, but I have not noticed any vibration or excess tire wear.  When I have my oil changed this month, I will have the dealer spec them out.  I will let you know.

UPDATE OCTOBER 19, 2000: 80,000 miles
The dealer checked out my steering and said Tires Plus was trying to sell me a bill of goods.  (I had to pay 50$ labor to find this out.)

I was getting a bit of wobble/vibration before, but I put new, balanced tires on and it cleared right up. I used the same model Goodyear tires that came with my truck. (The new ones are white letter though.)
I am happy with 80,000 miles from a set of tires.

Regular maintenance is a must, especially in a high mileage vehicle like mine.  I really recommend having the dealer do your repair work.  I had the rear brakes replaced now, too.  When the front brakes were put on by a national chain store, they were not properly adjusted and all my braking power was from the back brakes.  It's fixed now.

I still love my Tahoe, but I would sell it for what I owe on it to buy a new one.<br><br>
