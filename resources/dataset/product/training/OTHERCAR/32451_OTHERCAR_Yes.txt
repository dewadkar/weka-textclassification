I bought my Integra from it's original owner.  I will be it's last owner.  The car drives as though it were a body part.  The screams along all the way to the 4000 rpm line at which point the VTEC (variable valve timing and electronic lift control) engine deep wail all the way to the 8000 rpm red line.  Sweet.  I want to be buried in this car.
Service at each 7500 mile mark will cost about $400-$500 (Central, NJ).
Some units are known to have a problem with the right passenger window sticking (I replace mine).
The cup holders are badly positioned blocking access to radio control when a cup is inserted.  The rear seats are virtually worthless for passengers (but I liked that fact).
I removed the installed hand-free car kit since the only place to mount it (on the left side of the front passenger area) interferes with the fron passenger leg room.  The factory radio will work with some Alpine CD changer units.
