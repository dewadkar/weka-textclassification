            After having 3 cars break down on me in the last  7 years, I vowed never to buy a used car again. I could not afford anything too fancy so I went to my local Kia dealer because of the great prices. I must admit, I was also seduced by the 10-year warranty. I needed a car that could take the beating of my busy lifestyle. Back then, I drove an average of 500-600 miles a month.

I purchased a standard because it was cheaper and I wanted to try something new (I had heard repairing a clutch was cheaper than repairing a transmission.) I've had the car for almost 4 years now and it hasn't given me a single problem. I take good care of it though, I have it serviced at the recommended mileages and get the oil changed when it's due. 

My Sephia gets good gas mileage and is roomy enough to fit accommodate 5 people. Having the back seats pull forward is a great feature that allows me to fit my mountain bike in the trunk. Having dual airbags also makes me feel safe. Once, I got rear ended on the freeway, and my car did not get much damage. I've taken this car on super-long road-trips (San Francisco to Seattle and back) and even up to the snow a few times. It has never let me down.

If I had to criticize my car's faults I would mention, that it's engine power is average, and a little loud at times, and the brakes feel touchy when the car is cold. It's craftmanship is not great... the interior materials are a little cheap, but you get what you pay for. 

Overall, I still think the Sephia is a great economy car. It's worth the price and has allowed me the freedom to travel all over the west coast without any worry of breaking down.
