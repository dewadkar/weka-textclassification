            We purchased a '98 Passat Wagon after researching all other new model wagons, from the high end Audis, Mercedes and Volvos to the economical Hondas and Subarus, the Subarus being the most like in price for 4 cylinders (the 6 cylinder Passat has lots of pizzaz but too high a sticker price for us). We wanted a car with room for a dog kennel, skis, luggage, and would not look too vanilla-ee, and we wanted some getupandgo on the highway. Our community is inundated with Subarus, and since we are not soccer parents, and don't wear birkenstocks, we felt the Subarus were not sympatico with us owner-profile wise.  We liked the look of the Toyota Camry Wagon, but Toyota stopped making these in '96, and the price was still high on the used ones in town.  

We found out about the Passat (in its first year of production with the new body, same as the Audi A4) through car &amp; driver type magazines, and eventually located the VW website and a VW dealer.  In all comparisons with both foreign and domestic wagons, the VW won hands down in performance, economy, styling and particularly in warranty.  We were not able to bargain well with the single VW dealership here, so we went out on the internet and found a model in a neighboring state with everything we wanted and he was willing to drive it over to us (and I threw in $100.00 for his efforts). 

The car handles like a dream.  Very tight corners, smooth running engine, very little noise inside.  Does well on wet and snowy surfaces.  After driving Explorers and Suburbans for 15 years, I can finally parallel park in a heartbeat.   

Love the interior styling with blue-lit dash at night (just like those used by pilots).  Great stereo system, high-tech locking system, moon roof (some minor glitches with the factory one, so the VW dealer here replaced it at no cost), etc.  At first I thought the seats were a tad uncomfortable, but now I can't imagine anything better suited to driving posture since the seats are quite firm, and I'm sure lots of German know-how went into that.  It has the standard feature of a turbo shifting mechanism, which I am too lazy to use so I just keep it in automatic.  For a 4 cylinder, it has plenty of pep and I love peeling out of my neighborhood and onto a 45 mph street where I have to merge quickly and it never lets me down. On long distances, and at higher freeway speeds, it was smooth and silent and driving felt effortless.  The VW service has been excellent.  There's no detailed maintenance for the first 100,000 miles.  I'm not technical so don't ask me why, ask the VW dealer.
It does well in snow.  We're very pleased!<br><br>
