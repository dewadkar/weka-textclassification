               Early last year I purchased a 1998 Dodge Stratus ES.  It's a four door sedan with power windows, locks, etc.  I bought it with the V-6 engine.  I recommend the V-6 over the four cylinder.  When you purchase the V-6 it comes standard with Dodge's 4 speed &quot;autostick&quot;  this is just like an automatic except if you shift down one notch below the &quot;D&quot; setting what would normally be &quot;D1&quot; turns your car into a stick shift!!!  Now there is no clutch to work, a simple tap to the right &quot;up-shifts&quot; the vehicle, and a simple tap to the left &quot;downshifts&quot; the vehicle.  This car is perfect for the long trips you take the wife and kids on,  but it also has enough guts to keep you thinking your a kid driving your first hot rod.  
I recommend that you drop the wife and kids off first!!!!  I've had the car for over a year, and with routine maintenance I have never had a problem!!!!!  I recommend this car for anyone that needs the room of a sedan but that still likes to kick up their heels every now and then.<br><br>
