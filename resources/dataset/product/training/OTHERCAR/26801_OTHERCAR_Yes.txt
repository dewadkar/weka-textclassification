            I have approximately five years experience with this SUV. I have been quite pleased with the handling and comfort of this SUV, on-the-road and off-road. I test drove for comparison, the 1990 Jeep Cherokee, 1990 Toyota Forerunner and the 1990 Ford Explorer. All three of these SUV handled and drove like a truck. The Jeep had a dated dash with poor ergonomics. The Toyota felt the slowest of the bunch in acceleration. The Ford Explorer's seats were not comfortable for my wife who is petite. Only the Pathfinder drove like a sedan with seats that my wife could fit. 

I was even more surprised by the Pathfinder's off-road capabilities. I took it to the Hollister HOV in California where I saw Jeep CJ5s and CJ7s get stuck in the closed-circuit course. Where the Jeeps became stuck, the Pathfinder climbed with aplomb. Never did I feel that I was losing control. Also, the suspension handled everything the course could dish out. On the highway, this SUV never felt "ungainly". It's suspension has been compared to the Range Rover as an equal. The only "downside" to this SUV is that the 4WD system must be engaged before the SUV reaches 25 mph and is only part-time. Controls are within easy reach for the driver. 

Blind spots are similar to what you find in a station wagon provided that you don't op for the spare tire mount that attaches to the rear of the SUV. If you do, expect to lose some rear vision. The gas mileage for this SUV is spot on for 15 city, 18 highway. Too bad I sold this SUV several years ago but I can see why this was the highest rated SUV at the time.
