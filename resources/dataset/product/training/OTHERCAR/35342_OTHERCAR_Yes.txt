            We bought our Used 1996 Town and Country 2 years ago. We have been happy with the comfort and the luxury the van offers.  About 55K miles have been put on it to bring it to 93K miles.

We have just had the Transmission Overhauled at 93K miles.  Also have had struts and shocks replaces.  We have had no other major problems, though it took over a year for the dealership to figure out our transmission problems. With lots of research I have learned that transmission problems with this model (Dodge and Plymouth also) are very common.  

The leather in the LXi is very plush and easy to clean.  The interior is very similar to the Dodge and Plymouth versions with a few extra upscale features such as wood grain paneling, two tone leather and a great sound system.  

The Captains chairs are a great addition.  We find it convenient to go out with other couples in this van.  It is nice enough to take on a night out or to the zoo with the family.  It is great for taking the scouts to camp, the kids to practice and for long cross country trips (we have taken 3 in it)

We enjoy many of the little &quot;cubbies&quot; that it offers, such as the over head console that you can store your sunglasses in and garage remote control.  There is also a great storage bin on the passenger side seat that is great for just about anything.  The Kids enjoy the two &quot;cubbies&quot; on either side of the rear bench seat to store their traveling CD player or other activities to keep them busy on short or long trips.

This is a good family van with lots of cargo space. It is interior is durable and forgiving.  It is easy to clean because of the removable interior seats. You can haul long items such as wood and also fit in big items such as a sectional couch.(yes we fit it in just fine!) We have moved a washer and dryer also in the back of this van with no problems.  

The Van still runs quiet and smooth.  It handles like a dream and I enjoy driving it anywhere I go.  It has had a few electrical problems but nothing major.  Over all with the everyday wear and tear we put into it, this van has held up like a champ!
