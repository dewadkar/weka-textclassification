            I love my new red with beige interior, 2001 Toyota Corolla Le... my husband and I shopped for a month before we bought this car. I am not a car person other than i want it to be pretty and reliable. 

I drive a full size van most of the time and really enjoy my Corolla LE. We paid 15,340 for a loaded LE with a spoiler and CD player added. this was $300 over invoice, no fees and i mean no fees at all.  They tried to add Admin fee and temp. tag fee and my husband said no fees and that means no fees and they took them off. It was 15,340 plus 5.9% tax...

We bought the Corolla after trying the Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra, Dodge Neon and Ford Zx2. I liked the Nissan and the Honda, but I think the Toyotas reputation for a quality car is what sold us. 

I love the way this car drives. It has lots of pep and is comfortable, with the spoiler it is very sporty looking to me. It has all the bells and whistles and we added a keyless entry/security at Circuit City for $179.00. I like the looks of the new S model but hate the Black interior.

Driving this car feels like you are in a much larger car and not a compact car. The Nissan Sentra and the Honda Civic are also fun to drive. 

I would recommend this car to anyone wanting a car that is fun to drive and not to expensive. My daughter who is 13 now thinks we now have a cool car.
