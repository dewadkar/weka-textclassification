            I bought my Saturn SL2 brand new in 1993.  It was my first new car.  Next year, my car will turn 10!  It's amazing how time flies.  First of all, I want to say that going to a Saturn dealership is nothing like going to any other car dealership.  The sharks aren't circling the lot, waiting to pounce on you.  They are friendly and helpful and not pushy.  My salesman was nothing but laid-back and patient and when I would go, "Should I get THIS?" he would just reply, "It's totally up to you and what you can afford."  Another thing I like about Saturn is the price that's on the vehicle is the price you pay.  I know a lot of people like to haggle and think they are getting the best deal possible, but when you think about it, those dealerships already have a price in mind that they are willing to let the car go for, so pretty much they jack up the sticker price, so you will have some fair haggling room.  I mean, you go to Wal-mart and pay what's listed, why can't a car dealership be that way too?  

My car is pretty basic.  I bought mine off the lot and at that time couldn't afford many of the extras like power windows and locks which I found out are a must on a four door.  The next vehicle I purchase WILL HAVE power locks and windows!! :)  The extras I did get were a cassette stereo, cruise control, A/C and a rear spoiler.  The spoiler just happened to be on the particular car I picked.  Like I said, I didn't special order it.  The spoiler, in my opinion, gave it a more sporty look to it in addition to the way the front of the car looks.  

As I mentioned earlier, my car will turn 10 in June 2003 and I can say that it has been a VERY reliable car.  The only major things that I have had to repair are the timing chain and the alternator, which was replaced twice.  The alternator went out at approximately 40,000 and then the second went out at approximately another 40,000 miles.  The timing chain went out on me at around 80,000 or 90,000 miles. The other service expenses are what you expect with keeping an aging car driveable and safe.  Plus, considering I'm not the best maintenance scheduler/keeper, my car has held up quite well.  There have been quite a few times where I've let the oil change go over a few thousand miles over the usual 3K.  

The only complaints I have, which are very minor, are that the backseat is not the most comfortable for long car trips and the car isn't that smooth going over a bumpy driveway.  But these are really minute complaints and overall I am very pleased with my Saturn and will most likely buy another Saturn after I retire this one.  

--Update as of 2/12/03 -- I ended up buying a 2003 Honda CR-V.  The VUE was a little on the expensive side for what is offered.  Oh, well.  C'est la vie.
