            My 1995 Chevrolet Beretta is about 9 years old, has over 90,000 miles on it, and is still holding strong.  In fact, I've only had to take it into the shop once-- to get my brakes changed, (what can i say, I'm a hard &#147braker&#148.) I live in Iowa, a state where we get freezing cold winters (think heavy snow, ice, the ice melt used for roads, and temperatures below 0 degrees), rainy springs (think hail and wind), and burning hot summers (heat, sun, and temperatures over 90 degrees).  The roads are extremely bumpy and cracked from the weather, making driving really hard on cars, not to mention the shocks.  My car has been through all of this for almost a decade, and is in the same excellent condition as when I first bought it.

Here are some more of my thoughts on my 1995 Chevrolet Beretta.

The first thing I notice is how excellent this (big) engine in this car is.  The acceleration is quick and powerful.  I get great power from the engine and can go from 0 to 60 miles in 8-9 seconds!  I barely touch my gas and I'm up and away.  I find the every day drive to college is excellent on the Interstate.  My Beretta drives very smoothly and quietly at high speeds.  I can go 95 MPH and my car will still ride smoothly.  (Shhh, don't tell anyone about my "accidental" speeding...) ;)

The front of the car is very spacious-- this is an excellent car for people tall people with long legs.  I'm 5'8" and my head is barely above the wheel! (That is, if I'm slouching, and I often do.)  However, the back seat isn't as spacious.  There is hardly leg room.  Because of the lack of space in the back seat, this is definitely a one or two person car, not a family car.  Speaking of space, the trunk in this car is HUGE.  This may be a good thing for most people, but not for me.  I've turned my trunk into a storage place for all my junk.  This is a habit I must dispose of.

I love the ABS brakes on my Beretta.  They have saved me from many accidents from sudden-stopping drivers, (gotta love those people).  The brakes also work very well in the rain, sliding has never been a problem.  The reason I had to change my brakes is because my brake pads were finally wearing down, and I waited to long to replace them, thus ruining my rotors.  Getting rotors changed is NOT cheap.  I have learned from my mistake!

Because of this car being very compact, parking is a breeze.  Getting out of the car can be a struggle due to the long, heavy doors, but I find them beneficial.  Lets say the wind picks up and pushes against the door while I'm getting out.  Does the door fly outward and hit a neighboring car? Rarely.  This is why I like the heavy doors.

Every car has it downsides and the Beretta has its share.  My Beretta seems to have a few electrical problems.  Sometimes when I turn my car off, and then happens very rarely, the power locks stop working, so I have to restart my car and shut if off to unlock them.  There is no indication of the brights being on or not.  I usually check my brights by turning them off and on before I leave, to make sure they aren't on so I don't blind other drivers.  Another thing that bothers me is the lack of cruise control.  I find cruise control very useful when driving long distances.

Some of the plastic is flimsy.  Part of the dashboard has actually formed a "bubble."    I can only assume this occurred after being in the summer's heat and sun.  Did it melt? I'm not sure, but it's very odd.  I love the steering wheel's texture.  It's very firm and easy to grip.

Driving around tight corners can be tricky if driving fast.  The car tends to lean over a little bit.

The climate control system is a little less than average.  The rear defroster doesn't work too well.  The car takes a long time to heat up in the winter; however, the air conditioning works great in the winter.
