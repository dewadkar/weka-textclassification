            I have just recently purchased a 1993 Buick Skylark,and I can't say enough about this car. I've got the Limited, and it drives and runs like a dream. It has the V6, which is by far better than the other motors of previous Buicks. This car will fly, too, which I found out with my wife in the car. I scared the you-know-what out of her, (merely by accident, you understand)and she was severely ill at me for a couple days. I spotted a friend of mine, and was trying to catch up to him, so I kinda gunned it. Needless to say, the V6 kicked in beautifully, and I was right on top of his bumper in a few seconds. Cool, I said. The wife wasn't too pleased. I am having a hard time with the gas mileage right now though, because of the economy, and gas prices. Overall, this is a cool car.<br><br>
