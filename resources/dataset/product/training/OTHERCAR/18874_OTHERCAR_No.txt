            From the first time my wife saw a RAV4 commercial on TV (in early 1997), she decided she wanted one.  We went to our local Toyota dealer (aka: The Shop of Car Buying Horrors)in October 1997 and 2 salesmen and one manager later, we had ordered a 1998 RAV4 with a 5 speed and all the options, minus a sunroof.  The overall quality of the truck was great, fit and finish were first rate, minus the front cigarette lighter, which shattered and disinigrated the first time we used it.  Mechanically, the truck was wanting.  It is horribly underpowered and the engine sounded in constant distress no matter how we drove it.  The brakes wore out quickly and even after replacement, made more racket than was appropriate for a cat caught in a thresher.  despite the extra outlay of $800 for an extended warranty, the dealer said that we just had noisy brakes and suggested driving with the windows up as a solution.  Following that, the timing belt self destructed at about 39,000 miles, leaving my wife stranded on the interstate.  Sensing a pattern, we scurried down to the VW dealership and traded the roller skate for a 1998 Volkswagen Passat, which we love so far.  All in all, the RAV was ok.  Adequate is about the best I'd give it.  Give it a real engine and a real transmission and maybe then we would have kept it.
