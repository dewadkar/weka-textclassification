            My mother purchased one of these after she crashed her Acura Integra four years ago, and hasn't regretted it since.  She once traded in her stick for an automatic, but other than that, this car is problem free.  I love the power I feel when I cruise around town in this hot model.  This four wheel drive, all terrain vehicle is great for off-roading and snow.  It's got power windows, locks, air, CD player, seat warmers, etc.  The back is great for storage, including taking me to and from college (all you with college kids will understand what I mean).  Not only does it drive smoothley on surface roads, but on the freeway as well.  There's also an optional grate for the back of the wagon, which my mother opted for, and is perfect for transporting our dog and avoiding loitering the car with his hair.  There are also compatable ski/bike racks available for the roof.  All in all, I love this car.  <br><br>
