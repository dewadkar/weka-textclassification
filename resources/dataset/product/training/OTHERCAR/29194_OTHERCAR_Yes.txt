            The Dodge Neon is a great car for such a cheap price.  I have been driving a red one for a few months now and I love it.  It is not anything spectacular but I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a compact car that is roomy and is cheap.  It has great handling and is quiet inside.  This car does not suck up too much gas and you do not have to put much money in to it.  I have not had any problems with it and I love it.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a new compact car for only $12,000.  The Dodge Neon is another great Dodge car.  So go out today and give it a test drive, you will like it.  <br><br>
