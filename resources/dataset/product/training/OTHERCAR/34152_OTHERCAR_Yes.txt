            I don't buy brand new cars. I buy good used cars that hold their value. As a BMW owner/driver for the past five years I had high standards for performance and amenities. I researched Consumer Reports and the Web and quickly narrowed my the field to a few candidates. The Toyota Avalon was high on my list.

I was surprised to find that there weren't many used Avalons to choose from in my area. One dealer advised me that people that owned these cars tended to keep them forever. 

I selected a '96 GLE at a nearby dealer and went with my wife and family to check it out. We were impressed. There was plenty of room for my 6'5&quot; frame, even as a passenger in the back seat! The test drive sealed the deal. The car was tight, responsive, and powerful. 

I've had it for several weeks now and haven't missed my 7 series BMW yet!
