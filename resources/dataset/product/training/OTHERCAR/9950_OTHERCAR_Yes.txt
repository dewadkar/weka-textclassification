            My wife has been the sole owner of our 1994 Geo Prizm.  She has always loved it and has never really had any problems.  She told me that this was one of only 2 American cars that Consumer Reports recommended for this price-range (under $20,000).

In 1998 two of the air conditioning vents kind of broke.  They still let air pass through them, but they would not remain in the direction that you pointed the vents.  We have had to stick little pieces of construction paper between the vent and the dash to keep the vent in one place.  In 2000 the power outlet/lighter died.  In 2001 the driver door handle snapped off, and we had the alternator replaced, and in 2002 the paint on the roof, hood and truck began to fade, and we needed to replace the starter.  A few months ago, little parts of the plastic inside door handles broke off. The automatic transmission is now on its last leg.  

The car now has 140,000 miles on it (most were highway miles).  

I am trying to drive this car for another few months or so, and I will dump it.  So, if you are looking to buy a 1994 Geo Prizm, keep in mind that people like me will be trying to unload our problems.

This car has been great up until now, but if you are looking at one that has this many miles, you better check to see if the owner has already replaced the above things, otherwise you better expect that you will have to do it.

Okay Now it is December 2003 and the car has 145,000 miles and the transmission just went.  I coughed up $1300 for the differential and associated parts (bearings etc) and 3 weeks later the planetary gearset (other part of transmission) just went.  The bearings were a royal pain to locate - There is some mix up in the books and they continued to send the bearings for a 1997 Prizm instead on the ones for a 1994 Prism.  The price quote for thhe newest problem (planets) is $600-$1,200.
