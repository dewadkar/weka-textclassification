            I bought my Nissan Altima after I had my first child an realized I needed to give up every fixing up my Jeep.  I looked at several other cars before I decided to purchase the Altima.  I don't want to lie, there were several cars just as good or better in the same price range, most of them Japanese models from the other major car companies.  What drove me to the Nissan was the year end sale that Nissan does just prior to next years models coming out.  I bought the car just before the 1999s were released.

Some things I like about the car.  It came with a CD and cassette player in the dash.  It gets great gas mileage.  It also came standard with all power windows and a keyless entry key ring.  The front seats are comfortable even on long trips, but I wouldn't want to be in the back for too long.

Overall, this is a good, reliable car.  It gets great gas mileage and only needs oil changes about every 8,000 miles; or at least that is what the mechanics told me.  If you wait until the year end sales you can get a great deal.<br><br>
