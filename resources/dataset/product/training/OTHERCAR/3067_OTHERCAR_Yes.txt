                 What a great car.  We bought a used Intrepid recently (a 1996 model) with less than 40,000 miles on it, and I am thoroughly impressed.  The six-cylinder engine runs superbly, and has lots of get-up-and-go, and handles really well.  My wife doesn't like to be perceived as driving something which looks out-of-date, but she is quite satisfied with this four-year-old model, because it still looks quite stylish.  
     It could use a few more cup-holders, but that's about the only thing I can think of on the negative side.  The seats are really comfortable, and, if need be, with the bench seat in the front, can hold six people.  There is not a tremendous amount of legroom in the back, but we have taken adult friends places, and it is not too cramped for this size car.  I wouldn't recommend it for carrying more than five people for any great distance--go get a minivan for that.  We did the minivan route for aver a decade, but now that our nest is partly empty, we really love driving a real car for a change.  
     It makes me want to find a windy-curvy road, put on my leather gloves, and go for it.  (And the engine is so good, I don't want my wife on a windy-curvy road.)  Overall, I would highly recommend this model for anyone needing a stylish, mid-size, four-door auto with a great engine.<br><br>
