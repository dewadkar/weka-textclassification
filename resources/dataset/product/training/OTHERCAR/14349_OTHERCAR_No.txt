            On a recent trip to Colorado my wife and I picked up a Nissan Altima as a rental car from Budget at Denver International Airport.  We quickly found ourselves enjoying the car due to its comfort and handling.  The only negatives I noted were that the sound system wasn't great (speaker placement is questionable), it wasn't a super quiet ride, and immediate acceleration wasn't there.  Other than that, we really enjoyed it.  

That is, until we were ready to travel across town to visit my brother.  Upon pulling out of the driveway at my mother-in-law's place, the car died.  After letting it set awhile, I managed to get it started again, let it run a bit, turned it off and back on to make sure it would start, then turned it off and told my wife she could take over.  It wouldn't start for her and I wasn't successful in getting it started again, even after letting it cool off.  My wife and a neighbor from across the street who came out to see if we needed help, were initially thinking, <i>vapor lock</i>.  But further deduction and consultation ruled that out.  The car simply failed to perform as it should have.

Too bad because we really liked that car.  However, our unfortunate experience with the Nissan turned into a good one with the Subaru Outback that Budget replaced it with.  (See my review on that.)  Just the same, since others rate the Nissan Altima highly, I would strongly advise reading their reviews on it before ruling against the car.<br><br>
