            I bought my Golf new in '98.  Since then I have had only very minor problems with it.  I drive mostly highway miles, making frequent 300-mile trips between two major cities (at an average speed of about 75 MPH), but I also do a fair amount of city driving inside those cities.  I'm probably not the most gentle driver in the world, but not the most reckless either.  I've got about 56,000 miles on the car.

I just have to say that I love my ride!  First of all, it's positively adorable.  This, of course, is a personal opinion.  It has good handling and very good suspension, and while it's not the quietest ride ever, it's not unbearably noisy.  For the size, the Golf has a LOT of cargo room.  I've hauled large pieces of furniture, bikes, and half a studio apartment's worth of stuff in my car with the hatch closed.  My fiance is always shocked by the amount of stuff we can cram in.  It's also fairly roomy for passengers, although my brother, who is about 6'2", refuses to ride in it because he swears there's not enough headroom in the front (he's also pretty picky).  I always offer to open the sunroof for him.  The Golf gets great gas mileage and has a small tank, about 14 gallons.  It'll fit into tiny parking spots but has good enough pick-up to race a lot of sports cars at stoplights.  I should know.

No car is perfect, of course.  I made the mistake of buying the cassette deck when I bought it and it died an awful death after only about a year.  The seats are pretty awful.  They have zero lumbar support and have a knob rather than a lever for reclining, so if you want to recline you have to crank the knob, which is a pain.  I'd recommend replacing the OEM tires because they are pretty cheap and questionably safe in the rain.  Finally, some of the trim around my shift knob and emergency break has worn.  Also, this car came with a pretty weak warranty--only 2 years/24,000 miles.  

I have seen the new Golfs and they are even cooler-looking than mine, if that is possible.  But the '98 is a fantastic buy and would be a great car for a college student, Young Urban Professional, or family.  When this one runs out, I'll buy another.
