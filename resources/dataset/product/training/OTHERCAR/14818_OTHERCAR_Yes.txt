            The muscle car is still alive. It lives in the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird. These two cars, GM's F-bodies, still remind me of the days when I owned Pontiac GTOs in the late '60s and early '70s. They are just plain fun to drive, if you like the exhilaration of a rocket off-the-line or hugging the curves. The launch from the line is just awesome to feel. And the way they hug the curves, it feels like they are attached to the road.

Now, there are some things about the car that I can't recommend. If you have to sit in the back &quot;seat&quot;, you will not want to take a very long trip. And the &quot;trunk&quot; space isn't anything to write home about.

But this car is not designed to be a family car or a car for hauling things. It is designed to be a muscle car. And it succeeds. The firebird is the more aggressive looking of the two cars. So, if you want to own something that looks like it could eat most any other car on the road (and can back it up), then get the Pontiac Firebird.
