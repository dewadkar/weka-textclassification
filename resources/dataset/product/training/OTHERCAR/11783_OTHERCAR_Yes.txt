            When I finally graduated from college and decided it was time to up-grade my ride I looked no further then the Honda Prelude. Up until this time I&#146d always been a car enthusiast but never had the money to buy a fast car, so as soon as I had my chance I ran (or perhaps drove) to the nearest Honda dealer ship and plunked down my money for one.

Having done my researched, I knew ahead of time that I wasn't buying your parents Accord. I'd read the reviews and knew what to expect and boy did this car deliver!  Compared to other cars in its class 200 horses sounded a little light but when you couple those ponies with a V-Tec engine amazing things occur!  The handling is superb. With the ATTS system (Active Torque Transfer System) that came on my SH model, corners fear me not the other way around. The 5-speed shifter is smooth, I only wish a little shorter, and the sound the engine makes at 5000rpm will put you into a state of nirvana. Nothing sounds like a DOHC V-Tec at full throttle!

Of course performance alone make not an awesome car. To some the outside of this car looks strange, but to others it looks great and I fall under this category. The Prelude looks sporty and sophisticated at the same time. You look equally good pulling up to the office as you do revving the engine at a red light.  The bucket seats are comfortable and hold you well in place. The leather wrapped steering wheel feels nice in your hands; and the black on black exterior in my car looks sharp. 

However, this is where I must do a little complaining. The interior color scheme is nice but looks a little cheap. Honda could have put a little more effort into interior styling.  The door rest, where the window buttons are, looks like cheap plastic one would expect to see on a Hyundai or Kia. The center of the dashboard looks rather generic (another instance of cheap looking plastic.)

This is where my complaining ends though. The car is awesome and the amount of aftermarket parts is astounding. If there&#146s something on the car you don't like, you can change it.  At $18,000 it's a little costly for a 99 but well worth the money.
