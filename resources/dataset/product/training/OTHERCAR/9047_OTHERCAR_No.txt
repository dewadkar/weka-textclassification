                 My husband and I were looking for another car so our daughter could have the older one.  I really wanted a SUV, because they can hold a lot of cargo and are much better looking than the mini-vans. 

    We looked at the 2000 Kia Sportage and was seriously thinking about buying it.  I liked the way it drove even though it didn't have a lot of get up and go, but I really don't need to be a speed demon.  It was very roomy inside and I could see really well, which is important to me since I'm 5'1&quot;.  

     I let my daughter take over driving so I could see how it was to ride in the back seat.  The back seat is very roomy and I was beginning to enjoy the ride.  Then she turned a corner and I didn't like how it felt like it was going to tip over.  She turned the corner to go back into the dealership a little too fast and it really scared me.  So we didn't get the Kia Sportage.  

    I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this vehicle until they work out a way to overcome the problem of it feeling like it will tip over.<br><br>
