            Head bolt corrosion,  interior fills with water, Suspension system failure, new engine every 2000 miles.
Power window failure
Inept service from 2 dealers and one garage

The head bolts are too few and if pulled require a complete engine out remachine to fix.  Not a standard fix either.  Helicoils, even DOUBLE helicoils will not do for the Northstar.  It requires custom ~8" inserts to get the required pull down because there are not enough head bolts.  Mine pulled out near the waterpump after it had been into the dealer over 4 times with no lasting repair made.  After a $3000.00 dealer head bolt repair, the main bearings went.  It had 4 years and ~60,600 miles on it and Cadillac blew me off.  So sad too bad, your cash please.  Used engine with 19,000 miles installed and just replaced after 2000 miles of driving like there was an egg on the accelerator (didn't help).  Now have a 1999 engine in it and will unload for a real car as soon as possible.  Shocks are $1000 a corner.  I have removed the drain plugs under the rear seat as I bailed the STS more than my boat!  If the battery dies (when the dealer leaves the light on, thank you very much Belisle) the trunk cannot be closed without a boost!  The coolant requires leak stopping tablets.  The rear light fill with condensation. For my full story and the woes of others see http://members.rogers.com/gtrose/
Al Cline of Cadillac Engineering offered to make my opinion look "stupid" amongst other insults, but so far Cadillac has sent me their standard warrantee response.... Nothing.
The power window on the passenger side required 3 dissasemblies to bring it back to life, many times a well placed dose of precussive maintenance (HIT IT HARD) was all that was needed to avoid disassembly.

With a guilty conscience, I traded in this car and figure I lost ~$24,000 on it and got about 3500 km of driving. By the time I was able to drive it to the dealer for trade, it was on its FIFTH engine.  Even with that the Cadillac dealer said it would need ~$5,000 in engine reseal and parts and parts and parts.  

Deep pockets, proximity to dealership, patience, another vehicle to drive, a trailer to move it and a sense of humor are requirements for ownership.
