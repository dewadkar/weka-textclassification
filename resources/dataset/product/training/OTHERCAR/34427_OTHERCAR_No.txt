            I'm not a Saturn owner... and hopefully I never will be.  After the wreak that took the life from my VW Jetta (see my 2001 VW Jetta review for the whole story on that) I was given a white 2002 Saturn to drive (courtesy of Enterprise Rent-a-car and the evil woman's insurance company).  At first I was excited... some of my friends has Saturns and I had never driven one.  Saturn lovers really LOVE their cars, so I thought this would be great.

I've discovered that I hate this car.  Why?  Because:

1) The turning radius is worse than my boyfriend's pickup.  I can't get out of my driveway without a 3 point turn (which I never had to make, even in my parent's SUV)

2) The Steering wheel feels awful... I'm sure there is a technical name for this but basically it feels totally out of control.  I have to start turning way before I want to turn.  There is too much play in the wheel, and taking turns the car always feels like it's about to go out of control.

3) This car has no pickup.  Every morning I have to merge onto I75 and in this car I am actually terrified.  I floor it and by the end of the on ramp I'm only up to about 40mph which is not good in an area where the semi's are doing 70mph

4) The seats are VERY uncomfortable

5) The steering wheel doesn't adjust in the model I have

6) The seats are hard as heck to get into a comfortable angle

7) HUGE blind spots... I will never again drive next to a Saturn owner and expect them to know I am there.

8) Gas Guzzler:  I know I know, you say that they get great gas mileage, and compared to a Corvette they do.  Compared to a VW or my old Honda, this thing is eating me out of house and home.

9) Rattles... I don't know where they are coming from but there are a ton of them, especially at 43 mph.

I'm sure there are plenty of people who are very happy with their Saturn.  But after driving this rental car for 2 months I will never be a Saturn owner.  Many of these problems may be avoided by buying the more expensive model, but I wouldn't count on that.
