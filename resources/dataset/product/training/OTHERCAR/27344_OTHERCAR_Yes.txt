            OK, PLEASE DO NOT waste your money and buy this stupid truck/car.  This was a car I wish I never leased becasue it really is BAD.  I was looking for a car that held over 5 passengers and 4 wheel drive.  I checked out the DURANGO and the NAVIGATOR.  The DURANGO looked cool, it was nice and curvy.  IT held more than 5 passengers, and it was 4 wheel drive.  The price wasn't to0 bad, about $420.00 a month.  So I said why not.  
I get the car, and it was pretty cool at first.  It felt like I was riding on top of the world, because it was so high up.  But then, I got tired of it.  
The gas milage is horrible and the ride is very rough.  Don't belive it when people say its smooth, because its not.  It drives like a MACK truck.  The seating room is OK.  The back seats do not seat ADULTS.  Your legs get crammed then cramped if you are taller than 5 feet.  
The handling is not too good also.  When it rains, the DURANGO isn't a good car to drive at all.  Making turns is a dangerous task, if you don't know what your doing.  I've slipped several times while driving in the rain.  I don't know if it was my fault or not, but I'm not a crazy driver.  So other than that, thats about it for the DODGE durango.      <br><br>
