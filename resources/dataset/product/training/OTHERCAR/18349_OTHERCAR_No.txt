            Why I bought this vehicle I guess I'll truly never know exactly. I mean lets face it, the front end, if viewed from the correct position looks EXACTLY like a large <b> CATFISH!</b> Chrysler has had this same style on this car for way too long now, and its time for a change.  I also have a Ford Expedition and I prefer riding, driving, even racing the SUV more than this Sebring.  Don't get me wrong, if you're a new teen driver and you like the Sebring but cant have a convertible, get this car, the resale value isn't bad, but the exterior looks are.  The interior though on the other hand is quite exquisite and luxurious.  If you have a choice though, gets something other than this car.  A Ford Mustang has much better power, appearance, and reliability than this car.  The brakes have major problems, and turn the rims of your wheels black due to scrubbing.  The entire front end and rear end is made of a cheap plastic material, and the interior lights rarely work.  The fog lamps on this car is very convenient though driving those early morning hours.  They also require expensive, extra-wide tires, which are not any better than any other marketed tire.  <br><br>
