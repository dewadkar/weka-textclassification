            IMPORTANT: I DON'T own one of these units, but I got to use one the weekend before last. Spent most of the Friday night reading the manual, so that I knew where all of the important stuff was.

Executive summary:
-----------------
A good camera with an amazing list of features, but let down with poor tonal reproduction; polycarbonate - instead of glass - lens assembly (ewww); hit-n-miss saturation. "Dear Canon.... more megapixels DOES NOT equal better image quality...."

The dirt:
--------
Owners of any electronic product will generally bark on forever and a day about how grouse their product is. It's why sites like audioreview.com, epinions.com etc rarely have a bad thing to say about most products.

Having owned six digicams, and used countless others at work or ones owned by friends, I had a fair idea what to look for to make an objective assessment of the camera.

So....here's ONLY the dirt. I'll leave the "sun shines" stuff for the owners/retaikers of this model.


o Auto focus and zoom is SLOOOOOW. I would go as far to say that the old Sony FD71 is faster at focusing (and it had a bad reputation in that regard). The zoom lag is just plain annoying.

o RAW capture mode is rendered useless by the slow processing time. If RAW is important to you look elsewhere as on the G2 it will become painfull.

o Outdoor shots lack the deep saturation that can generally be seen from other Canon CCDs with LOWER resolutions (eg A20, A40)

o WTF is with the offset tripod mount? Idiots.

o LCD is very "soft" - useless for precise manual focusing.

o Red eye flash setting is relatively ineffective (too long between the pre-flash and flash)

o Heavy (bit of a beefer) but fragile feel. Already some stories going about regarding hairline cracks around the CF door. I'm surprised there hasn't been reports of cracking around the LCD hinging. 

o Unless you're photographing Asians or The Simpsons, skin tones are TERRIBLE. Orange hues become red. Greens favour blue. And so on.... All are fixable with a quick "auto levels" in Photoshop. But if you're paying almost $2K for a camera it SHOULD NOT be happening.
