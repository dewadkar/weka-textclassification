            Being almost 21, I ran down the stairs Christmas morning in 1999 to find Daddy holding off my small cousins, my 12-year-old sister, my 18-year-old brother and now me from sneaking into the living room to see how many presents we each had.

After 45 minutes worth of waiting in agony from all the suspense, he finally let us spill into the living room. After Mom and Auntie handed out most of the gifts, I started to realize that everyone including the dogs were getting more presents than I was. 

Now coming from a Christian family, I did not want to seem ungrateful or disappointed for they might take away the 3 or 4 gifts I did receive. So I sat back, watching everyone else (including the dogs) rip open their (what seemed now as an obsurd amount of) gifts, trying to look happy without crying too noticebly. 

The sound of the door bell was heard. Everyone (all 15 of them (again including the dogs) got up to answer it. They practically forced me as well. They were all smiling at me and some were even crying. &quot;What's going on??&quot; They weren't making any sense to me until I opened the door. 

There before my eyes was a Royal Blue (my favorite color) Saturn SL. I hadn't had a car in over a year and a half. I couldn't believe it!

It took me a while to learn how to drive a standard. But this little car I call &quot;Bulue&quot; has been wonderful...GREAT gas mileage, always bears with my terrible driving, hasn't failed me yet. Not to mention that the &quot;Saturn people&quot; are so precious and helpful.<br><br>
