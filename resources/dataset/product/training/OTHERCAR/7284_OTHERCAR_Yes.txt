            I bought this camera because I have always wanted a digital camera. I didn't want to spend too much money on it.
I did some research and found this one. It had all the features I wanted: Panorama, many flash types, self timer, zoom, and of course, an LCD screen.
I took this camera on my trip to Europe and was fascinated by how I could get such an accurate picture. I even discovered, that even in a pitch black room, if you have the flash on, the picture would come out as if the light was actually on.
About a quarter way into the trip, the batteries died and I had to replace them. I didn't even get a low battery warning. The batteries for this camera are expensive and extremely hard to find. You can either use 2 CR-70's at $15 a piece or 4 AA's for less. The CR-70's are only for this camera and one or two other Olympus cameras. Before the trip, I had to search for them at many stores. They are supposed to last a LOT longer than the AA's but I have not seen much of a difference.
I love the features that this has. For the price, there are many great features, including zoom. It also has an eye-catching design. I hate the battery problem, but nothing's perfect.
Anyone who likes new gadgets but doesn't want to spend a lot of money on expensive digital cameras with the same or fewer features should get this camera.<br><br>
