            The ML series from Mercedes was long awaited as the new SUV from Mercedes. As such most people expected that legendary Mercedes quality, dependability and safety features. Most of us are very disappointed. The quality and chose of materials are the first thing you notice as you get in the vehicle. Not the typical Mercedes choice maybe to keep price down or to make more money. For example the Hood isn't supported by the usual springs that all other Mercedes have (including the cheapest 190e and C230) and as such I doubt that many people will find it easy to open the hood. Also the choice of a support rod to keep it open seems out of place in a Mercedes. The build and paint quality also suggest that corners have been cut plastics abound and the trim level isn't what I have come to expect from Mercedes.
	The Truck? rides very well and performance is adequate. The build quality isn't
very good in the mechanical area either. Too many things keep braking from the plastic cup holders to the traction control little things needing repair
	I have heard that the 2000 models are very improved but that remains to be seen
	Maybe they just cant build them in Georgia like they can in Germany or maybe the don't want to
