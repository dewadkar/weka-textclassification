            I have a '95 GMC 4x4 extended cab and its pretty good.  It has a 5.7 engine and auto transmission.  I haven't really had many problems with it yet except I had to put a new transmission in.  That was kind of costly but its one of those things thats major and goes out first.  It had 130,000 miles on it when it happened so it was ready for it.  besides that nothing really has gone wrong with it.  Goes down the road pretty good, it likes to wander a little but thats because I wrecked it a few times.  Another problem with it is gas mileage, it only gets 12 miles a gallon when i'm driving it.  If the cruse control isn't on someone who probably get 15 mpg.  The '95 and '96 model year of GM trucks are the best in my opinion.  They have they have the better dash then the '94 and older ones and doesn't have the passenger side airbag like the '97 and '98 years had.  So with the dash you would have lots of room to put things and that is good.  The '97 and '98s aren't bad I just don't like looking at the passenger side airbag, but someday I'll have to update to one in the next year or two.  So if your looking for a good extended cab get a '95-'98 Chevy or GMC and you won't be sorry.  <br><br>
