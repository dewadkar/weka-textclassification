            Awesome Good Looks. Great handling with a firm, but smooth ride. Plenty of trunk space makes hauling all that valuable junk a breeze. Most people amazed at look of Gauge Cluster display at night.  It is in a cool blue.  I bought this car with my Heart, not my Mind.  Probably, many Japanese imports are a better value, but Life is more than nickels and dimes.  If you want to get noticed, I recommend the New Jetta. If you want to blend in, buy a Honda.
