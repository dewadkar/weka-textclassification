            I bought our 1996 Toyota Corolla in March of 1996. It now has 64,000 miles and feels as tight today as it did when it was new. We have had no major problems to date. I really do not expect any, as it is a Toyota. This is our first Toyota and we will most likely replace it with a Toyota. We need at least one reliable car as our second car is a 99 Dodge Ram PU that has many, many problems. Hind sight being 20/20, I should have spent the $2000 extra and purchased a new Tundra. Anyway, if you are looking for a great, reliable car, the Corolla is for you. Don't expect a lot of creature comforts as Toyota seems to put most of the manufacturing costs towards bullet proof mechanicals. You will get the main comforts such as cruise, tilt, power windows, power locks, great air conditioning and comfortable seats. The ride is firm but not harsh. The handling is very controlled. Power is from the bottom to the mid rpms. It likes to cruise in the 70 to 80 mph range giving very nice 28-32 mpg. The engine is smooth and oil changes are a snap. Timing belts need to be changed every 60,000 to 70,000 miles like most cars of this type. However, Toyota won't self destruct if the belt breaks. If you are a DIY type of person you will find that the car is easy to maintain. Our only complaint is the wind noise caused by the &quot;A&quot; pillar mounted antenna. Again a great little car.<br><br>
