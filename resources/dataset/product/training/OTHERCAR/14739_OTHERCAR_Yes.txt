            Let me start off by saying this: I LOVE my 1986 Honda Civic CRX.  It is beautiful and suits my needs!

Back in August I went to buy a used car.  I found the CRX through the auto trader online.  It was for sale by the owner and was supposed to be in great shape.  It looked like it was.  It drove like it was.  It was a great price.  So I bought it.  In less than a day I had fallen in love with my new car.  Let me also say that I have never loved a car before, but everyone seems to have one car that they will always remember and this is that car for me.  I quickly became the car owner I never thought I would be, washing and waxing it twice a week and showing it off to my family and friends.  I finally understood how people could spend so much money on their cars.

But then things got rocky.  After owning the car for only three weeks, it broke down.  I was devastated and I knew I could not afford to buy another car that soon.  So, when my mechanic suggested fixing it up, I decided to invest the $1,200.  I received an engine from a 1987 CRX in place of the faulty engine that had come with mine.  I was nervous, but happy when I got my car back.  I am happy to report that I have had nothing but minor problems since.

What are the pro's of owning this car?  They are dependable, (when taken care of properly-pay attention to the owner's manual when it says NOT to put regular old gasoline in the car)beautiful, stylistic, perfect for small parking spaces and very fast(it's wonderful when you are late for work).  It starts everyday (but sometimes it takes a few tries) and you will probably experience at least a day or two where you just flat out feel cool because you are driving one.  Also, they handle remarkably well for a car that does not have power steering.  I drive it on the freeway five days a week, 85 miles roundtrip and it has never let me down.

The con's?  It squeaks, whenever it feels that it is cold.  And let me tell you, this car always thinks it's cold.  If it's true that cars can have a personality, then this car believes it is better than every other car.  I have to put a quart of oil in my car every two to three weeks.  It doesn't handle very well in the snow (or heavy rain, for that matter).
All in all, though, I have been very pleased with my CRX.  When it comes time to buy a new car, I will most likely buy a Honda.

If you are looking for a used car and a CRX is in your price range you should consider it.  Just get it checked over first and be sure to maintain it regularly and it shouldn't let you down.


                              *UPDATE*
I just wanted to mention that the other morning it was -10 below here (that's before the windchill which I don't even want to talk about) and my CRX responded well.  It only took two tries to start and it handled just fine throughout the day.
