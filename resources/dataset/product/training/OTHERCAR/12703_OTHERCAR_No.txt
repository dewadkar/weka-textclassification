            Two years ago I purchased a brand new 1997 Chevy Cavalier Rally Sport.  Since that time owning this car has been a nightmare!  I have had the sunroof replaced 4 times, the stereo twice, and the ignition 4 times as well.  

Although the dealership I have been going to for repairs is doing their best, there are just too many things wrong with this car.  Because of faulty parts that GM installed I have been left waiting for tow trucks three times in the last year.  

The Cavalier does get great gas mileage, but the amount I save will nowhere near equal the amount I've had to put into repairs.  I don't often like to say this about a product, but this car is a terrible piece of machinery.<br><br>
