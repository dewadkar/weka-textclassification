            If you're looking for a vehicle with cargo capacity and you're not quite in need of a full-blown SUV, an extended-cab or king-cab truck might be the thing you're looking for, particularly as a second or third vehicle. I was late in coming to the realization that a vehicle like the Frontier would be perfect for me, but I did and it is. It's comfortable for commuting and it's absolutely essential for those trips to Home Depot. The neighbors were very jealous when I brought home a couple of Bradford pear trees in my new 2000 Frontier.

My truck (2000 Frontier King Cab, 2WD, 4-cylinder engine) is only a few months old now, and I'm extremely happy with its performance. I'm certainly not an expert on the technical specifics of the vehicle, but I can tell you that it has a comfortable ride, sips gasoline, and 'feels' very solidly built. It reminds me a lot of a 1995 Pathfinder I used to own; both vehicles seem exceptionally sturdy and reliable.

The king cab is far more comfortable for both the driver and front-seat passenger than would be a truck without, and appears to be rapidly becoming a standard for light trucks. The truck has two taxicab style jump seats in the back, which are all but useless as far as I can tell (there is a crewcab version with a full set of back doors and a back seats). My Frontier came equipped with a bedliner, as well as a switch to disable the passenger-side airbag, which is a handy feature if you're seating a child there.

My gas mileage has been stellar, 28-29 miles per gallon 'in the city', and I've encountered no mechanical problems yet (I'm still under 3000 miles). Although reasonably priced, nothing about the vehicle feels cheap or poorly constructed. All-in-all, a very nice vehicle for anyone needing a light truck or for a single person considering an SUV-type vehicle (and its cargo space) who doesn't want to shell out a boatload of money, particularly for a row (or two) of seats that won't be used.

The Frontier is also a good-looking truck (whatever that means), with a very nice trim package and alloy wheels.

Enjoy...<br><br>
