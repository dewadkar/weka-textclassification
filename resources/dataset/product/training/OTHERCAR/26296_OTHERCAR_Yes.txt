            Last Month I had the opportunity to drive my 00ï¿½ Civic Si at Big Willow Raceway in Rosamond CA, driving on a professional racetrack is a good way to learn the limits of a car.  I bought the Si because I was interested in track racing and decided that it could serve as my daily driver as well as an occasional racecar.  The track was rented by an organization called Open Track and for about $200 they let me drive in their run groups for the weekend.  This was my first time driving my unmodified Si on a track and I was a bit nervous.  

I had been driving the Si on the streets for a while it began to feel like a regular civic.  The only time I was able to appreciate the extra money I kicked down for the Si model was on freeway onramps in Vtech when the engine would rev above 6000 rpms.  Driving the Si on the racetrack allowed me to appreciate the Vtech and high horse power that the car had in its upper power band.

My first time on the track with the car began slowly.  I wanted to get a feel for the track and learn the proper lines.  When the second run group came around I began feeling comfortable with the car and began pushing it more.  Every shift I made was at redline, I began to see what the vtech was all about.  If I upshifted to early or downshifted to late the car would fall out of vtech and loose much of its acceleration.  The short gearing and narrow power band offered by the Si disappointed me.  These features required that I constantly shift, which often times distracted me from taking the proper line around the track.  When I did manage to keep up with the shifting the results were extremely pleasing and a smile never came off my face.

Handling was extremely predictable.  To my surprise the stock tires gripped extremely well around the 80+ mph sweeper that led to the back straight.  I did manage to go beyond the handling limits of the car through a few corners. When this happened the car reacted by under steering to the outside of the corner.  I noticed that keeping my foot planted on the gas while exiting a corner helped keep a solid line.  Backing off the throttle while exiting a corner caused the rear end to become unsettled.  I managed to scare myself on a couple occasions by lifting the throttle while exiting, but I eventually learned that keeping the throttle planted was the best idea even though it felt counter intuitive.

My experience with the Si on a professional track changed my view of the car.  I am now able to appreciate the added features of Vtech and the sport tuned suspension.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is on a tight budget and does not want to compromise performance.
