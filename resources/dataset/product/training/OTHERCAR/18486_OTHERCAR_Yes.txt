               I bought a 1993 Dodge Dakota Club Cab from Courts Auto in Milton, WV back in 1993. It came with the 3.9lt V-6, air, am/fm cassette and cruise control. The jump seats in the back are awesome for my now 7 year old son. There is actually a little storage compartment under the jumpseat behind the drivers side and the jack under the passenger side jumpseat. 

   There is PLENTY of room in this truck let me tell you. I am 6'6&quot; and 375lbs. Trust me when I tell you I have plenty of room in the cab. Keep in mind however that I've never ridden in the jumpseats. ;) I put a nice fiberglass topper on the bed and find that it is very roomy for my needs. 
   
   It has, BY FAR, been the single most reliable automobile I have ever owned. During the 120,000 miles I have put on this truck I've had to replace a water pump and the front brake rotors. That's it!

   The only real problem I've had with this truck is that the paint (dark metallic blue) seems to be &quot;flaking&quot; off slowly on the hood and roof. I have read that this is due to the type of blue paint that Dodge used in the late 80's and early 90's. This problem has since been corrected I am told. I took my truck to the dealer where I purchased it and told him about this problem several years ago and he repainted those areas at no charge to me. :)

   With this V-6 it has plenty of zip and hauling capacity. I opted for the V-6 due to economic reasons and have been very pleased with my choice. I average about 20 mpg and that includes about half highway and half city driving.

   I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone looking for a reliable vehicle. It's good for a family with a small child or two. My father-in-law was so impressed that I liked mine so much that he went out and bought one and loves his!<br><br>
