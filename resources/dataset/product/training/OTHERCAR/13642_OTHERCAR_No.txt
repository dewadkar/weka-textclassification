                 I bought my Kia Sportage in the summer of 1998.  I now refer to this as &quot;The Dark Time&quot;.  Shortly after I bought it, I started having problems with the air conditioning.  It seems that the hotter it got, the weaker the air conditioning got.  Then it failed all together.  I made an appointment at the dealership to get the problem fixed and as I waited, more problems began to arise.  The car had extremely poor pick up, brakes that squealed like a pig on slaughter day and little to no power when you needed it most (you know like driving on the road).
     A short time after the &quot;repairs&quot; the same problems surfaced again.  Being the second time I was back for the same problems, I insisted on a rental car.  You would have thought I was asking for their first born children.  After  talking to three different &quot;supervisors&quot; I was able to get a car.  It was a good thing too since this set of repairs took 3 days. But with these repairs done, I was back in my Kia and back on the road though not for long.
     I was driving down the road one day when I heard a horrible whining from the front of the car.  This was followed shortly thereafter by a loud bang from under the hood, a big puff of smoke and the smell of burning rubber.  Did I mention I was on a busy highway with my 2 year old son at the time?  I pulled over and couldn't figure out what had happened.  That's when I realized that the air conditioning had gone out, this time with a bang.
     Needless to say this meant yet another trip to the dealer.  I called Kia before hand to complain and was given the name of their regional representative at that dealership.  When I dropped the car off, I went to speak with their rep. and was after a lot of complaining was told that he had cars in the shop that cost over $35,000 (not Kias obviously) and didn't work so I should be happy I didn't have one of them.  Now that's customer service!
     So far the air conditioning has held out (maybe fourth time is the charm).  Of course now the check engine light is on more than it's off and the doorlocks are possessed by the devil, locking and unlocking at will.  
     This is by far the worst car I have ever owned and my first car was a Gremlin.  If I could afford to trade this &quot;car&quot; in now i would.  However, since that is not the case, as soon as it is paid off it is going far away from me.  So in summation let me say Kia; JUST SAY NO!!!!!!<br><br>
