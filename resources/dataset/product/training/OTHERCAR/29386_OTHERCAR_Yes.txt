            I love the Toyota Avalon.  It has everything I could ever want in a car, smooth ride, roomy(front and back), good acceleration.  I lease this car because it is the best value for a mid-sized sedan out there.  My Avalon is '99.  The 2000 Avalons look 10 times better, I still like mine but now seeing the new ones, I would have rather waited to get a 2000.  The car goes from 0-60 in 8.8 seconds, which is amazing for a mid-sized sedan.  And with this acceleration, is a smooth ride.  A smooth ride is necessary for a car because then it is easier to concentrate on the road.  The car is also suprisingly quiet.  The only problem I have had so far is with my suspension.  The car has been creaking, and when I recently brought it in to the shop, they said it needs a new suspension.  The good thing is that it is under warranty.  Overall, the Toyota Avalon has treated me well and is extremely reliable.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a id-sized sedan at a great value.  <br><br>
