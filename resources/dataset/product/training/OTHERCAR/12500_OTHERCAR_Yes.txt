            My father gave me his Saab 9000 turbo a couple of years ago when he bought a new car. At first I was ungrateful and thought the 10 year old car was a peice of crap, but after driving it for 25,000 miles my initial concerns were proven wrong. My Saab's turbo engine has given me the best pickup, the leather seats are still as comfortable as they were, and the steering and brakes on my car prove even better then other brands of newer models. After 10 years of excellent service, I must conclude that my father's purchase of our Saab was one of my family's best investments. The stero's sound might not be as crisp as it once was, and the ceiling might be falling down a tad, but the car's spirit is as strong as ever! The only vice to owning a Saab is that after all these years the repairs for it have gotten to be expensive.  <br><br>
