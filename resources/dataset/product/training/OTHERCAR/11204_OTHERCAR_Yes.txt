                 Some say that it takes a village to raise a child. With two children, I say that it takes a Villager. It is well designed, is
easy to drive, and easy for the short do-it-yourselfer to maintain.
This van is comfortable for both the driver and passengers. There are good sight lines for the vertically challenged (formerly known as &quot;petite&quot;) as well as those six-foot plus men in our lives, and the 
seats and mirrors adjust rapidly when the driving is traded off.
The kids (aka passengers) can easily and safely open and close the
doors themselves unless you use the child locks. They can also correctly
belt themselves without assistance. Yes!  It is simple to drive, all
the bells and whistles are in the expected places, and the pickup is
sufficient for the crazy driving on the Washington and Baltimore area
freeways.  Unlike my previous van, the Villager's under the hood space
is laid out well, so that not only can you see the battery, but you
can reach it with a jumper cable. Even those of us with short arms
can reach the dipstick and the caps for replacing oil, washer fluid, etc.
Okay, so the Villager isn't all that attractive, it isn't &quot;cool&quot;, and 
you won't turn any heads. That's okay. I'm busy raising my children and
using my Villager to do it.
