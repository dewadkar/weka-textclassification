            This digital camera is an impressive-looking piece of equipment.  It almost resembles a video camera (although it doesn't have quite the same capabilities).  But it's relatively easy to learn how to use. 

If you're going to purchase this camera, my strong recommendation is that you take about half an hour and sit down and read the directions in their entirety.  Otherwise, a lot of the neat capabilities will simply be lost on you.  
That's how it was with me anyway. 

This camera has an LCD screen about an inch by two inches that, like a video camera, captures the exact motion and movement and image of what's going on within the range of the lens.  Right of the bat, you have a pretty good idea of what your pictures are going to look like.  After you've taken them, you can immediately view the frozen shot in your LCD screen. 

There are a few really neat features of this camera too.  For instance, you can choose the "multi" recording function.  This takes subsequent shots about a second apart as you're pointing the camera, so that you can capture images and play them back as if they were a slide show.    

Further there are four different types of effects you can choose from.  For instance, you can take black and white photos or photos that look more like illustrations.  

There are a number of different program settings to choose from.  For example:  Choose "Beach and Ski" if you're taking pictures in very bright light.  Or "Sunset and Moon" for pictures in darker settings.

I really like this camera and find it user friendly (once you know what all the different little icons and letters on the LCD screen mean) and fun. 

The quality of the photographs it takes is very impressive.  It picks up even slight details.  I took a shot of my cat, for example, and it really picked up the texture of his fur, even though he was standing slightly in a shado.  These photos can be printed out on regular paper.  However, if they are printed out on special photographic paper--which costs a little more but is easily available at places such as K-mart or any camera or computer store--they can look like professionally developed photographs.  Which is great!

I know of at least a couple of other people who have tried this photograph and loved it!  They said they didn't want to stop using it and wanted to take pictures of everything.

One drawback is that the battery life seems so short.  I was just barely learning how to use the camera when all of the sudden I had to stop and recharge the battery.  Just taking straight shots should help add to the life, but that's not a helpful pointer if you want to experiment.

The pictures are all saved to floppy disk and can be copied straight from the camera onto several disks.  They can also easily be erased by using the delete function on the camera's menu to save disk space.
