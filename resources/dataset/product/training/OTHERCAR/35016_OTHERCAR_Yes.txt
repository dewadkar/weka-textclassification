            My wife and I recently purchased a small truck.  We didn�t really need a small truck, but we have found reasons to use it.  We wanted something a little safer than the Toyota Tercel that she was driving.  We researched immaculately, including right here on epinions.  For our meager budget, the 1998 Isuzu Hombre seemed the best choice.

The main concern for this truck is power.  It used to be the case that people bought trucks to haul heavy trailers or loads.  The recent trend has been to buy a truck for its looks.  Following the recent trend, the Hombre does just fine.  But, if you are buying this thing to haul stuff with, think again.  This little four-banger can barely move itself, especially with the AC on.  Pulling out into traffic can be hazardous.  It really doesn�t seem to have anything to it.  Higher, more expensive,  trimlines offer a V6 that is supposed to be outstanding.

Another sore spot is the interior.  Although the seats themselves are comfortable, the leg-room for passengers is minimal, and you can just plain forget trying to ride three people in the front.  For some reason, Isuzu designed this thing with a huge dash that is obtrusive and annoying to ride behind, especially if the driver has short legs and needs to pull the seat forward.  There is this thing called Space-Cab, which is supposed to solve the room issue, but that too comes with a more expensive trimline.

The one place that really shines with this truck is the transmission.  Our particular model is a 5-speed manual, and shifts like the wind.  Shifting is so smooth that you don�t even have to try to shift the gears.  I really like that.  The power steering is also quite nice.  I feel like I could weave a basket through traffic with the use of my pinkie finger if I had to, though I never would of course.

The Hombre rides like a truck, which is to say rough.  This can�t really be held against it, as that is the general suspension of a truck.  Night driving seems okay.  The headlights seem to be pointed straight.  I�ve driven some trucks that might as well have had no headlights at all.  I don�t fore-see any problems with the truck.  The engine compartment seems to be pretty well thought out.  Changing the oil isn�t too big a deal with this truck.

Overall the Hombre is fun to drive, easy to maintain, and seems pretty sound.  The price was right for us, and that is primarily why we bought it.  Just make sure and test drive one pretty thoroughly and test the power.  It may be sufficient for you, it may not.  The gas mileage is not great (low 20�s), but for a truck it is reasonable. With good looks, no power, it being easy to drive, and with decent fuel economy, this would  make a great first vehicle for that teenager of yours.
