            I decided to buy this vehicle originally because of the name.  My family gave me high recommendations with the Mazda name.  I researched several web sites offering information about safety, gas mileage, and standard features for different cars of this class.  For economy cars, this car was was built better than some of the other cars that I had test drove.  I compared this car to the Honda Civic.

I received a much better price and it had more features that came standard with the car.  I also compared this car to the Chevrolet Cavalier.  This car rode smoother on the rode and didn't feel as cheap.  Also, Mazda offers incentives for college graduates and I got $1000 off in addition to the $500 rebate that was offered.

I was also able to finance my car for 3.9% through Mazda Credit.  I decided to buy a manual drive and my gas mileage runs from 33 to 40 miles to the gallon.  This car feels like your are driving a much more expensive car.  The ride is so smooth that you wouldn't even know that it was a stick shift.

I thought that I had accidentally driven the Mazda 626 or 929.  This car also rated better than the 626 because it was more roomy and comfortable.  I love the fact that people actually come up to me and ask me what kind of car this is and say things like &quot;that is a good looking car&quot;.  I love the color that I bought which is called Sandalwood.  I also love the fact that I got such a good deal for all of the features that I received.

Any first time car buyer should buy a Mazda Protege because you'll never want another car.  If you are to ever want another car, you'll upgrade to the 626, 929, or the Millennium.  Those who have a larger family would not like this car because it is considered a compact car.  So, this is geared toward the single person or the newlyweds.
