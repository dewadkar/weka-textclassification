            I have been driving my fathers Lincoln Town cars for 10 years. He gets the newest one each year and I've made sure to borrow it whenever I can. This car is a hovercraft. You cant feel a bump in the road. And belive me New Orleans constantly sinking terrain is full of bumps and holes.

What can I say? The car is perfect. It lets you know when you are getting low on gas, it lets you know the outside temperature. It has a bose stereo system inside, or if you prefer no stereo, it's able to block out the rest of the world with bullet proof glass. The breaks are fantastic. It handles like a dream. And the acceleration makes you feel like you are warping to light speed! Its comfortable, you could live in the car! And its safe.

My personal goal in life is to be able to afford one of these machines.

The only cons are dont lock your keys in the car because nothing short of an explosive can break or jimmy through the glass. But hey- at least you know no one else can get in.<br><br>
