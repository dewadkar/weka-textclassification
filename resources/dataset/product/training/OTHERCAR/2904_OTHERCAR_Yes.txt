            In short

The 2002 RSX is a brand new vehicle 
from Honda's luxury division, replacing 
the outdated Integra with a whole
new level of rigidity and refinement.
It is a sporty mix of technology
and components from Honda's worldwide
parts bin.  The structure and 
suspension borrow from the Civic, the
engine screams Honda S2000, but the
accoutrements remind you it's a more
luxurious Acura

Fun, Stylish, and fast....

Acura's new RSX models have an overall
length of approximately 172 inches
, a height of almost 55 inches, and a
curb weight of approximately 2700 lb.
It has a front engine, front wheel drive,
and is available only as a two-door 
fastback, which is a convenient hatch.
The RSX comes in two models: a base 
model availablewith a five-speed 
automatic and five-speed manual that
putsout 160 horsepower from a 2-liter,
4-cylinder engine, and a Type S model
that puts out 200 horsepower and comes
only with a six-speed manual transmission.
As you walk toward the RSX you will 
immediately notice it has a distinctive
front end as well as the Honda/Acura
family resemblance.  On the outside,
the Type S looks different, but under
the hood and on the interior you can
tell the difference. The base model is
a fine vehicle, if you want to stick
with a lower price tag.

Luxurious Interior

Richly textured interior pleasing to
the fingertips. Climate control knobs
are large, clear, and easy to adjust.
Bose/Acura entertainment system 
includes a dash-mounted six-disk
changer and a casette for convenience.

Sophisticated Drive

Driver's car with cockpit feel. 
Gauges and dashboard have silver
metallic color which lends a sporty
practical feel. Plenty of seating
room. Good airflow, good sound
system, and overall controls
with a tachometer that has a 8000
RPM redline and a six-speed gearbox
that makes driving the car fun. 
New rack and pinion design makes
the car directionally stable, even
in heavy rain or snow.
