            I really like corvettes, in our area it is the rage. Older models seem to be stealing the spotlight though. I believe this is because of the downturn in the economy. , because the new style is very eye catching. I recently purchased a 1979 Chevrolet corvette. I find the frame in great condition as well as most of the rest of the car. I have spent an minimal amount of money on this  vehicle. You must be sure to know the car you are buying though. Don't be afraid to ask questions even of the neighbors or friends of the previous owner. <br><br>
