            I bought my 1990 Honda Accord brand new and put 175,000 miles on it.  Then, I gave it to my son when I bought a 1996 Honda Accord and he is still driving the 1990!  Anyway, back in 1990 I had researched &quot;Consumer's Reports Magazine.&quot; They reported that the 4-cylinder, 5-speed Honda Accord for 1990 was actually faster than the Camry V6--and it got better gas mileage!  

1990 was the first year for the Honda 4-valves-per-cylinder engine.  My son now has 255,000 on the car and the A/C has never needed service!  The original muffler last 200,000 miles, the alternator 237,000!  (We replaced it with a re-built unit for around $150.00--doing the work ourselves.)

At 110,000 miles the 1990 car died with an ignition problem.  The Honda dealer fixed it for $150.00.  Three months later I got a letter from Honda informing me that some of their ignitions were not up to Honda standards and if I'd had any work done on mine, I should bring in the receipt for a full refund.  I did, and promptly got a check from Honda for the $150.00.  The letter went on to say I should bring the car in and they would install a new distributor--also for free!  

I routinely got over 400 miles to a tank of gas.  The car handles very well, it started in all the cold Wisconsin winters and after 11 years still has very little rust.  The Honda Accord has been among the top ten cars in �Car and Driver� magazine for over ten years.

I keep buying new ones and encouraging friends to do the same!  Everyone I know who buys a Honda (or, their luxury line, the Acura) reports similar great service from these high quality cars.  The US government just picked the Honda Accord as the best performer in their roll-over statistics (least likely to roll-over and fewest deaths when it does).  Unlike top-heavy Sport-Ute�s, the Honda Accord is low to the ground, corners very well and provides great �road feel.� 

There are very few things I don't like about my 1999 Honda Accord.  One is they changed the wipers that year to turn on whenever you use the washers.  This does not work very well in our snowy, sloppy mid-western winters.  It wastes washer fluid and it doesn't clean the windshield, because the wipers turn on before the fluid has had a chance to soak into the dirt.  Previous Accords allowed you to squirt the washers until you had saturated the windshield.  Then, you could manually turn on the wipers.  The approach used in the 1999 model might be OK in California, but not for the muddy mid-west!

Also, for 1990 the Accord went back to break-away side mirrors.  They are noisier at highway speeds than the non-break-away style used in the mid-1990's.  Also, even though the 1999 Accord is larger than the 1990, I'm still getting over 400 miles to a tank full of gas--on the highway.
