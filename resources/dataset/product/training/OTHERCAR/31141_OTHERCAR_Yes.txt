            <b>FIRST IMPRESSIONS:</b>
The first time I had the chance to drive one was in the summer of 1992.  I just graduated from high school and found a summer job at Acura of Portland as an assistant mechanic.  It was great.  I was able to drive pretty much all the new and used cars during the time.  The first day on the job required me to take a brand new black 1992 <b>Acura NSX</b> to the Acura dealership in Salem (about 100 miles round-trip) and bring back a red NSX.  I was stoked!  So, basically, the first Acura I ever drove was a 1992 NSX that had a whopping 6 miles on it!

The design of the NSX hasn't changed over the years.  Just really minor cosmetic details inside and out and the addition of a removable top version.  The looks of the sporty NSX will win you over in an instant.  I was amazed at how low it sat on the ground.  Sitting in the cockpit was almost like sitting on the floor.  The mid-engine/rear-wheel drive configuration and the two-seat capacity gives you the aesthetic feel of a true race car.

<b>FEATURES:</b>
The Acura NSX comes standard with many features.  If you're looking into buying the NSX with an automatic transmission, you'll be getting the 3.0-liter V6 that only pushes out 252 horses, compared to the manual transmission that is equipped with a 3.2-liter V6 that puts out 290 horses.  C'mon, if you're paying over $80K for a car, it better come with pretty much everything as standard, right?!

<b>THE DRIVE:</b>
When sitting in the Acura NSX, you feel like a king.  The instrument panel is well placed and the seats are as supportive as a wonderbra.  The fit &amp; finish of this vehicle is amazing.  But after looking at the sticker price, you'll wonder why it doesn't come with 24K gold accents or with a lifetime supply of free gasoline.  For a two-seater, it has lots of room to store the essentials (tapes, CDs, sunglasses, a snack, etc.)... no golf bag, though.  

Getting out of steep driveways is a task in itself.  I didn't want to scrape the front spoiler, so I had to perform a <i>diagonal launch maneuver</i>.  Once on the road, it was a joy cruising down the street having almost everyone do a double-take.  Blasting off on the freeway onramp brought a smile to my face as I was at 65 MPH in no time flat.  The cruise to Salem was a piece of cake.  Driving back in the red NSX was just as fun.    

Third and fourth gear seemed to be, by far, the most exciting.  I was able to maximize the power and pull of the car at around 70 MPH ***<i>I highly recommend obeying all traffic laws and driving the speed limit</i>*** and the NSX was thirsting for more.  The ride is very solid and the handling is very responsive and crisp.  There's really nothing more I can write in this review, as you'll need to actually take one out for yourself.  The saying, <i>&quot;let the car speak for itself&quot;</i> applies here. 

<b>SIZE:</b>
It's built for two, and that's about it.  C'mon, don't expect to cram the whole family in the NSX.  After all, I don't think they designed the NSX for families.  Acura has the Integra, TL, and RL for that.  The NSX is designed for speed and performance, and it does just that.  The driver and the passenger will ride in comfort and there's even space for a handbag here and there, as well.  

<b>WARRANTY:</b>
The NSX comes with a <b>4-year/50,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty</b>, <b>4-year/50,000 mile drivetrain warranty</b>, <b>4-year/unlimited mile roadside assistance</b>, and <b>5-year/unlimited mile rust/corrosion warranty</b>.  

<b>FUEL ECONOMY:</b>
For a sports car, the NSX get pretty good gas mileage.  The <b>3.2-liter</b> (manual transmission) gets an average of <b>17 MPG in the city</b> and <b>24 MPG on the highway</b>.  The <b>3.0-liter</b> (automatic transmission) gets an average of <b>16 MPG in the city</b> and <b>24 MPG on the highway</b>.

<b>SUMMARY:</b>
Weighing in at a hefty $80,000+, the NSX isn't what you would call <i>affordable</i>.  It's a fine piece of machinery, but I wouldn't run out there to buy one even if I had the cash to spare.  There are too many other fine automobiles that sell for much less.  If you really want to purchase an Acura NSX, I'd recommend buying a used one.  From time to time, I keep in touch with the Acura mechanics I worked with, and they say the NSX is way overpriced, too.  They all agree that it's a precision-crafted vehicle that deserves more recognition, though.

Acura does have a great thing going here.  The NSX is quite possibly one of the few perfectly-made, street-legal sports cars on the market today.  Since its introduction in 1991, the design hasn't changed... which goes with the saying, &quot;<i>...why change something that's already perfect?</i>&quot;   <br><br>
