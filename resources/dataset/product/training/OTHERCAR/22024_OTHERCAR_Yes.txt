            My spouse and I bought a 1993 Grand Prix LE last November.  This was a used car we bought from a guy who only drove it six months out of the year.  I am very satisfied with this car.  The seating is comfortable, it is fairly good on gas, we have not had to make any repairs since we bought it.  It features air conditioning, moon roof, front wheel drive, power windows and has great suspension.  The ride is smooth and it handles well. The only complaint I have about this car is that when it is raining if you open the window rain comes in makes the interior damp this is nothing that can't be fixed by getting window guards from your local Canadian tire.  We paid 6000.00 Canadian for this car and I am happy with the over all performance, it has a sporty look, room for five with comfort, the seats in the front wrap around you making this a comfortable car for long rides.  It has a great sound system as well.  Comes with a AM/FM radio and tape deck.  Console is in the middle of the two front seats.  This took some time in getting used to as my previous car didn't have this.  I would buy another Grand Prix because they are reliable and comfortable.  They have a V6 engine and enough power for me.
