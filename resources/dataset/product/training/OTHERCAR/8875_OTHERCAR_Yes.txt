            We bought this vehicle to replace a 1990 Ford Escort that was totalled in an accident.  I wanted a small dependable vehicle for my wife that was reasonably priced and got good gas mileage.  The Subaru Justy was all these things.  We got lucky and bought a 1991 Subaru Justy GL ECVT (automatic transmission).  My wife loves the car and the automatic transmission gets the same fuel economy that the 5-speed does.  NOTE TO AUTOMATIC TRANS OWNERS (ECVT ONLY) - Subaru recommends that you change the auto trans fluid every 15,000 miles.  Changing the auto transmission fluid is very easy to do and much cheaper than at a garage.  Fuel economy after 55,000 miles is approximately 36 mpg (highway) and 30 mpg (city).  GREAT VEHICLE - VERY DEPENDABLE - RECOMMENDED.<br><br>
