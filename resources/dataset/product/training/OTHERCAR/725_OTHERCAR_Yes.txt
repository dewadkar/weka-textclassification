            I have been a fan of having fun on the road my whole life.  And boy can I enjoy myself when I am cruising around town in my 1997 Eclipse GS.  The gust of wind in my face brings be back to my high school days cruising around at breakneck speeds.  This car makes the best use out of 4 cylinders that I have seen in a sport-compact car.  Its all-disc break system make it a snap to stop on a dime, and the optional leather seating makes long trips a delight.  I would recommend this automobile to anyone looking for a little pep in their driving experience.<br><br>
