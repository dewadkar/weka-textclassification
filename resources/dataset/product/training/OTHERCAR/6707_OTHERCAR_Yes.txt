            <b>Bought used, but great car</b>
I purchased my car two years ago with 60,000 miles already on it.  The car was originally my sister&#146s car and was well maintained by the large corporation she worked for.  My sister received a new company car and sold me this one.  She always said the 1997 Lumina was better then the new company car that replaced it which actually cost a lot more and was 2 model years younger.  

<b>impressed with power</b>
I was immediately impressed with the 1997 Lumina's power and still feel it has a great deal of power when needed.  I learned early, that the 1997 Lumina is a good coaster due to it's overdrive, and often take my foot off the gas well before needing to stop.  

<b>Tall drivers will be cramped, but average size perfect</b>
I'm an average size person and find the car roomy.  In addition, it has a large trunk.  However, I noticed the car is less roomy for larger people.  I used to take some men I worked with out to lunch and they were roughly 6'1" -6'2" inches tall and muscular.  They seemed much more cramped in the car then I expected.  On the other hand, they seemed even more cramped in the cars and vehicles they drove to work. So, go figure?  If you are over 6' tall or will regularly have tall people in the car, then be sure and test the leg room in the Lumina before buying.  Anyone else will have plenty of room and comfort with the 1997 Lumina.

<b>Dependable but seats uncomfortable</b>
The vehicle has served me well and has been dependable.  It rides quietly, and there isn't much road noise even on the highway.  That is a plus if you are commuting an hour to work.  In addition, the ride seems on the soft side and that is good too. The seats are okay for short trips and I'm okay with them, but two of my family members absolutely hate the cushioning of the seats.  I put seat comfort out of my mind, but they continue to let me know how uncomfortable the seats are.  I think that is kind of rude since there is little I can do about the seats.  After hearing enough complaints, I offered one family member a pillow to sit on during a long drive, but they refused to use it.

<b>Few repairs needed</b>
I've had few repair needs for the car, however they were on the expensive side when they came up.  Some problems I had repaired but when I was informed the ABS brakes weren't working and would cost $1300 to repair I passed on the repair.  The ABS braking system automatically turns itself off when there is a problem and the car just uses regular braking without ABS so there isn't a hazard.  In fact a mechanicly inclined friend of mine said  $1300 is too much to sink into this cars ABS brakes especially since he has read that in most situations non-ABS brakes are just as good or better then with the ABS system working.

<b>Auto sensing headlights</b>
I like not having to bother turning on the lights on the car as the Lumina takes care of that for me, switching from running lights to headlights when it gets dark outside or going in and out of tunnels etc.  On the other hand, I wish there were a way to turn the lights off too.  Other than parking the car and setting the parking brake, it is impossible to run the engine with the headlights off.  There is a rare occasion when more control is needed.

<b>Drive car on highway to test steering</b>
Finally, I've always noticed a slight looseness in the  cars steering. It is a small thing but at highway speeds the car tends to drift a little. I would recommend before buying a car that you test how the car travels and whether there is a lot of steering adjustment required.  I even had the vehicle adjusted at a tire dealership but it didn't totally eliminate the problem.  This isn't a bad problem at all, but if there is something I would want improved on the car, it would be to tighten up the steering just a little.


<b>1997 Lumina Update November 2003 - 115,000 miles</b>
Since I wrote my review, my car has continued to run great.  I've had few problems, although I put two tires on the front and had to flush the cooling system. Both normal maintenance items.  However, I just had to put a new shifting cable into the car at a cost just under $300.  That was unexpected, but when it got hard to shift gears on a cold day, I knew something was wrong.  It shifts great now and seems to be better then before.  Overall, I still think it is a very dependable car with low maintenance costs.  My car is now at 115,000 miles and going strong. AC works, no oil leaks etc.
