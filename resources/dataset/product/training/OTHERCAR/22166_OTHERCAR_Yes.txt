            I got this car when I was in college because I liked how it drove and it was inexpensive enough that I could make the car payments.

It has done just that.  Any rational person should know by looking at the price that it's not going to drive like a Bonneville, or an Explorer or even a Taurus.  It's not made to do that.  It's made to be safe and inexpensive.  I have had very few problems with it- the blower on the heater stopped working and the starter went out.  Both problems were far less to fix than the difference I would be paying had I bought any of the other cars I looked at.  

After 4 1/2 years and almost paid off, I know I'll be able to go a few years without car payments and very few problems.  The car is big enough to fit 4 adults comfortably and 5 fairly easily.  Trunk space has never been a problem.  I mean, it's not a minivan, but that's not what I'm looking for.

The biggest problem has been the touchy accelerator and even that is only a problem when I let other people drive my car.  It is pretty easy to adjust to and has never made me fear for my safety.
