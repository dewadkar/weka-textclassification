            This is our third vanagon. Our first was a air-cooled 1980 vanagon. That was a nice van, loved all the space. We sold that, two children and 2 years later we finally found my dream vanagon.
We call it the Silver Bullet. It is a 5 speed and is geared for the highway. Driving on the open road the Silver Bullet will get up to 85 mph before you know it.
We were lucky to have bought it from the original owner. The Silver Bullet was their family van. One of our headrests has the bite mark from one of their sons to prove it. They took perfect care of it and babied it everyday. In the almost 3 years that we have owned it we have had only a few minor repairs.
What I love the most is when I am in a parking lot with the side door open and someone walks by and stops to awe at the room we have. Our van in a Carat so we have the bench with the two rear-facing removable jump seats and the pop-up table.
Kids and parents love it. We go camping, snowboarding and road tripping in it. 
When people ask us about it and if we like it, have any problems all we have to say is &quot;Hey, its got 253,000 miles and still runs great!&quot;
