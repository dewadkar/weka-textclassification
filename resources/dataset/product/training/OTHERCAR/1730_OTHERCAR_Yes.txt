            Volvo....the epitome of a safe car. The quest for one these fine autos began the summer before last. My mom got sick of driving a minivan, and since our family no longer necesatated such a car, she decided to treat herself to a nice car. Enter me. I'm the one in the family who likes cars, so she set me forth to pick a <b>safe<b> luxury car. After many hours online, I found a 97 Volvo 850 to be the best choice. So for about 4 months over that summer, I would come with her to the car lots to help her find what she wanted.<P>
After using one of those special car finder services, she comes home one day with a rather spiffy and classy white Volvo with gold pinstripes and woodgrain. This car has been completely wonderful, except for when it had some malfunctions but a sigh of relief...it was under warranty! This is a great car, and I highly recommend to anyone. From a sixteen year old's perspective, I <i>especially<i> like it! The tan leather seats are extremely comfortable and mold perfectly to your body. Mmmmm.....the sunroof adds a nice touch on warm days, and the AC in this baby is ice cold. I'm absolutely in love with the CD player.
The handling could be a little better, but I'd say those Swedes know how to make a great car. It's peppier than you might think... The safety is also a reassuring touch. If I'm in an accident, I will so be the one who survives =) Seeing as how I'm new driver and all.<P> Now, I would recommend that if you do buy a Volvo like my family did (used), make sure to get one that still is under its original factory warranty. The car developed some glitches about a year after we got it, and they would have been really expensive if it hadn't been covered.
