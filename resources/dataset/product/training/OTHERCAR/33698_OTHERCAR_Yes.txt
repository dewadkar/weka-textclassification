            This is my 3rd LS400, and will likely not be my last.

As far as engineering is concerned, these guys work overtime making sure that all facets are paid attention to.  The ergonomics of every dial, button, switch, and control are painstakingly researched to provide maximum ease of use and practicality.

The '97 version I leased was a Coach edition because the leather used was the same Coach leather used to make those fancy ladies pocketbooks.  The feel and smell are fabulous almost 3 years later.

My particular model has just about every bell and whistle Lexus offers (moon roof, Nakamichi stereo, ride height adjustment, heated seats, 6-disc changer, etc. etc.) and as such came out a bit pricey ($63K), but with sufficient negotiation, we managed to get the monthly lease down to a reasonable amount.

The one nit I have is that the back seat is not terribly roomy. This doesn't present a problem for me (I always drive), but it does for my kids.

If you're looking for a great long range vehicle, or a great commuting car (the mileage is quite good for a 290 hp luxury sedan with killer acceleration), this is the one for you.  You won't find a better combination of quality and customer focus in any competing vehicle.<br><br>
