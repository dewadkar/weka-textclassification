            The Kodak DC3200 is a great camera for a person looking for a relatively inexpensive and easy to use camera.  The camera is very easy to operate.  
You will most likely need to buy yourself some rechargeable batteries as this camera will eat them up when the LCD monitor is turned on.  The zoom is also quite limited in that you must be in a lower picture quality setting to utilize it, and then it is just a 2x digital zoom (clarity is lost as you zoom). Also, the DC3200 comes with just 2MB of internal memory.  You will need to get your hands on a flash memory card to up your storage capacity. (64 MB is about $30 now).  The software that is bundled with the camera is relatively limited as well.  I am under the impression that most people use another image editor program such as Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Illustrator to edit their pictures and depend upon the camera's software to simply get the pictures off of the camera and onto the computer.  The DC3200's software will do this well.
Aside from these few faults, the DC3200 is a great general purpose digital camera.  If you look around a bit, you can pick one up for under $100 as it is a older model with limited "extras" (no red-eye reduction, movies, optical zoom, etc.)  It would make a great second camera because you will not have to worry about bringing it to a place that it could potentially get damaged.  Most people that spend $400-$500 on their high-end cameras will find themselves handling them like newly born babies.  Not something you would want to have around your rowdy friends.  This camera is something you could trust with your children as well.  The user interface is easy enough for a child or a technology scared/challenged person and the size of the camera will allow a user to have a sturdy grip upon it.
