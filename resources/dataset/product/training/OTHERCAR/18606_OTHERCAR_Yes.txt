            My job requires a lot of travel for months at a time, and car rentals are something that I deal with quite frequently.  I've probably rented over a dozen cars from mid-size to full-size, and the Alero has to be the best one that I've rented.  I had the GLS model, so I am a little partial to the V6, but many of the people I work with have rented the base model, and every one of them has loved it. I try to rent a different type of car every time so that I can see what's out there when I'm ready to buy a new car, and I would still take the Alero over many full-sized cars such as the Chevy Impala, Buick Regal, and Oldsmobile Intrigue (although the Intrigue was the best full-sized).  The Alero handled great, had more than enough power, and I loved driving it.<br><br>
