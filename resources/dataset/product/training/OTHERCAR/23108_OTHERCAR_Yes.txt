            My husband bought me this camera for my birthday.  It was actually a substitution for a lower quality that was out of stock.  The pictures that I have taken with it are very nice, even at the lowest resolutions.  One of the things that I like best is the fact that you can preview and review as you are taking the pix.  The software that came with the camera is easy to use and it is completely compatible with our Adobe PhotoShop! Using PhotoShop is my preference because I have the opinion of where to save the pix and what to name them.  The package software names them by date and they can be difficult to find buried in programs/poloroid/album/so on and so on!  :)  My biggest complaint is that this baby eats batteries.  If you are willing to invest in rechargables, you can't beat the PDC640.<br><br>
