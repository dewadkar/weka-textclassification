            Volvo really is making a convertible. The $42,995 C70 is Volvo's first soft-top since like the 50's if i'm not mistaken in my research. This model so rare most auto buffs probably don't remember it. The new steel-body convertible is the soft-top version of the automaker's curvaceous C70 coupe. Being a Volvo... the convertible is safe and largely practical, with a large rear-seat area. However... the small, oddly shaped trunk is best suited to soft luggage. While a little bit on the pricy side... the C70 convertible is beautifully finished and well equipped. It's mainly for those who want top-down luxury motoring in a safe, stylish car with good rear seat space.
