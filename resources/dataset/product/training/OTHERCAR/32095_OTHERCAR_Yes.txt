            � So, imagine you're this Chrysler designer who has just finished penning the 1998 Concorde, arguably one of the most beauteous sedans since the Series III Jaguar XJ6.You're feeling pretty pleased with yourself . . . until your boss walks in and says: &quot;Oh by the way, we've decided to spin off a new LHS luxury sedan based on the Concorde architecture. Before you break for lunch, do you think you could draw us a new front end so the LHS will look different from Concorde?&quot;Then, just as he's on his way out the door again, the suit turns and adds: &quot;I almost forgot. We're also planning a sporty 300M model based on the same architecture. It'll need a new front end too.&quot;And one more thing,&quot; he tosses over his shoulder on his way to lunch: &quot;The 300M needs to be about 25 centimetres shorter than the LHS. See what you can do.&quot;You start by cancelling lunch.

OK, maybe it didn't happen quite like that. But you get the idea. It was one thing for Chrysler to make the new 1999 LHS and 300M look different from the Concorde; it was something else to make them look different and better. No surprises that it didn't happen � not to these eyes, anyway.

I'm not smitten with the faces of either of these new Chryslers, but at least the 300M has a nice rear end. The cut-off tail was needed to get body length down to the 5-metre mark which, in Europe, represents the threshold between grand and gross. Aesthetically, it lends the shape some muscular tension to suit the M's more athletic mandate.Designed with export in mind, the 300M is also the model most likely to find favour with World of Wheels readers and anybody else youthful enough to enjoy a car capable of decisive road moves. For those ld enough to remember, the 300M designation honours Chrysler's potent &quot;letter series&quot; cars of the Fifties and Sixties.

The LHS and 300M are built in Brampton, Ontario, in the plant and on the platform they share the 1998 Concorde and Intrepid. Their role is to polish the Chrysler brand image with two &quot;attitudinally different&quot; personalities � sophisticated, elegant and spacious LHS; sporty and aggressive 300M � that will cover the entry-luxury market more comprehensively than any one model.Cited rivals include Aurora, Continental and Park Avenue for the LHS, and A4, ES300, I30, Catera and Acura TL for the 300M.Styling apart, the key differentiator between Concorde and its new upscale siblings lies under the hood. Exclusive to LHS and 300M is the 3.5litre version of the corporation's new V6 (a 3.2-litre version is already available on Concorde and Intrepid). This technology-rich aluminum 24valver delivers 253 hp at 6,400 rpm, making it the most powerful naturally-aspirated V6 you can buy, according to Chrysler. Peak torque of 255 lb.ft is achieved at 3,950 rpm.Out on the road, the engine is world-class � wonderfully smooth, great sounding, and with a zest for revs that doesn't compromise low-end torque. Power reaches pavement through a 4-speed automatic transmission, with Chrysler's AutoStick manual-override control system standard on the 300M only. The transmission is so responsive in Drive that the AutoStick function is largely redundant.The LHS has its own chassis set-up, with dampers and bushings tuned for a quiet ride, and variable-assist power steering with &quot;touring&quot; response. Tires are aggressively-proportioned (but low 190 km/h speedrated) P225/55R17 Goodyear Eagle LSs.


 A brief sampling of the LHS on unfamiliar roads revealed a very civil ride, but handling responses a bit soft (and tires a tad squealy) for my tastes.The same tires are used on the base 300M, along with somewhat firmer suspension plus constant-effort steering that's firmer than LHS's below about 90 km/h and about the same above that speed.The one to have is the Handling Group chassis that is standard in Europe and optional in North America. This adds much meatier steering effort, plus firmer strut damping all around and taller jounce dampers at the rear. Interestingly the Handling Group's Michelin XGTV4 V-rated tires (which allow an unrestricted top speed approaching 240 km/h, says Chrysler) are smaller and taller (225/60R16) than those on the regular 300M.According to chassis guy Mike Raymond, lower-profile tires in combination with the stiffer suspension would have been too harsh.We think the smaller tires may create perception problems in selling the Handling Group, but the package as a whole certainly works. 

For all its meaty weighting the steering could still use more true road feel and sharper turn-in, but once it gets stuck into a turn the 300M is indecently athletic for a full-size American luxury car.The only way it could be significantly improved would be to make it rear-wheel drive (don't hold your breath.) It'll be interesting to see what the handling-obsessed European press think when they get hold of it.There is, however, one Achilles Heel in these cars. Just like the first base Intrepid last fall, the LHS and 300Ms I drove were prone to a rolling noise that sounds for all the world like slightly worn wheel bearings. Whatever the actual cause, it's a blemish that Chrysler needs to deal with.The 300M's different rear styling sacrifices some rear seat space compared with the LHS, but it's still an exceptionally roomy car. Overall interior ambience is tastefully elegant, though closer inspection reveals some cheap-looking mouldings, not least the chintzy &quot;wings&quot; moulded into the plastic surround of the clock in the LHS.Appointments on both are comprehensive if not quite at the level of &quot;if it ain't there, it ain't been invented yet.&quot; 
Standard fixtures include heatable driver and front passenger 6-way power seats with memory for the driver; automatic temperature control; heated outside mirrors; automatic day/night inside rearview mirror; traction control; trip computer; and AM/FM stereo/cassette/CD with nine speakers and 240watt amplifier.No side airbags, however, nor a 3-point belt for the rear centre seating position. The only options are a sunroof, chrome wheels and 320watt Infinity audio system.Both cars come to market keenly priced, at $38,900 for the 300M and $40,900 for LHS. If that doesn't give the opposition the willies, I don't know what will.<br><br>
