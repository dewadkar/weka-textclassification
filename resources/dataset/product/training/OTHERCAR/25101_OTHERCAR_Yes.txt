            The 1995 Dodge Ram 3500 with the 360 ci. gas motor is pretty rare when compared to the number of trucks produced with a Cummins Diesel.  The truck is built very well structurally and performance wise and stands up well to rough conditions.  The vehicle tested now has 110,000 miles and has been tested for the last 18,000 miles.  The only work performed on the vehicle has been regular oil changes and the front wheel bearings have been repacked.  Additionally, the front rotors had to be turned.  At about 100,000 miles the rotors had become warped very badly which caused severe shaking in the front end when brakes are applied.  Other than that, the truck runs very well.  It shows nice acceleration for a one-ton rated truck and pulls very well.  The automatic transmission has shown no problems and has had to pull a load every once in a while.  With a heavy load, the truck will easily pull in third gear at 70 or higher speeds without running up the engine RPM up too high.  It pulls 70 at 2900 RPM which will provide excellent longevity for the motor and transmission.  The only problems with the truck has been a vacuum leak which causes the vent air to blow through the defroster when the truck is exposed to an extra load, such as a hill.  Additionally, the transmission has to downshift too often out of overdrive when going up a hill.  This problem was corrected, however, with a better air-flow K&amp;N Filtercharger instead of a stock air filter.  The ride comfort is exceptional for a one ton, and the ergonomics of the interior is top-of-the-line.  However, the truck only gets about 14 mpg empty and about 11 towing.  For a few extra dollars invested in a Cummins Diesel, the diesel is without a doubt the best motor for frequent towing.<br><br>
