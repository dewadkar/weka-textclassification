            The HP 315 is the second digital camera I have owned. My first was  Polaroid that was replaced 3 times under warranty. I saw where that road was leading, so I decided to start out with a new camera.

My uses for this camera are fairly straight forward- listing on Ebay and taking pictures for my websites. I still own a 35mm for important family pictures. 

This time around, I was looking for a camera with a USB connection and a decent LCD screen. I'm not overly impressed with the LCD screen. It is sometimes very difficult to view, especially in a bright area. 

The 2.5x zoom capability is useful, but takes some getting used to. The round "rocker" button on the back of the camera controls the zoom, going from 1.5 to 2.5. This button also controls erasure of pictures, review of shots, and general manipulation of the user menu. 

The nice features on this camera are the auto focus and exposure, the integrated flash with red-eye reduction, and the self timer, which I have used on a few occasions. There are three photo quality settings- basic (640x480 resolution), fine (1200x1600 resolution) and super-fine, which also has the same resolution as the "fine" setting, but is recommended for taking pictures that you plan to crop and enlarge or print larger than an 8"x10" print. 

I was disappointed that this camera outfit did not come with an A/C adapter. HP recommends that you purchase their adapter for $49.95. My previous digital camera outfits came with the A/C adapter, which is nice- it does save on batteries when you are uploading your pictures to your PC or when you are reviewing your pictures on the LCD screen. 

The software included in the purchase of the HP 315 is Adobe's PhotoDeluxe, ArcSoft PhotoImpression, ArcSoft PhotoMontage. I have honestly not given enough time to using the software to give an accurate review of it. 

All in all, I am much happier with this camera, than I was with my previous one. The pictures are of better quality and the connection to my PC is much better with the USB.
