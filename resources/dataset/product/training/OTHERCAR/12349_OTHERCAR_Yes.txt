            Exterior: Small and compact with 3 simple buttons and a small LCD info display at the top. The camera casing seems well put together and is quite pocket sized with an automatic built- in flash that is really bright.

Features: has several features and the ability to store up to 70 VGA pictures. There is a slider switch on the side that lets you alternate between Macro and Regular mode. It has auto- shut off and several shooting options to choose from. It only runs on 2 AA batteries and it connects really easily to a computer with a USB port only. The camera comes with installation software and a photo editing program called Arc PhotoImpression, which is cool and easy to use. Also you can use the videocam mode to shoot live action video on your PC and make a movie with the AVI moviemaker that comes with the cameras software bundle. But be cautious, only a fast processor and good memory and a good video card should attempt this.

Connectivity: only with a USB port!
