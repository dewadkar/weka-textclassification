             In 1996 my husband and I were in need of a newer vehicle. So when a nice looking 4dr Grand Am GT with 22,000 miles was for sale with a tempting price, we decided to buy it.   
All was well for the first few months and then the problems started. First our thermostat went, followed by a radiator hose. All is fine, we can live with a few replacement parts these things wear out. After about a year the car decided it liked to stop running and would frequently stall for no reason. We even had it towed to our dealership(because it wouldn't start) to have them repair it. Well nothing wrong could be found and it still remains a mystery to all. 
The final headache came when we lost the transmission at 42,0000 miles, and it was an automatic. The car also held water somewhere behind the glovebox, and after it rained you'd have a nice ocean lapping the shore sound to soothe you whenever you accelerated. 
I absolutely hated this car, and I don't think I'll ever by another GM product. <br><br>
