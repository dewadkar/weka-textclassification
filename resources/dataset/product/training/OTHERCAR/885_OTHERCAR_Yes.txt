            I wasn't even in the market for a digital camera when I acquired the Olympus Camedia C-3000 Zoom.  My husband already had a Sony Mavica and that was enough.  Then one day I logged onto a sweepstakes website I had joined, and low and behold I had won the Camedia C-3000!  I was shocked, but excited.  I needed a new camera, and this one was free.

The camera arrived in about a week and I opened it with gusto.  I'd read a lot about the camera since I learned I had won.  So I sort of new what to expect.  I was still surprised though, it came with a remote control (that I have yet to use), a SmartMedia 8mb card, a good, strong neckstrap, and all the other goodies.  It even came with batteries!  That's hard to comeby anymore.

I put the batteries in, figured out how to turn it on and started snapping pictures.  When the card got full after 5 pictures I started getting mad, then I realized it was set on a high resolution.  The camera comes preset on 2054x1024, so if you want more pictures on the card, you have to change the presets, be sure to read the manuel before hand.  I didn't and I couldn't get it to stay on the new preset.

This camera takes great pictures, as long as the lighting is right.  I'm not to happy with the flash.  The flash only works to about 30 feet.  Anything past that and you will get grainy pictures, unless you have good additional lighting.  There is an option for an external flash, but you have to fork out the money for it, and I understand that they are not that cheap.

Also, if you are looking for a camera with interchangable lenses, this is not the camera for you.  The lens that is on it is the lens you get.  That's it, no way to change it.  And be sure to keep track of that lens cap!  They don't include any way to attach it to the strap, so it is easily lost.  I've misplaced mine a couple of times, but luckily I keep finding it.

Battery life in this camera is horrible.  If you've seen the commercial where the electronic gadgets eat the batteries, this camera needs to be in it.  The batteries that came with it lasted about a month, and subsequential batteries lasted as short as four days.  We finally invested in rechargables, and that has saved us a lot of money!  I'd recommend you do that as well.
