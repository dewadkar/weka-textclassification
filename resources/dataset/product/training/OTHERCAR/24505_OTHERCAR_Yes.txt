            I was envious of a friend's canon G2, but for typical use this will do as well for 1/4 the price.

This is my second digital camera.  A year and a half ago I bought a Kodak DC3200.  That camera has proven to be very a very solid, basic digital, but missing some features I did not want to do without.  Tripod mount, selftimer, optical zoom/ exposure control were not avail in a digital camera that was affordable for me at that time.

One year later this Vivitar was featured at Staples for $229 with a $50 rebate.  I knew I wanted to double my pixels, add the tripod mount, self timer, optical zoom, and exposure control and this camera did all that for $179 net.
It also takes basic avi format movies which was a nice suprise bonus.
3x optical zoom is all I need in all cases encountered so far.  2x digital zoom is there for the rare occasions I may need it (haven't yet).
Typical of digital cameras powerup is slooow.  It seems to take forever, which is the watched pot syndrome.  It is less than 3 seconds, but by the time that is done and you focus in and zoom where you want, you have missed many photo ops.  This is true of all digital cameras I have encountered.
The on/off switch is the only real complaint I have.  It is a self retracting slide, which does not offer any "feedback" whether you actually got it switched on or not.  I wind up having it not powerup much more often than I would like.  If the switch slides back too soon, you wait a second for the delayed powerup mentioned above and try again if it doesn't turn on.  If you presume it is not powering up and try again, you shut it off if it was just the standard powerup delay!
8 megs of included internal memory will take care of most photo occasions (20 1600x1200 with medium compression), even a few seconds of movies.  Being digital, you can quickly review photos on the tiny screen and delete any that obviously did not work out.  With a 128meg compact flash card I never came close to running out of room on a 3 week  trip cross country with 10 days of backpacking.  Over 300 pics! And a few minutes of movies! If I had run out of room, I could have removed the compact flash card and used the internal memory for 8megs.
Speaking of backpacking, using a light camera case with hardly any padding this camera survived without a scratch.  I have dropped it a few times and no ill effects yet.  
Flash covers four different formats (off, on, auto, red eye).
This system even includes a connection to AV inputs so you can view a slide show of your photos on a TV!
LCD display on top for battery status, compression settings and number of remaining photos is too small to be used easily, selection buttons for format and flash settings are also too small and impossible to use in low light situations.  The camera performs great in low light, but you can't tell what changes you are making to settings.  Fortunately auto is fine to leave it on at almost all times.  About half of the pics I took in Carlsbad caverns came out the way I wanted without enhancement by the photo processing software included.  Much better than I would have expected.
LCD display on back does not do well in bright sunlight, but I doubt any camera for less than $400 does.  Other than bright sun, true colors come through and you can even zoom in on parts of the photo you are reviewing.
Include software does the basics but is not user friendly.  
I haven't used the download USB connection as I use a Lexar jumpstart to download directly off the compact flash card.

Two sets of Nickel Metal hydride batteries and a charger will take care of battery needs.  Ritz camera has a fast charger that will charge them almost as fast as I could discharge them with constant use.
My only disappointment is the lack of a multipix mode. Some cameras will take several photos with almost no delay between photos which covers the actions shots you may want.  The avi movie option does make up for that when lighting is good.
There is also the option of using it as a web cam if you have a microphone.
My one pet peeve is when you power up to review photos the lens extends, which I am sure is a power drain and wear on the lens motor etc, which is not necessary.
