            I have owned my 2002 Acura TL-S since last August.  Prior to this car, I have owned a 91 Acura Legend, 93 Honda Civic, 96 Infiniti I30.  So that is what I can compare.  I have also driven my father's Acura RL 3.5 enough to compare.  So based on that, the first thing I noticed is Power.  Literally, every time I need an extra bit of power to pass someone, make a light, etc., it is always there.  You can accelerate on the highway and look down in shock as you merge in and you have already hit 80+ mph.  If you get the hand of the sport-shift, then you can even improve your acceleration more (In second gear you can hit 60 as fast as a Camaro, I kind of raced one once when I first got the car, believe me, its fast).  It is a lot faster than the 3.5 RL.

The handling is very nice.  It can hold turns pretty tight and whenever I have even started to slip in bad weather, the anti-skid picks it up and really works.

The car is smooth on the highway but will get a little bumpy on poor roads.  You don't feel the difference at higher speeds, at least not compared to my other cars.

The interior is great looking in the S-type.  I love the white panel displays and the seats are great.  They really hold you in tight.  You kind of feel like you are in a sport car.

The exterior, you should decide for yourself, but I think the car is great looking.  However, I have developed a few somewhat noticable scratches after a year of probably getting banged a little in parking lots etc.  

I recommend the TL-S highly.  I have had no problems and it is a true joy to drive and keep.  by the way, my mileage for a recent trip was over 400 miles/full tank of all highway driving.  Better than any of the other cars I had except the Civic.
