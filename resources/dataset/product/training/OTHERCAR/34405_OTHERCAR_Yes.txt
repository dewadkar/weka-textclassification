            Straight out of University and 2 months into my first job, I decided I needed a new car.  Stupid me, I bought the first car I looked at... a Chevy TRACKER!  I thought it was &quot;cute&quot;... I'm such a girl!

K, don't let that discourage you from reading the rest of my review though...the good news is after about 5 months, I knew it had to go! I hated it.  

Anyway..I was out driving one day and saw a Tiburon...My first thought honestly was that it must be a really expensive car.  However, I decided to check out some prices anyway.  I was shocked and surprised how amazingly reasonable these cars are!  So I started the whole process happening, I dealt with a local dealer who was great and even gave me a good price for my Tracker.  

December 24th 1998 I picked up my 1998 Hyundai Tiburon, black with the smaller spoiler on the back. I loved it immediately! Now, the reason I called my review &quot;A woman's point of view&quot; is because other than make and model, I don't really know about cars. This is NOT a technical review dealing with engine size and that kinda stuff.

Anyway, two months ago, I got in an accident with it, and totaled the front end (I hit a Mercedes...if you're going to do something, you might as well do it all the way right?) 

There was so much damage that the engine had been crushed, it actually stopped running on impact, the gear shift was stuck in drive, the key was stuck in the ignition etc etc etc...the tow truck driver laughed at me when I asked if they were going to take it to the dealership. As it turns out I had done 10,000$ damage to the body alone, plus I had crushed the engine. The incredible news is that I didn't even have a bump or bruise.  People had been walking by the accident site sure that someone was badly hurt, and honestly, I felt almost no impact at all. This is a really safe car.

So my insurance company wrote it off and again I was car shopping. Well, loving my '98 the way I did, then seeing how it held up in a pretty bad accident, I went to Hyundai and drove a new 2000.  I ordered one in Cobalt Blue, the Sports Edition, which came with everything - air conditioning, power everything, CD player (Clarion) and a sunroof!
After driving it for two months I still love it.

Overall? a woman's point of view? It's a hot car that gets me TONS of second glances. I love it when people say &quot;wow&quot; about my car! It drives fast, handles great, it's so comfortable and the stereo rocks!
