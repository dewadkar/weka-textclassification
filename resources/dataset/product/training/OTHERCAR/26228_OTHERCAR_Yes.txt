             This SUV is an outstanding one for several reasons:

1.) The reliability after 20,000 miles has been nothing short of flawless. (No unnecessary visits to the shop.)

2.)The ride makes you feel as if you are floating in air. When you go off road, the ride gets a little choppy, but much better than most utes.

3.) The handling has a center feel to it, I have test driven the Lexus RX300, Acura MDX, and the Mercedes ML, the Mercedes had the best handling though.

4.) The build quality in this vehicle is the best you'll find out there. Need I say more?

5.) The leather seats are buttery soft and very supportive, unlike the very hard Mercedes SUV seats.

This SUV executes style, performance, Luxury and quality. BMW has comes a long was from the early 1980's with its product. 
The Sport package is expensive at about $2,500..The wheels and suspension are upgraded, but the ride leaves the passengers and driver getting tossed around on regular roads. Thats my only complaint. The other upgrade is better leather and burl walnut.

The seats in the rear are adjustable if you order that opinion package, but there is not much room to adjust them. 

All of the controls are very easy to read, I really like the easy to read and use A/C and navagation and radio buttons. I particular like the read out gauges in the dash speedometer, tachometer, oil, battery, and gas readouts, most cars don't have those gauges very helpful.

The cargo is very small, but I have been able to manage just fine. I don't carry anything except two labs back there so no worries for me..But I know the M-class Mercedes, has a lot of cargo room.

The quality of this vehicle is impressive. Not one detail is overlooked in this SUV everything is built tightly. Mercedes had some quality issues with there 1998-1999 models, from what I've seen it's a lot better. But still not up to Mercedes standards. So BMW defiantly wins this catagory.
