            This small SUV is a joy to drive.  The vehicle is on the tall side and getting in and out is great - no bumping your head or knocking your knees. I feel safe driving this SUV due to all the metal surrounding me and its height.  
While cornering I do tend to slow down a bit as I feel the vehicle is more grounded, less likely to tip (my own insecurity I think but then I'm not in a race).  
I like to camp so I bought this Rav4 L series - this summer will tell when I pack the cargo section/racks on top.  I have a tall son (6'3&quot;) and he feels fine sitting in the front seat (no bumping his head).  I feel I have the best of both worlds, a bigger 'car' but not a monstrous SUV - and it parks well.  Its 'fanny' doesn't stick out.  
Gas being expensive doesn't bother me too much - this baby doesn't take much to get around for its size.  I took it from SF to LA and ENJOYED the ride even though I was alone.  The factory CD player is excellent - one CD at a time so I don't have to stop and 'reload' several CD's.  Passing Harris' smelly beef ranch all I had to do was switch the air to internal only.  Worked well - didn't smell a thing!  I do worry about the spare tire on the back - it is not locked down and could be stolen (I asked the Parts Dept. at Toyota).  Have had a hard time finding all weather floormats. It is a popular size and several places were out of stock. Wanted a BugShield, but Toyota doesn't make them for the Rav4, just the 4Runner (??) Lund makes them but they use double-stick tape on your hood (along with nuts/bolts at each side)- not crazy about this idea.
