            I bought my Trooper back in '96.  The dealer (very helpful) was in Virginia and I was moving to Denver.  Obviously out of the box the Trooper got a good highway workout.  About 18 mpg fully loaded with possessions.  I have had zero problems with this SUV since purchase.  I regularly changed the oil and such but that is it.  Since I live in Colorado, I have beaten the heck out my Trooper.  It spends about 20% of its life in 4wd.  It is a very agile and trustworthy 4wheeler.  My friends can't getover the roominess inside.  The only thing I would want is a bigger engine, and I know recent models have had that.  I'll be buying another Trooper in a few years!<br><br>
