            We have owned Mercedes since 1970, including ones we kept for 10 years, one for 17 years and one for 30 years.  We took delivery of one of the first ML320s on faith that this vehicle would continue in the proud line of Mercedes-Benz.

After 2 fuel pump failures that required tows of 200 miles and one of only 2 miles, we told the dealer we wanted a new vehicle.  In February of 2000, our 1998 model was replaced after we agreed to pay a modest amount for the 24 months we had the first one.

Everything was fine with the new vehicle, although we got tired of the truck suspension that makes most routine city driving less than comfortable.  In July of 2001, we were driving from Colorado to Los Angeles at the end of a vacation.  We stopped in Salina, Utah for gas, turned the ignition and heard the engine fail to start.  My wife and I looked at each other in total disbelief, knowing from experience that the fuel pump had failed on this replacement vehicle.

A call to Roadside Assistance made the matter worse, because they would only give me a free tow to Salt Lake City, 200 miles out of our way to L.A.  After pleading with a supervisor, he authorized a tow to Las Vegas.

When we returned to L.A., I sent a letter to the President of MB North America.  We have never had a response from his office.

My advice is not to buy an ML under any circumstances.  It has sullied the Mercedes emblem, has a lot of cheap plastic parts and will not hold its value after others discover that "Made in the USA" and the Mercedes Benz star are not compatible.
