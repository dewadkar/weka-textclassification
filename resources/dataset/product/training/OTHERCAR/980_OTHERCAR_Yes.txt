            <b>Toddler Friendly Features</b>

While aimed at the youth market, this vehicle is great for carting around my toddler son.  My wife says lifting him to and from the childseat is much easier on her back with this vehicle than with our more traditional sedan.  The fabric is easy to clean.  Also, there is plenty of room in the cargo area for all of that toddler stuff.  The nets really help organizing it all.

Long trips are easier too.  One parent can sit in the back seat to service our son and still feel like they are with the driver by folding down the front passenger seat.  This also gives the back seat parent access to the cargo area for all of those munchies.

Our Matrix also has the 6-CD in dash changer.  This lets us load up both "grown up" and toddler CDs.  When he drops off to sleep, we can turn off "Itsy Bitsy Spider" and turn on the Dave Matthews Band with the push of a button instead of all of the regular hassle.

<b>Commuter Friendly Features</b>

With the 5-speed manual transmission on the XR trim, the EPA estimated mileage is 29/36 mpg.  That doesn't compare with the mileage of the new hybrids, but I'll take it!

When its your turn to drive the office gang to lunch, the tall folks actually fit in the back seat.  I'm 6'1" and have head room to spare in the back seat.

<b>Dad Friendly Features</b>

This is fun to drive!  

In addition to driving, it also makes a suitable travel office.  I often find that I need to review technical papers over lunch.  I simply drive to a nearby park, fold the passenger seat down flat and use it as a small desk as I sit in the back seat.  I fold down the driver side back seat to use as table to hold my lunch.  If I had a notebook computer, the 115v AC power outlet in the dashboard would be useful also.

When we adopted our son, I decided that I wanted to replace my pickup with a vehicle that could hold our entire family.  I don't really have a professional need for a pickup and can rent one for the one or two times a year I really need one.  The Matrix has plenty of cargo space for the things I really haul more often but don't fit in a sedan.

Also, being a bit of a tree hugger, I appreciate the relatively high mileage and the ULEV engines of the base and XR models.

<b>Un-Friendly Features</b>

If you want a quiet luxery sedan, an SUV, or a roaring sports car, get one.  Don't waste your time on this vehicle.  The Matrix is only for folks who want a small, practical, fun and affordable vehicle.
