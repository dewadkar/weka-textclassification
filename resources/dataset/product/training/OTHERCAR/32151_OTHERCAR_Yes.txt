            Since no one else had ventured an opinion on the Daewoo Lanos I thought I would relate my experience renting one in San Francisco.  I picked up a green 1999 Lanos at the SF Airport,  I was expecting to rent a Dodge Neon and was a little disappointed to get the more compact Daewoo.  The car had a few hundred miles on it and was tight and rattle-free,  It had air conditioning and an automatic transmission so it could not be considered a fast accelerator, especially with three people onboard.  During the course of 4 days I spent quite a bit of time in the Lanos and was generally pleased with the quality of the vehicle.  It was definitely great in the city...enough acceleration (with the A/C off) and easy to park in the challenging San Francisco urban landscape.  On the highway it was a small car feeling typically like others of its ilk.  Nothing horrible, just what you would expect for such a tiny machine.  <br><br>
