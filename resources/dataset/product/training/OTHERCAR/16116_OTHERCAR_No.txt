            We purchased our 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo in October 1999. It has been in the shop for the following: brake rotors (3 times), faulty electrical system.

We first noticed the brakes stuttering at about 5,000 miles. The first diagnosis was, "You're too hard on your brakes." We're not. For all of the vehicles we've owned, prematurely worn brakes have never been an issue. They replaced the brake pads. Less than 2,000 miles later, the brakes started to stutter again. This diagnosis, the rotors are warped. Replace under warranty. At about 23K, the stuttering recurs. Rotors again replaced under warranty.

Around 30K the lights and horn spontaneously engage, either together or separately. Always while the truck is parked without the key in the ignition. First diagnosis, "It's your imagination...we couldn't find anything." A month later, after several more incidents, they find a faulty relay/switch in the electrical system. Replaced under warranty. This problem has not recurred since.

Around 40K the brake stuttering returns. The rotors again. This time the warranty's expired, and we pay through the nose. At about 55K, the stuttering has returned. This time we're going for aftermarket cast iron rotors. The material Chrysler/Jeep uses is simply too flimsy and prone to warping. According to a former Chrysler engineer, rotors should last 80K or more.

Gas mileage is so-so. Comfort and conveniences are superior. We bought the F package with leather seats, CD player, moon roof--the works. Nice ride, handles well, excellent acceleration. Too many times in the shop for the same problem--unnecessary, inconvenient, and annoying.

About a year ago, I had a choice between buying a new PT Cruiser and a Toyota RAV4, and chose the RAV4. Didn't feel confident in Daimler-Chrysler's quality control based on our experiences with the Laredo.
