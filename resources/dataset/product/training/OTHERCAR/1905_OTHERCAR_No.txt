            Have you bought one single item that almost drove you to insanity ???... Well... In case you have'nt but are itching for the experience... Buy a AFGA CL 18 Digital Cam.
Yes... i know, the Ads, articles and even a good mail refund, seemed to make this cam the most desirable item of my tiny Santa's wish-list...
But this camera can only make &quot;The GRINCH&quot; awfully happy when you try to summon all your patience not to dance a Flamenco Dance on top of it !!! 
The user's Guide is a NO GOOD !!!...Lacks information, Troubleshooting hints besides &quot; check the batteries &quot; is 
NON-EXISTENT... Customer Support ???... NAHHHH !!!...
Windows 98 compatability ???... Only in your dreams... Or Nightmares for that matter !!!
Dont get me wrong... Maybe the fault is not the camera itself... BUT the WORST driver and utilities CD i have &quot;Honest to god&quot; seen !!!
The price of this little webcam might look as a bargain... But do not be tempted...
I have spent almost 7 straight hours ( its almost 4am )and it just wont work !!!... The only way i can see the photos is connecting the cam to the TV set... BUT there is no way to save them without computer support.
Please...Just ... make it easy on yourself and AVOID this little cam of horrors

Happy Holidays !!!<br><br>
