            I got a 1996 Jeep Chereokee. Its got leather seats and a C.D. Player. One of the only things I don't like about it is that it only has 2 Wheel Drive
and it is front wheel drive. It gets pretty bad gas mileage too, but it is not that bad, I can drive around town all day for about two days,(I mean all day).  
It handles well though, and I have not ever come close to flipping it.  Also, it has very good pick-up.  I can burn just about anyone in a race, at first, but then they burn my ass.  
Overall, I'd say this Jeep is a good Automobile.<br><br>
