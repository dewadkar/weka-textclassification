            <b>What I bought</b>

I just purchased a Corolla Type S at a local dealer for around 15K.  The sticker price was 16K, which included automatic everything, A/C, stereo am/fm cassette, and and alarm.  I bargained the price down to 15k out the door at a Southern California dealer (the nation's biggest).  When I got into the car, I immediately noticed the stylish black sporty interior with the black/red gauges, digital clock, sporty cloth seats, and beautiful leather-clad sport steering wheel.  

<b>The Ride</b>

I took the car off the lot for a quick test drive and decided to push it and see how well a "family" car can perform.  I was amazed that the throttle response was quick, but definitely lacking that sudden "ummpph" from a sports car like a RX-7 or my 240sx.  However, for a 4-door, it does have good power going to the wheels from a great Vtti Toyota 24-valve engine.  I had no trouble picking up speed and the handling was excellent.  Road noise is not silent like you find in the Lexus, but it is quite low and having your stereo up, you probably won't even notice anything outside (which might not be a good thing).  

<b>The Exterior</b>

The Corolla 2002 S has the same styling as the 2001 model, however the S type is the best of the Corollas because it includes side fenders that create a more sporty look plus it has 2 nice foglights on the front bumper.  I purchased a black model which I think looks really gorgeous paired with all the red gauges inside.  Add a few enchancements like a sports exhaust and an air intake and the Corolla will be suitable for everyday driving plus be able to handle any event which might require you to pick up the speed and make some sharp turns.  

<b>Conclusion</b>

I think the 2002 Toyota Corolla is an awesome car, it has a nice engine, a great price tag, and is an all around great performer.  If you're looking for a family car but don't have the money to get a Camry or Accord, I think the Corolla is a better choice than the Civic.  Both are very fuel efficient, my Corolla comes in at 39MPG on Highway, but the Corolla will come in at least a thousand dollars less.  I'm waiting to put some nice wheels and tires on it and add a nice stereo system.  Other than that, the Corolla is great for your commute and for those long drives down the beautiful California Coast.
