            Ok, if you are like me, you do not like new car shopping.  After having my 1996 neon(a car I did not especially care for as it was my mom's old car) totaled in an accident I decided that I would go out and purchase a new car as I was making plenty of money to cover monthly payments.

As as cars in my price range i pretty much had little choice as far as different makes and models.  There was about one car for each major auto maker that would fit into my price range. (i.e. Honda Civic, Mazda Protege, Dodge Neon)  So this greatly narrowed down my choices.

I ended up torn between the 2000 Neon and the 2000 Civic.  My experience with the 1996 Neon was a very favorable one except for the look of it which I did not really care for.  However, pretty much everyone is in agreement that Honda's are some of the most reliable cars on the market today.  So the advantage went to the Civic.

As far as the outside look and design of the cars I had to give a distinct advantage to the Neon.  While the Civic had a nice look, it looked exactly the same as Civics two and three years ago.  However, the Neon got a complete makeover in my eyes.  The trademark headlights are still there but there is something about the new Neons that just shows a lot more class about them than appeared in the years before.  

With my specific price range on the Civics I was limited to a choice of 3 colors, Hunter Green, Silver, and a rather ugly in my opinion shade of Blue.  However I could pick pretty much any color Neon I wanted.  I ended up going with a very nice Patriot Blue color.

I was also able to pick up quite a few extra options on the Neon that I would have been forced to leave out had I gone with a Civic.  Such options include a 4-disc cd changer with radio and tape deck, 16' aluminum wheels, power windows(only on the front windows however) power locks, cruise control, etc.  

However, even with the loss of options I was still going to give the Civic a chance and would compare which car I like driving the best and that would be the final determinant of my search.  I drove both cars and was quite impressed with the Neon's quick acceleration and smooth handling.  

I now have around 8000 miles on my 2000 Neon ES model and have been extremely pleased with my decision.  The value I found with the Neon was simply untouchable.  Although it is still a little premature to say the performance has been flawless.  

While, I do not expect anyone to just go jump out and buy a Neon as a result of this I hope that this will shed some light on those who may be afraid of the Neon's performance and that you will go out and test drive one.  Thank you for your time.
