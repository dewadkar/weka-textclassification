            I ended up buying this car after first looking into its bigger sibling, the Intrepid.  I was looking for a family car that offered, most importantly, more room and cargo space.  After deciding that the Intrepid was a little too much car for my needs, I took a look at the Stratus.  I was pleasantly surprised by the interior space and generous trunk, and two test drives confirmed that it was a comfortable ride that handled reasonably well.

After two years of ownership, I can say that I don't have any major regrets.  The car has proven to be as comfortable as it first appeared, and reliable as well (the only malfunction I can report is some strange behavior in the fuel gauge/low fuel light.)  After a fair amount of highway driving, though, I would probably recommend the upgrade to the more powerful V6.  For a car of this size and weight, the 2.0L V4 really has to struggle to get up to speed on an incline.  Braking distance is also a little underwhelming, but that too has not been a significant concern.

Other minor issues include cabin noise, which has been improved in later models, and engine noise in particular.  While the road handling and suspension are good, the car has a large turning radius which can make maneuvering in tight areas a little awkward.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the Stratus--it's a remarkable value for a roomy family vehicle.<br>
