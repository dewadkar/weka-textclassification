            This is the best 2MP point and shoot digital camera now in my opinion. 

My first digicam is an Olympus 2020Z. Its picture quality is great. But
in a few weeks, the protruding lens stopped working. So I returned it.
But my digital photography experience was so good that I have to buy
another digital camera. This time, afraid of fragile lens problems, I
bought a zoom-less Epson photoPC 800. Its picture color was so bad that
I do not even want this camera for a tenth of its price.  So I returned
it also. Now what should I do? I still want a digital camera. I looked
Nikon models (800 &amp; 950). Nikon's zooming lens is covered, so it will be
robust. But based on the sample pictures on the web and messages in the
news group, I noticed Nikon also has some color problem. In-door
pictures tend to be cold and white. People also talk about purple cast,
and red eye problems. So I did not go ahead with Nikon. Then one day I
went to a local shop, I saw Olympus D-490Z. It is like a compact and
less manual version of 2020Z. I knew its picture quality must be
comparable to 2020Z. Its lens is less fragile, since the moving parts
are hidden in a barrel, although the barrel is moving. So I believe
D-490Z should give me the good picture quality of 2020Z without 2020Z's
fragile lens. I bought D-490Z. It is just as I expected. I got great
pictures in all situation in full auto mode -- in door or out door,
cloudy or shining, with or without flash. It has some White Balance
settings for different in door light conditions and out door weather
conditions. But I never used them. The auto mode is just good enough. I
also noticed this camera performs extremely well in low light without
flash -- the pictures are just like what you see in the real scene.<br><br>
