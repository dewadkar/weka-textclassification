            I know that everyone's been dying to find out with what kind of car I replaced my beloved BMW 325e.  A month and a half later, I am the proud owner of a thoroughly researched '99 Mazda Protege. I'm quite happy with the interior, which is just as comfortable and the BMW, and happy enough with the engine, which certainly isn't as powerful, but still could get me some speeding tickets. 

The ride is quiet and smooth, the gas mileage is terrific, and although I don't have stats yet on the maintenance, I expect it to be very reliable.  I have all the records for the past year, and the only things it's needed are brakes pads.  I bought it from Hertz, which I would highly recommend.  They have a no-haggle policy, but their prices are very fair, and since this one was on sale, I got it for $500 less then Edmunds.com said I should pay.  I went in with a not-so-great deal on a car loan, and they found me a deal with a credit union where the interest rate was HALF of what I'd been offered.  

But this is a review of the Mazda Protege - so back to that.  It had 25,800 miles on it, and was kept very clean and smoke-free.  
The only arguments I have with the console are that I sometimes accidentally turn the wipers on when I'm reaching for the CD player, and the odometer is electronic, so you can't read it if the engine's off.  There is a trip odometer, but you have to push a button to view it.  I'm happy about finally having a cup holder and air conditioning that works.  The standard CD player is fine for my listening sensibilities.

It's not quite the ultimate driving machine, but for this commuter, it's a very comfortable (and more affordable) alternative. <br><br>
