            When Kia finally made it to the east coast of the USA there advertising stated everybody
deserves an inexpensive well made car - anything could be further from the truth.
In March 1998 my wife and I were looking
for a car for her since her 1989 Pontiac was on its last legs. Kia was offering a large rebate on leftover 1997 Sephias. This should
have been my first warning sign. As soon as we brought the car home a pretty bad rotten egg smell was comming from underneath the car,
the catalytic converter was bad. It rained that night and when I can outside the left front headlamp was filled with water. We 
brought the car back and naturally it was fixed under warranty. About 1000 miles later
the brakes were acting funny we took the car 
back to the dealer and the brake rotors were warping, it was the dealer's impression that
"inferior" rotors were put on at the factory. The first warm day we had I put the a/c on
and guess what(?) it was blowing warm air, another trip back to the dealer to have the compressor changed. I'm known to take very good care of my cars, as I was waxing the
Sephia I noticed a white peel in the paint
the dealer had no explanation for this.
At about 3500 miles a serious problem developed, as I was at a intersection getting
ready to make a left turn the car died on me.
How I wasn't hit to this day remains a mystery. I managed to get it started and
soon after it stalled out. Another trip back to the dealer. The car was laid up at the 
dealer for 10 days. The Kia dealership had to call

back to Kia in Korea and the engineers there
couldn't figure out the problem. Ultimately
the whole starting system had to be replaced.
At 5000 miles rotors warped again. At this point I was getting fed up after numerous complaints to the dealer and Kia of America
I decided to unload this car. I paid over $12000 for it and 13 months later I sold
it for $5500!!!!!! I showed the car to one person he took it out on the highway and as he try to slow down - you guessed it the
rotors had begun to go bad. Pretty 
embarrassing. Anyway I traded this car in for a Saturn. No complaints here. The Kia dealer I bought my car from has since changed ownership 3 times. When I tried to sell it back they wanted no part of it. I didn't find
this unusual since he had no used Kias on his lot. Now Kia is offering long warranties don't be fooled by this gimmick. You'll be
sorry since your car will spend more time 
at the dealership than on the road. It
is my opinion that the Koreans still have long way to go before they know how to build
a reliable automobile.
