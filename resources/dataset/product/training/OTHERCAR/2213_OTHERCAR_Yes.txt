            I owned a 1998 Prelude and I will always look back on the car with fond memories.  How can people possibly buy an eclipse or a celica when you can get a prelude for similar money.  Not only will the Prelude trash any Celica in performance, it doesn't beep like a truck when you put it in reverse.  And unlike the eclipse you won't be in the repair shop all the time.  Not only is the 200 horsepower 4 cylinder engine a blast to rev to the red line, its also the most reliable Honda over even the civic or the Accord.  If that doesn't say a lot then I don't know what does.  I know the headlights are ugly but they grow on you and work rather well too.  This car corners better than anything costing thousands more.  My one big complaint was the back seat is useless and might as well not be in the car.  I also would like to see honda put out a prelude that has standard factory leather.  The stereo is fantastic, it has acoustic feedback which means it has microphones that listen to the sound and isolate out distortion.  Honda has been making very few Preludes for 2001 and some are speculating it might be the last year for the car, so get one while you can.
