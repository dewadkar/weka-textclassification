            The Chevy Cavalier is a nice reliable car as most Chevy's are.  However, such a boring, awful car.  If you simply want cheap dependability, go for it.  As a driving enthusiast, I demand more from a car.

The Cavalier is slow, poor ride and handling car, making it a chore to drive. I constantly found myself with my foot to the floor to keep up with normal traffic, as the engine is not responsive or powerful.  The car has vast understeer and takes too much effort to maneuver.

The whole car interior feels cheap.  The Cavalier I drove was a rental car, so maybe they can be a little nicer.

Other cars to consider around the $20k mark:

Honda Prelude
Toyota Celica GT-S
Volkswagen GTI or Jetta

All these cars are great performers, certainly more worthy than a cavalier.<br><br>
