            I actually started looking at the Elantra about 3 years ago in it's previous body style. I noticed more and more of them on the road , and started talking with the owners when I had the chance.  Those people had no complaints , so when the redesign came through in 2001 , I did the same thing , and did a lot of research on the internet , and by buying car magazines. Everything that I read was favorable , and Hyundai just keeps putting out better and better products with each successive model year.
  I took the 2003 Elantra out on about 4 separate occasions over the last 3 months , trying the 5 speed manual and the automatic several times before coming to a decision. I thought the manual drove in a more sporty fashion (can take advantage of the power in the upper rpm range if you desire) , and I like the better control available with the stick.
 The car handles very well during normal driving with just a slight rolling in higher speed cornering. The cabin noise is almost non-existent--very quiet. It has plenty of pick up, multi adjustable seats , A/C , am/fm cassette (I got the cd player), several cup holders , tilt steering ,sunglasses holder, remote gas door ,trunk , and hood releases , interval wipers , driver's and passenger's airbags as well as side air bags , and all of this standard in a well designed sharp car with a huge warranty. I got mine out the door with tax  (with dealer discount and $1500 cash back) for $12600  (sticker was $14157 ). This particular car had the cruise/remotekeyless entry with alarm pkg. , and traction control/anti-lock brakes with 4 wheel disk brakes)
 I've had it for a month and just love this car. BTW , I had a 1991 Ford Probe before this that I traded in with 116,000 miles on it.
