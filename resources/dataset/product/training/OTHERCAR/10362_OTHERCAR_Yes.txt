            After Purchasing A used 2001 Tacoma Prerunner, Bone stock and driving it over a weekend the bank told me "For what your paying we can get you a NEW truck." If you have driven a TRD you will know how glad I was when I upgraded to the TRD package. I've had it for about 2 weeks and put around 500 miles on it so far and have found only one small flaw. Overall the truck is perfect. The suspension is very responsive, sturdy, and the truck has a great stance. Anything before 2001 has these door panels with just a handle to open and shut the doors, very minimal. In the 2001 they upgraded to look more like a car witch I think is very nice. I would also agree with every one else that the power that the 3.4 liter V6 puts out is great, any time you need power it is there, on command. The only small flaw I have with the truck is the new electronic inigtion(there is no distribter). When you turn the key, it seems like the truck does not want to start. Overall I could not be more happy with my new Tacoma.
