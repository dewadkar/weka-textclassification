             I recently bought a black 2001 Swift in automatic. I previously drove a 1990 Pontiac Firefly(a cousin to the Swift), so I have something to compare my new car to. The 2001's are very refined than the previous model. 
 
 With the addition of features like power steering and larger tires, the ride is both relatively smoother and quieter. I enjoy just touring around the city and, although the Swift is one of the smallest cars on the road, I don't even get the feeling of being bombarded by larger, more powerful SUV's. The only quirk I have is that although the Swift's come with a more powerful engine, both merging with highway traffic or acceleration from a stop require double-digit seconds.
 
 When I was in the market for a new car, there were only a few cars to choose from. I did look at the Accent, but not only was it slightly more expensive, but I still need a couple more years before I buy into their "redemption" plan. The Swift was the only car for me, fitting into my budget quite nicely amidst repayments to my student loan.  

PS: I will update this opinion as the winter approaches(a Canadian winter mind you).

UPDATE
 The Canadian winter that I had been waiting for has come and gone. My Swift performed as expected with no problems to report during those cold winter months. The only quirk I had was driving on snow-covered roads. Because the Swift is relatively light in weight and has relatively small tires, I found myself treading fairly lightly when turning corners--as the tires tended to lose their grip fairly easily on slippery surfaces. The standard all-season Goodyear tires that came with the car did perform fairly well on all other road conditions. But I think for next winter, I will invest in some winter tires for improved handling and driving performance.
