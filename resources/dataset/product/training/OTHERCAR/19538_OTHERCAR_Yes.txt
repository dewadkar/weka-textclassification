            Toyota Tercel is a small compact that gives excellent gas mileage. The 
overall design is simple and pleasing to the eye. 
Tercel gives a smooth ride with no jarring or feeling of bumps. The one 
complaint is that the seats could be more comfortable for the driver who does long trips.
Toyota Tercel can be compared to the Dodge Neon in size and fuel efficiency.
Average price for the Tercel with minor options , around $21,000.
This vehicle is designed for single, married and small families. It seats four very comfortably. It also comes with a spacious trunk, and fold down rear seats.
A well designed car for the money it has a reputation for being a very low 
maintenance car, a major reason for my purchase.
Cloth seats may be a problem for families with children regarding spills
that could stain.<br><br>
