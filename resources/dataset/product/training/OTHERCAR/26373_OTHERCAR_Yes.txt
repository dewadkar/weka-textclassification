            We purchased the Subaru Impreza as a replacement for a 12 year old Honda which was on it's last legs. I'd actually been looking for an outback, but got such a great deal on this car, that we took it (and will be purchasing an outback when the new model year comes in).

I'll start by saying that the car is nice to drive. It has great traction, a small turning radius and handles well in slippery conditions.  It feels more like a European car than either an American or Japanese car. Of the cars I've owned or driven, the ride is most comparable to a Volkswagon.  In my opinion, the handling and safety features are *the* reasons to buy this car. It also holds it's value and is therefore a reasonably good investment.

Other things which are important to me in a vehicle are fuel economy, capacity and comfort. In these areas, the Subaru Impreza is better than average, but does not compare to either of my old cars. My Honda acord, even at 12 years, got better gas milage (the Impreza averages about 20 mpg, the accord, 24, my old 1982 VW rabbit, near 40 MPG).  The interior space was also better in both the Honda and VW.  The Impreza fits us now, with 2 adults and 2 small children, but at 11, my daughter is already somewhat cramped in the back seat.  The seats themselves, however, are nicely designed and very comfortable.

Things I like less about the Impreza: The car is lacking in things I've taken to be standard amenities- a light in the trunk, an alarm which lets you know you've left your lights on or your keys in the ignition, and driver lock-out proofing.  All of these are standard on the Honda and VW, and lacking on the Subaru.  It also has about the most badly designed cup holder I've ever seen (unless you like to wash your cds with coffee).  The Impreza also has a less luxurious feel than other cars in it's class and price range (again, I'd say it compares poorly to the Honda and VW).

If you can live without these amenities, it's a very good car, and currently the only one in the price range to offer all wheel drive. So if you really do off road driving, or frequently deal with treacherous conditions, it's definately worth a look. If you do mostly city driving, I'd recommend the Accord over it, or if you are willing to spend about $6,000 more, the VW passat.
