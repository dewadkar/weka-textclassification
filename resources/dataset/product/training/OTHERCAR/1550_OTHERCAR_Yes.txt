            I just purchased the Canon PowerShot S45 about a month ago and have to say that I am just about 100% happy with it. I have always been a Kodak or Pentax user so this is my first Canon.  

I will start with the only couple of cons that I have found so far and believe me, they are not that major. The first one is the removable "door" that covers the outlet on the camera. This door does not seem to have a very good design. I feel as though I'm going to break it off each time I have to get into the plug receptors. What Canon has it doing is lifting straight up with no sliding to the right or left or twisting to the right or left. It stays right above the outlet and I feel as though I'm manipulating it beyond a good point when I need to plug the camera in. I read the other reviews and found a couple of other reviewers who also felt this way so I know it's not just me.

Another con that didn't affect me but should be noted is the very small initial storage unit (only 32 mg) that comes with the camera. This didn't affect me because I made sure to purchase a camera that used the same storage units as my old Kodak DC280 so I have plenty of storage units. This camera and the Kodak use a compact flash card.  Before you can really get going taking photos, you will have to purchase a larger compact flash card or you will have to constantly download your photos and delete the flash card to have more room. This is not a feasible option if you are on vacation.

Lastly, the software that came with it is not all that great.  It does have a very quick download to your computer, much quicker than my old DC280 (time difference was 30 minutes for 20 photos on my old camera to about 3 minutes with this new one).  You will want other photo programs to work with your photos if you want to do anything fancy with them.

Those aside, this is a great camera. I love the ease with which it takes photos. I would highly recommend it for those who just want to point and shoot with a digital because it is so easy to use. You can leave the camera on auto and it does everything that a person needs for regular pictures.  The great thing is that for the more professional photographers there are a lot of other options on the camera as well. For example, there is a portrait setting that actually blurs the background and makes for quite a nice picture.  

The battery is amazing. I have not had it get low or die on me at all in the month I have been using it and I have already used it a whole lot. I read the other reviews where people were complaining about the battery on this camera and I have to strongly disagree with them.  They really might want to ask for another battery from they company. There could have been a bad lot because this one has been great. I've even been taking the movie clips and it doens't die.  I am very impressed. My old camera used to die a whole lot quicker.

For the details on this camera:  it has 4.1 megapixels (all you really need, anything more is over kill. This will enlarge to an 8x10 with no problems.), 3x optical zoom lens, a compact flash storage unit of 32 mg, battery and charger, two CD's with the programs to run the camera on your computer, and the cable to attach it to your computer.

One warning that I missed when purchasing this camera was that it does NOT include an AC adapter.  It is availble for seperate purchase and I highly recommend doing this for a back up. I plan on ordering one soon because I forgot to get it with the camera.

Overall, I highly recommend this camera. The pictures are fabulous even when you blow them up to 8x10 size.  The camera is a small compact size and much lighter then my Kodak DC280.  This camera will suit all your needs whether you are new to taking pictures or an old pro!

Merry Christmas!
