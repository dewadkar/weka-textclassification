            But don't expect to get much more than what you paid for it.  I bought this camera refurbished for about $100 because I wanted a digital camera and didn't have a lot of extra cash.  I've used it for about two months and like to bring it when I go on trips or to certain events.  The most annoying thing about the Epson PhotoPC 650 is that it's BIG.  It's not convenient to carry and it doesn't fit in your pocket.*  

*(Unless you're one of those "skaters" that wears huge pants with huge pockets.  However, I must warn you in advance... all of you who say "Oh. I wear huge pants with huge pockets! I can get the Epson PhotoPC 650 and it won't be a problem!" will probably find that the weight of the camera might pull your huge skater pants down to your ankles if they're not already there.)

The image quality for this camera is quite good.  it takes pics w/ resolutions up to 1152x864 with 1.09 megapixels.  The images look very clear once pulled up on your monitor.  

This camera does not have a zoom feature.  That's the major reason why I'd like to sell it and get a new one.  (If you want zoom, don't get this camera.)

One of the bright spots to my purchase is that my camera was accompanied by this little LexarMedia USB card adapter.  This allows you to easy plug your memory card into the port/adapter and it attaches as a removable disk drive.  ...Very convenient.  

All in all, I can't complain about this camera.  I didn't have a lot to spend and when I decided I wanted a digital camera, I wanted one FAST.  It's done its job and now I'm ready to move on to something better.
