            My husband and I bought our first Saturn in 1994 because we were tired of driving used wrecks. We wanted something dependable at a good price. We
had heard about Saturn's reputation of great customer service, and that was very important to me. Everyone has the image of the car salesman
trying every trick in the book to swindle you and I wanted to avoid that at all costs. The salesperson we met with was not pushy at all. She wanted this to be our decision and she made it very easy for us. After walking in the dealership, we drove out in a Saturn two days later. Since then the car is still running great and has only needed regular maintenance. What I love is that I can take it into the dealer and tell them how many miles I have and they'll perform the appropriate service. I'm not worried about them talking me into things I don't need. I totally trust them to do only what's needed and they do it right. They're up front with you at all times
and I've never had that sinking feeling that they're going to rip me off.
We now own a second Saturn , which we also love and we'll continue to buy Saturns as long as they keep making them. They're well built and economical to drive and own. I just wish they made a mini-van. <br><br>
