            I have a 95 Saturn SL1 that I just recently paid in full.  I love my Saturn because it is the perfect size for a mom of two girls.  I do mostly city driving and I don't need a big luxury car to take my small children around town.  The dealers were the most friendliest car salesmen I have ever come across.  

The customer service follow up is quite impressive.  They address any and all concerns in a very timely manner.  I bought a 94 Saturn SL1 and had an unfortunate, rare problem with it.  I returned the Saturn after it was not meeting my expectations of being &quot;fixed&quot;.  I spoke with the general manager's manager and they put me in a 95 Saturn and my car payment went DOWN!!!!  They were very apologetic as the problem with the 94 Saturn was one they hadn't encountered before.  I could not have asked for better service nor could I have asked for a better group of people to have taken care of me and my car needs.  

The Saturn &quot;Homecomings&quot; are a wonderful idea, and it is neat to see a whole bunch of people driving the same cars and what's even better is knowing that they are all satisfied with their car as much as you are.  The only thing that I have a slight problem with is the brakes.  Although their brakes aren't hazardous, they due tend to need repairing sooner than other compact cars.  The Saturn dealers will probably tell you this before purchasing a Saturn.<br><br>
