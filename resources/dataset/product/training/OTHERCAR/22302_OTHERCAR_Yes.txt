            we purchased a 1991 mazda MPV and put 148,000 miles on it before we had an accident last month and it was considered totalled.  we fully expected to keep it two more years.  repairs were minimal over the 9 years, except for a new transmission at about 115,000.

when we looked for a new car, i was leaning toward the chevy venture, because a friend recommended it and i respect his opinion.  we drove the venture, then the chrysler town &amp; country, then the mazda mpv and finally the honda minivan.  we thought the MPV was small, and it is about the same size as the NONextended chevy and chrysler.

but when we saw and felt the extreme differences in quality and engineering, between the MPV and the two american vans, that part was a very easy decision.  the honda was OK but didn't seem as well thought-out.  availability was a problem, and dealers were charging at least the full invoice price.

it just wasn't a difficult decision.  we have three kids ages 13, 9 and 5 and each is involved in MANY activities.  the car has to be comfortable and durable for all the shuttling around town.  everything about the car is tight and nicely designed.  handling is very car-like.  the MPV was also the best looking of the bunch (but i guess that is a subjective decision), is a brand new body style, and we got a GREAT price.

the improvements were many, and some of the things we liked in the 1991 MPV were still familiar in the 2000 one.  i might like another 20 horsepower, and the gear ratios are a little close, but those issues pale when you consider what a great vehicle it is.  contact me in 10 years and i will let you know how it is going  :-)
