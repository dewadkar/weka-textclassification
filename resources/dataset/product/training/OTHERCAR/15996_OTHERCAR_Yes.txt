            I absolutely love this Previa.  I just bought it in May.  It had 125k original miles.  The front differential was replaced at 130K, which the guy at the dealership said was standard on these Previas.  I got an awesome deal at the used car lot where I bought it because I fixed the differential.  It runs like a champ and has so much room that even my seven adult friends and their cargo are impressed.  I can sleep in the back!  

What I really love about this is that it can double as a truck because of the fold-up wayback seats (no need to remove a bench, since there are no benches, thank God!).

I bought an All-Trac LE with four swiveling captain's chairs (oh, it's heaven with kids!) and a power-packed factory CD stereo system.  I must say that Toyota thought of everything on this vehicle, and I can't imagine how they could improve.  I'm also really glad that I *don't* have two sliding doors on this because that always seemed like a safety hazard with young children, or even older children.  

I have hauled 28 huge bags of beauty bark and three adults up a steep incline, with no problems.  It may be 4 cylinder, but the overdrive feature gives it a lot more power and durability.  I have moved many loads of furniture, salvation army runs, groceries for large families, and my entire family with grandma on long trips.  

Another thing too is that it is highly maneuverable.  My friends who ride with me are all amazed at how nimble it is for a minivan.  It's tall and not wide like every other van (including the newer Toyotas), so I can get it in and out of some really tight spots easily.  Toyota people are genius on this car.

I am extremely proud to be a member of the Previa Cult (as the guy at the dealership put it) and plan on keeping my almost 13 year old tried and true Toyota until it dies!
