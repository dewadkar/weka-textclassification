            I've owned my VW Golf GLS 1.8T for 2 years now and I still love it.  I got it with the luxury, winter, Monsoon and, of course, the Turbo Packages.  I did want sports suspension and I didn't want Monsoon, but after 2 weeks of searching the sales woman at Hudson Valley VW told me that this was all they were likely to find.  She seemed very professional and I believe she really tried to find the car I wanted.  

My old car was a 1988 VW Golf GL and I really liked that car.  It was pretty darn dependable until the oil light started coming on for no good reason.  This persisted even after I had the oil pump replaced with a new one.  Other than the looks, the new Golf bears little resemblance to the '88.  The ride is much nicer even than when to old one was new.  

There are a lot of mountains where I live.   Turbo charging the engine has allowed me to now take them at highway speed.  The engine is awesome.  Also, one of my pet peeves has always been trying to get onto highways in New York City with a little VW.  My 1.8T is quick off the mark and I don&#146t have that problem any more.  I've heard other people complain about the turbo lag but all of my VW's have had engine lag.  With the 1.8T there is a split second of hesitation and then zoom.  Furthermore, that lag all but disappears if you use premium fuel.  

I like hatchbacks.  I wanted a car that's as much like a station wagon as it can get...without being a station wagon.  The golf has lots of storage space and can seat 4 adults without a problem.  You won't even feel their weight on the engine going up hills.  The rear seats fold down completely flat.  I've never owned a car with a cup holder before and I like that too.  There are a few little touches that add to the fun like the mini sun visor over the rear view mirror.

Although VW recommends Premium fuel my dealer told me that it would run fine with regular as long as you filled it with mid grade every fourth fill up.  I'm driving with low grade right now and I'm not having any problems.  I've gotten about 32 miles to the gallon with a combination of city and highway driving.  There is a definite difference when you fill it up with premium.  The car is more powerful and responsive and like I said, &#147the engine lag disappears.&#148

This is my 5th VW and my 3rd Golf.  Initially I didn't like all of the power options but they do grow on you.  I also don't like the car beeping every time the security system arms itself.  I've got to find some way to turn that horn off.  The car beeps every time you lock the doors.  My retired neighbors don't like that and neither do I.  When I go down to New York City I also don't like the car calling attention to itself as I walk away from it.  The Monsoon Speaker System is annoying.  Who need that much bass to listen to NPR, ELO or They Might be Giants?  I've set the bass to -8 and that sounds good.

My on-going problem has been the cruise control shutting off when I start up hills or hit a bump in the road.  I brought it to VW with the problem.  They looked at it.  Test drove it and said that they couldn&#146t find why this was happening.  After that the problem went away but resurfaced a few months later.  It&#146s not a big problem.  Another problem was the engine smoking after driving it for 3 months.  I added oil and after the oil was changed at 6,000 miles the problem was solved.  I think VW is way off the mark in suggesting oil changes every 6,000 miles instead of every 3,000.  Hudson Valley VW agrees with me and has told me to have the oil changed between their services.  

My other on-going problem has been changing those $18 head light bulbs.  It cost $36 for a technician to change one.  It&#146s a huge pain in the bottom to get around the battery on the drivers side.  Being that the lights are on whenever you&#146re driving they burn out with greater frequency.  Finally, I&#146ve found that when one signal light goes out within 2 months they&#146ll all go out.  So, just have them all replace one time.  This has happened to me twice.

The biggest problem I had was when the control switch for the heated seats short-circuited on the passenger seat.  The switch was very hot and I couldn&#146t even turn off the heat with the ignition off.  I was in Princeton, NJ at the time.  I drove to Princeton Volkswagen and their people were downright rude.  The service personnel thought I was being unreasonable not to leave the car for four days so that they could check the entire electrical system.  So, I asked if they&#146d tell me how to remove the switch.  That way the battery wouldn&#146t die and the car wouldn&#146t catch fire. In an aggressive and condescending manner I was told that if I removed the switch it would void my warranty.  Luckily I didn&#146t have to work that morning.  I took a road trip to Volkswagen in Edison, NJ.  The service manager said that he was very busy and most likely wouldn&#146t have time to look at it that day.  I thanked him, but as I was leaving he asked me to pull the car around to the service bay.  A technician removed the switch for me in under a minute.  Yes, he did burn his hand on the switch; it was so hot.  They told me to have the system checked and the switch replaced when I got home.  Hudson Valley Volkswagen replaced it the morning I brought it in and I haven&#146t had a problem with it since.  I would not buy a Volkswagen if I lived in Princeton, NJ unless I enjoyed visiting angry, depressed people.
 
Overall, I&#146m still enjoying this car.  The people in the service department at Hudson Valley Volkswagen are friendly and professional.  My care is great on hills and merging into busy traffic.  It&#146s also easy to maneuver on congested city streets and winding country lanes.  This is not the econobox of the 80's it's a very nice automobile and I'm glad I bought it.
