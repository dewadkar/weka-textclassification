            I bought the Exilim EXS2 (2.1 megapixel) at Walmart. All the physical stuff is perfect, but the picture quality is bad. I have a Fujifilm 6800Z (3.3 megapixel) and I was looking for a very small camera for backpacking treks. Comparing the two image qualities for outdoor photos shows clearly that the Casio takes very poor outdoor images. I had the Casio setup on the best image quality. The distant scenery is blurry, like it is out of focus. This was a brand new sealed unit, no smudges on the lense. The image quality is actually not as good as one taken with my ancient Sony FD-81 Mavica (0.3 megapixel on a floppy disk).

Indoor flash images are real good and closeups are OK.

To add insult to injury, the identical 1280 x960 image taken with the Casio was 650K, and only 275K on the Fuji. So my Fuji will store more than twice as many, far superior images than the Casio on the same size memory card.

Here are the three images for you to compare:

I emailed the three images to Casio tech support and asked what was wrong with my camera.
