            My commute has been terrible since 1995.  First it was SF to San Jose, then it was San Jose to Berkeley, and then San Jose to SF.  The obvious question (besides 'WHY?'), is 'what car could handle the stress?'  The answer: My Saturn SL1. It has really responded well.  

It was tough at the end of '96 to decide whether to get a Civic LX or a Saturn SL. The two cars were almost exactly the same price, Consumer Reports had them rated at roughly the same quality, and I had friends who owned each car that each were highly satisfied. 

I ended up getting the SL1 for a couple of reasons. First, it seemed like someone, somewhere, had put extra thought into the usabilty of every feature, especially the engine layout and dash layout.  

Second, I like the no-haggle approach.  I should qualify this statement, though. Although the Saturn  dealer didn't haggle on pricing, he did hard-sell us on protective coatings and an alarm system, neither of which ultimately has been useful.  

There are some drawbacks to my SL1. The car lacks power (you can make it up by getting the SL2) but with the manual version, it really hasn't been a problem, even on fully loaded trips up to Tahoe. The car is also not very sexy.  A Saturn SL1 (or SL2) really shouldn't be on your radar screen if you are looking for a Miata.  Basically, you should get a Saturn SL1 only if you want a reliable car for commuting and road trips.  

The service record has been good.  Saturn tries to get you to come in every 3000 miles, and that was a little too expensive for me, so I've been coming in every 6000 or 7000 miles.  At 65000 miles, there was a crack in the gasket, and even though the car was no longer under warranty, Saturn decided it was a defect and replaced it for free.  I haven't had any problems other than that, despite the wear and tear of 40,000 miles per year. 

Overall, it's been a great experience, and I've even gotten to be in some Saturn commercials.
