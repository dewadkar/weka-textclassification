            I bought my 1991 Mirage Hatchback used, for 4,000 dollars.  Little did I know that this would be the best deal of my life.  The car had low mileage for its year, the gas tank holds around 9 gallons, and a tank lasts 250 miles.  This is the best part of all.

Other benefits to this funny looking little car (looks like a big rollerskate) are that since I bought it two years ago, August, I haven't had to have any work done.  The car tools along without so much as a single mishap.  I live in Chicago, where the winters are unbearably cold, and the thing starts up like a charm every time.  I once dug it out of three feet of snow, and it caught the first turn of the key.

Our summers are hot.  Still, it starts and keeps going.  The air conditioning cools her off in about ten minutes, and the heat is cozy near seven minutes.

If a small car that isn't fancy is good enough for you, then this car is definitely a great purchase.  It is a worry free, fun way to get around.  Its kind of like riding in a really fast, quite reliable go-cart!<br><br>
