            I have owned 3 Jaguars in a row and I can honestly say that this is the best Jag ever.  The 95 boasts performance from its 6 cylinder engine that rivals any V-8 Ive driven.  It seduces and coddles you into fast easy driving and takes curves that you swear would make other cars beg for mercy.  The brakes are exemplary and all the handy electronic reminders make sure that you wont make mistakes.  The only thing I wish this Jaguar lacks that the newer ones have is the automatic headlights.  Otherwise I cant heap enough compliments on my dealer who either picks my car up for service or lends me a car when its in the shop.  I also love the exclusivity of owning a JAG instead of a Benz or Bimmer<br><br>
