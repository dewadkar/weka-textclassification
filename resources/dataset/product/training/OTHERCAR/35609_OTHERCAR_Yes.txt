            We bought a 1998 Malibu LS in August 1998.  We wanted to buy a car for under $20k so we could easily finance for four years.  We felt like the Malibu was the best car for the money after extensive research.  We don't regret it!  We paid 17k for our Malibu loaded with every available option except leather and sunroof.  The only problems we have had are brakes and battery.  The brakes have weak front rotors that have warped twice on us.  We are told it is because we changed our own front tire and didn't have a torque wrench.  The dealer turned the rotors the first time under warranty but within 10,000 miles they were warped again.  When it's time for a brake jos I will just replace the rotors with better quality.  The battery simply corroded and the terminals broke off.  This was fixed by the Dealer under warranty.  Overall I would recommend the Malibu for anybody who wasn't a good deal.  Our car had about 22,000 miles on it right now and running strong with no problems.<br><br>
