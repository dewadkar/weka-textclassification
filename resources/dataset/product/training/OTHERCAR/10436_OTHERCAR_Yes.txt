            I bought this car new in 1990 for $13,500. I now have over 250,000 miles on it and NO major mechanical defects!  It has traveled all over the United States and never have I been let down.  If you are looking for a car that will go forever.  This is the one.  Its ride is a little noisy at Highway speeds, but the double overhead cam 4 cylinder provides great acceleration, and the suspension makes one think they are in a much more expensive sports car.  This car is for the buyer who enjoys quality without the high price tag.  I would highly recommend it for those who wont use the back seat (not much room there).  If you are a college student looking for a car I would strongly recommend one.  Try to find one with miles between 100000 and 150000.  If you do, you will have many years of driving and dependability to come.<br><br>
