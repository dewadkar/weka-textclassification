            VW Jettas all stink!  They drive terribly and fall apart the instant you leave the dealership!  At least that is what happened to me.  Before long the car started falling apart.  Transmission blew before I had even racked up 600 miles on the car... then other engine troubles, performance issues, I really do regret leasing my Jetta and I cannot wait until Sept of 2001 when the lease is up and I get to turn it in for something better... heck, anything will be better than my Jetta.  I could get a used Yugo with 200,000 miles on it, and I would probably have fewer problems and better performance with that than I have with my Jetta.

What a piece of garbage.  I will never again in my life recomment the Jetta, or any VW car for that matter, to anyone, well, maybe my enemies.. nah, thats too cruel!<br><br>
