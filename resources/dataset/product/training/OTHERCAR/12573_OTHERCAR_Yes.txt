            I wanted a sports car but at the time did not have a lot of money.  After looking at what was available I bought an Acura GS coupe and I am glad I did.  It has pretty good acceleration from the start and is great at cornering.  I like its sleek lines and it has been a very reliable vehicle.  Even though it gets heavy usage it has only been in for standard maintenence except for a couple of minor problems.

It is not overly expensive to operate and gets decent gas mileage.  I would definately recommend this car to anyone who wants a sports car experience at an affordable price.<br><br>
