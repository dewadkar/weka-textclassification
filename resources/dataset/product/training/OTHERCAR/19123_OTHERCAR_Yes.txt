            I have been a happy owner of a colorado red vw passat for the past year and have grown to love it more with each passing month.  When searching for a vehicle, my wife and i decided we wanted a mid-sized sedan for our next car as we were moving far from home and have a rather large dog to tote around.  Both of us enjoy driving and have a preference for foreign cars.  I test drove several other vehicles in this class including the accord, camry, galant and even a couple outside of our target like the sebring convertible and passport.  The passat won me over from the start for performance and styling but sold me on attention to detail.  After a year, I am happy to say it has not dissappointed.  This car handles extremely well.  It gives the driver a remarkable feel for the road and comfortable cornering feedback.  I opted for the turbo 4 for $$ reasons. The 6 cylinder was a $2300 dollar option, and in driving both I did not feel that was enough bang for the buck.  The 150 horse 4 is plenty of power for me and the turbo reacts fairly quickly, however there is more than noticeable lag when the ac is on.  The Tiptronic trans was a great compromise for my wife and I as i prefer a manual shift.  I must admit, I seldom use the manual option, but it is good fun when I do! Comfort level is high in the standard seats which do include lumbar adjusts. The finish features are excellent on this car with rubber moldings on door bottoms to keep the interior rockers free of debris, well lit and placed power controls, exceptional stereo with optional 6 disc cd, telescopic wheel, rear headrests, side airbags, and very tasteful interior design to name a few.  I also opted for the luxury package which includes alloy wheels(including the spare!), sunroof and rear sunshade.  Suprises for me are the excellent 4 wheel disc brakes and cavernous trunk, both of which seemed to me to be far superior to all others I looked at.  The ride is superior and quite and styling is excellent.  My only 2 complaints are the pathetic cupholders (which seem very flimsy and can hold nothing larger than a 12 oz. can) and the way the seat material collect and hold onto lint - if at all possible, go for the leather seats.  I would reccomend this car to anyone who seriously loves to drive.  This is no cadillac, so if you want to detach yourself from the road - go for a Camry.  But if you are like me and can appreciate a stylish sedan that still gives you a great feel for the road - buy it!  Not to be forgotten is the excellent warranty which covers all maintenance for the 1st 2 years.  Using 2 different dealerships in different states, I am happy to report I have received excellent service at both.
