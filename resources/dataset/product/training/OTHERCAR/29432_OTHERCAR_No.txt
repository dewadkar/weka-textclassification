                 The number one thing I liked about this car was it's looks, other then that it, well to put it bluntly it sucked. It was a slow car with no power on tap. The pannels dented easily and where hard and costly to repair. The engine blew...alot. 
     The engine originally blowing was a faulty radiator hose, then I replaced the engine. Again the engine blew when I put in Bosch +4 plugs, and about 10,000 miles later the pistions had holes cooked through them. The car was extremely slow, a '80's fort escort cooked me! No, not a G.T. either, it wasn't the greatest feeling in the world.
     The interior plastics broke easily and the tire jack bent. On a good note the interior was great for the driver and the up front passenger. The controls where easily reached, and the seats held you in your place. The rear seats where comfortable but there wasn't enough room to fit any one but young children back there. The trunk area had good enough space to fit my two 12" and one 15" subwoofer. But there was no room to fit the amps. (Luckily enough the 15 was a free air so the amps where stored underneath.) The car was quiet, and had very little ghetto rattle. But still it was slow!
