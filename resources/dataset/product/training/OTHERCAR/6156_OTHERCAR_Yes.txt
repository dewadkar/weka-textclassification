            We drove a Chevy Venture as a rental vehicle on two occasions.  I found the ride to be much better than Chevy's original minivan, the Astro, but still not as nice as the Chrysler minivans.  The warning about the electronic sliding door concerned me.  There is supposedly a safety mechanism built into the door, which is intended to prevent injury should something cross its path while closing, but Chevrolet warns that it could still cause some injury.  It just so happened that a friendly but nosey dog tried to climb into the van while the door was shutting the last time we rented one.  The dog was not hurt, but he was clearly shaken.  With four children of my own, I would not own a Venture with an electronic sliding door.

In comparing the Venture with Chrysler's Voyager, I found the Voyager to have more interior room.  However, the Venture does have a higher fuel tank capacity at 25 gallons, versus Voyager's 19 gallon tank.  The Venture has a slightly larger V6 engine as well as higher horsepower and torque.  Fuel economy is almost identical with a city/hwy average of 18 MPG on the Voyager and 19 MPG on the Venture.

I concede that for what appears to be an imitation of what Chrysler originated, The Chevy Venture compares very well to the Voyager.  The deciding factor is left up to individual preference.  I remain partial to the Chrysler line of minivans.<br><br>
