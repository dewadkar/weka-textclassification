            Ive had this camera for about 6 months now, and its been great.  It takes awesome outdoor photos, very good color quality and sharpness.  It takes very good low light photos, the lens picks up a ton of ambient light.  This effect in conjunction with the flash is too much, so you have to turn the flash settings down as low as possible.  Indoor photos you almost always have to have the flash on to get a sharp photo.  But I dont really take indoor photos, I wanted it to take on trips to take scenic pictures and stuff, and so this camera works out perfect.  The functions are fine, everything that I need, without too much navigation to add effects or navigate photos etc.  The camera is a bit bulky, but has a very solid feel to it, which I like.  I chose this camera because I wanted a digital CAMERA, with an emphasis and focus on good optics and clarity of photos, not on some tiny thing that fits in the palm of your hand.  That wasnt my intent at all.  So the 3040 was perfect for me, the size is that of a regular camera, and feels nice in the hand.  The optics are great.  My biggest complaints are that it comes with a dinky 16mb card (but I think everyone should have a 128mb card, which no camera comes with, so you'd have to upgrade anyways) instead of at least a 32mb card.  Also it doesnt come with batteries/charger or an AC adaptor.  I bought the Monster batteries and charger and they work fine.  Battery life is dramatically decreased when you use the LCD screen a lot.  Another complaint is the lens cap.  It attaches to the inside of the lens thing, so that if you turn the camera on without taking off the lens cap, the lens tries to telescope out but is blocked by the cap, and the motor makes funny noises.  I knew about this before I bought the camera, and have been good about always taking off the cap, and it only happened once on accident.  Still, not a good design choice, there should be a sensor or something.  Also, the accessories like the AC adaptor, are expensive (but then again, they might all be, I'm not comparing it against another cameras accessories).  Last complaint is that when I take out the batteries to charge them, since I dont have the adaptor, all your menu settings get reset.  This is really annoying.  OK OK, that sounds like a lot of complaints, but in the end its a great camera, I would recommend it to friends, and Im glad I bought it.  I can live with all of the flaws, and Ive taked some great photos with it.  You can check some out at www.outsideinward.com from my China trip.  This is not the digital camera to get if you want to have something super portable to whip out at gatherings with your buddies.  But if you take a lot of outdoor or night photos, the 3040 is it.
