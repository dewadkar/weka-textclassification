            I bought my golf used in 1995 my first year in college &amp; let me tell you how strong this car &amp; all Volkswagon's are! I put over 100 miles everyday travelling to upstate NY for College &amp; work &amp; I hadn't had any problems. It's been to Canada twice - Ohio - Chicago - Michigan - Indiana - New Jersey - Pennsylvania - Philadelphia &amp; Connecticut three times &amp; it's still holding nicely. I love that it's stick shift 5 speed  &amp; that I have no problem finding a parking space b/c of it's compact size. Granted it's an 8 year old car soon to be 9 &amp; I bought it used but with the snow &amp; all the weather changes here in NYC - it's been great! I never got stuck in the snow b/c of the front wheel drive! Highly recommend any Volkswagon! <br><br>
