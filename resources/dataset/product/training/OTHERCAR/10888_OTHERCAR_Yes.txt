            After two months of shopping for a digital camera for Christmas for my best friend, I selected the Panasonic PV-DC2590 Palm Cam. My primary considerations were price and picture quality. Most vendors were willing to show me test shots from a variety of cameras - this was extremely beneficial. Do not hesitate to ask the computer/electronic stores to do this. We have a had great results and are well satisfied - it is so easy to send pictures to friends and relatives on the computer and the &quot;film&quot; can be used again and again. You can see the pictures as you take them and decide immediately if you want to keep them or take others instead. Beginners like us will find it very easy to use - directions are very clear.<br><br>
