            I recently test drove a Mazda Miata automatic.  Laying in the showroom was a beautiful green Miata limited.  It looked very nice with its 5-spoke chrome wheels and wood grain steering wheel and interior.  The one I drove was dug out of the back by the salesman and it was not as nice as the showroom car at all.  It was a base automatic and it was the only one in stock.  The optional hardtop was on the car when I drove it and made the car look more sporty.  When i sat in it I had to bend my thighs under the steering wheel to get through. My friend (5' 11&quot;) could bearly get in and when getting out he had to pull one leg at a time out to get out safely.  Only the smallest and fittest should buy this vehicle.  The sound system was mediocre with its tweeters and midranges on the door.  When I got out of the driveway I kind of pushed it hard seeing if the rear end would slip.   Nothin!!  I floored it on the highway and it took off  slower than my 97 civic ex.  It made a sound like a rocket takin off at the 5000-6000 rpm range.  On the highway it seems peppy, but not at low speeds.  I was very dissapointed.  The steering column wasn't even a tilting or telescoping one, but a fixed one making it even harder to get in and out of the car.  Once I got back I told the salesman about the slow acceleration.  He says the manual transmission is much faster at a 0-60 time of 6.3 seconds.  I seriously doubt it.  An automatic trans usually slows the car's 0-60 time down by about a second.  The auto a drove felt like a 0-60 of about 9-10 seconds.  Thats slow as hell and they call it a sports car. The price is also very high at 23,000 base and close to 28-30,000 loaded.  Thats outrageous.  I left the lot in rage and disgust.  

I didn;t get to put the top down because of the hardtop being bolted down to it.  <br><br>
