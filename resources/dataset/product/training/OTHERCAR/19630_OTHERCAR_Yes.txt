            I have used an Olympus Stylus Infinity (film) camera for years, and wished that Olympus made a comparable digital camera. Now they do, with the Camedia series now out. Our local Costco has them in bubble packs for $149, and that's how we found it.

This Camedia D-150 Zoom is about the same size, and has about the same features, as the old Stylus Infinity. It is just about as easy to use. It features auto focus, auto exposure, and four different flash modes. It has 3X optical plus 2X digital zooms, which is all anyone needs for a point-and-shoot digital camera. Even though it is "only" 1.3 megapixel, that is enough for very high quality photos. We usually use its lowest resolution for photos to email and they are plenty sharp and detailed.

The included software works very well. Just plug in the USB cable and the software opens automatically, you name the file you want the pictures in, select the ones you want transferred, and if you specify, erase them from the camera as part of the process. 

I have no complaints about this camera. I think it is the perfect simple digital camera for casual use, and isn't overpriced. Olympus has been making fine cameras for a long, long time, and this one is a fine addition to their lineage.
