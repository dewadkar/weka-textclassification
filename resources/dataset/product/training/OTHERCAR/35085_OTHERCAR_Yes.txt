            I was looking for 4 wheel drive, affordable, dependable transportation that could carry a little freight.  The Subaru Outback Sport is a dream come true.

If you've ever had an older Suburu - maybe a Loyale from the 80s, you'll be amazed at the power, maneuverability and chic of these newer editions to the Subaru line.  When I put my foot down on the excelerator it responds, even going up hills at 70 or 75 mph (shhh! don't tell the cops!). 

It's unbeatable in the snow, dirt and mud.  The All Wheel Drive system is a no-brainer.  I don't need to determine when to change to 4 wheel drive; it senses that the wheels are slipping and it automatically transfers the power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip.

This is my first car with anti-lock brakes and they've kept me from uncontrollably skidding more than once. 

The inside is comfortable, although not a lot of leg room in the back seat.  The back seat flips down for more freight capacity.  Other than freight room, there isn't a lot of storage: the glove compartment is small, no storage between the front seats and no little pockets or slots in or under the dash.  There is a double cup holder that pulls out from the dash, but it blocks controls to the heat and radio once there are cups in it.

Controls are well positioned and easy to use.  The stereo/CD player isn't enough to impress real audiophiles, but it's fine for the average listener.  

The exterior appearance is like a standard Impreza Wagon with a testosterone injection.  Its gray euro-panels, beefy bumpers and raised air intake on the hood give a look to be reckoned with.   <br><br>
