            My 1998 Hyundai Accent is my first car (well, aside from my dad's Nova that I learned to drive on), and I love it!  It's an adorable little car that does its job well.  I've put a lot of miles on it in the last year and a half just driving the hour between school and home every couple of weeks, plus all the little excursions and road trips that happen in your college career.  It doesn't eat gas like some cars do- I usually fill it up at home, drive back to school, and drive it around town for about two weeks before I have to fill it again.  Seriously.  

It is a little small, however.  It's a great size for me, since I don't like driving big cars, but it doesn't go over well when six of us want to go out somewhere.  My friend had one too, and we once drove it from New York City to New Haven and back with six people in it, but it wasn't what I'd call comfortable.  And hey, I manage to fit a dorm room's worth of stuff in it every semester.  

I don't know a lot about cars technically, but I do know that this is a nice, fun to drive car that serves its purpose very well.<br><br>
