            I bought a 99 model integra at the beginning of the new year. I have never been so pleased with a car. The integra was part of a trade-in that I made. I owned an older acura ('88) and decided that now was the best time to make a trade. My first acura never gave me any problems, but it was time to up-date the car. I looked at several other cars such as the Honda accord, which I also like very much b/c it was made by the same company, but the more money I could get on my trade in was better. the sales man who dealt with me was also very pleasant and understanding that I am on a tight budget and could not pay huge amounts of money for a car. The integra get great gas mileage and it it well worth the cost.
