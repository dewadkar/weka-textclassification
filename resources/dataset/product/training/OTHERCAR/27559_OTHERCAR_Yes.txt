            I am writing an opinion on my 1996 Grand Jeep Cherokee. The model I own has 10-way power leather seats, and an upgraded V8 engine. This is a great vehicle for anyone, of any age (but a teen may find trouble buying one on his/her own). I have ridden mine all over the country, safely and comfortably. Mine came with a built in MTX Blue Thunder amplifier. The speakers and head unit are all Infinity Gold. The best color for the Grand Jeep Cherokee is black. 

The Jeep I have is good for any kind of driving at ny time of the year. even winter on the highways. Well, I hope you have enjoyed my opinion. Thanks for listening, bye.<br><br>
