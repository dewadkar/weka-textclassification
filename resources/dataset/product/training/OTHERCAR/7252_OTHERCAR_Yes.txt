            I loved the body style of the Mercury Cougar the first time I laid eyes on it.  It definitely is a head turner!!  I used to own a Ford Probe, but I wanted something a little sportier looking.  I got the car in April 1999.  The interior is very spacious, except for the back seat.  I love the way the seats hug your body.  The dash is nicely laid out, and perfectly situated so that it's easy to operate.  Cornering and braking in the Cougar is excellent, and it seems to hug the road.  It's just so fun to drive!

However, I've had a few problems with the electrical system in the car.  I've had it in the shop several times.  First all the airbag sensor light came on all the time.  The sensor had to be replaced.  Then all of sudden the radio had a lot of static.  At first they thought it was the speakers, but realized they had to replace the radio.  The radio has been replaced twice and now finally works fine.  I am now having problems with the trunk release.  It works very intermittently, but never seems to fail in the shop.  Also, the rear window defroster light blinks off and on, and the coolant light (coolant level is fine) comes on in the morning when I start the car, and doesn't go off until I stop and start it again.  I'm going to have the shop check the rear window defroster and coolant lights when I go in for the next oil change.

All in all, I really do love the car, and would recommend it. I am leasing this one, and at the end of the lease, if they can't get the bugs worked out, I'll either trade it in or possibly purchase another cougar.  I'm curious to know if anyone else has had any of these similar problems.<br><br>
