            Well, I am writing this review just short of 3 years of owning the car.

Way outdated for most buyers, but this is for those that might want to be looking into a used car.

Parts that have been replaced or need replaced during my ownership:
- Break pads (twice)
- Break shoes
- Front struts
- Front strut mounts
| A/C compressor
- Alternator
- Battery
- 4 tires

Currently, my car has less than 70,000 miles on it. Considering everything that has been replaced, one might think the car had 140,000 miles. This aspect of the car is very disappointing. The fact that I still own this car is also surprising.
Hopefully after all these fixes, the car will run for me for a tiny bit longer.

A few good things I can say about the car:  The engine has been very good to me, the seats are highly comfortable, and the trunk is quite large for the size of the car.
