            I recently purchased a 1999 Chevy Silverado regular cab, Z71, LS short box. What an outstanding new pick-up! I call it a pick-up, because when people call it a truck, I think of eighteen wheels, B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear. I used to love that show. But seriously. The new Silverado has been a breathe of fresh air to the old body style of the C/K series, mechanics, and overall appearance. I bought this pick-up because of the new innovations that were new to the market, styling, performance, and Chevrolet reliability. 

I love the fact this pick-up moves when asked. The new 325 cubic inch/270 horse power engine does not mess around. With enough horsepower and torque, there are no hesitations. My friends love driving it because it really throws you into the seat. Also, the new tow-haul feature does make necessary adjustments when hauling a big load. Nice feature. Although Chevrolet did not change the exterior dramatically like Ford (which has a nice design), it really appealed too me. There are some very subtle curves, bends, and lines that make it very soothing to the eyes. The new interior and fit and finish is excellent! About the only things I dislike are the cup holders and placement of the emergency brake. You have two, yes, two cup holders at the base of your right knee. Chevrolet has cut back with their number and placement of cupholders due to new interior changes. If you are tall like me, your knee is constantly rubbing/resting on it. Of course your cupholder is not always in the down position, unless you are chronically dehydrated. Finally, my pants are always getting caught on the emergency brake when I climb in. These are minor complaints, but they are noticeable. 

Driving the new Silverado is like driving a Cadillac, but with a more commanding view. The ride and stability of the new Silverado handles very nicely than prior Chevy models. Chevrolet has put more strength and emphasis into their frame this year, especially around the front end. This really gives the pick-up a tight frame and solid feel.  

Now, I'm sure there are fans that would prefer a Ford, Toyota, Dodge, or Nissan. I've been in just about every one and enjoyed them all, but I really prefer the new Chevy overall. If you are looking for new innovations, performance, towing/hauling, styling, and overall fun, then the new Chev Silverado is for you.
