            I leased my 1999 Accord Coupe about 9 months ago and I absolutlely love it!  I work in sales so I drive a lot and the car has been great.  It has excellent gas mileage and has had no problems whatsoever. 
It seemed a bit large when I first got it as compared to the 1990 Accord that I previously owned but I've gotten used to it. I was afraid of door dings and the like because it is quite wide but the car is actually extremely sturdy!  I was in a side impact car accident a few months ago that really damaged the other car, but my Accord only had a very small dent and scratch, I haven't even fixed it yet because it is so unnoticable.  I couldn't believe how well the car held up in the accident!
The ride is very smooth in this car, it can be kind of easy to drive way too fast sometimes.
I wouldn't reccommend this car as a family car, however, because the back seats are difficult to access being a 2-door car and all.  The seat belts are in the way when you try to get in the back and the seats are sometimes hard to move forward to allow people into the back.
Trunk space is great though, I can't believe how much I have piled into that car at once!<br><br>
