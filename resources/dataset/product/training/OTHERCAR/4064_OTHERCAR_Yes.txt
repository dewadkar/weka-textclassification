            What a great vehicle for a family!  The Chevy Venture has it all.  It's roomy, yet it drives easily and I have no problems getting around in it.  We purchased our Venture because we were looking for a vehicle to pull our popup camper with and we have never been disappointed.

The features of this van are great.  The dual sliding doors allow you to get in on both sides and provide easy access to the back for all passengers.  The power sliding door is a nice addition, especially with a baby or small child.  With the remote entry, I can have the door open as I am approaching the van, and this makes it easy to get my son in, especially in inclement weather.

We like the way the seats remove so easily.  When we camp, it makes loading up for a trip easy and there is room for everything.  Also great for camping is the built in air compressor.  It automatically balances the load of the trailer and extra weight of our belongings in the van.  Plus, it saves mom and dad from airing up pool toys and bicycle tires manually!  

The on board computer is a gadget my husband adores!  He is very interested in fuel mileage, especially on long trips.  The computer tells him all he needs to know and he loves to try to get better mileage each and every trip!

The little things...storage compartments, cup holders, cargo nets...it has all the little extra conveniences that make every trip a pleasure.  And for the added bonuses...the rear sound system with headphones is great when traveling.  My husband can listen to a CD or radio while I listen to a cassette, or vice versa.  As our children get older, this feature will definitely be a life saver!!

All in all, I will drive my Chevy Venture until the wheels fall off!!  It is a great vehicle, especially for families.  Thumbs up!!<br><br>
