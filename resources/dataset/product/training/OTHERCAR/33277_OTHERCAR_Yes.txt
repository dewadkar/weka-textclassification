            We bought our Voyager (Base model) 2 years ago. In that time we have taken numerous weekend trips, carpooled countless Girl Scouts and used it for our own *theater* while at the Drive-In. I LOVE mine! I probably said the same thing others did. Me? A mini van? Nahhh. Well,I'm reformed now. The only thing I would suggest to any one considering buying one is that if they are able to swing it, get the optional backseat AC. The Voyager has the ability to cool its interior quite quickly in my view, but while children won't always miss it, adults riding in the back may.
I think every parent who has more than i child should own one of these. Not only is it a God-send just with its ability to be able to hold so much,everyone gets their own *space* and our &quot;Stop touching me!&quot; has been cut down to practically nil! <br><br>
