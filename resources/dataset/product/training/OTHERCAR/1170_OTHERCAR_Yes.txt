            For a stay at home army wife, and soon to be new mom, my husband and I decided that it was time for a family car. As soon as I saw the neon, I was in love. The 2000 neon now sports a very trendy spoiler, even with a 4 door. Not only is the front AND the back seat roomy, but the trunk has incredible space too! After checking out all of the features in the car, it was time for the test drive. This car has plenty pick up and go to it, it swirves around the tiniest of corners while maintaining it's quietness. I loved everything about this car, from its quality tires to the built in Kleenex holder. I would recommend this car for anyone who doesn't have too large of a family, I know I will be keeping this car around for a long, long, time!<br><br>
