            <i>&quot;Oh my God, this car is sooooo you.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;It's you. The car is absolutely you.&quot;

&quot;It's a car.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. But, all those other cars you drove�. They weren't you. This one is.&quot;</i>


Believe it or not, I had this conversation more than once.  In fact, when I introduced my new 1997 Jetta GL to my friends they all had the same reaction.  It was &quot;<i>me</i>&quot;. I wasn't sure how to take this. I was flesh and blood. The Jetta was steel and 10W40-something. But, so many people made this comment I had to give the matter some consideration.   

<i>I tried to solve this mathematically.</i> Sara equals human. Jetta equals car. Car does not equal human. Therefore, if Sara is not a car then Sara is not a Jetta.  Then I remembered my old math grades. How else could I address this issue?

<i>I turned to philosophy.</i>  Am I a woman or am I a car? Perhaps I am a woman dreaming of being a car. Perhaps I am a car dreaming of being a woman dreaming of being a car. Perhaps I need a drink.

<i>Ah, science.</i> I would have to observe the subjects and analyze the data. Here are my field notes:

<b>Exterior

Jetta</b>	
� Overall appearance, not bad. Not the flashiest model out there, but there are some guys who wouldn't mind taking it for a spin.
� Compact size squeezes nicely into the tightest parking spots.
� Window tinted just enough to cut glare and enhance the Jetta's appearance.
� Nice finish. Paint has completely resisted fading for 3 years.
� Deceptive rear end hides a trunk which is amazingly cavernous for a vehicle of its size.

<b>Sara</b>	
� Overall appearance, not bad. Not the flashiest model out there, but there are some guys who wouldn't mind taking it for a spin.
� Not all that compact. Has trouble fitting into a tight pair of jeans.
� Blue eyes have a great deal of trouble handling glare but do enhance Sara's appearance.
� Nice paint job. Needs touch-up every 6 weeks.
� Rear end is prominent. Difficult to hide.


<b>Interior

Jetta</b>
� Nice use of space. Ample head and shoulder room. Good amount of leg room in front. Limited leg room in back. 
� Plush velour seats provide back support but do begin to get uncomfortable on a long ride.
� Cup holders are poorly placed directly under the dash. Will not hold anything taller or wider than a can of soda.
� Glove compartment too small to store anything besides the owner's manual in its deluxe faux leather cover. Side door and console storage compartments do alleviate some of this problem.
� Dashboard is well designed. Environmental and stereo controls are easy for both driver and passenger to access. Instrument panel is easy to read. Air conditioning and heat work amazingly well for a small vehicle.

<b>Sara</b>	
� Has been accused of taking up space. Head too crowded with ideas for new epinions, very little room for anything else. Shoulders roomy enough for a friend. Leg room equal in front and back.
� Plush seat gets sore during a long ride.
� Can easily hold any size coffee or soda cup. Has some difficulty doing this while downshifting, but has turned this into an art form.
� Can hold a pen behind her ear, but little else. Have yet to find a use for saddlebags which have recently been acquired.
� Totally resistant to being controlled. Very difficult to read. Has been known to run hot and cold.


<b>Performance

Jetta</b>
� Incredibly zippy in spite of its modest 4 cylinder, 2.0 Liter, 115 horsepower engine. 5-speed transmission cruises comfortably at 2200 rpm. Manual transmission allows for swift acceleration.
� Stiff suspension hugs the road without impacting driver and passenger comfort. Highly responsive steering.

<b>Sara	</b>
� Engine in need of tune-up.  Redlines at 145 beats per minute. Coffee and chocolate enable swift acceleration.
� Comforted by hugs.
	

<b>Reliability

Jetta</b>
� Starts immediately in all weather conditions.
� 2 year bumper-to-bumper warranty. 10 year powertrain warranty.
� Brakes wore out after 28,000 miles (Heavy city traffic).
� Ignition switch broke after 30,000 miles.
� No other mechanical problems to date.

<b>Sara</b>	
� Needs 2 cups of coffee to get started.
� Well past warranty period.
� Wears out often (especially in heavy city traffic).
� Would rather fight than switch.
� Frequent mechanical problems.


Having analyzed the data, I still have difficulty concluding that the car is, in fact, me. However, I must concede that I have never enjoyed driving/owning a car more. Perhaps it is this joy that my friends have noticed. And, I must admit� If I have to be compared to a car, I could do a lot worse. 

Excuse me, it's time to check my oil.
