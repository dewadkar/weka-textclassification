            I have a 2001 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab SLT.  I enjoy my truck, especially the gutsy 4.7 V8.  (Would take most cars off the line, if I wanted to.)  Cab is comfortable and functional.  Drivers side seat is slightly narrower than I would like, but it's easy to get used to.  Rear legroom is great.  Only other comparable mid-size vehicle with equal or greater legroom is the Ford Sport-Trac.  Mileage is 18-22 on the highway and 14-15 in town.  Not the best, but tolerable for a V8.  The 4.7 magnum is a smooth engine and quite powerful, for the vehicle size.  Bed room has been more than ample for family vacations, trips to Lowe's etc...Trip computer is nice, no CD player (in mine, but is an option)  Very aesthetically pleasing truck, nice lines.  Visibility not the greatest, mine came with deep tinted windows.  Looks good, but I don't recommend it.

Note: I was involved in an accident one month after I got this truck.  A BMW turned left directly in front of me and I t-boned it.  BMW was turned into a horseshoe.  The BMW driver was injured but not seriously, thankfully.  My 3 year old son was with me in the truck.  He was in a booster seat and was just fine as was I. (He was mostly upset because his toys went on the floor!)  The truck suffered about $4000 worth of damage to the front end.
