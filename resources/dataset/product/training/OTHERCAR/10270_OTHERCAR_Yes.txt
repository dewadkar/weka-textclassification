            My wife and I have owned a Nissan Sentra since we moved out to LI from Manhattan back in '93. We leased our first one then and got a new lease on a '97 model three years later, which we currently have. We were able to park it on the streets for the two weeks before we moved into our apartment on LI , into the tightest spaces you could possibly imagine...maybe a quarter-of-an-inch of room on each bumper. 

The room is adequate for quick trips into the City, and taking to the station. For a family of three, we need a little more safety and room for trips and weekends away, so it does have it's drawbacks. But, as a necessary second family car, it pays for itself in gas savings and has been reliable for the past 3 years.

It handles very well in any weather, is pretty powerful for a four-cylinder, and definitely has it's advantages weaving through crowded streets at high speeds when necessary. I also sometimes feel it's size makes you very vulnerable, as your very low to the ground.  <br><br>
