            I bought my '93 Mazda 626 ES used in 1995.  It was a late '93, so it was only about 1 1/2 years old with 25,000 miles.  Unfortunately, it is an automatic -- I didn't get to have the fun of the manual.  It holds the road really well around corners, partially due to its low-profile, wide tires.

Shortly after I bought it, I realized the tires needed to be replaced.  I went to Goodyear and they mentioned the two words you don't want to hear when buying tires: &quot;performance tires&quot;.  Only two models come in this size: GT+II and GT+4.  These are not good snow tires, they are good racing tires :-).  They come with no treadlife warranty, and the tread really peels off of it in normal driving.  I have gotten about 25,000 miles out of these tires (I bought the GT+II's) before they have needed to be replaced.  

The engine (2.5L V6) is quite fuel efficient and really has excellent acceleration.  I get 20 mpg in normal around-town/freeway driving.  Even 6 years old, it takes off like a new car.  

The interior comforts are pretty good: I have the cloth seats, but the seats are more like racing seats -- they have plenty of lateral support, are still stiff after 6 years, and the backseat has a fold-down armrest.  The front doesn't have an armrest and the cupholders are small.  The tires cause an above average amount of road noise, but the V6 is dead quiet.

I have had a few repairs: the exhaust system fell apart not too much after I bought it (then needed a new tube and resonator -- $$), then I got a hole in the muffler, so over a few years I replaced the entire exhaust system.  The Bridgestone tires that came with it originally only lasted 2 years.  Other than that, it has been very reliable and economical, while being incredibly fun to drive.
I haven't had any of the transmission problems that have been reported often about this car.

I definately could see how one could rack up some speeding tickets in this car.  I have had it up to about 105 mph on the interstate in Illinois (luckily those tires are T rated - 112 mph I believe).  <br><br>
