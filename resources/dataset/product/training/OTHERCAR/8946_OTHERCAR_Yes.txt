            We got our Trooper S in late 1994 because we needed something heavy duty enough to lug furniture, garden supplies, lumber, kayaks etc, but presentable enough to put the wife's family in for a Sunday brunch outing.  After a TON of homework evaluating other SUV's and similar vehicles, we found the Isuzu and fell in love.  They did it right!  Enough headroom, enough power, enough comfort, enough traction, big enough, handsome enough.  No $40,000 yuppie extravagances that bump your head and ride like a circus trailer, like the Range Rovers; no cheesy &quot;fake truck body on a plain old car chassis&quot; like the Explorer.  From the moment I opened the solid door and stepped *UP* into the comfy seat, I was hooked.

In the years since, our Trooper has carried kids, dogs, flowerpots, full length railroad ties, bikes, tables, dressers, crushed stone, quail eggs, visiting celebrities, telescopes, and manure.  It has run through road floods that sidelined most other traffic, through blizzard buried highways lined with fishtailed sedans on both sides, and through fancy restaurant driveways with valet parking attendants who tell us &quot;awesome car man&quot; when we pick it up.  It has pulled boats, trailers, wagons, stumps, and rocks.  It has rescued cars from ditches, PICKUP TRUCKS from ditches, and a small earth mover from a 6 foot mudhole.  It has led the wedding procession.

Can it tip over on too steep a sideways slope or an extremely fast and sharp turn?  I imagine so.  It's a tall vehicle, and once or twice in the time I've owned it, I've felt that high center of gravity.  You need to drive ANY sport utility vehicle carefully!  Four wheel drive is not a license to drive recklessly - a point every car manufacturer makes, and many drivers ignore anyway.  But the Trooper rewards good driving with excellent maneuverability and stability.

After five years, I did finally get rid of the factory stereo - it was either that or trade in for a 2000 Trooper, and a new sound system was much cheaper.  I also adapted my existing Thule roof rack rather than get the factory rack - no sense wasting it, and the Thule is much more versatile.

I also replaced the windshield after five years, because with all the hard road use it had taken enough stones to start a couple of cracks I didn't like.

The day does not go by that I don't glance out my window at the theft-bait Grand Cherokees and white-elephant Discoveries alongside on the highway, and thank my stars I found the Trooper<br><br>
