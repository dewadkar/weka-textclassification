            AUGUST 19th, 2002 UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Forget the negative stuff that you've heard about Cadillacs. Computer problems, Cadillacs are for 'old people,' etc. At least the people who've propagated that stuff weren't talking about Seville STS's. If they were, they're completely wrong! The 1990 STS is a great, midsize luxury performance sedan. In fact, it's rare. There were limited productions of them. Out of the 1986-1991 Seville generation, the 1991 STS is the best, performance-wise, but marginally. The 1990 STS is my second choice. (1988 & 1989 exterior wise, looks like a base Seville with an STS interior...don't touch these years) The 1990 is probably a better decision than the 1991. The reason being is that the 1991 uses the dreaded CCR struts (electronic front & rear struts) that costs about $400.00 for front and $600.00 for the rear, plus, you can only purchase them through a high-priced Cadillac dealership. They go out at about 100-130k miles. Ouch!!!!!!!! Even though you can use 1990 regular struts on a 1991 (most people don't know this), most places like Sears, Kragens, Pep Boys, Auto Zone, etc. will probably refer you to a Cadillac dealership as when they punch 1991 Cadillac into their computer data base, no part number will come up. Plus 1991 STSs are hard to find in excellent condition. Most of them are in the junk yard due to the fact that when the CCR struts go out, the owners opt to get rid of their car as CCR struts cost over 1k at a Cadillac dealership + they're ignorant to the facts that they can use regular struts on their 1991, the CCR system can be disabled (so 'Service CCR System' will never show up again on their Driver Information  Center after installation of regular struts), and CCR struts are no longer being made. Cadillac dealers are just trying to liquidate their overstock of high-priced, low performance CCR struts on 1991 Cadillac owners instead of spreading the good news that we can use regular struts. Back to the 1990 STS: It doesn't have FACTORY REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY, lateral support front seats, 200 horsepower 4.9L engine, electronic tranny, etc., but it's still a great car. As with the 1991 STS, the 1990 comes in only six exterior colors (WHITE DIAMOND, POLO GREEN, ROYAL MAROON, CARMINE RED, BLACK SAPPHIRE, AND SABLE BLACK) and one interior color (MEDIUM BEECHWOOD LEATHER). If your 1990 or 1991 STS didn't come in one of the aforementioned colors, it has been repainted! You may view the aforementioned colors on my webpage:

The 1990 and 1991 STS paint includes a premium clearcoat that gives even a common black color (SABLE BLACK) depth...glossy...that wet look only found on those expensive new cars. Yes, it's on a twelve year old American luxury car too. The 1990 and 1991 are head turners because of their excellent appearance, plus you don't see them everywhere. If buying a 1990 (or 1991 for that matter), inspect everything (exhaust, electronic level control system, lock key cylinder, struts...especially for the 1991. Common problems on both years: If your dash lights or interior lights dim every time you lock, unlock the doors, open the fuel filler door or trunk release from the glove compartment, there is definitely something wrong with your electrical system (alternator) and you should service your car right away. If your brakes overheat, there is something wrong with your front or rear suspension bushings (they may be worn) or your calipers may need new pistons (they may be sticking) or rebuilt calipers, struts are bouncy in front and rear bottoms (it may be time for new ones + rear struts may be out of air due to being worn, your elc system may be exhausting the air...major leak or you may have to replace your elc motor/relay/etc.), excessive engine movement (mounts may be worn), windows roll up and down slowly (window motors are getting ready to go out), etc. Also, very important: If you're thinking about buying a 1990 or 1991 STS, take the vehicle out for a test drive. Do not only check and see if a brake light comes up or stays on the dash or if a message comes up in the driver information center. Check for stored and new diagnostic codes on the 'Driver Information Center.' How to enter diagnostics mode: Press and hold down the 'off' and 'warmer' buttons simultaneously on the electronic climate control area. It will then enter diagnostics mode, even if you're driving. NEW & HISTORY codes will be displayed. Some can be something as harmless as the 'trip odometer' has been reset, whereas others can be something as huge as A/C compressor needs replacement, odometer has been tampered with or that your car has been in an accident, etc. NOTE: If your airbag has ever deployed (indicating the car has been in an accident or if the odometer has been tampered with, a permanent code will set for either scenario and there is no way to remove it. That's why it's a smart idea to purchase the official 1990 (or 1991 if you buy a 1991) 'Service Information Manual' for the Eldorado and Seville. The books are Cadillac-GM officials and are made to assist Cadillac dealership mechanics and other mechanics in servicing your STS. The 1990 book color is reddish and the 1991 book color is dark greenish. It's thicker than an encyclopedia and contains everything that you will ever need to know about your STS (unlike the non-informative owner's manuals). The books retails new for about $99.95, but can be found on eBay under 'Eldorado/Seville Service Information Manual' for up to $50.00. Overall, a great car. AFFORDABLE LUXURY. They costs up to 8k, but I wouldn't pay more than 7k for it unless the miles are below 30k. Don't buy a 1990 or 1991 STS over 120k miles (or any other mileage for that matter) without first educating yourself about the car, accessories, etc., and giving it a thorough inspection!!!!!!!!!! I don't care if the tranny was 'rebuilt' or the engine is 'new.' Chances are that the suspension components, motor/tranny mounts, power steering pump, wheel bearings, control arm bushings, stabilizer link insulators, disc rotors, calipers, master cylinder, brake lines, radiator, all gaskets, struts are worn out, wheels are leaking air, exhaust system is leaking, major tune-ups and schedule maintenance are due, etc. The aforementioned problems will cost at least 7.5k-8k at the cheapest auto shop you can find to repair. Don't get stuck with a lemon! There is more to a car than a just a motor and tranny.
