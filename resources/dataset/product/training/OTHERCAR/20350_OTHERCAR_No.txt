            A couple of years ago I made a terrible buying decision and bought a 91 Pontiac Sunbird.  Over the past two years I've spent around $1,500 fixing up a car that cost me alittle over $3000.  Keep in mind that that $1,500 is including the discounts I get for having my best friend's uncle fix my car(he has his own business).  Unlike other reviews I've read, my 91 sunbird did not have a V6 engine, I've never seen one.  My car had a four cylinder piece of crap.  When I brought it in to get fixed after a short trip, I was told that with the Pontiac's engine you can not drive at high speeds 75-80 mph.  Well I drove 65-75 for 2 and a half hours straight and I blew a head gasket that ended up costing me $400 to fix.  A couple other people I know have had the same problem happen to them.  
However, I must admit that the car does get good mileage and it will get you to where you want to go.  The car handles nicely but it lacks in power, even running the air conditioning sucks some of its power away.  If I had my choice again, I would have rather spent an extra thousand to get a better car.  <br><br>
