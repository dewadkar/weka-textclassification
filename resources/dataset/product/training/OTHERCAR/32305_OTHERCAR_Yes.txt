            My husband bought this car brand new for a great price in Sep. '99.

Since then, it has taken us up and down the East Coast, from North to South. We put an average of 45 miles daily on the car just for comute. And That is not including all the other times that we are on the road!

I think that this car is definately cost-efficiant and well worth what we paid. We get wonderful gas mileage and even with all the miles that we've put on the car, we have NOT had ANY maintenance problems in the 1 1/2 yrs we've had it.

For a compact car, we have been able to fit pretty much all that we've needed to in it. It has a definate advantage, because the back seats fold in from the trunk to allow more trunk room. The best part about that is that it folds only 2/3 of the back seat down, and my daughters car-seat fits exactly in whats left. That way we don't have to compramise too much.

I am very happy that we chose to buy this car out of all that we looked at.
