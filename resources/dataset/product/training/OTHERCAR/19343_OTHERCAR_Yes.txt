            I purchased my 2001 Infiniti I30t in October of 2000. I still do not regret it. I now have 35000 miles on it and the car still feels solid.

I was very impressed by the 3.0L 'VQ' V6 engine. The engine is very quiet and smooth at any speed. When you need to punch it to pass someone or accelerate on an onramp, it is not a problem in this car. Power delivery is ample all the way up to redline, even with 3 passengers.

The car's suspension is also a huge pro on this car. Although it weighs close to 3400lbs, you'd never guess it. The car handles far better than any other FWD car of that size I've ever driven. The limited-slip differential (LSD) makes all the difference in holding the car to the road on any turn. There is no understeer or oversteer -- the car simply goes where you point it. Many cars with sporty suspension offer jarring rides over uneven surfaces. The I30t is NOT like that at all! The roads of Chicago are awful and I drive them every day. The I30t's suspension absorbs all but the largest potholes. The suspension provides a smooth ride on those long highway trips as well.

Although Infinitis are usually very stylish, I think the I30 just doesn't fit in. The car looks classy and refined but I still do not like the headlamps. They look borrowed from another car and are unattractive. The rest of the car is definitely a well-styled work of art. Automotive styling is subjective, but I still think that after 3 years the car looks good.

What also impressed me (and still does) about the I30 is the exceptional fit and finish of the interior. Like I said above, the car has 35000 miles and sees use daily. The interior still feels like new. The leather seats are still soft and supportive. There has not been a single squeaky seat or interior panel. My only gripe is that the faux wood trim gets covered in fingerprints easily.

Infinitis are always known for their exceptional reliability, and the I30 is no exception. Not a single thing has broken on the car in 3 years. Nothing squeaks, rattles, or vibrates. The car feels just as solid as when I drove it home with 7 miles on it.

Although the I30 is mechanically similar to the Maxima, it certainly is not just a Maxima with some extras thrown in. The Nissan Maxima is a sports sedan that gives some trade-offs in the noise and ride department. The I30 offers everything the Maxima does but does it quietly and withless bumps and jarrs. Spend the few extra thousand on the I30 and reap the benefits (like the longer warranty).
