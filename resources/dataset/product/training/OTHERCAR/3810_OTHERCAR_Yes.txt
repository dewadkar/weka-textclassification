            Utilizing the same uni-body system that only the Rav4 has, the Honda CR-V has managed to become a much more car-like SUV.  This sounds like something that isn't a good, thing, but it most definitely is...

<b>Appearance/Asthetics</b>

This is the most plain vehicle that you are going to be able to buy in the SUV market...  It doesn't have anything that sticks out.  The color is solid...  It just doesn't have a whole lot of curves... it's a very simple vehicle and that's what is making the CR-V so popular... they are keeping to simplicity and giving it more functionality.

The only real thing that stands out is the interior, which stands out for the wrong reasons...  The interior is extremely tacky, with designer seat covers which look more like a throw blanket than they look like seat covers...  I picture them coming straight out of a Mexican seemstresses abode..  

There's nothing that really looks impressive anywhere in the vehicle as far as asthetics go..


<b>Features</b>

This thing has a really cool seat feature that I like.  In the rear seats, you are able to adjust the seats to whatever position that you like for comfort.  So, they definitely made refinements in the seating area.  The seats are also extremely comfortable in general.  Also, there are integrated cupholders in the armrest in the backseat...  woohoo!  ;)

Another cool thing, is that they brought back the flip up center tray console thing...  That is a very very sweet feature and I think that every single car ever produced should feature something of that nature...  However, it definitely is sort of ugly, so it needs to have some trim or something fancy...

The car also features white and black gauges, which is pretty cool, but not really cool enough.

<b>Overall</b>

Probably the most reasonably priced SUV on the market.  While it doesn't feature much of anything in aesthetics and the seats are extremely ugly, this SUV definitely performs like it was meant to.  With increased horsepower to 160, from the previous 146, the vehicle is definitely a much more powerful SUV, however it is still lacking the necessary power for extreme loads.

The comfort of the CR-V is extremely good, but I just couldn't seem to get all that comfortable with so much legroom and such a simple vehicle...  

But, if you like simplicity and a vehicle that simple just does... this is the right one for you...
