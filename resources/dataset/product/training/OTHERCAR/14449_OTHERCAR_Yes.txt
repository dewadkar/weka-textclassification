            We have a Toyota Camry V6 and I absolutely adore this car.  It's very practical, yet luxurious.  We chose the single disk CD player, leather interior, and a sunroof.  It came with the option of having two power front seats, but we just have one for the driver.  When we bought it in 1995, and we got a great deal on it too.
  
This car has great pick-up, and almost feels like you are on a cloud or even flying.  It also has a great turning ratio and great handling. Also, for all those family trips it's got a fair amount of room in the trunk and the back seat fold down to create even more storage space.  Furthermore, it has good aerodynamics, so when you're on a lonesome road it takes high speeds with ease.  It also has good gas mileage.  I believe it is 26 on the streets and 31 on highway.  

My parents specifically bought this car so that I would have a safe car to learn how to drive in.  It has driver and passenger airbags for that extra bit of safety, and 5 person seating capacity.  I know this car will hold up n an accident because I am a statistic, that in one year of receiving my license I was in a really bad T-Bone collision and it held up well, and kept myself and my friend safe.  After some fixing up, it runs like the accident never occurred.
Five years later I'm glad they bought it for me and I know it has plenty of life in it.  Toyota's last forever.  Our last Toyota lasted us 13 years. 

The only flaw in this car, which is partially my own fault, is getting it in dark green. The green is bad because it shows a lot of dirt, but other than that it's a perfect car.
