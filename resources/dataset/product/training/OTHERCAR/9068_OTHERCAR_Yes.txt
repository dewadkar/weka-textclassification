            I had been watching the Kia for several years.  My van was starting to have problems and I decided Kia had been around long enough to put my money where my mouth was.  I have loved the Kia since the first time I saw one about 5 years ago.

I have the convertible, and in Arizona and Nv. it was greaat summer or winter to have the top off.  The A/C is powerful and the heater is fast.  It reminds me of my very first car. That was an Austin Healy Sprite.
There are a few things I don't like, not major, just a llittle annoying.  No place to have misc. items in front compartment.  Such as a tray for those nasty cigarettes.  I have back and inability to lift my leg up to get into regular cars and with my Kia it is perfect to slide into.  

I have had a few problems with my car, battery must have water added to it (it's old fashion)  Kia did replace it, only had 5000 miles on it, It is going into the shop on Tuesday for a leaking differential and the recall on the front (4wheel dr) joint or something, and the fuel injectors recall.  I thought I was getting sloppy at driving, as it would stall while starting out  either forward or backward and would speed up (to much gas in 1st gear.

This car is a dream to drive.  I can make &quot;U&quot; turns on a dime.  Makes getting into parking spaces easy.  I am 58 years old and feel like 18 when I get behind the wheel.  My Grandkids love it when I pick them up at school and my own kids think I'm nuts.  If the American car makers could make as rugged a car of this their car sales would go up.  I have been staying in California for the winter and to live here I would recommend the regular Sportage (4dr)).  I even have a lumbar seat, 3 air bags what more can you want in an inexpensive car?  If I were to buy another car today it would be a Kia.

I would not advise this car for someone that lives in a real windy area, aas it does bounce around in the wind, but I think I feel it more due to the removable top.<br><br>
