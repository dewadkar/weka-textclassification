            I bought a 93 Sentra with a few too many miles on it because it was the only car I could afford, and my wife needed a car for work the next week.  I saw the Sentra and, at first, it reminded me of my 89 Corolla.  The body style and interior layout are almost identical.  It had some features I liked, automatic seatbelt and airbags mainly, and it was new enough that I wasn't going to get raped on emissions testing every year.

Now, good things about this car, it's fairly comfortable, even on long trips.  Great gas mileage as long as I keep the oil changed.  It will run forever if I maintain it.  In the two years I've owned it, I haven't had a single major problem.  Also, all the value is gone, so I can keep piling the miles on it without hurting resale.  

The cons, no power.  In Atlanta traffic, I have to be able to zip through traffic in a car this small.  I can't do that as well with this thing as with my Mustang.  Also, even if it's a Nissan, it's old.  Now, if I want to, I'll get another 60k miles out of it, but then it starts to cost more than it's worth.  Also, I bought it used and I don't think the previous owner took care of it at all.  As old as this car is, you can bet you will be at least the third owner.

If you're in desperate need of a car and this is what you can afford, then buy it and drive it for a couple of years until you get something else.  Also, make sure of the history of the car.  Carfax.com is pretty good for that.  Definitely take it to someone and pay $100 to have him look at it before you buy.

If you're not desperate or can afford more, then  you shouldn't even be looking at this car.  <br><br>
