            I have had three Olympus digital cameras since I began my digital photo experience.  Each camera has been an upgrade over the previous.  I had a 450 Zoom Olympus before I bought the 3000Z and I have been pleased with the performance of all three cameras. 
The reason for my latest upgrade was for better quality pictures which I print at home on a HW 1100 Photo Printer.  The 3000Z gives me the quality 
I was looking for.
The camera is small, portable, light and very easy to operate. It does not consume as much battery as my previous Olympus. Downloading to the computer is a cinch.
I don't like the lens cap.  It falls off easily.  It is not up to par with the camera.  Also, the camera is sold with a 8mb card which is definitely deficient.  You need at least 32 mb, preferably 64 mb.
This camera is not for every one, mainly because of the price but if you are looking for quality prints, easy handling and are convinced that digital photography is the way to go, then this is the camera for you
