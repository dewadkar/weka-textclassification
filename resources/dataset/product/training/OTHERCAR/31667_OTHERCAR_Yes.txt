            We bought a 1996 Chevy Mark III Conversion Van that drives like a car. We have owned two other Conversions Vans in the past. The previous two were three quarter ton vehicles with the larger engines. This one has the smaller v-8, but is a half ton vehicle. The other two had lots of power but rode a little rough. This van we have now has the smoothest ride even in the back and also there's something about the way the front seat is situated that makes it feel as though you're driving a really nice luxury car instead of a full size conversion van.

What does this have to do with a 65mph impact? Good question! We were making a trip to Clovis, NM late on night. We had just rounded a curve through a small town named Broadview and the speed limit sign said 65mph.

 My hubby got it up to 65 and set the cruise control and sped away into the night.It was an extremely dark night and he used his brights when he could. Our granddaughter was sitting in the passenger seat, slumped down and just about asleep when she made the comment to him, &quot;Papa don't hit anything&quot;.

Just a few minutes later, they both saw it at the same time, but it was too late. There was a black cow on the highway and we had no time to avoid it. He didn't even have time to hit the brakes. Our granddaughter screamed, we felt the impact and it blew the airbags. We continued down the highway and there was smoke coming from the front of the dash. There was a momentary flash of light at the impact, but immediately became dark inside the van. 

My husband tried to stop the van but the brakes did not respond. The van finally came to a stop on its own about three tenths of a mile from the point of impact. Our granddaughter Jamie had burns on her legs from the airbag and a sore jaw. My husband had a minor injury to his wrist. I was sitting in the back of the van and was unhurt.  

I did not see the cow from where I sat. I only knew immediately on impact my husband started telling our granddaughter to &quot;Get out. Unbuckle and get out&quot;. Hey, we were still traveling down the road. With the pitch dark he could not tell that we were still moving. 

His objective was to get us out of there in case it blew up. Fortunately she did not get out before the vehicle had stopped. She was in a lot of pain from the burns on her legs. I was unbuckling and trying to find the cell phone. I thought the motor had exploded because of all the smoke in the van. I kept asking, &quot;what happened&quot; as we all piled out of the van. Finally after we were all outside I was informed that we hit a cow.

The state trooper said that the cow rolled up into the motor and wiped out the brake system, the steering system and the head lights. The reason we traveled so far after impact was because we carried the animal for about a tenth of a mile before it rolled off the front of the vehicle and somehow rolled out of our way into the opposite ditch. 

We traveled the additional two tenths of a mile without brakes, steering, and lights and eventually came to a stop safely on the shoulder on our side of the road. I attribute our survival to God first of all, then to a very well designed van that sits low to the road that allowed the animal to land in the motor instead of rolling under the vehicle or over the hood into the windshield. And to the fact that we were all wearing our seatbelts.

 We are still driving the van and it gets great gas mileage and is still a wonderful vehicle to drive. Oh, by the way. The van sustained $14,000.00 worth of damage, but the insurance took care of that.
