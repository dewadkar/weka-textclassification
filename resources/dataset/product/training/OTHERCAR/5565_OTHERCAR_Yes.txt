            The Lexus RX 300 is a sound investment that will comfort and protect your family.  The first thing that you notice when you enter the vehicle is the roominess of it.  Kids have ample room in the back seat (especially because there is no transmission hump there).  The seats and interior are genuine leather and extremely comfortable.  The front seats have their own arm rests and seat warmers (which are very handy on those cold winter days).   Even more handy in the snow are the four-wheel drive and full-sized spare tire.
What really sets this vehicle apart are the small details.  The RX 300 is equipped with a special garage door-opener in the front visor.  A small remote control is embedded into the visor that actually learns the frequency of you current garage door opener thus eliminating the need for those cumbersome objects.  There are several cupholders for both the front and back seats.  The sound system is unbelievable.  From time to time I hop in the car to listen to a CD, even when I'm not going anywhere!
The ride is everything that you would expect from Lexus: extremely smooth and quieter than a grave.  What really sold me on the vehicle, however, was my mother.  She was involved in a minor accident in a parking lot.  Another car hit plowed into her on the driver's side.  My mother reported though that &quot;she did not feel a thing&quot; because it is so sturdy.  The RX 300 is great for safety, practicality and luxury.<br><br>
