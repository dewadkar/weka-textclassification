            I was interested in finding a digital camera that would offer excellent image quality combined with the ability to control the picture-taking process. I was looking for quality and value.

In the end, to cut through the process, I bought the Minolta S414. The aluminum body felt sturdy and the camera felt good in my hands. It has a 4 MP imaging array, a 4x optical zoom (features commonly found on more expensive cameras). And it gives the user substantial control over the creation of the picture. The pictures that I'd seen were absolutely razor sharp.

The Minolta zoom lens is marginally slower than those found on more expensive cameras (3.0 as opposed to 2.4 or 2.80)but it delivers on image quality.

The S414 is essentially an upgrade to the S404.  The only complaints that I've seen regarding the S414 are that the lens cap is cheap (it is) and that the tri-pod mount is inconvenient (it probably is, but...) Also noted is that the camera eats alkaline batteries. Digital cameras do this. Get rechargeables.

In short, I'm really happy with this camera. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. The pictures, which is what this is about, have been clear and sharp. There are more bells and whistles than I have the time to summarize (a mixed-blessing of digital cameras).At the same time, the menus are logical and the camera can function in a variety of modes ranging from wholly automatic to manual. The learning curve steepens as more options are brought into play. Such is the price of flexibility.

I would recommend that anyone buying a digital camera should go out and do some hands-on shopping. How a camera feels in your hands is important. Pick up an S414. The quality is (but for the lens cap)immediately apparent. Feature for feature, the value is there. Look at the pictures that can be found on-line. Read the reviews.
(see dpreview.com or search google)

Whether this camera fits in your hand is up to you. It deserves, based on my experience, at least a look.
