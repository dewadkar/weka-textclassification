            My girlfriend needs a car to replace her aging Mercury Tracer and we had the opportunity to look at several mid-size cars in the $20-25K range this past weekend. We checked out the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Pontiac Grand Prix and Grand Am, Chrysler Cirrus, and the Chevrolet Impala. Of all of these, the Chevrolet Impala came out on top.

In my opinion, this car is not a true Impala compared to the late lamented 1994-96 Impala SS or the legendary Impalas of the 1960s. What this car is, however, is a quantum leap over the dull Lumina. The Lumina was as vanilla a car as vanilla can get. The Toyota Camry is a Ferrari Testarossa compared to a Lumina. The Lumina makes the perfect fleet/government/rental car but a truly boring personal car. 

The Impala has vastly more personality and far more interesting styling. There's no mistaking it for anything else. Personally, I think Chevrolet should have kept the awesome Caprice/Impala. Maybe they should've named this car the Bel Air or Biscayne since it only has four taillights when a true Impala has six.

From about $18K for a base model to $24K for a loaded Impala LS, you get a lot of car for a little bit of money. For a comparable amount of money it didn't seem you got as much with the other cars. The Honda seemed rather plain inside, the Cirrus was smaller and not very comfortable, the Camry was too expensive - most around $28K, and the Pontiacs didn't seem too much different than the Impala. The Impala also offers much more distinctive styling although I thought the spoiler on the LS model we tested was a little silly on a car like this.

The car we test drove was the sporty LS. I have a 1994 Cadillac Deville and the Impala, despite being a smaller car, rode as smooth as my Caddy. The quiet 3.8 liter V-6 has a lot of get up and go and the seats were extremely comfortable. The engine bay area is well laid out and uncluttered. Rear seating is cavernous. The factory stereo was clear and crisp and the A/C rapidly cooled the car. Other things I liked were the rear seats that folded down to access/expand the trunk area and the shoulder lap belt for the center rear passenger. The Impala also offers an outlet for a rear cell phone. I've also seen that the ignition switch has moved from the steering column to the dash panel in an effort to thwart thieves. GM cars of the past have been notoriously easy to steal by smashing the hard plastic collar on the steering column and then activating the exposed ignition component with a screwdriver.

The Impala is available with two V-6s: a 3.4 liter @ 180hp and a 3.8 liter @ 200. I'd go for the 3.8. I haven't heard much good about the smaller engine, but only good things about the 3.8. I'd also opt for the upgraded 16&quot; aluminum wheels over the base steel wheels with their tacky plastic covers.

I liked the styling of the dashboard, but the quality of the materials on it and the door panels was a little too plasticky for my tastes. The style of the fabric used in the base model was a bit grotesque - looks like some little kid drew all over it with crayons. I've seen this goofy pattern in both foreign and domestic cars. I would opt for the upgraded cloth interior or leather. 

All in all our experience with the Impala was a pleasant one. The salesman was very accommodating and at no point did we feel pressured. I would recommend that anybody who is in the market for a new mid-size car to seriously consider the Impala.<br><br>
