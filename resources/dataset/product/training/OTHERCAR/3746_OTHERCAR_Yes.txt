            Driving the Chevy Silverado 1500 is truly an experience.  My friend has one and he let me take it off-road.  This truck is incredible.  The 5.3l V8 engine along with the switch on the fly 4WD gives the Silverado the ability to perform in any terrain.  But, not only is the performance top-notch, the Chevy Silverado looks fantastic too.  My friend happens to own the Z-71 edition.  This thing turns heads on the road.  The torque and towing capacity of this pick-up is phenomenal.  When pulling a boat, it feels as if there isn't even a trailer behind the truck.  There is plenty of room in the back seat, allowing the Silverado to tend to the needs of a family.  If you're in the market for a full size pick-up, check out the Chevy Silverado 1500.  It surely is &quot;like a rock.&quot;<br><br>
