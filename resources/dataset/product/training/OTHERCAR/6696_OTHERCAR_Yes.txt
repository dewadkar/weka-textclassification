            I bought my 1996 black Z3 a few weeks ago. It has power heated seats, windows,air,cruise and factory alarm. 96 cars came standard with the 1.9 ltr engine.

Background:
I gave up my Harley as a toy as it was too dangerous. Once you have kids everything changes, you grow up I guess. My wife and I wanted something to fill the gap the bike left us with. We have owned boats, but weather dictates when and if you can use them. We decided on a convertible sports car.

Search:
I looked at Boxters, Miatas and the Z3's.
Boxters were in the 30's used and offered less room than the Z. I am 6'2 280 and space was a concern. I have a bad disk in my back also, comfort was key.
The Miata was just too small, it does not have the curb appeal of the other 2 either. They were the cheapest used at around 7-10K used.

The Z3's were bringing 20-30k,  The 96 model with the smaller engine was the best deal. I looked at a 97 with a 2.8ltr for 25K, but what was not sold on the need for more power. This car is made to look cool and turn heads, and it does. I dont need a 300hp motor to make me feel better about myself. If i wanted fast, I could have bought a Mustang Gt for half the money. Its not about that and if you don't understand, well you should look elsewhere. This is a roadster, hence the name. The sheer experience of driving a small sports car with the top down, down a winding road will cure you of you high horsepower anxiety.

Dealers:
Buying from a dealer is key.
I found my car at Inskip BMW and was blown away by the service and attention. The car was perfect to begin with, they put 4 brand new tires on it fixed very minor cosmetic issues without me asking. Thats service.
The car has a 3 yr, 36K warranty and has only 32k on it to begin with! If you can buy from a dealer locally, I would recommend it. BMW's are expensive to repair. Keeping the car serviced is key. Dealers want your business and need to keep you happy.

Driving:
The seats offer me great comfort, even with my bad back. The heated seats take away my back pain, the seats were designed by an orthopedic doctor, whick may be part of the reason.
Loads of leg room, not much storage space however.
Handling is like a go cart, flat and quick. Super sticky in the corners. Maybe some cars can beat you in a straight line, not in the corners though. The engine is smooth and predictable, not a powerhouse but pulls nicely and does not bog down on the highway in 5th. The gearbox is like silk and easy to shift. The brakes seem like they should be on a 747! This thing stops on a dime!
Nice civil ride even on bad roads.

I cant begin to tell you how many people look at the car and wave, smile and give the thumbs up to us. Its a cool toy that everyone should try once in a lifetime.

I will add to this review as I have with my other vehicles as the miles add up. This I feel will better inform the reader, and help them make an informed descision.
