            My husband and I bought a 1996 Lincoln Continental in November of 1998.
I love this car!  It is not only luxurious and comfortable to ride in, it's an awesome
driving experience.  Quite, powerful, reliable and ultra sophisticated, this is a 
car for people who deserve luxury, yet can't quite afford it.  This is a dynamite car,
and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to drive.

The downside of this automobile is that it is a little expensive, for a used car.  We paid
$22,000 and financed $415 per month for 5 years.  Not bad for a luxury car, but for a
used car that is steep.

Also, this car is not made for kids!  I have 3 boys and keeping it looking like a finer car is almost 
impossible.  I love my car, and I love my kids, so we have learned to co-exist peaceably.

Our car is a 1996 Lincoln Continental Signature Series, and, the other downfall, insurance
for this vehicle is expensive.  However, over all, I find this car to be well worth the
extra money and the extra &quot;cleanliness&quot; hassle.  Also, it requires premium gasoline, which, in today's
gasoline economy, is very expensive.

If you can afford the gas, and don't mind buying used, this is one fine automobile.<br><br>
