            I bought this car used 19000 miles fall 2000, sold it at 23000 summer 2001. There were ever never any problems, everything worked as supposed. The only thing I disliked was the 17� BBS wheels, they make the car uncomfortable on the bumpy concrete highways.
This car was equipped with a low pressure turbo (LPT), 190HP, good enough for daily use. Thou if you like to race a mustang you have to upgrade to the high pressure turbo (HPT) 236HP. I think the 2,4liter LPT is better than the 2,3liter HPT. It feels like the LPT i stronger at lower rpm.
If you chose between a LPT and HPT it�s better to take the LPT especially if it has more equipment. The Dolby prologic surround stereo with ugly speaker in the dashboard is worth more then the extra power in the HPT.
