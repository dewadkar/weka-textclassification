            We needed a car for now and for the future. Early June, we brought a black C 230 with grey interiors. It has the C2 option(that is the Sun roof, power seat for the front passenger and foldable rear seats.)

What's great and what we love about the car:

-Customizable
It is customizable, the steering wheel can be moved, the 10 way power seats are superb for that extra comfort.

-Engine
The pickup is very nice, it just races. We have the steptronic, but never used the actual gears so far. It is a 185 hp super-charged 4 cylinder engine, but is more zipper than the 6 cylinder 2000 Mustang with an automatic.

-Music system
The standard music system with Radio and Cassette is superb and includes dialing in the station instead of running all through the list, has noise sensitive volume control which is quite accurate and the sound is great.

-Space
The space is ample in the front and the back, the seats are built to sit into, though the seating capacity is more apt for 4 people than 5.

-Trunk
It has a very big trunk and after folding the rear seats, the length increases even more. Even without folding the seats, the trunk can accommodate all the shopping we do.

-Prestige
At the price of a sedan, it attracts more attention than an Acura or a Passat and in terms of exclusivity, in the bay area where we stay these are still less in numbers than BMWs.

-Price
The price is superb for a car like this, though we asked for bids as recommended by fool.com. It cost us $ 31,750 and 34,800 with taxes and licensing fees. Incase you want to read more about the method, it is online at

-Tele-Aid
There is a 1 year free wireless help system. This allows the driver to get help in an emergency, get information like driving directions or car information if it is stalled somewhere. Since they can locate the car without any outside assistance, any signs of an accident including deployed airbags(it has side and front) will automatically get help. This costs $200 per annum after the first year.

-Warranty
Mercedes Benz will cover the car for all repairs for 4 years or 50,000 miles whichever is earlier and has roadside assistance till you own the car.

All, in all it is a great family car and though we have brought for my wife in mind, I plan to drive it often.
