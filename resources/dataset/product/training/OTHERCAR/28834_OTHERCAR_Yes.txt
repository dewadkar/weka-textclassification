            Although I have been an avid photographer for many years, I had only toyed with the idea of entering a whole new world of photography.  Not the most computer literate person, digital photography seemed a bit overwhelming.  My family, however, had different ideas, and presented me with a Kodak 210 digital camera for Christmas.  I can tell you, from a beginner point of view, the camera is wonderful.  Easy to use, compact enough to fit in my purse, making it readily available for those photos I'd often miss.  Carrying my 35mm and zoom lens around was never an option!  The picture-easy software is user friendly, and I was sending photos as attachments within hours of opening my gift.  If you are a beginner with digital photography, the Kodak product is definitely a must-see, must try!  The photo quality is also quite supurb!  It's a whole new dimension in photography!<br><br>
