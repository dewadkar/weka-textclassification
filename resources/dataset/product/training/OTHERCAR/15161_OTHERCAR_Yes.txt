            First of all, you can acquire this camera for 300 new, and 200 refurbished (good as new in my opinion). SmartMedia cards are cheap too.. you can get a 64 meg card for 30 dollars.  And the battery life everyone complains about.. its inherent to the fact it's a digital camera. But spend the money (about 18 dollars for 4) and get NiMH 1500maH batteries. I've gotten more than 60 pictures out of them per charge.. and you can get more depending on flash and LCD screen.  

So yes, the camera goes through batteries, faster than some others. The reason it chews Alkalines is they aren't made for high drain applications. Hence the new Duracell Ultras which try to overcome that. So buy the right batteries.. you don't see alkaline batteries in cell phones do you?  

What matters.. the pictures!

Getting the pictures on your computer is a snap, if you have problems, it isn't the camera, its Windows.  Trust me, I have years under my belt as a computer technician, and dealt with everything.. its Windows not the camera or software in this case.  The downloads are fast, the interface easy.. No problems or complaints there!

The actual pictures.  Yes, this camera is point and shoot. You can do that all day and you'll get good pictures. But take the time to learn how the camera behaves, and you'll get even better pictures. Overall the pictures are really nice, the sharpness could be better in some cases. But a simple photo program fixes that anyway, and you have to be looking to notice it. I have had no color problems. The one thing I have been extremely impressed with is the low light shots.  Some people who read this and own this camera may be raising an eye brow now.  You can get amazing pictures in low light conditions.  I have taken pictures at night with no lights on in my room and gotten it to take decent pictures from just the street light filtering in.  The trick is getting the right settings. The camera has a feature called a "bulb" shot which exposes for 1-2 seconds. Pair that with the right ISO (100,200,400) depending on the light, and you will get great pics in any light. Futz with the camera, change settings left and right, and you'll find that this thing can take pics in almost any situation.  

The pictures are clear, the resolutions are really nice. It is point and shoot, but you can get it to perform better if you take the time to learn what it likes and doesn't like.  Learn the settings. 

The camera has lots of features, and all of them seem to have uses.  Honestly, I don't have any complaints. I expected a lot, and got more than I expected.  Shop around... read the online manual (that is one thing that isn't so great.. no paper manual) and you should find the camera to perform to your requirements.

AND DON'T FORGET TO GET NiMH BATTERIES!!!!! (not NiCD)
