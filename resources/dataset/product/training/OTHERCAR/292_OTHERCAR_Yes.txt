            I've had my little hatchback for five years, and I hate to think of the day I'll have to give it up. It has survived the tests of several trips across the country, icy New England weather, winding mountain roads, big-city traffic, and full loads of teenagers and suitcases.

I learned how to drive on this car, and drove it through my last year of high school and all four years of college.  Its all-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes make it a safe, all-weather car for a teenager.  The quick brake response and tight turning radius has kept me safe through many novice driving mistakes.  Its reasonable gas mileage and general durability make it less expensive to maintain than bigger or older cars.  

As a more experienced driver, I have also realized how much fun my Subaru is to drive because it's so small and responsive.  My friends have nicknamed my car &quot;zippy&quot; because it feels so light and smooth to drive.  Also, the interior, including the back seat, is very comfortable, and surprisingly roomy for such a small car.

My only big complaint is that the thick metal corners connecting the windshield and the front windows create an annoying blind spot, especially when turning left.

In all, though, I LOVE MY CAR!<br><br>
