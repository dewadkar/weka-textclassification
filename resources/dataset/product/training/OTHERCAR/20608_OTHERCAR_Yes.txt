            The A4 has treated us very well, proving to be a safe, well-handling, reliable car.

A few months after we bought the car, one of family members hit a tree quite hard in it late at night. The front of the car crumpled up and absorbed the energy�he described the impact as "surprisingly soft". The seatbelt pretensioner fired and took in the slack and locked him in place. The airbag decided correctly not to fire�he walked away completley uninjured. Although the impact hit the front left wheel quite hard and broke the A-arm, the cabin did not deform whatsoever. It performed admirably and kept him completley safe.

The car has since been repaired and drives like always�playful, tight handling, incredible grip on the road, and extremely confident. Quattro All-Wheel-Drive is an excellent option. You feel like you are glued to the road, no matter what the conditions. We like in snow country, and in the winter, the car handles nearly like it's on dry road. Stunning.

The vehicle, when not crumpled up, is very handsome and tasteful. We have the Avant sport-wagon model, and it's every bit as handsome as the sedan. People sneer at station wagons, but the 1.8T has pep and the handling and ride is that of a sports car. If you want power, look at the S4 and S4 Avant, also excellent cars.

The headlights are extremely bright but the low-beams are focused as to not glare into other driver's eyes. The driving lights are low and help sweep the road with light. You even get a rear fog light on the driver's side to help people see you in low-visibility conditions.

The seats are magnificently sculpted and comfortable. The manual adjustment controls could use work, however, Audi could take a hint from it's sister company, Volkswagen. 

All 5 seating positions have height and horizontally-adjustable head restraints and 3-point seatbelts. Front, side, and head curtain airbags are standard equipment. In 2002, rear side impact airbags will also be available. The rear head restraints, when not in use, can be folded down for visibility. In all, a very safe car.

I've done a few panic stops in the car, and it stops shockingly fast. Four-channel, four-wheel disc ABS standard. Very nice. Just don't stop too fast or the person behind you in the Suburban with drum brakes might ram you. At least you have head restraints to keep you from whiplash.

The interior is the best I've seen�ergonomic, simple, well layed out. I like VW's purple lighting, but Audi's red lighting makes it look like an airplane cockpit. Takes a little getting used to, but is actually very easy on the eyes. The stereo sounds pretty good. The center screen displays a few useful things like approx. how many miles you have left to drive in the fuel tank.

On the other side, the car is small. Really small. Rear seat occupants better not be tall, although there's plenty of head room. The trunk isn't too bad. The A4 will grow in interior demensions for the 2002 model year.

The cup holders, as with practically every German car out there, stink. The Germans don't believe you should be drinking in the car anyway. No biggie.

One annoying issue is the hyper-sensitive motion detectors. Yes, is has motion detectors, mounted above every window. They sense somebody trying to reach into the car to grab something off the seat if the car is locked and sound the alarm. They work as advertised, but they tend to also detect wind and temperature changes on summer days. The alarm is anything but fiercful anyway, perhaps even anemic, and you can manually disable the motion sensors if you want to keep the windows down when you lock the car.

All in all, we're extremely pleased.
