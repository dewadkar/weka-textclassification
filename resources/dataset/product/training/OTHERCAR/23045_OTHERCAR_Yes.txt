            My husband gave me the Polaroid PDC 640 Plus digital camera for Christmas.  Actually he gave it to me two days early so I could load the software and know how to work it before the &quot;Big&quot; day.  It was so easy to figure out I really didn't need the two days, but I got a lot of enjoyment with it anyhow.  Then the &quot;Big&quot; day came, when all the kids and grandkids arrived for dinner and gift opening.  It was wonderful!  I got the best holiday pictures ever.  The wonderful thing is that you can see what the finished picture is like and if it's not satisfactory, just delete it and retake. 
I was able to take 45 photos at one time before downloading them onto the computer.  You can take 90 but I wanted to be sure of the quality of picture before I tried that out.  Downloading them onto the computer was so easy and fast.  Just turn off your computer, plug in the camera, turn camera and computer back on and go for it.  In a matter of minutes I had them all on the computer and enjoyed emailing some to friends and family.  After finishing all you have to do is turn your camera back on and delete all, then you are ready to go again.  Good thing too, because when watching the grandkids over new years eve we had new snow and got terrific pictures of all of them sledding.  
Now I ask you, what could be a better gift for a grandmother than that.  No more running out of film or waiting for it to be developed.  Wow...wish they had would have had one of these when my children were small.  
Being a gift I can't tell you what my hubby paid for this camera, but I believe retail is around $200, and worth every penny.  I had looked at other brands over the past year, but I am sure none of them could be as easy to use as this Polaroid 640, and the quality of pictures is excellent.  So, whether you are a proud grandma (like me) or just want a great quality digital camera for your money, I would say, &quot;Try the Polaroid 640, you won't be sorry&quot;.<br><br>
