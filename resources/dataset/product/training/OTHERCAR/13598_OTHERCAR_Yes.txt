            This opinion is for a 1991 miata, so keep that in mind.  

I moved to Los Angeles from the mid-west a few years ago and as a guy with his priorities strongly intact,what's the first thing one would do when moving to Southern California?  You buy a convertible my friend!

That's correct.  I sold my Honda and bought a 1991 Mazda Miata, silver exterior, black interior/5 speed/not too many extras.  Although this may not be the Audi TT or the Boxter that I would have liked,  I only had a few grand to spill out for my convertible.

I paid about 3,500 for my beloved Miata with just over 100,000 miles.  It has about 117k miles on it now and although I must admit it probably runs a little rougher than it did new,  it is still amazingly reliable(knock on wood).  I've owned it for about 4 months now and no visits to the shop.  

If you've read my other opinions, you know I like to skip all the specs and get right to the point.  You probably know the basics of the car. I'm here to tell you about ownership of this vehicle and what to expect.


First of all, I recommend gettting one with the glass rear window, to save yourself visibility problems in the present or near future.  

Next, the fun stuff.  Taking this car to the beach or just cruising around town is just plain fun.  If you're like me, this will be your first convertible and having no roof is all you want and the Miata is all you can afford. 

Well this car is way worth the 3k I spent on it. For three thousand dollars, I got a silver, sleek, shiny converible that although its not German,  if you squint a little at night, it looks like the BMW Z3.  

If you're a man and want this car here's what you need to know.   

Will I feel gay driving a Miata?   No

Will others question your sexuality simply for driving such a car?  Maybe, but cares.  

No matter what your sexual preference, this is a fun car for any man or woman.

Some people attach that stigma to this car, saying "thats a chick car,man"  I say no.   Whenever I cruise with my girlfriend to the beach with the wind blowing through the hair and sun beating down,  she admits that she gets a little excited.  Theres just something about a convertible. 

This is the most bang for your buck.  So if you don't have the cash, but do have the desire to own a convertible,  this is a highly recommended choice. Although its not a Boxter or a Z3,  you can pretend, right?
