            Just want to take a relaxing ride through the roads where there aren't cars or in a hurry to get to work, this car is for you. With 200 horsepower, the Accord will do all the work for you. This car is powerful, smooth, and neat. All you have to do is steer and pedal. All colors look good on this car, but let me suggest dark green or black. The 2000 Honda Accord EX V6 is a great car. You may look at everything else, but this is by far the best. Go take a look at it! I promise you this car you will not forget! Take it from me, I see one everyday, and the leather is great. Test drive it today!<br><br>
