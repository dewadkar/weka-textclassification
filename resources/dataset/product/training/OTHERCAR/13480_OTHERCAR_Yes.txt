            I bought my little 92 Metro in spring of 1994. Fresh out of college and looking for a good inexpensive piece of transportation. 
I decided on the Geo mainly because of price. Mine was only
$4900 and had everything I wanted at the time automatic,a/c 
and a decent stereo.I thought I will have it for a few years and trade up to something a little nicer.
Well here it is 9 years later and i still have this car,
Yes, I have had and have others , but this car is amazing I currently have 285,000 miles and it is still going. 

This car has been to all of the lower 48 states Mexico and Canada. I would not really suggest a long trip in this car if you are worried about comfort , your butt will fall asleep after about two hours and your back will start to ache, but the gas you save might just be worth it. On one trip I made it from St.Louis Mo. to Kansas City Mo. and back on a single tank! That is nearly 550 miles nearly 60m.p.g. and that is an automatic !

This little car is tough in other ways also. One late night after work I was driving home up some back roads in the country and a deer ran out in front of me. I slammed on the brakes and tried to stop, but sadly I did hit the poor thing. The front right fender and hood were damaged but the car was still able to be driven.
Now this car dose have some drawbacks, the tires don't last very long maybe 15 or 20,000, but at less than $100 for four installed you cant really complain, and some parts are expensive,like a starter will set you back abut $500 and an alternator almost $200. Somethings you would expect to be expensive are not new rotors (brakes) were only about $20 
and a master cylinder only $45. 
All in all this is the best car I have ever owned.
I will probably have it forever.
