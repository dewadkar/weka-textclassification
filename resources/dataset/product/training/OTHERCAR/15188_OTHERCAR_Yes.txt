            Sienna makes parenthood a lot more manageable. After all, it has the ride quality and services of a sedan, and its flexible interior is about the only thing that changes faster than the needs of your family. The stylish van has the smoothest ride you can get in a van and driving it is a breeze. The following are standard features of the Sienna :

As you can see it is a very resourceful minivan. It is the best in its class in safety and from personal experience I feel that it is he best you can get in the market. It does well in any weather including: rain, snow, sleet, and at night. It is great for long car trips due to the fact that the seats are so comfortable and the engine is so quiet. I have driven the van from New York to Richmond, VA and did not have any problems. There are no problems that I know of and work perfectly (including the tires). It is great for the family and has tremendous amounts of cargo space. The seats can be easily taken out and they can also be folded to avoid taking out the seats, which is very convenient. The stereo system is very clear and crisp. The following are the standard safety features:
SAFETY FEATURES 
*Driver and front passenger air bag Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)2 
*3-point seatbelts in all outboard seats with adjustable seatbelt anchors on front seats, driver's belt Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR); *Automatic/Emergency Locking Retractor (ALR/ELR) on all other outboard belts

I strongly suggest that if you should buy a minivan, you should buy the Toyota Sienna. I own both the Sienna and the Honda Odyssey and I believe that the Sienna has run better and more sufficiently than the Honda. It also did much better in the snow. The interior is much more sleek and the body is better as well. In other words, if you are going to buy a van, buy a Sienna.
