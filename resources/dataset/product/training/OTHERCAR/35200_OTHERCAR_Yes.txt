            Finally I was the proud new owner of one of my dream vehicles. It's silly but I've always loved the roll-down rear windows on SUVs and ever since I've had a license to drive I've wanted one. The K-series Blazers and the Broncos had them but it seems the 4Runner is the only one still being made. My fascination with these windows probably stems from the fond memories of my youth riding around in my friend's old Blazer with all the windows open including the rear one and the wind blowing through our hair. The feeling comes close to that of an open top vehicle but without all of the drawbacks.

Now that Toyota has added a control to roll the rear window down with the keyless entry remote you can open it as you walk up to your 4Runner and toss your gear in the back almost like a pickup truck. It is also convenient, when you need to transport long items, to just let them hang out the window.

Enough about my love for the roll-down rear window there are other things I like about my 4Runner. I think the 4Runner is rock solid off road even without any modifications which is rare among SUVs today. On the road I find the ride to be very smooth. Although it certainly doesn't handle like a good car would it is still capable enough to be my every day vehicle. I loved the 4Runner's performance in the snow this past winter. It took me everywhere I needed to go even with a couple feet on the ground.

I've heard several complaints about the seats in forums online. I'm about  6'1&quot; I have found them to be very comfortable actually. I would say try taking a long test drive if you think this might be a problem for you.

I do have a few complaints of my own. The gas gauge can be rather annoying. While the gas tank is 18.5 gallons the low fuel light will usually come on after using only 13-15 gallons. I've heard this is a common problem and have yet to hear of anyone getting this fixed. I've resorted to filling up sometime after the light goes on. I thought these warning lights were to indicate that you better get to a gas station right away but apparently with the 4Runner it just means you should probably consider filling up again in the next 50 miles.

I've also had trouble with wheel vibrations. Apparently the 4Runner wheels are difficult to balance and require a certain adapter on the wheel balancing machine. So if you notice a vibration around 65-70 mph take it back and get it rebalanced correctly.

Overall I love my 4Runner and am hoping I can keep it for a long happy life. I've had a few small problems and I wouldn't say that Toyota service is all that great but boy are their trucks solid.<br><br>
