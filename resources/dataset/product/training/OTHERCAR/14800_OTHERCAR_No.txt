            The S80 opened a new chapter for Volvo. Here is a car with all the traditional Volvo virtues wrapped up in a sleek package. The car offers several safety features that could make it a standout among upscale sedans. Acceleration is absolutely effortless with the T6 variant, and passenger comfort is outstanding.

Unfortunately the promise of the car is compromised by dreadful reliability and the poor support provided by the manufacturer. In three years, I have spent more time in dealerships than the aggregate total of dozens of cars over thirty years of vehicle ownership. 

When considering the value part of the ownership equation, the depreciation experience alone for this car makes it the most expensive car to drive among its competitors. So while this car is painful to own due to it's poor reliability, the pain is only starting until you try and get rid of it.

My car has had replaced four transmissions, ABS control unit, two throttle control modules, power steering rack, oil pick-up seals, two recalls, power seat control module, two radios, two antenna amplifiers, three door lock actuators, both struts, front shocks, rear rotors, power steering pump, tie rod ends, exterior roof moldings, rear window antenna, and a parcel of other items too numerous to mention.

From an execution perspective, the chassis dynamics are numb and disconnected; not up to the challenge of supporting the drivetrain.  The operation of the radio with a rotary knob for presets is not intuitive and a driver distraction. The digital dash displays cannot be seen in sunlight. Visibility to the rear quarters is poor, and the turning radius is very wide making for poor maneuverability.
