            Wow, what a score.  I had looked at the Solara about 1 1/2 years ago
but really wanted a convertible and at the time they didn't have any.

Now, finally I was able to score a Solara Convertible and I just love
my new car.  The convertible's are VERY hard to come buy, they are in limited production and most dealers are charging ridiculous premiums on this car.

I for one, do not see the point in paying a premium for a car, I honestly
find it to be an insult, however both my husband and myself wanted Solara's (he a hard top and me a convertible) so we were able to work
out a super deal with the dealership.

The convertible (and the hard top) both have super rides.  It reminds me
of the Lexus SC 400 I had a few years ago.  It's very smooth and quiet.

The convertible top goes up and down amazingly fast and with very little
effort on my part.  The sound system is &quot;ok&quot; however the cd's play great.
The radio is just &quot;ok&quot;.  

Price wise I think it's a smoking deal compared to most other convertibles
on the market.  

The gas mileage is great on both cars.  I have a V6 and my husband a V4
and we can't believe how great the mileage is on both our cars.

I would highly recommend this car to anyone....it's honestly one of the
best I've had.  The lines are smooth and sporty and it's just a great
all around car.

Also, before I go.....the back seat is a REAL back seat, unlike the other
convertibles I've owned in the past.....<br><br>
