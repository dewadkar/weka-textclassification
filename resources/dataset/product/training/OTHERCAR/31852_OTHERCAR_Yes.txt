            I say happily because the flat tire was on a rental car we were examining before leaving the rental driveway.  Another customer pointed to the tire which was almost flat!  

The car rental place upgraded us to the Concorde as they had no other car like we had lined up, I guess.  This car was wonderful.  It had all the perks.  Let me tell you a few.

We really liked the digital windows above the windshield.  One told how many miles worth of gas was in the tank (distance to empty).  This meant a lot to us as we had paid for a full tank and were to return it empty.  Well, at $2.40 a gallon of gas (this was Hawaii) we did not want to fill it up any more than we had to.  We turned it in with just 5 miles left!

There is a compass and outdoor temperature readout which came in handy when we drove from sea level to 10,023 feet above sea level.  We sent to the top of the Haleakala volcano and as we went higher, the temperature dropped a total of 30 degrees from when we started.

This road took us all morning as we could go only 15 miles an hour around the hairpin turns.  The road was steep but the car handled it perfectly without heating up even with the air conditioning working until near the top.

You can see your average miles per gallon in another window, and as you coasted you could see also how little energy it took.  Such entertainment!

We had a motorized sunroof.  What fun for this old granny!  I played with it until my husband made me quit!  I liked the leather seats and the roomy trunk, too, which took our huge hard-sided suitcases and two carry-ons with room to spare.

There were lots of controls for the cruise control on both sides of the steering wheel.  By the time we figured out how to use them all we were back home!  Our own car has controls for the radio on the steering wheel which we missed on the Concorde.

I don't know how many of the luxury features are included in the base price of the car, but the $22,000+ listed here would make it a steal if you got even a few.

For comfort and luxury, this is a car to consider.  We may the next time we buy a car.
