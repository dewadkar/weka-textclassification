            I have a 1992 240SX SE &quot;fastback&quot; I leased new at the end of the '92 model year.  I traded in a 1990 240SX at the time.  I liked the original '90 version of the car enough to trade up the second revision that appeared in '92.

In summary, the car is a great handling, great driving rear-wheel drive car.  I equipped the '92 with optional ABS, bigger factory wheels (205/55HR16) stiffer springs and the &quot;HICAS&quot; four-wheel steering option, as well as other options like a moonroof and upgraded stereo.  The 5 speed manual shift is smooth and quick.

Engine performance is adequate for normal to aggressive driving such as I do.  The 155HP DOHC motor (up from a 140HP SOHC in the '90) is fine for highway driving.  It's smooth and quiet compared to the '90 (DOHC helped there), but still lacks the kick of other &quot;sporty&quot; cars of the day such as the normally aspirated 300Z, Supra, etc.  The handling is great with very little body sway and drift in turns.  The HICAS option does help by steering and counter-steering the rear wheels a few degrees on turns above 35MPH, but it isn't an absolute necessity as the effect is slight.

Maintenance has been OK.  I had to replace the timing chain at 60K miles, and did contend with a front shimmy and multiple visits to the dealer that finally was rectified with a Nissan-supplied new set of front tires.  Other nits include numerous interior trim rattles that have developed over the years, as well as a power radio antenna that broke and took literally a full half day to remove and replace.  The car with 80K miles does not burn oil and otherwise has been fine.

The body interior is very roomy in front.  I am 6' and the moonroof was a requirement for adequate height.  The &quot;back seat&quot; is suitable only for small kids and grocery bags.  The hatch is huge when the rear set is folded down, though the rear springs do cut down on hatch space a bit.    The SE model includes all optional equipment of the lower 240SX model designations, such as variable-speed wipers, map and footwell lights, adjustable steering column, cruise control, etc.<br><br>
