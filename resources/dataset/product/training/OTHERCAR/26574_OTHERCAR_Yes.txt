            There is no mistake that Toyota tends to dominate the SUV market with its series of well-built SUVs that have come to be the synonym of reliability, comfort, class and superiority in engineering and design.  I am not writing the review of this vehicle only as a Toyota user.  I will admit that I have been a secret admirer of this Japanese automaker.  Ever since my wife's and kids' lives were spared in a mid-section accident thanks to the safety gear on the Corolla, I have been a devout fan.  Just like many Toyota owners may admit, there is great reason for celebration and bragging after all.  Toyota's SUV offerings include the following brands <b>Sequoia, 4Runner, RAV4, Highlander and Land Cruiser</b>.  While the <b>2003 4Runner</b> is entering its fourth generation, the automaker did not hesitate to improve it.  It is not going to rest on its laurels while the competitors are dying to gain a piece of this market position.  Who among them would not want to be Toyota with all of these high-volume sales vehicles?

<b>Let's cut through the chase:  What's this SUV all about?</b>

Built in Japan, this larger and roomier SUV is good on gas and offers the driver a great ride.  That's what I found out when I took the Limited V-8 4WD model on the 180 junction between freeways 41 and 99.  On an overcast day, I took my tester to find out what it is made of.  Right off the bat, I will admit that this SUV has great technological advancements in many areas.  It's a perfect vehicle for those who will spend huge amount of time in the driver's seat in all kinds of road conditions.  

The 4Runner is offered in SR5, Sport Edition and Limited models.  You can choose to have one with the larger V-6 engine or another one with the super, performing V-8 mover.  While a four-speed electronically controlled automatic gearbox is mated to the six-cylinder engine (4ECT-i) the eight-cylinder  comes equipped with a (5ECT) five-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.  Now, this is a first for Toyota.  This is the first time you will find that Toyota uses this type of transmission in a Toyota light truck.

All the four-wheel drive 4Runners are outfitted with a multi-mode shift-on-the fly 4WD system with a Torsen sensing type limited-slip differential.  What this means is that with the system onboard, you are sure to enjoy stability in all road conditions.  That's what I found out when I had a take a detour due to some major construction on the freeway junction.  

<b>Do the competitors stand a chance?</b>

Not really.  The 2003 Toyota 4Runner has the following competitors:  2003 Ford Explorer, 2003 Nissan Xterra, Honda Elements etc.  With the type of improvements on this SUV, the competitors will have to be very convicing to snatch a Toyota fan.  During my test drive, I found the 4Runner to be very responsive.  It performs to satisfaction.  The ride was smooth and quiet.  Its engine provided a solid performance.  There was no whining and odd sound coming off the hood.  In fact, I barely heard that the engine was turning.  

You will be pleased to find some of the following amenities on this truck.  With a larger cabin, well-placed and lit control panels, the 4Runner offers more cupholders and storage space.  A mother with young children can easily use the space to store car seats and other items such as grocery and suitcases.  The 60/40 split rear seat does not require the removal of the headrests in order to fold flat. The SUV is equipped with a draw bar, high-capacity seven-pin electrical connector for trailer wiring and pre wire for an electric trailer brake controller.  A standard tow hitch receiver bolts directly to the rear frame is also available.  So if you have a boat, it will be easy for you to haul it to your favorite lake or outdoors site.  

<b>My recommendations</b>

The previous offerings of the 4Runner have proven that is truck is a reliable brand.  You can basically run them to the ground.  The 4Runner will never let you down as long as you maintain it properly.  That's true of any vehicles any way.  If you are an outdoors type, consider the following:

<b>Safety features</b>:  Four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock and electronic brake force with brake assists, dual front airbags, vehicle skid control, traction control, hill-start assist control, remote keyless entry, engine immobilizer, full size spare tire and engine/fuel tank skid plates, down-hill assist control, fog lamps, anti-theft system and HomeLink garage door opener on the Limited Edition.  Then, you can get options such as side-impact airbags, front/rear curtain shield airbags etc.

This is a great vehicle if you choose to invest in it.  

Safe and responsible driving!
