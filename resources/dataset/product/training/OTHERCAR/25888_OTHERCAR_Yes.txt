            The 4-wheel drive Cherokee is available in six models - SE and Sport two door models, and SE, Sport, Classic, and Limited four door models. Formerly only a package, Jeep has now made the Limited the highest trim model. Features include a standard AM/FM Cassette radio and available 16-inch aluminum rims. Sienna pearl coat, patriot blue pearl coat, and silverstone pearl coat are new exterior colors for this year. Standard features include a day/night rear view mirror, power steering, and front and rear stabilizer bars. Air conditioning, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes, and the Convenience Group are options for this years Cherokee. The Convenience Group includes cruise control and a leather wrapped tilt steering wheel.

The above is almost direct from Jeep,the Classic lists for about $1,300 more than the Sport model.  The features additional features include seats, trim, and a seemingly more amount of insulation.  The seats alone are what convinced me to go up to the Classic.  for a wide bodied person like myself, it makes all the difference in the world.  Overall, after the first 1000 miles, I am extremely happy  with my purchase!
