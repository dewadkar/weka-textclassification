            	I bought a 1999 Jetta Wolfsburg about six months ago.  To be honest, I didn't really do a lot of homework on the Jetta.  However, I did read the Edmunds review, and they gave it a pretty good review.  I bought the car because I really needed one, and I got an amazing price on it from a local dealer.  Plus, I liked the looks, and the Wolfsburg package made it kind of hard NOT to get.
	The Wolfsburg package comes with a bunch of options the base GL doesn't come with.  The first thing you'll notice is the nice 5 spoke wheels that set it apart from the Gl's ugly hubcaps.  Also, it has a spoiler that actually adds to the sportiness of the car.  When you look inside the car you'll see the white dials of the speedometer and tach.  That really makes it look smooth.  Also, the sport seats that come with it look much much better than the stock GL seats.  Lastly, mine came with a 6-disc CD changer which is pretty nice, although it is inconvenient in the trunk.  Also, the changer has a little lag from when you press the button on the radio to when the CD player actually switches tracks.  
	Overall, I would say that the 1999 Wolfsburg Jetta is a very nice car at the price I got, which was about $3000 under Kelly Blue Book.  At the Blue Book price, the car is a little too expensive for what you get.  
	For one thing the car is too slow.  Two competitors, the Honda Civic, and the Dodge Neon, both which cost less, are noticeably faster.  The VW 2.0 engine is rather pitiful.  The best 0-60 I've been able ot get (using the Gtech pro) is a hair over 9 seconds.  Also, I have had some funny problems that I know my friends with 99 civics and neons haven't had.  For example, my the heat shield that covers the Catalytic converter rattles annoyingly.  Also, for some reason, the &quot;malfunction&quot; light comes on on my dash, and then goes off seemingly randomly.
	These problems aside, and without regard to price, the Jetta is a nice ride that sure gets compliments from my friends.  Also, the standard shifter is very smooth and it is almost impossible to stall on.  I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who can get a good deal on it, or if you just do not like cars like the Civic or the Neon.

UPDATE:   It has now been over a year since I bought the Jetta.  I got the heat shield rattle fixed.  It was a simple fix.  The dealer just wrapped the shield with some sort of cloth to keep it from rattling.  The malfunction light still goes on and off randomly.<br><br>
