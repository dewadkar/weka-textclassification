               This was a great attempt by Cadillac to make a luxury SUV but.....it's just a Chevy or GMC Tahoe masked by some fancy molding, neat exhaust pipe, and a grill with a Cadillac emblem on it. What is the point of this vehicle? No one knows. With a price of over $42,000, one could perhaps buy two other vehicles for the same price that would do the job. Is this a vehicle that is used for &quot;work&quot; purposes? Not at all - it's plush leather interior would never see the likes of dirty work boots or filthy work jeans. This is an unnecessary vehicle that only people who like to show themselves off drive. Its purpose is not practical and its price too high. <br><br>
