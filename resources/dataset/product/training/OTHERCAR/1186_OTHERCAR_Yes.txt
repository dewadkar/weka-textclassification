            Dodge has done something excellent here. It has made a car to compete with the Ford escort and the Chevy cavalier. It really gives both of these cars a run for their money. With a nice 2.0 liter 132 horsepower engine makes this 4 cylinder car get great gas mileage and still has good pickup. In the city it gets up to 28 miles to the gallon and highway it gets 39 miles per gallon. The interior is a very nice design. It is small but still has an unusual amount of leg room and everything is within the driver's reach that he/she would need. Fully loaded, the neon comes with a great deal of features, such as a 6 disc cd changer and power locks/windows. Overall, I would say for a kid at college or for an economical car, the Neon is a great deal.<br><br>
