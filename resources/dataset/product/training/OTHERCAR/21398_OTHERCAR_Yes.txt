                I love my Toyota. I bought this vehicle because it's roomy enough inside and the gas mileage is great. You get over 20 miles in the city and about 30 miles on the highway. With the price of gas these days, it was a great choice. I would recommend one to anyone. I drove a van for a few years and when I drove the Toyota, it was like driving a toy car. It was so easy and comfortable to drive. This car is for everyone even those with a small family. There's even more room in the back seat than in the front. If you are looking for a car that gives you great gas mileage and a car that will last for years this car is for you. The only peole that shouldn't buy a car like this is someone that is used to driving to driving a large luxury car.<br><br>
