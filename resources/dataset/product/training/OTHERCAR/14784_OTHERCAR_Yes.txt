            Smile! It is another digital camera, or so it seems. You might be saying big deal there are tons of digital cameras what makes this one so special? Well with the umax astra cam there is more than meets the eye. It has so many features built in that it is almost unbelivable!

With a digital camera you want one that can be connected to the computer. Of course! What a great idea! Why didn't I think of that? Ok so a digital camera being able to be connected to the computer is not that big of a deal but what is important is how it is connected. Thw umax astra cam has an easy usb conecction to windows 98 pcs. The usb connection makes it easy to hook up the camera to your computer.

The quality of pictures from this digital camera are amazing! It ranges from 640 by 480 pixels all the way to 1280 by 960 pixels. This means that you are going to be able to take pictures with great quality and detail. It also means that you are going to be able to better preserve the memories of an event that you will want to look back on for years to come. Everything from graduations to weddings. The reason why it is important to have a good digital camera is to make sure that you capture exactly how the moment was when you took it so you can always remember it.

What I like best about the umax astra cam is the built in microphone for voice recordings. It holds 20 seconds of voice input at on one recording. This is an excellent feature if you are taking a picture and wanted to give a brief explnation about the picture such as what is going through your mind when you took the picture.

This digital camera has loads of features as I said earlier. It has a cradle docking system for downloading. The download speed is about 3 seconds per image. That is a very good speed when it comes to downloading. The memory of the umax is 4mb internal flash memory. This amount of memory is good size for a digital camera in its price range. If you want more memory you can always buy memory flash upgrades but be warned they are expensive. The camera runs off of rechargeable triple a batteries. The battery life depends upon how actively you use it. 

The umax astra cam is a great digital camera that has a lot of features that make taking pictures more enjoyable. For the price and the quality of the picture it gives you the umax is a great deal.
