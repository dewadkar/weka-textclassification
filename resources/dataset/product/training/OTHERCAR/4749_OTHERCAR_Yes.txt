            When I went to get into this car, the first thing that popped in my mind was Matthew McConaughey's great line from Dazed and Confused - &quot;Alright, alright, alright!&quot;.  This is one seriously sweet looking car.  As soon as you sit inside and close the door, you will know that you are inside a quality automobile.

This car is dead quiet.  If you are sitting inside with the engine running idle, you can't hardly tell that the car is turned on.  There is plenty of head room in front and back, which is nice for a guy my height (6'2&quot;).  I sat in the back seat with a friend up front who is 6'5&quot;.  We were both pretty comfy, but another inch or so and we'd have been a little cramped.  In a wreck, we would surely both have our knees wrenched.

The seats are very nicely designed.  They are firm, very adjustable, and solid.  The dashboard layout is very clear and there are lots and lots of little controls to manipulate.  Everything is easily reached and clearly marked.  This is a very well designed interior.

The A4 2.8 has got some serious pep.  If you stomp this baby to the floor, you just may subject yourself to some whiplash.  It fairs excellently in both acceleration and high-end acceleration, making it great for passing on highways and interstates?  The gas mileage is also fairly decent when you consider the performance.

I do have one small complaint about this car.  I am reviewing the silver model with the black and gray interior.  The lower side molding of the car is black, which shows scuffs very easily.  Getting in and out of this car can leave marks on the black.  They should have gone with a gray color instead.  Hopefully they will realize this and change the scheme.  However, this little problem is merely cosmetic.  I love this car.<br><br>
