            The warrenty on our Fiat Brava was just running out, and we were considering the next car to buy.

The things we wanted were: Air Conditioning (Britain is getting hotter as well as wetter, and trips to Italy and france had pursuaded us that Aircon was not the luxury it appeared to be), and more space (a two-year-old needs a whole load of stuff carted around with him).

After a bit of research our options were the Fiat Multipla, the Cruiser or the Mercedes A class.

We test-drove the Fiat. It looked bizarre, and handled like a milk float. No dice. We tried the Cruiser. It was easy to drive, fun (everyone looks at you) and basically love at first sight. We didn't even test drive the Merc.

So, we put in an order. It took six months to come. Yes, six months.

When we were thinking of buying, I checked out Epinions for what people thought. Most of the negative feelings seemed to be that the car is underpowered: "Don't go up hill", "Don't put all the kids in it", "Don't try and pull onto the freeway". Oddly, all of these seemed to come from people who didn't own the car: some didn't even seem to have driven one.

So, the straight dope: Unless there's a radical difference between the US model and the one we drive, all of that's fantasy. We live on a very steep hill - Lewes actually means "The Hill" in anglo-saxon. We've loaded the car and a roof box up to the gullet to go on holiday, and there's no trouble getting up hills. For that matter, there's no problem going on motorways, either - even French motorways (French driving is "interesting" - not nearly as scary as the italians, but interesting) It cruises happily at 70 (when cruise control really comes into its own). And I find it dead easy to park considering its size.

One cute feature is the hooks for the cargo net under the rear platform - perfect to hang your Tesco's bags from so you don't spill groceries all over the car.

One thing we really like is that the heater is so powerful: When it's below zero and snowing, hot air is coming out before we've got 100 yards down the road. I guess that's the result a a car built for the range of American temperatures.

There are annoyances: The warning pings which go off every time you do something the car doesn't like are irritating (one always goes off when I try to do a hill start - which I do every day coming out of the garage. Don't americans do hill starts? Oh yes, and why can't you still have the radio on when you're filling up with petrol?

But in general, I love it. They just don't make enough of them.
