            I received this Camera as a gift for Christmas from my Mother in law.  I absolutely love this camera.  I haven't gotten a roll of film developed since I received it.  I chose this Camera at first for the name, I figured that it is primarily a camera company so they know how to take pictures.  I was right, the pictures on this Camera are amazing, the color and quality beats all other pictures I have seen.  It comes with an 8MB compact flash card, that all though it only takes a few pictures before becoming full, I have taken over 700 pictures with it since Christmas.

Several of my Family members have other Digital Cameras, and even they say that the Kodak DC3400 takes better pictures then theres do.  The Price also can't be beat.  I know other people who have paid twice what I have for a Camera that takes very Digital Looking photo's.

The only things I do not like about this camera is the fact that it is bulky, and it runs through batteries within hours of first putting them in the Camera.  

But Overall I highly recommend this Camera.  I would gladly pay a higher price then what I got it for just to have the Quality of the Photo's that I get out of this Camera.
Kodak has really done it again.
