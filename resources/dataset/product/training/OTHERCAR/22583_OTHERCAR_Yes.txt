            My firebird is the fourth car I have ever owned and it is the most reliable out of all cars. I have had this car since it has had 97,000 miles and it now has 122,000 and I haven't had one problem with it other than basic maintenance like brakes, oil changes, and spark plugs. I love this car for the reliability, the quickness, cornering ability, and the overall performance. The bucket seats are very comfortable and it even has bucket seats in the back that are comfortable although there is not much leg room in the back. I love the smooth ride it gives you as you soar down the highway without any wind coming through the windows and hardly an road noise at all. I would prefer this car over just about any other car. It is low cost and easy to repair although I still have not yet had to do anything to it. My firebird is also easy and cheap to upgrade. It is a good school car and it is also a good car to travel in cause the seats are very comfortable and you know you will get where you need to go. You can always trust a 1991 Pontiac firebird.
