            I don't think I will ever forget this bloke. A good bloke, but, well, when it came to four wheel drives or 4X4 he was your classic banana!



He and his wife and a couple of others had come here to Adelaide for a holiday - hey, nothing wrong with that, was there? Told you he was okay really. But the trouble came when we outside the hotel right in downtown Adelaide when he suddenly says "there goes a $x$ the same as mine - look, see that"....er..er..I better not say in cased I get sued!




Anyway he gets his mouth into top gear "I've noticed you have all the same ones as us", he says. And then he goes on to tell me how wonderful his is, the stereo you know, and how it cruises on the interstates and all that stuff. Now this bloke was just the same as most Australians - they never get their tyres dirty. So why do they buy them - in a word - coz they is cool brother, cool!




But everyone wants to believe they have the best one, and for a small minority they actually need the best one. So which is the best one, or are they all the same?




Well I can promise you they are not all the same. Many, for the purpose, are complete heaps of junk. Some are quite good but there is only one that makes the whole grade. And how do I know - I'm a bloody Australian. That wouldn't say much though would it because as I have already said we have them all too and they all make it over the Sydney Harbour Bridge, so that's something. But if you really need the best, or if you want to be able to say you have the best and prove it, then sorry folks, it has to be a Toyota or as we nickname them Tojo (as in toe joe).




Now think of it this way. If you owned a Cattle Station (multi million acre ranch) in Outback Australia, or you had the need to drive out in the never never, or donga, or nothingness you need a vehicle that is going to make it - we are literally talking life and death here sometimes. We are not going to be listening to music systems and other gee wiz paraphernalia when we are choosing a vehicle are we - no way! Not that we can't have all that, but it really isn't relevant.



Coming back to our Cattle Station owner or worker, typically it is about thirty miles to the front gate along a track that did see a grader when it was first put there about forty years ago. It's become a bit bumpy, but we get used to it and know where thee biggest bumps are anyway - so no worries. We get to the road and of course there is no road - we just know whether we turn right or left - not too hard to remember. So say we turn right we see a marker post about every hundred or so yards going off way in to the distance. Yep, this is the road all right - I can even see my tyre tracks from a fortnight ago - and I kid you not many roads in the outback are simply marker posts to follow - never been graded or marked in any other way. Often we would follow this none too busy one vehicle a week at most road for about a hundred or two hundred miles the come to a major road. Well, it's been graded, well actually these main roads are graded once a year whether they need it or not! But they might carry three cars a day so it's worth it - don�t know why they are always rougher! Eventually we hit "The Bitumen", two thousand miles of it running between Darwin and Adelaide. A near perfect road, wee could ride a bike from here. 




Now to about two hundred thousand people spread well out right through the outback this is life. And see if you can find anything resembling the size of a Landcruiser without Toyota written on it! You'll be damn lucky. And they do try them all don�t worry. They are not the cheapest and there is only that one reason they "own" this place - they are the best and have been for quite some time now.




So now you know what to get - just get the model that suits you from cab-chassis it wagon.



The basics are above and really it is best to choose your options once you decide on the model that is best for you.
