            Current C-Class billboard ads present the following idea:  
&quot;Look like a million, but pay around $34K.&quot;
America's 'Baby Benz' is undoubtedly classy and sassy.  The C-Class can make its driver feel like they're stepping into and driving away like a millionaire.  M-B enthusiasts bask in the glory of its S-Class image in a smaller, much less-expensive package.  Unfortunately, this feeling of a million $$$ stops only at its looks.  Frankly, this is a very un-German-like Mercedes-Benz, and should be be priced less.  Of course, you can't expect them (Daimler-Benz) to admit their shortcomings and allow Audi &amp; BMW to pull away with the bigger bucks.

I've been a Mercedes-Benz enthusiast most of my life... having gone through proud ownership of 3 S-Classes (one after another) and later a C-220.  Now, my 220's the main workhorse of my household, but not due to due reliability or performance.  The C-220 is built like it &quot;came out of the assembly line on a Friday evening closing hour&quot; and definitely drives unlike a German automobile.  It's quite a shame to have wasted tons money on such a car.  Earning the title 'main workhorse' is not a complement.  It simple means it's not worth saving up your excitement for a fancy weekend getaway on this car... just my 'average Joe' which, if stolen or damaged by another party, won't break my heart once she's gone.  Heck!  It's insured anyway!  The only benefit the C-Class gives me is its ability to look good and look expensive.

Why is it that Mercedes-Benzes are usually equipped under par to its competition?  What's with skinny tires and small-ish wheels?  No Euro side markers?  Unless you acquired the very expensive C36 or ultra expensive C43, you're stuck with awkwardly bent dual tailpipes without chrome tips! Stereo?  What stereo??!!!  My speakers sound like a transistor radio!!!  M-B Tech instead of real leather?  Currently at over 34-Grand new, bring back the leather!

I'd still take the luxurious cabin anytime over any BMW 3-Series, but not over an Audi A4 2.8 Quattro priced less.  Still, I take pride glancing at the that 3-point star forward over the hood.  It still makes me feel smarter than those who look out for their 'maiden' on their Rolls Royce hood. <br><br>
