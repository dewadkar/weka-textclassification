            After totaling my Dodge Ram 1500 quad cab in an auto accident(not my fault incidentally), I found myself in need of a new P/U.  The Dodge, conveniently, was towed to the storage lot of a nearby GM dealer.  After looking over the old Dodge, I decided to do a little research on GM trucks and went back the next day to look at a 2003 Sierra Denali in Onyx Black.

As I walked up on the Denali the next day, I knew it was my next truck as soon as I got within 50 feet of it.  The 2003 Sierra Denali is one sharp looking pickup.  Opening the door reveals an interior that just doesn't get any better.  I'm 6'-5" tall and weigh 270lbs so I need a lot of headroom, legroom, and hiproom.  No problem with the 6 way power adjustable seats that include power adjustable lumbar support.  The seats are comfortable yet firm.  No more back aches from sitting in the drivers seat for hours.  You can recall seat settings for 2 different drivers at the touch of a button and if your 5'-2" tall and weigh 90 pounds you can adjust the drivers seat and be just as comfortable as me.

The six speaker Bose stereo system is spectacular and you get a 6 cd changer as standard equipment although you'll probably never use it if you order the satellite XM radio option which you should.  The XM radio gives you 100 channels of crystal clear audio and no matter what you like to listen to, you'll find it on XM radio.

The list of features is too long to cover in this review.  There's not many options available for this truck but that's because they are already installed as standard equipment.

The Onstar system, standard of course, is nice to have if you get in trouble out in the boondocks.  You'll get one year free when you buy the truck.  I got about 90 minutes of free onstar phone time from the dealer.  It's a very safe way to make and receive calls while driving.  To make a call, you press one button, say "dial", the onstar system will say "number please" etc. ... all hands free.  Pretty cool to talk to your truck and have it talk back.

The 6 liter Vortec engine (364 cu in) provides 325 HP.   The gas mileage isn't that great but if your a person that can afford a $43,000 pickup truck, your probably not worried about the price of gasoline.

The 4 wheel steering allows the Denali to handle the turns unlike any full size vehicle I've ever driven.  The turning diameter is 2 feet less than a Corvette Coupe and 3.4 feet less than a Camaro.  The feeling in the turns is something you should experience yourself with a test drive.  If you test drive one of these, don't take it out on the freeway ... find a sharp winding road somewhere.  Maneuvering into tight parking places with a pickup truck is no longer a problem.

If you have a trailer to tow and maaneuver around, this is the best vehicle on the market for that job ...nuff said.  You can change the stifness of the shocks at the touch of a button ...nice.

I could go on for hours, bu simply put, this is the happiest vehicle purchase I have ever made.  The folks at GM hit a homerun with this one.  This truck is a Luxury vehicle and a workhorse at the same time.  Your gonna love it ... I guarantee it!
