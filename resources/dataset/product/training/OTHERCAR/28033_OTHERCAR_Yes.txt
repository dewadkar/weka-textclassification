            We bought a Plymouth Sundance for the affordability.It's a small 4-door
car.It is a great 1st car to have.It gets great gas mileage,a 4cylnder with get-up and go,and runs pretty good.We were in an auto accident about a month ago in this car,(I was driving)another vehicle slammed on their
brakes right in front of us,and we did'nt have time to stop,so I tried to
slam on my brakes but still went under the trailer of the vehicle(electric
truck w/trailer) in front of me. My whole front end was under his trailer,
let's just say that my moter got relocated almost into my lap.The drivers
side airbag went off and all the seatbelts tightened up extremely.No one
in the car got hurt with the minor exception of major brusing from the
seat belts which the police and insurance adjuster all said saved all of
our lives.<br><br>
