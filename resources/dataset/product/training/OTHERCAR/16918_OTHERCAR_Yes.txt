            Twenty inches of snow in two days, and another inch of ice under that.  My wife and I have owned other SUVs, and even currently own a Jeep, but this is by far the best handling vehicle we have ever had the pleasure of driving in bad conditions!  Jeeps, Broncos, and Blazers by the handful on the sides of the road....and not a single slide from the Outback!

With the heated seats and a heater that could almost toast bread, this is one automobile that is just looking for a blizzard to play in!

Dual airbags, all wheel anti-lock brakes, and one of the best crash test scores in the industry....you probably won't ever need it, but it's good to know it's all there!
