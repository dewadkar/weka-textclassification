            I just bought my 3rd Mazda 626. Previously, I've owned an '85 DX and a '90 LX. I kept the 1990 for 10 years and 154K miles of great service. In fact, it was such a good car that I sold it to a friend for his teenage son to drive - the kid just loves it. 626's were a bit small and tinny in the early years, improved greatly by the time I bought the second one in 1990. Other than scheduled maintenance and normal replacements (tires and exhaust), it was probably the most trouble-free car I have yet owned. Clutch was still original. Rear brakes were replaced 3 times, but front brakes only once. 

What a jewel the 2000 is! I test drove an LX V6 for comparison sake - I had not planned on buying another Mazda only because I thought I wanted a bigger car. Well, I was impressed. When talking to the dealer about ordering the color and options I wanted, I stumbled across a ES V-6 demo with 6K miles. Silver, leather, ABS, traction control - it's got it all! The only options I don't have are the rear spoiler and fog lights. 

Anyway, if there are any previous generation 626 owners reading this - and you have not driven a current 2000 - do yourself a favor and see what Mazda has done this year. The ES is as close to a Millenia you will get at about 2/3 the price. 

I plan on keeping this one for 10 years.<br><br>
