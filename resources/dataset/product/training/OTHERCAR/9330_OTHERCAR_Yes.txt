            I ordered four digital cameras in the past year, and returned all but the Ricoh 5000.  The picture quality is fantastic.  There are many features on this camera I still haven't used, but I am achieving great results with the basic settings.  This is the only camera I tried that produced excellent quality photos in 5x7 and over sizes - the photos print beautifully right from the computer.  I especially appreciate the protective cover over the LED screen.  The camera has 8Mg internal storage, but accepts Smart Media cards, so I can take it on trips without my computer handy.  Also, cables are provided to output your pictures to a VCR, which has worked well when I went to my mother's where I didn't have computer access.  There is nothing I do not like about this camera!<br><br>
