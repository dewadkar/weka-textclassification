            This is a fantastic camera as long as you don't need the extra features like zoom. This camera is extremely easy to use and takes sharp in-focus pictures, even of moving objects. The price is only $149.
I recommend a Flash Path sandisk for smartmedia to load the pictures onto the computer. This camera uses up to an 8 meg smartmedia.
I used this camera for a year before I accidentally smashed it on vacation this past summer. I even was a runner up in a photo contest with this camera. It is one of the simplest camera I have ever used. The pictures are great unless you try to blow them up to 8 x 10.
I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking to buy a digital camera for the first time. It is simple enough for a child to use. My year-old granddaughter knew how to turn on the camera (by opening the lens cover) and how to preview the pictures, so anyone can use this camera without having to study the instruction book.<br><br>
