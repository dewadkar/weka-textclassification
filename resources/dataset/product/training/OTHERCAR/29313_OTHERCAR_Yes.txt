            I bought my first car in 1993.  It was a three-year old, two door Chevy Blazer.  I still have it.  It is now ten years old and I have never had a problem with it.  It has survived ten, that's right, ten New England winters and seven cross country journeys.  The back seat is roomy enough to fit three comfortably.  Or, you can fold down the back seat and fit all of a college student's earthly possessions.  It's not one of those &quot;family&quot; SUV's, like a Grand Cherokee that Long Island mothers use to shuffle their kids from band practice to Ballet.  This is a tough car that can drive through a snowstorm down a Vermont mountain.  It has great traction.  And people love it.  I have never gotten as many compliments on anything other than my Blazer.  <br><br>
