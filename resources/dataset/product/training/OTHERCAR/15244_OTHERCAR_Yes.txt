            I have been crazy about the body styling of this vehicle ever since I first saw its twin 'sister' car, the <i>Oldsmobile Calais</i> in the mid 1980's. My sister bought a Calais (ordered to her specifications) and it was such a cool looking car that I practically drooled with envy. It had a ton of electrical problems though and she didn't keep it long. They discontinued that model several years later. However, I was happy to see that they continued to make the <b>Pontiac Grand Am</b>, which as it turned out, is a better car.

Always having been a GM lover, I was very impressed when a friend of mine bought her Grand Am in about 1990. She kept it for quite some time having traded it just a few years ago for a truck more suited for the area she moved to. Another sister of mine bought her Grand Am in the early 1990's and commuted 50 miles each way several times a week  throughout her college career. Then she joined the Air Force and brought it to Germany with her. My turn came next. I wanted this car for so long, but wasn't quite in a position to purchase a new one. So in 1994 I went hunting and found a used 1991 in almost mint condition with low mileage. I've never been sorry.

My experiences with this car have been varied; but one thing stands out in my mind. In speaking with a mechanic I had for many years, I was told that people who do very little driving and/or very little highway driving are going to have multiple problems as opposed to those who don't. That short description is me to the end. In the six years I've owned this car I've only taken one long trip (about 2,000 miles total). Most of my driving is within the city limits with a scattered jaunts out to visit relatives/friends who live outside the city. According to my old mechanic, this could ruin a car. 

Ha! Ha! I say to him. Other than the usual maintenance (oil &amp; filter changes, tires, etc.), I've only had to change the brake pads and muffler. Everything else is nine years old and working fine. 

I have the two door sedan - slightly more sporty looking, but very comfortable. While I have no problem with parking, the length of the doors do prohibit extremely small places. Bucket seats in the front and a 'bench' seat in the back hold four adults very perfectly with ample leg room both front and back. My only problem is the that instead of a straight seat in the back, it has a 'hump' making in uncomfortable for a fifth person. Children are fine with it, however. The trunk space is huge for a mid-size car.

I know that soon I'll have to buy a new car. And I also know that I'm heading back to the Pontiac dealer. This one is a keeper.
