            When I bought the car I had just sold my 1984 Camaro Z28 and was looking for something with more power and better looks.  I was deciding between a 3000GT and a Dodge Stealth.  However, my heart was set on a Firebird.  So I picked up a bargain trader and began searching.  I found two Firebirds, but only one of them was a Trans Am, so I went and took a look at it.  It was in excellent condition, except for a few cigarette burns, and a few days later it was mine.  

I love almost everything about the car.  I've always had a place in my heart for Firebirds and now that I have one I'm very happy.  The design of the car seems to be perfectly made for me and everything is just within reach.  The seats sit very comfortably even after hours on the road.

The suspension on the car is pretty tight, which I like.  Handling is great.  The steering is tight, and it seems as if it'll turn on a dime.  There is also a lot of power behind a Firebird and it has great throttle response, as well as very good brakes.

This car is for anyone who is a sports car fan.  If you like to cruise around town and show off it's the car for you.  However if you are the more luxurious type and don't like feelings every bump in the road then maybe you should consider a different car.<br><br>
