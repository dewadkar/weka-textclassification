            The new 2000 Subaru Outback Sedan Limited is an outstanding newcomer. This &quot;Utility&quot; vehicle not only has Subaru's 20+ years of all wheel drive experience,anti-lock brakes, side impact airbags (mounted in the side of the seats to be useful to all size people)...etc. It drives like a dream, it can hold a corner like a corvette, stop on a dime, and cruise through mud, snow, sand and just about anything else. The interior is top notch with heated leather seats and leather steering wheel, shift knob, etc. I feel like I'm driving a $50,000 car....consumer reports loves the reliability of Subaru and not to mention the safety (did you see Dateline NBC?) this vehicle has an integrated antenna in the rear window, defrost for the side mirrors....a heated windshield, Benz-like knotched shifter and just about everything else we all want ....THIS IS A MUST DRIVE CAR!!!
