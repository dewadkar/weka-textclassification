            This is my second foray into the world of digital cameras. My first in 1998, was a 640 x 480, battery munching Quicktake 150, this model shows how far technology has come in the ensuing years.
The Olympus D-370 packs a lot of features into its small case. 
Let's start with the images, the camera shoots well in a range of lighting situations, although indoors without flash, one needs to switch to the 'indoor lighting' mode otherwise everything takes on a red hue. 
The images are good but mostly on the light side and benefit from a tweak in the 'levels' in an image retouching program like Photoshop. Shooting outdoors in low light the shots tend to be a little grainy in the detail, however this is to be expected from a camera making only a 1.3 megabyte file.
I am a Macintosh user and the camera appears on the desktop as soon as it is plugged in without any problems whatever. The battery life is mightily improved from my old model and I can go for about a week on one set.  I have a 32 meg flash card and can shoot about 50 shots at high res. I wouldn't recommend shooting any lower than the 'web' setting as you can always reduce the image size, but not enlarge without getting excessive pixellation. 
The movie feature is cute, but not really relevant to me. The few times I have used it, the images seem to be very 'noisy' and are more suited to indirect light. I suppose they are OK for posting to the web.
The menu system is well laid out and easy to use, and seems to have a great range of features for a camera of this price. I do have trouble sometimes remembering how to get to certain features (like the self timer), but this will come with familiarity.
All in all, a wonderful camera for the digital neophyte, I think it represents tremendous value.  I bought mine from Amazon for $189.00 with a case and some image retouching software.
The only real downside? It has given me a taste of the potential of this new medium and a more expensive camera is probably on the way.
