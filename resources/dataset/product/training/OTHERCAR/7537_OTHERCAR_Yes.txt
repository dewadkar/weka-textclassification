            I bought this car a year and a half ago. I didn't want a SUV, but wanted a luxury toy. I went with the Diamante mainly because Mitsubishi was offering the 0% 60mo financing deal and I didn't want to miss it (hindsight...). I have been nothing but impressed with this thing. 

I used to race cars and honestly, the Diamante's performance is top notch. At first I thought the traction control system was a joke, that is, until I really pushed it in an empty parking garage with 4 passengers. The car's front and back ends went exactly where I put them - it was like a dream, complete control. It's plenty quick enough off the line for any aggressive city driver, though I'll admit it's no sports car in this category (the trany isn't meant for racing). On the highway, however, it really shines. It never seems to run out of power. I've been hot-footing it down the highway at 100 mph and been able to jump it to 120 in a few seconds with ease, and the 130 speedometer top line is definitely misleading. Like I said, I've raced some really great cars, and this machine ranks right up there with BMWs, Audis, Mercs, and Lexus' in terms of speed, control, and power. In fact, I'd say it blows away or matches them all in the control arena with the exception of a few BMW and Audi top models, and would probably beat any Luxus besides the SC, and half the lines of the other three if put to it. 

Besides the toy aspect of this car, it's just wonderful in terms of luxury. The front seats could use a little adjustment, but besides that, it's fantastic. The whole cabin design is brilliant. It's got all the bells and whistles, and it just plain looks good, "tough" as one friend put it. The Infinity stereo is phenomenal for a factory job, and it's ride is virtually silent. So silent, I constantly find myself idling ten feet behind people in parking lots without their even noticing. 

People ask what kind of car I drive and when I tell them they don't know what to think since most don't even know what a Diamante looks like, but the moment they get in they are completely awed and can't believe they've never heard much about the model. It's a jewel hidden in the rough of Mitsubishi's line of autos, and obscured by the overpriced under-performing German lines.
