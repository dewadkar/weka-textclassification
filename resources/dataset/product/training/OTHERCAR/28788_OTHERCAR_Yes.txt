            My husband and I were in the market for a good family vehicle for me to drive, but we didn't have a lot of money to spend on a luxury vehicle.  I still wanted to have a nice car with some decent features, so that put us in a bind - until we found the 1998 Chevy Lumina.  

First of all, when I saw this car sitting in the lot, I wanted it even before driving it or looking inside.  It LOOKED classy and expensive, although it was only around $16,000.  I was so happy to find out it came standard with AM/FM cassette, dual airbags, power steering, power brakes, and automatic doors and windows.

The interior was a nice velvety material (ours was gray).  The front is very spacious, and holds two adults comfortably.  There's lots of leg room on both sides.  In the middle is an armrest/storage area that has a cupholder inside.  The backseat is just as roomy as the front, and can hold three adults.  There's lots of legroom, here as well.  I noticed up front there is another pull-out cup holder near all the controls, so two drinks can travel safely.  

The car drives very well, and I always feel safe in this vehicle.  It's not too large that I feel I'm driving a truck, but it isn't so small I'm intimidated by other cars, either.  I never slip in the snow or rain, and I the steering is so easy and wonderful.  

The controls are all easy to use and self explanatory.  It didn't take me long to figure out where everything was and how to work it.

The trunk is roomy enough to hold my double stroller plus shopping bags and groceries.  That's a godsend since my back seat has two car seats and a four year old!  

The engine is a 6 cylinder, and it offers a lot of pick up!  

The only complaints I have about the 1998 Lumina is there have been some cars in this year and brand that have had transmission troubles.  Ours has not had that problem, but I know of a few that have.

Overall, you get a lot of bang for your buck with the Lumina.
