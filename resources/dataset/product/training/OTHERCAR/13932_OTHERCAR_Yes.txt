            I bought a 1998 Subaru Legacy outback Ltd wagon and so far I love it! It handles well and has a smooth ride.  I love the features this car has, heated seats, CD player, two sunroofs, etc.  I was in a car accident in 1995 and thanks to my well made car, air bag, and seatbelt I walked away from a potentially fatal accident.  I wanted a new car that was safe so that I could feel confident that if I ever was in another accident, I'd walk away again. This car has dual airbags, crumple zones, and side impact beams.  It has been rated one of the safest cars on the road today.  I wasn't all that crazy about the cars looks (I really like the Mustang convertible!!) but I didn't care because I wanted SAFE, and I feel safe and secure in this vehicle and that's what matters.
   So far I have only had one problem where I had to take the car in.  There was a part apparently that was leaking grease, and it would make the car smoke in warmer temperatures.  The grease they put in this part apparently was too loose and had to be changed for a thicker grease.  This had to be done in all of the 98 vehicles, which was a bit of an inconvenience, but now that it's fixed I have not had a problem.  It is running smoothly now!!
  This is also a great car if you have children, it's nice and roomy and seats 5 comfortably.  The station wagon is nice and has a cover that you can pull over the back so you can cover over anything valuable that you may have.
   I highly recommend this vehicle!! Drive safely!!!<br><br>
