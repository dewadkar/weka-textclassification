            My husband and I recently purchased an MPV after searching for the right deal for well over a month and a half.  We already own a Honda Odyssey and were not interested in another vehicle of that size or cost.  But, with a recent addition to our family the mini SUV would now be too small.  We needed something with 3 rows of seats, but not too big.  This is also our second vehicle so we didn't want to spend $35-40K on a big SUV type.  After much research we settled on either the Toyota Sienna or Mazda MPV. We figured we could get the MPV for a better deal and went in that direction.
The MPV comes in DX, LX and EX models.  The low end DX has the same engine as the other two, but does not come with ABS brakes.  Many of the other features/options can be built into the DX.  We purchased a DX with all power options (doors, windows, etc) and seperate rear air.  There are appearently many configurations of this model which seem to change from dealership to dealership.  There were a few dealers offering the DX with a free entertainment package (overhead TV w/VCR), but none of these low low end models had any power options at all. You may have to look around to find the model you want with the specific features you want.  Don't be satisfied if one dealer does not have what you are looking for.  Keep looking around until you do find it.  
I titled this Odyssey JR. because in many ways the MPV is like a mini Honda Odyssey.  The similarities in style and features are remarkable.  The magic rear fold down seat that folds away into a rear well area is here and even improved over the Honda version.  If you are not familiar with this, the rear seat folds backwards toward the rear door and resides into the area behind the seat to create a large flat storage in the rear without having to remove the seat from the vehicle.  The improvements to the seat are in its flexibility.  Not only can you fold it down and away, but you can flip it backwards to create a bench facing out to the back to sit and watch ball games or outdoor movies.  You can also just fold down the top part to create two flat beds which are great for overnight trips with the kids.  
There are also lots of little things that make this van Odysseylike.  The handle on the rear door for easy pull down, the extra cup holders everywhere, the rear heat/cool system, the easy to read dash, the middle row seats.  The middle row seats can be configured as a bench or buckets with one lever and a push.  They can also be very easily removed.  
The engine has performed very well up to now with no repairs or maintenence needed.  It has good pickup, but can be jerky when you really need to step on it.  It has performed well on the highway and gets up to 70 nicely and seems to have even more power.  The ride is smooth and the steering gives you a good feel.  I have felt in complete control of the vehicle at all times.  The one things I have noticed that seems strange is the odometer.  I have a feeling that it is not accurately accumulating mileage and will be keeping a close check on this over time.  
The side doors are not powered and this is not an option.  This is probably my one big disappointment with this vehicle.  You don't realize how much you like the power sliding doors until you don't have them.  That being said the doors open and close very easily.  
I can tell you that we are happy with our MPV for the use it gets and the price we paid for it.  It may compare to the Odyssey, but it really is Jr.
