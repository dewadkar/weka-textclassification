            This is just an update on my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited.

I now have just over 25000km, I still LOVE this SUV. Its power still comes on very strong - especially after the break-in.  However, gas usage is quite high at about 19km/100L or less than 10MPG.  Filling up the tank is really depressing especially with gas prices going up, up, up.

Highway driving is also noisier than a car.  Of course, being an SUV with All Terrain tires don't help.  But very long drives can be tiring.  On the other hand, knowing that I have very good grip with these tires is comforting so the road noise is acceptable.

On the good side, when we got our Big first Snowfall of the season, I was very excited to see how the quadra-drive performs and all in all it was superb.  I went everywhere and anywhere. I tried to mash on both the gas pedal and on the brakes in the knee deep snow and the combination of the quadra-drive and ABS made this SUV completely stable and controllable on both ice and snow.  I even went up a very steep hill that had both snow and ice and it went up without any problems.  My other car (a Subaru Legacy GT AWD) couldn't even make it up that same hill !  Now that is a 4x4 !!

On the bad side, I had to replace both my front Rotors and Brake Pads at about 15000km due to warped rotors.  Although the dealer I purchased the car from replaced them for free as warranty work at 15000km, the problem seems to be coming back and I already have 25000km and the full warranty is over.  I am very surprised that Daimler Chrysler would market such a good SUV with such poorly made parts like their brake rotors.

In any case, if the rotors do warp again at 30000km and the dealer won't replace them for free, I may have to resort to getting after-market rotors and pads from Powerslot and Raybestos - which I was going to do anyway once they were worn out.

Overall, this SUV has only had that one problem (Brakes). Other than that, this is a superb vehicle that I still highly recommend !!
