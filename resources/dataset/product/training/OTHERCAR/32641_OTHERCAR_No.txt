            I bought a used 1997 Sunfire and expected a few problems, but its stylish good looks sold me over.
As I have seen from other reviews, I was one of the lucky ones since the problems started more than 6 months after I bought it. First, the shock absorbers are the worst, even from AC Delco, you "feel" the road as if you were riding a bicycle. I have changed the front and back ones, even all 4 tires. 

Then, there's a rattling noise no dealership has ever found the cure for - it sounds as if coming from behind the car and its felt more from the driver's side than the passenger's. You really have to listen to loud music to ignore all the squeaking and the rattling.

The interior is very delicate, I've since then broken: the rearview mirror, the external mirror (driver's side); the car stereo could not be set to a high level (even medium high) because it started to dim (some strange problem with the car alarm -  a very wise kid fixed this since nobody else had a clue); 3 of the automatic window engines have died on me and they're very expensive; the driver's side sometimes refuses to close so I travel with a screwdriver and have learned to live with this issue.

Other than mentioned, let me tell you, this car suffers from overheating when I'm waiting in traffic or ATMs.
I'm starting to resent the damn thing (my wife already hates its guts) but if I want to sell it (the reselling price is a joke for this model) I have to fix a lot of stuff first. Sometimes I just want to drive it off a bridge (and do a Vin Diesel XXX stunt to survive).

The engine is not all that bad, nice power and so-so gas guzzling (even better than my last car, a Mitsubishi Galant).

Unless you're mechanically oriented (I'm not) or have stocks in a dealership, avoid this car. It's not a nightmare like others I've seen (or heard tales from), but it is a high maintenance vehicle with issues hard to troubleshoot (even by "experts").
