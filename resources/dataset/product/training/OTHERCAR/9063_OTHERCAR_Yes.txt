            There are several different kinds of cars, you have sport cars, luxury cars, minivans, and SUV's.  Personally I am a luxury car type of guy, I loved my audi 100, and am looking at getting a BMW 5 series pretty soon.  But back to this car, if you are into sport cars, this is the one, it is absolutely amazing, the handling, braking, acceleration.  I actually got my first speeding ticket in this car in 6 years :)  You just tend to feel one with this car, it does what you want, when you want and that is a good, and expensive combination if you are not careful.  I had the two door version of the 325 which means that the back was a bit cramped, but hey this is a sports car, not a family car.

The Good:
The interior is well finished and solid, the 5 speed is very very smooth and responsive.  Everything is laid out perfectly around the driver.  The engine is a marvel, it not only looks impressive when showing of to your friends, but it also handles near perfect.  The cars body is very good stiff, and will feel like that even at 200k miles.

The Bad:
Not much to say here, except to remind you that this is a rear wheel drive car, and although it has near perfect handling even in bad weather you should still be careful.  Some bags of salt or sand will help during a snow storm.  This car handles so well that some people might become too confident driving which can be dangerous.  Always keep you attention up no matter how good the car.  During the two years that I had the car I only needed to change the oil, and the windshield washer pump (which was only $35 and was easy enough to install myself in 5 minutes).
