               Back in the mid 1980's, Chrysler-Dodge had a dream of making a fuel economic/sports car. Introducing the Dodge Daytona. Dodge Daytona was put into production from 1984 - 1993 and sold millions until it was changed into the Intrepid. 
   Early 1990, I purchased a white 1990 base model Daytona used with about 97,000 miles. I fell in love with the smooth acceleration of 5 speed with a 125 horsepower 2.5L 4 cylinder engine, there is also an optional 2.2 turbo 4 cylinder by Dodge and 160 horsepower 3.0L 6 cylinder proudly produced by Mitsubishi. I have put in an INFINITI KAPP/JBL/PIONEER sound system with tape/cd player, security system, and sunroof. The only complaint I have with the car is that Dodge's primer does not hold the pain well. If you look at any Chrsyler/Dodge product, particularly the Daytona, Shadow/Aries models from 1987-1991. The last little complaint I do have is the backseat in which I have no IDEA what Dodge engineers were thinking when they made a backseat that is basically nonexistant and could barely hold a tottler. All in all, I now have 108,000 and it has seen the dealer twice for minor repairs and still gets 30+ mpg. If your looking for a quick compact sports car with fuel efficiency, this is your choice. <br><br>
