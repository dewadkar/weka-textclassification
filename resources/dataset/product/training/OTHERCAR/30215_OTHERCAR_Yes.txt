            We purchased the 1991 GMC sonoma 4x4 in 1998 because we were in colorado, and needed the benefit of 4 wheel drive.  I at first, hate to admit, that I could not stand that truck.  I have to say now, that it was one of the best and wisest purchases we have made of late.  It has gotten us through some pretty bad weather and road conditions, and for an older model, she has held up way better than I would have ever thought.  I did not like it at first, because I dont like trucks, and do not like to drive them, as I learned, it just takes a little getting used to.  It is a very comfortable vehicle.  And handles the road nicely.  Like I said, we bought it to get through snow, but it has gotten through alot more.  We have had our share of fun in the mud too.  Being a '91, I was hesitant, given the thought in my head that there was soon to be major repairs, again, I was mistaken.  We have had to, in the 100,000 miles put on her, only had to replace what we have broken through our own play.  It is a good, solid truck, and I would highly recommend it to just about anyone!<br><br>
