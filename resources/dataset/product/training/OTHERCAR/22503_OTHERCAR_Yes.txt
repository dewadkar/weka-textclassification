            This was our second Saturn. We had purchased the lower model wagon (the S series) and I could not fit comfortably in it but that was OK since my wife was going to do most of the driving). We kept running into space issues, not enough room for me to drive comfortably, little back seat space etc., so we decided to go back to the dealer and see what we could do. We took advantage of 0.9% financing and test drove the S-series, what a difference. Of course the dealer wanted us to test drive the 6-cyl model and we did, and it has a lot of power (compared our previous Saturn), but we decided to go with the 4-cyl since power was not really what we were looking for in a wagon. The car is very roomy, I can comfortably drive this car for hours. It has nice features like wood trim and power drivers seat which were standard. The gas mileage is about the same which is great since this car is much bigger than the S-series. The back seats have plenty of room, I sat back there and was amazed at how comfortable I was. Overall we are extremely pleased with our wagon and would suggest you give this wagon a test drive if you're in the market for one.
