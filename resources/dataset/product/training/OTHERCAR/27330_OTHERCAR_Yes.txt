            After owning many vehicles ranging from Volkswagens to Volvos and several in between,I fell in love with the great lines of the Durango at first sight.The final clincher was the test drive. Pleasantly surprised at the smooth easy drivability of the Durango,I had originally thought that it would be far too big and cumbersome for a small person to handle,I was wrong!! With the drivers seat ability to move in many positions it was just like driving a car with much better visibility. The seats front,back and rear I found very comfy especially on long hauls. Getting my 4 year old in and out is easier on my back,as I'm not always bending down to get her in the car seat,she likes to ride she can see everything.Love the back air system and so do my passengers because I like the front very cold,generally much colder than the average person is comfortable with. The sound system is very nice and the Durango gives a very quiet smooth ride.I knew that I wanted a bigger vehicle after my brother in law was killed in an motor vehicle accident,but did not want the tank size of the Ford Expedition or the Lincoln Navigator. The Dodge Durango is a vehicle I feel safe and secure driving,not to mention the numerous heads it turns. I have been parked and people will come right up and ask how I like it,with the answer always being I love it. I knew I wanted a vanity plate,put my order in for &quot;LUV IT&quot; and the plate says it all!  
On the down side..Poor gas mileage,front passenger seat needs more position options.<br><br>
