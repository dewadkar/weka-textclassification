            Throughout the history of Chevy there have been a lot quality cars made, Chevelles, Camaros, Impalas etc.  If you are looking for a car that reaches back to the old days of these vehicles, steer clear of the current Montes.  
     The MC's of the 70's were awesome machines with a long look that would get you noticed by sight and sound.  When the Eighties rolled around the Monte's left something to be desired.  Then Chevy decided that they needed to revitalize their cars (Corvettes just wouldn't cut it anymore) so they introduced the Monte Carlo SS.  Now this was a fine automobile that every 17 year old lusted after.  It had all the luxuries of a modern car while fulfilling the needs of those whose wanted a car with some character.  The Monte SS filled this need.  It had the same engine of the 'Vette of the same year with a back seat that could fit all your buddies in the back seat, and you could afford it!  This writer has always had a deep love for the '87 SS.  I was truly saddened when Chevy discontinued this model.  There was little to not like about them, they were fun to drive, had lots of room, and most of all they were SO cool looking.  They were everything you could want in a modern muscle car.  When the Bowtie brought back the Monte I was ecstatic.  Finally the Monte was getting the recognition that they deserved. 
     When I first saw it I was horrified.  The look was gone.  The 2001 Monte SS is the very example of front-wheel-drive disappointment, with mediocre handling and get-up-and-go.  The interior is wonderful for those of you that need an interior that has all the bells and whistles at your fingertips.  For those of you who yearn for the old musclecar promise of the SS you will be sad to see that the 2001 Monte Carlo will not deliver.  The look will fall short as will the performance.  If you want a reasonable, front-wheel, 4 cylinder, two-door with plush interior, than this is the car for you.  If you are looking for what the old SS's delivered, better keep shopping for an '87 in your color, 'til then, don't forget the muscle!  <br><br>
