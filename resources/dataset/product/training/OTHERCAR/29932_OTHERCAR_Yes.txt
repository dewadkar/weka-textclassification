            Recently Consumers Union released an OPINION on the Mitsubishi Montero Limited.  Of course like any consumer I was initially concerned with their findings, especially because I drive a 2001 Montero Limited, but it's not just me, I usually have my four children in tow.  Their ages range from 10 months to 7 years.
Upon viewing the video of how the Montero went up on two wheels, it became abundantly clear that we as consumers need to depend more on opinions we read on the internet, from real live people with real live experiences.  I mean, really, who drives their SUV like that anyway?  If you drive any SUV like that something bad is bound to happen.  
Well mine is a real-life experience.   I absolutely love my Montero.  Everyday I place my four children in it and every week I drive anywhere from 250-300 miles commuting from work and the sitters.  I am a very aggressive driver and I have never felt uneasy or unsure of what my car could handle.  In the heavy rain I feel perfectly safe and sound.  In the summer heat it is one of the most comfortable places to be.  In fact last summer when I was still pregnant with my baby, I found the car was the only place I could sit comfortably.  We sometimes took long drives just so I could get a nap in.  As for the sun-roof, it is so big, even the people in the back can enjoy the view, especially on night drives.  Altogether the Mitsubishi Montero Limited is a great buy, it's luxurious, sporty practical, and most of all SAFE.  I recommend you head out to your local Mitsubishi dealer and ask to test drive the Montero Limited, but don't be surprised if you drive it all the way home!!
