               Having tried other digital cameras out, I believe that Sony's Cybershot series are far and away some of the best out there.  They range from this model, which is 1.3 mega pixels, all the way up to 3.3 mega pixels.  

   I find myself using the lower resolution settings more often than the larger ones, so I opted for the 1.3mp model.  I find that at 640 x 480 the snapshots are perfect for emailing and just casual picture taking.  They are much more vivid and crisp than other brands' cameras at the same setting.  The highest I tend to go for everyday use is 1064 x 768, I like this setting as the best balance of file size and image quality, and looks good even when printed out on photo paper.  

   Occasionally I will use the highest setting and have these professionaly printed at a photo center, the results are darn near film quality, (and alot less money, I know I'm cheap).  

   Sony also utilizes their infolithium rechargable battery pack, which offers fast recharges and great battery life.  My only gripe is that they only included a 4MB memory stick (Sony's proprietary flash memory medium) with this model.  It allows about 50 images at 640 x 480, 20 images at 1024 x 768, and at the highest resolution,1472 x 1104, wont even fit one picture.  The memory is upgradable however, as Sony sells additional memory sticks in 4MB, 8MB, 16MB, 32MB, and 64MB versions.  Additional Infolithium batteries are also readily available at retailers nationwide.  This camera has a USB interface, and a high quality LCD screen. Five out of Five stars.
