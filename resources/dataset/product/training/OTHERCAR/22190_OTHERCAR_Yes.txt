            I love this Kodak DC 3400 Digital Camera that I recently purchased. It is very easy to operate and has so many great attributes, I do not know where to begin my review! 

First, I'll note that I made the step up to this camera from a Jam Cam digital camera and the difference is remarkable. The Kodak DC 3400 is a great camera for the digital photographer who wants a camera that is easy to use, relatively inexpensive (compared to high end camera that cost $500 and higher) and produces great pictures for printing, emailing or for the webpage. After using this camera I think that I will never go back to a film camera again!!!

The Kodak DC 3400 has a great graphical menu interface that guides you step by step through all the camera features by pushing the up and down buttons according to what you want the camera to do. It's a very easy to operate camera even for this digitally challenged reviwer! 

The monochrome display ont he top of the camera tells you how many pictures are left on your compact flash card, what flash mode you are in, what picture settings you have on, and other settings. The camera settings control dial is easy to set for the specifications you prefer. This is a dial found on the back of the camera that is also used for capture and review of pictures in a slideshow design. The same dial is used at the connect setting when connecting your camera to your computer.

On the bottom of the camera is a small dial that sets the brightness of your pictures. For instance if you just took a picture of your child and find out that it turned out too dark, just turn the brightness dial and wala! your picture brightens up before you print it or download it to the computer. 

I love the 1.8 inch LCD monitor on the back of the camera. With this you can see what the picture will look like before you take it. 

Prints of pictures turn out very well with the Kodak DC 3400 camera up to 8x10 sizes. You can also take your Compact Flash Card to Walmart or other store that has a Kodak Picture Maker Kiosk for printing the best quality photos if you do not have a photographic quality printer at home. There are websites online like Ofoto that will also print your pictures for a small fee. With these you can upload your pictures to them and they will print them off for you.

For your pictures, you can set the quality that you would like them to be. For ebay or emailing pictures, you can set the camera for the standard quality and for printing you can set it for better or best quality depending on the size prints. For a 5x7 print, the Better setting is wonderful. For an 8x10 print, the Best setting is a better setting to use.  

The only negative things that I have found with this camera is that the LCD monitor is placed in a poor position and I keep having to clean off the monitor because my nose smudges it or my fingers smudge it while I'm holding it to snap pictures. Also the batteries get used up pretty quickly so I invested in rechargable batteries and a charger(which I wish they included with the camera). I got a charger and 4 rechargable batteries at Walmart for about $15 though Kodak sells a very nice charger with their own Kodak photo batteries but they are more expensive. I used the regular alkaline batteries when I first got the camera and they lasted for 2 days, which is an indication of the short life they have. Using the LCD monitor uses them up a lot faster than if you don't use the monitor.

Also I purchased an extra Compact Flash Card. The 8 MB card that comes with the camera just seems to small. If it was being used for only emailing pictures or for ebay auctions then 8 MB would be ideal but if you plan to take higher resolution pictures for printing, I suggest investing in a larger Compact Flash Card. 

All in all, this is a wonderful camera! It's not an inexpensive camera but compared to many cameras that are $300 and higher, this is a great camera for the $300  average price. If you look around you can find a great deal on it and save a little more. I bought mine on Ebay and paid under $250.
