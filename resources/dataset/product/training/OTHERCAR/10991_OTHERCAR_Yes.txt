            When you have a family as large as mine it is important to have a reliable car that can get you all around, and with the differences in the ages of all my children it is also important that we have a nice comfortable vehicle especially for our longer family outings.

About a year ago we were able to get a nice used Chevy Astro Van from a trusted family member and I can say with great enthusiasm it is one of the greatest cars we have had.  I am not what one would consider the easiest person on a car.  I have almost no mechanical skills, and I am not known for my faithfulness to general vehicle upkeep, but this car has shown an incredible amount of durability and is a car I would recommend to anyone who has a large family.  

I have done some research, and my van has over 180,000 miles on the original engine.  The transmission is also original.  And yet this van runs like it is brand new.  I have had cars that have stranded my family in the middle of nowhere and it feels great to go on a road trip and to be secure in knowing that I would arrive.

The gas mileage in the van is not great, but neither is it poor, we have not had to curtail any of our activities because of our van during this recent gas crunch. 

Only once in the year that I have owned this car have I had any mechanical difficulties and that was a windshield wiper problem.  Lately I have taken more care of my cars, you know changing the oil frequently and I have noticed an improvement in it's functionability.

When I buy a new van, I will be certainly looking for another similar van.<br><br>
