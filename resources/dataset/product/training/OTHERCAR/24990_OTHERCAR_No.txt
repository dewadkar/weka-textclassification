            I just got back from a business trip and had been driving a brand new Chevy Lumina from Avis.  It had only 1200 miles on it, but it felt like a 5 year old car.  In fact, my colleague who rode with me had the same impression, saying it felt and looked like it had 50,000 miles on it.

The springs in the driver's seat had already sprung and I could feel every coil -- not to mention it provided no support and it felt like I was sitting on a board.  The car was loud and the steering wheel was jerky.  The steering wheel only had two positions -- very high like a truck driver, or very low like a Formula One race car.  Completely uncomfortable.

My business trip was to Seattle, so, of course, it was raining.  The windshield wipers worked fine, but the motor that ran them was loud.  You could hear a high buzz/whine of the motor.

The radio in the car was of very poor quality.  I fooled with the bass/treble, but to no avail.

The car did have some power, and that was nice, but that is the only thing I liked about it.  It handled poorly even though it was powerful.

Thumbs down on the Chevy Lumina.  My 8 year old Volvo 240 is heads and shoulders above this brand new Chevy.  Yuck.<br><br>
