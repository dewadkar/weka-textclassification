             Whoa! And i thought the old jettas were cool way back in the early 90's. I NEVER dreamed VW would come out with a car that has such clean lines, powerful engine and just all around fun car. The new Jetta is just that! The new look is astounding, Well cut, nice colors, alloy rims and about the coolest looking headlightsi have ever seen. 

 This car handles and it has some excellent pick up as well. My roomate just got one and boy am i impressed. After taxes and tags and all that she wound up paying around 23 grand, fully loaded, power everything, v6 with sunroof and i would have to say im looking to get one as well. 

 She let me take it on a test run (bad idea) and i love to drive, I took this car to about every limit i could and it was me who backed down, not the Jetta. The Jetta was there with me every step and seemed to egg me on. 

 A great car to own, VW's from my experience (what my friends tell me) are very reliable, fun cars to drive, add that to the great new look that VW is sporting and you're looking at probably one of the coolest cars to own! (or drive)

 The interior is wonderful as well, plenty of room, 3 headrests in th back, chrome on the center console and a loud stereo make this car great for long road trips! <br><br>
