            If you put on tons of miles, but want to look good doing it, this the car for you.  

I am a Mother of one and I have been driving my 1996 Mazda 626 for a year.  It's sporty, affordable, and sensible.
  
It's a great purchase for the average income family.  Our family could not afford 2 expensive vehicles so we gave up our 1998 Grand Voyager for this car.  I have never regretted it yet.  

I feel safe being in a sedan vehicle and not a compact car.  Our family budget could not afford a Camry.  The Mazda's back seat is spacious.  The handle of this vehicle is wonderful.  I live in the midwest, icy roads are common and the car does well on all types of roads.  The Mazda 626 has saved me and my family hundreds of dollars on gasoline.  The mileage of this vehicle ranges from 30 to 37 miles per gallon. I can guarantee I will drive this vehicle into the ground.  I will get sick of it before it will quit history says so.
The Mazda 626 looks slick in black and I feel like a racing ma in it!! <br><br>
