            I bought the Pontiac Grand Am from the second owner. The mechanic did a serious check-up and found nothing wrong. We decide to change the spark plugs and transmission oil and preventive measures in addition to changing the oil.

After that, I had no problems with the car. It rides well, smoothly and give me a comfortable feeling about taking it for a long ride. 

I have driven the car for about six months and had no mechanical problems with it. I find the car spacious both in front and back seats. The windshield provides excellent visibility. While the mechanic informed me about the problems reported about some of the Pontiacs equipped with the Quad engine, I have not had this experience. The car has 85,500 miles and I have a feeling it is going to last me a long time.

I would strongly recommend this type of car to those interested in a sporty looking car, with comfortable seats, virtually maintenance-free, and a responsive car.
