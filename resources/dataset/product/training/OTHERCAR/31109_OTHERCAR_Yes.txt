            I purchased my Blue Jeep Cherokee Sport in July of 1997 for a few reasons.  First, I got a great deal, $1250 off the dealer invoice - so I ended up paying under $20,000 for the vehicle.  Second, I really like to camp and this SUV gives me the room to carry all my camping stuff.

I love it because it has never done me wrong in the 3 years that I have owned it.  It gets between 14 and 17 MPG and is a bit loud - but those are the only bad things I have to say about it.

I feel like I am on top of the world when I drive this powerful beast.  I recommend it to all who look for power and affordability in the SUV marketplace.

WARNING - at 30,000 miles my Jeep's check engine light came on and the dealer could not figure out why.  It cost nearly $600 for them to get it off.  GUH.<br><br>
