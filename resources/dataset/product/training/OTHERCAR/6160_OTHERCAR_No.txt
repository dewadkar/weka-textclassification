            As much as I hate to admit it, my wife and I have been driving mini-vans for 15-years now. We had no intentions of becoming seasoned mini-van owners - it just happened. We have four children who make owning a mini-van a necessity for us. We owned a 1984 Dodge Caravan and a 1994 Ford Aerostar before buying our 1999 Chevrolet Venture. As you can see, we don't have a favorite make or model. Trust me when I say that this is an honest, unbiased epinion based on our many years of mini-van experience.

I was leaving my office for lunch one day in early 2000 when I spotted my wife across the street blowing the horn in a 1999 Chevrolet Venture. She had been test driving it and wanted me to do the same. I could tell that she wanted me to like it. Before I knew it, we were the proud owners of our third mini-van - a white 1999 Chevrolet Venture. We bought the Venture because my wife liked the styling as much as liked its power, smooth ride, and handling.

WHAT WE LIKE:
Our Venture is a joy to drive. It rides and handles nearly as good as a mid-size car. In fact, I sometimes forget that I&#146m driving a mini-van. The seats are very comfortable on long trips. A sliding door on both sides makes it easier and faster for the kids to get in and out. The 3.4L V-6 engine makes a surprising amount of power while providing average fuel economy. The Venture&#146s large gas tank allows us to drive for several hours before having to refuel. I don&#146t know exactly how many hours or miles I can drive before refueling because at least one of our four kids always needs to stop before the Venture does! The Venture&#146s front-wheel drive provides adequate traction when the roads are covered with snow and ice.

WHAT WE DON'T LIKE:
Although the dual sliding doors make it easy to access the center row seats, our Venture&#146s seating configuration (7-bucket seats in a 2 3 2 arrangement) makes it cumbersome to get in and out of the third row seats. The center row has 3-bucket seats running the entire width of the van. This makes it very difficult for the third row passengers to get around the center seats. This problem is aggravated by the fact that the sliding doors don&#146t open far enough to permit third row passengers direct access to their seats. We have to fold a center row seat down and/or move it forward just like you would fold and/or move a front seat in a small 2-door coupe.

Our biggest dislike is our Venture's extensive service history. It has been to the Chevrolet dealer far too often considering that it&#146s less than 3-years old with 48,000 miles on the odometer. The following is a summary to give you an idea of what I&#146m talking about:

Problem #1 &#150 1,000 miles (original owners): The engine stalled without warning and would not restart. This intermittent problem lasted another 10,000 miles while the Service Dept. tried to correct it by replacing the theft-deterrent computer and the engine control computer. It was finally resolved when a technician repaired a loose connection in a wiring harness. Cost = $0 under warranty. This problem aggravated the original owners to the point that they traded it only months after it was purchased new. 

Problem #2 &#150 28,000 miles: The driver&#146s side window always went up and down very slowly. Now, it wouldn&#146t go up and down at all. The electric window motor regulator was replaced. Cost = $0 under warranty.
 
Problem #3 &#150 35,000 miles: I told the Service Dept. that the brakes weren&#146t as tight as they were when we got the van. The technician checked the brakes and reported no problem found. The technician noted that he added brake fluid to top-off the reservoir. He added that it was not down to the Low Fluid line to begin with. Cost = $45 for brake fluid and labor (routine maintenance of fluids isn&#146t covered by warranty). I argued that the brake fluid wasn't necessary and the brakes were still too soft. Finally, I paid the bill.

Problem #4 &#150 38,000 miles: The engine cranked, but would not start. We were afraid that Problem #1 was back! The technician replaced a burnt pin that was loose in an electrical connector near the fuel pump. This may be a common problem because the Service Dept. was on the phone with the owner of a Pontiac Montana (the Venture&#146s cousin) to give him the same bad news. Cost = $225 for towing, parts, and labor. The 36-month / 36,000 miles warranty did not cover parts and labor because we had 38,000 miles.

Problem #5 &#150 48,000 miles: The brakes continued to get softer even after I reported it (Problem #3) at 35,000 miles. Then, at 48,000 miles, the brakes suddenly stopped working without any warning lights! MY WIFE HAD TO CHANGE LANES INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC TO AVOID REAR-ENDING ANOTHER CAR THAT WAS TURNING RIGHT!!! The technician replaced the master cylinder and noted that it looked as though someone added contaminated brake fluid in the past. I was furious because I never added brake fluid! Besides, I told them the brakes weren&#146t right 13,000 miles ago when I paid THEM to add brake fluid!!! Cost = $0 because I REFUSED TO PAY. I said it better be under warranty because I reported brake problems at 35,000 miles. The Service Manager agreed.

Problem #6 &#150 51,000 miles: The driver&#146s side window is once again going up and down very slowly just like it did before it quit working (Problem #2) last time.

Problem #7 - 54,000 miles: The original Delco battery was dead whenever the van was parked for three days or longer. I've had cheap replacement batteries last longer than this one (less than 3-years)! Although I figured it was the battery, I paid to have the entire electrical system and battery tested. Cost = $86 for tests, battery, and labor. 

Overall, I would NOT recommend the 1999 Chevrolet Venture due to the maintenance problems that we&#146ve experienced. It's obvious that we aren't the only owners unhappy with our 1999 Venture because it made the 2002 Consumer Reports 'Cars To Avoid' or NOT RECOMMENDED list.

LAST WORDS: Try overlooking the aggravation, inconvenience, and costs associated with numerous maintenance problems and concentrate solely on the purchase price vs. trade-in value. Now brace yourself for another disappointment. The original owner paid $24,900 new for our (now 3-years old) 1999 Venture LS. We recently traded it in with 55,500 miles and received just $9,700 for it. This was the best offer from five different dealerships! A comparably equipped Honda Odyssey LX would have cost the same $24,900 price new and would have been worth $15,200 as a trade-in! Imagine, fewer problems and $5,500 more trade-in value... you guessed it... WE'RE NOW DRIVING A 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY AND LOVE IT!!!
