            After getting rid of my babies, my 85 Chevrolet Cavalier, and my 88 Pontiac Sunbird, I knew it was time for a change.  So I decided to do some research and found out that the best car available to suit my needs would be the 1997 Chevrolet Malibu.

I now currently own a 1997 chevrolet Malibu, and I must say that it is a great car that gives me a smooth ride.  This particular car has been with me for the past three years, and I am proud to say that it has not faltered once.  It was not even funny how many times, I would be on the highway and the 85 Chevy Cavalier that I would be driving would start coughing and I would be stuck on the freeway waiting for a tow truck.  So I got rid of them.  The Pontiac Sunbird's engine was horrible; kept failing on me.

The 97 Chevrolet Malibu has a roomy interior that allows of space for a family of five.  The slightly extended trunk allows room to store oblong objects, such as strollers, wheelchairs, golf clubs, and other large objects.  However, don't let all this talk of family spoil the younger drivers! :)  This machine has plenty of kick, and can easily drive up the slipperiest hills in the winter.  Also, the factory has installed a sound system that packs quite a punch, and the grooves can be heard clearly from a great distance.  All in all, it's a 5 star machine which I got for a price tag of $13,999 (what a deal!)<br><br>
