            Acura is known from honda,so you know what it can do. Its better than a honda accord. They have good looking colors for the car. I really love the navigation system is equips in the car for its  price, you can't get a better deal than that. The navigation is for when your going somewhere and don't know where you are going. Like going to a restaurant or even an old relative that you don't know where they live and want to scare or shock them. It has a v-6 225 horses under the hood now that's got some power for your money and for under $30,000. I like the gears because you can do like a auto stick or turn it back to regular automatic. The ride is quiet and comforting the whole way. A good car for the average family. You will like the heating system it has and the air it pumps out for those hot days. A single person would like this car or an average family will on those long rides. There is nothing you can do without this car its like driving a mercedes c class. Good traction control for rainy days, Good bucket seats. Other cars you might consider beside this is the Lexus es 300, Toyota Avalon, Nissan maxima and they all have v-6's
