            The Toyota Corolla may not be as flashy as Toyota Camry and others in this or near category.  But it sure lives up to the company's high standards of quality, durability, and value. Who does not want to have more money in the bank or stock market instead of wasting it on the tank?  If a family wants comfort, practicality, and savings, Toyota Corolla 2001 is the way to go. 

<b>None other than a &quot;98 Corolla:  An epitaph</b>

Since my wife's and kids' accident in an all-loaded 1998 Toyota Corolla at the beginning of this month, I have grown more attached to this work horse of America.  How many compact vehicles can withstand the driver's side collision with a Chevrolet Malibu? Thanks to God, my family's guardian angel, and the technology with which the &quot;98 Corolla is equipped, my wife and children are here with me today.  The passers-by could not believe that there would be any survivors in this Toyota.  Not only did the Malibu driven by an old taxi driver hit my wife's car on the side, it sent it into a double spin which landed it on the sidewalk and smashed twice against a wall.  It is the same driver's side where my son was also seating in his car seat!  When I got to the scene, it was a such a mess!  Once I saw everybody was alive, I took a deep breath and got onto the waiting ambulance to comfort everybody.  With the blood gushing down my son's forehead, I had no time to ask questions other than to apply pressure until the ambulance professionals could reach him.  All the while, my wife was complaining of pain.  I still did not know that my son's femur was cracked!  The deployment of the side airbag and the car seat may have saved my wife's and son's lives if one looks at the smashing of the driver's side.<b>They are my true SURVIVORS this Summer!</b>

<b>Do you now understand why my wife loves Toyota Corolla?</b>

In fact, amidst all the phone calls dealing with insurance, surgeons, pharmacists, friends, family members, and well-wishers, we kept praising the reliability of the Toyota Corolla (1998 Corolla).  It is something that all of these people end up getting somewhat of a sales pitch in the midst of our sorrows and pain.  This is where marketing tells you to sell the idea of the product!  &quot;As soon as I can walk out of the home or sit enough to research on the computer, I will look for a new Corolla,&quot; my wife said, holding our son wearing a hard cast.  I hate this cast that prevents him from walking with me and playing like before!  I can't wait for him to get out of it!

<b>The New Search For A New Toyota</b>

If researching and buying a new car can be time-consuming, doing so when you are sick is even more horrible and threatening at the same time!  Well, in our case, we had to go check a few dealerships with our children.  Parents, make arrangements to leave your young kids who will not get anything out of the whole experience any way with a relative.  We became wiser on our third trip.  We left them with a relative for a couple of hours.  (If your children's are older, get them involved!)

<i>What's hot about 2001 Toyota Corolla?</i>

Three models are available:  VE ($12,418); CE ($13,108); LE ($15,068).  One thing you will find out is that all of the Corollas are four-door sedans powered by a 1.8 liter four-cylinder engine.  Depending on your comfort, you can choose to test drive the five-speed manual gearbox Corolla.  But, with two kids in tow, we were looking for a four-speed automatic LE with side airbags.  Keep in mind that the following are options that are available:  of course, side air bags, anti-lock brakes (CE/LE) and a sunroof (LE only).  The all-weather guard package offers rear seating area ducts, heavy duty rear window defogger starter and heater. <i>If you have an all-loaded &quot;1998 Toyota Corolla, you may want to keep it.  The 2001 LE is not that different, especially if it comes without the options.  If you want something new, then it's up to you!</i>
