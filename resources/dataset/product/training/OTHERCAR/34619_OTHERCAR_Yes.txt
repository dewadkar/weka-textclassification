                 I would like to highly recommend this vehicle as I am the proud owner of my second one.  
     It is very important for me, a working woman, to have a vehicle that I can depend on as I live in the country and travel to work a lot during the night.  I also needed a vehicle that I could depend on in no matter what type of weather conditions there is, as I live in the state of Maine that is well known for the saying, &quot;If you do not like the weather, wait a minute and it will change!&quot;   I hated it when I use to go to work and it would start to snow and I still had ten more hours to work.  My stomach would get sick and I would worry all of the day, then on the way home, my heart would be in my throat.  Not any more!!!
     Not only is the Sedan a beautiful and sleek looking vehicle, it is also very roomy and comfortable.  I really enjoy seeing the looks on peoples faces when they see my Subaru and I am always getting compliments.  I love the power under the hood!  It still amazes me what power this four cylinder has, and no hesitations.  And the handling in all kinds of weather is a breeze.  I have never had this car fail to start for me no matter how cold the mornings are.
     Of course all Loves has a hate.  There is only two things that I hate but don't really mind.  Being an all wheel drive, if you buy one new tire, you buy four.  And the gas mileage is better in a vehicle that is not AWD.  These are the only hates I have!
     This vehicle is for the person who worries about driving in the weathers.  This vehicle is for the person who likes power in their hands and the feel of a car under them instead of a piece of tin.  This vehicle is for the person who likes to have a dependable car! (of course you have to give your Subaru its routine maint.)<br><br>
