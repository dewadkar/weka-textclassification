             I bought Sony mavica FD85, because I was very happy with its predecessor FD81.

But to my disappointment after taking about 10 pictures with fd85 I realize some pictures are pinkish on the camera's LCD. I check them on the computer monitor and got the same result. This was a major set back to me. 

I am now trying to find a new unit of fd81 as it was perfect for my purpose which was loading the picture on the web site. And I will try to return the FD85 back to store. But the problem is the old model Fd81 has been discontinued and so farI have not been able to locate it.<br><br>
