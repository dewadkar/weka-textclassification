            Ladies and gentlemen of epinions, I have been the proud owner of a 2000 Oldsmobile Alero for about 6 months. It was bought with 20, 000 km's on it and I have since put 6,000 km's on it and it still rides like new.  it is sexy and sporty yet has enough room to store 4 pieces of luggage in the trunk and 4 regular sized adults in the car.  I would reccommend this puppy to anyone who wants a mid-sized sedan with some zip and sex appeal.

THE RIDE:

I have the v6 which makes all the difference in the world.  It gives the car some kick and allows for easy passing plays on the highway or freeway as the case may be. The car hugs the rode nicely and absorbs bumps well yet you can still feel the road.

THE LOOK:

this is a sexy car with a fin on the back and sunroof you can't go wrong.  I se alot of them on the street and people seem to like the sleek, aerodynamic shape.  This car is a  winner.

THE FEATURES:

This is a well equipped car for the price you get much more car than one would in the import counterparts.  Mine was the second from the top with plush bucket seating, am/fm radio & CD player, air and cruise all included. The interior is well layed out and easy to access most features . There is plenty of storage space for CD's , sunglasses, papers and slurpees(2 cup holders).

OVERALL:

This is a fuel efficient car which gets you from point a to b with style an flash.  I know there is the honda civic which seems to lead this class of cars but the Alero can go toe to toe with it better than most of those chumps who faught Iron Mike Tyson in hi heyday!! Give the Alero a try, you won't be dissapointed.  I know that the car is only a year old so will see how it holds up!! So far,knock on wood, so good!!
