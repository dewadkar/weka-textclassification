            Yes, I will add my voice to those who couldn't believe they got a minivan, but now I love the room I have!  I also like that I can get the boys out of their car seats and get ready to go while I'm still in the van - in case of rain, etc.  We tried out the Mazda - not enough power, tried out the Toyota - better, but too many dealer add-ons, was only allowed to sit in a Honda that was already sold, but we knew we liked it and put down a deposit.  Waited a month for delivery - luckily they were getting in just what we wanted.  Opted for the LX - we had read about the sliding door complaints, but we didn't have a minivan and thus no power sliding doors before, so didn't figure we would miss it anyway.  Couldn't believe all the junk Toyota added on before it ever got to the dealer lot - pinstripes for goodness sakes!  Like it's not going to look like a minivan if you put pinstripes on it?!

I love the flip-up tray between the driver and passenger seats - great for the drive through, but goes out of the way when you're parked.  Double A/C came standard - a necessity in Texas.  A friend who got a Toyota complained about the price of Odyssey and expensive options - we put a 6-disc in-dash changer in ourselves we bought online for a few hundred - it even has a Honda logo on it.  The Odyssey handles great, it drives like a car, not a truck.  A recent road trip saw 25 mpg.

As others have said, the gear lever slightly blocks the radio when in drive - maybe if Honda makes it just a little shorter in the future it won't be a problem.  Some of the controls seem a little out of reach at first, but I soon got used to them.  None of the vans we drove had terribly great seats - maybe I'll get a massaging pad for our next road trip.  The interior doesn't pack any punch, but it's a minivan - maybe we'll get wood grain covers?

UPDATE 1/2/02:
Now that we've had the van for a few months and had the opportunity to do some of the maintenance on it and research aspects of future mainenance, I think a real sore spot is showing through, and it's a big one.  Quite frankley I'm surprised it hasn't been mentioned yet.  To summarize...Hello!?!?!  Honda?!?!?  Ever hear of maintainability engineering?  I don't know if this is typical of Honda or just the Odyssey, but this vehical is going to be a real pain to do just about anything on.

What makes this especially painful is the Odyssey requires significantly more maintenance than any other car I've ever owned.  The frequency being about twice as often (3 mo/3750 vs. 6 mo/6000) since I now rank in the "severe" catagory due to a list of exceptions to the normal schedule almost a page long.  I'm left wondering why they even bother with a normal schedule.  There are also items listed that I've never had to do on other cars.

OK, so what's so bad other than the quantity?  The clever engineering employed to place maintenance items in distant, inaccessable, out of the way locations.  My first oil change was an hour long nightmare because I couldn't even find the drain plug (it's nicely wedged about three inches above the narrow opening between the frame and exhaust leaving minimal room to swing your ratchet).  You can't get an oil bottle anywhere near the fill hole either.  To change the cabin air filter requires removal of the glove box and appears to require contortions of the hand that would make Hudini green with envy.  Changing belts requires an engine mount be removed (fortunately that isn't needed too often).

Bottom line, still love the van, but I cringe at the thought of much of the upcomming scheduled maintenance.  If you're a do-it-yourselfer be prepared for hours of frustration on even seemingly small items.  If you are a bring it in type, you may find yourself enquiring about the dealer's interest free payment plan.
