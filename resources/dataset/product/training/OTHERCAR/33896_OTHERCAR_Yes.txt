            Recently, I have test driven the 2004 Subaru Forester XT. I am going to give you all the information I can, that I gathered from the test drive. 
       Handling. The handling in this car is unbeatable for its price, with the exception of the WRX sedan, and the STi sedan. Taking corners at high speed was not an issue, and it had more than enough grip on wet, slick roads to give you more than enough traction to inspire confidence, and comfortability. The steering wheel, although not a Momo, was very comfortable, and was pleasing to the hands.
         Performance. The car is turbo-charged. It has more than enough get-up to throw you back into your seat. It sounds just like the WRX sedan too! For a little 4 cylinder motor, it sure does sing. If you do decide to floor the Forester XT, make sure that its pointed straight, and that no one is in front of you. The acceleration on this car is breah-taking, in the most literall sense of the word. It makes the car very fun to drive, and as far as competition goes, well.. there is no competition in its class, to find numbers that are similair, you best start looking at BMW sedan's. This car not only keeps up with all of the BMW sedan's (with the exception of the M series), but it also is quicker to 60 than all of them. Car and Driver magazine measured an astounding 0-60 time of just 5.3 seconds. This car moves.
          Features. The turbo-charged Foresters all have a large amount of features, from heated seats, to in dash CD changer. If done through Subaru.com, you can even upgrade your sound-system to have a sub-woofer. The test car did indeed have one, and it sounded great. The sound-system isn't a distraction to you, or other drivers. It has wonderful balance that makes it pleasing to listen too. There isn't an over-abundance of bass there to annoy you, and its not cool despite what most teen-agers think.  Depending on how your car is configured, it can have a plush leather interior, along with chrome everything.
          Looks. As far as looks go. It's a toss up. Some love it, some hate it, others are indifferent. The hood-scoop although looks over-sized, is used. It isn't so much for show, as it actually is part of the turbo system.
