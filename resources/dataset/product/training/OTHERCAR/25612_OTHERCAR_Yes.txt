            If you're looking for a car with a lot of power, great performance and value, look no further than the Saab 9-3!!! I have been driving this car for about a year and a half and have nothing to report but tremendous pleasure. This car which is very well equipped and comes in at under thirty thousand dollars is well worth a stop at your local dealership. The standard HOT engine, provides a monstrous turbo charge with the slightest touch of the gas pedal. First gear gets a nice boost and the passing power in this car is unbelievable. I have blown away many a six or eight cylinder car in the forty to seventy mile an hour range. With just four cylinders, this car is a beast.  The brakes are also amazing and impressively beat out a Porsche 911 when coming down from 100 miles per hour. I have had the opportunity to test it out in this test and it really performed well. the inside is very nice and the leather seats are very comfortable. the seat warmers get nice and warm quite quickly. i have zero complaints, nothing has gone wrong, everything is perfect. this car is underrated and should definitely be checked out.<br><br>
