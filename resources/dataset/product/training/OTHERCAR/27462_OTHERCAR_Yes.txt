<TEXT>
            I have a 1994 Dodge Neon sport. I am the original owner and have over 108,000 miles on it. I get 32 mpg city and up-to 42 MPG highway. I have topped 120 miles an hour with the AC on full going up hill, and have driven the car in motocross.

The one thing I have to say about the Neon is that this is the least expensive roadster you will ever fall in love with. If you are looking for a cheap sedan, economical commuter car, or a second car you will put friends or kids into, you have the wrong car. If you are looking for a sporty American roadster that wants no more than to stretch its legs on a country highway.. and not stop at every gas station.. this is your car.

Positives: You can feel the road, you are a part of the car as a driver. Quick off the line and very responsive to the accelerator. Steering and handling is very tight. Great gas millage. Great breaking.

Against: Not a passenger car. Wind through window seals. Too light for ice or snow driving.
