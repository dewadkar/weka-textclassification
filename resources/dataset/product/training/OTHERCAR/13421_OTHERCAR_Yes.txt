               When I became pregnant for the first time at age 37, hubby and I decided we needed a &quot;family friendly&quot; vehicle.  Getting rid of the Corvette was tough...and getting rid of the Jeep was unheard of because we lived in the country, down a long lane that filled with snow whenever the wind blew in the winter...so...the Corvette found a new home much to hubby's dismay and the Jeep stayed around for the hub to drive.  We decided that 4-wheel-drive was a must-have, the new vehicle could not be a FORD (my choice), that it had to be child seat friendly, and have lots of room for hauling baby supplies...we also were looking for reasonably priced and sporty looking and if used, low miles.  We found our 1996 Blazer (this was in 1997) on a car lot with 13K miles on the odometer.  It had power everything, automatic transmission, 4 doors and all the things we HAD to have, and of course, air conditioning :c) and was a bargain at $20K.  This has been the best vehicle I could imagine for a family of three.  With a roomy rear compartment, there is ample storage space, the split, folding, rear seat allows hauling of long objects while still allowing the child safety seat to remain in position, shoulder harness safety belts allow for snug installation of the child safety seat and the child safety locks and locking power windows keep the little one where she needs to be (inside the car) during travel.
   My only real complaint with this vehicle is that when travelling long distances, the back seat isn't very comfortable for a full size, full figured adult person (leg room is at a minimum when the front seat is positioned all the way back) and trying to carry 4 adults and a child is difficult, at best.  I do recommend this vehicle for a family of three or even four people, when two of them are under age 12 (or adult size).  
   This vehicle has been dependable for the most part, but has had at least two recalls for factory defects that needed correcting--one was the ABS system for reprogramming and the other was a motor that powered the windshield wipers--(which I am glad that Chevrolet has caught, but is always a pain to schedule having completed).<br><br>
