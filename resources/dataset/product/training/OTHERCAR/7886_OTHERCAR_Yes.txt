            BACKGROUND
I'm a web designer, I often use photos for websites and am sick and tired of having to pay for stock photography that is way too expensive. I decided a digital camera would be a great investment.

REQUIREMENTS
My journey of investigating cameras in the 500-700 dollar (Canadian funds) range took me through several choices, all of which, at the time, I thought were the best choice, until I did more research.  

Here were my requirements in order of most importance to least: 
-Under 600 (canadian)
-good picture quality
-at least 2.2 MP
-some flexibility with the features (exposure, white balance, flash, there is no manual focus in this price range...)
-no movie feature

That last one may seem strange, but I would never use a movie feature, so why pay for extra guts?

RESEARCH
I spent about a month researching from mainly these sites:

FINDINGS
Before I started my research I really liked the Kodak DX series cameras for their sleek style.  Then I found out it was point and shoot and that was it, no extra features

Then I leaned toward the Sony cameras, but didn't like the proprietary Lithium batteries (they are getting out of that with current models i hear...)

My runner up was the FujiFilm 2600 Zoom and it was tough to turn my cheek to the sweet package they put together.  They put in a 16mb card and rechargables for $500 CDN

My favourite was the Canon A20, but it was getting up there in price ($550 CDN)
The research was clear that Canon has the best quality pics, and since the model has been out for a year with the critics not saying too many bad things about it, I knew it was the best.  Also, the A20 comes with some manual features such as the flash settings, exposure, and white balance settings.

The only thing holding my back was the package, I mean you are literally paying for the camera and manual.  You have to add-in an extra hundred for a half-decent card, rechargables and case, CASE?... come on guys couldn't you throw in a damn case? the print is so bold and clear throughout the manual, "don't drop, be careful, fragile", geez the least you could do is throw in a good case for it.

But in the end, I knew the A40 was replacing it, and so the A20's needed to go and I got a deal.  In case you're wondering why I didn't want the A40, it has movie feature, extra guts...

OUT OF THE BOX
being that I'm not a technophobe, but still, I have never used a digital camera before, I had this camera set up, snapping pics and uploaded to my computer and my website in an hour. no fiddling required.

I killed off the alkaline batteries provided in about 5 hours and bought some Energizer NiMH Rechargables.  

PROVING CRITICS WRONG
I'll tell ya, the bad stuff I read about this camera is wrong, bad battery life, slow pic-pic shooting... bah...
I put in my rechargables in 3 days ago and I can't kill the damn things no matter what I do, I need to kill em' off so the batteries go dead according to the manual, but they are too good, I have had these batteries in for about 14 hours (that is with LCD on and doing as much fooling around as possible)
The camera is very responsive and there is never delays, the little busy sign comes up and down so fast it took me a while to figure out what it said.

Also, the critics complained about the controls of having to fuss with them to get your settings right, not true, most things like setting timer, macro, flash setting, is a one click process.  Setting exposure and white balance is a 2-3 click process, but not a big deal.

CONCLUSION
This camera lived up to its street credentials and more.  Battery life (on rechargables) surprised me.  The number of quality pics you can get on an 8mb card also impressed me (45 pics at 640x480 res at "fine").

Again the only thing that is depressing is the lack of box stuff Canon puts with the camera...Got a case at Zellers, and still need to buy a better card, and I don't think I'll bother with an adapter since the batteries will do fine.

IF YOU CAN STILL FIND THIS CAMERA, GET ONE, IF NOT GET THE A40.
