            I have a 2002 Toyota Tundra V8 SR5 V8 4WD Access Cab truck that I bought brand new in October 2001.  So far, I'm very pleased with the truck.  Being a Toyota fanatic, the Toyota dealer is the first place I looked.  I test drove a Tacoma and a Tundra, needless to say I drove out in a Tundra.  Here's why...

The first and foremost reason was the powerful V8 engine, which by the seat of the pants handed the Taco's V6 it's butt.  Speaking of butts, the seats are very comfortable to sit in (I got the split bench) and the ride is very smooth no matter the road condition.  Even the back seat is comfortable, despite it being a tight space back there (does make an excellent storage area, though).  It's very pleasing inside as well.  The materials used on the seats and dash are nice to the touch, and after 11K miles are squeak and rattle free.  The stereo is very good for a stock unit, with good bass, but the reception can be better.  It also has a CD player, but I don't have many CDs to listen to.
The only cons I can think of are the mileage (which has creeped up from 15 just after break in to around 18 now at 11K), and my choice of paint color, which was black, is hard to keep clean (looks awesome when clean, though).  The black color also takes in alot of heat to the interior so it's very hot after sitting in the sun or on a very hot day.
Other than those minor complaints, I can say without a doubt that the Tundra is the best full-sized truck made today.  Best decision I have ever made!
