            Of all the cars I test drove, and I looked for 4 full months, this car won my heart the first time I shifted from first to second and stomped on it!  The ride is so smooth, quiet, and luxurious that on the highway you are just as comfortable after six hours as on a 15 minute trip.  But, after you exit the highway and get on those mountain passes, stick it in 3rd gear and gun it.  You won't be disappointed.

Toyota designed this car to be flexible to the drivers wants and needs (with some extra money, that is).  With available ground effects, 17&quot; wheels, sport suspension (which lowers the car a full 1.2 inches) and vastly improves the handling but sacrifices the smooth ride.  TRD is also releasing a supercharger that is rumored to boost the car to 250+ hp and 270+ lbs/ft of torque!!  TRD shows off their Solara at many big car shows and as the pace car at some races.  It is sooo sweet!

The main reason I bought this car was because it had a 200 hp V6 with a five speed manual transmission.  No other 'quality' car in its price range can claim that.  I never learned to drive an automatic and find them annoying at best.

My car rolled 12,000 miles on the way home from work tonight and I have not had a single mechanical/functional problem with it yet.

What did Toyota do right:
1) Available 5 speed with the V6, of course :)
2) Comfortable yet fast and nimble, stylish but not outlandish.
3) In-dash CD and tape player
4) Many, many standard options, but the consumer can still choose whether or not to get the more costly ones.
5) Available side airbags
6) High quality leather interior
7) The oil filter is in a very convenient place which makes at home maintenance a snap.
8) Overall it is a very fun car to drive.

What did Toyota miss:
1) The remote trunk release is missing (but available on some models as an after market add-on).  Be sure to find out if the alarm your getting has one available - especially if you had one on a past car and liked it.
2) Memory return on the power driver seat.  To slide the seat forward you have to hold the lever forward for several seconds and then hold it the other way to slide it back.  The process is too time consuming.  It is a good thing I hardly use the back seat.
3) They skimped on the the power passenger seat.  In other words, it is a manual seat with no option [that I am aware of] to make it power.
4) The new 2000 model does NOT come with a full size alloy spare (but my 1999 did).  Shame on you, Toyota.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely!<br><br>
