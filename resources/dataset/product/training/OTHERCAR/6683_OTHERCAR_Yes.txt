            We recently bought the 2000 Volvo C70 and have found it to be everything we read about and more.   We looked at a number of convertibles and chose the Volvo for three reasons: safety, room, looks.   The C70 carries on the Volvo safety tradition with a large number of safety items like the pop up roll bars and the steel reinforcement in the body.   Side airbags are also standard.   Second, I am 6'5&quot; and the C70 is one of the few convertibles I can drive where my head does not stick up above the windshield.   Additionally, there is plenty of room in the back for adults, more than any other convertible we looked at.   As with a number of their new cars, this model is a significant departure from the &quot;boxy&quot; Volvo look, and they did a great job.   The car rides very smooth, is very quiet at 70 - 75mph, and the radio is one of the best I have heard.

No real downside to this car that we have seen.   We have the Low pressure turbo and it has more than enough pickup for any type of driving.  The model we bought has the trip computer, all leather, and the upgraded radio.  

The ride in this car reminds me a little of the lexus, it feels heavy (which we like), yet handles very well.   We give this our highest recommendation.<br><br>
