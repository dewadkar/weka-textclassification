            I just returned from a 3-day, 900 mile business road trip.  Instead of driving my personal car, we decided that it would be cheaper and less risky to just rent a car.  The mileage would have been ~$300, while rental was just over $150.  And while I've never had any mechanical problems to speak of with my car, it is pushing 100,000 miles, not to mention that it currently has an expired tag.  *oops*

My rental was a brand new Grand Prix GT.  I'm actually not sure if it was a 2000 or a 2001, but it was just tagged last month and only had 3,000 miles on it.  The first thing I noticed was how roomy the interior was.  The seat had been moved almost all the way back incase I was tall, and there was still plenty of leg room in the back seat.  I got in and adjusted the seat, and noticed how comfortable it was.  I was glad, because with all the driving I had ahead of me I wouldn't be able to stand uncomfortable seats.

The Grand Prix certainly wasn't short on power, either.  Acceleration was very nice...and it rode well, too.  Initial impression: nice car, good ride, should be bearable.  But I quickly realized that below the surface, this car was <i>extremely</i> annoying, and not the type of car I would want to drive on a daily basis.

<b>Turn signal/windshield wiper control</b>:  The turn signal bar was so far back on the steering column that I actually had to remove my hand from the wheel to turn it on.  I don't like this - I like to keep both hands on the wheel.  Also, in order to activate the windshield washer, I had to turn the bottom half of the signal bar.  Again, I had to remove my hand from the wheel to use it.  I found it very awkward to reach...it was almost easier to reach through the steering wheel to get at it.  Visions of having a wreck during this process and the air bag breaking my arm were hard to shake...and I decided that I'd better not attempt to wash the windshield while driving.

<b>Power door locks</b>:  The first time I pressed the button to lock the doors, I was surprised when I was greeted with three quick &quot;dings&quot;, and the doors did not lock.  I pressed the button again, and this time they locked.  Thinking that I might not have pushed it hard enough or something, I made sure the key was out of the ignition, unlocked them and tried it again.  Same results.

I find this &quot;feature&quot; very annoying, not to mention a bit insulting.  I suppose if you are prone to locking your keys in your car, or if you have children that are prone to locking the doors without your knowledge, you would like this feature.  I, however, do not appreciate having to &quot;confirm&quot; my &quot;request&quot; to lock the doors.  I just want them to lock, and if I lock my keys in my car then it's my own dumb fault and that's what AAA is for.

When you shift from park, the doors automatically lock.  I do like this feature; however, I don't like that they don't automatically unlock until you actually turn off the key.  The timing just seems silly to me.

<b>Stereo</b>:  While I was pleased overall with the stereo and the sound system, I didn't like that the radio didn't have a &quot;scan&quot; feature, only &quot;seek&quot;.  When you're driving out in the middle of nowhere, it's often difficult to find a radio station that's not just static.  And they often fade in and out quickly.  During these times I like to set the stereo to scan and just stop it when something appeals to me.  I miss this feature, and quite frankly would rather have it than seek.

I also found it a bit, oh, perhaps unnerving is the word, that the stereo stayed on even after I turned off the key...until I actually opened my door.  Again, this seems silly...if one wants to turn off the engine but keep the radio on they can just keep turning the key past &quot;off&quot; to &quot;auxiliary&quot; or whatever they call it.  I think this is the type of thing that should be programmable, but apparently it isn't.  I didn't like having to open my car door in 30ï¿½ weather to shut off the radio while I gathered myself for my next meeting (which I prefer to do in silence) - but it was either that or simply power off the radio, which is also annoying because then I have to turn it back on when I get back in the car.

<b>Headrests</b>:  I admit, I am spoiled by the headrests in my car.  They &quot;fold&quot; forward and backward, so they truly do support your head in an upright position, rather than having to lean your head back to be able to rest it.  These headrests, however, do not have that feature.  Additionally, there is this big hole in the center...and I can't quite figure out what purpose it could serve except as a place for your small child to stick his/her head and get it stuck.  I didn't like that part of the back of my head went through this hole when I tried to lean back.  It just felt <i>weird</i>.

<b>Cup holders</b>:  I appreciate the fact that they were trying to be space efficient when designing the cup holders.  They fold out from the center console/armrest, and at a quick glance you'd probably think it was an ashtray.  The openings were small - so small that anything larger than a 12 oz. can of soda barely fit.  They were also too shallow to prevent spills if the base of the container didn't fit snugly - a skinny bottle of water toppled over while making a turn (glad the lid was on it!).

And the placement was all wrong to me...when I had a bottle or cup in the holder I couldn't rest my arm comfortably like I wanted.  I had to either hold my hand in my lap or flop it over into the other seat - neither of which was a very comfortable position in my opinion.

Now that I've nitpicked the car to death, I'll tell you what I liked about it.  I liked the power...the car definitely moved when I stepped on the gas!  The ride was smooth, quiet, and comfortable - my back didn't protest for at least two hours.  It got decent gas mileage - average 26 mpg on my mostly-highway trip.  The interior and trunk were very spacious - I think five adults could travel very comfortably in this car.

So perhaps you're not as picky as me.  If that's the case, then I think you'll like this car.  However, if you're like me and think that the little things make or break something, you might not like it.  Bottom line, it's a great car, as long as you're not easily annoyed.  :)<br><br>
