            I bought my 1998 VW Beetle because I loved the looks.  The car was peppy and handled well.  Unfortunately, what's behind the looks has lead to a deluge of minor and major mechanical problems.  Minor problems included security system not responding, sensor warning lights coming on for no known reason, electrical mirrors not working independently, audio system volume shooting up when turned down, broken glove box latch and lights working unreliably.  Minor to major problems included the cruise control and air conditioning going out. And finally the water pump went out and the engine was damaged.  VW blames us for the damage and refuses to replace the engine under warranty.  This is the very worst car I have ever purchased for reliability!<br><br>
