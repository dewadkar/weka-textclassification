            I bought a 325 brand new in March 2001 (delivered from GER in May) and haven't regretted it for a second.  As of August of 2002, I have roughly 15,000 miles logged and only a few glitches to mention.

<b>Performance</b>
This car handles like a dream.  The beefy sports suspension sticks to the road like glue in tight turns.  Although the 325 only has 184 horsepower it get around quite well (0-60mph in 7.1 seconds).  The 330 does a little better (6.4 sec) but I don't think it's worth the extra money.  From what I've seen all your getting is a bigger engine.  If you really want performance just fork over some serious cash and get an M3 (my future car... hopefully).

Everyone is very impressed when they ride in my car.  I'm already used to it and that's my main concern... I'm "stuck" driving a BMW for the rest of my life.  There's no going back for me!

<b>Safety</b>
Wow, safety.  Plenty to mention here.  Large brakes = stopping power.  Agile maneuvering = accident avoidance. If you were to hit something I can assure you that a plethora of airbags would come to your rescue.  Front and side airbags are standard as well as side head airbags (which aren't found on many cars).  All BMWs have done amazingly well on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's off-set crash test... seen many times on shows such as Dateline.  Also, look at the inside of the doorjams... there are little hooks and holes.  When the car is hit from the side the hooks "sink in" so that it makes one continuous doorbeam across the car to protect you.  Those Germans... very clever!

<b>Options</b>
My car is pretty basic... no luxury items at all.  The fake leather is great, no one can tell the difference.  No sunroof... my shaved head would burn anyway.  I did get the sport package... a must!  The bucket seats are worth the extra $1100 alone.  Also with the Sport Package comes larger 17" tires and rims, wider low-profile sport tires, a sport suspension package, and a three spoke sport steering wheel.  As of the 2001 model year it was required to get CD as an option (I believe it is now standard as of 2002).  The onboard computer was the cherry on top for me (just to keep track of mpg, average mph, etc).

I believe when buying a BMW it's essential to research the options and decide which are most important to you.  Don't plan on buying one off the lot... they're usually equipped with the premium package, heated seats, and the upgraded stereo.  There are plenty of other worthy options out there!  I've yet to see a new BMW on the lot with the Sport package... a disgrace!  You'll have to put around $1000 down as a deposit and depending on availability the wait will be 2 months.  Remember, a watched pot never boils... just order it and forget it or you'll go mad!  If your smart (like moi), you can get a rock-solid car for a "good" price (that's all relative, of course).

<b>Price</b>
I believe the sticker price of mine came it at just a hair over $30,000.  Not bad for such a great car!  A mediocre SUV would cost as much or more these days.  With a little shrewd bargaining and some great timing I walked away with a price of $28,112 and free BMW embroidered floor mats (those aren't included).  It's important to note that BMW keeps a tight reign on each dealer's inventory, so getting a deal in a hot market is difficult.  Sometimes a BMW dealership has more customers then they do cars to sell (it's not like GM where they'll make as many as they can sell).  Quite often people get caught paying sticker price. >:^\\

Another thing to consider is "Cost of Ownership."  BMW cost more upfront, but they lose less of their value percentage-wise than other brands such as VW, GM, etc.  When this is taken into account, the price becomes a bit more "reasonable."  On the other hand, you could just keep it and drive her for 200,000 miles.  Your choice.

<b>Problems/Service/etc</b>
I did have one recall on my car for an engine fan.  I didn't actually have a problem with mine, but they replaced it anyway.  Then, months later I believe a different fan went bad on my car so I had to take it in to be repaired.  The service was great, they sent me away with a free rental car and had it ready that evening for me.  Most BMW dealerships have an Enterprise Rental Car dealership inside.  Some dealers, like where I originally purchased my car, have a fleet of BMWs to loan out during servicing.

I found the service to be quite satisfactory.  When something goes wrong, and it will with ANY car, you can count on BMW to stand by you.  The car comes with a 4yr/50,000 mile warranty as well as all scheduled maintenance covered for 3yr/36,000 miles.  That means oil changes, inspections, worn brakes, new windshield wipers, etc.  For the first 36,000 miles you won't have a care in the world... just put gas in it!

<b>Summary</b>
It's very simple, mere words will not do this car justice.  If you are at all considering buying one then you should get off the computer and take a testdrive.  Period!
