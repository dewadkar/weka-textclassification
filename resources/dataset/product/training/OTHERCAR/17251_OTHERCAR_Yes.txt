            After having been very happy with my 1991 Dodge Daytona for 9 years, it was time for a new (used) car for me.  I was first turned on to the Intrepid when my brother in law was car shopping and I went with him.  I loved the look of the car and the inside was very room and comfortable.  A few months after shopping with him, I decided I wanted the Intrepid,  but from what I had read in Consumers, I figured I would get a 1999 model, which I had no trouble in finding.

Now mind you I had always owned small cars before this (Shadow and Daytona)before this and the thought of driving a big car was an intimidating factor for me.  However, after the first test drive I was hooked and had an easy time adjusting to driving a large car.  The front seats were very comfortable for me, especially my lower back which is bad.  The back seats were very roomy and with the passenger side seat pushed all the way back,  the dealer (who was sitting in the back) still had plenty of leg room and he was a big boy!

The trunk is also very roomy and can hold a significant amount of items in it.  I have been averaging roughly 27.5 mpg, so I am quite happy with these results.  The only negative things I can say about the car are that it can be a bit noisy driving, and that the base model (which is what I have), has the 2.7 liter V6 engine, which can be a little slow at the start.  But these little items would certainly not discourage me from suggesting this car as an excellent buy.<br><br>
