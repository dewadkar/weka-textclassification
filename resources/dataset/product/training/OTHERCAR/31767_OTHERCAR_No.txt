            Driving a BMW does live up to its slogan of being the Ultimate Driving Machine. My 99 328i handles great in a tight corner, and speeds up nicely on highways (even out-maneuvered a viper).  However, the enjoyment lasts as long as the car is running properly.

I bought my silver/black 99 328i in 1998.  It was fully loaded with GPS Navigation, BMW integrated cell phone, BMW 6 CD Changer, BMW alarm, Harmon Kardon premium sound system, heated seats, ski sack and premium package.  It brought me so much attention as well as exhilaration while driving.

However, I have had over 6 separate incidents in which I had to either bring the car back to the dealer, or have it towed.  

Most issues are with the electronic systems, such as sensors :
 - seat occupancy sensor - airbag won't deploy in case of an accident,
 - engine check light (twice)
 - malfunctioning HK amplifier (still on order to be replaced)
 - gas gauge / computer remaining miles goes up while driving more.

But there are major issues:
 - failed alternator, when driving out of town (1 entire week to replace)
 - failed AC compressor, climate control kept blowing hot air in summer (4 days to replace)

Although BMW replaced all the defective parts based on warranty, most dealers don't keep parts locally.  So every single repair takes about a week.  I either have to visit a dealer twice (once driving over 150 miles one way for the alternator work, once over 50 miles one way for the seat sensor, and it took 2 trips: one for diagnostics, one for the actual replacement).  And still the amplifier is on ordered.  If you live in a big city such as SF or Boston, you know how hard it is to get an appointment.

Imagine how much I had to go through to keep this car running!

I am sure this does not happen to every new BMW, maybe just because it was the first year for the new design, but the possibility of it happening again is still there.  I admit that I would consider buying another bimmer next time, just for the nice ride.  However, other people don't agree completely, and based on my experiences, 4 of my friends decided to buy MB (2 ML320) and Lexus (ES300 and RX300) within the last month.

I hope BMW will one day iron out all the little quality issues and make this a truly great car for the all people.
