            I would like to begin by responding to some of the negative comments I have read.  A few people complained about the vehicles low-end torque and how the majority of the power lies in the midrange.  This may be true if the person driving is not use to the clutch or is not familiar with driving a manual transmission. From this drivers perspective it has plenty of punch. I have had my 225hp TT for about two months now and have averaged about a one thousand miles a month.  

The two things I love most about the car are its looks and its performance.  In the looks department the car is second to none.  Last week I parked the car in the middle of town while I ran into a pizza shop to grab a slice.  When I came out, I caught some guy standing next to my car talking to some girl pretending that the TT was his. You should have seen the look on both of their faces when as I clicked the unlock button on my alarm, got in, put down the top and drove off.   If that&#146s not a compliment, I don&#146t know what is.  

 The satisfaction I get when I blow the doors off of a Z3/Z4 or a Boxter is indescribable.  I am not sure why some people are saying that the Boxter out-performs the 225hp TT.  Time after time I smoke each and every Boxter off the line and around the corners.  As for the Z3/Z4, so many people own them; they have become played out.   The BMW Z series is now commonplace, ordinary, and also ugly.  The only car that actually seems hold its own is the S2000 (Some guy gave me a run for my money the other day, we were pretty much even the entire way, until we come up on a pretty treacherous corner, then I ate him for breafast.).  
  
Not only does this car have great acceleration, but it also handles like it&#146s on rails.  The Quattro system allows the tires to grip the road like a fat kid grips an ice cream cone.  In both accounts neither one will ever let go.  

Regarding the cars appearance, some derogatory comments I have read say that the TT looks like a squished VW bug.  To make such an asinine remark is ignorant and spiteful.  Saying the Audi TT looks like a squished bug, is like saying a 911 Carrera looks like a Karmann Ghia. There is no comparison!
