            The Altima, Nissan's Hope for a Bright Future.

Nissan Altima SE, 2003 

The past decade has been tough for this once very profitable car manufacturer. The years when Nissan (then called Datsun) were a certain success are gone. Nissan has been trying very hard to get back to the top of the foreign export market. 

To achieve this they are offering better cars and the pricing even though a little above the average in each category, is still quite acceptable when you take the standard features that Nissan equipped their automobiles with. 

The Nissan Altima SE 2003 is the best selling Nissan model for the past few years and for a good reason it is a very well built automobile and it comes fully loaded with an excellent selection of standard comfort features and safety features. 

Consumers have the choice of three different models. The is the basic 2.5 S trim which comes equipped with few standard features, then the middle of the line 3.5 SE and follows the top model 3.5 SL. The object of this review is the Altima 3.5 SE, so the reminder of this opinion will concentrate on that particular trim. The Nissan Altima has a curb weight of 3,195 pounds and a wheelbase of 110.2 inches. It measures 191.5 inches in length and 70.4 inches wide. One thing I like more about the Nissan Altima is that it comes with either a full list of standard safety features plus a few more that are available as options. 

The inside cabin of the Altima SE is very well put together, one can notice the high quality of the material used and the workmanship.The Nissan Altima 3.5 SE is very well equipped with standard features, The one I drove was loaded: Air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, leather seat, AM/FM radio, CD player, sunroof, window defroster and alloy wheels. 

The space in the front seat area of the Altima is comfortable, but is is somewhat tight in the back seat. 
As for the exterior I like its appearance. I like the selection of alloy wheel on the Altima I drove, it really gives this automobile some style. 

The Altima has a cargo volume of 15.6 cubic feet, which should give you sufficient rooms to transport all your gears and groceries. 

The Nissan Altima 3.5 SE had a 3.5-liter, 6-cylinder engine that develops 240 horsepower. As for the transmission it is equipped with a 4-speed automatic transmission.. The car comes equipped standard with dual airbags and side airbags are optional as is the traction control features. 

Aside from the price, I like every thing about the Nissan Altima 3.5 SE. This car is loaded with comfort and safety standard features. The Altima is a dream to drive on the highway and a breeze to drive within city streets.
