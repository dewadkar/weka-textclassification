            I go camping alot and usually take along a ton of stuff.  I needed a vehicle that was durable and could hold alot.  I also wanted some room in the cab to put things that shouldn't be out in the elements on the way to the campsite.  When shopping around I found the Nissan King Cab.  It was several thousand less than other comparable vehicles.  I bought it in '94 when it was only 4 years old and had 50,000 miles on it.  The truck looked like it had been taken care of really well.  
Since then I have had no major problems with this vehicle.  It now has 116,000 miles on it and I have never taken it in for anything more than routine maintenance.  
At this point it is getting a little rust.  The tailgate has got a couple of large rust patches.  The guy at the body shop tells me that this is because of a defect in the welds inside the tailgate.  Essentially the rust is beginning inside the tailgate and working its way out.  The only cure is to replace the entire tailgate.  
Also the door seals are getting a little leaky.  I live in North Dakota and you sure can feel it in the truck when the wind blows.  But as far as engine work I couldn't be happier.  
I agree that the engine is not always up to the task.  We had a hard time pulling a trailer through the badlands, but for most trips it is fine.  The fold down back seats are fine if you are very small.  My friends usually use them when we are just going around town.  I sat back there once and I tell you never again.  It's my truck and I won't sit back there if I don't want to!
