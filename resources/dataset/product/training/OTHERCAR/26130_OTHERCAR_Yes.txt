              Since the Hyundai Sonata's infamous introduction in the '80s one would think this car would have been dropped long, long ago, but alas it is now 2002 and the Hyundai Sonata is not only still here, it is better than ever. The 2002 Sonata competes very well with the competition, and in some respects blows the competition out of the water. 

  The 2002 Hyundai Sonata is available in 3 trim lines, the base model, which is powered by a 2.4 liter 4-cylinder engine, the GLS, and LX. My test car, a Sonata GLS came standard with a 2.7 liter DOHC V6 that pumps out an adequate 181 horsepower, and 177 lb-ft of torque.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 


The Sonata offers good Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b>, but lacks the grunt associated with the V6 engines in the Accord and Camry. With only 177 lb-ft of torque on tap, the Sonata needs a heavy foot to get this 3,200lb vehicle ahead of the pack. Don't get me wrong, the Sonata does offer good acceleration, but I feel that a slightly larger engine, matched with more power would have given the driver more excitement. This small displacement V6 is especially felt on Hills. The Sonata does a good job tackling steep inclines, but the engine needs to strain a little, and this strain (in the form of harsh engine noise) is heard quite clearly in the cabin. 

<b>Handling</b> in the Sonata is excellent, especially for a family car. Body roll, and lean are kept to a minimum, and road-holding is better than expected. With 4 wheel disc brakes, my test Sonata, despite not having ABS, still maintained good <b>braking.</b> 

<b>Cruising</b> in the Sonata is where this car is felt at home, the RPMs stay low, the cabin remains quiet, and wind and engine noise are kept to a minimum. <b>NOTE:</b> Expect to get between 27-30 mpg while doing conservative freeway driving with the V6 equipped Sonata's.

   The 2002 Sonata sits on a  106" wheelbase, and has an overall length of 185.4". The Sonata features an all independent <b>suspension</b>, and has front and rear anti roll bars.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

  The <b>Interior</b> of the Sonata is this car's strongest attribute. Standard amenities are galore, along with creature comforts, and surprisingly classy wood grain. My Test GLS came standard with a driver side air bag, driver and passenger air bags, a 6 speaker cassette/CD player, power antenna, a center console, cup holders, cruise control, a trip computer, air conditioning, a thick leather wrapped steering wheel, and much more. The drivers position is excellent, and so is rear vision. The Seats were made of very comfy cloth, the drivers seat offered adjustments along with lumbar support. The rear seats are 60/40 split, and also offer good comfort. Room is adequate for a family sedan, plenty of room up front, and as long as the seats are not pushed all the way back, the rear passengers will also enjoy the luxury of good leg room.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

 The <b>exterior</b>, while a bit controversial, I find quite inviting, and a nice change from the Sonata's previous style. (pre '99) The head lamps are flush, and give a 'peanut like' appearance which accents the front fascia of this car quite well. The lines of the 2002 Sonata are modern, and pleasant. Many people compare the Sonata's lines with Jaguar's, I personally don't see the resemblance. Like most modern family cars, the hood of the Sonata is sloped, giving the driver good visibility, while also helping aerodynamics.

<i>Price, Reliability, and Warranty</i> 

The 2002 Sonata starts at around $15,000 for the base model, but with options, and packages the price can rise over $20,000. The 2.7 liter engine is new, so its too early to comment on reliability. If anything does happen to your new Hyundai Sonata, Hyundai offers one of America's best Warranties, 10 year, 100,000 mile powertrain coverage.


<i>Final Thoughts:</i>

The 2002 Hyundai Sonata offers a great value. While some of the plastics in the interior are on the cheap side, the amount of standard amenities, the price, and the awesome warranties give this car my recommendation.
