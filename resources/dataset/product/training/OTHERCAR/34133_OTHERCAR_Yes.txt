               Well, well, hear we are at the threshold of the Automotive worlds' who's who of prototypes.  Personally I am a firm believer in the North American Automobile, and have experienced cars of all makes in all situations from family to the pro racing circuits. Let me tell you, when it comes to overall complete five star coverage of cars that have taken interest in sparing no feat of modern engineering, design, comfort and style there is only a handful that qualify at this competitive level. Although many will disagree, (particularly import lovers...), cars such as the Mercedes, BMW and Audi, are an excellent choice when choosing in the luxury car level, but no car built between 1985 and 1992 can even compete with the&quot;BRATPACK&quot; of luxury coupes built in those years. These cousins are non other than the three proto-type coupes Designed and built buy GM and there names are Toronado, Riviera and Eldorado.
    In this class of automobiles between the years of 1986 and 1992 GM re-defined the car universe with its unveiling of the proto-typical coupes the BRAT PACK of cars. Between the three of them its nothing short of music to anyones ears, and boy do they put on a show.  These three siblings together cover more ground than water in satisfying attention to consumer needs and best represent the American car enthusiast but most of all and over all the Toronado by Oldsmobile, Riviera by Buick and Eldorado by Cadillac are the most bang for your buck and 'til this day still hold the rank of some of the best cars ever built. They turn heads and offer value in every aspect. <br><br>
