            I bought this car becouse I liked the looks, espacially of the front end. I bought my car new from the dealer in 1992. It is flame red, with aspholt gray interior. The engine came standard with a 3.1 v6 which provides ample power at low torqe, but dont try to race it. The car is slow especially in highway travel. It is difficult to change lanes, due to not enough power. The interior is not bad for the fron passenger and the driver, but the rear seats are cramp. My rear seats are bench seats, getting in and out of them is very difficult. Every passenger that rides in the back usually complains of getting in, and out of the car. This car is very heavy and all the weight is in the front. The car is great in snow, and emergency stopping. The chief complain that I have is the maintenance on the car that you must keep up with at all times. After I bought the car, the first year I drove 12 thousand miles on it, Alternator went, two months later the brakes. This car has a brake problem, and Im not talking brake pads. This car is very front heavy cousing extreme heat on the brake pads and rotors. I need to change the pads every 5-7 thousand miles, and the rotor every 10-15 thousand miles. Now a new problem with the car is the seals. First it was the oil pan gasket, then the transmission gasket. Gass usage is not bad, but could be much better. I drove this car from NY to florida several times and the cars gas consumption is ok on the highway, but poor in the city. When I purchased this car I was single, now I have a familly, and its too small for three of us and our stuff. Toyota sienna here I come.<br><br>
