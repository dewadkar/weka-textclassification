            You already know about the Honda and Integra heritage of the car, I'm sure.  If not, read the other opinions on this fine car.  They've covered it pretty well.

First off, let me say that, in fact, most of you will drive UNDER 100 mph and have the tach UNDER 6000 RPM most of the time.  So this is not a review of the RSX as a "sports car," because it isn't a sports car.  Neither is it a luxury car.  The wonderful thing about the RSX is that it is an excellent compromise between the two.

Let's start with the interior, since that's where you spend most of your time.  The seats are firm and supportive, and have excellent side bolstering.  Our last car seemed to have bolsters designed for folks 100 pounds heavier than we, so these are a welcome change.

The dash is plastic.  This car costs under $25,000, so, yes, the dash is plastic.  Large parts of it, however, have a texture that makes it feel pretty nifty, and less "plasticky."  Totally subjective, isn't it?

Climate control and stereo controls are wonderful.  If I can just start hitting buttons and figure it out within a minute or two, I know it's a nice system.  Whether or not you find them "futuristic" or "driver-oriented," you'll probably appreciate their solid feel as you turn the knobs.

The only omission that's missed in the front is a center arm rest.  The car is pretty narrow, so I understand why it's not there, but on longer trips, it's kind of a shame.

Our is an automatic transmission.  The Sequential SportShift feature is in constant use by both my wife and myself.  We are unfamiliar with true manual transmissions, so I figure this is a nice set of training wheels.  The shifter overall is somewhat baffling, following the current trend of making the driver negotiate a maze of passages to put the car in Park.  I guess it's just trendy, but it is annoying.

The engine is just wonderful.  Plenty powerful for all city driving.  Again, it's not a sports car, especially at base trim level.  Even so, it's still every bit as fast in a straight line as our '66 Mustang, with its 289 ci V-8.  There is enough noise at high revs to let you know you're having fun, but when you're feeling more subdued, you'd never know it's even running.

Handling is nimble and light feeling.  The car is incredibly rigid compared to others we've driven.  At the same time, however, the ride is not harsh nor overly loud.  Again, an excellent compromise.  Steering is good at high speeds, but I would like a little more assist at parking lot speeds.

What really helped us into the Acura was that there are so few options on the car.  Most everything we wanted on this level of car was already provided.  Air conditioning, moonroof, CD player, ABS, four airbags, driver's side floor ... it's all there.  Many manufacturers, sadly enough, are still making you buy safety separately.

That's it for the RSX.  Buy it!  Here's what else we drove:

<b>The Honda Accord Coupe</b>:  Not sporty.  This is, as my friend Bill phrased it, an "empty-nester's car."  It is very nice, but too well-isolated from the road, too squishy, and too slow for us.  I thought that the 200-hp VTEC engine would really scoot us along, but it sure didn't feel like it.

<b>The VW New Beetle</b> Turbo:  Fun!  This car was definitely a pleasure to drive.  They <b>still</b> attract attention, and the dealer was a sport, giving it to us for a full 24 hours to drive around.  However, even he couldn't help us navigate the confusing model designations and option packages (Now, do you want the GLS? GLX?  GLX-Sport with Turbo Bud Vase?) that VW is persistent in offering.  Plus, when it came down to it, with my masculinity at stake, I couldn't advocate purchasing it.

<b>The Toyota Celica GT</b>:  My wife and I were prepared to be impressed with this car.  It looks great, has adequate power in base trim, and should come with solid Toyota quality.  Well, we were surprised to find ourselves underwhealmed.  Big issues included road noise and headroom (and I'm only 5'9"!).  Couple that with, again, confusing option packages that send your cost spiraling upward, and we became uninterested very quickly.

Barely worth mentioning are the Saturn SC1 (100 horsepower?  That's a typo, right?) and the Hyundai Tiburon (designed for Koreans, whose average male height is less than Americans'), soon to be famous for its extra-long throw shifter.
