            This camera is definitely worth searching for. The pictures taken with this camera will blow you away. Crisp, clear resolution and vivid colors make this an excellent camera for just about any use. E-bay? No problem, all photo details retain their clarity on your auction page. Every e-mail I have sent with this camera has always elicited comments about how beautiful the pictures turn out. There are only two drawbacks that I see. The first being the fact that the camera comes with only a 4 MB memory card. I think that Sanyo should equip their better cameras with more memory to begin with. An 8 MB card is almost a must once you start using the camera more often. The other drawback is a very short re-chargable battery life. They do include 2 sets of batteries and a charger, but it would be nice if they also included an A/C adapter. All in all the SanyoVPC-X350 gives you total value for every dollar spent.<br><br>
