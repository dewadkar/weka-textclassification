            This car was not my own, however, it was my mother's, and I managed to total it...

Last June, I was involved in a high speed, freeway rush hour multi vehicle accident.  I hit, oh, a good 5 people going through the whole mess?  I was barely hurt during the whole thing...  and I was injured the worst of anyone in my car, if that says anything.  I literally thought my life was over as I smashed back and forth into multiple cars...  but this thing took a licking and I came through great.  Hit my head pretty hard, but maybe it resulted in a personality improvement.  ;)

Seriously, I think this is an excellent car for the monetary value.  It's certainly built like a tank and does not look like one.  It's pretty much the same car as one of the Lexus models, so I've heard.  And Toyotas have always had the reputation of lasting until you run them into the ground (my '92 celica keeps on running!), or until you total them, whichever comes first.

And I didn't even mention the roominess in this car.  My mom has fit many in her car, both short and tall, and none have complained about room (or lack thereof).  This is a comfy car!

When my mom first bought a Camry back in '97, she was disappointed that there weren't any Celicas left (like mine) since she liked the look.  But after the first Camry was laid to rest, she went out and bought the exact same thing...  she is sold.<br><br>
