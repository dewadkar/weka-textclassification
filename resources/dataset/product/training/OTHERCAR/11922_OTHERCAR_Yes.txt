            I never cared about digital photography, until I received my &quot;free digital camera&quot; from Earthlink.  It was a cheap thing--I expected more.  Anyway, I was hooked on digital, but I wanted better!  I researched, and headed out to buy a camera.  I ended up with the 780c because of cost and features.  I took my first picture of my sleeping baby girl in the car on the way home.  It took about 1 minute to get the camera out of the box and take a picture.  The 1.8 inch LCD is a great feature you would generally find on more expensive cameras.  You will definitely want rechargeable batteries, and a larger Smart Media card. I get really good 4 X 6 prints, although I have printed good 5 X 7's with the highest resolution.  The software isn't that great, but it will do the job.  A really good camera for the price.


<b><i>UPDATE</b></i>
Since first writing this review, I have returned the camera.  I was having problems with the LCD screen freezing.  Sometimes it didn't come on at all :(  I didn't drop the camera, or anything to make this happen.  I have read comments elsewhere from a couple of people, and this has also happened to them.  I now own an Olympus D-360L, and have written a review on it :)
