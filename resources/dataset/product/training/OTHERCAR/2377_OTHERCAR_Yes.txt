            I've had my SE since 1996, when I found it buried in the back row of the used car lot of a nearby Nissan dealer. It had 21K but it hadn't been cleaned or reconditioned and looked neglected.  They'd been steering me toward an SUV but I had a hunch this was a special car.  I made an offer on the spot ($15K), flustering the salesperson but the manager accepted.  I found out later another salesperson was saving it for a friend.  I know now why.

It is by far the best car I've ever owned.  I marvel at the way it's held up.  Now at 116K, it has never been repaired for anything beyond scheduled maintenance.  

It does everything well.  22 to 28 MPG (use mid-grade), plenty of smooth assured power, nice seats and comfort amenities, quiet with a pleasant but controlled ride.  It's also very roomy with a generous trunk. People guess it's years newer.  It helps that I garage it and wax it every year.  I love this car and even though I get tired of it every once in a while, I know I'd regret letting it go and be jealous of whoever got it.

If you find an SE, especially a 92 to 94, well-cared for and reasonably priced, you've found one of the best all-round values on the market.  The GLX and GLE are nice, but they don't have the sweet dual overhead cam engine, one of the very best V6's on the planet. Be sure and change the transmission oil every 30K and keep an eye on the CV boots and brakes, the two minor weak areas of the car.
