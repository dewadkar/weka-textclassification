            Firstly, I loved this vehicle for the way it looked.  (how shallow I know)
I got in it and test drove it and had to have it!!!  I loved the power.  Mine had no Turbo, but it was a Standard 4 clinder that could squeek the tires.  Obviously, speed is important to me.  After owning it for a year, the only problem I had was the stripping on the door.  The paint was GREAT and nothing broke.  I didn't have to put any Money into this car.  I love that:)  It was reliable and always started.  Another plus, GREAT on GAS!!!!

Unfortunetly, yesterday I got into a head on collission with a truck.  The trucks fender was dented and the side panel.  The Eclipse on the other hand caved in.   It didn't handle the impact well and I now have a bruised sternum, breast, collar bone, leg, adn whiplash!  UGH!!!  I WAS IN THE BACK SEAT no less.  I am just thankful my Daughter wasn't in the car. 

Another down side is the room in the backseat.  There is none and the seatbelts are low harnessed which is why I am so bruised and sore today.  I was ingured the worst out of everyone in the car.  Not Reccomended for family useage!!!  <br><br>
