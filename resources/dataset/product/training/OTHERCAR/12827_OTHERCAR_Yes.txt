            This is a typical Nissan product - fairly good but not quite up to he standard of Toyota or Honda.

I bought this car when it was about a year to two years old
from our local Nissan dealer - BILL RAY NISSAN of Longwood, Florida. I would recommend using extreme caution in buying a used vehicle from this dealer. You will see why below.

After I had the car for about two months I noticed some shaking in the front end. OK the tires were not new, and I knew they would need replacing eventually. I did not have the money for new tires right away so I waited a few more weeks. Meanwhile I got the wheels balanced and rotated and that helped.

However, when I went in to Sears to buy the tires the tech reported that some of the hub bolts were broken out of the wheel hubs!! I went back to the repair place that had aligned my wheels and demanded that they correct the problem that they had caused.

They told me I had to buy two new hub bolts from the dealer.
I did that and they put them on and apologized and everything was OK.

So for the next 6 months or so everything was OK. Then I noticed the old shimmy was back. No one seemed to be able to fix it. Alignments helped. ROtating tires helped, but always after a few months the same thing would happen - shimmying, and eventually I am told the hub bolts are broken - you will need to buy 4 or 5 more.

I had ever heard of these hub bolts breaking. As it turned out the dealer had sold me this used car with aftermarket rims, and they were the wrong type - made in Australia - 
and not perfectly aligned to the hub bolts on my Altima. 
What a pain. I called the dealer BILL RAY NISSAN and they refused to help. Ye sit took almost a year to find out what the REAL cause of this problem was, but still they could have helped and it would not have cost them much.

The Sales Manager at BILL RAY NISSAN was extremely rude to me and said he would not help. I was 100% polite to him, but he eventually hung up the phone on me. I hope for their sake that the same guy is no longer working there as his poor attitude and lack of customer service would persuade many people to never buy from such an outfit as this.

I eventually bought a set of used steel wheels and the car has done fine ever since, but boy did it cause me a lot of aggravation.

My auto tech  has advised me that you should NEVER put after-market rims on a Nissan Altima or on a Maxima, as you will probably have the same problems with either car.

I feel burned by the dealer, but not by the manufacturer or the car itself. It was not their fault, but the dealer should have known better than to sell me a car in that condition, and they should have made it right when the problem was pointed out to them.
