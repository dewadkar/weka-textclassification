            Although I only have one child and our family of three did not need a van, I am so glad I went this route. I figured it would come in handy for our trips we make often and I was so very right. 
   I have a 95 Nissan Quest GXE.  It is fully loaded with plenty of extras such as leather seats, power front seats, cd, am/fm cassette, sunroof. It is roomy for our trips the seats all fully recline and have many different configurations.  The seats are very comfortable esspecially good for long drives.  The van is very easy to drive, not much different from my car. I also love the sporty look of my van.
    The only thing I do not like about my van is the cupholders. The one in the front is not even big enough for a 12 oz soda can, which is very annoying when on long trips and no place for drinks.  There also is not any in the middle section where the captains seats are. So when eating or drinking my son must sit in the very back so he has access to a cup holder.
I would recommend this van to anyone with a family because of the room and the comfort. <br><br>
