                 I purchased my 1991 Rodeo w/ automatic transmission for the sole purpose of ease of transportation of children and hauling items for my home. This truck did not disappoint!! It was a faithful vehicle with a minimum of problems. My only problems came from the GM engine. The truck was equipped with the 6 cylinder General Motors engine, which started acting up with overheating problems. Sometime after running up 75000miles, power windows failed and many minor engine problems. None of which could be solved satisfactorily. After dealing with poor service for 15000 miles, I decided to trade it in. I had several experiences with rough cornering. At higher speeds, the vehicle felt like it was going to flip over. The vehicle was equipped with ABS braking, though it was not comfortable stopping. <br><br>
