                 The best SUV in its class the Jeep Grand Cherokee is probably the most popular SUV. It is so popular because it is extremely powerful and it runs great. It has a 4.7 liter engine powered by 8 cylinders and 235 horses. All of the Jeep Grand Cherokees come with 4 speed automatic transmission. There are air bags for the driver and passenger. It is equipped with air conditioning, power windows, power door locks, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather seats, power seats, AM/FM radio, cassette player, CD player, a sunroof (optional), tachometer, rear window defroster, luggage rack, alloy wheels and a full-size spare tire (optional).
     However, like all vehicles there are the faults that it has. The price of this particular SUV is ranging from $26,000 - $34,000. This is a little expensive but I would definitely say it is still worth buying. Also, the gas mileage isn't that great. You can get around 15-20 miles per gallon with this vehicle. 
    Overall, in my opinion I feel that this is the best SUV  out there. When I drive mine I really do feel like I am &quot;king of the road.&quot; Nothing out there can stop me. I love the feel of this vehicle and I think you should go and buy one in the near future.<br><br>
