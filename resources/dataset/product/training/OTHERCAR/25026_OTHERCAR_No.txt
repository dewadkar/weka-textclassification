            In 1997 we found out we were expecting our third child and decided we should get a minivan.  After looking around we bought a 1995 Plymouth Voyager.  We have had nothing but trouble with it.  For starters we had to replace the transmission after only owning it five months.  The mechanic said he sees mostly Voyagers with transmission problems.  A year later our AC went out.  We spent $300.00 to repair a condenser coils that went bad.  Within a year the AC went out and this time it's the compressor.  We are now looking at a $800.00 repair.  We recently had a problem with what we thought was the alignment and took it in.  We were told our alignment was fine but our van had developed what is know as torque steering.  We can only have that fixed at a dealer.  We had hoped that this van would last us many years but we will be lucky if we can make it to next year without more major work on it.  We will never buy a 
Voyager again!!<br><br>
