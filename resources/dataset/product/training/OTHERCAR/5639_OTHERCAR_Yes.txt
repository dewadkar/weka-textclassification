            Hi all, I just recently purchased a Vibe and I'm loving it.  I'm a practical person and I'll focus on *real life* aspects.

My profile:  I'm 30 years old, 6'2", 2** pounds, married w/o children.

Model bought:  Silver Base Model w Mag wheels and Electrical group of options(power windows, cruise control, etc...)

Comfort:  I find the Vibe much roomier than other cars of its price range.  Lots of head and leg room.  I drive about 70 miles each day to get to work and back in traffic.  The driving position allows for a relaxed handle on the steering wheel and good leg angle which helps when waiting, and waiting, and waiting....

Sound system:  I have the base 4 speaker system with CD and I find that it's loud enough!  The sound is of better quality than all my previous vehicles (Civic, Sentra, Neon, Rav4).

Performance:  The 130 hp engine gives you enough power to pass vehicles on the highway quickly. (I get nervous when riding next to trucks so I enjoy good acceleration).  If you want to race, get the GT.

Interior:  SURPRISE!!!!  Even the sales rep could not tell us where all the hidden storage areas were!  It is a very mature vehicle with a lot of convenient storage.  For example, there's a place for a cell phone, one for sunglasses, another for CDs, etc...  On the down side, I find the fixed luggage-cover a drag.  It's hard to remove and put back on.  A pull-out kind of device would have been much more practical.

Exterior:  I really like the plastic coverings for protection.  How often do you come back from shopping to find out some j%rk open his door into your vehicle?  I have good confidence these coverings will help.

Finally, I really enjoy driving my Vibe. I think it's a great car and since it's really a Toyota with in a Pontiac dress, I'm confident reliability will be above average.  So if you're considering this car, just pick your color!
