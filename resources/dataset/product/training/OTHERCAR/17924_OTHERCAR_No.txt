            We were looking to replace the fleet of company vehicles - about 9 cars used by the management team - with something reliable yet comfortable.  the '98 Avalon XLS seemed to fit the bill.  We negotiated a good price for the  9 cars and ordered them.  

My experience has not been a positive one, and at least three of my peers agree - this cars are not what we expected from the Toyota.  The main complain is the suspension.  It is horrible.  The car, in my opinion, feels like the engineers put a very heavy, large body on Camry underpinnings, so that what worked well in the Camry becomes second rate in the Avalon.  It jumps and sways with bumps like a 70's Chevy Impala.  The dealer, who acknowledges that there is a problem, has systematically replaced the suspension in each of the cars with struts from the Lexus ES300 line (so he alleges).  This has improved the situation but not completely. 

In one of the cars the brakes went out after only one year of use.  The brake pump had to be replaced .  Interior trim parts - the right air conditioner vent - seem fragile and tend to break.

The sound system is very good, however.  Excellent bass, and a bump-proof CD-changer.  

The leather in the steering wheel is falling off (peeling) in three of the cars.  Toyota is replacing this under warranty, but it is strange.  It only happened to the cars with the beige leather interior.

The Toyota dealership has been accommodating throughout all of this, but I did not expect this much trouble or dissatisfaction from a Toyota product.  It is a nice car in general - very fast, powerful drive train. The suspension is horrible, however.

My 2 cents, based on a sample size of 9 cars.<br><br>
