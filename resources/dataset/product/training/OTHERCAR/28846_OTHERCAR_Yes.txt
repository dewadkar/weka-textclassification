            I use a company owned Kodak DC210 to take progress photos of a construction site.  And it does a fairly decent job collecting hundreds of photos every month.  We download photos to our computers each day to keep a detailed record of progress, and &quot;good pictures&quot; are chosen each month to be included in our printed version of progress reports that are mailed to company headquarters. Kodak DC210 is a good mega pixel camera for this purpose.  

If your primary reason for buying a digital camera is to post photos over the internet, a DC210 should be considered.  Anyone who has a passion for great photographs, however, won't be happy with a DC210.  Here's why....

A megapixel camera just cannot produce the details that I would like to see in a great photograph.  This is so true when a scenery is involved.  My biggest frustration is when I must take a picture against lighting.  DC210 does not have the controls to deal with less than ideal lighting conditions.  A fill flash mode available with DC210 is good only when the subject is relatively close. The poor exposure control is most evident when there is a big contrast between the subject and surroundings.  The camera seems to read overall lighting conditions to select the best exposure timing and this almost always underexposes the subject unless flash is used.  For this reason, I can almost guarantee that ones who regularly take pictures of people with darker skin color will never be satisfied with this camera. Sure, the final output could be adjusted using a computer program, but who wants to mess with every single photographs?

Two additional minor dislikes I have with this camera are (1) there is nothing protecting the lens..not even a lens cap, and (2) my nose is always rubbing against its LCD screen while viewing through view finder.

I always thought a USB connection was a must, but I found downloading picture data from a compact flash card to PC via SanDisk connection very convenient.  The bottom line?  Just like anything else, you must weigh in what is needed and wanted in a camera, and get one that meets your need.  For me, I &quot;WANT&quot; (1) minimum 2 mega pixel, (2) manual exposure control, (3) built in lens protection, (4) USB connection, or 340MB microdrive system.  

Since I just WANT a digital camera, I can wait as long as I can control my desire!<br><br>
