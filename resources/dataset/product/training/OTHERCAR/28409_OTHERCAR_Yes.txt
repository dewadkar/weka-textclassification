            I leased a 1998 Nissan Maxima SE and this is the BEST car I have ever owned (leased).  I plan to buy this car at the end of the lease term.

The 1995 to 1999 model Maxima's are basically the same aside from some minor cosmetic changes.  They all share the same engine/drivetrain. 

I opted for the SE model for the upgrades and sport equipment including 16&quot; alloy wheels, rear spoiler, 4 wheel disc brakes &amp; stiffer suspension.

I have read some of the other reviews and agree that this car has great acceleration and handling characteristics.   It is very fun to drive and has been very reliable so far.   I still see many Maxima's from the 1980s on the road which makes me confident that this car should last 10+ years with little trouble.

The front seats are roomy.  The rear compartment could be larger, but is adequate and will accommodate 2 child/infant seats without much hassle.  The rear seats could have been designed to completely fold down to accommodate larger items rather than just the center arm rest.

I think that the base GXE models look a little boring but the upgraded wheels on the GLE &amp; SE and spoiler on the SE give the vehicle an appealing look without being too gaudy.  I think this vehicle can compete with LEXUS as far as styling and quality and will blow the doors off of 90% of most sedans on the road.

This car offers a lot of bang for the buck!<br><br>
