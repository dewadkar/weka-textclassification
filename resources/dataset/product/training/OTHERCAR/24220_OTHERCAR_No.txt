            1994 Dodge Dakota Club Cab - I bought this vehicle primarily to tow my boat and do miscellaneous errands for the house, i.e. mulch, branches, appliances and furniture.

At first I was pleased with the vehicles' performance, gas mileage and comfort. I especially liked the appearance, especially with the fender guards and pinstripe.

I began having problems with my vehicle only 6 months after the purchase (I bought mine used with 40000 miles).  The first such problem was with the timing chain.  It made a rattling sound which was mistaken by the mechanic as a tensioner.  I left the vehicle over the weekend and picked it up on Monday, only to hear the same problem.  Further diagnosis pointed to the timing chain, which was replaced.  Another 6 months later and at about 60000 miles, I began having problems with the engine racing on hot days.  I was cooked if I sat at a light for more than 30 seconds, starting from a dead stop at a traffic light was horrible, the engine rpms were off the gage, and the coolant temperature would rise.  I took the vehicle in and reported the problem, no problem was detected, since the vehicle was being serviced in an air conditioned garage, the mechanic said he &quot;could not duplicate&quot; the problem.  Well, just lucky I didnt get stranded 500 miles from home on this one.  I took it to the mechanic at the hometown dealership and they found the radiator to be the problem.  only 4 months later another problem.  This time I was stranded at a Wal-Mart parking lot 500 miles from home.  The vehicle would turn over and turn over but would not start.  Well 3 tows later and about $400.0 in unnecessary vehicle repairs the dealership assured me that they had found the problem, a &quot;CAM SENSOR&quot;.  They replaced the sensor and sent me back home with the assurance the problem was fixed.  Two weeks and two tows later at my hometown dealership the problem turned out to be nothing more than a $4.00 shutdown sensor.  It would have been as simple as replacing a fuse, so I was told.

My current dilemna is with the oil pressure.  The local dealership replaced the manifold intake gasket and replaced the necessary fluids, and I am still having the original problem.  The vehicle now has 100,800 miles on it, and I was told that it was normal for the oil pump to be going out.  Now I have to let the vehicle sit for 10 minutes, risking engine life, to prepare the vehicle to drive, checking to see that the oil pressure makes it at least half way up the gage.  If I start out with a cold engine the oil pressure bottoms out, as if it cant pump the thick oil.  This may very well be normal for a Dodge Dakota's oil pump, to go out at just over 100,000 miles.

Well, you can see the dilemna's I have faced with my Dakota.  I think that overall it is a reliable vehicle, gets good gas mileage, around 20 miles highway, 17 city.  It does have a problem managing hills though.  And I can safely tow my boat, although it is a 16 ft. boat, it is a little push on hills for the truck.  The turning radius on the vehicle is a down.  The vehicle usually takes two attempts when parallel parking, definately does not turn on a dime.<br><br>
