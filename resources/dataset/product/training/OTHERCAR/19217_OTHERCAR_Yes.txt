            It just about killed me to give up this car.  Fortunately it stayed in the family.  When my Dad got this car in 1995 as a company car, he was given three choices.  If I remember right, I think it was Taurus, Sable or LeSabre.  Since I was a Taurus and Sable hater (but I've been converted -- see that review for my more enlightened view!), I said &quot;take the LeSabre&quot;.  And am I ever glad I did.  It got to about 95,000 before it needed major repairs (water pump).  It got new brakes at about 80,000 miles.  And it was a commuter car (read:  on the brakes constantly for two hours per day).  And was it ever great on legroom!  I could put the seat all the way back (which is my preferred place for driving since I have long legs), the person in the back seat still has great legroom!  In fact, for family trips, the choice was between a LeSabre and a Cadillac Brougham (think non-stretch limo).  And I invariably chose the LeSabre because it was more comfortable.  

It has tremendous trunk room -- two sets of golf clubs plus a couple of aisle bags (the bags on wheels the flight attendants carry) fit quite nicely. Or a huge grocery shopping trip (20+ bags).  What's even nicer is that it had one of those nets so I could put just a couple of grocery bags in and not have them tip over when I went up or down hills (which I did a lot of!).  

As for pep, it's got plenty!  My Dad used to tease me about wanting to take the hot rod, but it was only half in jest -- his previous cars wouldn't accelerate for love or money most of the time, but this one was terrific.  And great on gas mileage too.  We had it pretty loaded (all but a sunroof)-- the cruise made for a very smooth ride -- not the jerky ride that I experienced with the Avalon a couple of weeks ago, and not free-fall going down hills that so many older GM cars have because the cruise governor doesn't work right.

So if it's such a great car why didn't I keep it?  Well, three reasons.  I already had a car that was less than a year old that I adored (see the Saab 900 review for it's description).  Second, while I loved the car, I saw it for &quot;older&quot; people.  As in married people with kids, not necessarily older in age.  It's a couples car.  And I'm not half of a couple.  Third, I think I was either generous or stupid or both.  Word was passed that someone needed a car, I thought I &quot;should&quot; get rid of it and it became a done deal.  Not that I'm sorry I did it because I'm not.  But I did love that car.  

What would I change?  Add seat heat in the front seat.  OK, so I'm spoiled.  Put in a different style of cupholder (a la the one in the Taurus) because the one that's in the armrest has a hard time with my monster drinks.  Spring for the sunroof.<br><br>
