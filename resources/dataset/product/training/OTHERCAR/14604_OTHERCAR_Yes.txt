            I purchased my 1991 Honda Accord EX from my Mother in 1993 and I rate this as an excellent and reliable vehicle.  The things I like about it include the excellent acceleration rate for being a 4 cylinder, and the smoothness of the ride.  It has been very reliable compared to our Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I have only been stranded once on the road with the Honda and with the Jeep, I have been stranded about six times.  Since I have a newborn and a three year old this is a really important feature for a vehicle.  The interior is also very nice and is a deep burgundy color, it looks very regal and not cheap like a lot of other similarly priced vehicles.  They appear harder to break into, once I locked my keys in and the police could hardly get it open.  It has a big trunk.      

The cons include: I'll start with the one thing my spouse hates - the automatic seat belt over the shoulder, and I have to say I have gotten tangled up in it once at an ATM (I'm sure the camera loved that!). I have had it in the shop once earlier this year for leaving me stranded on the highway and they replaced the coil, and later this year the air conditioner went out.  They recommend to replace the right outer cv boot and front motor mount which causes the car to shake slightly when idle. That is about all of the problems I have had and it has almost 100,000 miles on it. I wish it had a middle console to store things.         <br><br>
