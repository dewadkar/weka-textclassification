            Although a good friend of mine at work will take credit for planting the seed, I had thought about buying a Vette for a couple of years.  Married with twins buried his dream, so I stepped up to the plate.   I thought, what better time than 2003 which is the 50th anniversary of this Chevrolet masterpiece.   While a 50th Anniversary edition was enticing, I stuck with my original choice, an Electron Blue coupe.  If you have not driven a C5 the power and handling are unbelievable.  My previous car, a 2000 Trans Am WS6, had a ton of power but can't compare in overall performance.  The C5 is incredibly smooth and I've yet to find the limits of what this car can do.  I even have room for two sets of golf clubs which is all you will ever need in a 2-passenger car.   More than I expected, although storage room would be about 100th on the list of reasons why you would buy a Corvette.

The heads-up display is a great feature.  I've had the feature on other vehicles but it is safe to say that I can hit triple digits much faster than before.  Also if you want to make any modifications there are tons of available options around.

Only down side is having to store the car for several months in the winter.  When Spring rolls around I'm sure I'll forget about all of those payments over the winter months while the car sits idle.
