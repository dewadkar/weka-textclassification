            Unless you can find someone who repairs and does maintenance on Kia's "on the side," a Kia Sportage can end up costing you money in the long run. 

For three years, I leased a 1997 Kia Sportage. It was red, manual transmission, and had all the bells and whistles. Although washed and waxed twice a month, the paint fade was significant; I kept the car garaged for all but a few hours each day. Overall, the factory paint job seemed poor. Our other cars did not develop the chips and scratches like my Kia.

A '97 Sportage is fun and easy to drive. With a 4-cylinder engine (standard), it had very low pick-up, which is not the case with our other 4-cylinder vehicles. Once "up to speed," the car ran beautifully. Another plus is a good deal of interior roominess. With the back seats tumbled forward, the back compartment provides a good-size space. The operation to move the seats for extra cargo room was very simple and can be accomplished by one person.

Personally, I did not feel very safe in this vehicle. It is quite compact and I'm grateful I never experienced a collision. While it had a driver-side airbag, aside from seatbelts, passengers had no secondary protection. It seats five, but three people in the back seat was a squeeeeeeze. 

As with all SUVs, the Sportage has a high center of gravity and the driver must corner with care and at a low speed. This seemed to be especially true when the cargo area was packed to the ceiling (once, with several dozen boxes of Girl Scout cookies). 

In closing, I would probably buy or lease this car again <b>if</b> I did not have to transport passengers, if I had the ability to garage the car at all times, and if I had an honest and reliable Kia dealership (or another knowledgeable mechanic with access to parts).
