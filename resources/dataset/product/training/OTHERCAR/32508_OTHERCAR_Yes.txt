            The much anticipated A4 was finally offered for sale in the U.S. in October.  I had driven the 2001 A4 & S4, BMW 325I, and considered the Nissan Maxima, and Acura TL.  I was glad I waited for the new A4!  This car is redesigned inside and out, with minor improvements like the larger rear seat leg area and larger trunk, and major improvements like offering a larger V6 and giving it new exterior styling.  The car is solid and feels well built (the chassis alone is 45% stiffer than the 2001 A4).  The 1.8t quattro is the choice for those who want a sportier, almost harsher engine (you can really hear it spool up!)  The new 3.0 quattro (in either Tiptronic or 6 speed) is a powerful but smooth luxury ride (I can't give an epinion of the CVT as I wanted the quattro option).  The best part about those who buy or lease this car: exclusivity.  You are not going to be part of the cattle on the road driving a BMW, Acura, or other clone.  Just don't subject adults to a 3 hour ride in the back seat, it is (like all cars in this class) a little cramped.  If you are looking for a sports sedan with luxury appointments, give the new A4 a look!
