            I have owned my Nissan Altima for 5 years and I'm very impressed with the car. This car is a great family car and it runs great, plus it does have a bit of get up and go power to it too. This car has been driven to extreme limits and still runs like it was new. The car itself has over 130,000 miles on it and has not had a seriuos problem yet. Another good feature to this car is it gets great gas mileage. Which now that comes in handy exspecially now that gas prices keep going up in price. The handling on this car is great too. I have never had a problem with the steering on the car. I would reccomend this car for new drivers, families that need a good inexpensive car, or older drivers too.<br><br>
