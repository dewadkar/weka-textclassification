            I have had my blazer for about 5 months now. My previous vehicle was a 1994 Ford Taurus with 105,000 miles on it. Bottom line was that the Taurus was dying a quick death and I needed a new family car. My wife was interested in Mini-Vans, but I hate them. I convinced her to test drive the Blazer. Now we own it.

Overall I would rate the Blazer an excellent vehicle so far. It currently has 34000 miles on it. Of the miles we have put on 11000. I will list some of the deciding factors for our family as far as why we picked the Blazer over other SUVs. We test drove several and I will also list why we didn't choose them.

What we drove:
1. Nissan Xterra - Probably my wife's first choice in SUVs. Very Expensive with no dealing room on price. You will most likely pay sticker and get minimum trade if you have one. Was nice to drive and liked the Stadium (raised seats) seating in the rear.

2. Isuzu Rodeo - Nice truck, but didn't like the way the rear door opened. You had to move the tire rack to get the door open and the latch was kind of hard to work.

3. GMC Jimmy - The back tailgate folded down instead of the door lifting up. My wife found that any SUV with the fold-down rear gate was hard to reach into the cargo area.

Blazer dislikes:

1. On the earlier model years (1997, 1998) the rear seat backs are very low. We have 2 teenagers and this was very uncomfortable for them. Chevy went to a high seatback in the rear for 1999 and, I assume, 2000. We ruled out the pre 1999 for this reason.

2. The 4x4 has a hump in the passenger front floor space. At first this was rather annoying, but was soon forgotten. It has not been an issue past the first day.

3. The truck is rather narrow. Not an issue for my family of 4 except when accessing the storage between the front seats. You have to lift up your right arm to get into it.

4. Cup holders in rear passenger doors. Designers should realize kids sit in the rear and slam doors. They don't think about the drink in the door. Can be kind of messy. Nice to have cup holders in the rear, but a better location could be found.

Blazer Likes:

Very numerous, but here are a couple. 

1. I like the location of the cup holders. Very important in a vehicle you are traveling in. 

2. I like the location and design of the controls. Radio, Air, and vents are in intuitive location and are easy to use. 

3. I like the 4x4. If you have never had a 4 wheel drive you should get one. (Even if you don't need it.)

Over all this is the best vehicle I have had to date. I previously owned a 1986 Chevy S10 Tahoe pickup and got 160,000 good miles out of it. Hopefully the Blazer will perform as well. In a comparison of Chevy vs. Ford I would pick Chevy first in an instant. I had nothing but good luck with my Chevy, and nothing but bad luck with my Ford.
