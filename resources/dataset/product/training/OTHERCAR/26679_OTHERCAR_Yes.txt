            I am an automobile fanatic. I love automobiles of all kinds. Sport cars to SUV's, I have driven them all. Driving an automobile is one of life's pleasures in my opinion. When it comes to Sport Utility Vehicles, there are now many choices. The Land Rover is for the type of person who will really use it for what it's intended for - Off Road Adventures. I do not believe this car is the best choice for everyone. Certainly, if the most extreme off roading you are going to do is over the curb while backing out of the driveway! But, I do beleive this car can be a practical family hauler, and a fun recreational vehicle.
I owned this vehicle for 4 years - very few problems to speak of. I took it off road every chance I had and it is amazing what this vehicle can do. It was a just real fun to drive. Back on the road,it drove as if it were brand new despite everything I put it through. I The Atlanta area, we were invited to drive off road at Land Rovers 600 + acre &quot;farm&quot;. This, I believe, is owned by Hennessy Land Rover. The U.S. Camel Trophey Team uses this land to practice. Our trip there was a real eye opener to what the Land Rover could do. Very rugged terrain, stream crossings, mud, tight courses through woods, etc. It was an experience to remember.
When it is time for service, Land Rover North Point in Alpharetta, and Land Rover in Buckehead, have been to the very best at customer service I have ever experienced. I have owned Jaguar, BMW, Ford, Chrysler, GM, Izusu, Nissan, (even a couple of Fiats!), and no one has eevr come close to the level of service we get from Land Rover!
To sum everything up, I feel the Land Rover is one of the toughest vehicles going. I have really enjoyed it and plan on getting a new one. There are other sport ute's out there that have more room, smoother ride, some more conveniences. However, none will match the ruggedness, fun, somewhat exclusivity, unique style, that the Land Rover has. I would Highly Recommended.<br><br>
