              One evening, on the way home from work, the check engine light came on again (my '96 Chevy Silverado). I stopped at the Toyota dealership and traded that evening. I purchased a 1998 Reg. Cab Tacoma, 4 wheel drive. Having driven Chevy and Ford trucks all of my driving life, I was impressed with the solid construction and rugged appearance. I had been looking at these trucks for several months, the check engine light pushed me over the edge. I have had ZERO regrets. The Tacoma is the best built vehicle I have ever owned. With 58,000 miles racked up, it is still as tight as the day I drove off the lot. Never had to take it back to the dealer, for anything.
  This is my first 4 wheel drive vehicle. I have used 4WD on many occasions now, just because I can. This truck floats like a butterfly in all but the thinnest of muds. I have never been stuck, yet. The hills I have climbed in this truck amaze even the hardcore 4WD dudes. The true four-wheel drive makes the difference (locking differential). The ground clearance is excellent, as is the approach / departure angles. I have had to pull my friend's Chevy out more than once. He always wants me to go four-wheelin' with him nowadays.
  The Tacoma has the definite little truck bounce, but after 31 months, I don't even notice it. Especially since I recently installed a set of Michelin LTX A/T's (31x10.5x15). The 5-speed is a bother in traffic, but a godsend in the snow or mud. Gas mileage is fantastic. Last trip, averaging speeds well above the legal limit, returned 22/23 MPG.
  I recommend this truck to anybody wanting a serious go-anywhere vehicle, without the Jeep instability factor. The Tacoma has a very appealing look, the big tires and short wheelbase provide an aggressive stance. The only truck I can see replacing my Tacoma is a Tundra. For now, Oh What a Feeling..................  <br><br>
