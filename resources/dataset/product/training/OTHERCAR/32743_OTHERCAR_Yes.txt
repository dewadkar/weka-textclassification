            I originally bought a 95 Camaro because I wanted a car with a V-6 and a stick shift.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well built it was and how much power the 3.4L engine had compared to other cars I had driven.  I had zero problems with the car and it required little maintenance.  After owning the 95 for 3 years I decided I wanted more power, so I traded the 95 in for a 98.  Equipment wise the two cars are the same except for the 3.8L engine in the 98.  One of the biggest reasons I bought the car besides the power was the price.  The 98 was $17,150.  I've been across country in both cars.  The Camaro is relatively comfortable for long distance riding if you only have 2 people and luggage.  Any more than that and you would be wanting a larger car.  There are only 2 things I don't like about the car.  1.  It sits so low to the ground and the front end is so long that you sometimes scrape the nose on the ground when you go over large dips in the drive surface ie. going into a steep driveway.  2.  Mine is governed at 117mph.  Not that I normally drive much faster than that in the first place.  Overall it is the perfect single guy's car and I would recommend it to anyone who asked.<br><br>
