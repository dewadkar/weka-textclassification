            This Nikon coolpix 775 was an unexpected christmas gift last year.  At first I raved about it.  I loved the small size and the 15 second video feature.  It lasted 4 months before the lens first stopped working (jammed in the open position).  We sent it in in April and finally sometime in August (!) it comes back, supposedly fixed, however now it cannot focus on anything further than 4 feet away.  Close ups are crisp and accurate, but there comes a time when someone might want to actually photograph something more than an arms length away.  So we sent it back in and just today (3 months later) it comes back.  I eagerly unwrap it to try it out...it's as if it has not even been touched.  Exactly the same problem.  I have heard others tell me about lens problems they've been having with the same camera, though their problems are little different, it is clear that this thing is poorly put together and Nikon is either indaunted with returned cameras or doesn't seem to care to much.  I am terrified now to send it back for the THIRD repair attempt, knowing with their current track record, I will not see it again until march, making it almost a full year of not having a camera that someone (luckily my dad) spent WAY too much money on ($375).  

Meanwhile...my wife received a cheap freebie digital camera from signing up with earthlink back in 2000.  This little plastic job probably would go for about 20 bucks today and even with the low quality pictures has proven itself well beyond the short-lived earthlink account.  Originally just a back up camera, it's pretty much been the one to document all this past year's events as old Nikon Coolpix was M.I.A.

In summary:  

Freebie camera from an internet account with just an on/off switch and a flash:  No complaints.

$375 (!) Nikon Coolpix 775 camera packed with features: not worth $20, and apparently in the manufacturer's opinion, not even worth fixing in a timely manner.
