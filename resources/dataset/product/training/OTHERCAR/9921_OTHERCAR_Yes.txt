                 Let me begin with the items that caught my eye.The sporty look. This one that I purchased had 54,012 miles on it. No dents,perfect interior,and it was white with a dark blue streak down both sides of the car,along with dark blue interior.
    This is the GT Coupe model.I bought it from a coworker that had it in storage for about 2 years.I paid $5,500.00 for it. Which everyone tells me that I got an excellent deal for the mileage and brand of car.
    This one has a sunroof,CD player,power windows & locks,power antenna,rear spoiler. This one also has the ability to go VERY fast. It has the ECT (which my wife has not yet use, or will I allow her). It also has the ability to turn off the overdrive, which I prefer to drive with it on, especially since it does pick-up faster, best for the use on the expressway.
   It has cruise control which is very easy to set, it tells you when its on. The dash is very to read for the speed,mileage,and gas and hot/cold readings.
   The heat/air conditioning controls are easy to read, and use. And memorize. There is an in dash digital clock too.
   One of my wifes favorite features are the flip up head lights. Which gives it even more of a sporty look.
   It also has an airbag on the driver side. The seats in the front have great leg room. But for the rear, I suggest small people or children only. This will also have you move UP your front seats to give the people in the rear ample and comfy leg room. The seats are still awesomely comfy.
  ALthough there are only 2 seat belts in the rear, which means that I can only drive with 2 people in the rear, I will not use this one if I need an extra seatbelt. Of course the 2 front seats have belts and work fine!
   My wife and I drove to Tennessee and it was like driving on air. It handles great, and gets great mileage. It was very comfortable, even after the 1,200 mile trip there and back. It is something that we plan to do again real soon in this car.
    The only thing that I had to do as far as maintence was the basics, oil change, anti-freeze,spark plugs. Thats because it sat so long in a garage and was never driven.
    We recently noticed to that the brake pads have to be replaced. As well as the tires which have only started to show the wear and tear of a tire with approximately 55,000 miles on them.
   I did some pricing on the tires the manufacturer requires, and these run anywhere from $89.00-$135.00 depending on the brand. And that's a single tire!
   But considering the money I saved on the cost of the car, it's worth it, knowing that I will have the car longer than the new tires will last.
   Under the hood is something that I will get into as well. The fluid readings are quite easy to read and are easy to find. I did all the minor work myself, and for never having touched a Celica before I must say that it took me about 2 hours to get everything done.
   The only problem I had was getting the air filter closed once I replaced the air filter. And that was solved by having my wife snap the clips shut, since her hands are substantionally smaller than mine. But thats the only reason I couldn't close it.
   The car passed the emissions test here in Wisconsin in a matter of seconds. 
   The sound system is great, and that's factory. It has two speakers in the rear, two built in the doors, and two small ones near the top of the door. It has a CD player that doesn't skip. It can be quite loud,just the way my wife likes it.
