            This is probably the best looking car in its class. I bought this car two month ago, for I was impressed by its design and handling, and I wanted something different from Honda and Toyota. HOWEVER, PLEASE BE NOT DECEIVED BY ITS DESIGN!!! 
This car is the worst I've every bought. Let me tell you 
the reasons. I was a mechanic in army, so I'm very aware of
cars. Mazda protege originally has an idle problem, which 
Mazda has refused to acknowledge. Whenever I stop my car, 
I feel such an uneven idle, I think, from engine or combustion chamber. If you don't know about car you will not
see this problem. Mazda service center and I have tried to
fix it for 2 months, but we couldn't. Finally, now we are
trying to replace ERG valve. Mazda said all Mazda products
have the ERG valve problem. They said themselves Mazda is notorious for its idle problem. So,then, what can you predict next? Naturally, the car's acceleration is horrible, which today everybody knows. Mazda invented a new ERG valve a few years ago, but it doesn't work at all. They are going to use a new valve system in the following protege(in fact, protege will vanish) Mazda 3. 
And the car is too stiff even though the handling is great. This is weird. The noise the car causes is unbearable. I give it up. Even the car seriously squeaks whenever I get in the car. I doubt if it's a really japan-made car. Some lubricate job is useless. Do not try to fix it. 
The automatic transmission is just awful. The trans. is that
of Ford. Not smooth and agile. Very rough. 
The exhaust system is more horrible. I see the black gas clog everyday in the tailpipe. 
Do not expect any good riding quality. I know it's a small sedan, but I know Civic and Corolla is better. 
Even the stereo system is not good. Everyday I ask myself, "Why did I buy this car?" I can't find any good thing in this car except for its exterior and interior design. 
Please do not buy this car. But if you are not sensitive in
detecting car problems, you can buy this car. Sometimes 
appearance is more important than performance as we look at
girls. Human tragedy. 
I'm going to give this car to the son of the service center manager. Yesterday, I riped up the Mazda service center survey form in front of the manager: it says, "Mazda is famous for its quality... you must be satisfied with the car and service.... we are doing our best....... our service center was ranked #1 in the last year.... the customer is our pride...."
Lastly, the gas economy is also awful. I owned Honda Civic before this car. 
Sorry to Mazda company.... At least, the name and logo are 
beautiful....
