            I bought this car as my first car..with 98,000 miles on it in 1998.  I must say for bein' 8 years old and having higher milage..the original paint job..still looked great..other then a very minor amount of rust at the bottoms of the doors..which wasn't even noticeable..and not all the wya through the metal.  The interior still looked new..and engine still looked clean as a whistle.  I'm very impressed at the quality of these cars, they really last.  I kept the car until 120,000 miles and never was stranded or had a major problem with it...very reliable!  I seemed to have mostly problems with pumps on the car while having it..i replaced the water, power steering and fuel pumps and also the alternator (which may of been fryed by my huge stereo system).  When ever i had guests in the car, they were suprised by how spacious the interior is.  I had the Lumina euro..which has larger alloy wheels..different suspension and spoiler - gave the car a very sporty look.  The V6 had very good power, and the transmission never had a problem.<br><br>
