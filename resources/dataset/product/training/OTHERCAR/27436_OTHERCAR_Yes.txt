            The Dodge Neon is a great little car, for being a compact car I was impressed that I was able to load such a great amount of things into it with the help of the ability to lower the back seats to be able to connect the trunk and the back seat into one compartment.  It has been dependable and no maintenance required with over 70,000 miles.  The only problem is the paint, which is flaking on the back, which should require little expense to repair.  I would highly recommend this car for anyone interested in a compact car. Personally I am over 6 foot tall and over 240 pounds yet it is comfortable to drive for long distances.
Great Car
