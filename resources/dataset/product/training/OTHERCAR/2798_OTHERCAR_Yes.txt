            Last summer I was on a ski trip where I took a tumble.  Fortunately I was ok, my trusty old Olympus point-and-shoot was not.  So a few months ago, I was getting my gear ready for climbing trip to the Grand Tetons in Wyoming, when I realized I didn't have a camera.  What to do?!?

After scouring the internet for information, reading every review I could, and mulling over all the specs for half a dozen cameras, I finally ended up with the Olympus D-400 Zoom.  Not only was it fairly compact (and would fit nicely in my coat pocket), but it was also pretty light (I think at around 9 ozs.)  In addition, I could get a 32mb RAM card which would allow me to take almost 500 pictures (in the lowest quality setting)!  Wow... looks like I won't be needing film.

So how did it perform?  Not too shabby.  I carried the camera everywhere and was able to take some great photos.  As expected, the lowest quality pics tend to get kinda of blurry when you blow them up.  The highest quality pics look *really* nice.  The zoom also came in handy when I couldn't really &quot;take another step back&quot; to frame the perfect shot when I was on the summit of the Grand.  Using the 32mb card (I purchased that seperately for $90), I took 250 pictures on my vacation of which 50% were low quality and the other 50% high quality.

What sucked?  For one thing, the camera chews up batteries like crazy.  Fortunately, I had rechargeables with me but it would *really* suck if you were in the middle of the special moment and the camera kicked out.  Also the camera seemed to respond more slowly when it got colder outside.  Even though it was around 40 degrees F, I had to really concentrate to hold still while the camera took the picture.  My last little gripe is that the camera is not real intuitive and I screwed up a couple photos when I had the incorrect settings.  But perhaps that is a user training issue.<br><br>
