            In 1994, my husband and I lived in Germany, thanks to the US Air Force.  We made the conscious decision at that time to buy a new, European, quality vehicle that would be my primary mode of transportation for a very long time to come.  It was the end of the European model year and the prices were set to sell!!!  After carefully considering the options available, the insurance &quot;risk&quot;, and our personal preferences, we decided on the Volvo 850 with an optional spoiler added. In addition, Volvo has several other EXCELLENT programs available to the American service member buying overseas that made our purchase unbeatable.  This car would have cost us MUCH more, stateside, and they shipped it back to the USA for us free when it was time to move back home. 

I cannot say enough how much I love this car.  Our &quot;Volvolition&quot; was the best automotive choice we ever made.  The automatic transmission has two settings (on the fly)-a Sport setting that allows that extra get-up-and-go you just sometimes &quot;need&quot;, and a more Economical 'Economy' setting that performs very well for the majority of the time.  There is also a 'Winter' setting that has been invaluable, from the icy Alps to the Plains of Nebraska and the Snowy Peaks of the Rockies, this baby really outperforms any other sedan I have ever driven, regardless of the weather.  The standard warranty is incredible on a new Volvo, and the few minor bumps we encountered were ALWAYS covered by warranty, mostly superficial and minor enough to be settled during routine maintenance appointments.

We now have two young children, and the back seat is ample enough to accommodate a booster seat and a regular car seat, as well as an adult passenger, with no problem.  The best part is, Volvo no longer has that stereotypical &quot;boxy&quot; styling, so I can even pretend to be driving a sporty car instead of what we affectionately call my &quot;tank with a leather interior&quot;.  I told my husband that once it is time to pass this car on to our three year old daughter as her first vehicle, I am not gonna settle for anything short of another Volvo!  For those searching for a good, quality new or used car, I highly recommend a Volvo!<br><br>
