            I still like the looks of my car, but that�s about all I still like about the car.

Problems experienced :
- car doesn�t always start (still not fixed)
- right front tyre wears out from the inside.
- oil leaking from the transmission
- power steering pump broke (took more than a week to fix it)
- consumes about 1 liter of oil on 5000km (dealer doesn�t find problem)
- very high fuel consumption for a 1.5 (9.5 liters on 100km)
- trunk lock broken

Untill now everything except the broken lock was fixed under warranty (if it was fixed), but I am really afraid what happens when the warranty expires. It will be an expensive drive<br><br>
