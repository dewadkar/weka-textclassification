            I have had my Jeep for five years now.  I haven't had any major problems with it.  The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have dual airbags.  It is a fun car to drive.  It is reliable, and it is always nice to know that you won't get stuck at home when it snows with a jeep around.  I have watched those things on TV where they say which cars are the safest.  Supposedly, the jeep is in the middle.  According to them, it tips easily.  If I could afford a Mercedes or a Lexus, I would go for one of those two.  They are the safest.  But the Jeep is the best suv in its price range.<br><br>
