            The 2001 Nissan XTerra is the second car I have ever owned, and I must say that if there was ever a car I would consider fathering children with, this would be the one.  I love this car.  Nissan's design team went to town making this a functional automobile, with features like stadium seating that gives backseat passengers a clear view of the road ahead, a built in first aid kit, a standard cargo basket on the roof for things like wet boots and children, backseat cupholders and many more details that make you say "why would I buy any other SUV that is in this price range?"  The most popular colors for this car seem to be black, silver, and taxi-cab yellow.  I opted for the black exterior, and even after brushes with trees and other cars and MAYBE a pedestrian or two (my lawyer informs me I have to inform you that was a joke) I have not witnessed any scratching of the paint.  The XTerra drives like most other SUV's, although it has an excellent turning radius, which rivals that of most sedans.  My only complaint is there isn't a lot of power in acceleration, but if you're drag racing an XTerra perhaps you shouldn't be driving one in the first place.  The cargo space in the rear is very roomy, and the back seats fold down for extra space, although the cushions must be removed and placed somewhere if you want to fold them all the way down.  I would reccomend this car to anyone with a drivers license or a fake drivers license, or anyone who can get ahold of one.
