            great looking,unreal power with the new engine,great looks,good fuel mileage,and the convertible is the ultimate date getter-on the other hand,the maintenance is costly, the repairs even more so-Mits has straightened out some of their problems but not all-the engine still ticks loudly at start up and oil leaks seem to start as soon as the engine gets 500 miles on it-poor gaskets and no quality control? Maybe!
LISTEN PEOPLE!!! Change your oil every 3000 miles,its cheap insurance ($20)-how many times have I seen a new car with 12,000 miles on it and the oil and filter have not been changed,also is usually 1-2 qts low-note: new engines burn more oil than a broken in engine,and all engines burn oil to operate,remember this!!-overall it a good little car with poor resale value after 3-4 years but who cares!-keep it,drive it and look good!!<br><br>
