            This is a epinion to try to get everyone to avoid the 1996 Chrysler minivans (Im not sure what the 1997 and newer ones are like).  I bought a 1996 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE with the 3.3 V6 in it,  it only had about 30 miles on it when I bought it and I got a great deal for it.  It was a beautiful minivan at the time,  I loved the way it looked and it had quite a bit of power.  Then came the onset of problems.  The first problem started happening since the first week I had it,  the ever so popular drivers sliding door refused to open.  I took it to the dealer within 2 weeks of purchase,  they replaced the latch and it seemed to be fixed.  Well it just kept "breaking".  I took it to a dealer 3 times to get it fixed but it never was.  This isnt all.  I took my van to the dealer a total of 28 times in 2 years (for unscheduled repairs).  Some of the major repairs (mostly done under warranty thank god):  The engine had to be rebuilt at 24,000 miles,  the gas tank had to be replaced at about 18,000 miles because it was warped (it could only hold like 11 gallons) and it was leaking. The rear hatch lock rusted out at about 40k miles and I attempted to get it replaced twice (the hatch still wouldnt open when I sold it).  There were numerous brake problems,  numerous serpentine belt problem,  the a/c never worked.   Overall I was very unhappy with this minivan,  but I pretty much became a good friend of everyone at the dealer and they gave me a very nice trade in on it.  I will never buy a Chrysler minivan again and personally they should have spent alittle more time getting the van right the first time.
