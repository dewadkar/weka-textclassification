            I bought the 2.5S w/floor mats, in-cabin microfilter, mudguards, and the auto-dimming mirror with outside temperature and compass (important to have).  I was annoyed because I did not want any of these extra items, but Nissan has set it up so that they ship the majority of the standard 2.5S models with these features.  Combined they add $340 (invoice) to the price of the car.

I bought a 5-speed in Mystic Emerald with the Blond interior.  I went with the Blond interior because it makes the cabin feel more spacious, and it looked nicer to me with the black steering wheel, shifter, and parking brake contrasting with the lighter colored elements.  Plus the CRX I traded in had a dark interior and I wanted a change.  While I love the color scheme, the longer I look at the plastic door panels the less crazy I am about the �s�-brown color.  Still, the fabric colors are nice so I�m happy with my choice.

I paid $17,015 plus destination ($540) and advertising fees of $305 for a grand total (before taxes) of $17,860.  This compares to the MSRP of $19,327.  I basically paid $125 over invoice (including destination and advertising fees, not including any trade-in) which equates to 0.70% over invoice.  I think I got a pretty good deal considering they had to find the car I wanted and bring it back to their dealership.

I have had the car for almost two weeks and 800mi now.  I am very impressed with the quite interior.  Very little road noise makes it in (a bit more is noticeable over rough pavement) and wind noise is virtually non-existent.  The stock stereo is very good; the mid-range adjustment is nice.  There is plenty of base for me (though I would like more treble).  Digitally recorded CD�s sound better than the FM stereo.

Many people have voiced negative comments about the quality of the interior.  I have to say I agree with this, though I obviously don�t believe it should be a showstopper (since I bought the car).  You are getting a lot in the car for the money you are spending (great suspension, 16� wheels, 4-wheel disc brakes, keyless entry, auto-up drivers window (need I go on?).  While I think it is unfortunate that they had to �make ends meet� by cutting corners on the interior, there are many other areas where they could have cut corners that would have completely ruined this car.  All in all, I can live with an interior that is not quite as refined as a $30K car if the performance and reliability are still equivalent to that same $30K car. 

I will take a minute to air a few gripes about the interior that I have not already read somewhere else, just to provide more info to people who are shopping for a car.

	1.	The carpeting in the back seat is not tucked all the way down to the floor pan on the driver�s side.  If you step here when getting in or out of the car it gives way and makes a plastic rumpling sound.  I don�t know how this would hold up if you stepped on it frequently.
	2.	The speedometer seems to read high.  I have read this before but I wanted to let people know I have noticed the same thing.  In my old car I was always travelling about 70 mph to keep up with traffic.  Now it seems that I am travelling 75mph.  I�m not sure what to make of it, but there it is.
        3.      The seats seem to be a bit uncomfortable.  I have been playing with the adjustments since I bought the car and can't seem to find a comfortable position.
	4.	MY CLUTCH LEVER SQUEEKS WHEN DEPRESSED OR LET OUT!

		HUGE annoyance.  If anyone else has had this problem and a dealer was able to correct it please let me know�

As far as performance goes I have been happy so far.  The 4 cylinder (@ 175HP) has most of the power I could want, and most of the fuel-economy I was looking for.  I think this was a good trade-off.  I commute 70+ miles every day so I didn�t want the mpg debit of the V6, but with 175HP there is still plenty of passing and hill climbing power in the 4.  The clutch and shifter feel pretty good, aside from being a bit notchy in first and second gears.  I had to adjust to the feel of the clutch (very light) compared to the gorilla spring in my CRX.  But I am getting used to it.

The car looks great and rides great.  I looked at the new Camry before I bought this.  The perceived reliability and slightly better fuel efficiency of the Camry were at odds with its humdrum interior and only slightly better exterior styling.  In the end the only thing holding me back from the Altima was the interior, but the more I test drove it the more the interior grew on me.  I feel I made the right choice.
