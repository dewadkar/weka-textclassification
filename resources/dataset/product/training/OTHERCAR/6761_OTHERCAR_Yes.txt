            We purchased our Santa Fe on May 6 2001. After checking out all other makes of small SUVs, we found the Santa Fe to be the best buy. For under $20,000 you get all the goodies that other makes of similar size and options want $24,000 for. The factory warranty is unbeatable. Ten year, 100,000 mile drive train, and 5 year 50,000 mile bumper to bumper extendable to ten year, 100,000 miles. We elected to get the 4 cyl. version because my wife seldom gets off the city streets. We drove our Santa Fe to a local Indian casino here in San Diego which took us up into the mountains. The 4cyl, with the A/C on full, struggled to get up the hills. I wondered what would happen if we had two other people and luggage on top. I could vision ourselves rolling backward down the hill with the pedal to the floor. On the straight open road, our little SUV did wonderful. Some low wind noise was noted from the luggage rack cross bars, but not too annoying. The seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room for my 6'2'' 225lb body. The cruise control was smooth and easy to set. The sound system with CD/cassette stereo combo was excellent. It's handling of the high winds in the San Diego mountain areas were virtually unnoticeable. I had some reservations about the transmission not having overdrive when we bought the car. On the open freeway cruising along at 70 mph, taking your foot off the gas results in fast deceleration, much like a stick shift without using the clutch. I have walked all around this car 100 times or more trying to find some kind of manufacture's defect,or plain and simple sloppy workmanship. I have not found a thing yet, visually that is. My wife now has about 425 miles on it, and she calls me at work from her cell phone to tell me that the engine died while she was going down the road at 35 mph. She was able to get it started after muscling it off the road. She drove it to her mother's house were I met her. We called the dealer who offered to have it towed and deliver a loaner car to us. We elected to drive it to the dealership. It died one more time while I was driving it, and my son-in-law following us to the dealership. My wife felt vindicated knowing that someone else experienced the same problem. The service manager met us at the dealership and immediately had two mechanics checking it out. The hand held analysis computer found a problem right away. The dealer gave us a loaner car, not a cheapy jeepy but a brand new luxurious Q300 to drive home. We are not to concerned about the engine problem, these things can happen to any new car. It's the customer service that can make these things become a nightmare. Our Hyundai dealer has earned our confidence, and we feel that the customer service and support has been excellent. We recommend to anyone who is looking for a small SUV, test drive the Hyundai Santa Fe last. You'll be impressed with it's comparison to other makes.
