Picking up vehicles and transporting them for our local Ford Dealer has given me the chance to try out several different models. This is very valuable when I am looking to purchase a car for myself.

Yesterday I had the opportunity to drive a 2000 Mercury Villager. The dealership I picked it up at was well over a hundred miles from home, so I was able to learn a lot about the performance of the van.

The standard options on the van include3.3L V-6 SOHC sequential -port electronic fuel injection engine. Now that doesn't tell ME a whole lot, but I can tell you from my experience that this van has plenty of power when you need it. Want a quick burst of speed? Gently depress the accelerator and you've got it!

The van features power rack and pinion steering. It has a tilt lever for the steering column. I really enjoy being able to set the steering wheel at a comfortable angle for me.

I love the way it handles.  It seems to hug the road and zooms easily around curves. The one thing I didn't like about my beloved Grand Marquis was the fact I always felt I was losing control of it on curves and would slow down because of this. I did not get this sensation with the Villager.

This seven passenger van is nice and roomy with ample storage space, including a drawer under the passenger seat.

I liked the easy accessibility of the controls on the dash panel. It was quite easy to reach the controls of the radio/tape player, which is important to me. Also you can quickly adjust the climate controls.

I had difficulty in locating the power switch for the cruise control. It is located at the bottom left side of the dash board. All the other controls for the cruise are conveniently located on the left side of the steering wheel, allowing for one touch operation.

I liked the safety feature this van has of a child-proof lock on the sliding
door. The seat belts are easy to use and are color keyed.

The front seats are bucket seats while the second and third row are bench seats. You can easily get to all of the seats, even the third row.

Another nice feature of the van is the defogger for the front windows.

I highly recommend this van for family use or for anyone who has a need for extra passenger space.

We have been considering purchasing a van ourselves. When, and if, we decide to do so, the Mercury Villager will be at the top of our list of prospective vehicles.
