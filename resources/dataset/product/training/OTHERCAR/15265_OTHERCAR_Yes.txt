            Joining the Internet Gold Rush in April 1999, I developed a commercial web site designed to promote the inventory of local &quot;Bricks and Mortar&quot; retailers.    In order to be effective it would be essential to portray each item graphically and thus, my Sony Mavica became my partner.   I must admit that at first I was very impressed with this new technology.   I must interject that at this time my experience with any type of camera was limited to a point and click snap taker.   
The first feature that I found to be essential was the ability to use diskettes.   I would sometimes take as many as 150 to 250 shots a day.   I do not know of any other that would be able to do this without uploading to the computer.   Naturally, the additional battery came in useful on these occasions.   The camera has another significant feature although I seldom use it, that being the sound/video ability.   Itï¿½s surprising how much one can get in 60 seconds.   One of my first accessories was macro lens that enabled me to produce remarkable images of fine jewelry.   Over the course of the past eight months, I have probably captured some five to ten thousand images.   The freedom of film and processing costs allowed me to shoot everything and anything without impunity.   The result as you might expect is that now my photographic ability has expanded one hundred fold.   Photography, when one can produce satisfying results, truly is a fun and rewarding hobby or occupation.   Thanks to this technology, I would venture to say that I have learned something approaching the &quot;Art&quot; of photography.   I have read no books, taken no lessons and definitely had no talent prior to April 1999.
My only criticism is the shutter response time, which can appear very slow when one is attempting to capture an action, shot.
My contention is that a Sony Digital Camera is essential for anyone wanting to become an accomplished hobbyist or even professional photographer.
I should also add that the camera is extremely robust.   I do not treat it with the care that I should but so far, so good.
