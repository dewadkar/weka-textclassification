            Anyone considering a digital camera should read the excellent reviews in epinions first.  This "review" is just a footnote to those.  

I bought this for my daughter after buying last-year's model last year for my other daughter, the A40.  Both have been good, dependable cameras.  Both of my teen-age daughters use their camera to make photos on-line and the occasional print, what many teens seem to do.  We like this camera because it is big enough to hold comfortably.  It feels like a camera.  We got our fingers in the picture with our small camera.  For us, a larger size is important.  

When buying a camera don't forget to budget about $100 for essential accessories: an extra compact flash card, NiMH batteries, a case, and a card reader for your computer.   Think carefully about how much you will use the camera.  For light use, alkaline batteries are a good choice.  NiMH batteries cost at least $50 while alkalines cost about $5.00 per set and seem to last long enough.  Budget for the NiMH but hold off until you find you need them. 

The camera works well reading directly into Canon's new printers.  There are limitations to this (you can't edit much) but you can get a print quickly at home.  It has been handy a few times but if you have friends over, for example, it's a great idea.  The Canon printers are excellent. 

The quality of 4x6 prints is superb for an amateur camera.  

No camera in this range has a hot shoe for a heavy-duty flash, something I wish this type of camera had.  You need a small case when carrying the camera around.
