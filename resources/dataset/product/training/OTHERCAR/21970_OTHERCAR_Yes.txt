            I purchased my 1986 Mazda RX-7SE 5-spd back in 1995 with only 50K miles.  It's appearance (despite faded paint job) was sporty sleek and irresistible.  I've owned and driven the car since then and it's reliable is remarkable!  This is the best/most reliable car I've ever owned.  The few repairs I've made were: new radiator hoes (no leaks.. just precautionary), four new tires (it's a sports car, they go through tires faster), a new clutch (I replaced the original factory because it suffered from metal fatigue in 98), replaced a brake caliper (in 96) this is in addition to religious oil changes every 3000 miles and yearly tuneups.  The car has cost me less than $1300 in repairs in five years.  I hope my next car is as reliable as my RX-7 (should be, it'll be a 2001 Celica).  I recommend the RX-7!!  My only reservation to purchasing a RX-7 (just like any sports car) is to inspect it thoroughly because reliability will suffer (and cost major $$$) if the car was owned by a hot rodder (modifications=speed=worn parts which could lead to cars that were wrecked and pieced together)<br><br>
