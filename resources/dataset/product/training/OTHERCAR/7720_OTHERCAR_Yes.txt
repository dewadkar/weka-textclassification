            I admit it i went with the craze.  Texas is known for loving the SUV's.  Myself, being a Texan, admit to following the heard and loving everything about my Tahoe.  My job requires a lot of travel sometimes up to seven to eight hundred miles a week traveling from client to client.  I am by trade a fisheries biologist working for myself to make enough to live on i am forced to travel.  My job also requires me to tow a boat and with pride my Tahoe openly accepts any condition that i throw at it; in fact at the start of this past weekend we had almost two days of rain and i was out in East Texas working with a client who has several lakes on their property two of which are not easy to get to.  My Tahoe pull me, my new found friend and and my boat through some pretty deep mud pits let me launch the boat do my thing and then take me all the way back to Dallas with out even complaining.  So needless to say this truck is tough.  Other aspects that the Tahoe gives is being roomy and comfortable.  This car will seat five easily and all the luggage they can bring. the driver and passenger seats have heaters which my wife never turns off.  Over all i know i will own another Tahoe.  Call me a sucker if you want but for me Chevrolet has made the SUV to own for the start of the century.      <br><br>
