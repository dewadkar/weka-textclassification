            My wife and I loved her 1997 Toyota 4Runner.  We liked having a vehicle that could haul the family around and still carry things back from Home Depot.  The truck was a blast.  Unfortunately, it sat high off the ground (hard to get in), and drank fuel.  The ride also left much to be desired.

We looked long and hard before purchasing a new 2000 Volvo V70 SE.  The Special Edition model comes with leather, a trip computer, memory seats (wonderful because my wife is much shorter than me), and Homelink (garage door openers).  We have the base engine with about 168 hp.

My wife loves the Volvo.  It has plenty of power (for her) and she is getting about 22 mpg in mixed driving.  She enjoys loading our son in the car seat without having to lift him three feet up into the truck.  The wagon trunk swallows strollers, playpens, even large boxes with ease.  The seats are to die for and the ride is relatively smooth.

Driving the Volvo is nice.  You can tell it is front-wheel-drive but the steering wheel doesn't pull like some cars (torque steer).  The handling is good, and the car won't get you into trouble (plenty of understeer).  Brakes are superb.  The car turns on a dime.  It could use some more power, but the new 5-speed automatic is very smooth and aids acceleration at lower speeds (better gear ratios).

LIKES: All-around utility.  Plenty of storage areas.  Visibility out the windows.  Seats are comfortable.  Nice ride. Fuel economy is good.  Climate control is very strong. Stereo sounds clean and realistic.

DISLIKES: Dusty brakes (dirty wheels immediately after washing).  No standard cargo cover. No standard roof rack. Price is steep (dealers will discount). <br><br>
