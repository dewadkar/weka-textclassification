            This product is great. I sold my first Kodak DC120 to a friend and replaced it with the DC280. No regrets. The camera lives up to it's billing. many built in features, direct hookup to your TV, built in borders, and many more options. Reset time is good. I recommend an extra flash card if you shoot a lot of photo's. This is a great middle of the road camera that will do everything a new photographer wants, and a lot that a professional will want. The price is the same from Kodak on the web, as it is in a store. There are a lot of manual settings that you can do also.<br><br>
