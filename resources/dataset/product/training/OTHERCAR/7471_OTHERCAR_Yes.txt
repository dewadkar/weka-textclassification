            There is a great car out there if you are looking right now to buy a good 4 door car. Grand Am SE 2000 is the way to go I think. I bought one 3 months ago and it has been nothing but fun for me. 
It is very powerful gets up and moves very quickly. Pretty roomey inside. Could be a little bit better but not bad at all. Love the body style very 2000's style.
I was also impressed it was to handle this car. Rides very smooth and just is a all around great car. For the price why not get one?
We looked forever the day we were looking and when that Grand Am SE caught my eye I had to test drive it and then after that it was all over!
Another neat thing is everything is computer in this car. If you need a oil change it will tell you. If your engine needs service it will tell you. Your headlights turn on and off without you having to push anything at all.
Check this car out. I love mine.
Thanks........<br><br>
