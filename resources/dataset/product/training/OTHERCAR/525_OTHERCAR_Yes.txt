            The C2100UZ is my second digital camera. I previously owned a Kodak 260.
My experience with digital cameras was positive but i was frustrated by two things- 1)Zoom wasn't powerful enough 2)and the time delay between pictures was slow especially when taking higher resolution shots. The Olympus C2100UZ promised to remedy both of those issues.
 I have been using the camera for a couple of weeks and it has proven to be just what i was looking for. The 10X zoom is incredible and even the digital zoom performs better than I expected. The 16MB memory lets you take pictures in rapid succession without delay.
This is a quality camera that feels more like a 35MM than a digital. It has great flexibility but it is easy to use. I like the quick settings for portrait, sports, and night shooting. I have had great success shooting at night without flash. Also, the portrait setting automatically sets controls to give you a sharp portrait with a blurred background- something I could not do with the Kodak.
Instruction manual is thorough and easy to understand.
I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants a strong zoom and the flexibility of both an automatic camera and one you can manually control.
Can't find anything to hate about this product. The 2.1 megapixel resolution provides great 8X10 prints with my HP printer.
Shop around and you can get this camera well below the list price. 

********Update!!!

Just back from Hawaii where I put this camera to an extensive test and wanted to share my experience with you. 
I still highly recommend this camera for the above reasons- the zoom is amazing! It provided great flexibility in composing shots. A note of caution: While the image stabilizer that comes with the camera does a good job eliminating blurred pictures you do have to work to hold the camera steady at full zoom especially in low light situations.
I was extremely impressed with the results from the night setting- available light produced very clear pictures that allowed for some real creativity. Note: need to really hold the camera steady or use a tripod when using the night setting at full zoom.
I shot over 300 pictures (Hawaii can do that to you) and found I only had to charge the batteries twice. You will run the batteries down more often if you are using the LCD viewer to show off your work.
The quality of the pictures was excellent. I used the HQ setting for all shots and this allowed me to get 148 shots on a 64MB Smartmedia card. I have used my HP 970 printer to print several 8X10 photos from these pictures and the results are outstanding! Definitely photo lab quality.
On the negative side- I found that some of the pictures taken on the water took on a slight bluish cast that can be corrected in a photo editing program. Also, found that in some lighting conditions pictures seemed somewhat underexposed. When this was the case I used the Olympus Camedia program's "instant fix" tool to adjust the pictures and they instantly looked much better.
My wife took her Minolta 35mm camera along and took some great shots with it. However, one roll came back screwed up from developing- happened to be some of her favorite shots. This is one major reason i would go with digital almost every time. It is really hard to screw up your digital pictures and even when you find them less than perfect you can correct them on your computer with very little knowledge or effort.
This is a fun camera!! Very satisfied with the results.
