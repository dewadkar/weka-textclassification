            I bought this car because of the color and price.  These cars come in some of the funkiest colors.  Mine is purple.  It drive like any other compact with a little pep.  Not the quietest car in the world, but not bad.
If you are looking for a car that is inexpensive, but very reliable this is the car.  I own a &quot;93&quot; Impreza and the only thing I have had to do is change the oil.  I used to live in the north at high altitude and it did not due as well with gas mileage, but now I live in the South and the car gets almost 40 miles to the gallon here.  
My only fall back is the placement of the cup holders they are in front of the stereo and they can only fit a certain size cup.
But if you are a student on a budget and you want a nice looking affordable car this is definitely the one to take a closer look at.<br><br>
