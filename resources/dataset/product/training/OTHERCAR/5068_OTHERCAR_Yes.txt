            For all those new digital camera users, I can honestly say I'm pleased with my purchase.  It was certainly worth the investment.

After charging the battery, I was off and running.  I found reading the instructions a bit confusing and the actual usage of the camera more enlightening.

It includes many interesting features.  The small preview screen helps with capturing just the right picture.  It does, however, get dusty and fingerprints rather easily.  Thus, I'm constantly cleaning it.  

The zoom, flash, and picture effect choices are fun.  I especially like the black and white photo option.  I can usually take around 23 pictures in the Fine Mode.  Although the regular mode allows for more pictures, I want to achieve the highest quality picture possible.  Thus, I keep the camera set on the Fine Mode.  

I really like the play feature, where you can see your photos on the preview screen individually.  I can easily locate a certain picture with the index option.  With a few little steps I can delete any picture I don't wish to keep before I load the diskette onto my computer.  It's great for those less than perfect shots.  When I physically move and the picture is less than perfect, I do get frustrated with the lag time on the shutter.  It seems a bit lengthy to me.  

The 3.5 diskette format works easily with uploading the photos to my computer.  The combination of all the features makes it versatile and easy to use.
