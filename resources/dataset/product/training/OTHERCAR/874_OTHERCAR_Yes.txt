            It was hard getting this camera, but was it ever worth the wait.  With a few exceptions, this camera has performed well beyond my expectations, even besting my film camera in side-by-side comparisons.

First of all, a cautionary note about buying online from electronics stores based in New York, (and other cities as well - I'm sure).  These online/mail order stores cut their profit margins to the bone, knowing that you are comparing their prices against all of their competition and that you will probably buy from whoever has it the cheapest.  To cut prices that drastically, the stores need to make their profit back somehow.  Many times, they will sell "gray market" items which are mostly the same as the ones sold in the U.S., but seldom come with the accessories you are supposed to get and are often not covered under any type of warranty.  In other words, the electronics shop will be responsible for handling any repairs needed and that's not a good idea!

To cut a long story short, I ended up buying my camera in Los Angeles when I was there on vacation in Summer 2000.  I was able to use the camera right out of the box without reading any instructions.  I had done a lot of research before choosing this camera, so I was aware of what it was supposed to do.  Later I found that it did a whole lot more than I'd anticipated.

The image quality of this camera is second to none, (in it's resolution range).  The colors, sharpness, automatic exposure, all very accurate.  I've read technical reviews of the lens system and CCD and those very technical reviewers were impressed too!

There aren't many shortcomings of this camera, but here they are.  In extremely low light situations your images will have a lot of noise in the form of brightly colored pixels against the black background.  I've noticed that the problem is especially noticeable when the batteries are low.  

That's the other problem... Batteries don't seem to last very long in this camera.  To be fair, I do use the LCD screen most of the time and I often use the flash too.  One way I combat this problem is by using rechargeable batteries.  I always change the batteries for a freshly charged set when I leave the house, and I have a fresh set in the bag just in case.  I found a charger at Radio Shack that does 8 batteries at a time so I can always have two sets ready to go.  Also, the batteries I use are by Panasonic and they seem to be consistent across multiple chargings.  For all I know, all of the Mega-Megapixel cameras go through batteries like that.
