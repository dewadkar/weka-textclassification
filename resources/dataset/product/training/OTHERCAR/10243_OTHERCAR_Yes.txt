                    I just purchased the Lexus RX 300 last year.  We bought this vehicle because of the interior and the lexus name.  We already own a Lexus LS 400.  This car is well worth the price.  This car is a few thousand cheaper than the competitive models by Mercedes, Lincoln, Cadillac, and BMW.  It gets better mileage than all of these, plus it will last a lot longer because it is made by Lexus.  
        The drive is extremely smooth.  We have fit five adults in here comfortably and the reclining feature of the backseat makes it a Laz-Boy.  The ride and the drive is great.  The trunk is of perfect size for a small family.  This car makes sense for a family looking for a cheap, reliable small car.  
         This car is built on the chasis of the Camry and ES 300, so it makes it an easy drive.  The turn radius is not as good as the ML 320, but the ride is much better.  The interior of the car is just beautiful.  The exterior is not to my liking, but if you like the exterior this car will be the perfect choice for you.  The interior computer/ monitor is a bit showy, but it is a great gadget to play with.  Also, if your going to buy a luxury SUV, then spend the extra money for the chrome rims just because it is worth the money.  Also, if you take long trips this car will be the best fit.  It is comfortable, smooth ride.  
         My advice is test drive all these models and then test drive the RX.  I guarantee you will see the difference.
