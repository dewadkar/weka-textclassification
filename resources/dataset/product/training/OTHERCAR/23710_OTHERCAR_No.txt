            My wife and I heard a promotion on the radio - two 2003 Spectras for the price of one.  It was a Sunday and the dealership with this promotion was closed, so we visited another Kia dealership who told us they could make a similar offer.  My wife and I liked the look of the Spectras and decided to buy two if they could make us a good offer.  It turns out our 2002 Optima trade-in was only worth $10,275 (poor resale value!), but we owed $13,400, so they had to play games and inflate the price of one Spectra to make a deal.  The bonuses offered only amounted to $3500 per vehicle, far less than a "two-for-one" offer.  Unfortunately my wife and I were hypnotized by the energy of the dealership and the idea of new cars, and I was enticed by the idea of better fuel economy than the Optima and my 1989 Pontiac Grand Am. I reasoned - smaller car, wimpier engine - better mileage, right?  Wrong!  We were sold an LS model automatic and the base model 5-speed.  We wanted two 5-speeds, but they only had one.

In three weeks and 1200 miles of use, the automatic consistently gets 23.5 MPG on my back road commute with sedate driving.  For comparison, the Optima used to get 25 MPG on the same trip, without such a light foot.  My Grand Am got 25-27 MPG on this commute. 

On the highway, the automatic Spectra could only manage 27.5 MPG, a shameful figure for such an underpowered small car.  The Optima would get 32 MPG on the highway, as would the Grand Am!

In contrast to the automatic, the 5-speed is a pleasure to drive.  On hills that the automatic needs to shift down to 2nd gear to ascend, the 5-speed can pull in 4th gear with no problem.  Acceleration is peppy on the 5-speed, while the automatic has a brief surge off the line and has poor acceleration thereafter.  The fuel economy is where the 5-speed really shines.  My commute, with air conditioning and no babying, gets me 35 MPG!  The 5-speed is a no brainer, I am trying to turn in the automatic for either a 5-speed or my old Optima.  Avoid the automatic.  If you can't drive a stick, go for a different make, perhaps the sister car the Hyundai Elantra, which has a larger engine and better performance in fuel economy and power.
