            The Toyota previa was one of the best minivans ever put on the market.  The packing space in the back is epitomized by the lift up back seats (takes about two minutes).  The ride is comfy and luxury as a minivan can be.  The two front seats feel like you are in the cabin of the starship eneterprize, basically all features wrap around the front two captains chairs.  The stereo is not the best but that really isn't a problem for those big time music buffs who enjoy having their own custom music anyway.  The engine lasts forever...Just make sure you have enough antifreeze because the engine block cracks rather easily under extreme temperatures.<br><br>
