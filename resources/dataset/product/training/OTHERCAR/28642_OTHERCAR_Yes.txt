            I've used this camera for more than a year now, and overall I'm happy with it. 

What I like: 

The image quality is really quite good. I actually bought it to email pictures back to Europe, but it now completely replaces my old camera, as reprints (which I order via Ofoto.com and ezprints.com) are of excellent quality. Optimal results with different light-conditions, realistic colors.
You can get a pretty good impression of the final picture on the LCD color screen on the back, that you can also use as a video-like preview screen (real motion!) to point the camera.
Documentation and software are excellent, and the general impression of the device is one of high quality, except for the plastic lens-cover, which broke almost immediately.


What I don't like:

You should carry it in a bag, as it is not small enough to put it in a pocket, and it is rather heavy, due to the 4 batteries. And you should bring a spare set of those as well, as it seams to suck life out of them as fast as a body-snatcher. This said, it is surprising that Kodak did not deliver a small bag with it, for one because the lens-cover really is inadequate, and also because you probably need to carry a spare set of batteries and maybe a second flash-memory card.
The serial connection is too slow to transfer the files to the computer. Actually, the camera shuts itself off (power-off) before the whole 4 Mb are transferred. Consider investing in a USB card-reader, like that from Sandisk, which cost me about 50$. But it's worth it.
Oh, and there is quite a long lag-time between two pictures, I believe it is in the 5 seconds range.


Overall I think that the pro's largely outweigh the con's. It is impressive to see how the camera adjusts itself to different light-conditions, and how realistic the colors are. I recommend it.<br><br>
