              When I met my wife, she was driving a 92 Acura Integra hatchback.  I had never owned an Acura and knew nothing about them, except that they were made by Honda and were more expensive.

  The first time I drove the vehicle, we were heading across town to go to the movies.  I saw the light ahead of me turn yellow, so I decided to &quot;beat&quot; the light.  I mashed the accelerator to the floor and was <i>shocked as the engine roared, tachometer spun up to 7000 rpm, and slammed me into my seat</i>.  Giving my wife a crazed look, I asked &quot;Does this car always do that?&quot;. She gave a casual, nonchalant reply &quot;Yes, but I don't drive like that very often&quot;. 

  So after the movie I was looking for any excuse to floor the accelerator.  After we got married, she took the keys to my 98 Honda Accord EX and gave me the keys to the Acura.  I still don't mind the swap.  The car's ride is rough, which makes it a poor choice for driving long distances, but if you are only going to be scooting around town, it is perfect. 

  It is small enough to park in all of the compact car spaces.  The back seat <i>CAN</i> be used to carry two more people but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really don't like them.  The only car I have found with a smaller back seat is a <i>Mitsubishi Eclipse</i>.

  Also, if you have back troubles, I wouldn't recommend this car for you.  It sits too low to the ground and is difficult to get in and out of.

  Overall this car is a great car for someone who likes getting decent mileage, wants some thrills driving and doesn't drive long distances. One thing that I have found annoying is the fact that it doesn't come with any cup holders, so all you coffee drinkers out there take that into consideration before buying an older Integra.

  As an update (5/31/00) I have just passed 90,000 miles on this vehicle with no problems at all.  Though as an afterthought I would like to have a manual transmission.  The <i>&quot;Sport&quot;</i> mode on the automatic transmission works fine and that is usually what I drive it in, but the manual would add a few more ponies and a little more fun.<br><br>
