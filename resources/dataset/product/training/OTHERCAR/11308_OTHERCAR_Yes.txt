            After realized how overpriced today's automobiles are, I am more than thrilled that I own a Volvo 240.  I have had a lot of experiences with my volvo(s).  I was initially dismayed at the age of 16 when my parents filled me in on a little secret.
"Aaron, sorry son but we aren't getting you an Acura Integra like you wanted.  You're getting a Volvo 240."
This was a huge bummer.  What was I going to do with a tank?  Now I know.  I get fantastic mileage, have incredible amounts of space in the backseat (if you know what I mean)as well as the trunk.  I have owned two of these, all because of their undoubtable safety.  I was in a terrifying car-wreck with my first Volvo- most cars would have been destroyed encountering a head on collision at 45 mph, however my Volvo with it's crumple-zone kept me safe.  The only problem I faced was an airbag burn on my forearm.  What better reason to purchase a car than it's safety.  After all, that's all that matters.  Because of the cars superb job at keeping me alive my parents invested in a second Volvo- same model and year.  I couldn't be happier than their decision.  When the car is toasty- I just sweat it out and put the windows down.  People are starting to understand the Volvo's coolness.  I guess it is growing on them like it grew on me.  I'm sold on Volvo- I'll own this one for another good 10 years.  It will run FOREVER.  It may be slow- but it's safe, and it lasts.  LOVE VOLVO- LOVE LIFE.
