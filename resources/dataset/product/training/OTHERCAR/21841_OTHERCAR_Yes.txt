            When my car gave up the ghost after providing very faithful service for over 200,000 miles I realized it was time for a new car. After checking several makes and models and reading a number of 2002 car reviews I decided to check out the "all-new" 2002 Nissan Altima SE with the 3.5 liter 240 h.p. engine. I test drove the car twice at two different dealers. I test drove the car with a 5 speed manual tranny which is what I was looking for. The car had a firm ride, handled well and the acceleration was excellent except for the slight and unavoidable front wheel drive torque steer when nailing the accelerator from a standstill (I can tell you I had the salesman almost covering his eyes). The 5 speed was pretty "notchy" and squishy though and was not that impressive. I was leaning towards buying the car but because the car is new most dealers wouldn't come down very far from the MSRP sticker price. The best price I got for an SE with every option except leather interior was $25,250. It was then that I decided to test drive the 2002 Maxima SE. The car has the same engine except it has been "tweaked" to add an additional 15 h.p. and boasts a far superior short throw 6 speed manual . I loved the car when I test drove it. I know it has a beam rear suspension as opposed to the independent Altima but unless your going to set up road cones on a track and snake through them at high speed your not going view this as much of a disadvantage. What really impressed me was the 6 speed manual. It is, I believe, the same tranny Nissan will use in the new 350Z and it complements the 255 h.p. engine beautifully. Best of all the Maxima comes standard with many amenities that you must pay extra for on the Altima (i.e. Anti-lock brakes, high intensity discharge Xenon headlights, rear spoiler and splash guards). What sealed the deal for me was the price. With the $1,000 rebate that Nissan is offering on the Maxima I was able to purchase the SE with every option I had been offered on the Altima with the addition of a leather interior and sunroof for $24,150 plus tax and tags. I think it was a better deal and I recommend the car highly.
