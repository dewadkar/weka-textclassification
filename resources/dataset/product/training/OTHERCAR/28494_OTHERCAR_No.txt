            So your buying a Jeep? Think Again! This is my second Jeep. First one was a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. Loved it so much, bought another. Big Mistake! 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. All the bells and whistles you could want. I splurged. 39,800 was the sticker. 
First year, body rusted near the windshield. Yes,warranty covered it after keeping my Jeep for a week and replacing the windshield, and re-painting the whole top. Year and a half, replaced brakes, and have every 12,000 miles afterward. Replaced tires... every 20,000 miles. Meantime, taking it into the the dealer because of a noise it was making in the rear end. To a response of: Can't find anything. 2,000 miles out of warranty and the rear differential goes...2 thousand dollars later it is fixed. next month... drivers side mirror doesn't work. Heated, polarized. $695.00 later that is fixed. Any parts you need, you have to buy direct from Jeep. Talk about $$$ I shudder every time I take it into be inspected. Latest was a frozen calipur in the front. $700.00 later that is fixed. Now, I feel something going hay wire with the transmission. I will lose money up front on selling it, but selling it this week. I hope a mechanic buys it, because no one else can afford the maintenance costs of having this vehicle. Disappointed in Jeeps warranty, service, customer service. Seems a 35,000 plus vehicle should hold up a wee bit better. Research plenty before you buy this vehicle, and plan to put aside $500 a month spending money on your new Jeep.
