            Hi, myname is Kevin and I made the mistake of buying a used saturn SL1. Please do not believe the commercials you see they are friendly as long as your buying,but when it comes to service they all run!!! The car has no pickup and can't get out of it's own way in the snow. Oh and don't get stuck and try to rock your car to get out they are set up to foul out your plugs.I have had this car for 1yr and I purchased the car with 30,000 miles on it and I now have 50,000 miles on the car. I have been in the shop with the car 8 times. In closing I would not tell anyone to buy a SATURN!!!!!   <br><br>
