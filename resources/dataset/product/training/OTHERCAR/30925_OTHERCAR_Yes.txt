            Ok, after driving a brand new car for 3 years (lease, yuck, but that's another epinion), the time came to decide on a new car.  For us (and our budget) a &quot;new to us&quot; car was the only option.  So we began perusing the &quot;Used Car Ads.&quot;  Having been through the &quot;toddler stage&quot;, where a practical car is not only sensible, it's a necessity, I wanted a flashier car, which would still enable my soccer, t-ball, and show choir car pools.  Low and behold the Chrysler Sebring caught my eyes.  Nobody can argue that this is a car that is pleasing to the eye!  I chose to focus on the Chrysler Sebring Convertible JX.

Price:  This car holds its price.  No doubt about it.  The problem I encountered is it jumps from around $10K (in the 1996 range) to the $17-$19K range for a 1997 (JX and JXI).  While I would have preferred to have a 1997, I couldn't justify a $7K jump for one year.  In any event, the models are exactly the same, only differing with the options: CD vs. AM/FM Cassette, Leather seats, etc.  So, I chose the 1996.  Not only did I get an incredible deal ($9,000) vs. the $10,500 retail value, I LOVE my car.  With its V-6 Engine, power seats, locks, etc., the convertible top gives you the feeling of total FREEDOM.  I was lucky enough to find an owner who kept careful track of all of the maintence, repair, etc. throughout the years of his ownership, so I believe I have a good idea of its durability.

Appearance:  Who can say that this car looks nothing other than KOOL!  Even with the top up, people turn their heads.  This is a hot looking car, no doubt about it!

In closure, I guess the only thing I can say is that with the research I performed, and the fact that the seller still made money after owning the car for four years, this is the car for me AND my family. <br><br>
