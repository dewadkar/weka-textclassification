            I bought a used 1995 Mazda Millenia in the year of 1998 with 21,000 miles on it.  That was the beginning of my ownership of this great vehicle.  My car came with the premium package which includes leather, sun roof, Bose speaker system with CD Player, and chrome wheels.  Sounds pretty nice huh?  Well it is, and I have enjoyed this car ever since I bought it.

What makes this car a joy to drive is the actual way it handles itself on the road.  Made with quality parts, the Mazda Millenia is very smooth on the road and you can hardly feel like your driving sometimes.  Packing a V-6, 2.5L engine, the acceleration is not extremely fast, but it is decent.  Braking and steering is tight which make for great safety features.

Whether you are looking to buy a new or used car, I would definitely recommend you take a look at the Mazda Millenia before you make any final purchases.  This car available in 3 different models, can make anybody enjoy driving just a little bit more.<br><br>
