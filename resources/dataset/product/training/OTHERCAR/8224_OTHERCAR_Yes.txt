            I bought this vehicle mainly for the attractiveness.  I feel it is quite an attractive vehicle.

The gas mileage on it is not something which I feel most people will enjoy for too long.  Mine only gets about 18 to 20 miles per gallon.  In addition to that, I am pretty sure, but not certain (I was told this by the dealership) that you can only put 93 octane gas in it.  Otherwise the engine will not run as well.  So you will more than likely raise your gas bill quite a lot with this vehicle.

The suspension on this vehicle is great, you will hardly feel any sort of impact from the road, unless of course it is of a significant size.  The one thing I notice about it is that (mainly because it's top heavy) is that it will tilt when going around curves.  You go to the right, and the vehicle will shift weight and lean to the left.  Physics cause this of course, but this vehicle doesn't seem like it was built to counter that effect.  So as long as you don't go around sharp curves at high speeds, you should be okay.

As for the steering, I would venture to say that it is very well.  Mine has no play in the steering at all, and it is power steering, but it's tight.  It responds as soon as you move the wheel.

The one thing I didn't like about the vehicle is the ratio of the engine to the size.  There may be some better options available, but with mine I think the size of the engine was not strong enough for the size of the vehicle, it doesn't accelerate very quickly.  Some people, because of this, may have the tendency to give more gas, which in turn will pull off your gas mileage.

I would say that those people who have more than enough money not to worry about gas prices would be fine owning this vehicle.  It certainly has the looks and the luxury, so those folks should be happy.  The factory installed sound system is pretty good too.<br><br>
