            Minivans, I must admit, are not my cup of tea when it comes to vehicles. The very word conjures up images of soccer moms schlepping herds of noisy kids with baggy shorts and skinned knees while they simultaneously zip down the freeways, apply a fresh coat of makeup, carry on an animated cellphone discussion, and administer justice to the denizens of the back seat with a firm but fair hand. Superwomen, they... I, on the other hand, have never attended a soccer game (excluding kitty soccer with a paper wad on the kitchen floor), and my rare forays into the world of makeup entail either the theater or Hallowe'en night. Oh, and my only child is perpetually naked (except for a thick coat of fur) and walks on all fours. In short, I typically have neither the need nor the inclination to drive a minivan, much less carpool a passel of screaming pre-teens. That means I'll probably never find myself uttering that signature phrase of the new century, "Brittany! You cut that out now! No, I mean the <i>other</i> Brittany!"

On occasion however, I do find myself driving a minivan -- usually when my local rental joint doesn't have anything else left (except maybe Chevy Metros). That's exactly what happened last week, when my "connection" (Allison) down at the Enterprise office sent me out in a 2001 Chevy Venture for my Austin-to-Houston trip. Four days and 450 miles later, here's my note on the experience. Hope they're of some help.


<b>Grand Designs?</b>

Face facts: the Venture is a utilitarian vehicle in a utilitarian field. Minivans are designed to maximize interior room (the <i>"van"</i> part) while minimizing exterior size (the <i>"mini"</i> part). That means most of them pretty much look alike: a long, skinny box with a nose where an engine fits. On the inside, there are seats for eight and a variety of spaces for cargo in various sizes and shapes. There's a hatch in the back (they call 'em "liftgates" now because "hatchback" became a dirty word somewhere along the line); and doors on the sides. Nowadays minivans have a sliding door on <i>both</i> sides -- something that's such a no-brainer you wonder why no one thought of it before about five years ago. 

The Venture looks pretty much the same as many of the other minivans: the Windstar, the Caravan, the Voyager... The interior isn't all that different from others in its class, either. Looks, then aren't any particular reason for differentiating between minivans.


<b>The Driving Interface</b>

The driver's seat of the LT model boasts the fabled six-way power adjustment (not so, the passenger seat). I found it pretty easy to move to a comfortable driving position (but, then, I'm a very average-sized driver). Seating is comfortable for medium-duration trips, though lumbar support is a bit weak. 

The instrument panel is -- you guessed it -- utilitarian. The central speedometer is flanked by fuel and temperature guages; all other information comes in the form of idiot lights, except a digital odometer / dual trip odometer / oil life indicator (the reset button's in a very awkward location). This trim line includes a trip computer, which displays in a ceiling console. Readouts include instantaneous and trip fuel economy, average speed, fuel range, exterior temprerature, and fuel used. Resetting the readouts is a bit tricky, especially since the buttons are placed on a flimsy mini-console. Also in the ceiling are a sunglasses case (which doesn't hold anything but very ordinary glasses) and a garage-door opener compartment.

The column mounted shift selector displays the gear at the base of the instrument panel; the indicator is a distracting bright white square light. Since the shifter's on the right, there are a ton of controls on a stalk off the left side of the column: cruise control, dimmer switch, windshield washer/wiper and, of course, turn signals. Access to the wiper controls is rather awkward.

On the dashboard, you'll find the usual climate controls, including a separate fan control for the seating area. The rear wiper/washer controls are located on the lower panel of the dashboard, below climate controls. An AM/FM/CD/Cassette sound system sits at the top of the central console; it features auto tone control (some GM engineer's idea of optimal mixture for pop, jazz, c/w, etc.) and auto volume control. Sound from the stock system is serviceable but unremarkable.


<b>Driving the Venture</b>

The 3.4 L V-6 puts out 185 horsepower, yielding decent acceleration (for a minivan, that it) at both the top and bottom of the speed range. EPA mileage estimates are 16 city and 25 highway; I averaged about 23 MPG for my trip, which was mostly highway driving. The available transmission is a four-speed automatic overdrive, which I found to shift smoothly and reliably. Handling is good for a vehicle of its class, although a43-foot turning circle makes the Venture a bit tough to slip into tight parking spaces. The steering is responsive and predictable; I didn't sense much body roll at higher speeds (freeway interchanges, etc.), nor did the vehicle dip or sway excessively in lower-speed maneuvering.

The suspension is tuned well, though I can't speak for response when the vehicle is loaded. The Venture handles bumps well, though a very rough road can yield some fairly extensive rocking. Handling and ride are slightly better than that of a Caravan I drove some weeks ago. 


<b>Safety</b>

The Venture comes with dual front air bags standard; some trim levels include standard side air bags. Child safety seat anchors are available in the center and rear seats. According to government data, this vehicle and its twin (the Pontiac Montana) are rated "Poor" in front crash tests.


<b>Amenities and comments</b>

- dual power ports in front panel 
- two cupholders in front, two in rear
- folding center seat (60:40 split); the seatbacks have another four cupholders molded in. Folding the seats requires two hands
- removable rear seats in some trim levels
- undersized glove compartment with oversized door
- small CD storage box at center front; CDs are a tight fit
- compact spare tire (underneath the frame at the rear)
- no console, though a small cargo net is supplied to hang between front seats
- daytime running lamps


<b>The <i>Good</i>, the <i>Bad</i>, and the <i>Indifferent</i> </b>

<i>Good Stuff</i>

+ responsive yet economical engine
+ smooth handling (for a vehicle of its class)
+ clear, visible controls (for the most part)
+ driver seating comfort, middle and rear-seat room
+ 

<i>The Indifferent</i>

= passenger and rear seat comfort
= limited storage in passenger area, especially the undersized glove box
= moderate engine and road noise
= utilitarian styling

<i>The Bad</i>

- build quality: lots of squeaks and rattles, especially on bumpy surfaces
- multifunction turn-signal stalk
- control placement for overhead console and trip odometer
- crash test results


<b>Overall</b>

Although the Venture is slightly more economical and a bit roomier than much of its competition, it suffers a bit from quality-control problems. For those among us who are concerned with safety, the crash-test results are a bit off-putting. Based solely on drivability and convenience, I'd rate the Venture average or slightly above -- most of its domestic competition also suffers from quality-control problems as well. 

The Venture drives well and economically, and will get your carpool full of soccer players to the fields in relative comfort and, well, not really in style. As for its safety and reliability; well, you can't say I didn't warn you. Recommended, but not whole-heartedly. Ponder the safety data long and hard if it's important to you.

Hope this helped!
