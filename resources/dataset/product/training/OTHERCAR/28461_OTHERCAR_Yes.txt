            I absolutely love my car.  I bought it because of the massive room and the smooth luxurious ride.  I purchased the XLS because I like the gadgets.  Additionally, I am getting about 28 miles to the gallon on trips which makes the car affordable as well.

Love:
Room
In-dash CD Changer and Stereo
Dual Climate Control
Computer

Hate:
Noise when sunroof is open
Passenger Door Does Not Unlock When Car is Turned off

This is the best car in this price range if you are looking for big, quiet, and luxurious.  I tested the Acura TL, Lexus ES, Volvo, Catera, Lincoln LS.  Hands down in the categories mention, this car ranks #1.  If you are looking for a more sporty feel, you should look to the TL.  If you are looking at the Lexus ES, this is a better car because it is built on the GS frame.  The car is very roomy and easy to carry passengers around in.  I have 20,000 miles on my car and have had no problems at all.<br><br>
