            For my '99 Christmas present, my mother gave me her 1989 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (Automatic). (It's gray for those of you who care.) It was my best present ever! Yeah, it's pretty old, but Still a wonderful car.

Electrical windows, locks, and Seat. Great interior design. Extreme Comfort! Wonderful Car! Another thing I like, is that the radio controls are ALSO on the steering wheel. No more reaching over to the buttons, just move your thumb around and surf through the radio!

I don't know much about cars, but I know this is a keeper. When this one gets too old (if ever), I know I will get another one! These are great cars, and built by the right company!
This car runs smoothly, looks GREAT, and has a HUGE trunk (One of my friends says it is comfortable anyway).
There is One problem with this car. It isn't the car though. Before this was my car, it went through hell and back. My older sister tore out the transmission completely, and I don't have the money for a new one yet.

This car has been on MANY MANY MANY road trips, and is Still running Great.

This car is just perfect for me! It is small, comfortable, and very pretty. (It is gray with a gray interior for those who care)

I only have ONE problem ... One day my antenna got broken, and I can't seem to replace it. I have tried to take it off so I could buy a new one, but It is complicating. There are a lot of wires going to it, and I can't seem to figure it out. I went to buy a new one, and got someone to look at it, and they couldn't figure it out either.
So I need your help here. If you know anything about what I am talking about here, and have had to replace yours before, please leave your comments. E-mail me or just leave one on Epinions. I will get it either way. ( I know absolutely NOTHING about cars, and know it can't be too hard, but I can't figure it out)...

Hopefully, I will be getting a picture on here for those of you who care.
