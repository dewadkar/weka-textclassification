            I have owned a 1990 Honda Prelude SI since April of 1999.  My previous cars were a 1991 Mercury Tracer and a 1997 Dodge Neon--the Honda far surpasses both of them in every respect.  

The engine is smooth and powerful, holding the cars cruising speed even on steep grades.  One oddity here is that at sixty miles per hour, in fifth gear, the car sounds like it is struggling---push it to eighty and she purrs like a kitten.  I suppose it just doesnt like being driven slowly. The handling is perfect, with relatively no body lean in cornering--the gas pedal BEGS to be floored when curves are ahead.

The dash layout is sensible.  While the radio controls are smallish, they are easy to get used to...and the climate control panel is simple and straight-forward.  The front seats fit me like a glove.  The driver gets lateral and lumbar support controls--perfect for long trips.  The backseat however, is useful only as a parcel shelf. Trunk space is admirable for a car in this class.

My Prelude has 58,000 miles on it--15,000 of which I have put on.  After ten years, the paint still shines like new, all the features work flawlessly, and the design is as pleasing as it was in 1990.  You cant go wrong with a Honda, and if you are looking for performance tempered with reliability--the Prelude is the car for you!
