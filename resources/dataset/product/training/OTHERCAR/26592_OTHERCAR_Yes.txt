            Chevrolet has had a few recalls on this truck for other things, but when our wipers quit working earlier this year, we could not find any information on a recall for them. 

The problem is that they will just suddenly quit while you are going down the road or even over a bump. There were many times my husband had to get out and open the hood and hit the housing where the wiper motor was just to get them running again. And even though he did that, they would work for only a few min. and then suddenly stop again. 

He finally took the truck into the dealer last week and they said they checked to see if there was a recall on these wiper motors, but the service manager said he couldn't find anything. 

I called there the next day and asked them specifically, WHO makes the wiper motor (I still suspect it is a manufacturer's defect, not necessarily Chevrolet's per se) and the service manager told me he did not know. He suggested I call the Chevrolet Customer Assistance Center (800-222-1020) and tell them what the problem was. 

In the mean time, I had also found the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, and in doing a search there, had found 10 complaints from other C2500 Chevrolet Pickup Truck owners. Each listed the same problem and frustrations with this wiper motor. 

I did call the Chevrolet 800 number and told them of my safety concerns about this wiper problem. We had just paid $92.53 to get it repaired, and even though the money was a factor, it was not as important as them letting us know that there is a KNOWN problem with these wipers. 

For anyone who has this truck make, model and year, you need to have your VIN number handy and call that 800 number. Our VIN number did fall within the policy (that is the way the representative put it) and she called our local dealer where the repair had been done. 

The service manager told her he would have to talk to his &quot;area rep.&quot; to see about a refund, and you can be sure if I do not hear from him in a timely manner, he will be hearing from me again. 

The woman I talked to at the Chevy Customer Assistance Center also told me to call them back if I did not get a refund from the local dealer. 

I want people to know this is covered by a recall (#98043 Windshield Wiper Failure) and that they need to be aware their wipers could suddenly quit working. 

UPDATE (Sept.15,2000): I received a call today from the service manager at our local dealership, Grey Chevrolet, here in Port Orchard. He had talked to his area rep. and has the go ahead to give us a refund for the $92.53 they charged us. The check should be arriving in 3 weeks he said.

************UPDATE**************************
I did a follow-up call to Grey Chevrolet on October 6, and talked to the service manager, who told me that the bookkeeper would be the one to contact. He transferred me to her, and she said that she was expecting money on the following Tuesday. I got a call from her on Wednesday the 11th saying she would be cutting the check for the full amount, and that she would call me on Friday when the check was ready. She did so and we picked the check up that same day. Our experience with the local dealer was a very good one. I didn't get the feeling they were reluctantly giving us our money back. I would like to know if they are alerting any of their other customers who bought this same truck that there is a very dangerous problem with the windshield wipers.  <br><br>
