            Got my 97 Grand Am GT brand new and so far no major problems after 34,500 miles.  Recently the &quot;check engine&quot; warning light came on and I took the car to the dealer for a diagnostic check.  Upon the check, no problem was detected.  The car was running fine.  All they did was to clear the warning code, not repair work done.  Their speculation was a computer glitch.  To my dismay, I was charged $93 for the check with no actual repair work nor any part replaced.  I told the dealer that I strongly felt that it should be covered by warranty.  Guess what, GM really did their probability homework.  My warranty expired 2 months ago, just barely, but mileage was still less than the 36,000 miles normal warranty mileage.  I had no choice but paid the stiff charges for one simple test.  Called the Pontiac Customer Assistance Center to voice my concern, but naturally, I lost.  I guess I need to start a trust fund account to pay for the next erroneous &quot;check engine&quot; warning indication, another $93.  Oh, by the way, read your warranty carefully next time when you purchase a car.  The Federal Emission Warranty has been reduced to 24,000 miles, not the 5 years/50000 miles prior to 1994.  <br><br>
