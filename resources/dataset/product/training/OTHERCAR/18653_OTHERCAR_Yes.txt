            This car is an all around good buy. If you are into cars, you can really get a lot of extra parts added on to it. It is great for racing and showing off, but if you just need it to drive around - I guess that is ok too. It really is a high quality vehicle. I have had no problems with it and it is still holding up very nicely. It is a great ride and really fun to drive. The best person to buy this would most likely be a guy who is into import cars. It will work for the ladies too though. Acuras are high quality vehicles and I have been impressed with everything about them. My favorite thing about this car is racing. I love to go drag at import car shows and show off my baby. It is already fast and has great handling but can be improved even more.<br><br>
