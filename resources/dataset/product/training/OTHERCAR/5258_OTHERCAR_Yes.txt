            Talk about a jack of all trades!  The styling is flat gorgeous, but in hatchback form it will swallow whatever you need to carry.  It has perfectly weighted steering, a wonderful gearbox and pedals that feel like finely honed muscles, but still provides a comfortable, confident ride by sport coupe standards.  Only two things keep this great car from being perfect: a *ahem* dissonant engine and pathetic tires.

Toyotas are widely renowned for their refinement, and this little gem is no exception.  Compared to, say, an Eclipse, everything feels tightly bolted together.  There is no slack in any of the controls, just instant responsiveness.  At about 2500 pounds, this little car kicks butt in the twisties, but not at the expense of livability.  The interior is highly functional, from its great driving position (even for a 6 footer) to the logical placement of the climate controls.  If not as brilliantly uncluttered as a Subaru SVX, its dash is as at least as easy to navigate.

How about performance?  My ST 5-speed did the 0-60 trick in 8.9 seconds using a method that would probably get me arrested instantly, and GTs are rated at around 8 seconds.  An automatic will raise both numbers by around a half second.  Power is adequate for most purposes, but you're not going to get anywhere on the dragstrip.  The quality of the engine noise isn't too spectacular, either.  It's like a Tercel's, but with a couple of only nominally rousing whines added to the mix.  Removing the air filter yields a baritone-sax growl that forms into a thrilling, brassy scream above 5000 RPM, but I wouldn't recommend doing that for anything but drag racing.  The payoff for this racket is a consistent 30-35 MPG, under any conditions.

Now, the styling.  It seems like everybody loves it.  Its four very large headlights are reptilian looking, and its grilless poker face will leave the guy in front of you guessing.  The scallops that lead back from the lights give the driver a Jaguar-like view over the hood, a visual treat.  The long flanks give this tiny hatchback an imposing presence on the road.  The expressive, sad-eyed taillights finish the statement admirably -- just don't get one without a wing.  The saucy little flip at the edge of the tail just begs for something to hang on for dear life.

In all, I'm looking forward to spending a long time with this overlooked little gem.  Every time an Integra driver snaps his head around to check out the little thing setting back on her haunches and pouring her heart out, I will smile, knowing I don't have what everybody else in the schoolyard plays with.<br><br>
