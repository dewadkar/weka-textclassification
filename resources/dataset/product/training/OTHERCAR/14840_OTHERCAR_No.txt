            After taking the Olds for its first spin I noticed a lack of power.  It always seemed to be thinking about providing the horsepower that is under the hood but never came through.  The engine, from a standing start, always seemed to be in 4L.  Just thinking it was me I floored it, wrong thing to do.  I heard this large &quot;POP&quot; and the engine/transmission wasn't right after that.

I stopped immediately and smelled burnt transmission fluid.

The interior is well apportioned and has the usual GM quality intrumentation.

Seating was adquate for a 6'3&quot; person although a extension on the seat to aid in thigh support would be appreciated.

There was good visability around the Bravada, no real blind spots to speak of.

All in all a good effort from Oldsmobile.  I can't wait to see the re-designed unit.<br><br>
