            When it became abundantly clear that my wife's 1993 Grand Prix was turning into an unreliable money pit, we decided it was time for something new. I've always loved Pontiacs, and had almost $1,000 in rebates on my GM credit card, so the Vibe was the first car we looked at. Being on a somewhat tight budget, we couldn't afford the more muscular Ponchos like the Grand Prix GTP, but we ended up really liking the Vibe. In a matter of two weeks, a new Shadow metallic Vibe was parked in our garage.

The Vibe is an all-new type of vehicle -- not just for Pontiac, but also for the entire automotive world. Like its sister car, the Toyota Matrix, the Vibe is one of the first "crossover" entries that blends equal parts "car", "station wagon" and "SUV".  The result is a vehicle that's sporty, roomy, easy to drive, and moderately sized all at the same time. It's also a new strategy for Pontiac in general -- the Vibe was co-engineered by Pontiac and Toyota, resulting in a car with Pontiac's sporty flair and Toyota's masterful engineering and reliability in one sleek package.

Below, I'll touch on the car's various aspects.

<b>Powertrain</b>

Of the three models of Vibes available -- Base, GT, and All Wheel Drive -- we chose the Base, primarily because an automatic transmission is not available on the more performance-oriented GT, and we have no need (nor money to burn) for the AWD. The Base Vibe comes with the same Toyota-built 1.8L 4-cylinder VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing) engine used in the Corolla. It's rated at 130 horsepower and around 125 lb-ft of torque. It's definitely not a powerhouse, especially for someone who's used to the kick of a V8 like the one in my '98 Trans Am. But it was perfect for my wife -- the engine is extremely smooth and not overly loud, while still providing a decent punch when you lay down the throttle. Unless you're hauling two people and a sofa, you'll not have any trouble passing cars on the freeway, unlike some 4-cylinder economy cars out there. And, as to be expected, it's frugal with its consumption of gasoline. You'll make close to 28 MPG city and anywhere from 33 to 38 highway. Takes regular unleaded.

The Base Vibe comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission. We ordered the optional ($800) 4-speed automatic. It has an electronic overdrive toggle instead of two gears for D and OD. The unit's shifts are very smooth, especially under normal acceleration. If you hop on the accelerator to pass someone at speed, the tranny waits for a moment and then makes a pretty hard downshift that might startle you at first.

For those interested in the GT, you'll get a large performance increase over the Base. The GT ships with the same 180-hp VVTL-i 4-cylinder used in the Toyota Celica! But you'll have to know how to drive a stick -- it only comes with a 6-speed manual transmission.

By the way, for those who wish to enhance the performance of their Vibe with a turbo or supercharger, here's some advice: Get a Base Vibe, not a GT. The reason? The base engine has a lower compression ratio (10:1 as opposed to the GT's 11.5:1), giving you room for more boost.

<b>Handling</b>

The Vibe's cornering ability is wonderful. My old Grand Prix was a tank -- it took some real muscle to steer it, and its turning radius was abysmal. The Vibe has an extraordinarily sharp turning radius, and in the process of achieving it, you can spin the wheel almost effortlessly with one hand. It's not quite as light as the Variable-Effort Steering on the Grand Am GT1, but it's a close second. My wife was especially pleased with the Vibe's easy maneuverability.

<b>Looks</b>

The Vibe is definitely a looker. I find it much more attractive and sporty than the Toyota Matrix. It combines Pontiac's typical aggressive exterior styling with some very classy interior details. As standard equipment, the Vibe's exterior is a two-tone applique that is painted metal for the top 2/3rds of the car, and gray plastic cladding on the bottom 1/3rd (and around the wheelwells). Think Chevy Avalanche. Some people really hate the cladding. Others, like me, don't mind it when matched with certain colors. Our Vibe's color is Shadow, a sort of warm gunmetal metallic -- a perfect match with the gray cladding. But if you just can't stand it, Pontiac offers a monotone paint option that replaces the gray plastic with painted surfaces. It'll cost you $500. Rumor has it that the Vibe GT will be coming standard with monotone paint, perhaps next model year.

Inside, the interior is very classy. The instruments and door panels are decked out in faux chrome and titanium metallic trim, and the circular gauges are rimmed with chrome plating. This is definitely a departure from the Pontiac interiors I'm used to -- mostly cheap gray plastic, cheesy headliner, blah blah. The Vibe is much, much nicer. The interior controls are all standard Toyota equipment, including the horrendous tilt wheel -- the steering wheel can pivot only about a total of two inches. Those used to American cars (like me) will find that the power door lock switch operates in the opposite order -- press the top to lock, and the bottom to unlock.

<b>Comfort & Entertainment</b>

The Vibe is very comfortable inside. There's tons of leftover headroom, even for me at 6'2". It feels like there is much more lateral (elbow) room than the PT Cruiser, and the cloth-upholstered seats feel great. There's plenty of adjustability in the driver's seat for my wife, who is petite. My only complaint is that as you adjust the seat up and down, it also moves forward and back a little bit, and can put you perilously close to the steering wheel. Rear visibility is a little tough to get used to, as you really have to crane your neck around to see out the rear window when backing. Overall, I'm very pleased with the interior comfort level.

The ride height is slightly high, but not like an SUV -- it's easy to get in and out, but the Vibe is a relatively tall vehicle and this contributes to its smoothness. The car has a very solid feel -- no squeaks or rattles, and it takes bumps very smoothly. Unlike my Grand Prix, which sounded like the dashboard was going to fall off every time you struck a pothole.

The Vibe does not come with power locks, windows, etc. unless you purchase the $1,000 Power Package, as we did. It does, however, include dual power mirrors as standard equipment. The instrumentation on the car consists of a speedometer, tachometer, engine temperature and fuel gauge. There is no voltmeter or oil press, which I feel to be an oversight when absent from any car. Also, the red backlit gauges -- while extremely cool looking -- must be lit up at all times to be seen. They don't just light up when your lights are on at night; they are always on. The gauges are set behind smoked plexiglas and when not lit, all you see are blank, black gauge faces. It's stylistically cool, but the gauges often are A) hard to read during sunny days, especially with sunglasses on, and B) too bright at night without adjusting the dimmer.

Our Vibe is equipped with what Pontiac calls the "Moon & Tunes Package." At a cost of $800, the package includes a power moon roof w/integrated shade and a 200-watt, 6-speaker stereo system with in-dash CD player. The moon roof is a great feature on hot days, and the sound from the stereo is quite good, especially at higher volumes. You'll probably want to set the front/rear fade bias a little to the rear, otherwise you won't hear the rear speakers. The radio is also equipped with the new Radio Data System, which can display additional information transmitted by the station, such as the call letters, program style and artist/song information. A 6-disc in-dash CD changer is available as a $300 option, as is a $1,600 DVD-based navigation system. Lastly, the air conditioning deserves some mention: It's <i>cold</i>, which is just what we need here in Florida.

Other cool features include automatic headlights (they turn on when a sensor detects the ambient light level has dropped, such as when night falls), a rear window wiper/washer, two trip odometers, and an outside temperature gauge which is located on the odo/trip display.

<b>Safety & Security</b>

The Vibe is stickered as inexpensive car, but once you add all the available options, you're looking at a somewhat pricey machine. Most of the Vibe's safety/security features are optional equipment. As standard features, the Base Vibe includes seat belts (obviously), driver & passenger air bags, and front disc/rear drum brakes. Side-impact air bags ($300) and Anti-Lock Brakes ($500) are optional. (In Canada, they are both offered together as part of a "Safety Package".) Also optional is the elaborate anti-theft system ($300). You may find that when looking for a Vibe, all of the above features are rather uncommon amongst dealer stock. Our Vibe has none of the above, as we simply couldn't find any pre-assembled cars with these features.

<b>Availability</b>

This is the debut year for the Vibe, and demand is high. It seems as though Pontiac underestimated the demand for the car, as there is currently a 12-18 week waiting period for factory-ordered Vibes. If you want a Vibe <i>now</i>, your best bet is to use GMBuyPower.com to find the car you want in a dealer's inventory. That's how I located my Vibe -- and got a great deal to boot. Some dealers may tell you that no one is offering deals on the Vibe, and that you should expect to pay retail. This is not true. I got my Vibe for factory invoice! Just do some shopping around. Look for high-volume dealers with low overhead; they can offer the best prices.

<b>Accessories</b>

GM offers a huge array of accessories for the Vibe, including rear cargo nets, a folding gearbox, first aid kits, ski racks and a front end cover (car bra). The complete catalog is available from the GM Accessories Zone on the Internet (http://www.gmgoodwrench.com/accessories/). Accessories are available for purchase from any Pontiac dealer's parts department, but you'll want to shop around there too -- one local dealer tried to charge me double the list price for these items!

<b>Overall</b>

The new Pontiac Vibe is an impressive package, combining the best of both the American and Japanese automotive worlds. Toyota's influence here is keenly felt, in the solid powertrain, the efficient interior controls, and the 7,500 mile/12 month suggested interval between oil changes (!!!) Pontiac is also here in full force, delivering that edgy style I've long known and loved. It's one of the best new cars to come out of Pontiac showrooms in a long time, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, fun -- and inexpensive -- set of wheels.
