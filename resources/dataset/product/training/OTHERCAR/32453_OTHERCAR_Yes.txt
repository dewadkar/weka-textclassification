            Nissan was the first to bring reliable, affordable sportscars to the U.S. But, about two years ago, Nissan pulled the curtain on the 240SX and the 300ZX. Now they have no two door (with the exception of their pick-up) in their lineup. 

I have always been fond of <b><i>Nissan sports cars</i></b>. In fact, I would say that they were the leader in this category. My personal experience with Nissan is extensive. I've owned a <i>'73 Datsun 240Z</i>, a <i>'77 Datsun 280Z</i> and a <i>'78 Datsun 280Z</i>. I also owned an <i>'81 Datsun 310DX</i> - believe it or not, that was a great sporty econo-car!

My mother purchased one of the first new '90 300ZX's in '89. This June she will be trading it in for a <i>BMW 323 convertable</i>. My Parents usually replace their cars every 4 years; so it's telling that she kept this one for 11 years. <i>Anyway, I thought I'd write a little memoir on this car.</i>

The '89 300 was ground-breaking. The car sports a slick look that is reminiscent of the <i>Porsche 928's</i> and <i>944's</i> of the era. It came in the popular silver color; Mom's car is a head-turner. Especially when compared to dated looking competitors like the <i>Supra</i> and the <i>Prelude</i>.

This car is an everyday driver. With the 2+2 configuration, it can haul around two children, when necessary. The hatch opens to expose a large space for groceries and other daily necessities. It gets about 20mpg.  The front leather seats are very welcoming. As is the interior layout that still seems up to date. All of the controls are intuitively placed where you'd expect them. The <b>T-tops</b> require a little work to take out, but boy is it worth it. There's nothing like the experience of the peripheral stimulation of seeing blue sky and feeling the wind rush by.

This car handles like it's on rails. There is minimal body lean, as you would expect from a high-performance sports car. This car is not good in slippery conditions. <i>So leave it home when it's icy out!</i>

The manual transmission shifts smoothly, like most Japanese tranny's. It is geared just right for this engine. And, ooh, that 6 cylinder is smooth. I wouldn't mind being able to hear it rev a little more! And, it takes this car to 60 in about 7 seconds.

Want to hear about the reliability? This car was loaded with features, which means that a lot can go wrong. <b>With 90K on this 11 year old car, the only problem was a bad air conditioner at 60K.</b> My Mom did run over a curb once, and had to replace the front spoiler. But, her insurance covered it.

I'm very tempted to ask her to sell it to me, but I might have to fight with my Dad first. He's trying to figure out how he can keep it around for his own weekend fun. Besides, having just bought a new car, and owning a 1 year old BMW motorcycle, I'm not sure I'm willing to pay insurance on another vehicle.

<i><b>Note to Nissan... get moving on your sports car program SOON!!!!</b></i>
