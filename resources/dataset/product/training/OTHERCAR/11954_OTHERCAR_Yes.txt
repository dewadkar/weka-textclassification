                So far I have 2500 miles on the truck and it has been a great experience. I purchased a 2002 xtra cab 4x4 with the sr5 package which includes the cd player, white faced gauges, v6 power, cruise control, bigger tires, and delay wipers. I looked at many trucks but found the build quality of the Toyota to be quite good compared to may of the other brands I looked such as the Dodge and Nissan.  Going over rough roads the front independent suspension takes alot of the shock where as in the back it is a bit bouncy but not that bad.  The truck heats up very quickly for those colorado winters and that is just a bonus.  The Xtra cab is only big enough for smaller kids up to about 8 years old.  I wouldnt even think of having an adult trying to squeeze back there.  
   The v6 seems to have plenty of power even with the 5spd and the bigger tires.  I can get up to speed and pass on the highway with ease.  I didnt go with the TRD package because I didnt feel that the truck was that different from the package I got except for the $3000 dollar difference.  I didnt need power windows, locks, and the locking rear.  I have got about 18 miles in the city so far per gallon and I think that will go up when the engine gets more broken in.  The cd player with the 6 speaker sound system actually sounds pretty good and the brakes stop on a dime.   
    The only two bad things I can think of about the truck is the clunky 5 spd.  It isnt very smooth going from gear to gear but that also may change with the break in period.  Another would be the location of the clock.  You basically have to take your eyes off the road to see what time it is because they put the clock almost right behind the steering wheel so it is very had to see.
  Those are the things I basically like about the truck.  It has good looks, power, and reliablity that I need.  If you are looking for a smaller pickup this is the one for you.  I found that nobody could beat the price of my truck through Autonation in town. I have not been able to test the 4 wheel drive as of yet and will do another review as the miles pile on.

My Tacoma Xtra-cab SR5 now has 8000 miles on it and running strong.  We have had a blizzard in Colorado with about 40 inches of snow and the truck tracked great.  This was the test of the year to see how well the four wheel drive operates.  I was pleasantly suprised how nimble the truck manuvered in deep powder.  I would say there was at least 30 inches of snow on the ground and I put the truck in four wheel drive low and it seemed unstoppable. 

The only thing that I have noticed is the seat squeaks a bit here and there.  Other than that the gas mileage has stayed the same at 18-20 miles per gallon.  I wish I would have spent the extra money and bought the four door model.

So far now on the Toyota Tacoma I have over 15,000 miles on the truck.  The gas milage has consistantly stayed the same and the motor is running smooth.  About the only performance thing I have put on the truck is a reusable K and N Filter.  The squeaks have disappeared mysterously disappeared from the seat from my last review.  Now I have a slight squeal on my front brakes if I lightly come to a halt.  Its not overbearing but just enough to let you know it is there.  Its not that much of a problem yet to take it into the dealership as of yet.  

I have had this truck for more than a year now and its probably one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I am also using a new wax on my car called 5 star shine.  It claims on not having to wax your car for 3 years and I was alittle skeptical at first but tried it.  I have had it on my truck since June of this year through rain and snow and its still on the truck.  It is a bit expensive but those of you who like to keep your car or truck looking great with out spending hours on waxing this is the one for you.  My review is on that website as well.
