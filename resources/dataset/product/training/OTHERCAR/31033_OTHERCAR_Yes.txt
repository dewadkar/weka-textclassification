            This is my first car. I have only had it about a month, but it seems to be pretty great, and well worth the price. Everyone is amazed when they see this car, especially when i tell them it was only 5 grand. Style-wise, this car is great. it looks like it should cost twice as much. The interior is cloth, with really nice seats that fit my body perfectly. what surprises me is the amount of room in the backseats. My friend is 6'3'', and he doesn't even complain when he has to ride in the backseat. The trunk space is also excellent. I usually keep my golf clubs and tennis gear back there, and i have yet to run out of room for anything. This car is the SE model, with a 1.6 liter engine. It is fine for normal driving, but i really do want something that can really get up and fly. Like another  reviewer, josh9966 said, the low-end power is virtually non-existant, but when you get up in the mid-range rpms, the car can really fly. I wish i had gotten the SE-R, with it's 2.0 liter engine. Now those cars, they are true sports cars. I would recommend them both, but if you have a need for speed, the 2.0 liter is a must.   <br><br>
