            In 1994 I purchased a new Jeep Cherokee, a month ago I traded it in for a 2000.  I cannot tell you how pleased I am with this vehicle.  Although the engine is not the same as that of the 94 Cherokee with respect to power, it is still a very capable engine.  The engine was redesigned, and the Jeep no longer has the &quot;put you back in your seat&quot; initial punch, but still has extreme power, with smoother acceleration.  It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to an engine since I have owned the 94 Cherokee, I test drove many SUV's when looking for a new vehicle, and what I found was a lack of power and acceleration.  It seems they are making the trucks bigger, and the engines are still staying the same.  (Remember the 4 cylinder engine in the Isuzu Trooper?.)  This truck has the right engine for the weight of the vehicle, a perfect match.
The interior is completely redesigned, and beautiful I must add.  The four door has ample room for my 5 year old son in the back seat, a feature that is a great asset to those with a family.  The stereo has a great sounding CD and tape player, instead of one or the other.  This vehicle is a great find, and if it proves to be as dependable as my 94 Cherokee, you cannot go wrong.    <br><br>
