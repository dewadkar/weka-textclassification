            I purchased a 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee used, about a year ago. The original owner had put about 19,000 miles on it, and she was having trouble making the payments. I picked it up for $21,000, which I think is a pretty good deal, since she had paid $30,000 only a year and a half before.

I almost exclusively stick to Japanese brand autos- I've had a Subaru, a Maxima, and still use a '92 Corolla (with 162,000 miles on it!) every day for commuting to work. I've heard horror stories about American, German, and British cars, so I usually play it safe. I needed a 4WD vehicle for my wife, and I asked friends and co-workers about their experiences. To my surprise, the two favorites were the Ford Explorer and the Jeep Grand Cherokee. 

I was able to get a ride in both of these trucks, and the first thing that struck me was the difference in the ride quality between the two. The Explorer was a stiff, bumpy ride that seemed to pitch front to back. I was in the back seat when we went over railroad tracks and that's when I decided to forgo the Explorer. 

However, I was very impressed with the Grand Cherokee suspension, and although I wouldn't say the ride was "car-like", I wouldn't categorize it as "truck-like" either. The owners of the Grand Cherokees were pleased to report very good reliability also. This too, was unexpected. I even spoke to the owner of a Toyota Forerunner who claimed he would never buy another. Very surprising. 

My own personal experience with the 98 Grand Cherokee has been mostly positive. It really does drive great in the snow, even more so now that I replaced the stock Good Year tires with the new Cooper Discoverer A/Ts. (Excellent tires). It has decent cargo space, especially with the rear seats down. The cabin is fairly quiet, and there's sufficient power provided by the V6 engine.

It hasn't been a perfect vehicle though. We have put almost 30,000 miles in the 18 months we've owned it. Just a short time after we purchased it, the gas gauge broke. It would show more than a quarter tank of gas was left, even though it was actually empty! My wife ran out of gas, although not too far from home. We took it back to the Jeep dealer and it was repaired without charge under the warranty. (I have heard the faulty gas gauge has shown up in many Grand Cherokees, so be careful!)

A few weeks after this, I noticed a few small drops of antifreeze on my garage floor. I took it into Jeep again, and they found a very small leak in the water pump. Once again, the repair was done without charge, and we got a brand new water pump. 

Both those repairs were done in the low 20,000 mile range, and we now have almost 50,000 miles on the truck. I am always careful to follow the maintenance schedule for tune-ups and I change the oil every 3,000 miles. 

One last thing I can add in the negative category is that the gas mileage appears to be degrading over time. When we first got the truck, the trip computer would display average fuel economy in the 19 - 20 mpg range. Lately it has slipped to 17 mpg. Compounding this problem is the fact that gas prices have increased over this time period too.

All in all, I am fairly happy with the 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee, but I must admit, I don't feel like I'll be getting 162,000 trouble free miles out of it, the way I have with my Corolla.
