            Ohhh what fun and comfort! They just don't make cars like this any more! Stable, well built, safe, fantastic engine, and most of all fun, Fun, FUN !!

My wife and I always enjoyed sporty cars but until recently had to settle for minivans and such type of family cars.  Before we came across this wonder car we drove many a sports car with many a disappointment.

In our selection process we focused on speed, comfort, handling, and value.  All four where impossible to find until we drove the 300ZX and where very lucky to get it in the 2+2 (rear sets).

Even with 60,000 plus miles it runs like new.  Other than your basic maintenance it has been great.
