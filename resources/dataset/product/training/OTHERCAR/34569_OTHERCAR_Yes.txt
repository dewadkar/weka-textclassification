I had a Honda Passport (1998)which I drove for about five months. In those months, I got four letters from Honda about various defects in the car and had to visit the dealership each time. So I sold the Passport and was deciding between a LandRover and an Infiniti QX4 and finally bought the QX4.
Starting with the experience at the Infiniti dealership, I was in for a pleasent surprise. They have some of the most courteous and knowledgable salespeople around.
In the past ten months that I have been driving the car, it has driven very smoothly although sometimes I feel I could use some more acceleration. The car has a feel of utmost luxury with premium leather seating, sunroof, Bose music system (Try listening to Eine Kline Nachtmusic on some other music system and you will appreciate the difference!)
Getting in and out is comfortable and backseets are spacious as opposed to Land Rover in which the backseet passengers are cramped.
To summarize, I would recommend the QX4 over other cars in the same price range<p>
