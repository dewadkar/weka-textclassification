            This car is so much fun to drive. I got this car broken down for an exchange of my small geo metro (the guy was desperate for a running car). All it needed was a starter. It has been a great car. The seats are very comfortable, it has 4 doors instead of 2 (this makes it easier to get kids in and out of the carseat).I am used to small cars and I feel this car has plenty of room. I can put 3 hampers in it to go to the laundry mat w/o using the trunk. The trunk is fairly large. I have put hampers in it too and it closes with no problem. Gas mileage is pretty good. I drive mostly in town and it I usually go 2 weeks before filling up my gas tank again. I usually do not like to drive standard cars, but I really enjoy this one. The ride is very smooth. The a/c is extremely cold and the heater is excellent. The paint job on my car is holding and the car looks sporty. This is definitely the nicest car I have owned.
