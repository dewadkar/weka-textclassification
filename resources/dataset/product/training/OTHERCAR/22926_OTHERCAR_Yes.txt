            I have had the 95 Rio Grande with manual transmission, and the 4 cylinder engine for about 3 years now.  I drive in every type of the nastiest weather, and my Jeep has never let me down.  I never get stuck, I never have to use snow chains, I have never been stranded, and thankfully I haven't had any breakdowns.  This car is friggin tough too, whenever I go camping, skiing, mt. biking, etc. I throughly abuse this thing and it still looks sharp.  So much fun to drive, these little monster trucks can go anywhere.  
Parts for these things are cheap, and there are many ways to customize your jeep to fit your needs.  Driving around with the top off in summer rules!

Here's the bad stuff:  This thing obviously doesn't get great gas mileage which is the price you pay for having a vehicle that can take you anywhere.  There isn't much room for storing things, and I had to replace my catalytic converter (which isn't uncommon in some jeeps).  Also, if you drive like an idiot, this thing will roll.  But thats not really an issue if you're a safe driver.

So from my experience here are my recommendations:
-get a stick, especially if you get a 4 cyl.  It preserves alot of the power of the engine, the 3 speed automatic is a joke.
-If you have the room to store it, I recommend a hard top because it's quieter, warmer, and lasts longer than the rag tops.  (but its also more of a pain in the butt to change)
-Don't get a/c, just another thing to break, and you don't need it with the top off.
-If you're a big mt. biker or skier get a rack that hooks into the hitch.  They're the cheapest, and save valuable space.
-Don't get big tires, get HUGE tires.

So to sum it up, if you enjoy sleeping under the stars, and crappin' in the woods I highly recommend wranglers.  If you work in a cublicle, have a huge family, and never use 4wd, then look elsewhere.
