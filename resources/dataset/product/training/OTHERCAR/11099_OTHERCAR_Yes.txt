            First things first.  The Samurai has a stiff ride when stock.  It offers very little suspension movement.  Approx 6" of articulation.  All this can change if you want to build an off road toy.

For starters, the Samurai in general is a fun Jeep type thing to drive!  It is a little noisy and can be stiff.  Over all, I have had very few problems with mine but I know people who have.  The one thing about the Samurai is that the crankshafts are hollow at the rod journals.  This makes for a crankshaft to break.  Do not bother rebuilding the eng. with that crank.  How ever, you can go to any junk yard and get a 1.3 Suzuki Swift bottom end.  It's the same block but has a solid cast iron crankshaft and some added support brackets for the block.  Your Samurai will sound solid instead of the hollow sound the eng. makes.

I've lifted my Samurai and used a 4" spring over kit.  It uses the factory springs, just reverses the axle location.  Hints the name, spring over.  (the springs are now over the axle instead of under)  This gives you 4" of lift and a much nicer ride.  You will no longer bounce all over the road.  You also get more axle articulation.  I now have 19" instead of the factory 6"  The Samurai has 31X12.5 Pro Comp Xterrains and with the lift and the tires it has very little body roll.  It corners nicer and handles much better.

You can add all types of things to it such as lockers, p/s, 6 point cage and geared down transfer cases.  It is a true rock crawler.  I have about 10K in mine.  If I built a Jeep with the same things I'd have over 30K.  You do the math!

If your looking for a toy, the Samurai is the way to go.  Look on the net to see the things they have.
