            I would have never known the pleasure of this fine car if I had not looked up that last time. I was looking at a Pontiac Firebird convertible when I found this vehicle. I had walked past it several times not even giving it a second glance. I was ready to buy the Firebird when I took notice of the SVX. I asked to drive it. The first thing I liked was I got the salesman, my 6 yr old daughter, my wife and myself in and nobody got hurt or passed out!! I drove it about 2 miles and bought it that night. That was about a year ago and I have not been sorry for a minute that I purchased a 5 year used SVX. This is the well equipped vehicle I have owned with leather everything from the dash to the backs of the seats. When most vehicles are approaching their end of life at 5 years this beauty is just starting to live. It is a joy to drive in any weather. It handles good at any speed. It also has quite descent performance. It's not a racecar but it does perform very well for a 3400 pound 6 cylinder automatic. So far, after 18,000 miles or so(now at 47,000), I have not had any major troubles just tires, brakes and a battery. I have seen where parts are hard to find even from Subaru so I hope this vehicle holds together well. I have also seen reports about transmission problems in the 92-93 models and hope that my 94 holds up. I would recommend this vehicle to any auto enthusiast. It's a joy to drive but as old age sets in may become more of a maintainence hog. Since the last year model was 97, the newest one is now almost 4 years old. Get one while you still can !!<br><br>
