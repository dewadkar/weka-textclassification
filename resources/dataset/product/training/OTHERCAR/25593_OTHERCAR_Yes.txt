            I am writing this article is to let you know about a great deal Saab has.  A lot of people don't know about some of the advantages European makers have by offering a European delivery option.  I reviewed Saab's, Volvo, Mercedes Benz and BMW's deal and written opinions on them as well.  I test drove all the cars before buying one. I ended up with a BMW M3 over the others but I highly recommend anyone buying a European car to see if they offer a European delivery option at the time of your purchase. 

By buying it here and doing European delivery you get the chance to tour a bit of Europe and save a little on your vacation.  If you go to Germany you can also drive fast legally on the autobahn. You should also check with two different dealerships if possible as some of them throw in extra perks.  I ended up getting a BMW and my dealer threw in an extra $1000 towards travel expenses, while the other dealer didn't, for the same car at the same price. There is only one Saab dealer in my town so I couldn't see if the offers varied with the dealership. You might also save on taxes depending on the state you live in. Saab also pays for the registration and zero deductible insurance for the time you drive it in Europe. I figure altogether I saved about $6000 on my car. 

The downside to European delivery is that it takes 4-8 weeks from the time you drop the car off in Europe to when you pick it up here in the states. You also get spoiled on the speed. When the car is delivered to the states they reprogram the cars computer so that you can't go as fast. 

Saab has a European delivery package where they pay for two round trip tickets to Stockholm and one or two night hotel stay depending on your flight arrival time.  Their website also has more information on this.

You can also do this if you are leasing a car.  The car itself is a nice well built and fairly priced automobile. One of the most overlooked features of the Saab is it's safety features. Saab is actually ranked higher than Volvo when it comes to safety. My ex-wife owns a Saab 9-3, she was involved in a crash which totaled the car but she walked away relatively unscathed.

The Saab 9-3 is a great entry level car for someone looking to step up into a sportier/luxury car.
