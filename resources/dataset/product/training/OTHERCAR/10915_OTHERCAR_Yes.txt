            When my wife and I began making money in earnest from all our hard work, we decided to the typical gen-X e-businessperson thing and reward ourselves with our first new car.

My wife, who was aesthetically challenged or perhaps just suffered from a temporary blindness, felt the BMW was &quot;too boxy&quot; and &quot;not very stylish.&quot;  She wanted a new Toyota Celica GT to replace our 93 Celica.

Then, I got her INTO a BMW 323is.  She promptly did a 180 degree about face and proceeded to inform me that she always liked BMWs. Uh huh.  I know that many women don't like to have their revisionist history challenged so I let it go at that.

We test drove a number of differently configured vehicles in the 3 lineup but settled on a sport 2-door (hence the &quot;s&quot; in its nomenclature).

The salesperson at Oklahoma City immediately underestimated our ability to purchase a BMW.  When we informed him of the other vehicles we were considering, such as the Celica and the VW Passat, he recognized that they were substantially cheaper than the 3-series. He probably estimated that we were too young and too poor to buy a new BMW.

He assured us that we should purchase a used BMW... perhaps the bargain basement 318.  When we pressed the issue, he informed us that there was no BMW 323is in the color we wanted anywhere within 300 miles of Oklahoma City.

The idiot probably didn't realize I had an automotive retail background and knew that this was ploy to get me to buy something on the lot.  Besides, I know that salespeople make oodles more money selling used cars to spineless consumers.

This is what happens when an auto dealer has a citywide monopoly.  They simply don't try to please the customer.  They act as if you can;t afford it if you have to ask the price.

So, my wife and I promptly headed for the more cosmopolitan, cultured and diverse city of Dallas, TX. There, we perused Toyotas but gravitated right into a well-appointed, yet spartan BMW dealership. The dealership was John Roberts BMW.

The salesperson took us on a solid test drive and showed the features and benefits.  We ended up getting a fully equipped Silver 323is with trip computer, leather, sport suspension, sunroof and the standard 3.5 liter inline six engine.  I enjoy the safety level it provides.  My wife, a native of Washington state, immediately appreciated its surefootedness in the rain... even without the optional traction control.  The vehicle inspires confidence but not overconfidence... which is good.

Forget what the BMW sriving machine snobs say... if you want an automatic... get it!  The BMW automatic is fantastic and sport mode is almost as fun as shifting manually.

No rattles or sqeaks except for an annoying vibration noise that emanates from the steering column when the engine hits 2 gear or 1500 rpm. This is easily fixable and apparently comes from a loose plastic shroud or minor part.  I'll have it looked at at the next service interval.

We leased the vehicle since we drive relatively little (work from home office).  It was a good deal but REMEMBER not to buy into the whole concept that you are insulting the nice salesperson by haggling.  Don't feel insecure about haggling for the leasing terms.  You may feel like you are exposing yourself as unqualfied to purchase such an elite vehicle but get the nerve up and do it anyway.

I've had the vehicle maintenanced once acording to the schedule.  By the terms of the lease BMW pays for all the service such as oild changes.  The personnel were courteous, knowledgable and professional.  The best in the business.  It's a pleasure to service my car, believe it or not.

If you put alot of stock into how a car feels, how solid the doors shut, how aligned the trim is, the overall fit and finish... consider the 323.<br><br>
