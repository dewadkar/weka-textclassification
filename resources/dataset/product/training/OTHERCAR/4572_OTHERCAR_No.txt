            I fell in love with the looks of this car when introduced in 96.  I vowed to own one.  So in January of 97 after a styling refresher of the model, I purchased one.  Bad mistake.  I thought I would give Dodge a try since they had supposedly changed their ways.  But, keep in mind this is a Mitsubishi/Chrysler built vehicle.  So, maybe Chrysler isn't entirely to blame.
The car handled great, could use more power, awesome stereo, and fun to drive.  The Pros end there.
We had this car in the shop monthly.  First it wouldn't give me my CD back.  The dealer wasn't authorized to stock these, so he had to take my radio/CD out and send it back to Chrysler.  After 3 weeks of no radio they put in a new one.  A few weeks later, the same thing happened and we went through the paces again to get a new one.  The second time around, it seemed OK.  In March of 97, pulled into Burger King and broke off the 'slider' plate on the bottom of the front bumper.  This is a really low car, maybe 2&quot; clearance!  Then by April of 97 I noticed that the doors were scrubbing the rocker panel when you closed them and was wearing the paint off.  I took it back to the dealer.  He informed me it was a common problem, sent out a big body shop guy who opened the doors and 'bent' them upward!  I was shocked!  By May of 97 I noticed a knock in the engine.  The dealer couldn't determine the cause and replaced many parts.  He finally requested a Chrysler rep to check it out. He inform us both that it was a common noise.  Well, that capped the stack.
I traded it in July of 97 for a Taurus LX (great car).<br><br>
