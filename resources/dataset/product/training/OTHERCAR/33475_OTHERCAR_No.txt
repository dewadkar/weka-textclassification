            We bought a 1991 Chevy Cavalier in 1995 for $3,000.  What a mistake.  It was the worst car ever owned and now sits in a state of frozen death in our yard!  We can't even trade it in and no one is interested in buying it.  Everything that could go wrong went wrong with this car.  Also, I have yet to see a Cavalier from the years 1990 to 1997 with its hub caps on!  Am I wrong??  Ha ha  Seriously, every Cavalier in my town and surrounding towns are all missing their hub caps including our Cavalier.  Coincidence?  We bought the vehicle because it was nice looking, easy on our pocket book and had good gas milage.  None of that is worth it if the car never runs right.  Think before you buy a Cavalier!<br><br>
