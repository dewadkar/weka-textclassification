            I bought my Neon because I thought they were cute from the moment they came out! And it was the only car that I could afford to buy brand new - at least one that I would drive. Right after I bought the car, I was a little worried that I would have all of these problems that I had heard about, but so far I have had few. My brakes started squeaking after about 2 months, but I hear there is nothing they can do about that. I had a recall on the driver's side airbag a week after I purchased the car and I got that taken care of right away.
When I took my car in to get my first oil change 3 months later, I also had to have them fix my sunroof because it had just stopped working. Luckily, this was covered under my warranty.
I would be very careful driving this car, because I am not sure how well it will stand up to any kind of an accident. I parked my car in a garage for the first year that I had it. My bicycle fell over about a foot and it's handle bar landed on the side of my Neon and dented it! So did my roommate's bike! So if two 8 pound bicycles can fall a total distance of one foot and dent this car, I would hate to see what a moving vehicle can do!
Other than this minor stuff, I have been pretty lucky with my car. It still runs, even after I neglected to get my oil changed for over a year! If this car can survive an owner like me, then it can't be all that bad.
This car is pretty nice to drive. It is alot quieter than my old car, less road noise, but the steering wheel is awfully close to the seat and having the back seat fold down is an option! I also have a spoiler on my car which makes it even more impossible to see out of the already too small back window.
I would do some research before buying a Neon. I would definitely buy a Dodge instead. Also, make sure you take care of it, and buy an extended warranty to cover yourself. It is well worth the money!<br><br>
