            I bought this for my family of 3 for long and short trips and good gas mileage. 
The car is fabulous for the money. Rides very quiet as is the engine. I am 6'4&quot; and have no problems in the drivers seat. The LE model has a power adjustable seat which does everything I want. It has plenty of room in the back for my teenage daughter and the trunk is cavernous. The LE comes with all power, 4 cupholders, fold down rear seat and cost less than $17K after the recent 1K rebate. How can you beat that. We shopped  many different cars and SUV's and this one was the best by far. 

This car is great for everyone and mileage is 30 highway. And reliablity is Toyota of course. My 1990 has 162K and still runs fine. <br><br>
