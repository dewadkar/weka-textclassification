            I have had a Ford Taurus sedan for a little under a year now and I cant really complain, because things could be worse. 
My particular model is a '92 GL Sedan with the larger 3.8L engine. Features in clude am/fm cassette, power windows, locks, drivers seat, Vanity mirrors, cupholder, coin tray and an exceptional amount of storage space inside. I like the 8-way power seat, and the coin organizer is a very conveinient feature.
The 1992 Ford Taurus sedan has a lot of nice features, and I do like this car overall. But this manufacturer has a tendency to stumble more often than not, and it shows-everything from poor fit-and-finish, to the idiotic ideas of an in dash cup holder in front of the radio on models with the bench seat.
Ergonomics, however, are a plus on this car. Large gauges and controls that are more 'user friendly' than on other cars in this class are a plus but they still dont make up for the excessive lack of craftsmanship in the cabin.
The cabin could be improved far above the state it is in. Plastic everywhere, lack of center console, and the planets worst cupholders are only a few of fords many, many, interior blunders. 
I do however recommend this car because regardless of the high mileage (150k), It has proved extremely safe and extremely reliable, and you cant argue with that.
