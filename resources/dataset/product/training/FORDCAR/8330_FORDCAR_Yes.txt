            In the summer of 98 my father bought a ford probe from my brother who was going away to college.  It was a 93 SE with a spoiler.
I, fortunately, had the opportunity to drive it most of the time.  
If you want a car that looks very nice and sporty, this is a great car.  With only a 4 cylinder engine, it had the get-go.  the GT will have a V6.  It's fun to race and turns heads when you drive through town.  It has a sleek body that cuts down on wind friction and handles very well.  Through the winter that I drove it, I had complete control.  It comes in a variety of colors and looks best with a spoiler.  It is very quiet and good on gas.  A nice convenience is also the rear seats that fold down to reveal the back.  This makes it nice if you plan to put in a nice stereo system.  For such a nice little car, you won't pay an arm and a leg, either, usually $4-12,000 for a 93 and up.
The only cons I can find is that they don't make them anymore, so parts might be a little less available than with a currently made car.  The other is a light body.  Unlike the firebirds and camaros, it is very light.  This is my particular preferred style, but for some, it doesn't feel as safe on sharp turns and very curvy roads.  I never had a problem in this area, though.  It also has very little room in the back seat, but this is to be expected in a sports car.<br><br>
