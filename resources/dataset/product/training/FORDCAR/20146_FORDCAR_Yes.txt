            What can I say about the 2000 Ford Windstar?
I was very hesitant to buy a minivan - I went kicking and screaming to the dealerships when I was looking.  I changed my mind after I test drove the Windstar.  I was afraid that driving a minivan would feel like driving a truck.  But after 3 months, I have to say with all honesty - I absolutely love it!  You feel like you are driving a sedan with all that extra seating and storage space.

It has a smooth drive, lots of nooks and crannies.  I have 3 children and countless trips to the grocery store, the soccer field, the beach, etc.  There is always room for more!

Plenty of storage space, cup holders, etc.  The stereo system sounds great.  My kids love the fact that they don't have to listen to my music and I don't have to listen to theirs thanks to the dual stereo system.  I love that fact that you are up high - you can see more around you.

I also love the reversing sensor.  It beeps while you are in reverse when it senses objects obstructing your way.  Great in the garage when you have bikes, etc. Also great in crowded parking lots.

The only thing that bugs me are the turn signals.  It is very hard to push down on the handle.

I test drove all of the other models out there - the Toyota Sienna, the  Dodge Caravan, the Honda Odyssey.  The Ford Windstar was the best choice and I don't regret my decision.  I wish I had bought this minivan years ago!
