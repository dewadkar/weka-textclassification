            	Ever since mid to late 1999 there has been controversy surrounding the SVT Cobra Mustang.  It isn't as powerful as advertised.  It is supposed to be putting out a whopping 320 Horsepower, but off the lot most of the cars are failing to achieve these numbers.  Instead the owners of the 99's have to put up with about 260-280 horses.  Now I agree that this is messed up and that Ford will fix and take care of all the 99 Cobras, but still I am having a blast with this car.
	I have an 89 Mustang GT along with this Cobra and the 89 is about 225 horsepower.  Now my 89 is fast at the 0-60, but when you get into the higher gears you just lose that umph! in the throttle.  Now the Cobra is the opposite.  Off the line this mustang is fast, but is lacking something.  That is where the recall comes in.  Ford is setting up free upgrades for the 99 Cobra owners free of charge.  The upgrade will include a new Intake Manifold, fuel chip, and exhaust system.  But I can wait for those upgrades, even though I would like to experience the full SVT car.
	Now the real fun in this car so far though, is 1.) The Sound of the roaring V-8 2.) The Mach 460 Soundsystem 3.) It may be 260 hp, but this thing is still a very quick automobile.  When you are in the first and second gears, you don't get much from the motor, but hit third gear and the engine opens up and you feel like you are tearing through all the traffic on the road.  Opening up the throttle on this car is a sound that would make any car enthusiast smile.  When you hit the Fourth and fifth gears you can accelerate from around 80 to 120 in a very quick time.  With the gear ratio in this car being quite large, I would guess a 3.73:1 or possible 4:1 you can rev it quite high without any fear of hitting a redline.  In long stretches of road I would take fourth gear to about 5000 rpm's at about 120 mph before shifting to fifth and then coming back down.
	Although the Ford fix should be coming in January (which I am very excited for) I can put up with this car.  Although the stock suspension seems very high up.  It corners fairly well, but I plan on dropping the suspension down a little bit, so that it will corner better.<br><br>
