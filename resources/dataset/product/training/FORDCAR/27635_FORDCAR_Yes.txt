            I ordered my XLT in December, it came in March. A couple of trips to the dealer already for the engine light. Lots of trouble with the vapor management/recovery system, but it seems to be taken care of. Dealer support was excellent. I considered other small SUVs, but they didn't have anywhere near the interior room of the Escape. Detail work on the interior and exterior is very good. I got the Mach audio system with the in-dash 6 disk player, and the sound is great. Neat effects (hall, church, jazz club) and centering the audio on the driver seat, or all seats is a nice feature.
Mileage is currently about 26 MPG (4 cyl, 5 speed), but I expect this to improve as the engine breaks in. Currently have about 1100 miles on the vehicle and I find the controls: turn signal, wiper, cruise control, etc. are very convenient and similar to the Ford Escort of the 90s.
The gasoline fill cap is a bit unusual. It only requires a 1/8 turn to remove and replace. This is a bit confusing and unlike any other car I've ever seen. I anticipate a lot of trouble at full service gas stations. I put the gas in myself, so having mastered the technique, it should not be a problem. It makes you wonder though, why they would use this design cap when everyone is used to the old style where you tighten it until you hear some clicks, and you're done.
