            I purchased my Focus used.  It's a 2001 SE 4-door with the optional Sport package (includes tachometer, leather steering wheel, spoiler, fog lights and the nice Zetec engine).  Mine also has antilock brakes, power windows, automatic power door locks, cruise control, single CD player, air conditioning, etc.

Curiously, my car also has daytime running lights (must have been originally sold in Canada).  I have seen no other Focus models with this feature.  Another interesting feature is rear seat headrests, something I've never seen on other SE 4-doors, even the Sport package models.

PERFORMANCE:  The Zetec engine is no thrill, but it provides reasonably quick acceleration even with the automatic transmission.  It's a surprisingly smooth and quiet engine, too, especially compared to the Escort's old 1.9L engine (remember those?).  The automatic provides prompt downshifts and isn't a huge detriment in overall driveability.  NOTE:  Running the air conditioner makes for notably slower acceleration.  Brakes are strong, though they do tend to squeal at times.  Handling is more sport coupe than economy car and is aided by razor-sharp steering.  Ride quality is pretty good, smooth enough to be comfortable for longer trips. 

INTERIOR:  Front seats are comfortable, despite needing adjustable lumbar supports (hint, hint, Ford).  There is an amazing amount of headroom and rear seat legroom is pretty good.  The dash takes some getting used to, but the climate and audio controls are placed high and are easy to use, with a quality feel that I thought only Honda capable of.  There is an abundance of plastic inside, but little of it looks or feels cheap.  My car has a few rattles, but nothing is misaligned - which seems to be rare for a small, low-priced American car.  Noise levels are not objectionable, but the car does seem to be a tad noisier than it should be.  A gripe:  the rear seat backs are split and fold, but the bottom is NOT split!  Not very convenient.

TRUNK:  Big.  Holds quite a bit of groceries, actually.  A nice feature:  the hinges are actually struts, and they don't hang down into the trunk area!  Cool idea.

FUEL ECONOMY:  I usually drive a 50/50 mix of city and highway, so I don't exactly know what the City and Highway MPG is.  But I usually get about 29 mpg, though I have got up to 31-mpg before.  Since the EPA rates Focus at only 32-mpg Highway, I think the 29-mpg average isn't half bad.  I have no idea how much more efficient the standard engine is, but the Zetec's penalty (if any) in economy is worth it for the added zip it has.

PROBLEM AREAS:  So far, my car has not been subject to any recalls.  However, there are some quality control issues that Ford needs to address.  My car has had the following work done, all under warranty:
1.  Driver side headlight replaced due to condensation forming inside.
2.  The horn inexplicably quit working.
3.  The engine vibrates a little when coming to a stop, dealer says can't find anything wrong.
4.  Brakes squeal a bit.
5.  Engine "whistles" if crusing at 30-mph and I take my foot off the throttle.  Weird, but dealer says can't find any problem.

Also, the Focus has a lot of front brake dust!

Overall, it's a great car with minor gripes at best.  And it's noticeably less expensive than a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla.  For those of us on a budget, that's a good thing.
