            In 1998 I looked at a new Taurus and was impressed by the comfort and the handling of the car but I could not get over the looks of the car. I ended up buying a Mustang at that time and was very happy with the car. Ford quality has definitely improved. I never had a problem with the Mustang in 50k miles of driving. So when I recently had to get a larger car for business I went down to the Ford dealership again and saw the new 2000 Taurus. Gone is the fishy looking front end, oval rear window, oval console and droopy rear end. 

The new Taurus styling is on par with other sedans in it's class. The rear end is lifted and rear taillights are more modern and angular. Front end is sleek with large halogen headlights. 

The comfort and handling is still there! I bought the LX model with the option package which adds cruise control and alloy wheels. 

Inside the seats are large and supportive. The center console flips out as on the previous model but this time it lays flat instead of at an angle. The oval console is gone replaced by a more streamlined look.

Head and legroom are ample for me at 6'3&quot; I never feel cramped even on long trips. Pickup is great, the car has plenty of power for passing. The transmission shifts smoothly. The included keyless entry with remote trunk release is very convenient. 

Best of all was the price. At $17,500 after rebate this car was only a few thousand more than the new Focus and you get alot more car for the money. 

The quick release gas cap with tether makes going to the pump easier. Although I really wish Ford would include a locking gas lid on their vehicles.

On the road the car feels stable. The car is sure footed in turns. Brakes are responsive and firm. 

To be fair I did test drive the Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima, Buick Century, Chevrolet Malibu, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata and Saturn LS. Then I went back and bought the Taurus. I felt the Taurus was the best car for the money in this class overall. With the new styling and the same high quality I think Ford can regain the market share it has given up over the past few years. Try one out I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!
