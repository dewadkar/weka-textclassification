            The long-awaited Ford Excursion has got to be the most ridiculous vehicle cluttering our freeways and suburban streets today.  A certain family member INSISTED on having one and let me tell you, it is the worst SUV I have ever had the displeasure to drive. 

For one, the thing is a grade-A, unadulterated GAS GUZZLER, getting a whopping 8 miles to the gallon or something like that, which can get expensive with gas prices the way they are. Also, the thing is totally unmaneuverable in any kind of remotely tight spot - even a semi-truck driver relative of mine had difficulty wrestling the beast into a tight parking spot on a family outing.

Bottom Line - No one should EVER need a vehicle this big, I don't care how many kids you have or how many soccer teams you cart around, this is a clumsy vehicle that is an absolute menace on the roadways, as it can simply roll right over smaller cars. If you MUST join the suburban bandwagon and get an SUV, please opt for a smaller one that can meet emissions standards. I hate to sound bitter, but I must say this monster vehicle is quite a disappointment.<br><br>
