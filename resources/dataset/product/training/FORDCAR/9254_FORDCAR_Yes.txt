            This is one of the best small sports sedans made, and without a doubt the best value.  It's not for everyone:  you've got to like driving (and that means lots of gear shifting), but if it's performance you want, this Ford Contour SVT is the ticket.  It won't work for hauling a lot of stuff or bigger kids (too cramped in the back), but if you need a good commuter/weekend sporter, try it out.

I'll never understand why Ford discontinued the Contour SVT for the 2001 model year--it's simply a superb car.  It isn't perfect, of course:  the back seat is too tight, and it's noisy at speed, mainly due to the high-performance tires.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles you'll find on a VW Passat or an Audi A6--but you don't have to pay for them, either.  At $22,000 (no haggle price), it is one of the best automotive values out there, a true driver's car.

Before I bought mine, I tried just about everything of comparable size and performance:  VW's, Audis, BMW's, to name just a few.  The Contour SVT isn't as sophisticated as the VW and Audi (about the same as a BMW 328), but the price difference more than makes up for that.

And talk about performance!  This thing handles as well as any sports sedan on the market (though I must admit, the ride is just a little harsh).  The car accelerates like a rocket, especially above 4,000 r.p.m., and the brakes haul you down nicely from speed.  

The interior is tasteful, though not luxurious.  The six-way perforated leather driver's seat works well and provides excellent support, though the electric switch at the forward edge of the seat is in an awkward location.  The radio/CD and speaker system work well (though the radio controls are certainly not intuitive, and take some getting used to before you can locate them by touch).  

Everything works the way it should.  This is probably the most underrated performance sedan on the road today, and Ford's SVT team should be congratulated--they really got it right.  If you are in the market for a sports sedan and are more interested in value than in "prestige," you owe it to yourself to test drive one of these.

Well, I'm back after a year to tell you how it's all worked out.  The SVT is wearing well, with a couple of nits to report.  First, the thing is so low (with the add-on plastic air dams) that encounters with curbs and parking lot separators periodically result in scrapes and dings to the paint.  The radio controls drive me CRAZY -- worse design I've ever seen.  A simply analog tuner would be infinitely better.  As for quality, things have held up pretty well, except the Southern California sun coming through the windshield caused the plastic dash covering around the defroster vents on top of the dash to come lose halfway across.  We'll see what the dealer does with this.  Other than that, this thing is a great daily driver, if you don't mind a little work.  Maintenance has been limited to the aforesaid nits and the routine scheduled stuff.  Absolutely NO unpleasant surprises, at all.  All-in-all, I'm still a satisfied buyer.
