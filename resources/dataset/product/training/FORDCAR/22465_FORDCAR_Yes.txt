            I own a 1999 Range XLT Super Cab. It's loaded to the hilt for a Ranger. I have bucket seats, duel-media stereo, comfort package, power options, limited slip rear differential, the 4.0L V-6, 4.10 rear axle ratio and my personal favorite the 4-door option. 
My little truck has been pleasing in almost every experience I have had. The interior is fairly urged and comfortable. the power options are a convenience that have held up so far. The stereo has exceptional sound for being stock. The only problem I've had are with the windshield wipers unexpectedly going off for one or two cycles, however, the instances are few and far between. The smaller size bed as opposed to a full size truck can be a problem when loading large or ockward objects.
Many say the Ranger is underpowered. I would disagree with them some what in the fact that the ranger 4.0L produces 160HP, which is less than the GM or dodge counter parts. It still delivers the Torque desired to handle any job with in range of a V-6 engine. The 4.10 axle ration makes the truck slow off the line so to speak. However, it allows it to handle most loads and terrain with out breaking a sweat. 
My truck handles like a dream on the road. I travel very often on the free way at 65-75 MPH and even with the 16&quot;wheels I'm pleased with its performance. As far as off-road is concerned I have had it on dirt roads and in the snow in 4x4 and it's a joy to drive. I have had no problems except of once in a parking lot in 2x4 mode where I did a 360, but I was asking for it.
