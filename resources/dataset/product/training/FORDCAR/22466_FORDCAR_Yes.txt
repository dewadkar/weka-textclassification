I used to call myself a loyal Toyota gal, but no more.  Ford means BUSINESS - they want to sell trucks and it SHOWS.  My Ranger is awesome value for the price.  Got everything I really wanted for a better price than a Toyota truck.  I don't like a lot of bells &amp; whistles in autos, and I especially don't like being forced into packages of extraneous stuff just because I also want, for instance, A/C.  What I got is: extended cab, A/C, 4WD Automatic, and gotta love that V6.  And extra niceties like intermittent wipers.  And 0.9% financing at the time.  On top of all that, even though I was desparate cuz my Toyota truck totally died, I was not taken advantage of my the salesperson at all, in fact got a better deal than I thought possible.  And after walking into the showroom, they prepped a truck for me on the spot - 2 hours later, I drove out a brand new Ford Ranger.  Since then, well, let me say I had no idea a truck can drive as nice as this, and I also had NO CLUE what a difference 4WD can make, and on the fly no less!  I am in love with this truck!  How does Ford do it?  They had to cut corners somewhere, didn't they?  Well, maybe I did find one itsy bitsy tradeoff - the external body is maybe a bit touchy, paint and metal.  Example:  One day I pushed my door open, and very gently holding it in my hand, had to rest it against the next car's side mirror ... it created a teeny little dent.  I mean it was not even a touch, I had the door IN MY HAND.  Also, Ford did have to replace the entire arm of wiper/signal lights, my wipers would go on intermittently and spontaneously, it was freaky.  But they did that free, their option to replace, not mine, and no hassles, no questions asked.  The dealership where I go, Monaco Ford, in Glastonbury, CT, has got the nicest, cleanest, most professional service department I have ever seen.
