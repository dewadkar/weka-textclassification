            Bought a used 1996 Ford Windstar van in August 1997. The van had 16,000
miles on it &amp; went with an extended warranty (since it was used). It was a big improvement over our Mercury Sable (newer style). Last fall we noticed
that the transmission would change gears while going up &amp; down hills. We took it to a Ford dealer (I knew that there was a technical bulletin out on this problem) and they replaced the entire transmission ! Thank heaven
for extended warranty. That was the only problem we've had. Still going at 60,000 miles.

Make sure the middle seat doesn't move around in it's track (very annoying).

p.s. If you highly recommend this review , I get paid.
