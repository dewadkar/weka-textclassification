            The Ford Ranger is obviously the veteran of the compact truck market and is obviously the most &quot;bang for your buck&quot; Great off-road package for everyone that loves to turn their boring street truck into a &quot;Ranger for Danger&quot; off-road project. Great gas mileage, very nice horsepower from 146 @ 3,000 rpms to 180 @ 3,750 rpms. it is a great truck, Ford has always been the best in the compact truck market compared to Dodge and Chevy. The only thing i see wrong with the Ford Ranger is the manual style mirrors......now my opinions on those are that i rather have electric styled mirrors for obvious reasons....but your opinion might be different. But overall this truck is a perfect truck for ANYONE so if u have some money to burn.....check this truck out!<br><br>
