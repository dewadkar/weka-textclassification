            Bought my 95 Ranger XLT new.  I have put over 180,000 miles (estimated, one of the few things that broke was the odometer, although the speedo still works) on it, with only the occasional failure.  Sure, some things are starting to break now, and they can cost more than a few cents to repair, but what do you want for 180,000 HARD miles.  I have driven this vehicle pretty hard, and am very pleased with it's dependability.  About as simple a vehicle as can be sold these days, which adds to it's fairly low cost of ownership and repair.  The truck, esp. with the 2.3 liter 4-cylinder, is way low on power, but it can get out of it's own way.  As for towing/carrying, I have no real complaints- I have loaded my truck up several times.  Even towed a '73 Mustang on a tow dolly (about a 4000 pound load!) from New Orleans to Atlanta, with no problems (not recommended, but only because of tow-dolly-induced fishtailing, which can put the unwary driver in the ditch- no fault of the truck if the driver ask that much more of it than it was designed to deliver).  Yes, top speed is only about 98 mph.  The only thing to be aware of is that the '95's have late-OBD-1 ("On-Board Diagnostics, generation 1") engine diagnostic systems, and test equipment is hard to come by.  That is no doubt the complaint another reviewer was so upset about.  Most independent shops don't want to spend the money on test equipment that can be used on very few cars (95 Rangers and Aerostar Vans), and you can hardly blame them.  Best advise about this- call around town and find a shop that does have test equipment for a 95 Ranger, and give him all your repair business, even if it's not engine performance related.  Just ask him to please not sell or give away his test equipment that works on your truck!

If I were to buy a Ranger again (and I probably will) I'd opt for the 4.0 liter six cylinder, extended cab, but would go with the 5-speed manual trans, like I did this time.  HIGHLY recommended.
