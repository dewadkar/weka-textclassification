            I used to own a 1991 Escort, 2 door hatchback, 5 speed stick,  V4 engine. It was not a fancy car, but it got me where I needed to go.

My model didn't have many extras. I don't know how I ever managed without power windows or cruise control. But that little car never failed me. It gave me no trouble at all. True, it would start to shake if you got it over 80 mph, but it's an Escort, not a Mustang. Power was not it's thing.

The interior was laid out nicely. I always hate the fact that automatic cars get a tach but for a stick it's an &quot;option&quot;. I didn't have one. Dash controls were easy to find and use, lit with a nice orange glow. Glove box was big enough, and door pockets were ok. I hated the tray in front of the stick for 2 drinks and a pencil. It was molded plastic with a removable rubber lining. Half the time the lining came up with your drink. Don't ever wash the lining in hot water or it warps. And you can't use it without the lining.

Back seat was okay for 2 adults, 3 would be pushing it. It had a split down rear seat, very nice and useful. Hatch area was good enough to hold 3 suitcases, and it had a removable cover. Spare was under the hatch floor. 

Mine was white, and I will never but another white car. First, it's so hard to get it to look clean, and after a few years (and I did take good care of this car) the white started to look chalky. So don't get a used one in white. The interior was red, and it held up well, even in the sun (poor car spent 3 years without a garage to put it in).

This car now would make a good first car for your 16 year old. I found it dependable and easy to maintain. I only got rid of it because our family expanded and I needed a 4 door car. And I replaced it with a Ford Contour, and really miss my Escort (Contour bites).
