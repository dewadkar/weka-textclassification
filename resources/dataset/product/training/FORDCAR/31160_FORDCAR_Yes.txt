            Three words &quot;Ow My God&quot;!!!!!    This is the best car ford has ever produced. I was a loyal Chevy man but after buying this GT how can i ever evan look at another &quot;bow-tie&quot; (thats slang for chevrolet).  With 295 horsepower from the factory this baby really scoots. Also with the touriong suspension you would never know now you was in a sports car, you would think you was in a Cadillac.  With a5.0 or 4.6 engine it is very easy to upgrade your new mustang for evan more power than what it has when you drive it off the lot. you dont have to settle for a 5 liter or 4.6 you can the Cobra or saleen  edition  they come with evan more power from the factory. Great gas mileage also  as long as you keep your foot off the floor. hahaha   I have that problem. it is a very good investment for under 25,000(thats for the cobra the most expensive)  Well i hope this  will help anyone is thinking about buying a new mustang if you was to e-mail me i would be more than happy to send you pictures of mine and tell you the mods ive made to mine so far.  thanks<br><br>
