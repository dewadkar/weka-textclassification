            This is my second Ford F350 Dually with the powerstroke diesel.Its a 1997 super cab.I pull a fifth wheel camper that weigh's close to 16000 pounds and this is what I did to make this truck a pulling brute.First I did away with the factory turbo down pipe which is a joke and installed a Banks down pipe which lets the engine run cooler and build boost faster.Next I installed Bank's computer chip named &quot;OTTO MINDER&quot; this gives this truck the kick in the pants it needs,also firms up the shift and changes the shift point.Also I installed a K&amp;N air filter to let the engine breath more.To top it all off, I installed the triple gauge set from Torq-Line which includes a pyrometer,boost gauge and trans temp.Now I know exactly what my engine is doing on long hill's.I forgot to add, this truck has a E4oD transmission and a Limited slip 4:10 gear.I hope this might help someone planning to buy a used truck for serious pulling.<br><br>
