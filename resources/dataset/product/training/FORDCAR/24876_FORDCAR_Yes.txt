            Strengths: Strong engine. Low end torque. On of a kind exhaust note. Cheap aftermarket parts. Bad looking. Acceptable supportive seats. Cold A/C (when it was working). It can be a very fast car with little mods. Fun in rain and snow. Easy to work on. 
Weaknesses: Weak 5 speed transmission.
Loves gas (93 octane because of the timing advance).
Interior rattles and leaks.
Too much fun in rain and snow (what's up with that sudden oversteer?).
Road and wind noise.
No damn cup holders.
Damn cops magnet.
Drum rear brakes.
I hate the Overdrive 5th gear.
What I'm supposed to do with the 85 miles speedometer?
Too much firm suspention. 
No down force! (lift generate when going 100+ mph).
Live rear axle.
15" wheels cant be cleand.

 
Compared To: 88 Vette
95 Firebird
96 911 cab. 
Review Summary: -The engine lacks high-end horsepower. A Ford Racing GT-40 intake seems to solve the problem.
-The origenal T5 blowup, it was replaced with a rebuilt one which blowup after 19K miles, Now I have Ford Racing super-heavy-duty T5 which said to have more torque capacity. It seems to work well, I like it's 2.95:1 ratio first gear, it gets the car to 50 miles on the standard 3.08 rear end, but it has a taller than stock fifth gear.
-I changed the front tires to Pirelli's 8000 series. They work like magic. The car charecter has changed. 95% of the understeer is gone, now it oversteers like crazy.
-The sound system sucks, I replaced the speakers and installed a Sony piece and a 10 CD changer. It really cranks now.
-I LOVE this car, aftermarket offers many replacement parts, from a steering wheel with cruise cotrol bottoms to a rear independent suspention (which can be installed from the Cobra with some mods).
