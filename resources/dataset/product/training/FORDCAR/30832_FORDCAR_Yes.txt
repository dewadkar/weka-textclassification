            I had been coveting a Ford Explorer for several years before I finally found a way to get one in 95. I don't even remember why I was attracted to the Explorer, but I did check out all of the other SUV competition at that time and found that I liked the feel of the inside of the car above all others. It seemed to be just the right size and shape for me. I liked the head room, the leg room, the body room, and the layout inside. I also felt very safe in a car this size that rode much higher than the VW Rabbit, BMW 2002, and ancient Toyota pick up I had previously driven. I still find the ride wonderfully smooth, and the car very easy to handle.

I know nothing nothing nothing about cars. That makes me either a very credible person on this subject, or an incredibly non-credible one. But just to sound like I almost understand my subject, I did cull through every single repair receipt I have collected since March of 95 when I signed on the dotted lease line.

The reason for this sudden reflection on my vehicle is that my 5 year lease will expire in a few months, and suddenly I am very tempted to keep this thing. When I got it, it had only one previous owner, local to where I was then living. It also had only 33,000 miles on it. Not bad for a four year old car, right? Well, today, almost 5 years later, it still has under 73,000. Not bad for a nine year old car, right? (I have nothing to compare it to, but I am told that is low mileage). 

My current problem is, I threw away all of my copies of the Consumer Reports Car Issues. From what I recall, the 91 had the potential for the worst problems, in almost every system and &quot;major organ&quot;. It was the first year for the Explorer, and I remember my relief as I looked at all the things that could, and probably would, eventually go wrong with it, smugly thinking: &quot;no, not YET...&quot; I am now fearing that if I do purchase it,  those &quot;yets&quot; may suddenly become my &quot;nows&quot;.

I did experience a problem from the get go that I learned was common: a bad paint job! It started peeling and flaking off, although not as badly as some of the stories I have heard. The after-market air conditioning unit that I had installed as part of the lease has never worked, and after taking it to 4 different mechanics, I have given up. 

I quickly put new tires on it, for I was leaving the California coast, headed for my new country life at 7000 snowy and icy feet. Of course, being the chicken I am, it took the absolute inability to get up my own driveway for me to break down and get comfortable with the 4x4 system. And that was one of the first things I realized desperately needed fixing. It seemed I needed a new motor for the 4x4 system. Why I didn't ask to test drive it with the 4x4 engaged can only be attributed to my incredible naivety, stupidity, and low self image around all things electric and mechanical. 


The Explorer moved me and 4 cats from Monterey, CA to Santa Fe, NM, pulling a large Uhaul trailer behind us. And then it moved me and 5 cats (I collect!) to Colorado shortly thereafter. Never a break down, never a problem, save for the chronically inconsistent air conditioning that refused to work somewhere near Palm Springs in September, and then somewhere near Santa Fe the following June. (I do not recommend moving one's self and 4 or 5 very agitated cats in Summer months without A/C, just for reference).

Without counting any minor parts, repairs, or standard maintenance, it seems from my receipts that the biggest expenses have come from the replacement of:  left axle seal, right axle seal, shaft, pinion, gear (did I say all that right? The receipts mean nothing to me the way they are written!), MAF sensor, plugs, ignition cable, fuel pump, power steering pump, and the 4x4 motor. All of that is somewhere over $2,000. I hear friends talk of dropping $2,000 on car repairs at one pop. I suddenly feel very lucky that this has all occurred over almost a 5 year period.

So, now I have to decide how lucky I feel with my 91 Explorer. If I turn it in, however, it will only be to splurge on a newer model Explorer. What I drive, how it looks, and how trendy it may be mean little to me. What means everything to me is the ability to comfortably travel long distances alone, with relative confidence that I will be travelling safely and won't be sitting on the side of busy highways using my AAA benefits.
