            Excursion barges into showrooms for 2000 as the world's biggest, heaviest
    sport-utility vehicle. Against the previous title-holder, the Chevrolet Suburban,
    Excursion is 7.4 inches longer on a 7-inch-longer wheelbase. It stands about 6
    inches taller and is some 1900 pounds heavier. 

    Based on Ford's 3/4-ton F-Series pickup truck, Excursion seats up to nine,
    has four side doors, and center-opening rear half-doors below a one-piece
    top-hinged tailgate window. It comes in XLT and Limited models, both with 2-
    or 4-wheel drive. Automatic transmission and 4-wheel antilock disc brakes are
    standard. 

    A V8 is the base engine. A V10 is standard with 4WD and optional with 2WD.
    Available with either drivetrain is a turbocharged diesel V8. The 4WD system
    shifts between 2WD and 4-high and 4-low via a dashboard switch, but is not
    for use on dry pavement. General Motors rivals and Ford's Expedition offer
    full-time 4WD that need not be disengaged on dry pavement. <br><br>
