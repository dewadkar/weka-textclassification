            I bought my Ranger STX in 1994, My kids were still small and I needed a truck. The Ranger extended Cab has two jumpseats on the back that face each other this is just enough room for a 12 year old with short legs.
The sport Bucket seats for the driver and passenger although are far better, both seats provide power lumbar, leg and waist support, very nice. 
interior options are a plus, the STX Package includes-- Power windows, locks, mirrors, cruse control and Tilt wheel. Dash is easy to read and well lit at night.

My Ranger STX had the 4.0 liter V-6 with 5-speed manual transmission, I had several problems with the Mazda Trans. At 36,000 and 70,000 miles I had to have slave and master clutch cylinders replaced at 75,000 I had the rear main seals replaced. The V-6 engine was strong and gave this small truck alot of pep although it drank gas like my brother-in-law downed cappachinos. Average city/highway was 15.5 not very good for a small truck. The Front end is also another story, it was very hard to keep the front end aligned. During the 6 years of ownership I had the front end aligned 15 times. The A/C was very cold, this was the first year that manufactures offered the new non-cfc coolant, I had no problems with the A/C. Also the engine offered out no problems, first tune up was at 75,000 just as advertised and the cost was under $100. I had done the work myself, It was easy to do. All spark plugs are easy to remove with no special tools and the uni-belt was a two min. job.    

overall, I liked driving the Ranger, It handled very well on the open road and in the city, Parking was not a problem because the visability was very good with minor blind spots. 

Personal Crash Test:(Side Impact)
I was in an accident with my Ranger in April, I was broadsided by a Ford F-250 at 45 mph, I was surprised how well the truck took the impact, the drivers door and J-post were pushed in about 14in and the cab shifted 
off the frame only 6in. I walked away with little injury. this is a strong    truck for it's size although The truck was a total loss. I was also surprised how well the Ranger retained it's value, I paid 13,646 in 1994, 6 years later and 80,000 miles, the insurance pay-off was $9200. <br><br>
