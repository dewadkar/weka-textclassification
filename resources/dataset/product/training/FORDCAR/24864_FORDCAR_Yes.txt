            The new, 2000 Ford Mustang is a great car.  It is good looking, handles quite well, gets great gas mileage, it is fun to drive, and to my great surprise, it was very affordable.

The interior is quite comfortable, it has both driver- and passenger-side airbags, and even though the trunk opening is rather small, the trunk space itself is immense.

I was pleasantly surprised that the Mustang came with both cassette and CD players.  It is nice to have a media option.

The only drawback that I found with the Mustang is the back seat leg-room, it is almost non-existent.  If you have more than two people riding in the car, it might get a little cramped.<br><br>
