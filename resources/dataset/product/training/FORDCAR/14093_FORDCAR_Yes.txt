            I own a 1994 Mustang GT 5 speed. It now currently has 68,000 <i>hard</i> miles on it, and it runs flawlessly.

<b>Engine & Drivetrain</b>
The 1994 Mustang GT still has the venerable 5.0L Ford OHV V8. This engine while stock, does not make the same hp as the newer style Camaro's, it is very easily upgraded to very respectable hp levels. It gets good gas mileage for a large V8, and I average about 20mpg. This is with a more aggressive driving pattern, and some modifications that definitely do not help gas mileage. 

The Borg-Warner T-5 transmission has been in use for a long time in the Mustang, and with well deserved respect. While it does not like lots of hp, it will tolerate the the stock hp level of a 1994 Mustang GT with ease for many many miles. The shifter is somewhat notchy, and 3rd gear engagement is imprecise. Luckily, there are at least a half dozen aftermarket companies that make very quality short throw shifters that make banging the gears very enjoyable.

<b>Handling</b>
Now, remember that this Mustang is based off the 1978 Ford Fairmont. It doesn't ride like a Lexus, nor should it. However, it is much improved over the creaky Fox body models, and has very much improved 4 wheel disc brakes, with ABS. 
It will understeer if pushed into a corner, but this is easily counteracted with a moderate amount of throttle application.
I do not suggest attempting to drive this Mustang in anything other than dry weather. It, like most high torque rwd cars, likes to oversteer if sufficient traction is not available. This makes for in the least, exciting driving when weather conditions are not optimal. 

<b>Summary</b>
If you like to go fast, but don't enjoy modifying your car save up for a Corvette or Viper. If you take pride in creating a car that is true to the American spirit of dollar:hp, than a 1994 Mustang may be for you. With the aftermarket available for the 5.0 Mustangs the sky is the limit. Given enough time and the right know-how this Mustang GT can run with cars that cost 3 times what they did, but it takes some modifying of the car to do.

If you are wondering if whether a Mustang is for you, then don't. Just go drive one. If after the drive you leave the car thinking of all the possibilities, and you can't wipe that smile off your face you have your answer.
