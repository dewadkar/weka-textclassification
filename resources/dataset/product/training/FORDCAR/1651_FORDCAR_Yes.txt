            Man, I'll tell you, Ford really went out on a limb with this one, but they succeeded with this one. It's a really winner pack with luxury and everything you could every want.

Ever since Chevrolet's giant success story, the Suburban, was revamped a few years ago it has been a battle of Detroit's Big 3 for the <b>BIGGEST</b> family car producible. The Suburban was an amazingly designed car with the room and comfort for seven passengers and some cargo space. Then Ford and Chrysler countered with the Expedition and the Durango: enlarged versions of the Explorer and Jeep. Since then it has been a struggle to ram more space into these cars to attract more people. Then Ford shocked the automotive nation in the fall of 1998 with their announcement of an oversized Expedition dubbed the Excursion. 

This 19 foot long beast sends vibrations miles down the road. Whether you opt for the economical 5.4 liter, eight cylinder with 255 horses or the monstrous 6.8 liter, ten cylinder with twin valves and 310 powerful horses behind it, they will know when you show up to pick the kids up from school. Heck, you can take the whole darn neighborhood home: It has room for eight passengers, plus the cargo space for all the possible projects and bookbags that they could be carrying! 

Now lets be honest, when you have a car that is 19ft x 8ft x 8ft, you're going to run into some problems such as steering the darn boat. However, Ford really pulled through and give you the comfort, control and handling of a car, but it really looks worse than it is. And that's a definite plus. When I first looked at the car, I thought to myself, 'Its just to much, I like the idea but they won't pull it off,' but they did!

And if you want luxury, this puppy sure has it, with a base price of just over $40,000 you can opt for the Limited Edition 4X4, which comes with every feature you could imagine. It come loaded with air conditioning, a rear defogger and even heated side mirrors. Believe me if there is ice on any glass on this car: its coming off. Ford also makes sure that every available amenity is on this to make your driving experience more like that of a car with power everything: windows, locks, mirrors, antenna, steering and even seats, which by the way are all Leather in this sweet ride. And because Ford is such a major player in the industry, they're loaded you up with all the safety features you need to protect you, your loved ones and even your car. They've put in dual side air bags, 4-wheel Anti-lock Disc brakes and a Keyless entry with an Anti-theft system. Not to mention that this car's powerful frame and body are going to stand up to a lot in the unlikely event of an accident. Last, if you have kids you know that the most important thing really is how easy is it to take on trips? Well, the last two rows of seats fold down so you can vary your seating capacity from 4 to 6 to 8 and if you have it down to 4 you're gonna have enough space to carry a small army in the trunk. Plus, its got an Am/FM radio with both cassette and CD player and its easily upgradeable privately to have television/VCR/Game System capabilities. What's more, the cruise control, tilt steering and four speed automatic transmission really makes trips a nonevent.
