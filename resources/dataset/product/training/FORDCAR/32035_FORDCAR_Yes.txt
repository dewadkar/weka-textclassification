            What to say about a Ford Explorer?!  They are wonderful!  Very comfortable to ride in, easy to pack up the kids and just go!  You don't have to worry about how you are going to fit everything into the vehicle when you are going on a long trip!  I just love it!
We have 3 boys...and they just love it too!  They have enough room to roam around in!  The doors automatically lock, which is sooo wonderful! and it has seatbelts everywhere!  That's what I like to see in a SUV or any other vehicle for that matter.  
How hot/cold is it outside?!  No need to roll down the window and check! It shows you right there in your vehicle.  The kids get a kick out of that!  Not comfortable in your seat?  Add a little cushioning!  
We have taken numerous trips w/ our Explorer and haven't had a problem with it yet!  The trips always seem shorter then before and the kids aren't fighting all the time!   I just love it!
