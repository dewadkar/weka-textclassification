            My husband and I own a 1993 Ford Tempo 4 door that we purchased new.  My husband, who can never have enough power, got the optional 6 cylinders over the standard 4 cylinders, power steering, power brakes, power locks, power mirrors.....you get the idea.

This car was purchased shortly before we got married, and I must say, it has adjusted well to the changing demands we've put on it over the years.  Parents will be surprised to know that the backseat will fit 3 carseats across.  Singles will like knowing that even though it's no longer the hot new car it once was, Ford Tempos really don't look boxy or dated.

Our Tempo has, brace yourself, 185,000+ miles on it.  We live in the south, our families are diehard yankees, and we do some traveling.  

Now to the ugly realities of putting that kind of mileage on a car, any car.  At about 120,000 it threw a rod and took out part of the engine, cost us $1400 to fix.  Last year we replaced the engine completely with one that had only 55,000 miles on it, and I seem to have blanked out the cost of that little repair, probably in the interest of preserving my sanity.  We're about to get all new brakes, and it's not the first time for that either.

That said, with as hard as we've run this car, it's almost hard to resent the repairs and maintenance costs.  The 6 cylinder engine is a lot of fun, especially when you're stopped at a light next to some show off sports car that wants to tango and doesn't realize you've got POWER under the hood.  However, parts can be harder to find for the 6 cylinder, and repairs can cost more.

The interior is surprisingly roomy, and my husband, who is 6 foot 3 inches drives this car comfortably.  I am a full foot shorter, and I find that when I pull the seat all the way forward to reach the pedals it can put me closer to the steering wheel than I'd like.  When I was pregnant I had to tilt the wheel way up like a school bus wheel.

The power windows have an annoying tendency to stop working when they're open, then spontaneously, usually *after a heavy rain, work again just long enough for you to trust them.  We get about 25 mpg, which isn't too awful in a 6 cylinder.
