            I recently leased an Explorer and it is great so far; handles well, smooth ride, plenty of power even in the V-6 version.  Split seats in back fold down for transporting large items and the back door can be fully opened or just partially opened at the back window; there is also a power lock button inside near the back door for convenient locking after unloading the vehicle.
If you are leasing, be careful; I would recommend a settled price before paperwork is done and a limit of at least 15,000 miles per year during the lease - and then check those items on your paperwork before signing...
Unless you know you will use 4WD, there is probably not much need for it with this vehicle.  4WD costs more and if there are repairs to be made or troubleshooting to be done, it is much harder to do with an extra drive on the vehicle.
One other thing I would like to add is that if you drive on rough gravel roads or in areas where there are lots of small 'ruts' in the road, stay alert - this vehicle does not seem to recover quickly after hitting a series of 'ruts' and may slide to the side a little; of course this may just be the way an SUV handles on such terrain, but it got my attention - has made me have to be more alert of what the road is doing in front of me.
