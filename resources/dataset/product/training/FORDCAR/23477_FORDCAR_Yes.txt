            I'm a Toyota person, but I came very close to buying the 2000 Taurus.  I know that some people who have posted here have talked about reliability problems with Ford.  But I think that was with their older models.

This car has a very handsome outside styling to it and beautiful colors to choose from.  Their power driver's seat was one of the most comfortable (especially with the adjustable pedals-2000) I have ever sat in, and I can't begin to tell you the discomfort of my Corolla driver's seat.  Also, in my never-ending new car search, the Taurus was the most quiet at freeway speeds.  The big, full center armrest adds a touch of luxury that seems to be missing from other cars in this class.  The inside just felt so solid, sturdy, plush, and of course saftey, saftety, saftey, which is Ford's whole selling premise with the 2000 Taurus. Smart.

So why didn't I buy it?  The gas mileage was a little low, 18-19 street.
And, in the end, I just became obsessed with saving money and getting an &quot;economy&quot; car, not realizing that there's no value in saving money if you are dissatisfied in the long-run.  And gas prices are not going to stay high for ever.  Me and my &quot;poverty thinking&quot;; I realize now that I should have just went with what I really wanted.  There's more to buying a car than simply trying to save money on gas.  My advice is to buy more car than you think you will need.  You'll be happier in the long run.  

I'll have a difficult time deciding between a Camry and a Taurus the next time I go looking for a car, which could be sooner rather than later.
