            I purchased my 00 Mustang Convertible nearly a year ago and
have not regretted it once.  Mine is white with black top,
charcoal leather interior, V6 sports appearance package
(side stripe, nicer rims, spoiler) and has all the standard
features (complete power package (windows, seats, locks), 
CD player, etc).  I traded a 97 Jeep Cherokee Sport (which
I was pleased with as well) for the Mustang because I wanted
something sportier and I was tired of the dreadful fuel
economy on the Jeep ( I commute a long distance every day).
I've owned a variety of foreign and domestic cars (several
Mustangs) through the years.  Immediately I was taken with
appearance of the Mustang (after the 99 over-haul) and after
receiving mine, I was impressed with the vast improvements
over my past Mustangs.

In comparing it with the other Mustangs I've owned, I found
this one to be worlds ahead in refinement and comfort.  The
V6 is more than adequate (it would have been nice to have the
V8 but not in exchange for higher cost and insurance rates!)
in moving the car with plenty of authority.  The leather seats
are extremely comfortable (even on longer trips) and the
placement of all the interior accessories are good.  I'm a
tall guy and I find that I feel comfortable while seated
which is not the case with many other cars I considered.
The convertible top is very easy to operate and only takes
seconds to drop down and you're on your way.  I've taken
the car on several extended road trips in a variety of 
terrains (mountains and deserts) and climates (hot and cold)
and it has performed excellently. 

I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone
who is looking for a fun, sporty car that's a good value
for the money.  Don't mistake it for a family car in any
way... it's best for a maximum of two people... three in
a pinch.  The interior space is adequate and trunk can
accommodate a couple of small suitcases at most.  It's
a terrific car and I look forward to driving it each day.

Congrats to Ford on the continual evolvement of the
Mustang.  It will be fun to see what the next generation
of Mustang has in store for us!        <br><br>
