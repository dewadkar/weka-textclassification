            The Ford Mustang Cobra and the Chevrolet Camaro Z-28 are so close in performance that many people are inconclusive on which to purchase.  

Both of these American made cars offer the same options - both can receive ram-air for added performance- although it's more difficult to get Ford to include Ram-Air on the Cobra.  The leather package for the Z-28 and the Cobra are almost identical - not in looks but in material.  The Z-28 offers slightly more leg room than the Cobra but all weighs a little more than the pony car.  I'd rather have the leg room.  

With these things said, I believe that you must judge these cars more on their outer shells than what's inside.  &quot;I guess you can judge a book by it's cover.&quot;  

The Cobra is a national symbol, in my opinion.  It screams I've got power and I'm not afraid to use it!  It's a MUSCLE car!  Other drivers on the road will know that your not just driving to work - you're enjoying every moment of it!  

Although the Z-28 offers the same power, I don't think that other drivers and even Police officers notice the Z-28 AS MUCH as they notice Mustangs.  Don't get me wrong - I owned a Z-28 and got my share of tickets, but when I owned my Mustang, I was pulled over for no reason at all - they just wanted to check me out I guess.  The Cobra's exhaust is a little louder and that may account for something.  

The ticket prices of these cars are again too close to use as factors.  A new Cobra runs about 25,000 and so does the Z-28.  The convertible models run close to 28 or 29 thousand.  

My opinion and suggestion to all drivers considering these two cars is to test drive both cars twice.  Tell me if you don't think the Z-28 handles a little better - but how many looks do you get in the COBRA?

Happy driving everyone!<br><br>
