            In June of 2000, I chose to purchase an automatic ZTS Ford Focus sedan.  It is a roomy compact car that gets great gas mileage.  The ZTS is equiped with almost everything, power doors, windows, z-tech engine, 2 airbags,  air conditioning, etc.  

So far I love this car.  I drove out from Oregon all the way to Ohio and did not encounter one single problem.  In fact I haven't even changed the oil since I left Oregon and it has 6,000 on it, although I well be changing it in the next week.  It was a nice ride across the country for a small car.  It handles great on long trips.  

Perhaps, if you want more power, you may consider getting the manual transmission.  Sometimes my automatic does not have a lot of get up and go to it.  It was a good purchase for the money, of course I doubt you could purchase this car under $15,000, so if you want a larger car for the money, you may want to look at a Ford Countour or Ford Tourus.  However, I am not disapointed in the least.  

The only small problem I've encountered is the inside button for to open the trunk does not always work, so I have to unlock in from the back using my key.  I have a three year warenty on the car, and even have roadside assistance.  So if anything where to happen, I can call a 1-800 number and get help.  

If you're out there looking and haven't come to a decision, give the Ford Focus some consideration.<br><br>
