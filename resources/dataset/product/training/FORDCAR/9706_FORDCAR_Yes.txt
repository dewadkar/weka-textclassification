                   My father purchased a 1997 ford Probe for me for my high school graduation. I love this car! I mainly wanted this car because other family members had Probes and found them to be reliable vehicles. Plus is was cute, sporty, and just looked great on the road. He bought me a deep metallic red Probe and it looked sharp. 
       Driving this car is so much fun! Mine is a standard and shifts really smoothly. The car takes curves very well and has excellent pickup. It really has get-up-and-go. The power is unbelievable. The only problems I have with this car is the lack of interior space. I recently had a baby and it is just not a &quot;mommy car&quot;. It's a good sports car, but not a good family car. 
       Ford Probes are reliable and will last a very long time. Everyone that I know that has them loves them. They just keep right on going. My mother and uncle have had them and both put way over 100,000 miles on their cars. Like I said before this car rides very nicely and is great to drive in-town or on long road trips.
       This car is best for couples without children or a single person. It does not have the room required and much needed for children. Overall this car is great and it is also reasonably priced. Definitely a top buy!<br><br>
