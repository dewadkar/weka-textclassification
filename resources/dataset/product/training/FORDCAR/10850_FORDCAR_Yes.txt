            We have a family of five and have been in vans since 94.  In the summer of 98 we inherited a 98 Windstar.  I quickly fell in love with it.  The windstar drives like a car.  My 3 kids prefer to travel in it than our other van.  Their comfort is important to me.  The dual AC is a wonderful accessory.  The ease of cleaning is a plus to me.  

Several of my friends who have travel in my other van swore they would never own a van....once spending time in my Windstar they are finding themselves buying one.  The Windstar handles like a car vs a truck.  The safety features are great.  We have had no work performed on our vehicle since acquiring it except your usual maintenance.<br><br>
