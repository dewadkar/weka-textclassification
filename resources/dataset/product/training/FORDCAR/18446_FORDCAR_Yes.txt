            I had a few pickup trucks, years ago, but somehow found myself driving an imported compact sedan for the past five years.  This year, I decided to trade that vehicle in and get back into a small truck.  I read countless reviews online (many right here) before making up my mind.  And the day I test drove my little Ranger XL it was love at first sight.

A "plain Jane" work truck, my Ranger reminded me of my first car- a Chevy police car- with its tough, vinyl seats and heavy duty rubber floor mats. The dash and seats looked surprisingly good for a truck with 60,000 miles and nothing rattled or squeaked.

Since I had set a price range of $6-7,000 for myself, I knew I wasn't going to get a fully-loaded XLT with CD player, extended cab and 4-wheel drive!  This truck was just what I wanted. At $6,000 from a dealer, I could get a good, solid truck and pay a few bucks for a warranty.

With the 2.3 liter engine (2 plugs per cylinder and a high-flow exhaust header from the factory!), I didn't expect much. But thanks to the hot gears (3.73) and well-tuned transmission gear range, this truck moves out pretty well- certainly better than my old Geo Prizm sedan, which supposedly had only 18 horsepower less than my truck. The 4-speed automatic works very well and the overdrive on-off feature is great.  The truck sounds good too- not loud but with a lot more personality than most 4-cylinder powered rides.

The stereo is a simple factory AM/FM but it sounds terrific- four speakers, great reception, bass, treble, fade and balance controls and 18 presets- good enough for me.

Of course a compact truck without an extended cab is not going to provide a lot of interior space for passengers and stuff. But if you are alone, or riding with one passenger, all you need is a good storage box in the bed to take care of tools and some luggage- I got a nice box for $80 and put it in myself. I am 6'1", 220 pounds and I am comfortable in this truck.

The Ranger rides very well in my opinion. I love the firm, truckish handling and so far, no one has complained that it's too bumpy.

I can't speak too much about the long term reliability since I haven't owned it that long.  But I have high hopes. I have driven and owned compact Chevy trucks and an old Dodge import truck (Ram 50) and let me tell you- they felt like rattling junk compared to the solid nature of this machine. You feel it in the ride, in the seats, even in things like the transmission shifter and wiper control knobs; everything in this truck says "truck," even though it's a compact. So far, so good.
