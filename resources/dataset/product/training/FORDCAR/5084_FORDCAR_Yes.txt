            I have owned my taurus for over two years now and I still have to say that I love it!  It is the perfect family car if you are not completely ready for a van and it is also still sporty enough for couples who don't have children.
One of my favorite parts of the car is the large trunk.  I love to be able to fit my stroller in it and anything else that I want to carry.  It had been wonderful when we took trips up north...we always feel like we have enough room.  I also think that the inside of the car is roomy and spacious...you don't feel trapped inside.
Though I love the taurus, it has had a few problems.  One of the things I don't like about it is that the warranty through Ford has not been very thorough.  We had the retractor break on the seatbelt, only after a year after it was purchased, and Ford refused to fix it...even though all the mechanics say that something like that she not break so fast.  The worst part is that it is really expensive to fix!
But overall I really do love my car.  We really feel like we got a good deal when we purchased it!<br><br>
