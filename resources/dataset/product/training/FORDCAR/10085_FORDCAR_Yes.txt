            This is my 4th Ranger since 1984.  Each has been better than the last. This Ranger replaced my 1996 Ranger supercab with the 3.0 V6.  Finally the Ranger has some power and better handling. The 96 replaced a wretched 94 4 cyl. model with zero power. The 3.0 was still too weak and noisy to pull trailers or haul a load on the highway well, and the twin I beam ride was bouncy.  The 4.0 is a vast improvement, although the extra cost was a bitter pill to take.  

The 4.0 has great ability to smoothly torque away at traffic lights with little fuss, penalty is decreased gas mileage.  

The XLT trim includes a nice level of options.  The seats are better for a long trip but there seems to be reduced headroom. (This may have happened before 2001).  The four doors add extra utility to the rear area, and things like packages and luggage are much easier to load.  People room is poor, and side facing seats are simply awful.  An adult has to crawl into the culvert-like space.  This is nothing new with the Ranger. I have noted more wind noise with this truck, but the engine noise is lower, so I'm not sure if it is relly more than old truck.

Spring rate is stiffer and truck sits higher than older models. Around town ride is stiff, but highway manners are good.  As previously mentioned hauling is better.  I recently rented a 2000 model 3.0 V6, and the 2001 is markedly better on the Interstate.

Plastic bed-rail caps are silly, but real load ties have been added in the bed.  Hopefully in the new re-design some of the size failings will improve.  However a lot of us buy this because we don't want the size of the F150.  The 2001 Ranger is fun to drive.  The power options and CD player is another step to a nicer vehicle.  But the price is climbing too.
As usual with the Ranger no squeaks or rattles. 

Should one wait for the next generation?  Possibly.  For me, even at 32K miles I had had enough of my 1996 model.  There is always something better on the horizon.
