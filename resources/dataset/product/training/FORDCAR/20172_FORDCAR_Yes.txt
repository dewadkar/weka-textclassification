            I earn a Ford Winstar on March 2000. I goes to Dodge/Chrysler and GM dealers for a test drive of the Caravan/Town and Country and the Venture/Transport but I choose the Winstar by Ford. The first impression count. The Daimler and the GM don't impress me so much... I tryed them and that confirm my first impression... there's are a second class mini-van. Not enought power, comfort, style, class... only the Town and Country and the Montana that I can consider that is a correct van for Americans models. For others, forget Toyota. Mazda produce a great mini-van and it's a new concept in the windows of the side doors. Honda has a great van too but I still prefer the Winstar. The winstar has some point that's positive like the security that got 4 times a five star security grade, comfort (Could live in seats!), the look very ameliorated since last years, the Prestige of the SEL model, the 200 bhp V6 engine and a perfect handling. I can tell a cons for the Winstar, theirs sliding doors are a little bit slow. If theirs open faster it can be more attractive than it is now. Everyone can buy a Winstar cause it can be abordable (LX) and a little bit costly but extremely attractive (Limited). Don't buy this beautiful machine if you think that's a sport car. It's performances are excellent (not like the Dodge! theirs performances are very very bad) for a mini-van. My final note on 10 is : 9.8 .
