            My 1989 Ford Probe has been very reliable for me. I have owned  it for almost three years now and have had only minor problems with it. I originally wanted one of these when a neighbor moved next door the same year Probe that I have. I immediately liked it and wanted one. These cars ride very smoothly and do not have many problems with them. I really do not hate anything about this vehicle. It corners and makes sharp turns very easy. I think that this car is not meant for everyone but if you like the sporty kind of car, get one. This is a very nice car to have.<br><br>
