            The Ford  Escort gives you the look of a sports car without the cost of a sports car�Perfect for a diverse group of drivers.  Price seems to always be an important factor when looking for cars but this auto falls close to the bottom in automobiles made my Ford�but still with Ford quality.  After about eight months of continuous driving, and well, about the 10,000 mile mark, I have not encountered any problems or signs of problems with this car.  It has been driven down to San Diego from LA  almost every weekend for the past four months, and even took a trip up north to San Francisco�and amazingly for such a small car, we had a very comfortable ride.  

The interior layout provides the most for the space contributing to such comfort.  Even the back is comfortable and can fit three people�although you may not want to drive on long trips with three in the back.  Your passengers may not be too comfortable after a while, and there is no middle seat belt.  This makes it great for singles, couples or college students in transporting some family or friends (but probably isn�t the best car for a family of more than three or four).  Plus, it�s small, so in a town like LA, parallel parking is a little easier to find.  The Escort is a fairly quick car but does not have the power of say a Mustang, which makes this car great as a first car or for first time drivers.  Once again, you have the looks of a sports car but you don�t have to worry about hot rodding with this vehicle.  

The gas mileage is descent, although interestingly the dealer said to use only regular gas with this car�I�m not sure what the reasoning is behind this, but with how high gas prices were getting, it kept the cost of gas to a minimal.
