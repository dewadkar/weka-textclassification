             I bought this vehicle on the advice of a well informed friend, even though I was a little fearful of it because I knew that Ford was not the principle builder of it and i did not know much about the company who was. He assured me that the power train was actually built by Mazda and it would run as long as and as well as a Mazda 323. I later found out that he was indeed telling the truth because although it already had about 80,000 mi. on it I was still able to drive it 1,500 mi. a week for over 7 months and still have it running well when I traded it in.       The only complaint I had about it was that it was a little hard to steer from a stopped position.                                                  If indeed you are looking for a little reliable, economical automobile then this is one that I definintly would recommend!<br><br>
