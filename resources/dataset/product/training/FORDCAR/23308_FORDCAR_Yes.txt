            After wreaking the other car we decided on a mid-sized car. Well we have had it for about 3 weeks and are really enjoying it. It seats 6 comfortably (3 in the front and 3 in the back) it has auto windows (with
a window lock),power door locks,lots of foot space in the front and back and power steering. I am really enjoying
the power steering, it turns corners so easy and smoothly.The comfort level in the car is great.And talk about trunk space! The trunk is huge.
(You could probably fit a small calf in it!)I highly reccomend this car.<br><br>
