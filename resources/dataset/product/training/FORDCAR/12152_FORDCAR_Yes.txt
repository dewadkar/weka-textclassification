            The F-250 should make anyone a nice vehicle to own.  We own our crew cab for business and pleasure.  It is more room for the passengers and everyone should ride in comfort.  I have drove the gasoline and the diesel engines.  The diesel has the power to pull all kinds of trailers.  The gas mileage is comparable to other large vehicles and is easy to find diesel in any town. The gasoline is a faster vehicle from the start and the gas mileage is about the same.  The back doors are nice for the passengers and front seat passengers, the ease of getting in without the front doors being opened.  The interior is great and the comfort is outstanding.  The dash is easy to read and to see.  It is a good idea to have tilt and cruise if it will be a highway truck.  The 2 gasoline tanks are convenient to have and you can travel further.  The bed is nice to have with or without a canopy.  The ride is smoother with highway tires if you don't plan to go off road, I would recommend the highway tires!<br><br>
