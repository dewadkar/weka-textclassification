            I have owned my Supercab F150 for almost 4 years now.  It is a solid vehicle that is worth the money that I paid for it.  I pull a boat pretty regularly and the 4.6l V-8 can more than handle the load even with a bed full of fishing and camping gear.  The new suspension in the new pickup body gives the truck almost a car like ride.  It can be a fooler sometimes.  You think you can take corners like a sports car and it will roll out a little.  I have found the ride more stable with about 500# of gear in the back.  In the winter, you are better off with a couple hundred pounds of sand over the back axle.  

The interior is nice.  I have the Lariet finish with the leather seats.  The dash is intuitive with the instrument layout.  The heat is good.  The air conditioner needs a separate on/off button though.  Sometimes it is hard to tell when the air if on or not.  The center console is convenient for storage.  The back seat is adequate and comfortable for short trips.  I wouldn't recommend 4 big guys making a 700 mile trip in it though....wonder where I found that one out?   The back seats flip down and reveal a cargo platform, which is nice dry safe storage for things that are not clean enough to put on the seats. <br><br>
