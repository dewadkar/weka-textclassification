            Hmm, this is my first post so I will address the suggested points...
Why did I buy the Probe? Well, I was in the market for a quick 2 door with a manual trans (used) without spending a lot of cash or getting something that would clear my back accounts because of insurance or gas (that took care of the Eclipse/3kGT/Mustang). Anyway, I saw the probe for sale for a very low price and figured that it had potential. The next day it was in my driveway. :-)
What do I love and hate? Love the looks, handling, and feel of the car. The gas milage is nice too. :-) Hate? What's to hate? Except the fact that it is a little slower than I would like but that is being taken care of. :-) Love and hate the fact that aftermarket parts are hard to come by. Love it cause I am one of few, hate it cause it can be hard to get stuff...
What is it like to drive? Simple. Nearly orgasmic! :-)
Who should buy it? Anybody who wants a sweet looking car that does great in the market of performance vs. fuel economy. 
Who should not buy it? Large family? Don't get a Probe...
