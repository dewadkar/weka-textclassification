            I owned one car, a 1988 Isuzu I-Mark, while my husband went through four in the same period of time.  He just seems to have no luck in picking out a used car.

So when the time came that we were going to buy a very new (for us) used car, it was my job to research it.  We came away with either the <b>Ford Windstar</b> or <b>Nissan Quest</b>.  We were supposed to go looking for our van together, but I bought our <b>1996 Ford Windstar</b> when I saw it on Saturn's used-car lot.

At the time, it was 3 years old and on a lease-return.  It only had 28,000 miles on it.  When I opened up the hood to look at the engine, it was so clean you could eat off of it.  And Saturn hadn't yet prepped it for sale.  I saw it before it was really on the market yet.

We paid $13,995 for it 3 years used.  Easily, this is the best vehicle we've had.

<b>THE SPECS</b>

Our <b>Windstar</b> came with the 3.8 liter 6-cylinder engine.  This meant it is rated for towing up to 3500 pounds.  That sounds like a lot, but last year we were looking into purchasing a pop-up camper, and by the time you added in the weight of gear, people, food, and the camper we would be well over on all but the most stripped-down of campers.  So don't count on using the <b>Windstar</b> for towing anything.

The 4-speed automatic transmission would also present a problem towing on any sort of inclined surface, even with the automatic overdrive feature.  A transmission cooler was suggested for towing as well, so this was one of the reasons we decided to go with tent camping instead of a pop-up.

However, under normal conditions, this van has performed extremely well.  We've taken it to Florida twice and have had no problems with acceleration on the highway.  Gas mileage is decent for a van.  It's rated at 17 mpg for the city and 23 mpg for the highway.  I either get a lot more for the highway or a lot less for the city because I see a <i>very</i> big difference in my gas mileage between the two.

The van is equipped with power steering and power brakes.  I don't know of many vehicles anymore that don't come equipped with these features.  The van has always responded well with steering.  The cruise control feature works well, but is in an awkward place on the steering wheel.  When I'm driving at night, I find it hard to figure out which buttons mean what if I'm trying to use the cruise control.


<b>SAFETY</b>

The <b>Windstar</b> is a front-wheel drive vehicle.  Here in the northeast, that is especially important during the fall and winter when the roads have a tendency to be slick.

It is also equipped with anti-lock brakes which not only give us an insurance discount, but also prevent the <b>Windstar</b> from locking it's wheels and skidding.

There are dual airbags so both the driver and passenger in the front seat are protected in the event of a crash.  I sure hope they work, but I also hope I never have to find out if they work well :-)

The bumpers on the <b>Windstar</b> are rated for withstanding 5 mph crashes without any damage.  Again, I haven't had to try this out myself.  Someone apparently tapped me in the parking lot, but I think it was an SUV that went above the bumpers because it left a slight dent in my rear door.

<b>COMFORT FACTORS</b>

The <b>Windstar</b> comes equipped with two cloth-covered captain's chairs in the front, two more in the middle, and a rear bench seat.  The captain's chairs in the middle really help for avoiding those "She's touching me!" moments.  All of the chairs recline and adjust.

There are lights and mirrors in each of the front visors.  In fact, there are lights all over this van.  The passengers in the back can also put on the lights.  This is great for my oldest daughter every time we travel at night and she wants to find her Gameboy or a snack. 

There is an AM/FM Cassette Stereo and Digital Clock in the dash.  We've added a CD Changer that fits in the console between the two seats in the front.  The sound is decent, nothing exceptional.

It's nice that the passenger behind the driver has a set of controls for the radio, as well as the heat and air-conditioning.  There are also headphone jacks so if the driver wants quiet, they can plug in to listen.

One thing we found to be really important are the foldaway power mirrors.  I was waiting to make a left turn and I was almost broadsided by a truck. He did knock into my mirror and shattered the glass without breaking the casing.  Ford has made it so you can just replace the glass and not the whole casing.  What could've been a $600 part ended up being only $60.

The spare tire is located underneath the van, which is both good and bad.  It's good since I don't have to worry about packing around it every time we bring home a load of groceries from the warehouse club.  It's bad because I don't know if I would be able to get it out of there myself if we ever did have a flat tire.

This van is everything my family could want.  It carries a lot, both inside the van and on the roof with a carrier.  hen we have that full load of groceries, the rear seat folds down and slides forward, creating quite a bit of room for packing.  When our family grew by one in June of 2000, we didn't have to worry about how we were going to get around, where we would put him, or how we would travel on vacations.

So far we have only had to replace the tires, the oxygen sensors, the fuel lines, the battery, and the shocks and struts.  I consider that normal maintenance for a five year-old vehicle.  We plan to keep it another five years since we still have less than 60,000 miles on it.
