              After 6 months with this truck I have become totally dependant upon its many practical uses. It hauls tons of stuff, it trailers nicely, it even carries more than 3 people at the same time. It may not be the most perfect truck, but it delivers time and time again.

  There are several issues to consider when looking at trucks like this. First, what do intend on using it for? Hauling alot of cargo? Towing a trailer? Taking the entire family to the mall? Well, this is the best compromise available. I looked at the crew cab (4 full size doors) and it limited my bed size more than I wanted. I looked at the smaller Toyota full size and didn't like the interior space limitations. I looked at the Dodge and Chevy and felt they were lower in quality. 

  I would say this truck fits the person who wants to have the ability to haul a pile of construction materials from Home Depot to home, but also wants more space in the cab for stuff, a dog, or a few more people. It may not be very comfortable with more people inside, but for short rides it isn't too bad. 

  The quality of the fit and finish is excellent. Almost as good as the Japanese cars I own. The overall mechanical reliability seems to be excellent too. I have over 15K miles without a single problem. Something I could never say of the prior trucks I have owned.

  The biggest drawback must be the gas mileage. With the price of gas leaning towards the $2/gal range, this can be a very expensive vehicle to drive. 

  In conclusion, if you are dreaming of the 8 foot bed, and full size 4 door cab, but it is too expensive, doesn't exist, or wont fit in your garage, this is an excellent compromise. It gives you more room than the crew cabs in the bed, and more room in the cab than the standard cab trucks.
