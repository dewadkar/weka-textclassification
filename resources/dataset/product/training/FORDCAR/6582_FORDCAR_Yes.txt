            ** Jan 2002 update** 

Three years and 40,000 miles so far and my F-150 is still going strong.

I did have a problem with the sheetmetal on the front drivers side door cracking near the lower, rearmost corner f the window.  Ford installed a repair kit, repaired and repainted both doors free of charge.

I've replaced the original front brake pads with a set from Raybestos at about 28,000 miles.  They only lasted 10,000 miles.  The current brake pads are a cheap set from NAPA.  I'll let you know how they wear.

Milage with the 4.6L motor remains 16-20mpg (city/highway) and about 12-13mpg when towing our racecar(s).  I've use Mobil 1 oil since the first oil change.

Besides those minor issue I'm still very, very happy with my truck. 

** original review **

I've had my F150 for just about one year and almost 20,000 miles now.  To date I've been quite pleased.  My truck is a F150XLT with the 4.6l V8, 2wd, extended cab, towing package, cast alloy wheels (and bigger tires), and the premium CD player.

I've only had one minor problem to date with windshield wipers that take a swipe or two for no apparent reason (they're turned off).  This happens about once a month.  It's been so minor that I've yet to take the truck back in for it to be fixed. Everything else about this truck has been good to exceptional.  

The comfort level is quite high, comparable or better than many cars I've been in, surprising for a truck.  I've been on several 6 hours runs  without feeling the need to stop and take a break.  The back seats in the extended cab are roomy enough for adults to take a 100 mile trip without complaint, I wouldn't want to be back there for 6 hours though.

Performance of the 4.6l V8 is acceptable.  We use the truck to tow racecars on weekends and find it more than willing to haul 6000lbs of trailer, car(s) and gear up any hill here in the northeast.  In hindsight the 5.9l engine may have been a better choice for towing but this is a daily driver so the better economy of the smaller engine was a good fit for my needs.  Fuel economy is in the 12-16mpg range, 12 when towing, 16 in a normal mix of city and highway driving.  Not up to par with my Honda CRX Si but it is a truck after all.  People don't buy these things to save gas, they're for hauling "stuff".  Be warned though, it's a nice truck and it'll tempt you to make it your daily driver, the gas bills will add up quick!

Handling was a big surprise for me.  This drives much better than I ever imagined any full size truck could.  Ford has done a great job.  There's great road feel through the controls and body roll is reasonable.  I imagine the Lightning versions must be a BLAST to drive!

If you want a high quality, comfortable vehicle and have a need to haul things the Ford F150 is worth a look.
