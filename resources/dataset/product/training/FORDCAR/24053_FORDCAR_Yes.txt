            Just recently my fiance and I bought a 1997 Ford Expedition. We love it! It has so much room.  It is great for road trips. You will never have to worry about your knees getting smashed or elbows being bumped again. We have a 7 month old daughter, and we can log all of her stuff around with us. It is dependable. We haven't had any problems with it. Anyone with a family should own one of these. It makes going anywhere just that much easier.  I know that they are costly, but it is worth it. I know that a lot of people don't have high expectations of FORDS ( my fiance USED to be on of them) but this vehicle could change your mind. It handles very well in all weather conditions. So you won't be afraid to go out in bad weather. My overall view of this vehicle is excellent!<br><br>
