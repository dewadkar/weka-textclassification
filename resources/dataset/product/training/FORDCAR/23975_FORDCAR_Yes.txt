            This is a big van - it carries 15 passengers comfortably.  We have a large family so this was the vehicle for us.  We got the 15 passenger so we could remove the last seat and have lots of cargo space when we need it. 

I love that it's big and powerful - it's got a V-10 so it can get up and go and doesn't get sluggish on hills.  It's up high so I can see everything and I feel completely safe in it. I don't like that the back windows don't open - it gets stuffy and hot in the back at times and the vent needs to be turned on.  The speaker covers and ash trays break easily which is bad for a vehicle meant to carry many people. 

It's really easy to drive - I was intimidated by it at first, but it's really like driving a car - I feel completely at ease with it - even backing up is a breeze!  It's got lots of power and when you put your foot into it, it moves!

This is a good van for someone with a large family who has outgrown their mini van - it offers more room and more security.  <br><br>
