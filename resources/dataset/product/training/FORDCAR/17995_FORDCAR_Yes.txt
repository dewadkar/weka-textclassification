            My husband and I decided to purchase our Ford Explorer for several reasons. The first reason was that we wanted a vehicle that was similar to driving a truck. The second reason was because we wanted a vehicle that we could &quot;store&quot; our packages and cargo in without having to move it from the bed of a pickup truck to the front seating area.

We looked at both the 2 door and the 4 door model to determine which would work better for our family. We had to rule out the 2 door because it was not big enough for our growing family. (We have 3 children ages 7, 11 and 15). Therefore, we decided to look more closely at the 4 door models.

After test driving the Explorer we we're very impressed by it's handling and how roomy it is inside. We have taken several trips and have been impressed by it's reliability and gas usage.

The back seat is comfortable and roomy enough for a child or an adult to sit.

I recommend this vehicle for anyone with young children. I do not recommend this vehicle for &quot;tall&quot; or long legged people.<br><br>
