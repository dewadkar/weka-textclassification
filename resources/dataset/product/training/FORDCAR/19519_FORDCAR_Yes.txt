I've recently been doing a lot of shopping around for a sports car and frankly was disappointed with what I found.  Until a friend mentioned a Saleen. For those of you who don't know or haven't heard about a Saleen please let me indulge you.  Steve Saleen started his company in '83. He was looking to make a great American muscle car even better.  Since his beginnings Steve Saleen has made thousands of affordable and competitive race cars.  His success is based on a simple formula. Produce an extremely fast car that is affordable and looks great.
     
Today, Steve Saleen has accomplished in provided the poor man's Ferrari.  For '01, Saleen takes a Mustang GT and fixes many of the complaints that I have noticed on other epinions.  First, the body gets a total outer working with the aerodynamics.  This gives the Mustang a sharper/meaner look. Secondly, the mustang is lowered to get ride of the "4x4 look". This does give the car a slightly stiffer ride, but the trade of is well worth it. a complete suspension workover is done along with improved pulley system. 
    
 Now on to the engine.  The life blood of any sports car.  Saleen takes the GT's engine and with the help of a supercharger (optional) boosts power to 365hp. It can do the 1/2 mile in 3.4 sec at 106mph. These are great times for a mustang it even beats out the Corvette. It came in at 13.5 sec at 107mph.*According to Motor Trend* 
     
Pricing for a Saleen is suprisingly low. $32,000 for the base model and $43,000 with everything.  The price is worth it.  Not only does the Saleen look great and perform well, but the price is very low for a car of its caliber. The resale value is also very high.
    
 Saleen takes a good sports car and makes it great. I only wish this was the way that Ford would produce the mustang in the first place.
