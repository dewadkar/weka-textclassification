            Good Points:

I bought my 99 Ford Ranger last year with 13K miles. Around 17K miles I was involved in an accident. I was very impressed on how well the truck withstood the damage. I hit a full size truck in front of me and I was able to rip his bumper off crunching his bed into his rear tire leaving this vehicle not drivable. A car also hit me in the back crumpling the bed on the left side. This car was also not drivable. I was able to drive my truck to the repair shop. I found out later that both engine mounts were broke along with the transmission mount. The bed was replaced, both airbags were replaced and the front end was repaired. There was no frame damage and ford gave me a lifetime warranty on all parts. Total cost of the bill was around 7K. My insurance picked up all but 500 dollars. I currently have 35K miles and I still love this truck. If you want to buy a safe truck I would highly recommend this vehicle. As they say at the Ford house these things are made Ford tough.

Bad Points:

The only problem I have with this vehicle is the fuel economy. I have the 3 liter six making 150HP. I can only get 19 miles a gallon. This is also including highway miles. 80 % of my 21-mile trip is highway. I also use super unleaded. Other people have told me that all Ford products have poor fuel economy. I have learned to accept this shortcoming and I would still recommend this vehicle to anyone.
