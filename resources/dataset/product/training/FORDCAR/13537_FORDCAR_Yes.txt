            Although i am young and have not driven many cars, i have come to realize that my ford explorer is the best truck on the road.  The power capabilities of this truck are excellent. although it is sometimes a little poor in hard rain, in all other conditions this truck handles extremely well.  in snow it shines, the auto 4 wheel drive keeps you in complete control no matter how sloppy the conditions.  Even the xlt which is the lowest model has many luxurious features.  The package I got has leather seats, power everything, in-dash CD/cassette, remote entry, and a rear defrost and wiper.  for a small family or a person seeking power and style, the ford explorer is the way to go.<br><br>
