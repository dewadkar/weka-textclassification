            I love mustangs. Of course I was brought up in a ford loving family, but that really doesnt matter. Well, I bought this vehicle because of its sleek new look and its well-known name, well besides being a ford lover.
There isn't to much you could hate about this vehicle. I mean, it looks good, it handles good, and it is decently quick. Oh yeah, you can also roast the tires right off of it's rims, not a bad accessory in my opinnion. It's only down fall for the GT, is that it doesn't have the power you would expect from Mustang. But all-in-all it is a great car for a small family, gas mileage isn't bad, and it has great pickup on the highway if you live in a large city. I think that anybody would enjoy themselves in one of these great vehicles, whether or not it is a six cylinder or a V-8.<br><br>
