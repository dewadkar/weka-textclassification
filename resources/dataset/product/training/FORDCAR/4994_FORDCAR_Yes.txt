            Would you like a truck that can take a beating?
Would you like a truck that you can &quot;play in the mud with&quot;, and not have to worry about getting stuck?
Would you like a truck that is more comfortable and quieter than a 2000 Chevrolet Z71, comparably equipped?
Would you like a truck that can actually &quot;get up and go&quot;?
How about a truck that is easy to load up, and/or get in and out of?

Well... you may want to seriously consider a Ford 5.4 liter F-150 XLT Flareside Supercab... did I mention these come standard with those 2 nifty little &quot;extended cab doors&quot;??  These are great for toolboxes, lunch boxes, co-workers, and so on.

Granted, I'm still not terribly thrilled about the new &quot;body design&quot; Ford decided to drop on us in 1997... However, the comfortable and convenient layout of the interior makes up for this.  
I am aware of the &quot;interior goofs&quot; that the 1997-99 F-150's had.  I have been informed these &quot;goofs&quot; were taken care of before the 2000 &quot;rolled out&quot;.  I have not seen any of these &quot;goofs&quot; in my 2000 to date.

This truck is SOLID!  I never thought going down a beat up &quot;industrial district&quot; road could actually be so much fun!
It's TOUGH, too - got bumped in the rear by a 10 wheel delivery truck on a rainy morning... This delivery truck probably hit me between 5-10mph (sliding).  I brushed his license plate paint off of my bumper, took his insurance info, and had my truck looked at.  Got it lifted in the air, and not a dent, scratch, buckle, or any other sign I had just been bumped!

Did I mention that the national crash test results for this truck came back as &quot;Excellent&quot;?

If you are wondering &quot;How does this compare to the 2000 Chevy Z71?&quot;, do what I did - compare the two with a test drive.  I rented a 2000 Z71 for 3 days before I purchased my F-150.  The only good thing I can say about the Z71 was the 6.0 liter was plenty powerful.... It was hard to notice this though, because I was either uncomfortable in Chevy's &quot;newly designed interior&quot;, fiddling with Chevy's version of &quot;Push Button 4 wheel drive&quot; (painfully irritating - it took me shifting in park, reversing, and going back in drive up to 4 times 'once' to get the &quot;4 wheel low&quot; unlocked!), or trancefully gazing at their gawdy &quot;COMMAND CENTER&quot; in the middle of the dash...  
I have to say - the 2000 Z71 can do some &quot;really interesting donuts&quot; in the middle of a field in 4 wheel high...
My Ford can, too.  
Of course, I can easily switch back to 2 &quot;wheel drive&quot; with a turn of the &quot;dial&quot; in my Ford.  It's that easy.  I don't even have to stop.  I just turn the dial from &quot;4 wheel high&quot;, to &quot;2 wheel&quot; before I hit 60mph.  I don't have to fiddle with the &quot;push button&quot; fiasco like I did with the Chevy...  
Now, I'm sure a Chevy owner will eventually ask me &quot;What about the 'Automatic 4 wheel drive' button&quot;??  
Well...are we really sure this is such a great idea??  Ever try to pull a trailer with &quot;Auto 4 wheel drive&quot;? How about those lovely &quot;almost totally wet&quot; days when having 4 wheel drive is really nice??  I tried both in the 2000 Z71.  Two more disappointments... Oh yes - where's the &quot;4th door&quot; on the Z71's??  I have to &quot;special order it&quot;??  It's not &quot;standard&quot;??  Hmmm... Make that three more disappointments from GM.

I decided on the Ford after only having rented a 4x4 F-150 for ONE day...  I tried to give Chevy a chance... GM failed me.  It looks like Ford may have &quot;their act together&quot; with this 2000 F-150 4x4.

I've had this F-150 for 5 months now - no major complaints come to mind at this time.

P.S.  If you are concerned about the smaller size of the engine - 5.4 vs. 6.0 liter, or if you want some &quot;added&quot; power from your 2000 F-150 5.4, chop the exhaust after the catalytic converters back (cat back system) - yes, the new 2000's actually have TWO converters now (another plus) -- and put a &quot;true dual&quot; exhaust system on (like &quot;Flowmaster&quot;, or my choice -- Flo-Pro,for those who would like a little quieter ride on the freeway at cruising speed).  I've literally gained AT LEAST 20% doing this, and adding a K&amp;N air filter.  I was truly amazed!   This is the only &quot;modification&quot; I've done with my F-150 so far.<br><br>
