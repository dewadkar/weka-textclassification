            The 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 is an excellent choice for someone looking for a well made affordable and fun car. Forget the KIA, change from the normal Civic, VW Golf/Jetta are too expensive now, Daewoo is nice but it just takes too long to explain (the gas mileage is less than stellar) and Toyota's Echo is just not sporty enough. The ZX3 combines the best of what the 2.0 and 1.8 liter 16 valve VW Gti used to be, adds the zip of the rare Mazda 323 GTX and puts in in a package that allows you to hear yourself think at highway speeds. The 103 inch wheelbase and redesigned rear suspension eliminate fatigue of small car jouncing over rough roads. The styling brings Mercedes owners over to ask about your new rig. The slammed Civic crowd gives you a thumb up...or a different digit displayed at the next stop light. The low maintenance (100K interval) 2.0 Ztec is smooth up to the 130 hp limit, in fact Ford doesn't even bother to put a red line on the tach...it is just bullet proof. The Engine has been proven in the Contour/Mystique and the previous ZX2. The 5 speed gearbox (MTX75)is the same durable unit put into service in Ford's SVT Contour. The ride quality and noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) is the best of any small car I have stuffed my buns into. The seats are supportive (8 hour drive the first day of ownership) and no fatigue was found in the back or rump.

The only downfall is the non-foldable door mounted mirrors and the reach for the seat belt harness mounted on the B-pillars. Fit and finish is better than my parents Grand Marquis or their new Altima.  I was leary whether Ford could pull this off and I am proud to say they did!

I race a 1987 VW Golf GTi 16V in Club Rally. The purpose of my Focus purchase is twofold. To have a car (other than my Suburban) that 2,000 miles a month won't tear out my wallet at each fill (initial 32mpg), that is fun to drive,and easy to look at. The other facet here is I wanted a car with a great platform to build a new rally car from 3 years down the road. I got both! (I win)

The buyers for this car are many. The mid thirty to mid fifty crowd who want a secondary car to drive for fun. The retired couple that sold their Bug eye Sprite to mortgage a new motorhome but still want a fun tow car. The young crowd looking for affordability, style to match eyebrow rings and a Q factor to fit in with their trust-fund friends.

I payed 12,650 (300 over dealer invoice) got the exact car I wanted including color (ext./int.) and have the 24 hour roadside assistance free at over 580 dealers around the country. If you can beat that with any other car available in America, let me know. Until then, wave hello when you see me sipping around in my Cloud 9 white ZX3!<br><br>
