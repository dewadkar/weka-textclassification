            In the year 2000 I finally had to get rid of my 1986 F-150 4X4. I bought a 1993 Ford Ranger Splash from a private owner. I was lucky enough to find the 4-wheel drive version with the 3.0 liter V6. It also had air conditioning and a 5-speed manual transmission. I bought the truck with 48,000 miles on it and the poor thing is now up to 98,000. I have done things to this truck that just aren't right to do to a truck this size. I have hauled pine logs piled up higher then the cab with the suspention bottomed out, drove right out of the woods with them in 4-wheel drive, shifted out of 4-wheel drive (push button) and drove them 15 miles to a freinds house. I have yanked bushes out of the ground with enough force to jerk the rear end up off the ground. In general I am not a gentle driver. My favorite thing in the world is to drive fast on winding roads. THE TRUCK OWES ME NOTHING! I do have to say that with the abuse I give a vehicle, I am fanaticle about maintenence and upkeep. I change the oil and filters regularly (probably way more often then I need to). The only repairs that I have had to make to the vehicle have been to replace the driver side camber cam and front end alignment (I slid into a curb in the snow) and some minor body work from being hit by another vehicle. The truck still runs today like it did the day I bought it. If my next vehicle is not a Ranger, it will be because I bought an F-150. (I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and weigh 300 lbs.) More room would be nice....... Jeff H
