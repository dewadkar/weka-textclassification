            I have always though of Ford as a crappy, non reliable company but ther Ford Explorer seems to always be good. What do they do different?

I have no Idea. I love this car though. It drives great and it could very well be the top truck in the country, atleast in my eyes it could be. I recommend this truck to everyone and it is a pretty good price also. It drives great on rough terrain. I go out to cape Cod and bring this truck through the beach and it drives great through there. I am telling you, this car is awesome, if you are smart you will listen to me.

You may think like me and say, &quot; Ford is a crappy company Im not buying form them&quot;, but this is one hell opf a truck, and I suggest you get it.
