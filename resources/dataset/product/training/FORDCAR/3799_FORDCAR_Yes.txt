            I just bought this 2003 Ford Ranger Extra Cab 4x4 xlt(Regional Package).  As you can see from my other reviews, Im a repeat buyer.  See my review on my 2001 Ford Ranger XC 4x4 Stepside.  They truck has not changed much between then and now.  I will tell you what has changed.  See more details from my 2001 review.

I lease these trucks.  One reason is the price and lease amount is one of the lowest lease payments for what you get.  My 2001 lease was 259 a month, no money down! That truck was loaded.  This time, I went with less frills to lower my payment. It is 211 a month, no money down!  Both were 36 month leases but Ford will get you out at about the 28th month mark if you buy or lease a new vehicle.  Thats a nice option.

My 2003 was a regional package that was not found in many dealers and was designed for the Northeast.  It was equiped with a 4.0L v6 engine, 16" Alloys, Off rd, tow hooks, 4.10 rear.  This truck came with the best simple options I wanted. 

This time I went with the 4.0l engine.  What a relief.  This truck can fly.  The 207 horsepower and the weight of the truck, makes this thing move. Shifts nicely, unlike the 3.0L in the last truck.  Very capable of pulling most mid size trailers.  The engine is quite and very responsive.  Im a little surprised at 75mph its tach-ing at 3000 rpms almost. Im assuming this is for towing reasons.  The 4.0L makes off roading fun.  

This time I went with the styleside.  The stepside on my 2001 really was a pain. For space and getting mulch, etc -- it was not fun.  I liked the look but the styleside is so much better. 

New for 2003 was a sportier seat design and instrument panel.  New rim design.  Thats It.  The 2004 will get a face lift and have a grill like the explorer sport or the new 2004 f150. The rest will be the same.

The Price is right, as said before.  I could have bought this for 16k. Thats cheap for a 4x4, xc with options like auto, ac.  Unfortunately, Ford depreciates quickly.  A reason why I lease. Plus I like a new truck every 2-3 yrs. 

I still wish they rolled out a full 4 door version like they make in europe.  I dont get what Ford is waiting for.  The Explorer Trac does have the same appeal or price.

The truck is sound and looks great.  Can handle most anything you throw at it except seating more than 2 people.

Worth the money!
