            The first time I saw the Silver 1998 Ford Mustang, I new I <b>HAD</b> to have it.  Needless to say, I drove it home that day. I bought the vehicle, because it had the sporty appearance that I was looking for and it really was not that expensive (compared to a lot of other sports cars).  

What I love about this car, aside from its looks, is the fact that the power is there when you need it.  It gets really good gas mileage and of course, my kids love the fact that there is a horse on the steering wheel.  

The only downfall is that the back seat is not very roomy.  Right now my kids are small and there is plenty of room for them, but I cannot see an adult being too comfortable sitting in the back seat.  The car handles really well and is easy to maneuver in and out of traffic.  I recommend this car to anyone in the market for a car with a sporty look at a decent price.  By the way, the electric adjustment on the drive's seat is a must.  <br><br>
