            We bought our Eddie Bauer Ford Bronco in 1994, its the second one we've owned our first was a 1991. I didn't think that I wanted such a big truck, in fact when we went to buy our vehicle I wanted a Jeep Cherokee. My husband suggested that I test drive a Bronco first. He was right! I loved it and told him I wasn't even interested in checking out the Jeeps! It took no time to get used to driving and it is a very comfortable ride.We did  put bigger tires on our Bronco, because we think it's safer than the smaller ones that come on it. I've heard that SUV's are notorious for turning over but I have never, ever even come close to losing control or the balance of the Bronco.<br><br>
