            I don't buy vehicles very often.  The last new one I bought was a 1981 Bronco, which I drove for nearly twelve years, through mud and snow, on the highway, in town and out.  The brakes weren't great, and the engine seals leaked oil, but those could be fixed.  The rust that ate the tailgate, the quarter panels, the hood and the fenders, was more of a problem.  Then I bought a used 89 Bronco.  It was fancier, had some extra &quot;convenience&quot; items, and burned more gas.  It also rusted, just as bad as the 81, perhaps worse, as it was only 10 years old when I got rid of it.  But both Broncos hauled stuff big time.  I could take a Boy Scout troop camping, with their gear.  I towed a 21 foot boat a thousand miles in the winter, and felt in control every foot of the way.   Great vehicles, too bad Ford thought they had to do something different.  I bought a new 2000 Explorer Sport, and after a month, I miss the Bronco more and more.  Nothing has gone wrong, but the Explorer is not a truck.  The cargo space looks tiny to me, I bang my knees on the steering wheel, my hand won't fit between the seat and the door, there isn't any room in the console for much beyond CDs.  There is lots of power, the mileage is better, and there are a lot more toys such as power mirrors and a compass to play with, but the bumpers are plastic, the auto 4WD thumps if you do a U-turn in the street, and I have the feeling this little bag of tricks is going to cost a lot of dollars if it is to survive ten years.  I miss my Bronco!
