            When I went looking for a new car I search far and wide using the net and in person. I wanted as you the best car for the money while not hurting the environment. this car does it all and then some. Some of the things i love about this car is the seats they are form fitting and the drivers seat goes up and down to fit all types of drivers and i am 6,6 with tonnes of room. the dash is set up perfectly with all knobs pointed towards the driver in very easy reach. the back seats are very roomy as well for every the long trips. the sound system that came with my wagon model was even better than the bought one I took out of my old car.To drive this car is a dream to the body and the pocketbook. this car comes with a 13 gallon tank that goes very far. I get about 37 miles to the gallon and i have been watching my trip meter and resetting it every time i fill up. the car handles like a sports car very smooth and fast pickup with very secure braking.this car is perfect for a second or starting family car or couples.     <br><br>
