                When it was time to put our old 88 Ranger to rest we began tocar shop. We are a Ford family so that is where we went. I likes the Focus a lot but it was a little to pricy for us. Then the dealer mentioned that he had some 1999 Escorts left that needed to be sold and they were marked down considerably. So we looked at them. I immediatly fell in love with the silver one. It had it all!
    When we test drove it it was like driving on air. it was great. better than anythign I had ever driven before. Of course this was the first new car I had driven. But I was in love I had to have it.  
    So I have this great new little car and I am driving it and am blissfully happy. the only small complaint I have is I wish the back seat was a tiny bit roomier. We have to put a car seat back there so sometimes it is a tight squeeze. So not a big complaint right? I dont think so. It is a very affordable car. It is good on gas. It drives super too. <br><br>
