            Since I can't post duplicate reviews all I can tell you is that Ford is advising Explorer drivers to dangerously underinflate their tires.  Ford's recommendation is playing a part in over 50 recent deaths.  Please see my review under Accessories, Tires, Firestone, ATX.


There are several nice extra features to the car.  The lights under the rear view mirrors light up to allow for a surer step up into the vehicle and the sound system is one of the best out there. There is an an LCD display that shows how many gallons you are getting per tank (at about 16 miles a gallon it is never that much) and what the outside climate is.  With the powerful climate control system it is nice to be reminded that it is 98 degrees outside because you may forget with the AC on full blast.

In spite of the nice features the car is too big, guzzles way too much gas, and thanks to Ford's advice the tires may blow.  

I have difficulty raving about a product that I know the manufacturer has designed poorly (the little problem of tipping) and tries to compensate for its own faults by giving dangerous advice such as underinflating the tires.
