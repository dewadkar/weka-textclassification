            What prompted me to buy an Expedition?  The power of owning the road.  I can 4x4 over anything (it gets pretty fun actually).  It sits pretty high and that makes it great for driving in traffic and/or night driving.  You see what's coming up...accidents, brake lights, and curves...long before others do.    

The rear ac makes it great for road trips.  Plenty of space everywhere you look.  The tow package and luggage rack are excellent.  I can fit up to 8 snowboards on top.  It handles like a car but hauls like a truck.  Well worth the money.    

Many people complain about the gas mileage.  But you knew this before you purchased it.  My commute is 65 miles a day, round trip.  Granted, this is not the best commuting vehicle, however, the Reliability and Comfort are worth it.  Part of my commute is a 9 mile long bridge across the San Francisco Bay.  When "High Wind" advisory's are posted, driving gets difficult and plain scary.  Besides that, it handles beautifully.  Parking in the city is a breeze.  The running boards make it easier and less embarrassing when climbing into it with a short skirt on.     

People who don't like paying $45 bucks to fill up the tank twice a week should avoid this SUV.  Overall review is Excellent.  I love my Expedition!
