            The new F250 SD 4x4 Crew Cab could be called a "Go Anywhere" vehicle; but do to its size, there are a few places I can think of that you wouldn't want to take it. This is definitely not the vehicle you would want to take "off-roading" when you don't know what to expect down a new trail. If you took this truck down the wrong trail, you might have to back it out if there were a lot of trees. Because it would be an endless struggle to wedge it back around. 

<b>Tires</b>
The Lariat version of this truck with a V10 motor and all the extra necessities will run you about $35,000. If you pay that much for a vehicle, I don't believe many people are going to be "off-roading" in it. Especially since the tires that come stock on these trucks are way too small for the vehicle, and unless ordered extra aren't �All Terrain� tires, they are �All Season� tires. The tires which come stock on the F250, LT235/85R16E, are smaller than those which come stock on the Chevrolet Z71. So, if you did plan on doing some �off-roading,� or your job requires you to go in sandy or muddy places, then I would recommend at least upgrading to the LT265/75R16E All Terrain tires which will run you about $435.00 extra. Even better than that, I would get the stock tires and on the way home, stop by the tire store and order some serious off-road tires.

<b>Exterior</b>
These trucks are very well built. Ford definitely knew what they were doing when they designed these new super duty trucks. The F250 SD 4x4, unlike the smaller trucks, doesn�t come with independent front suspension. Both front and back are your regular straight axles with leaf springs and shocks. They designed the height of the truck well too. It is slightly higher and wider than most other stock trucks. Ford liked the design so much they based their new Excursion off the Super Duty design. The design has the Mac truck look to it, which is what Dodge was going for several years ago when they redesigned there Ram pickup trucks. So, the super duty truck has a slight resemblance to the Dodge � not that much though.
With the Crew Cab you also have easy access in and out for everyone. With the 6'3/4" bed the crew cab makes the truck measure 156" and with the 8' bed the truck measures 172"

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of these vehicles, with the Lariat package � which includes leather and front captain chairs with a center console, is exceptionally roomy and comfortable in the front and back. There is enough room to carry five large men. These trucks have abundant hip room and head room. If you opt for the 60/40 front seat with a fold down console there is enough room to carry six adults. It is not as comfortable as the captain chairs, but you gain that extra seat.

<b>Engines</b>
There are three engines available for the Super duty truck:
5.4L Triton(TM) V8 - 235 Horsepower @ 4250 RPM and 335 Torque @ 3000 RPM
6.8L Triton(TM) V10 - 275hp @ 2250rpm and 410 lbs-ft of torque @ 2,700rpm
7.3L Power Stroke� Turbo Diesel - 235 hp and massive torque of 500 foot-pounds at only 1600 rpm

The V10 is the engine to go with if you don't like the sound of a diesel, but if you don't mind a diesel definitely go with the 7.3L Power Stroke. With the V8 your power is too sluggish, and with the V10 your power is good but your gas mileage is not. With the 7.3L Power Stroke� Turbo Diesel your horsepower is slightly lower than the V10, but your torque is quit a difference. Also, the 7.3 gets fairly decent gas mileage - Roughly 13-17 mpg. You will pay a little more when you go to get your oil changed though - about 40 dollars instead of 30.
