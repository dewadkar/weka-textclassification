                 I bought my Ford Focus ZX3 for many reasons. It has air conditioning, cd player comes standard, it's roomy enough for five people, and there is enough room in the hatchback that I feel I am driving a mini-van. In fact,  it resembles a mini-mini-van from the outside as well. 
     The interior has many comfort features for a car this price, including adjustable seat height to accommodate the taller or shorter driver. The dash has a very modern, sweeping look. 
     Driving the car is comfortable as well. It has great handling, good speed, and convenient placement of controls. It is available with anti-lock brakes and side airbags as options, but driver and passenger front impact airbags are standard. It is also available with remote entry, which is a lifesaver when your hands are full.
    I believe this car would be great for just about anyone. Younger drivers will love the sporty look, while families can really appreciate the roominess inside.  Parallel parking is no longer an issue, because although is is cavernous inside, it is still compact outside.
    I realize that in most reviews, the cons should be addressed as well, but in my opinion, there are no cons. This is a great car at a great price. It is not a &quot;luxury car.&quot; Heated leather seats are not an option. It is not a &quot;status&quot; car either. It is a comfortable, fun and affordable mode of transportation. Check it out, it may be your next car.<br><br>
