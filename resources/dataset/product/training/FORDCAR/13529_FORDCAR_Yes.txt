            ---- Updated on 3/25/2003, Boo Explorer -----

As you can see from below, we originally loved the new Explorer. However, after owning the vehicle for about 3 years, our feeling toward Explorer (and toward Ford) turned around completely.

Every since after the first year, we have been experiencing a multitude of problems. Car won't start, tires were recalled, alarm does not work, just to name some. The dealer's repair shop are not much helpful either. Most small problems require two or more visits because they "couldn't duplicate the problem."

Recently, we believe we have a transmission problem. I say believe because after paying $89 at the dealer for diagnostic, the result was inconclusive. Get this, if we really want to find the problem, we have to pay the $2000 to take the transmission components apart.  The car is still relatively new, with less than 30,000 miles. So transmission problem is the last thing I expected.

In short, I do not recommend Ford. I will not buy another Ford. I will not repair my car at their dealer (and probably any dealer after warrantee). 

Hope this is helpful to anyone other there considering a used Ford Explorer. Try something else.

My wife and I purchased the vehicle in the summer of this year.  We decided on a SUV so we have something bigger, safer, and different than our other vehicle.  

We test drove Toyota 4Runner and Nissan Pathfinder.  Explore is noiser than both cars, but we find the handling to be smoother.  Explore feels heavier and hence (perhaps false) a sense of security.  The acceleration is comparable, and the gas mileage is slightly higher than 4Runner. In addition to 4Runner and Pathfinder, I also drove Chevrolet Blazer and Isuzu Rodeo extensively. In the end, we chose Explore because of these reasons:

1. Other than GM's Jeep and Isuzu Trooper, Explorer has the longest history on the market.  To me, the brand provides stability and quality.

2. Much better handling than Rodeo and Blazer. Rodeo's rear windshield wiper broke a few times. 

3. Easy to engage 4 wheel drive on Explorer, since it's always on auto. 

4. Explorer offers an excellent package of feature, quality, and performance. 

5. Explorer provided the most attractive package.  At the time of purchasing the vehicle, the interest rate was 2.9% for 4 years with $500 rebate.  Hence, the purchase was a breeze.  

There are a few problems with Explorer, but none are too major.  Surprisingly, one of our complaint is front passenger space.  The driver's seat feel crampy, and we are not that big of people.  Second, something does feel right with the starter. Sometimes it take more than one try to get it working. (Note: The roominess scale doesn't have my complaint, so I chose the closest match, which is 4.)

In conclusion, I highly recommend this vehicle to anyway who are interested in purchasing a SUV with a good blend of price, feature, performance, and safety.
