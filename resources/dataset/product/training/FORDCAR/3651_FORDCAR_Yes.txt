            I have been driving my &quot;moving mansion&quot; for four years. We purchased our luxury model Crown Victoria from an agency that had leased it to one owner for two years.  It had 40,000 freeway miles when we purchased it four years ago.  The car now has over 138,000 mile. The leather seats and lumbar support motion in the driver's seat made it a must for me.  My husband and I both saw the car a perfect replacement for our mini-van. The car has been terrific for our then tweeners, and now teenage daughters.  It is to me a cross between the station wagon my parents drove and the mini-van that I had driven since becoming a parent.  We wanted a vehicle that was reliable, comfortable, and spacious. Our Crown Victoria has been met all of our demands...EXCEPT one...or rather THREE..

Since we purchased the Crown Victoria, three automatic window have broken.  The first to go out was the driver window.  This happened six months after we purchased the two year old vehicle.  The front seat passenger window broke six months later.  Last week the rear right side electric window broke too.  It is a pain to have my husband fix it temporarily until he can fix.  The parts to repair one window were 120.00.  My husband added &quot;...and it wasn't easy to fix either!&quot;

Therefore, if you by a Crown Victoria recognize that it will meet many of your expectations.  However, be prepared to perhaps come across the same difficulty as we did,  with the power windows.<br><br>
