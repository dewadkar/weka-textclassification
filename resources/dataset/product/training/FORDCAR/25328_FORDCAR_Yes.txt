            I bought my 1997 Thunderbird new in August of 1997 primarily for business travel use. I got $5,000 off the list price, which was nice, and the car has been problem free ever since. The 4.6 liter V-8 runs strong and well. I have added a K&N air filter and had a larger exhaust pipe added from the catalytic converter to the Y-adapter in the rear of the car so there would be less back pressure. Both these changes have added some noticeable horsepower to the car. 

One other problem with the car is the front seat travel. It does not go back far enough for drivers six feet tall or taller. I removed my seat and drilled a new hole in the rail for the stop so I now have 2 additional inches of seat travel. Clear directions on how to do this are available at
