            I bought my Black '98 V6 Mustang in October of 1998 brand new for $14,400. I bought this cheap car because I worked in a really bad neighborhood. The only options included were the floor mats, spoiler and electric adjustable driver seat. I now have 32000 miles on it. Each mile represents a time that I've thought "Why didn't I get a V8!!!!!!" (Notice how I didn't refer to a vegetable juice in my exclamation). I'll admit that the car performs better than any other car I could have purchased for the same price. But for a few more bills, I could have avoided hearing "Cool Mustang....oh it's a V6".

I'll save the technical spec overview stuff for those folks who are more knowledgeable in the area. Here are my PROs and CONs from a layman's perspective.

PROS
I live in northern New England where it gets mighty cold. My Mustang started on the coldest day like a charm. My $36,000 2000 Jeep Cherokee Grand Laredo struggled to start and even stalled on the same mornings. Ergonomically, I find the Mustang more comfortable than my jeep on long trips. The Mustang's factory radio picks up stations that my jeep can't get as well. This is my seventh manual car and I have no complaints about the shifting.


CONS
I live in northern New England where it gets mighty cold. This car performs terribly in the snow. In the rain, this car fishtails at 15 mph while taking off from a red light. The factory radio is a bit difficult to use and I could not find an aftermarket one that looked nice. Otherwise, Myrtle (the Mustang's nickname) has treated me very well.


p.s I'm trading this car in this week for a Bimmer or a Lexus. The dealer is giving me $9800.00 for the Mustang.
