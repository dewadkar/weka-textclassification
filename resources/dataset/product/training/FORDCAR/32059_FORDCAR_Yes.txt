            I love my Explorer! We are a family of four, two car seats, and a large dog. We can all fit comfortably in our Explorer. We can no longer fit in a car. We felt like we had to have an Expedition, but honestly the Explorer is perfect for us. The back area is huge, so I have plenty of space for groceries, etc. We can load up bikes pic-nic baskets and go to the park, COMFORTABLY. 
I have a V8 engine, so I don't worry about pick-up. I have never had any major problems with my Explorer. I bought my Explorer because I had an older model Bronco and did not want to have to start paying for repairs. I was skeptical at first because I liked the size of the Bronco. I also wanted four doors to make getting children in and out easier. 
I honestly can not think about anything that I hate about my car. Well one of my back door locks is broke, I hate that.  But my son broke it so I can't really complain. We do spend quite a bit on gas (less than the Bronco, but more than economy car). I think anyone can drive an Explorer! They are comfortable and affordable. They have family appeal, but don't look like a mini-van. My husband put all the extras on it, so ours is very sporty. Their are a lot of options!<br><br>
