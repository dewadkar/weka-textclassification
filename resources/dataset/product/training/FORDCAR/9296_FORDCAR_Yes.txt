             If your looking for something along the lines of a Nissan Altima or Toyota Camray but don't want to pay the high price, the Ford Contour might just be the vehicle for you...

 We purchased a 99 Countour this spring and have been quite happy with it. The price was approximately $15,700 complete with full power package, A/C, AM/FM Cassette and Manual Transmission, with Ford financing at 5.9% Financing.

 In our Case the primary reason for purchasing this vehicle was that we needed a vehicle that was reliable and comfortable enough to seat a family of Two adults and three children ages 3, 8 and 9 (which means a Car Seat or Booster seat in the back). Of course Cost was a major consideration also, and the price definitely fit the budget better than several other vehicles in the same class with about the same options.

 Our previous vehicle was a 95 Nissan Altima and the transition from the Altima to the Contour was more like going between different model years rather than make and model, they were that similar.  The handling on both vehicles was not rough, but felt more sporty than sedan like. Likewise the comfort level is quite pleasant, but again a little more sporty feel than something along the lines of a Taurus. In fact the biggest noticable difference between the two models is that the Contour does not have quite the horspower and acceleration as it's Japanese counterparts. Don't get me wrong, the contour is not underpowered by any means, but if your used to the abundance of torque available in most of the Japanese models it may take a little getting used to.

 Actually, it really seems as though I never switched vehicles, and I have only one thing about the vehicle that I personnally dislike and that is the lack of a good place to put a oversized travel mug. All things considered that statement says a lot, as if all I can say bad is the common drink holder dilema then I think that pretty much anyone who has been buying the middle of the road Japanese compacts such as Camrays, Altima's or Galant would do well to take a look at the Contour... For price, Functionality and drivability it's definitely a contendor.<br><br>
