            My mother in law hadrecently bought this vehicle soon after her husband passed away. When she first got the vehicle, she loved it. Itt is roomy and seats up to 5 people. It as 4 wheel drive but she has yet to use it, so we don't know how well it works i the snow, yet. She has been talking about selling it because she says it is a gas hog. i peosoally think, it is the way her daughter drives it. every day she complains about how it runs, but I don't see what is wrong with it. If i had the money or could drive, i would defnatly buy this vehicle, especially since we get bad snows and four wheel drive is good in the snow. Myadvice would be for those of you out there to take care of your vehicle and not run it into the ground , like her daughter does. it was meant to be a sports vehicle not a crash ar. obey your traffic laws and things will go just fine.<br><br>
