            I purchased a Ford vehicle because my father used to work for a dealer and he trusted Ford and the people who had worked with him.  Therefore, my choices for a new car were kind of limited.  

I always wanted a black sporty car and I wanted to get one NOW before I end up married and driving a mini-van.  I chose the Ford ZX2 &quot;Cool&quot; Coupe.  I got ALL the options, sun roof, c.d. player, EVERYTHING you could possibly get as an option...so the car ended up being pretty expensive in the end. In Canada the total was $26000.00 including freight, taxes, etc.  

I love the design of the interior, the lines of the car, the superior car stereo system, the quickness of this little car.  It's truly a sports car at heart!  The interior is quite spacious for the size of car.  The only thing that I don't like about the interior is how difficult it is to get into the back seat.  I don't recommend this car if you have very tall passengers all the time or elderly people who will always be required to ride in the back.  There isn't enough space for them to get in and it is quite difficult to get out.  My grandmother ended up getting stuck trying to squeeze out of the car and laid, like a stuffed sausage in a fur coat on the floor of the car, crammed between the back seat and the the passenger seat.  But then again, I realize this car isn't a family car.  

The engine runs a little rough.  The steering wheel shakes a little with the engine on in both the car I test drove and the car I own.  But this is minor.  I love it when people are admiring my car and asking me &quot;Is that a Saturn?&quot; or &quot;What kind of car is that?&quot; and I tell them it's an Escort.  They truly are shocked to find this out.  Not so much now as there are many on the road...but when I first got the car almost two years ago it was fun to see their expressions.  

It's reliable, quick, hasn't required any major repairs as of yet.  The only thing I would say negatively about vehicle maintenance is that I will soon have to replace the two front tires; Ford put very inexpensive all-season radials on the Escort but they really are quite comparable to summer tires and have worn considerably.  But then again, they might be worn because of how quick the car is!  All in all, I love my Ford!<br><br>
