            The 95 ford mustang gt is a great car. My neighbor bought one about a month or two ago and he has had no trouble with it so far. The power plant under the hood is the 302 cubic inch 5.0 litre v8 that ford makes. That is a great engine. It produce a good of horsepower and torque. He went to the local drag strip to see what it would run. When he came back and told me i was surprised. He showed me the slip and his mustang ran 13.5 with everything stock. Thats pretty good considering he did nothing to the engine. If you are looking for a good powerful sports car then a mustang is a good choice.<br><br>
