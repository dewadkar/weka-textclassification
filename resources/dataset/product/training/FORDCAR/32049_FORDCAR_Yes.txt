              I had a Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer about 5 years ago.  I loved it all but for a 4x4 it's not much on a dirt road.  We lived 50 miles out of town and about half of that was a dirt road.  The back window leaked really bad with the dirt.  I had it in the shop repeatedly and it never was fixed right which I blame that on the dealership's service department.  Other than that, it was great.
  The ride and size of the Explorer was great.  I hope to have another one hear before long.  I have had a truck and have enjoyed it but, I still had rather have a Explorer.  I don't live on that dirt road anymore so, I would like to go back to the Explorer.
   I enjoyed the seats in the Explorer, they were very comfortable.  The stereo system was great and the room was wonderful.  I never had any trouble finding room for everything I had to put in there.  I like it better than a truck because it is closed in and I don't have to worry about my stuff getting messed up in the back.  I hope everyone that has a Explorer enjoy's there's like I did mine.<br><br>
