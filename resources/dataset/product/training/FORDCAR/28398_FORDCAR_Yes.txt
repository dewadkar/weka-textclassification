I feel I am at least somewhat qualified to speak about ford vehicles. I have had quite a few, and I'm not that old. Most of them were pretty good, only one bad one (1996 Contour), and I have traded regularly, not because they aren't good cars, but I just get bored. 

In July 2003 I purchased a Black 2002 Ford Taurus SES. 
I wanted something front wheel drive, four door, sporty, but snappy and good on gas. I found it in a 2002 Taurus SES. The car is just amazing. I have had it for going on 6 months now, and I love it more very day. 

The build quality is just amazing, little to no road/wind noise. Ford went all out to build a vehicle that can stand the test of today&#146s drivers, like me.  Lets face it most people pound on their vehicles quite a bit, and this vehicle can take it and then some.

Gas mileage is pretty good. Before this car, I had a 2000 Ford F-150 !!GAS HOG!!  Around 14 MPG, and that was when I was nice to it. If I pushed it hard I averaged around 11MPG. The Taurus was a god-send in this scenario. With the Taurus, I have been averaging 23mpg on 87-octane gas. I tried a couple times being really nice to it, and it got around 27 or so, that&#146s with city and highway driving. 

Ford also went all out to give the new Taurus a look like no other. Lets face it, the 1996-1999 were potato cars. They worked well as rentals or cheap used cars, but with a design like that, no wonder GM was laughing. For the 2000 Model year the upgrade was well needed and well designed. It gives the Taurus a sporty, yet serious look. The Perfect family car if I may say. For driving the family around town or to Grandma&#146s for Christmas dinner, the car is wonderful. Plenty of Room, especially in the trunk. You could fit an elephant in there, well, u know what I mean. Also, it is great for Mom or Dad&#146s day out. The car handles beautifully and you could almost think it was a sports car, if you didn&#146t notice the big backseat.

Safety is another road Ford decided to take with the Taurus. From advanced the sensitive SRS system to the extra protection in the rear for car seats, this car is one the best piece of minds out there for families. Ask anyone about how safe the Taurus is, and I guarantee they will collaborate what I have said. Very, very safe car. 

I will update in the future, but as of this point, the car is a dream come true! Go out and get one ASAP!
