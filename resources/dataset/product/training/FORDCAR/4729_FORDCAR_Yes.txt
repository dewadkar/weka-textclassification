            I looked at a 96 mustang back in 1997 when I was car shopping.  The mustang attracted me because the 1994 body redesign was simply beautiful.  I loved how Ford captured that origional mustang style by killing off the just plain retarded looking &quot;fox&quot; chasis design that lived way too long.  

The kind I test drove was a black &quot;LX&quot; model that was in mint condition!  The LX package I sampled was made to immitate the look of a GT with the rear spoiler, color key mouldings, etc.  The car drove immaculately, but power was dissapionting.  The 3.8 V6 combined with an automatic transmission barely moves this &quot;sports&quot; car.  However, the feel of the engine and drivetrain was very quality.  The engine runs sooper smooth in all driving conditions and the shifts are hardly perceptable.  

The interior of the car is nicely done in cheap plastic that doesn't look all that cheap.  I specifially liked the symetrical dashboard and the retro looking &quot;hump&quot; on the dash that houses the clock.  All gauges are large and clear as are the climate control and radio buttons and switches.  The front seats are comfortable, but lack enough side boulster height.  The rear seats are a joke!  The roof line of the car is way too low for anyone over 5'6&quot; to sit comfotable w/o banging their head on the liner back there.  Leg room is also scarce in the back. 

The exterior is what I hatted about this car.  As much as Ford tried to make it look like a GT, the differences that they left between the models litterally SCREAM the works NOT A GT!!!!!  The tiny 14 inch alloy wheels are a joke.  They look very unproportional on the car and don't even come close to filling up the wheel wells.  Also, the black plastic inserts that cap the fog light location the front bumper look very cheap.  Why Ford refuses to make wheels at least 15 inchers and add fog lights is puzzing.  The cars would look much better with these TWO accessories and I don't imagine cost to be affected significantly.  I'd say mass factory production would make these two options affordable and probably below $300 in addition to the price of the car.  

All of that aside, I feel the V6 should be dropped completely.  Mustang should be all about performance!  Offering only a GT and SVT made Corba will make buyers feel like they own a real sports car.  Oh, and if Ford is affrid it will loose performance enthusiasts if the special version is a $30K+ Corbra, well they have the Corbra R.  Also, they should itroduct vingtage packages like a &quot;Bullit&quot; version GT which resembles the one Steve McQueen drove in his flick.  

If the V6 is dropped, the GT should be an all option based car that a person starts to build up from a V8 (wish it was the 5.0 instead of the 4.6, but oh  well), six speed gearbox, and heater.  This base car woudl probably cost under $16K.  Customers should be free to add options individually instead of buying packages.  

I was really dissaponited with the way they screwed up the 1999 model.  They ruined a pretty car.  Hopefully the next redesign will be better.  I recommend the mustang, but not the V6. <br><br>
