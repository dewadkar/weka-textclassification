            I have never driven affordable true sport sedan until now.My 99 Contour SE,V6,5speed is the best kept secret in the country.Even insurance companies don't know about it.This car is so called &quot;sleeper&quot;.I have had it for about 6 months and still learn new tricks like starting from second gear or cruise on 4-th at 25miles/hour or change my mind and switch to overdrive/5-th/from second.I don't even care about little problems while changing lines instantly or flying thru sharp turns.My car is the essence of my road philosophy.No hot rood enthusiast takes the Contour seriously /what is very beneficial to me if i have to get from point A to point B quickly and safely/.Before they realize what's  going on, I am gone and they have hard time catching up to me.
Contour V6,5speed is very rare breed,most of them have been altered by Ford's Special Vehicle Team/Contour SVT/.The mods inflicted on Contour created a different driving machine-mean and loud with threatning look,but SVT is still not a hot rood only looks like one.And I still love my underdog.<br><br>
