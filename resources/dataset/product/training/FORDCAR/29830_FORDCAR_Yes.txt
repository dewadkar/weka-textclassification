                When I wanted a new compact wagon back in '96, I shopped the Hyundai, Saturn and Ford Escort.  I settled on the Escort because it was $6,000 cheaper than a similarly equipped Saturn, and because Hyundai had less dealerships nationwide and we were contemplating a move to a remote area.
I have never been disappointed.  Four years and $71,000 miles of hard driving later, this car had never given me any problems.  
   We had one minor malfunction in the speedometer (whirred uncontrollably over 70rpm).  Parts for maintenance are cheap and easy to find.  The car is prone to dings on the side panels at the slightest touch.....most other wagons of this year have the same number of dings as I do.
   Mileage is great except going up mountains.  If you drive up a mountain with the AC on, you can pretty much watch the needle go down.
    The 40/60 split back seat is a wonderful feature for traveling or moving and hauling.  Our family of four has taken this car on many long trips and found it to be quite comfortable.  We also managed to fit a rather large hand-tooled, wide seat Virginia rocking chair into the back for moving just fine.  
    These cars seem to hold their value pretty well on resale to, so if you find one...I say thumbs up!<br><br>
