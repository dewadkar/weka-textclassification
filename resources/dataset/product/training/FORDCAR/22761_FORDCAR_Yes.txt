            I have always been a  Ford car buyer and decided to try the Explorer.  I bought a 1993 Ford Explorer XL and I love it.  I thought I could never get away from the Ford Cougar...which I still love. I have wanted an SUV which  I did try out the Chevy Blazer ...it was Ok but I am short and I could not see in it ...and I am an avid fan of Fords..with this being my eighth Ford vehicle and I have had no problems with any of them.  I am a very satisfied customer and plan to buy another one when I trade again ..thanks  Ford! <br><br>
