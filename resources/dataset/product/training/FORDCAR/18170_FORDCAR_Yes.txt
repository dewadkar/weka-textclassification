            1996 - I needed to buy a car so that I could drive 300 miles to see the love of my life (should have know it would not last).  And spend $20,000.00 to do it.  All that became of that relationship was that I did finally own my first NEW car!  What a Great car, the car was sporty but let me tell you.  It would drive in the snow.  The 96 Ford Probe was an all around good vehicle.  I am sure that I never changed the oil (heck what girl knows or cares how to do that)?  The only thing I could say bad about this car was that the windshield wiper motor needed to be replaced several times, this is the same with all Fords I believe.  And the heat, Fords seem to think that the looks of the car alone is enough heat.
I ran that car for 12 years and would recommend it to anyone.  My husband was driving the car (no, not the one I had to have it for), and was rear ended by a drunk driver at a stop light, the car was traveling about 40-50 miles an hour and the Probe was in perfect shape.  You could only tell my the bumper being pushed in a tiny bit.  Can't say that about the other guys car.<br><br>
