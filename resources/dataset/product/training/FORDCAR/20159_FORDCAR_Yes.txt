            In March of 2000 we bought the Ford Windstar LX to accommodate the addition of our first child.  That first year we put close to 20,000 miles on the vehicle with no problems at all.  We currently as of July 2003, have over 60,000 miles on the car.  It still has been relatively problem free.

Some nice features that I like about our van are the above console which features a conversations mirror, sunglass holder, and change holder.  Being a tall man, it is easy for me to reach up and get everything I need.  The conversation mirror is great to check on my 3 year old.  We also have a cassette player with CD, privacy glass, automatic sliding door (a must with children), a floor console, dual A/C, and dual stereo controls.  The van is also long enough to handle everything you need when traveling.  We have a luggage rack on the top, but have never had to use it.  The convenience and reliability of this vehicle have been awesome since we purchased it.

The only downside would be the city miles per gallon which I would say we are only getting about 18 per gallon currently and the factory speakers are not the greatest.  Of course you can always upgrade stereo equipment.
