                 I own a 1992 Ford Explorer/Eddie Bauer and I love it.  I purchased it in 1995 from a physician who used it primarily for highway driving (between his 2 offices).  When I bought it, it had roughly 74,000 miles on it.  I was slightly concerned with the mileage it had on it but I knew the reputation of the &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot; version and knew I had to have it.  
     My SUV now had 145,000 miles on it and shows no signs of giving up on me yet!  I couldn't have asked for a better vehicle, especially getting it used with that kind of mileage.  I have maintained regular oil changes, and replaced the brakes once (both front and back).  I bought 4 new tires when it had 119,000 miles and replaced the battery shortly after that.  Not bad, don't you think?  I never imagined having a car with 145,000 miles on it.  The only real wear that it has is the rust on the bottoms of both rear doors.  It is getting to the point that I might have to get the bottom painted (it's Tu-tone and the top is fine).  It has met all of my needs.  I have my 4X4 which is a must where I live and travel in the winters, It is my 4-door car which is great with my 2 boys, and it is my hauling truck which is bigger than most SUV's in the back.
     One of my only dislikes is the security system that was factory installed on it.  I have 2 &quot;clickers&quot;.  They have an &quot;A&quot; to alarm the vehicle and a &quot;D&quot; to disalarm it.  You must and I repeat, you must disalarm it to start the truck whether you have the system activated or not.  This has caused many problems over the years when batteries in the &quot;clicker&quot; die and you're stuck not being able to start the truck.  The other problem with the system is whether it is on or not, it can be activated by others.  For instance, several times when the police car circles my block on routine patrol the alarm in my truck goes off due to it being on the same frequency as the police radio.  Same thing with an ambulance and also with both neighbors who live across the street.  Both of their cars that have keyless entries set off my truck alarm.  For example, every time my neighbor uses her &quot;clicker&quot; to open her car trunk, my truck alarm goes off.  Very annoying at 3am!  I just need to get that stupid system disconnected and everything would be fine.
     To conclude, I highly recommend the Ford Explorer/Eddie Bauer version to anyone interested in a new or used SUV.  It's not my truck's fault that it has a stupid security system in it.  I must admit I like trying other vehicles but when my truck finally dies I might just replace it with another Eddie!!!
