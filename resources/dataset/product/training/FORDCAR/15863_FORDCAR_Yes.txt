            <b>Introduction</b>
This is my boss's vehicle.  I had the task of driving it 140 miles to the fleet dealership that replaced the transmission.  This car couldn�t be more plush, it has the full XLT package, leather interior, six-disc CD changer, all sorts of options on the electronic seats, shift on the fly 4x4 and the 4.0-liter engine.  Along with all of the other power do-dads.

<b>Pros</b>
This vehicle may have just taken my vote for best Ford ever produced.  I instantly fell in love with the styling, comfort, interior, power, everything to do with this vehicle.

First of all, that puny little 4.0-liter fuel injected engine.  It put some surprising power to the ground.  Especially with the traction controls.  0-60 was tested at 6,500 ft to be between 10 and 11 seconds.  Of course you lose some gas mileage with this kind of power.  I think I gained those extra seconds over my mothers 1995 S-10 Blazer with 4.3 Vortec because her final gear is 3.04.  I don�t know the exact differential gearing in the Exploder, but my educated guess is going to be around 3.8.

Second is the comfort this XLT offered.  The leather interior had the full wrap around features with Lumbar support.  Some sort of gas charged or air charged things on the side of the seat hugged my thighs and knees tightly, making for an oddly comfortable combination.  My moms Blazer has electronic seats, but they are slow, the controls in the Explorer were pleasantly quick.  I started to get sore about 60 miles into my exploration, but I removed my wallet and the problem went away.  From which I was fine for the remainder of the trip.

Next comes that CD player and sound system.  I thought it must have been an after-market setup with the excellent treble and ok Bass I was getting.  My boss told me it was what came in it in 1995.  The sound controls were easy to operate, clearly marked, with only slight movement from myself to reach the controls.  It was a slight nuisance that the CD player shared the same controls as the AM/FM radio, but I found that I got over that very quickly as they were easy to operate.

I can�t make a valid assumption of the reliability of this car since my boss/friend really takes care of his vehicles.  He has a late 80�s Bronco (big one, not II) that runs and looks better than it did new.  But, I�m going to make an assumption here, before you purchase one of these, you may want to ask other drivers about their reliability.  The engine in this vehicle is immaculate.  I can still feel all 160 horses pulling strong after 95,000 miles.  There was absolutely no oil leakage anywhere, and there were no major repairs in his maintenance book.  A kid I work with has a �94 Explorer that isn�t quite as nice, but he has had no engine or transmission problems after over 100,000 miles.  <b>One thing to look for is the thermostats on the 4.0-liter engine.  I know of three 4.0-Liter engines that have met an early demise because of malfunctioning thermostats.  It is one thing that definitely needs a recall.</b>

The air conditioning could be a high point in this vehicle.  The temperature gauge on the upper console said 93 degrees.  Inside with just the A/C(not max) blowing I was more than comfortable, at one point I even needed to turn it down.

You know I am going to hate saying this, but I like the styling on these vehicles more than late model Blazer�s.  Don�t get me wrong, I love the way Blazer�s look, just not as much as the Explorers.  The paint is still shiny and perfect after nearly 100K miles of driving.

Rear seat room is phenomenal, easily offering four more inches than the Blazer.  (Not researched)  Sitting in the rear seat is almost as comfortable as the front.  Folding the seat down is also very easy for more cargo room.

<b>Neutral</b>
The stock alloy wheels are gorgeous, but a much nicer hubcap could have been implemented to cover the lugs.

Gas mileage could be better than 19-21, but I guess for an SUV that is pretty good in most cases.  A Blazer with the same size rear-end gearing will get the same mileage.

The transmission has the odd feature of displaying OD, 2, and 1.  In order to be in just drive you have to push a button on the end of the shifter.  A minor annoyance, but still enough to mention.  On the �95 Blazer you have OD, D, 2, 1 all on the shift column.

The steering column was adjustable as per height, and breaking a major rule in the Department of Transportation handbook, I adjusted it while I was in motion.  It is spring-loaded and the second I pulled the lever, the column was all the way to the up position, at 65 mph.  I had muscle it back down to a setting that was comfortable for me.  Luckily I had the common sense to do this on a straight stretch or it could have ended tragically.

The cruise control held speed shifting up or down according to speed it needed to maintain.  It is the first cruise controls I have ever driven that closely monitors high-end speed.  My problem lies in the buttons.  They are leather covered and there is no firm click to let you know it is on.  There is a light in the dash to combat this, but I really missed the reassuring click.

<b>Cons</b>
This may sound silly, but the worst thing that I found with this truck/SUV/Luxury car was that the tachometer redlines at 6,000 rpms.  Now, that is a respectable RPM range, my problem is that the line, number and line under the number are all painted red.  Every-time I did a gauge scan I saw that red six as a warning light.  This happened not once, not twice, but four times.  It was driving me crazy.  I would have to pull the dash apart and paint over that 6 with finger nail polish or something.

Getting out of this vehicle, no matter the seat position, was difficult.  I had to slide over the left seat cushion, and in between the steering wheel, I found it to be awkward every time(3 times).  I don�t think you would get used to it, and would probably end up wearing out the seat before a comfortable way to get out would be found.

After a very gentle(like I said, my friend loves this SUV) 95,000 miles with 99% of it done by one driver, 90% highway, the transmission slips and is leaking badly.  It is currently in the shop being replaced.  This vehicle was never used to tow anything heavier than a Kawasaki Vulcan (700 lbs.) and its trailer(500 lbs.).  So, towing is not the culprit.

I�m kind of digging for cons here, I didn�t find much I didn�t like about this vehicle.  One thing that annoys me with all new vehicles are the windshield wipers.  They come on after you push the button and keep going for three or four revolutions.  Not so bad except that in the Explorer they don�t work all that well, I had to stop at a gas station to clean all of the bugs off of the windowshield, even freshly splattered ones.

The rear glass felt kind of flimsy, and I didn�t really like the way the disconnect was mounted.  It destroys the rear lines of the vehicle, but it serves its purpose.

<b>Overall</b>
I would still take the Blazer, only because I�m biased.  Also, my mothers Blazer is fully loaded and cost a full $3,000 more new than this XLT Explorer.

The seat controls on the Explorer are definitely superior, as is the styling.  The transmission in the Blazer is proven to last longer in most opinions you�ll read on Epinions.

This vehicle is perfect for small to mid-size families, small towing projects, and campers since the seats fold down exceptionally easy.

If you are a Ford fan, get the Exploder, if you like Chevrolet�s get the Blazer.  I didn�t find enough of a difference in either to lean in either direction.  You may end up paying more for the Blazer, but that all depends on where you shop for your used cars.

<b>Post Review</b> You don�t even want to get me started on the Contour loaner car I had to drive back.  My other Contour review would cover it nicely, only this one was a 1997 and I could see the difference in quality.  The 1998 is much nicer, but no where near perfect.<br><br>
