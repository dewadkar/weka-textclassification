            I currently own an Aspire and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it. 

One of the great things about this car is the mileage.  I can fill it up and it will go forever.  However this car really does not handle well.  One gust of wind, and I am blown all over the road. 

I recently had a blow-out going about 55 mph on the highway.  The driving conditions were ideal, but I my car was thrown into the side-railing of a bridge and the damage accrued from this simple blow-out is going to be about $2000 dollars.   This estimate is the average from 3 body shops. When the blow-out of my tire occurred I really did not realize how much damage the little bang had done until I tried to change the damaged tire. 

These cars are not made well.   I would not call them safe cars because of the amount of damage I sustained from such a seemingly simple fender bender.
