            In 1990, I was looking for a small truck to replace the other one that I had. A shiny,red, brand new Ford Ranger caught my eye immediately. I took it for a test drive and fell in love with it! It handled like a dream and had really great gas mileage. I drove it in the Rocky Mountains with virtually no problems almost every weekend. My Ranger handled the 7% and the 9% grades with ease. I have hauled everything from furniture to hay with my Ranger.I even hauled my two full grown horses 1300 miles with it,  for a 2wheel drive small truck, I thought that was pretty good! It is a 5 speed manual which I think is great in the snow if you get somewhat stuck! The only thing that I really don't care about it is that I am long legged and the seat does not go back far enough. But I would definitely recommend this type of vehicle to anyone, regardless of height! This truck is a workhorse in every sense of the word. Another plus with the Ranger is the longevity of these vehicles. Mine has just shy of 200,000 miles on it. It has all of the original components. These little trucks are the bomb!!<br><br>
