            I always wanted a Mustang, and one year my husband thought I deserved to get what I had desired for so long.  I didn't think I need a convertible, but my husband thought it would be more fun.  So, we purchased a brand new red Mustang GT Convertible in the summer of 1997.

Initially, since we were not used to sports cars, we thought there was a problem with our Mustang, because it vibrated so much.  After taking it to a dealer and having the mechanic drive it, we discovered this was just the way this particular model road.  Plus, this sort of gives a driver a feeling of being one with the powerful V8 engine.  Vroom! Vroom!

The car is compact, and probably not the most practical vehicle for me to use drive my 3 yr. old places, but this is primarily how I use it.  I only have about 8,000 miles on the car!  When the passenger seat is too far back, my son (who rides in a carseat) does not have ample leg room.  

The convertible top is fairly easy to open and close.  A person does have to stop the car and put on the emergency break to raise and lower the roof, but this is probably a very good safety measure.  The back seat gets the most wind when the top is open.  My son doesn't like the wind, and often asks us not to open the top when he's riding in the car.

The gas tank cap had a trick to opening it, and my husband didn't follow the instructions one of the first times the tank was filled, so now the cap is just twists off just like any other.  The Mustang is a gas guzzler, by the way.

Overall, I love my Mustang GT Convertible, and I hope to drive it for many years.<br><br>
