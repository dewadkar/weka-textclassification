            This Escort was bought new by me in 1996. It was my first car and I couldn't be more pleased with it! The model I bought came with some extra's, like a CD player, moon roof, and a superior sound system. I got those extra's practically free since the price for the car itself was so reasonable.

After 4 years of driving it, and over 50,000 miles, I can honestly say that I haven't had ANY problems at all with it! I also must add that it is an amazing snow car! I have never slipped or slid, even in bad snow storms. 

Both my mom and my sister bought Escorts also, though theirs were 96 models. They have also had perfect performance and reliability! My mom works at a hospital and so getting to work or not in a snowstorm is not really an option. She uses her Escort, right along with the workers in 4x4's to pick up people who's cars wont get them there safely.

Lastly, I recently became a mother and feel very grateful to have such a safe car to drive my baby in.<br><br>
