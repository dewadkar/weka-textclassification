            My husband owns a 1998 Ford Escort ZX2.  He loves his little car.  He always talks about it and talks of how people compliment him on the look of the car.  At first we bought this car because of the low price.  As we began to drive it more often we decided we liked it better than cars we've owned in the past.  The  things I love about this car is the quick acceleration and sporty look.  The gas mileage is good for a sports car.  We usually get around 35 city 45 highway.  The downfalls are the lack of head room and the loud running engine.  It is nice to drive this vehicle around town because of how fast it will get up and go.  It is easy to pass slow drivers and make that yellow light.  I think this car would be best for the teenagers.  Thanks<br><br>
