            We have and '87 Ford Taurus Station Wagon!  I absolutely love it!  It's a 5 speed which is really unusual!  The gas mileage is wonderful!  It has enough room for all the kiddos and mom and dad...and all the extras when you want to go shopping!
We have taken this car on road trips, shopping etc etc.. and it always seems to have enough room in it for everything!  Even going to the beach!  You just pack up and go!
The kids love it because of how spacious it is!  I can't blame them either!  They aren't fighting as much when we travel somewhere!  That's always a lifesaver in a vehicle!
If you haven't checked any of these out I would recommend that you do it!  It will be well worth your time and money :)<br><br>
