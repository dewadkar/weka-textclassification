            I purchased our Taurus new in May of 1993 for my wife.  Our children were 11 and 7 and we were looking for a safe vehicle.  This turned out to be a wise decision.  In December of 1983 I was on my way to pick up my wife, my son was in the front seat with me, when a car turned in front of me and I broadsided him.  The airbag deployed.  Although the front end was seriously damaged, my son and I were not hurt.  As far as safety is concerned, I have nothing but good things to say about the Taurus.  However, there are some things that I do not like.  The interior has not fared well.  It feels cheap.  The carpet and seats have been taken care of and look ok.  The door panels are loose.  Clips that held them up have broken.  The covers for the handles to roll down the windows are all loose and one has broken.  The dashboard rattles.  Mechanically, the car was great for the first 100,000 miles.  Only one problem that sticks in my mind.  The motor mounts were replaced twice under warranty and I paid to have them replaced once.  However, after 100,000 miles the car seems to breakdown regularly.  We have 126,000 miles on the car today.  The power steering pump started whining.  I have had the fluid drained and replaced. Didn't fix it.  Replaced it.  The replacement whined.  Replaced that (free).  It was much quieter.  The hose sprang a leak and had to be replaced.  Now the pump is whining loud and proud again.  A piece of the A/C system broke.  It is called a muffler and longish tube with a dryer in the middle.  The original was attached to the car about 4 inches from the dryer.  This allowed the dryer to swing forward and back as the car moved and eventually the weld where the tube attached to the dryer broke.  All freon in the system escaped.  The part was over $200 and in total the repair cost me $500.  After this was replaced I took the car to a Ford dealer to have the motor mounts replaced again.  The bolt on one of the motor mounts fell out while we were out of town one weekend.  Drove the car back to the dealer early the next week and they replaced the bolt and apologized.  However, the A/C stopped blowing cold air.  Come to find out, the muffler had broke again.  Wonder if driving 400 miles with the bad motor mount had anything to do with it???  Guess what the dealer said.  Ten months, but 13,000 miles later (12 months or 12,000 mile warranty) the motor mounts broke again.  Other things like the oil pan gasket (oil puddles in the garage), the starter, the water pump, the radiator and the fan motor have also been replaced since hitting 100,000 miles.
The car drives ok.  Not a lot of acceleration in the V-6 engine, but it gets the job done.  Handling is ok.  Gas mileage was rated 22/25 new.  Driving mostly in the city it is 18 to 20 today.  It passes the air pollution inspection with flying colors.  Almost no pollution. <br><br>
