It is the best selling car in the world. Something Ford seems to want to keep a secret. I bought the Focus four door sedan. For people that would feel comfortable in a small car.You'll love the room in the Focus. But like any small car, if your 6'5 or taller or smaller but more robust. The Focus or any small compact is not going to have enough room for you. One real nice thing I liked about the Focus was the AM/FM radio with compact Disc. The radio has a removable face plate to help prevent theft and it could be adjusted to get louder the faster you went, to compensate for road noise at higher speeds.That worked out great. There are fasteners to hold your front floor mats in place so they don't ride up by the peddles. Something you usually didn't find in the cheaper cars. The backs of the rear seats would fold flat to give you a lot of room inside And handles mounted inside, above the doors to help you get in or out.
I was able to put three 10' pieces of gutter through the trunk and up to the dash. My big disappointment with the Focus was with the trunk lid. While the trunk it's self will hold two weeks of groceries with no problem. I couldn't get a box holding a 17" picture tube through the trunk lid. Around town and on flat roads, the Focus had plenty of get up and go for a four banger. Going up mountains it was a little slower.You can expect to get around 26-28 MPG in the summer with the A/C on and doing 40/60 city/highway driving. Up to 31-33 on highway driving. My biggest problem with the Focus was when I was changing lanes and another car came into the same lane I was going into. I saw him and turned the wheel sharp to get out of that lane and the car fish tailed on me pretty hard before I could straiten it up. For the money though. I think the Focus is the best small car Ford has made in years. For the average size person, I think you'll like the room it has and features it's got.
