            I absolutely could not picture myself with two kids and a station wagon. In fact, the only thing worse would be two kids and a mini-van. But, I was in fact, a mom with two kids and a station wagon. Not just a station wagon but one with wood on the sides. Well, not really wood (<i>I�m not quite that old</i>) but a yellow Ford station wagon with wood looking patterned Contact Paper-like sides on my car. Did I feel, �cool?� No, I didn�t. Did I like the car? After the shock of seeing myself in a picture in the station wagon, the answer would have to be yes. I did adjust. There was lots of room. The kids loved riding in it and it fit my car pooling needs exactly. So I drove it for eight years and then it was time to get a new car. 

I looked at all the models that I�d been waiting eight, long years for - the sleek, the sexy, the designer models. Then my husband said, �Let�s look at the new kind of car that Chrysler makes.� I was game and we went to a dealership. The �car� was the first mini-van known to man (and woman!) It was the 1985 Dodge Mini-Van. This boxy looking vehicle was all the rage of car buyers that year. I tried really hard to get him looking at a Daytona but he was longing for a mini-van. So, I talked myself into thinking of it as a cool new model that would add a �sporty� look to me, a rapidly aging �cool� model. And yes, darn it I did really like driving it. It was front wheel drive and great in the winter. I was driving the kids in a car pool five days a week to a school a half-hour away and it never let me down. It lasted 10 years and was great! 

At that point the kids were driving themselves. They were mainly grown and I didn�t need to haul six sweaty soccer players home after a long hot game anymore (a mini-van is roomy enough to add breathing room to situations like this.) I needed a new car- a mature �cool� car that expressed the real me. Preferably I wanted a two-door car <i>not made for kids. </i>My sister-in-law was newly married and had a baby on the way. She had to sell her car because they had decided to get a�.mini-van. Ha! I thought. Better her than me. 

So I did us both a favor, I bought her 1988 Thunderbird. Yes, you heard me right. Finally I had a great car with a sleek design. Not only that, but it had <b>two doors!</b> It had lots of get up and go with its 8-cylinder engine and to be honest, I got-up-and went whenever I had the opportunity. But to my dismay, I found that it sat so low to the ground that I either bumped my head getting in or messed up my hair (or both.) In the winter, I had to put a cement block in the trunk because it fish tailed on ice and snow because it was equipped with rear-wheel drive. It knew every gas station between home and work and I only drive 10 miles to work! The insurance agent figured that I must be so �cool� and hip that I probably raced the car and my insurance rates were exorbitant. This �sporty� model didn�t add to my chic, or my driving safety, but instead found ways to empty my wallet on a regular basis. After two winters, I was ready to admit that maybe that sports car (according to the insurance rates) was a <i>little too sporty for me.</i> 

I went car shopping. 

I finally had no doubt about the vehicle that I wanted. I wanted a vehicle that would have room to transport my school stuff back and forth. I wanted room to have my two grown children have a comfortable ride when we went on vacations. I wanted to be able to drive my elderly in-laws in comfort, even when we had the two kids with us. So, I bought the <b>only</b> vehicle that made sense for my needs and made me happy to drive.

 A new 1996 Windstar Mini-Van. It�s important to know what your needs are and match them with the vehicle that meets your needs. This vehicle does. For me, I was looking for these things:

(1) I wanted to sit up high when I drove. I learned that from the first mini van I owned. When you sit high, you are able to anticipate traffic ahead. You can see what is happening <i>before</i> it happens! This model has a large windshield and added to the height of the seat, on a clear day you can see (forever?) Maybe not forever, but it definitely gives you a huge advantage of seeing as much of the road ahead as it�s possible to see. Plus, I don�t bump my head getting into the vehicle. You step up not down.

(2) I wanted a front or four wheel drive. This has a front wheel drive and I�m back to safe winter driving without sandbags or blocks in my trunk for traction on ice and snow. (I do keep some kitty litter there in case I get stuck somewhere.)  I WILL NEVER own a rear wheel drive again. <b>I cannot express the total difference that front wheel drive makes to winter driving. I never slip and slide at stop lights and it makes it actually hard to get stuck because it is pulling your car forward through the snow.</b> I think that when on ice, there is little difference in front, back or four wheel drives. It�s purely treacherous for them all.
 
(3) Roominess was important. Now that the kids are grown, it takes more room for everyone to be comfortable. This vehicle seats seven adults comfortably. It has bucket seats in the front, two bucket seats in the middle (although I prefer the bench like I had in my other one because it allows more room to get into the back section from the side door and extra floor room to put packages in)�but buckets were what came with this one on the lot.) The back bench seats the three people.

(4) Airbags are on both the driver and the passenger side of this vehicle. I think that�s an important safety feature. (It�s been rumored that the engineer that first made air bags was a man who thought about the safety of the driver because the driver of this van would be another man. I learned this in one of my college classes and have no idea if it is true but I thought that it was interesting. 

(5) I wanted a windshield wiper/washer for the back window. I really missed this feature when I had the Thunderbird. You really need the rear window defroster, as well.

(6) I wanted a well-appointed console. This was another feature that the last car I owned didn�t have. I like having a place and room to store things. This vehicle also has nice drink holders that are attached on each side of the ashtray. It holds up to a medium size fast food drink. The console on this model also has a drawer, a flip up compartment door that offers lots of storage room and a holder for tapes. I do not have a CD player on this vehicle but I do have a stereo am/fm radio and tape player. I mainly have tapes so I don�t miss the CD player. Some models do however, have this feature that can be installed.

(7) I wanted cloth, not vinyl seats. The other car had the vinyl which gets �really� cold in the winter and �really� hot in the summer. The upholstery is easy to keep clean and spills wipe right up.

(8) Another important feature to me, found on this model, was the electric door locks and I got the remote door entry. I love these two things. The doors lock automatically when you put the car into drive. You can lock and unlock the doors with the small remote that is carried on your key chain. 

(9) Good gas mileage is important to most people. I�m sometimes fooled into thinking that I�m getting good mileage because my gas tank is big and holds 25 gallons. Since I only drive about 20 miles a day to work and back, it seems to last forever. I have checked it though and I only get about 18 miles a gallon. The sticker estimated 17mpg-city and 23 mpg highway. It�s close to what I get.

(10) I wanted a 6-cylinder engine. The old mini-van was a 4 and it barely got me up hills and I couldn�t count on it to pick up quickly if I needed to get out of the way or avoid an accident. This car has a 6-cylinder engine and it really does the job. Even when the van is loaded with bodies, it has a quick pick up.

What don�t I like about this Ford Windstar? (1) Well, I didn�t wait until 1997 to buy it. In 1997, the Windstar came equipped with doors on both sides to get into the middle and back of the van. Mine only has a sliding door which opens on the passenger side. This is very awkward when unloading groceries or putting small kids in and out. I also find that the sliding door is dangerous for kids and older people. They tend to hang onto the divider between the sliding door and the front door and I�ve had both a child and an elderly person get their fingers shut in the door because of this arrangement. The sliding door is very heavy to slide, too. Kids never shut it tightly from within or even when on the outside. (2) The rear gate lifts up and is very heavy to pull down and close tightly. I also find that when the car is in the garage and I put up the hatch to unload groceries, the top often hits and sticks to our garage door. (3) I wish that mini-vans came with a drop down step for the side (and maybe the passenger side too) entrance. My mother-in-law is 86 and it is hard for her to get into and out of the van. I actually carry around a small wooden box for her to use. (4) The back bench and the bucket seats are removable to permit hauling items in it, like a full-sized van. This model, along with my last model, makes it very difficult to do. It takes a lot of effort and at least two people to remove and replace these seats. (5) Lastly, I wish that there were a lady-like way for me to get into and out of a vehicle this high. I am short (5�3�) and I really have to stretch my shorter legs. In slacks it�s a nuisance but in a skirt it�s an embarrassment.

I liked my Dodge Mini-van but this Windstar model has tested out to be rated the safest mini-van vehicle over all the different models for a few years in a row. It handles really well, too. It has enough pick up to get me ahead of the others at a light and the power steering lets me turn and take corners with ease. I hate too much �play� in a steering wheel but this one is just right to provide easy control. Because of the height of the mini-van, you sometimes can feel the push and pull when there are high winds but that doesn�t hurt anything but the gas mileage. Maneuverability in any situation is easy even for someone of my stature and arm strength. (I have no knowledge of the words muscle and arm in the same sentence.) Another important thing to keep in mind is that although the mini-van appears and is longer than some cars, it is easy to park. I pull into any size parking space without a problem. 

My mini van will be 4 years old in November and I have only had repairs done on it during this last year. It has 32,000 miles on it and I have had to have the door locks fixed (part of the problem they couldn�t find to fix, which has been aggravating. The door between the air conditioning and the heater is stuck and this has proved expensive recently. Ford makes the consumer buy the whole unit rather than the small part. We have had an estimate of over $700 to replace and therefore repair this problem. 

Engine-wise (and anything else Under the hood) I have never had to have anything done but a battery replaced. My maintenance routine is that  I usually take it to a Fast Lube place every 4-5 thousand miles. So I definitely consider this model to be dependable.

My husband now needs to replace his car. He drives about 60 miles a day and it would make sense for us to lease me a car and have him take the Windstar.  I really don�t want to rent a Windstar and have two mini-vans, but I really don�t want to have anything else to drive. I really like driving a Mini-Van <b>THAT</b> much!

So, if you are an individual with enough self confidence to buy what really suits your needs and not your self-image; if you are not into �coolness� images or afraid of becoming a mini-van �stereotype� then I recommend the Ford Windstar. If your transportation needs are similar to mine, this is the best vehicle available and I highly recommend that you join the community of mini-van drivers.
