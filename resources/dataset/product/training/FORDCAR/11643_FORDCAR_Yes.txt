            We just had a baby and our sports car just wasn't going to cut it.  Originally I thought I would like the 4Runner the best, but now I have a new favorite.  It may be used, but my Ford Explorer Limited is my newest baby.  I can't believe how smooth the ride is and how much room it has.  My boss just bought a Land Cruiser (Limited) and I don't think it even compares.  Long trips, short trips, whatever the weather my Explorer handles it all.  Here in Colorado you never know what kind of weather to expect.  It doesn't matter, my baby handles it all.  In fact a couple of weeks ago it was snowing and the roads were bad.  The SUV in front of me was having problems.  Not me, I was casually flipping through the six cd's in my changer (by the way, the stock system in my Explorer is better than the custom system I had in my sport's car).<br><br>
