            I just graduated from college last May, and I had been saving money to replace my Ford Taurus station wagon when I set out to buy my first new car.  I was looking at all the small sedan models. I tried out the Focus and I loved it. I bought it that day.

I really love the compactness of this car, although the interior is large enough for my 6'1&quot; boyfriend. Its really sporty, and fun to drive. The only feature that is even a little annoying are the headrests, which can be hard to see around when changing lanes.  The ride is very smooth and quiet, and the radio booms (I like to crank up the bass).  The driver controls are handy and sleek.

Probably most importantly, I feel safe in this car. It doesn't feel like its made of plastic and is being blown around in the wind. I bought the car in January, in a bad Ohio winter, and felt very safe.

The financing even worked out well for me, with my first year salary.  

If you are young, or want to feel young again, you should be driving this car.<br><br>
