            Back in 1998 I decided to dump some stuff and get debt free. One of the things I had to part with was my nice, new sports car. I wanted to get something cheap, easy to fix, and reliable. I knew that Ford Explorers had a good track record, and I found one for a good price. Only one drawback...the 95,000 miles on the odometer. "What the heck!", I thought. It's just my get out of debt car. I'll dump it in a few years. Well, it's now 2002, and my Explorer has 150,000 miles on it. Not all of them have been trouble free, but most have. Of course I've put tires, brakes, belts, and hoses on 'er, but not much else. It developed a nice ping upon acceleration, and the dealer charged me $500 to fix that along with replacing some wear and tear stuff. The next stop was for a mass air flow sensor that was causing a loss of power. I also had them do an oil change, fuel filter swap, and some other small stuff. After 145,000 miles, I can't complain about that $600 repair. 

So far the old faithful Explorer has gotten me where I want to go and back like an old friend. It rides like a hay wagon (on bad shocks I'm sure), and doesn't get the greatest fuel mileage (about 20mpg), but I just can't see laying down $20,000+ for a new SUV when mine keeps on truckin'.

Would I buy another Explorer? Absolutely! The dealer has always had the parts in stock, and even my local Wal-Mart carries filters, wiper blades, etc. for it. Try that with some chic foreign sport-ute!

The 4.0 liter V-6 is a bit of a droaner, but I've beat the thing to death in the 4 years I've had it and she's never quit once. Never failed to start, never died on me. Who could ask for more than that in a paid for vehicle?
