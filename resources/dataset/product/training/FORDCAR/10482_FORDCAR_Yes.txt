            I own a 1993 Ford Ranger XLT 4x4 Regular cab pick up truck. This truck is awesome. It rides great and handles very well. This is an awesome off road vehicle. It goes right thru the mud with very little problems.

My husband and I bought this vehicle because we wanted a truck and my husband LOVES Ford products. He has converted me from a Chevy lover to a Ford lover.That was not a very hard thing to do.

From the first time I drove a Ford product I noticed the difference. The Ranger handles much better than the S-10. It has a smoother ride with better pick up. Also its a lot more comfortable than the S-10. Also with my first Ranger I only had to take it to the dealer one time for repairs and that was only a minor repair. Unlike my S-10 that lived at the dealer ship. I only had to take my Ranger in for regular service work (oil changes, tire rotation, ect.)

Anyone who wants a small truck that has the power of a big truck should look into purchasing a Ranger. Also its a very good truck that takes a licking and comes back for more. So if your hard on your trucks, buy a Ranger. They last forever!!! <br><br>
