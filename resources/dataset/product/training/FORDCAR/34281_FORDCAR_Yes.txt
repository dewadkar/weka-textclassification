            When we bought are F-150 we had bought it for the use of hauling stuff around and for looks. Well this turned out to be a truck maiinly for looks. Dont get me wrong that this truck does have plenty of room for loading and carry but the power seems to lack. The truck gets many looks for its sleek look and sport appearence. The truck seems to struggle a bit when it pulls our 20 foot boat up hills. The truck is over all a good truck for those with a family or just a single person. If you want a truck to take you places in style but if you want one for power look on to the F-250 maybe.<br><br>
