            I was approaching my 16th birthday and I didn't have a car to drive yet, so me and my dad sat down at the table and went over our options that we had at the time.  I needed something that I could beat on a little bit and that I wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time.  With not a ton of money in my savings account we decided that it may be a decent idea to go down to a DOT auction and see what they had to offer.  We found a lot of good deals on used DOT trucks with about 90k miles on them.  I finally found one that I didn't mind, and that wasn't too ugly of an orangeish color, and I purchased it for $2400.

After I got it home, I changed my mind about not minding the orange color, and decided that I would paint the outside of it a nice looking bronze color.  I didn't want to worry about the interior because that wasn't all that faded at the time.  After I finished the paint job, I was fairly pleased with the looks of it.  It wasn't ever anything fancy, but I wasn't ever really looking for it to be anything but a decent mode of transportation.

When I started driving it, there were 91k miles on the odometer, and by the time that I parted ways with the truck I had over 102k on it already.  I drove it for under a year and I was very happy to only have a few things go wrong with it.  I had to replace the starter and the ignition, other than that I didn't have any problems.  I half-way expected a few problems with it just because of the fact that it was an old used DOT truck that I'm sure the state workers didn't take the best care of, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.

It has a small straight 6 and that's more than you really need, anything more would just be guzzling down more gas than I would have liked.  I never really got that great of gas mileage out of it in the first place, usually only around 14 mpg.  I worked construction during the summer, so the long bed came in very handy for lots of different jobs around the site.  It had all rubber floor mats which was really great, because working construction, I tracked tons of mud inside the cab.  Cleaning it up took only a few minutes though.  It was as simple as running a hose through the cab and washing it all out.  I didn't experience any problems with rust or any sort of body defects and all in all it was a good, dependable truck.<br><br>
