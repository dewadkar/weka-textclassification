            All in all the van has proven to be dependable. Lots of little annoying things went wrong. The most serious was that the large sliding door quit opening. I have not had that fixed yet. Tape player quit working along with the remote radio panel. Bought the van in 96 and all these quit in 98. Power mirrors don't work now. AC fan went out last year. All these except for the large sliding door seem small. Front end hard to keep inline, but Arkansas roads seem to help that. Motor is still strong after 121,000 miles and mechanically I would not be scared to drive this van cross country. It would take alot to fix all the little things wrong to make this a real nice van again. Plan on trading soon.

No problem with motor or drivetrain.. Put starter on last year.<br><br>
