            The 99 Ford Ranger XLT-Sport is a great first truck because it is affordable and it comes with a lot of options.  It is not too small and not too big.  It is just perfect for a woman to drive.  It is very easy to get into with a skirt on and you don't hit your head trying to get out of it.  The sport addition comes with a painted bumper, fog lamps, aluminum hubcaps and a jazzy name on the side.  The other options include standard or automatic transmission, V6 or 4 cylinder engine, CD player or cassette player. 

This is my first truck, and I love it!  I always wanted a truck and have been looking around for one.  The reason is that it is easier to get in and out, it is also better to get around in the snow than cars.  I don't have to worry about not being able to get in my vehicle because there is a lot of snow in front of the door.  

I would strongly recommend this truck for anyone especially women because it is a good size to get around in and to park in small spaces,unlike a big truck that does not fit into too many tight places.
