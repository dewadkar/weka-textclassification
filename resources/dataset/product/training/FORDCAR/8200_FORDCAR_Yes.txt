            The new 2003 Expedition has a stylish and modern look that turns heads.  It has a tight turning radius and is very maneuverable in parking lots.  U-turns at traffic lights are a breeze.  Large 17" wheels give Expedition's driver very good height over the road.  If you don't want to be intimidated by other drivers, this is the ticket.  This is one hell-of-a stress reducer on Southern California roads and rat-race traffic.  Engine speed seldom exceeds 1500 RPM's.  Its full size cabin, large circumference wheels, and ultra-responsive drive train, make everyday driving, an unbeatable experience.

However, Freeway handling on this SUV is a HUGE disappointment.  The Expy corners well and does straight-aways well. But, steering is tenuous and difficult on gradual freeway curves.  Ford has a long way to go on their speed-sensitive rack & pinion. Unless you want to work like the devil to keep your Expedition from wandering out of its lane, and into another car, this SUV may not be for you. This is worth repeating. Freeway curves are a CHORE in the Expedition.

Compare the Expy with a GM SUV.  GM mechanical engineers designed a center steer "dead-spot" into their recirculating ball.  As a result, you can drive down the interstate with only one finger on the wheel. What a difference!  Other SUV's, like Explorer, are much easier to control on the freeway.

I gave the Expy a "one hand" steering test on gradual freeway curves.  If I gave a letter grade for this test, Expy would get a "C", Tahoe a "B", and Explorer, an "A".  Expy's Straight-away stability is very good.

Expedition's doors rattle on uneven pavement! The Expy has a very jarring and jolting ride over any bumps or uneven pavement.  By comparison, Tahoe has a soft cushy ride that soaks up the bumps.  However, while Tahoe doesn't "jolt", it does "whip" the passengers.  The Liftglass latching mechanism is poorly designed and not very reliable. Tilt steering, on all Ford's, is a chore! 

Power Seats are standard and longer than other makes, supporting long legs better.  But seats are NOT firmer. Adjustable lumbar is terrific.  Adjustable pedals are standard equipment and very nice.  GM power pedals work only when the vehicle is in Park.  Ford's power pedals are better.  Once you try power pedals, you can't live without 'em.

I have driven a total of 4 different 2003 5.4L 4x2 Expeditions. All were new. Ford puts a lot of research into safety enhancements and occupant crash protection.  Electronic Braking Distribution (EBD), on the Expy is an amazing feature. The Second gen airbags are something to be proud of.  And, The Expedition's Super Responsive drive train, does make for an unbeatable driving experience!



P.S.

To All Ford mechanical engineers reading this review:

Your SUV does not pass the "One Hand" steering test for freeway curves.  Kudo's to Ford on their SUPER RESPONSIVE drive train.
