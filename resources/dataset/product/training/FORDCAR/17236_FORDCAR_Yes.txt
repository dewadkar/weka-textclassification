            I bought this vehicle for the sole reason that it was not very expensive.  While this was basically the only reason, I was pleasantly surprised with it's performance.  The gas mileage is phenomenal, as the engine is quite small, and the car is very light.  It doesn't have power doors, windows, or steering, but I can live without it.  I now drive a 1995 Aspire, and I bought it for 2500 dollars.  The car is in perfect condition, and I have to fill it up maybe once every 2 weeks.  It's not a very powerful car, so for those of you who are looking for power, you should probably look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a dependable, affordable car, then this is the car you should consider.  I've had mine for a year so far, and I'm sure it'll last me a long, long time. <br><br>
