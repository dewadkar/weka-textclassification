              Hi my name is Walter. I have just purchased a brand new Ford F150 Supercab pick-up truck. I bought this vehicle for several reasons. The main one being that I can haul things in it that I can not with my car. It is very roomy in the back seat. Anytime you buy a car or truck I recommend that you check the back seat out first. You would be surprised how uncomfortable back seats can be. My teenage son is over six feet tall and can sit in the back seat comfortably.My truck has a V-6 engine in it and has plenty of get up and go for loads and my family. It can sit 6 people, has drink holders in the front and back seats, has a great stereo ( nothing fancy ), a fold down center piece which is great for resting your arms on when driving or riding. The AC will freeze you. I got a 36,000 mile warranty, which is standard. It is an automatic and has overdrive. Mine is an upgraded version with two tone paint,aluminum wheels, and all terrane tires I could go on and on about this truck but the bottom line is that it now has 10,000 miles on it and has not given me any trouble at all. This is the fourth F-150 truck I have owned over the last 20 years and have been very happy with all of them. I paid $19,300 dollars for this truck and used the internet to find out that this was a good deal. Trust the prices on the net, for the most part they are correct as long as you don't go to the manufacturers site. Do your shopping because a lot of car dealers will really sock it to you on the price of these trucks, and I would never pay over $20,000 for one unless it was really, really decked out. Its a great family vehicle, a great work vehicle, and I would highly recommend this truck to anyone.             Sincerely,   Walter Cross  <br><br>
