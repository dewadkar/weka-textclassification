            The 1998 old's LSS is a very good car.  It is very roomy, has more than adequate power and is comfortable to drive.  However, It is not perfect.

I purchased this car to replace my olds 98 regency which they stopped manufacturing.  It has served well in this capacity and it is quite enjoyable to ride. 

Some of its best features are the 1 gallon washer fluid reservoir and the traction control

On the bad side It has a very poorly designed trunk lid that drips into the trunk if you open it after it rains. The radio balance controls need improvement. and the steering wheel mounted volume control needs a finer adjustment.  The leather seats are not very durable and need more adjustment of the angle between the back and bottom of the driver seat.


Overall this is a very good car for the money however with A few improvements it could be a great car.<br><br>
