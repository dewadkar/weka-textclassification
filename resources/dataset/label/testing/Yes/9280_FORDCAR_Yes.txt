            After driving my family's 1988 Ford Taurus (in the later years without A/C, in Houston!) through college, it was time to get a new car.  I considered the Contour, the Honda Civic, the VW Jetta, and the Nissan Altima.  I wanted a smaller-sized car and those fit into my price range, and I had heard good things about all of them.

<b>Advantages</b>
I have to admit, the Contour was the lowest on my list when I started, so I considered it last.  To me, the Contour isn't the most attractive car out there, and to me it just screamed &quot;boring!&quot; (or rather, mumbled it) which was not exactly what I wanted to be looking for.  Boy was I wrong!  The first time I drove one, I was blown away by its performance, especially compared to the Altima and the Civic.  I read another review that said the driver kept thinking about how slow everyone on the road was travelling compared to her.  I had the exact same experience - I looked down and I was going 85 and hadn't even noticed.

The suspension is great - I fly over some horrible railroad tracks every day and the ride is pretty smooth.  Surprisingly (at least in my car) wind noise is not too noticeable unless I'm going over 80 or so.  Acceleration is great (it is a V6 though, I wouldn't recommend the 4-cylinder model to anyone who is looking for a fun ride), and the brakes (4-wheel disc with the SE Sport package) are very responsive.  

When it came down to price, the Contour turned out to be the cheapest option for me.  I managed to get a new 99 Contour, complete with the SE Sport Package for $13,800.  No mistake!  I used an internet shopping service and my dealer called me the next day with that offer.  That did include a $750 rebate and 2.9% financing, as well as a $400 first-time buyer rebate.

<b>Drawbacks</b>
If you frequently take long trips with more than one adult-sized passenger, you might be better off with a different car.  It seems like the engineers at Ford have tried their best to make space in the back - I've ridden back there and it's comfortable enough for short trips, but I doubt it would be for long ones.  Fuel economy with the V6 is not too great in the city (20 mpg) but it's almost 30mpg on the highway.  Attractiveness - this is subjective but I think that without the sport package, this is a very plain-looking car.  The sport package really improves its looks though.  Note:  with the arrival of the Ford Focus, the Contour base models have been eliminated from production.  The SE Sport package is standard on all new 2000 Contours.  This would include the V6 engine, 4-wheel disc brakes, fog lamps, spoiler, alloy wheels, etc.

I've read that other people have had problems with frequent repairs - this has not been my experience.  I had to take it in when I first bought it because the A/C pumped warm air.  It turned out to be a very minor repair.  Since then (almost one year) I have had no problems.  My car didn't come with a split/folding rear seat, but I think on 2000 Contours this is standard.

<b>Recommendation</b>
I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a European-style driving experience without the European-style price tag.  It's a great first car, and would also make a great second car for a couple.  I wouldn't recommend it for families with small kids or very big kids - it's difficult to reach from the front to the back seat, and teens might not be comfortable with the leg room in the back.

<b>Update 4/7/00</b>
It's been brought to my attention that I should be concerned about the number of recalls that have been issued for the Contour.  Since I purchased my car in the summer of 1999, there have been <b>no</b> safety recalls for the 99 Contour (and as far as I'm aware, no service bulletins).  Either Ford finally got all the kinks out or I've just been lucky.  If you are contemplating the purchase of an older Contour, the recall factor may be something you should consider.<br><br>
