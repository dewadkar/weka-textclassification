            I purchased my Ford Explorer in 1991.  It was probably the most rugged vehicle I may ever own.  The large amount of cargo space was great and I loved being able to sit up higher in the driver's seat than most of the other cars around me.  The only problem is that I bought the Explorer during the first year that the model was issued.

The most notable problem with the early Explorers is the wheel alignment and balance.  The design of the early Explorer, for some reason, always ended up putting all four tires out of alignment.  By the time the vehicle was a few years old, I had to have the tires re-aligned and balanced every time I took it in for servicing.  And I don't want to take the time to mention all of the recalls that were issued on the 1991 Ford Explorer (from the rear bumper to the brakes).  The most critical issue regarding the wheel alignment problem is that it tended to cause the wheels to 'cup', that is, roll on their edges as opposed to flat.  This forced me to replace all four tires twice during the life of the vehicle (I traded it in at 104,000 miles).

Around the fifth or sixth year after I bought the Explorer the ball bearings in the gear box for the 4x4 capability began to go bad.  I finally was forced off the road one day when my front right tire locked up and the vehicle started to veer onto the shoulder.  Fortunately I had just accelerated out of a driveway and was able to pull into another.  At that point I just disconnected the gear box and promptly drove to a dealership to get a new car (disconnecting the gear box cost me about $1,000 in trade in value).

The problems I just related to you could probably be confirmed at any auto service shop.  I heartily recommend that if you like the Explorer, go ahead and get one, but just make sure that all of these issues have been resolved and that you don't get stuck having to deal with these problems yourself.
