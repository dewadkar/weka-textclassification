            I had a Chevy S-10 pickup which I bought new in 1991 and sold in 1995, putting on 64,000 miles along the way.  With the exception of a cracked distributor cap at about 40,000, I had no problems whatsoever with this truck, and only sold it because of the arrival of my daughter, and the discomfort of squeezing a childseat and two adults onto the bench seat of a compact pickup with a manual  transmission.  Of course when I bought the truck, I was single and in the army, for which purpose this truck, while far less sophisticated than a Nissan or Toyota, did a great job.

My 1991 S-10 was white, with a gray vinyl seat, a 5-speed manual transmission, no air conditioning and no stereo.  In fact, the there were absolutely NO OPTIONS on my truck.  It cost me $10,000 brand-new, and for that price was an excellent value.  Toyotas were at least $2,000 more, and while much more refined, powerful and better looking (in my opinion), I doubt I would have gotten any better service out of it.

What I liked most about the S-10 at the time was the driver seat.  Yes, it was a flat, plain-looking vinyl bench, but it also had excellent support for thights, lower and upper back and every other part of my anatomy.  I've sat in many cars, and some of them were more comfortable than the S-10, but NOT ONE of them was more comfortable in 1991.  The seat was actually better than the one in my father's 1988 Honda Accord, which is saying a lot.

The interior was as simple as they come, with exposed metal at the tops of the doors, partial plastic door trim, a hard plastic dash with cheap-looking instruments that but for the lack of a tachometer, were very complete, and a rubber mat instead of carpetting.  You could clean this interior with a garden hose, which I did once or twice after taking the truck camping.

I also had the standard cab, which meant no recline on the driver's seat.  This didn't bother me as I found the driving position to be as close to perfect as I could want.  Even the steering wheel (non-tilt) was at just the right angle and distance for long haul driving comfort.

Long haul comfort in a 2.5 liter, 4 cylinder S-10 without AC?  Oh yeah.  I drove this truck cross-country and it was ONLY the lack of air conditioning that kept this from being the most comfortable vehicle I've ever made this trip in.  With the windows closed and the tranny in 5th (overdrive), the engine was quiet and smooth at 75 or 80mph, the suspension did a terrific job of soaking up pavement problems while at the same time giving agile handling that I never thought possible from a pickup truck (I had upgraded to 215/60/15 Goodyear Eagles and put a special 200lb lead mat on the bed floor which greatly improved handling and comfort).  Even unloaded and with the stock tires the truck was smooth and comfortable on most roads, but I didn't get to drive it in this condition for long as my truck was vandalized just two weeks after I bought, with some punk slashing all four of my sidewalls, as well as those of every other car in the lot where I was parked.

The 2.5 liter engine was something the automotive press complained about in every car and truck in which it appeared (remember the Fiero?  Same engine).  The engine was, to put it mildly, gutless.  Sure it made a claimed 100HP or thereabouts, and the truck was not at all underpowered, but the engine just did not like to rev.  This engine really didn't belong in a sporty car like the Fiero, but in the S-10 I had no problem with it.  I actually drag-raced my friend in his 1994 Saturn SL and my truck was faster, it just wasn't fun going fast in it.  It made harsh noises and ghasped and weezed for air when pushed.  0-60 was just a tick under 11 seconds, which isn't bad for a four cylinder pickup in 1991, and the truck would cruise at 80+ all day long.

Another area of the engine's behavior that was inadequate was the cooling system.  I didn't buy the optional towing package (V6) or the upgraded cooling system option for the four.  In stock onfiguration, my truck would overheat when I climbed the long, uphill "Grapevine" of I-5 Northbound leaving Los Angeles.  Of course, I was young and foolish and tried to push this little truck to take that incline at 75MPH loaded with stuff in the bed.  At 65 it would do fine, but the truck was so smooth and since I lacked cruise control, my speed would always creep up to 75 and then the temperature gage would start climbing.  The "heavy duty" cooling system should have been standard, as any modern truck, properly maintained, shouldn't overheat when climbing mountains with the AC off, or in my case, absent.

The steering (no power here) was a bit heavy at slow speeds, but not bad once rolling.  Once past the effort, however, the steering had excellent feel of what the tires were doing (recirculating ball mechanisms are NOT inferior to rack and pinion, just different, go ask Mercedes) while filtering out any harshness from the road surface.  THe cluth pedal, on the other hand, was just plain heavy, and in Los Angeles traffic, got old fast.  The clutch itself was very sturdy, still feeling new at trade-in time, just was very tiring to use in traffic.

My favorite aspect of the truck's feel, believe it or not, was the 5-speed transmission.  The lever was long, as it is in most truck, but really had a precise feel going into the gates.  It was direct, and oh so mechanical, feeling much better than any other manual shifter I've ever owned, and I've owned quite a few of them.  While the engine forced early and frequent shifting, the feel of the lever made those shifts pure automotive bliss for me.

A friend at work has a 1990 S10 which is essentially identical to the one I used to have, only with a much plusher interior (cloth seat, automatic, AC) andfar more miles (134,000).  We recently went to lunch and he let me drive his truck back to the office, which taking 110 South from Pasadena is actually a fun place to drive with curves that always put a smile on my face when there isn't heavy traffic.  His S10 felt just as tight as mine had, despite the years and the miles (he maintains his vehicles religiously), and I actually missed my old white S-10.

Of course such a truck makes no sense for me today, with a family, but little "stuff" to lug around.  Still, that S-10 was a truck that I can honestly say I enjoyed owning, and but for the baby, would have kept far longer than I did.  Were I shopping for a used one today, I'd go straight to the stripper model (though with AC) and a stick shift.  Just thinking about my old S-10 makes me want to take a road trip.
