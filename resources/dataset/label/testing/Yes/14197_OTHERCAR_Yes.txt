                 After purchasing a '00 Mirage that turned out to be a lemon, I was hesitant to buy a second Mitsubishi (especially after dealing with the regional manager for the company who gave me nothing but headaches).  On the way out from getting my refund check I saw the Lancer sitting out on the lot and was intrigued.  When I saw the shadow gray O.Z. Rally I had to drive it.
     I had test driven the Civic (to great disappointment), the Corolla, and a Celica (likewise, great disappointments) and was running out of ideas.  Hopping behind the wheel of the Lancer is a pleasure.  I must emphasize that the O.Z. is the best of the three models however. I felt like the wood grain interior of the other models made them feel like cheap Buicks.  Placing automatic transmission in this car should be a crime.  There is absolutely no power in the automatic.
     Many car reviewers have attacked the Lancer for no obvious reason.  This car is heads above anything else in its class.  It handles and looks better than the Civic and keeps up on power provided it has a manual transmission.  I won't even mention the Corolla which has nothing going for it other than the much hyped Toyota reliability.  Some reviewers have complained about the interior.  All I can say is, what are you looking at?  The O.Z. interior is classy, well refined, and easily accessible.  On top of that it is downright stylish.  The red background lights on the gauges add a touch of flash over the boring green lights on most cars.  Critics have also slammed it for not coming with side airbags or ABS brakes.  I say, so what?  Until a few years ago no one had even heard of side airbags and the Lancer has performed well in safety tests despite not having them.  As for ABS brakes, they are nice to have but are not a necessity.  I drove a rear wheel drive Thunderbird for six years in Cincinnati weather without an accident.  
     The simple fact is that this a fun car to drive.  I'm 6'1" and have plenty of room in the front seats.  The back is less spacious but still comfortable for relatively short trips.  If you're looking for a family sedan this may not be the car for you, but for a sporty and fun vehicle to kick around in, this is it.  
     I feel I should also say something about the handling in this car.  This is a car that can easily hug every curb.  It is light and responsive and the stabilizers and suspension hang right in.  The ride is remarkably smooth on almost any surface.  I haven't been in any car that can take a turn better.
