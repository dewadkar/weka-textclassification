<TEXT>
            I currently own a 1986 Mazda 626.....I hate to say it BUT I sleep in this
car every nite. You might say it is keeping me alive right now!! I like
the 626.....especially the Stick-Shift 5 speed model due to the POWER
it has....especially around curves and up hills. Sadly enough I am NOT
happy that my blower is dying on me.....that is a problem right now.
Also....the hand-brake is not the best in the world. With the older
models like this one....you can get LEAKS in the trunk around the side pocket area....so BE CAREFUL!! I think most people should seriously
CONSIDER buying a used car like this....while they have their troubles..
they are VERY RELIABLE zippy little cars....and the engine always seems
TO GO on demand!! I bought the car to sleep in....But I will keep it
if I can....ALOHA from HILO HAWAII....Stephen.....<br><br>
