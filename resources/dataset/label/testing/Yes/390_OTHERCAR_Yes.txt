            I have my Xterra for six months and would highly recommend it, my last three vehicles were two chevy blazers and one jeep cherokee, they were fine SUV's but they had nothing over my Xterra, the on road handling feels solid and gives you a sense of confidence, but what sold me on this car was the leg room, with my seat all the way back there is still plenty of rear seat passenger leg room, this was important to me. One feature I don't like on the car is there seats are not comfortable for long distance trips. The overall cargo space and leg room is what sold me on the car, the price was another eye catcher to i felt in comparison to other it was a great deal. It's a 4x2 wheel drive makes it an ideal highway vehicle so if your looking for off road this would not  be the choice for those, who need that from there sport utility vehicle, thou it still has plenty of ground clearance.<br><br>
