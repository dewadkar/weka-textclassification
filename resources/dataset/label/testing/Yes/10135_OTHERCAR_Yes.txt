            The Nissan Pathfinder could be one of the most under-appreciated SUVs on the market.  With that thought in mind I found a GREAT deal on a 2000 Pathfinder LE with cloth interior.  Because the deal was solid enough I settled for the LE, otherwise I would recommend finding an SE that also comes with the exterior fog lights and sunroof etc...  But on the other hand, a set of aftermarket PIAA high intensity fog or driving lights blow away anything stock.  If after market fog or driving lights are a definite addition on your vehicle, CHECK THEM OUT!

Similar vehicles I drove against the Pathfinder were the Ford Explorer and the Nissan Xterra.  In my opinion, the Pathfinder does everything the Explorer does (with the exception of newly added 3rd row seating on the Explorer) but better, except in one case: the engine (more on that later).  I have owned and driven two Explorers and they are typical of Ford engineering: conservative.  Great vehicles, but nevertheless Ford tends to go "middle-of-the-road" in the design process.  The fit and finish was on par with the Pathfinder, though.  The Xterra is nice, but small.  You must see how small the rear cargo area is to believe it and I believe that it is too small to make traveling for a family of 4 practical.  I was actually disappointed at its cramped quarters and relieved when my wife felt the same way.  Sure if you and your Amazonian girlfriend go mountainbiking or rock-climbing but never go on a week-long road trip,the smaller Xterra might be adequate.  Otherwise, think bigger, think Pathfinder...

The Pathfinder seats 5 comfortably and leaves plenty of room for luggage and other storage in the rear cargo area.  The Pathfinder drives very much like a car and of all the SUVs I have driven, this is definitely the most easy to warm up to.  There are no surprises for the driver whether it be the brakes, suspension, or controls.  But most importantly, I feel safer when my wife drives this SUV.  Because it is so easy to drive and is not simply a variation on a pickup chassis, I feel better knowing she feels safe and comfortable driving it, and she was AFRAID of my Explorer.  Again, chalk one up for Nissan in the intangible department...  Again, the interior is well thought out and the seats are quite comfortable yet firm with durable fabric.  The seats fold down to give cargo room all the way from the tailgate to the front seats when needed.  Although the suspension and ride are quite forgiving, make no mistake: this vehicle is rock-solid.  Nothing rattles or squeaks, anywhere after 37,000 miles...

So what's not to like?  Ironically, the Pathfinder boasts a 240 HP V-6 engine that seems almost anemic.  I don't know if it is an attempt at reducing engine noise or some other engineering scheme, but this thing is definitely not a tire-scorcher (but remember who is driving this vehicle).  Such a shame for the Pathfinder considering the numbers.  Could the dyno have been wrong?  I still scratch my head over this one... The only nit picky comment I have is that the switch to enable the cruise control is located on the left side of the dash, almost hidden from view.  I guess I'm used to all the controls being on the steering wheel.  Nissan put 3 of the 4 controls for cruise control on the steering wheel so I guess I shouldn't complain...  I found the driver's cockpit a bit cramped, but only on longer drives 3 or 4 hours or more.  In the big picture, the Pathfinder leaves little to complain about.  

Overall, the Pathfinder provides a very solid vehicle both inside and out, and rides and drives as the best SUV in its class in my opinion.  For the driver who is NOT an enthusiast that has to have the fastest, biggest or most elaborate SUV, this is an SUV that will charm you.  It's subtlety is its biggest strength.  In fact, it does so much well, you might even say it can be boring to drive at times (see the enthusiast statement above...that's me!)  But if you are looking for an SUV to own and hold on to for a LONG time, there are none that will be a better value over time.
