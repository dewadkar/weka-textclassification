            The 1992 Paseo my girlfriend owns is a small car, but it runs very smooth.  It is a dependable car.  Although there is not a lot of room in the rear, it makes up for it in the front.  It's definitely not a travel vehicle for more than two.  

She has had very little trouble from it.  It has survived two wrecks and the engine still has that low hum of reliability.  Standing at about 6'2&quot;, 235 lbs, it's not a car that I would personally have.  But for someone smaller it is a definite recommendation.  It gets relatively good gas mileage and has nice handling in rough weather.  So if you're looking for a good, dependable car, you can't go wrong with a Paseo.  Just watch your knees!<br><br>
