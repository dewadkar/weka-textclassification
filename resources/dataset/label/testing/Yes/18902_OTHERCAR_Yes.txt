            I got a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo because I needed four wheel drive. The area I live in gets large amounts of snow in the winter, and a SUV was the obvious and utilitarian choice. I have had it for a number of years now, and it has really been a good vehicle. Recently the air conditioning broke, but overall over the years it has been very reliable. It is a little slow to accelerate, but has the power it needs to get where you need to go. Four wheel drive can be a big help in an area of extreme weather, and the Jeep has proven it can handle the snow. It is also very comfortable, and we have taken it on many long trips. It is a fun car to drive, too. I would recommend this car to anyone who needs a car that can handle the weather and while still being comfortable. <br><br>
