            Ok, to understand this car is to understand it's targeted market.  The person who is interested in a LEXUS SUV will be looking for a status symbol that is comfortable and yet somewhat capable in tricky weather.  The fact that this vehicle has scored high in safety crash tests doesn't hurt either.  The intentions of this vehicle are clearly observed when driving this vehicle.  It offers a commanding view of the road while you sit in one of the most comfortable interiors offered in a sub-$50,000 vehicle.  The steering is extremely light(which is characteristic Lexus and that i have never cared for really) but accurate and the four wheel drive is only for wet or snowy weather.  This vehicle distributes its power to the front wheels in normal driving and sends power rearward when the front wheels slip.  Any buyer looking for an off-road excursion should look at a Jeep, but this vehicle is even more unsuited than most SUV's.  The chassis is based on the Camry(which is also the platform for the ES300, Solara, etc.), and it is obvious when you lift the hood.  The engine appears low in the bay and the higher fenders of the SUV body amplify the effect.  Having driven an Grand Cherokee for a number of years, i will say that the lower center of gravify of the Lexus brings more confidence, but nothing like my BMW sedan.  
  The complaints about this vehicle include the smallish rear space compartment and the general styling.  While the cargo space is not overwhelming, the seats can be folded down and it holds a great deal of stuff.  Personally, i've moved a computer, stereo, clothes, bookcases, chairs, refrigerator, and other miscellaneous things to and from college.  The styling is of course a personal decision, and i admit to not liking this vehicle initially because of it.  But it grows on you and i appreciate not seeing the same vehicle( Cherokee, Explorer, Expedition, Blazer, etc) on every street corner.
  As for the other &quot;premium brand&quot; SUVs, i will say that the QX4, while a nicely equiped vehicle, was not my preference, despite the power advantage and the cost differences.  The QX4 looks disproportionate in my eyes( again, a personal choice).  The 240hp is nice, but the weight of the truck(and in this case, it REALLY is a truck underneath) and the vague steering did not appeal to me.  And don't be fooled, the Lexus GOES when you want it to.  Also the fuel economy of this Lexus was also a deciding factor.  The new Acura MDX looks nice on paper, and the seating for seven is a nice touch, but the Odyssey underpinnings would require a thorough test before i would consider the change.  The Mercedes has reliability issues, as it is made in Alabama and this one vehicle has dropped Mercedes out of the top ten of the JD Power rankings.  The BMW is nice, but the rough ride is a personal choice, the luxury isn't up the Lexus standard, and the V6 isn't available yet.
  As to offer you, the reader, with all options, i would like you to consider the all-wheel drive wagons from Germany.  Not the ML or the X5, but the CARS.  They get better fuel economy, perform better, carry just as much, and drive BEAUTIFULLY.  
  If you're looking for a SUV with high status, somewhat exclusive looks, exceptional comfort and a vehicle that you know will be running beautifully ten years from now, this vehicle deserves your consideration.
  Remember though, that this is essentially a car, not for towing or off-roading.<br><br>
