            Well we recently bought this car used. Before we had it it was owned by a rental car company so it was in almost new condition. I love this car. When I first started looking at them I thought they were going to be to small. I mean I was use to driving a 95 Grand Am. Plus it has to be big enough to hold me, my fiance, and my son in a car seat. Well my fiance and I aren't small people so we needed room. I was really concerned about that. Once I got into the car I realized that there is more room in there than what it looks like. My fiance is 6'2 and I am 5'10 and we both have plently of room. I sat in the back seat with my son and had enough room, not as much as I would like but it was enough. That didn't really bother me much since I would be driving it most of the time.  
 I was also looking for something good on gas and I have got to say that this car is GREAT on gas and I am always driving. I fill her up on Monday and it lasts till the next Monday and that is with me driving all day long. 
 When I first looked into the car and saw how thin the seats were I thought they were going to be VERY uncomfortable but boy was I wrong. They aren't as comfortable as my mothers explorer seats that heat up but they worked for me. 
 For the past few years I have been driving a stick shift so I was more than happy to see how affordable the automatic was. LOL it is a lot easier to reach back and give my son his battle without having to change gears.  I am also surprised with it only being a four cylinder how it picks up and goes. I have to say that I love that! It doesn't pick up and go like a six but for a four it does great! I have driven both four and six and this is the best four cylinder I have ever driven. 
 It is also VERY quiet and smooth. I will roll down my window to smoke a cig and can't believe the difference in noise! It is also one of the smoothest riding cars I have ever been in. I have to go over speed bumps everday and for once my head doesn't hit the ceiling. I have also noticed my son doesn't bob around as much.
 Overall I am VERY happy with my new to me car purchase. It was a great price at $9500.00 with only 13,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier with it!
