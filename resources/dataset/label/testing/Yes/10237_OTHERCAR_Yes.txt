            I debated between the Mercedes ML320 and the Lexus RX300.  Safety was a foremost concern and the ability to tow a boat.  I test drove both vehicles and found that they each handled well and the ride was excellent in both.  Safety-wise I have heard that the Mercedes is #1 and the Lexus #2.  Both vehicles offer front and side airbags.  Below are the differences that I found.

The Mercedes has a child seat that can be disabled only if you buy a Mercedes car seat.  This seemed to be a limited benefit.  Also the Mercedes did not have a temperature control setting and it did not have vents for the back seat passengers.  I find these to be important features on long trips.

The color of the tan interior on the Mercedes looks almost flesh color once you are inside the vehicle.  I thought I would like it a lot more than I did.  This narrowed my possible color choices that I would be happy with.  For such an expensive purchase, I wanted to be totally happy with the vehicle.  I gravitated back towards the Lexus.  

I love the placement of things on the inside and little things like the programmable buttons for garage door openers.  You can even save the seat settings for two different drivers.  It rides beautifully and I have already taken it on several long trips including down to Key West.  We have pulled the boat with it and don't even notice that it is back there.  It is wonderful!!  The back seats can recline and there is plenty of room in the back.  Overall, I find the look and lines of the Lexus more eye pleasing.
