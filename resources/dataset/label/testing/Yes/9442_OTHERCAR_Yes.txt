            I have a 97 model in Royal Blue with Parchment hide. It is unlike any other car in the World. The Azure is faster and smoother than most cars and has performance to match a lot of super cars. The main thing that is different is the amazing Torque, this allows you to drive around all day without any discernable gear changes, when you want to accelerate the car just smoothly gathers pace and the in gear times beat most sports cars. Bear in mind we are talking about a vehicle with twice the Torque of a 550 Ferrari. It is true effortless speed with the smoothness of any luxury sedan. The interior is faultless and where ever you park people look less at the body but they all peer inside to see the leather and 
wood handmade dash.

As you sit in the hand made heated sets you set the split level climate control to automatic and drive. Electric motors take care of every adjustment you need to make to get comfortable. Everything can be set with memory so you just sit down, click the memory recall and all the preset controls glide into place to fit your driving style. I have driven 600 miles without fatigue in one go with only a stop for petrol at speeds of up to 140 mph. I wanted to carry on driving afterwards when I reached my destination. It was TRULY ENJOYABLE. There are not many cars you can say the same thing about. I've had Mercs, Lexus's ( I have a SC400 still), but they are devoid of feeling. This car makes you want to sit in it and drive it because it is so good to travel any where surrounded by total luxury. Everything is just so good, the 30Watt Alpine Stereo with CD, The Engine with its V8 burble on acceleration but silence any other time, the effortless speed, the smooth drive train, the fully automatic hood, the interior comfort like your most comfortable chair at home - these things as a whole package together make the car unique.

The suspension adapts as you drive and is smooth around town and hard on the motorway. There is little scuttle shake or wind noise except over 120mph with the roof up. There is loads of space inside for 4 so the car can be used everyday instead of a sedan or sports car but when the sky is blue you have the best convertible in the World. Are you ready to buy one yet?

Reliability is not a problem if you have the thing serviced regularly with an expert. The engines do 500,000 miles without bother and there are many early Turbo Rs with high mileages which have basically the same engine although less powerful, and these still run around as daily drivers. All the controls are very well built so last without problem. If anything problems occur with under use when some of the many motors can seize. Use the car every week and it all works.

Costs are high - mileage is 15 or less to the gallon. Servicing is probably more expensive than any other car on the market and has to be done at least once a year or 6000 miles. No dealer service history = no value when you come to re-sell.

The Azure is a true dream car. It is not necessarily a rich man's toy but you need to have the funds to run it properly or it will let you down and you have wasted your money. There is nothing that gets as many admiring looks. In London where my Azure lives it commands respect rather than the envy of a Porsche or Aston Martin. No problem getting out at junctions which cannot be said when I'm in a big Merc.

I think its a unique vehicle amongst the mass produced dross which populates our roads. I love my Azure to bits.
