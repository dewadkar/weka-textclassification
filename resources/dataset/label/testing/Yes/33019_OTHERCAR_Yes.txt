                 I recently purchased a GMC Sierra 1500 SL.  I think I may be in love.  It came equipped with a POWERFUL V6 Vortec engine that comes alive under the 5-speed manual transmission.  I have never driven a mid-sized truck with this kind of power with no alterations.  Simply amazing.
     As a construction superintendent, a truck is more or less a necessity.  This particular truck makes working less of a doldrum and more of a pleasure.  Don't get me wrong, here...  I would much rather be sitting at home with a beer in hand than here at work, but getting to drive around in my new truck makes that pain subside nicely...
     With the windows rolled up and the stereo off, you would think you were riding in a limo.  There is virtually no engine noise, and the wind noise is all but non-existant.  The seats are comfortable, even for me.  (I am 6'5&quot; tall and darn near 300 lbs.  Kind of hard to find a car that I fit in...)  For you yuppies who want something with power to show off to you friends, but not one of those simple-minded SUVs, think about a big, rugged, American GMC Sierra.  I think I am in love...<br><br>
