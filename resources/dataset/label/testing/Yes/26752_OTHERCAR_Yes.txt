            This is an excellent camera for people who want something to play with and don't necessarily know much about photography but want nice pictures.

I'm not going to go into the details of what this camera can do and what your pictures might look like but here are the pictures I've taken in the last week &lt;a href= http://polarbear.andrew.cmu.edu/tmartin &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

Another nice thing about this camera is that I can download the pictures to my Linux computer which is important since I don't have easy access to (or desire to use) any windows or mac computers. 

Like any digital camera there are the gotchas that batteries don't last long and storage can be limited on a long trip. Decide first if you really want a digital camera before you start comparing features.<br><br>
