            I bought this truck(yes, truck) because I could pay cash for it since I bought it used, and I wanted something a little different. Yes, I have to explain that it was built by Ford and is like the explorer's red-headed stepchild, but I love it just the same.
Mine is blue, and since Mazda only made them for 4 years, it's a little hard to find Mazda specific parts.
It is great fun to drive, you sit up higher than in a car, and recently I had to go through the firestone re-call from hell, but I have new tires now so I suppose it'll be worth it in the long run. I didn't know when i bought it that this was the truck I'd been waiting all my life for, but I hope I never have to drive anything else.
Don't buy this car if you want something that is easy to find parts for, but if you want something a little different, than this is the truck for you!<br><br>
