Caveat: I didn't even ask the dealer for a quote on what I tested as it had nothing but V6 and manual tranny.

Preface; I need to get a new car soon for a variety of reasons. I'm in love with the WRX, but the insurance rates are the figurative mother-in-law from heck. 

In search of another car that "does it" for me while staying under 25K, I test drove a Mazda 6s (V6, 5-speed manual) and was well impressed with how it felt on the road; we went a ~10 mile loop on some pretty nasty NJ roads (for those who know, south on the 202 in Flemington, north up some back-woods road a few miles, and back down 202) The car felt solid and composed. 

Steering felt a bit heavy at walking speeds, but got nice at highway speed. 

The clutch pedal's travel was a bit short, so I had a couple of inadvertent jackrabbit starts, but once it gets rolling it feels fast and sharp. 

Of all things about a car, I feel least certain about judging how a manual tranny shifts (odd since I've only ever driven manual!) But I agree with what I've read in magazines; shifter was a bit clicky/notchy, but those things always feel like that brand-new. I didn't want to hammer it because I think that's a good way to convince a dealer not to treat you squarely, but the few times I did a rolling start (e.g. coasting up to a light in 1st and it turns green) shift action was acceptable and I never felt unsure of what gear I was going into or feared I was going to miss a shift (not bad for a totally strange car; heck, if I change from my Neon to my sister's I usually muff one shift while I'm getting adjusted!). Plus it was nice being able to cruise at 55mph in 4th gear, with the engine turning LESS than 3000 RPM!! (that's my Neon heritage there)

Industry magazines say it handles very well but isn't as fast (0-60 in 8 flat) as it feels. Felt pretty fast to me; maybe I'm the opposite of spoiled or something. 

Like its looks, even though the Sport package (bigger wheels, high-intensite fog lights, dual exhaust) forces the driver to accept a silly trunk wing. I'd consider skipping the Sport package except I like the lower-body trim that comes as part of the package. That trim is available in the Appearance package, but that is MORE expensive than the Sport group and is JUST the aero trim. Go figure! (more on this later)

Interior is definitely a notch (or 3) above the WRX, with soft/smooth/warm/fuzzy stuff everywhere and a very "hush hush" feeling.

However, I wasn't as impressed with how "busy" the Mazda's centre stack is. It had big, easy-to-turn, buttons and solid switches that went "snick" rather than "click" but they were all spaced so far apart that you can't simply memorize the "row-order" and do stuff by touch. Added to that is the radio/climatronic (all models are standard with climate-control, very nice!) display which is at the top of the centre stack, meaning you can't flick your hand/eye coordination to one spot, see the radio settings, change them, and then get 100% back on the road. It had controls on the steering wheel, but they looked a bit crowded, but those would probably become second nature after time. 

A big hit on the 6, at least when it comes to simply buying one, is that it's brand new and getting one with an unusual options group will be tough (like the GTI VR6 6spd, which is nigh-impossible to find without leather). The dealer had 2 on-lot, both without the Sport package. One w/ the Sport setup was inbound, but it also had leather and the cold-weather group which I don't want (IMHO, leather in cars costing less than $25K usually feels a bit rough and ages quickly) 

The guy I spoke with said they have 8 more allocated to them between now and end of March, but doesn't yet know what options are on them. 

I acknowledge that the first few years of Ford-majority-ownership weren't very kind to Mazda, and some modles in the late 90s slipped a notch or two from where they were before then. But Protege and MPV always got high marks, Ford's engines/technology constantly receive high praise, Mazda seems to be hitting some solid shots (altho I think the new RX8 is UHgly) and maybe they'll turn it around. If I could get a match (or even 2 bars and a cherry) on the Mazda6 options slot-machine I think I'll go along for the ride.

The trunk is quite large for a vehicle this size, with a wide, low, straight edge on the loading edge. The trunk hatch opens to almost perpendicular with the car, and is support with gas struts instead of gooseneck hinges so there's nothing to mangle groceries. Of note are pull-handles on either side of the trunk opening; pulling one causes that side's rear seat half to unlatch and fold down almost all the way. Quite better than discovering what you're loading won't fit and having to open the rear doors to fold the seat.

The car was very quiet IMHO, but I don't have a deep experience with car quietness. I didn't have the radio on at all, but the climate-control was working in the background and the fan noise never intruded on the cabin silence.

I didn't back the car up so my judgment of rearward visibility is limited, but the outside mirrors gave good coverage. The low, short hood made it easy to "place" the car's front corners, and I suspect parallel parking will be easy despite the aforementioned heavy steering at less than 5mph.

I've begun polling dealers for prices on my chosen setup, and am being told that I can either wait through the options lottery or special order and wait 6-8 weeks. I'll begin trying dealers near my hometown this week.
