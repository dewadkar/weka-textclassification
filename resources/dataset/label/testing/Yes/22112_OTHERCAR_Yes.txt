            This camera is the wave of the future. It can take 14 high quality pictures and around 100 lower quality ones. It has two times optical zoom that produces crisp close-up shots. The camera has a two inch lcd screen on the back that can be used to line up shots. After each shot is taken, the picture appears on this screen and you have the option to delete it then and save room for better pictures. There are several flash options on this camera that allow you to take the highest quality photos. One of these is automatic which makes it as easy as point and shoot. This camera can easily be hooked up to a common television, to be used as a monitor for a slide show of your photos. Also, hooking it up to your computer and printing/sharing your photos is a snap.<br><br>
