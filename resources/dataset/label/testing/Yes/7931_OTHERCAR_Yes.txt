            Reliable? HA what a stupid question...I own a Jeep Wrangler 97' it is the best SUV I haver EVER seen.  I give it 10+ stars! (out of 10).  I was in 2 spin outs on snow.  I hit the curb sideways and bounced over it, both going over 25.  Not a single dent on the jeep.  It is the BEST manufactured vehicle in its class that I have EVER seen.  I love my jeep.  I live in Colorado (in fact it is snowing right now) as I was driving back from school, I noticed about 50 cars abandonned on the side of the road...Rav4, 4runner, Land Cruiser, Range Rovers.  I was one of the only SUVs that had actually made it to the top of our 1ft snow covered hilly roads.  Its very lovable, and WELL worth the price.  VERY CHEAP for the amount of things it can do.  I am going to the next Jeep Jamboree.  It is going to rock!<br><br>
