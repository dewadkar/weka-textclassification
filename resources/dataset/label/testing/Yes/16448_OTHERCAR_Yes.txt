            Hello, I'm here to talk to you about the FujiFilm FinePix 2400Z, or 2400 Zoom. This camera has big pros, but also cons. Here's my review.

First of all, when you take the camera, you see that this devices is very lightweight, 0.7 oz. But due of this fact and that's is little, I found that the camera is empty, and that does not give me the satisfaction that the camera is reliable and tough. At first, I think it's made more cheaper than the Olympus D-320L. But I can't give a conclusion of that. Only time will maybe conclude this.

For taking picture, you need to open the lens covers, and click it more deeper in the right. This click really annoying me, because I always think that I pull too hard. This plastic cover that can shake is not one of my pros.

When started, the very good display screen open. A very good definition of colors can be displayed on this screen and with the fraction of the battery life, compared to the Olympus D-320L that 'DRINK' battery life!
The option is easy to use when you know how they work. I could'nt start to use all the function without reading the manual given by the company, that is a little bit confusing because there's no table of contents or index.

The quality of the picture is excellent. It make, in low quality, better that the Olympus that I got for birthday in high quality mode. You got 9 options to exactly know what you want in your 16MB SmartMedia card. You got LOW, MED AND HIGH, and sub-option, FINE, NORMAL, DRAFT. Excellent quality picture, but I will not give 5, because there's better than that.

The Zoom is good. It's maybe only a 3X, but it's enough powerful to see only the eye of somebody who is about 1 meter of you. That's good. The switch to set the Zoom is good also.

The software that came with the camera work really bad. I use Windows XP, and that disable me the video-conferencing function, only available in PC, by the way. When I connect, it's OK. But if I disconnect, I connect again without restart, it crash. With the Fuji Update for Windows XP, (10.5mb!) it's worst!! I can't use the camera after that.
So I could'nt use the video-conferencing option right now. But when I will, I'll come back to update my review.

The camera can be used in English and French. The French version don't use the Canadian-French date system, that sometimes, because I'm a French language person, annoy me.

This camera is a really good choice and I recommend it. The picture quality and the good battery life of this device is very, very good. But the reliability of Fugi will be tested with me. If I have problem, you will be the first to know. :)

Thank you for reading, JPEG, don't forget to vote!
