            My family and i bought this car thinking we needed a van to hold many people to get from one location to the next.  What we didn't expect was to drive this van just to drive it.  Now, grant we bought this a couple years back for about $19,000 +, I still think that this car is great.  We can usually hold 6 grown adults and 1 child (given that everyone sits accordingly.)  The van gets good mileage I would have to say around 15 local and 20 on the freeway at best.  

My family and I like to travel a lot by way of the automobile.  We travel distances ranging from a mere 200 to a good 2500.  We like to take road trips.  Back before the MPV, we had to rent cars and usually, we paid more than we got.  That's never a good thing to have to shell out more money than you have to.  So yeah, this baby takes us where we need to go and in comfort.  

This automobile is a big one.  You are seated higher so you can see more of the road, making driving a little safer.  It's not too big like those oversized SUVs out there.  The V6 engine gives this car enough power to go up hill and keep up with the flow of traffic.  

It makes you feel really safe when you are driving this car.  The only concern I have had with this car is that about a year ago, my brakes locked up on me when it was raining.  I felt really scared.  But the brakes soon released when I pumped the brakes.  It didn't feel like it was going to tip over so that's a positive.  

I think that a family of 4 - 6 should buy this car because you can take people from place to place with comfort unlike a compact car.  You can also use it to carpool to work and have eveyrone at work pitch in for gas or what not.  I don't know who shouldn't buy this car.  I think it was a good buy for me and my family.  There have been some manufacturing problems with this car such as the seal on the window being lose.  Other than that, I don't think my family's had much issue with it.  Maintain it well and don't abuse it, and I am most positive that your MPV would be an MVP.<br><br>
