            We decided to replace my wife's two door Honda Accord with something more suitable for child seats and car pooling. After driving my pickup truck my wife found she liked the extra height and road handling qualities of truck type vehicle. But she was uncomfortable driving something as wide as a full sized pickup. We wanted a vehicle that could carry six adults, or six kids and two adults comfortable. Since she has a pathological hatred of minivans, we were able to quickly narrow the selection to SUV's with 3rd seating based on 1/4 ton pickup frames.

Our candidate vehicles Durango, 4 door explorer and Trailblazer/Envoy XL. We had rented a Durango for a trip to Maine last fall. The 2000 mile round trip gave us a good feel for the vehicle, and thought it would be adequate. But we did find the brakes too sensitive, and the styling and options to be sub-par. 

Before researching the Explorer in detail we both thought it would be our choice based on the glowing reviews it was getting. But in talking with people at our offices we discovered six Fords (SUV, minivan and pickup) with either V6 or V8 that have developed head gaskets problems. My wife also rejected the Explorer based on the interior features.
 
We had purchased a new GMC Sierra 2500 HD in October that we both like very much. But the mediocre reviews of the Envoy/Envoy XL left us thinking it would be our third choice. That changed once we started our detailed examination of the truck. My wife liked the interior and the commonality with the truck. After test driving one we decided this would be the vehicle.

With GM's $3000 discount or 0% for 60 month deal we decided it would be a good time to act, so we checked the local dealers' inventories and found a unit equipped like we wanted. After some haggling, and a short but frank discussion with the sales manager on the accuracy of Edmunds invoice pricing and dealership processing fees they agreed to sell it at Edmunds invoice. I encourage everyone to reject the processing fees dealers (and some real estate brokers now) try to charge, they are simply additional profit to dealerships.

My wife is thoroughly enjoying her SUV, or as she calls it her mommy mobile. The DVD is a nice feature not only for the kids, but it also keeps adult entertained while sitting in rush hour traffic on long commutes. The dual zone climate control is an excellent feature, and will be a must on any vehicle we buy in the future. I like the adjustable shelf included in the cargo area, and third row seat access is very easy with the fold up second row seats. And all three rows offer good leg room even for 6' passengers. The rear doors provide easy access for installing or removing car seats on either side. My wife, at 5'2" can reach up and close the rear gate when it&#146s open. And the automatic wipers are a nice feature, though I originally thought I would not like them.

The 5.3L V8 gives it very good acceleration, and it really does handle like a large car instead of a small truck. The ride is exceptionally quite even at highway speed. The multi-driver seat memory is also a nice feature for couples. We are averaging 17.6 miles highway and city driving. The 26 gallon tank is adequate, but I wish it were three or four gallons larger.

The four wheel drive system has an automatic setting in addition to the now standard 2 wheel, 4 high and 4 low settings. In automatic mode, the Envoy is supposed to enter 4 high if the rear wheels begin to slip. I don't know how effective the system really is since we have not driven it through poor traction conditions yet. Our pickup is used for our off road driving so I can't comment on the Envoy's off road handling.

I strongly dislike paying for the onstar equipment. We live in an area of poor cell phone coverage rendering onstar service useless as it is cell phone based, not satellite based as some of the marketing material implies. Even if there was excellent cell phone service everywhere we went, however I still would not choose to equip my vehicles with remote monitoring systems. 

My other complaints are based more on comparing features to my Sierra 2500 HD SLT truck and not actually problems with the Envoy. First the pickup's DIC has an hour meter, and each trip odometer also calculates the mileage and average speed for that trip. All these functions are missing from the Envoy. The external temperature is displayed on the rear view mirror of the pickup, but is displayed on the climate control setting of the Envoy. The mirror is a superior location as you can see it at a glance, but have to search for it on the Envoy. The passenger's temperature setting is not saved as is the driver's settings. Each time a new driver starts the Envoy, it resets the passenger's temperature to the driver's setting. And the turn signals on the mirrors are much harder to see on the Envoy during daylight hours, than the system used on the Sierra.

As I've explained above my negative comments are more based on differences between the Envoy and our Sierra , and not really problems themselves. I know it sounds like an add, but my wife has repeatedly told me how much she enjoys her new SUV, and she never dreamed of owning anything like the Envoy.
