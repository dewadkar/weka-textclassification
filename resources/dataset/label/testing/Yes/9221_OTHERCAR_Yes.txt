            While searching for the perfect replacement for a flawless "98" Accord EX V6 coupe and comparing the various sport product offerings from Mercedes Benz, BMW, Jaguar, Lexus, Acura and Honda, one particular model just stood out like a dandelion on a world class golf course.
First exposure to the 2004 Solara V6 SLE was a complete accident while casually strolling into a local Toyota dealership following encounters with a plethora of ho-hum product offerings at other dealerships.  At first meeting, the Toyota sales rep mentioned the fact that an entirely new Solara coupe was about to be launched in mid September.
Well, after viewing a pre-introductory spy photo that the dealership staff found on the internet, the search was over.
Body lines rivaling those of a Mercedes CLK and an options list similar to a Lexus are just the starters for this particular model.  Coupled with leather interior, a JBL sound system, in dash 6 CD changer, air bags out the wazoo, power sunroof, a snappy V6 mated to an auto/manual option 5 speed transmission,17" wheel/tire package and sport tuned suspension round out the basics.
The new Solara V6 SLE won't keep up with a Mercedes CLK on the autobaun, nor will it keep pace with a BMW 328 on a road coarse but what it does best is compromise in all areas.
In short, the engine/transmission combo for this particular model allows for brisk acceleration while getting descent gas mileage on regular unleaded fuel.  Handling is right up there with most front wheel drive sport coupe packages without compromising ride quality and interior/trunk space is quite spacious compared with other sport coupe offerings.
As for a wish list of minor items, a fully adjustable power passenger seat would be nice, a more user friendly/easily accessible cruise control lever, a driver seat allowing for more rearward travel and yes, a little more bottom end torque from the V6 would make the package just about perfect.  But who or what in this world is perfect?  
The 2004 Solara V6 SLE comes close for the under 30K price tag and that my friends earns the folks at Toyota an A+ grade for their contribution to the sport coupe market.
