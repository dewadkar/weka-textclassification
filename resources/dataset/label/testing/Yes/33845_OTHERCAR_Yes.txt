            I can't think of one bad thing to say about my Honda Accord. I purchased this car in 1993 and except for tune ups, oil changes and tires the car still runs great. My car has 100000 miles on it and still has the original battery and most everything else. It has never broken down or not started right up, even on the coldest day. The heat works great as does the A/C. The amount of money you save on gas alone is worth the price of the car. I plan on keeping this car for many more years and strongly suggest that you lok at an Accord if you are looking for a mid-size car.<br><br>
