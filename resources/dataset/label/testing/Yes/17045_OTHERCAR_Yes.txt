            After test-driving many SUVs, including the Explorer,  I've found that The Dodge Durango is on top of its class. The Durango is just so much fun to drive.  You haven't experienced power until you've sat on top of the Durango's massive V-8 engine.  The Durango is a dream to drive in just about all conditions.  It handle's great in snow and rain.  I once took my Durango off-roading with a friend and was absolutely amazed at how well the Durango handled the terrain.  The Durango is an great car to rive, its just so much fun. The Durango also has plenty of options to make it even better.  Also the Durango can fit up to 7 people.  Which is a lot more than other cars in its class.  The Durango also has plenty of towing capacity.  I own a boat and my Durango can tow it with out a problem.  The Durango also looks really sweet.  It comes in a variety of colors and interiors.  So you can mix and match to find a car which fits your style.  However, one drawback on the Durango is it uses a lot of gasoline.  But its worth it the Durango is just so much fun to drive.  I think the Durango is the perfect car for people who love to drive and love a lot of power because the Durango can provide both of those things. <br><br>
