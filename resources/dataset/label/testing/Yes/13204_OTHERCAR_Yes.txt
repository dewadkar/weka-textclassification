            I have had this Camera for a couple of months and have no major complaints.  For those new to digital cameras (as I was) the Canon A70 gets up and going in no time.  I was taking pictures less than five minutes after opening the box.  Install 4 AA Batteries (included), slide in the flash card (idiot proof), press the power button, set the mode switch to shoot, and go.

There are 11 shooting modes other than auto that are easy to understand with a quick breeze through the manual.  The number of settings and effects available are extensive.  The Optical zoom is nice and even the digital zoom is decent.  It also shoots high quality movies with sound.

The drawbacks, not many.  I have heard complaints about the sturdiness of the battery and flash card covers.  They could break if you are rough or careless with them, but seem just fine under normal use.  I have also read complaints about the LCD Monitor scratching easily.  The camera comes with a thin plastic protective monitor cover and I have just trimmed it and kept it on, no problems.  The software program is where this camera falls short. It is very easy to use, but also does very little.  If you plan on doing anything other than very basic photo manipulation, you will need to get a separate program.

As far as the batteries are concerned, it's a double edged sword.  I like the fact that it takes regular AA batteries.
They are inexpensive and available just about anywhere.  It also takes NiMH rechargables, but does not come with the camera.  NiMH batteries will last longer because of their power output design, but a charger with a set of back-up batteries will run about $40. NiMH batteries will also drain over time. I bought 24 Energizer Max Batteries at Home Depot for ten bucks.  At $1.70 per battery change, alkalines are just too cheap and convenient to get a NiMH charger. Just realize you will be changing batteries frequently.  Unless you will be using the camera constantly, I recommend sticking with the regular AA's.
