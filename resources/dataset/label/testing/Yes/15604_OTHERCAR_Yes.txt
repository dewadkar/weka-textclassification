            The first digital camera I had experience with was the Sony MVC 71; from there I moved to the MVC-91; and now, I have added the Sony MVC-CD1000 to my digital arsenal.Even at all of their original prices, they have more than earned their salt.  

For all beginners, the MVC 71 is a great point and shoot camera.  It has a few extras on it that are good basic 
instructional features to prepare the user for the next step up. The MVC 91 is the next step! Features include different picture effects, being able to immediately display a shot.  It also has a built in flash and a basic auto shot handling to the camera. It also has an auto focus that makes it better than the MVC71. The user can zoom in very easily; this zoom is also more effective than the 71. Another unique feature is that the user can video like a :60 sound bite and insert into web sites, etc. 

Plus, the greatest thing I like is the LCD display!  No more trying to center a shot using a tiny lens like on a conventional camera!  The user can hold this camera up or down or whatever and line the shot up and then focus in!  It is, like mentioned, a great second-step camera and the price has only gotten lower since it first came out!  

I also like the ease of using and storing pix on floppies and inserting the pix in publications, greeting cards, and e-mails whenever I like!  Given the background and picture composition, a floppy disc can store from 30 to 45 pix.  Plus, there's no more film developing charges!

Resolution wise, a picture is also only as good as the photographer.  If the user doesn't focus and center the shot, then the pix will show that.  However, with Adobe photo shop, pictures can be cropped and some increased resolution can be added.

Battery wise, the MVC91 battery endures for two hours of full time use; hence, turning it off when not in use is, of course advisable.  Use common sense.

Sony also lives up to the warranty and if the camera ever needs repair, go to the SONY site and they will have a listing of local SONY repair places.  The service is quick and even if the warranty has run out, the repair costs are reasonable.
