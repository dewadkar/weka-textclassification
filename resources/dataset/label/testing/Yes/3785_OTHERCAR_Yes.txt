            You can sit and read about the pros and cons of this car, but it won't do the driving experience justice. BMWs, and the M series in particular, have an intangible quality to them that translates into something just short of magic when driving. Car magazines can rate handling, braking, acceleration, etc., but overall there is an over-riding subjective element that inspires confidence when driving. And that's what it's all about for many BMW drivers: enjoying the art of driving.
The designers of this car have their fundamentals straight. Even the interior ergonomics affirm this as the dash is angled toward the driver (a hallmark stamp of all BMWs). This car is about the art of driving. It has excellent acceleration, handling, and braking. You can push this vehicle, and it does not lose its composure. Try the new Michelin Pilot SX tires -- they're a great match. Also, this is not a flashy sports car that screams &quot;look at me,&quot; which I consider to be a bonus. Some might feel, in fact, that it looks too similar to the 318 line. However, you're less apt to flag the attention of the Highway Patrol in this car, than you'd be in a C5 Vette. Also, this is a practical car. I can fold down the rear seats and have relatively  enormous carrying capacity for a sports car. This is a car that you can drive every day with little hassle.  Overall, the M3 is technologically sophisticated, subtle yet competent, highly refined, and fairly priced.
