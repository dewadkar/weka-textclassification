            I have heard complaints about the older Grand Am's but I haven't had any excessive problems with my 1999.  I bought the car when it wasn't even on the lot yet; I &quot;stole&quot; it from a salesman.  After driving a 1985 Chevy celebrity for 4 years I was impressed by it's smooth ride.  It has been about a year and a half since I got the car and am still impressed with it.  The interior is quite roomy and I like being able to adjust the height of the driver seat.  All of the major controls (i.e air conditioning, radio, lights..) are easily accessible.  My only complaint is the cup holders are useless when the car is in park.  Especially if it has anything larger than a small cup from McDonald's or any other place.  I do have a problem with noise that I can hear through the rear passenger side door, but only when it has been raining and the roads are wet.  This I was told is a manufacturers defect and all the bending in the world won't fix it.  The shape of the door also damaged the seal but I haven't had a problem with it since it was replaced over a year ago.<br>I love the new look of the Grand Am.  I was really impressed when I first got it because, as I said, I had one of the first on the road and other people seemed impressed.  It is a lot sportier (especially with the rear spoiler!)<br><br><br>
