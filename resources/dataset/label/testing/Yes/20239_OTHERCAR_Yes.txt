            I believe that the Chevy Malibu is a terrific value for the money.  Not fancy, not sporty, not an eye-catcher, but a smooth, quiet riding car with plenty of interior space.  I currently am driving a 99--4 cylinder, after previously driving a 98--6 cylinder and a 97--4 cylinder.  All three have had very good gas mileage (20 mpg in city driving and over 30 on the highway) for a mid-size car.  The acceleration from both engines is adequate, if most of your driving is city driving.  For drivers, who do a lot of highway driving, the V-6 is a better choice.  It is now standard on the 2000 model.  The car is very quiet and delivers a smooth, refined ride.  The car feels like a bigger car, and gives the driver confidence for driving in all kinds of weather.  Small rattles and other small noises are some of the few annoying features of this otherwise tight and solid car.  My 97 needed to have a module replaced.  My 98 had no problems in 9000 miles.  But, my 99 has had a small coolant leak, that two dealers have been unable to find.  I have added one and a half quarts of antifreeze mixture in 7000 miles/9 months.  I am wondering if the problem will get worse, and if so, whether it will be easier for the dealer to identify.  Other than that, I still like the car a lot, and think it is an excellent buy for the money, compared with the competition.  Of course, if you keep your cars a long time, or want something fancier, look at the Accord or Camry, which are clearly the best in the mid-size sedan market.<br><br>
