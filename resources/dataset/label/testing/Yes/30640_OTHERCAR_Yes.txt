            First, the cons, because they're always more interesting.

The lower side bolstering on the seats is way too firm. It feels great if your legs are straight in front of you, but if you put your left foot on the dead pedal, your leg will quickly go numb, and there's nowhere comfortable to put your right leg other than on the gas pedal. If you're wearing jeans, the seams from your back pockets will be pressed into your leg, which becomes painful after an hour or two. YMMV, though: apparently I'm the only person on the web who has this problem. When lowering the seats past a certain point, I can hear plastic bits crunching and snapping.

The cruise control stalk is awful. You could sit comfortably with both feet flat on the floor (with CC on) if it weren't for the placement of the CC stalk. So you have to rest your right leg at an awkward angle, and even then, it's very easy to bump the CC stalk up or down, which turns it off.

You can't adjust the wiper intervals. Most econoboxes have that feature. Why doesn't my luxury car? It does have a cool feature where, when the wipers are on, they switch to interval at a stop. But when set to interval, they disappointingly do not turn off at a stop.

The dealer will install a keyless entry system for $580. Enough said about that.

Now, the pros.

I _love_ the size of this car. Most luxury cars are much bigger (and therefore heavier and less maneuverable) and I just don't need that much space. The 3 series is perfect; it's actually slightly smaller than a Honda Civic, but my 6'1 frame still fits with plenty of headroom to spare, and even some legroom for the passenger behind me. Why buy a small, sporty Japanese car with no headroom and unusable back seats when it's actually bigger than the 3 series??

The suspension is very firm (thanks to the sports package) but the ride is very pleasant because of the chassis rigidity--if you hit a bump, you can feel it, but the car doesn't feel like it's going to twist itself to pieces. The ride is also nice because there's very little road or engine noise. There's some wind noise at 50 MPH, but not enough to make you talk louder to your passenger.

The engine is great. Stepping on the gas gives you a satisfying neck snapping jolt (curiously absent in other fast cars like the Maxima or even Corvette), and after that, you just get pushed gently back into your seat, without any theatrics. The car _feels_ much slower than it really is, just because the engine and drivetrain (RWD) are so smooth. RWD obviously means no torque steer. The handling is great, esp. with 50/50 weight distribution--the car leans very evenly when you take a turn hard. There's hardly any body roll. Driving around town, you can take turns without slowing down and it's still comfortable.

The fit & finish of the car is excellent. My car is 6 years old and there's only an occasional squeak or rattle. All of the accessory motors--power locks, power windows, power seats, sunroof--still feel very strong. The doors are very light but feel bizarrely solid when they close.

My last comment is that it's a BMW. Everybody associates BMW with luxury and prestige. When I tell people what kind of car I drive or they see it for themselves, they're always impressed. I didn't buy the car for this reason, and I didn't anticipate this at all, but it's a nice fringe benefit.
