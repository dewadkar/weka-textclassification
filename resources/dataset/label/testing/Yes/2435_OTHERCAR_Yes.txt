            I have one. I have always had Mitsubishi vehicles and I love them. My husband and I have driven them for 12 or more years. I am very well known at the dealership and very well respected. I get hugs instead of handshakes! I got my 2002 MONTERO LIMITED for Valentines day from my husband this year, even though I got it a few months early, just couldn't wait. I have really enjoyed the performance, seeing others stare and the sense of safety I get when driving it. I am a housewife and an inventor so I do a lot of driving, about 80,000 a year! It has been nothing but a joy. However, no matter what vehicle you buy you need to make sure it fits YOU! The third seat in the back that folds down would not be comfortable for an adult. This I knew when I purchased but think about it. If you don't plan to transport 7 full sized adults EVERYDAY why would you need a permanent third seat? I only ride my two kids so it fits up perfectly. Frankly, I prefer the room to haul other things. The Montero definitely does that. Just to give you an example, I put in the back, WITHOUT, folding down the second row seats a full sized bike. 1 very large suitcase, 2 very large duffel bags packed with clothes, 1 tricycle, a couple of shoe boxes, 3 large purses, a sunshade, and a scooter that would not fold because my son had broken it!! Now tell me you can get all that in any vehicle. You can't. Just imagine what you could put in there with the second seats folded. The sunroof is huge. It is definitely a winner for parades. I have had many people that wanted to ride in my ride because you can get all the way out of the sunroof and don't touch the sides. It is absolutely gorgeous. I put everything they had for it on it. It is just beautiful. It has so much storage inside. 2 glove compartments. The middle console has 2 compartments. There is an out let to plug your cell phone hidden in the middle console, you would never know it is there! Both front seats are heated! It is a smooth ride. I have never had a problem with power. I am always leaving others behind after waiting at a light and no, that is not by overdriving. Maybe the people who don't think it has enough power just don't know how to drive it! You can make it 2 or 4 wheel drive or you can shift! Power and heated exterior mirrors. It has rear airconditioning and heat! My kids love being able to control that. The sound system is totally awesome. I read another review that said it wasn't but maybe that person doesn't listen to the right music! I don't think classical and opera sound good on anything!
You will love all the accessories that are available. I believe vehicles are like people. Maybe the vehicles in the bad reviews did not like their drivers! You have to buy a vehicle that suits YOUR life. Maybe you don't want a third seat that will seat a cow and maybe you do. If the Montero fits you perfectly like it does me, you will love it! Last thing, I don't like the 2003 model though. I don't like the body style. If you want to be absolutely beautiful like me, you may want to run out and buy the 2002 before they all are gone. The 2003 is styled differently and I just don't like it. But you might so to each his own on the styling. I am sorry to write so much but I think when you have driven Mitsubishi's for 12 years you are entitled to say a lot. If you would be interested in seeing pictures of what it looks like with all the accessories, please let me know! Happy MONTERO-ing!!
