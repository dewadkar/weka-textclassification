            How do I love my Celica?  Let me count the ways:

1. It is sporty, and looks great.
2. It gets great gas mileage.
3. It is reliable.  
4. It is good performance.  It isn't the fastest car, but the performance
   is nice.

The '91 Celica is a great car for students, commuters wanting a sporty alternative, or teenagers that are getting their first car.  Since I would recommend this car to consumers, I thought I would add some of the tricks I've learned while shopping for a used Toyota product.  These tips aren't necessarily deal breakers, but they may help you decide whether you want to purchase a specific vehicle.

In addition to taking a car to a mechanic to have it checked out before purchase, you may want to look at the following:

 - The oil filter that is being used on the car.  
Why the oil filter? Toyota vehicles require an oil filter with an &quot;anti-drain back&quot; valve.  This valve prevents the oil from draining out of the filter when the engine is shut off.  This allows oil to be available to the engine when the vehicle starts.  This is especially important in cold climates where people may start the vehicle and rev the engine to warm the vehicle up before there the oil has a chance to circulate.  If you live in a climate that gets really cold in the winter and read the ads for used Toyotas you may notice several ads that state &quot; ...so many miles on a new or rebuilt engine...&quot;  These people probably did not use the proper oil filter and had to pay the consequence of rebuilding or replacing the engine.  It is easy to check to see if the vehicle has the stock Toyota oil filter, since the filter is in the front of the engine compartment and the filter is black and has &quot;Toyota&quot; written on it.  Also note that vehicles serviced at one of the &quot;chain&quot; oil change places probably do not receive an oil filter with the anti-drain back valve.  These filters are more expensive than regular filters, so they probably aren't used.

- Look for VIN stickers on all panels of the vehicle.  When you are looking at the vehicle check the inside surface of all the panels (front and rear quarter panels, trunk lid, doors, etc.) to see if there is a vehicle identification number (VIN) sticker on it.  If there is not a VIN sticker on every panel, the vehicle may have been in an accident and that panel was replaced.  Aside from the panel being replaced, who knows what other unseen damage there is.

These are additional tips that I would have for anyone buying a used Toyota of any type.  Please use these tips in addition to other used car buying tips.  

As far as the Celica goes, it is another great Toyota product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable, sporty vehicle with good fuel economy.<br><br>
