            I have a 1994 Volvo 850 Turbo Wagon and I just love it!  I have owned four other Volvos and I'm planning to buy a new V70 in a couple of years.

I bought this car used from my parents when they moved up to a V70 about a year and a half ago.  I have never enjoyed a car so much.  My previous Volvo was a 240 DL Wagon.  It was nice, but the 850 is so much better!

I've been getting about 24 miles per gallon lately, even in the 90-100 degree Texas heat with the air conditioner at full blast.  With gas getting so expensive, mileage is a very important factor for me.

My first Volvo was totalled when a woman ran a red light and slammed into the driver's side door, rolling my car onto it's top.  Obviously, the driver's side was right where I was sitting, but the only injury I received was a tiny cut from glass on my right wrist.  The paramedics were amazed!  That is one reason that I have continued to buy Volvos.

My 850 recently rolled over to 100,000 miles and the only problem I've had with it is the front oxygen sensor went bad a couple of months ago.  The people at Autobahn in Fort Worth couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  They're great!

Another reason that I like this car is that I have plenty of room to haul around my dogs.  I have two mutts and a Great Dane, so as you might imagine, I need plenty of space!  :)
