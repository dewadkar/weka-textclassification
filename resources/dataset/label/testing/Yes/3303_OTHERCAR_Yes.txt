               I own a 95 4runner and love the vehicle but it does not have enough pick up. I have not had any problems with it but take incredible care of the car. The ride on road is decent but the off road capability is incredible. The only thing that the car does not have is pick up. This problemed was fixed in the 96 model which is a better vehicle. I would highly recommend any one to purchase a 96 or above model if it is affordable.<br><br>
