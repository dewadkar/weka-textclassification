            As the title states, I did not buy this vehicle, I set up a 3 year lease.  Of the options I had, wanting a reliable vehicle and low monthly payments, this was a wonderful buy.

I got the model with the extended cab, third door and all the extras.  Power windows, locks and steering, CD player, two extra cigarette lighter plugs (for things such as laptop and cell phone).

The drive is very nice, although, the suspension seems a bit tight on uneven roads.  But the cockpit is ergonomically designed, with everything in a comfortable position.

With a three year lease, i certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, solid first truck.  It is inexpensive but full of features.  Monthly payments are low and easy (electronic withdrawal can be set up) through GMAC.  Gas mileage is also very good.

Keyless entry is great.  Have never even put the key in the door yet.  Auto volume CD/Radio.  Nice feature that adjusts volume as your speed changes.  Auto headlamps also are cool.  Daytime running lamps, and special sensors to turn them on in low light.

It looking for a good truck, with little to no desire to do heavy loading or towing, I would say this is the best truck for the money.<br><br>
