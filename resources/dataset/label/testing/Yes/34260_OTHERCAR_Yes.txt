            Please refer to: http://www.xk8.net/xtype/messages/ for the best discussion I've found on the Jaguar X-Type. I have previously posted the following on that site. 

We received our 2.5
automatic X-Type, White Onyx, Sand interior, single CD player, a little over 2 weeks ago. I'll update if anything happens. We only have 300 miles so far. So what
one might classify as a JD Powers initial quality review would be that we have zero defects so far. The car is as billed. It's actually a little nicer than the 3 different
X-types we drove during our nitpicky "demo" phase. 

I won't review the car, since it's been reviewed enough elsewhere (in the magazines). We've driven it over rough roads, with no rattles.  

So here's some personal observations:

Our car arrived after 9 weeks (late by about 2 weeks). They even told us how long it takes on the "boat", how long it takes on the dock, and how long it takes in
transit (from memory, it's 8 days on the boat from England, 5-7 days on the unloading dock, and the same in transit. Any "build" date you were given is not exactly a
"build" date. Meaning it's a beginning date in a build process, but the factory doesn't necessarily build your car on the "build" date. Make sure to tell your salesperson
to tag your car as "sold" in the system, then the dock will unload it sooner than the unsold cars on the boat, saving you a couple days.)

Although I haven't seen this yet in the paperwork, the sales rep. said ours was described as a 2002.25, or a 2002 and a quarter year model. I don't know what this
means, but we haven't had problems yet with windshield washers. Trunk latch is the only thing that bothers me, although it always closes ok for my wife. The dealer
said to press the trunk latch button again if it doesn't close properly. At worst, this seems like a minor issue.

As far as fit and finish, better than the demos, although there are some minor "wrinkles" in the center of the leather back seat upholstery and on the rear passenger
side that might bother some purists. But nothing that would cause us to bring it in. Other than that, I keep staring at everything, and I can't find any problems. 

Remember to take advantage of the fact that there is now a single CD player available for an extra $200. So now you don't have to buy the option packages to get a
CD. 

Some general observations:

Wind noise through windows - fair - not bad
Road noise from tar strips - pretty high, not as bad as my '98 Toyota Avalon, but you can't hide from it
Road noise from tires - fair - not bad at all

Fan/air - pretty noisy in "automatic" model, fine in all manual modes. Heats up reasonably quickly on cold Chicago winter days.

Our sales person, upon picking up the car, said there is 0, Zero, miles break-in period. The X-Type needs no break-in period. He also said that the way the car is
designed, that it needs no warmup period before driving. Just start the car and drive away. He also claimed that the design allowed for quicker warming because of
the way that heat is diverted from the engine. He also said to leave the AC button on year-round. He said the British treat AC differently. Whatever. That's what he
said, and that's why I'm sharing it with you. 

I'm not a car expert, and I don't care to or claim to be one. I'm also not a Jaguar loyalist, so if I encounter problems, you will hear about it in follow-ups. Good luck with yours. Don't forget http://www.xk8.net/xtype/messages/ for a very good discussion forum on the Jaguar X-Type. 

Update after 2 months: Still Good. As opposed to other owners, I find mileage to be very poor, however. 12-14 miles city, 17 miles hwy. I have never been accused of having a leadfoot.  Senior Jaguar mechanic said it sounds about right. Other owners claim miraculous mileage. Only problem after 2 months of daily driving, the radio. As Brock Yates said in his Car and Driver review - poor reception. That is my problem too. Certain stations always sound distorted/static on the high end of range. My dealer has contacted England for a fix. They tested whole system, coax, antenna, etc.,  tried to swap radios, with same problem so far.


Radio fixed by swapping, mileage up to 16 mpg in city. There are other minor issues, but I have never addressed them with the dealer.
