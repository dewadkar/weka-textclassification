            This car is winner even though I'm not a fan of domestic vehicles.  It has a beautiful exterior design and the interior is very nice.  The only 2 thing bad I think about this car is that the back bucket seats.  ANd the other bad thing is when my friend was driving his power steering went out.  Thats definitely a minus.  They do not have a lot of room back. The car is very quiet while driving.  Does not have any unusual sounds to it.  The stock rims are really nice.  Wouldn't even consider buying new rims.  I just love it overall.  Merucry has done it again. Great car.<br><br>
