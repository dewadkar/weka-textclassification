            This is my first Honda automobile (I've owned Honda motorcycles) and I am totally in awe of the engineering on this car. It is SO well thought-out and designed. Little details abound so every day I find another new thing to love about this car.

I bought a LX sedan with the 2.4 liter i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine and the 5-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4, while not making an abundance of low-end torque, is quick to rev, smooth, makes great sounds, and provides this car with quick acceleration. The 5-speed auto is buttery smooth, something that was not said about previous Honda auto trannies.

The standard ABS disc/drum brakes are very powerful and effective.

The handling is predictable and stable. It's not as sporty as the Mazda 6, but it feels very confident and easy to control, even when pushing it. The ride is solid and taut, but not harsh. Much more solid and sporty than the floaty Camry.

Frankly, when I first saw the 2003 Accord in print I wasn't so impressed. But when I saw it in person it began to grow on me. Now, every day I find another angle that looks awesome on this car. I have a feeling that this car's styling will stand the test of time.

The interior is the best feature of this car. It is gorgeous! I find it to be very roomy front and back. The seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat in. Really supportive and firm. Definitely not mushy. And the driver's seat is height adjustable with a simple and effective ratchet lever. 

The new dash design is stunning. The large LED gauges are incredibly clear and easy to read. The new radio and HVAC controls are intuitive and operate with precision and silky smoothness.

The new AM/FM/CD sound system is a huge improvement over previous Honda factory sound systems and is good enough that I will just leave it alone.

There is a 1-liter-sized bottle holder in every door, in addition to the standard cupholders. The front-center armrest moves in a front to back adjustment range. The steering wheel is height-adjustable and telescopes. The remote entry fob is integrated into the key so you don't have to carry around a separate fob.

This car is so quality. When the doors are closed they make a solid "thump" sound that reeks of quality. Every control, door pull, and switch operates like a fine instrument. It's amazing that Honda is able to have such a high level of excellence in such a mainstream product. This car feels like it cost twice what I paid for it. 

The Honda Accord splits the difference in the market. It's sportier than the Toyota Camry, but not as hard-core as the Mazda 6. It does everything well. And don't forget, when the time comes to sell or trade it, nothing holds its value like a Honda Accord!
