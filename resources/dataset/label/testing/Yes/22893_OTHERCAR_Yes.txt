            This is a great car for those who want a fun vehicle, which Miata often claims as its title. 

Let me go over the specs briefly:

Engine: 2.4L Inline 4 cylinders 145HP 155lb/ft 12 Valve    Sohc (Code name: KA24E)

Drivetrain: RWD(Rear wheel drive), either Auto 4-speed transimission with lockup torque converter or manual 5-speed transmission

Body type: 2 doors 2+2 either Coupe or Hatchback

As a student, I was into used car market for a while. I have found that many Hondas and Toyotas were too overpriced. Even a used bonestock Civic Hatchback(cheapest model) would cost well over $6000-7000. =P

However, I was able to find this awesome vehicle that costs a fraction of what a used Honda Prelude or Toyota Celica would cost. 

This car has more torque and horsepowers than any other vehicles in its category at the time of production. It has good low-mid range power which makes driving easy and fun. It's easy to pass on highways and burn rear tires if one desires. It also can tow a Jet-ski or a snowmobile. 

Handling is what this car is all about. It easily pulls 1.00+g at corners with a set of sticky Z-rated tires, which would cost about $400. 1.00+g is more than a stock Viper can generate. Multi-link suspesions work magically to put powers through rear wheels which are firmly planted on the road. It is so easy to drive at the limit. Once you get to know the taste of drifting, you'll beg for more. This car can outhandle pretty much anything out there on the road. 
You want to corner fast in a controlled way? This is the car for you.

It also has sexy and rare look. My car turns heads even though it's completely stock. I don't have to spend $2000 for rims and body kits to get attention. Both females and males like its sleek design. 

It is also extremely reliable. My car has 200,100+miles. However, it still runs strong. Nissan transmission and engine are bullet proof. 

For all of these, I paid $3000. Not a bad deal..eh?
