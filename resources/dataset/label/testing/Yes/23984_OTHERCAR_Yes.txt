            I bought a Silver 1993 Volvo 850 GLT back in May of 1997 for around around $14,500 with 72,000 miles on it.  Financed it with payments over 3 years of around $470 and own the car as of May 2000.  Since I've had the car it has a rock solid feel to it and there probably aren't many cars today that are more safe.

I now have 135,200 miles on the car and have just gotten the car back with repairs of a few problems and some maintenance items.  If you do own a Volvo and live in the midwest (particularly Ohio area), try the Volvo Shop in Ravenna, OH.  These guys are the absolute best in the midwest.  They are a family of Volvo mechanics that have been working on these cars since the late 50's.  They have about 400 old Volvo in their yard that they use for parts and they know more about Volvo than 2 of the Volvo dealerships I have gone to.  The father Carl owns the business and has been working on them for 35 years.  His (2) sons Dave and Mark are also working in the business.

Anyway... since I've had the car front and back rotors have been replaced and the pads have been replaced twice.  Pay particular attention to the post that another person puts on this site about rotors warping in the front and needing to be replaced.  It is 100% true because most of the weight distribution of the car is put onto the front and hence the front rotors take about 80-90% of the punishment.  Is a matter of fact I've gone with brand new pads for about 25,000 miles before had them checked and the fronts had about 10-15% left while the back had about 85% left.  Just something to be aware of.

Also... Another known area that this car has problems is in air conditioning system.  Particularly the compressor and/or the evaporator are known to go bad on this car.  I have had my compressor replaced already ($500) and my evaporator is currently bad (at least $1400 Volvo and $850 at the Volvo Shop) so I don't have air.  The evaporator is the more expensive and difficult to replace because it is behind the dashboard and requires more labor to get to it.  Frequently the evaporator will get little pin holes in it which might be able to be repaired by using R-134a (you can get from Walmart) with the oil and sealer in it, but I haven't had much luck.  You can also try buying the Super Seal Pro product($20-30 per can) from Autozone or your local auto parts dealer.  This is just sealant not the R-134a so you would need to add that afterwords.  That is my next approach, but haven't gotten around to it yet since the weather is cooling here in Ohio.

Another set of problems that are common for the 850 GLT with automatic transmission is to have the gear position sensor go bad.  You will know this by getting a blinking arrow light on you dashboard.  Sometimes the problem only happens intermittently when the weather starts getting colder and it can be repaired by turning the car off and on or moving the gear selector up and down about 15-20 times fast while the car is off, but I would do this too much.  Inevitably the problem will get worse and you would need to replace the part because the light won't go off.  The problem could cause the shift points to be changed in the transmission, which might lead to a blackening of the transmission fluid and eventually hurting the transmission.  Also you might need to get the economy/sport mode switch repaired and the s1 solenoid as a result of fixing the gear position sensor.  These are all parts that show codes from the same electrical control unit (ecu) and help to run the transmission.  They aren't part of the tranmsission, but they are electrical components that are involved in running it.  These are just a list of some of the items I've had repaired and have read about many others on the internet with the same issues.  

Also, it would be wise to keep and eye on the tie rod ends and front struts ($70 for both).  These have gotten worn in my car and been replaced.  You will notice this if the front of you car appears to sit lower when you are in it and/or you here creaking noises coming from the front when you turn the wheel or drive onto a driveway.  They can be done when the brakes are done to eliminate the labor and for both of the front wheels you shouldn't pay more than $100 combined for parts.  This should also vastly improve your handling if the handling has gotten worse.  

You might also want to check on the exhaust system to make sure there aren't any holes (small or larger).  Exhaust usually last about 10 years on the 850's and most are at the end of their life today if they haven't been changed already.  This could be costly and since the entire exhaust is pretty much one part you might have to replace everything.  Once again "Volvo Shop" in Ravenna, OH is best and most fair because they charge $50 for labor and actually know what they are doing.

All-in-all I've probably put about $3000-$3500 in parts and labor into the old Volvo over the past 5 years.  A tidy some, but I drive a $32,000 luxury car that is still in good shape and is probably only at it's half-life.  Seriously though... Volvo's truly are excellent cars.  If you take care of them you could easily get 250,000+ miles out of the transmission and I've heard Volvo engines will run forever as long as you do your oil changes.  I hope to have mine a while longer, although my wife's impending desire to own an SUV with 1 child and 1 on the way is getting greater.  Who knows though I might win by getting her the SUV, keeping the Volvo our Honda and saving my 850 for our 3 year old son.  Unfortunately.. I don't think she'll allow me to have the Volvo sit in our driveway for 13 years.  WISHFUL THINKING!!!
