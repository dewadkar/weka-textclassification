            Shopped carefully before Christmas.  Most offerings do not have through the lens viewing, and most have a cheezy zoom.  Megapixel size does matter at higher magnifications and the 4900 is easily as good as any 3.3 megapixel on the market today.

Look around, you won't find a better camera in the sub $1000 price range (I paid $780 for mine - e-mail me for the site)

This is a camera, not a toy.  With a TTL viewer that works even with trifocal glasses, a 210mm (35 mm equivalent)zoom and excellent optics this is a camera that will satisfy any previous owner of a 35mm camera.

The computer USB install was flawless on Windows ME and Windows 2000.
Picture quality is simply amazing, clear bold colors and incredible detail under magnification.  Ink jet Printing is close to photo quality.

OK, so the author is sold, what are the downsides?

SmartMedia is currently limited to 64 megs, or less than 15 shots under best resolution.  Other cameras have CF slots and IBM microdrive capability.  Expect to spend some time downloading pics to your computer.  At lower resolutions, 35 and 77 pics at fine and basic compression.  I thought I would be disappointed with these levels but I can hardly tell the difference between these compressed and the uncompressed pictures.  At the lowest resolution and highest compression you can get 300+ pictures on a 64 meg Smartmedia Card.

Another downside but equal to the current offerings out there are the multitude of buttons that must be pressed to call up all of the programmed power of this unit.

I urge those who are on the fence waiting for SLR equivalence at reasonable prices in digital photography to take a close look at the Fuji FinePix 4900.  35 mm SLR performance in a digital camera at reasonable prices is already here.<br><br>
