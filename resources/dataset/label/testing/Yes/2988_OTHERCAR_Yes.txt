            I purchased my 1993 Jeep Wrangler about a month ago and so far I don't have very much to complain about and I can be quite a picky person!  However, I can say this much, if your personality doesn't fit a Jeep then don't ever buy one!  For instance, the bumping and jarring that sometimes occurs (depending on road conditions) can be quite a nuisance if you don't enjoy driving (or riding) your Jeep.  All in all though, I've been having a great time driving mine around town as well as off-roading with it!

I must also comment on how catchy to the eye driving a Jeep can be.  I've heard nothing but compliments on how my Jeep looks driving down the road as well as just parked in a parking lot.  And really, what can beat driving down the road with the top off and the stereo turned up?!  The only unfortunate thing (if you don't have a soundbar) is the amount of road noise that can be heard if you don't have a good stereo.

Overall, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone whoever dreamed of owning one!  However, if you're looking for a family car...then this is not it.  The room capacity of four (including driver) is by far not the best for an SUV but, then again, a Wrangler is not an ordinary SUV.<br><br>
