            We needed a compact car with four doors, because my wife gets nervous driving larger cars and we have two kids.  After test driving Honda Civics, Toyota Corollas and Geo Prisms (and being disillusioned by either high prices or chintzy materials), we decided to have a closer look at the Dodge Neon.  A friend of ours had one and she really liked it.

We found a red 1998 Highline with the SOHC 2.0L engine in it.  After test driving it, we were convinced that this was the car.  It was decently quick, very roomy inside for a small car, relatively quiet and promised good gas mileage.  The price was also right, as we are on a very tight budget.

The large amounts of glass on the car allow a good view while driving, and no blind spots are to be had.  The automatic transmission shifts crisply, but not harshly.  The engine has enough power to allow confidence when merging onto the freeways.  The suspension is nice and tight, maybe a little stiff, but the car handles curves extremely well, which is an acceptable trade-off.  We have averaged 34 miles per gallon, but this mileage has dipped to 23 miles per gallon during more &quot;spirited&quot; driving.

There was a whistling noise coming from the rear driver's side door, but this is to be expected from cars with frameless windows.  A little silicone oil on the rubber seal got rid of the annoying noise.

The trunk space is something that we were pleasantly surprised with.  Even though this is a small car, stowage space is enormous.  We have been able to fit a stroller, a bouncer seat, two car seats and two kids in the back with minimal effort.  The high lift on the deck lid allows easy access to the trunk compartment.

With a year and over 15,000 miles on it now, we have had no problems with it.  Regular oil changes and minor maintenance items like light-bulbs and brake pads are all we have had done to it.

The only things we don't like about this car is that the depreciation value is so high.  It will never have the resale value of a Honda or Toyota, but then again, we plan on keeping this car for a long time.  Also, the engine can be a little raucous, making lots of noise especially when the gas pedal is floored.  Overall, however, this car is a solid performer with ample space for passengers and cargo.  It's a bargain for the amount of performance received.<br><br>
