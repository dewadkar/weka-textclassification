            My wife and I went looking for a new SUV this fall, test driving many different models, like the Honda CRV, the Toyota RAV4, and the Saturn Vue. It wasn't until we got to test drive the 2003 Mazda Tribute, that we were sure on what vehicle we wanted to purchase.

The Mazda Tribute, very comparable to the Ford Escape, has the true SUV appearance, durability, and performance. The only major difference between the Mazda Tribute and other SUV's like it, was the price. We ended up paying a reasonable price for a high quality SUV.

After we had decided that the 2003 Mazda Tribute was for us, we were nowhere close to driving the vehicle off the lot. We still had to choose between the many different models, packages and options that comes with the Tribute.
Listed below were some of the options we had to choose from:

<b><i>ENGINE TYPE:</i></b>

There are two engine types/sizes for the 2003 Tribute.

After we decided what type of engine we wanted, we had to decide on what model of the Tribute we wanted. There are basically three models, DX, LX and ES. Now, because we chose to have Engine B, it eliminated the DX model, because the DX model only has ENGINE A. In fact, the LX and ES can only have ENGINE B.

At this point in time, we were left with choosing between the LX and the ES models of the Tribute. After glancing through the specification brochure given to us by the dealer, we were not quite too sure, due to the similarities between the two. I noticed that we had another big decision to make in the meanwhile, and that was whether or not we wanted to have 2-Wheel-Drive or All-Wheel-Drive. From my previous car ownership experiences, this decision was very simple. Due to the fact that we live in the country and do quite a bit of off-roading, we had no other choice but to get the All-Wheel-Drive.

We had now come to our hardest decision of all. We had to choose between the LX and ES models of the 2003 Mazda Tribute. What made the decision more challenging was weighing the benefits of the difference between the two models and the price difference between the two models.

Price Difference:
Tribute LX Model (with AWD) $30,210 Canada  $19,490 USA
Tribute ES Model (with AWD) $33,870 Canada  $21,850 USA
Difference in Price:        $ 3,660 Canada  $ 2,360 USA

Difference in Features:
4-wheel, 4-sensor, 3-channel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
Electronic Brake Distribution System (EBFD)
Trailer Towing Pkg.
Electric Sliding Glass Moonroof
AM/FM Stereo w/ 6-Disc in-dash CD Changer, cassette, clock and High Grade Audio Sound System (includes 7 speakers with a 90w amp. super woofer (total output 190 watts))
Leather wrapped Steering Wheel
Leather Seating

After a long debate, we decided that it was worth the extra money to get the ES model. This debating and decision making took several hours, but when it was all said and done, here is the final details of the Tribute ES, that we purchased.


Exterior Color: Black (Also comes in Blue, White, or Beige)
Interior Color: Black (Also comes in White and Beige)

City Mileage:    13.1L/100km   (22 MPG)

<b>Extras Included:</b>
Key-less remote entry, Power Windows, doors, locks, trunk,

moonroof, CD changer and tinted windows.

The warranty on the 2003 Mazda Tribute was 3 years or 80,000km (50,000 Miles) on all factory parts and labour. I decided to upgrade my warranty to 5 years or 120,000 km (75,000 Miles), which also includes the paint job, sheet metal framing and brakes, for an additional $1000 Canada (650 USA). This is an excellent upgrade probability, because it saves you on possible maintenance charges later on in the life of the vehicle.


Since we have owned the Tribute, we have noticed that everyone who sees it, loves it. In fact, my first cousin is buying one just like the one we own, later this year.

Ratings:

Handling: 9.3/10
Very easy to handle, not as big as a truck, so parking is a synch.

Reliability: 9.5/10
No problems since we bought the car. One thing to note, to keep the warranty valid, you must get an oil change every 2 months.

Comfort: 10/10
With a moonroof, leather seats, A/C and a CD changer, this vechile makes you feel like you are at home.

Quality/Craftsmanship: 9.8/10
We love the design, both internal and external. It is designed for all terrain, so you could go just about anywhere.

Value: 9.9/10
This Vehicle gives you all the luxuries and conveniences of an expensive SUV, for the price of a standard automobile.

Overall Rating: 9.9/10
My suggestion to you, is to give this vehicle a chance, test drive it, and I know you will fall in love with it as much as me and my wife did.
