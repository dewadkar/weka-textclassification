            We love our Ford Econoline E-150.  It is big enough for our 3 kids, with room to spare for the dogs.  The storage area behind the 3rd row bench is large enough for the family bikes (we have the Chateau with quad captains chairs and a third row bench seat, total seating: 7). We can't wait to take our new van on a long road trip.  Handling is much better than we expected, considering the size, and the MPG can be controlled somewhat with the cruise control (and slower speeds).  The one really stand-out benefit of the full size van is the view.  With so much glass surrounding the passengers, the view is wonderful (plus the fact your so high up off the ground).  This is both a great vacation vehicle and a real asset when it comes to "busing" the kids all over town.

In closing, it is important to note that State Farm has included the Ford E-150 on its list of the 36 safest vehicles.  As a result, the Econoline receives substantial discounts on insurance cost (which helps to offset the lower MPG).
