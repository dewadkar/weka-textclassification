            This camera very easily fits in your pocket, yet it takes quality shots. The 3.2 megapixel sensor allows you to create photo quality 8X10 prints. It also has a 3x optical zoom plus 4X digital zoom, for a total of 12x zoom. That's pretty impressive for a camera of this size. 

The camera comes with a 16MB Secure Digital card, which, in my opinion is not enough. I purchased a 256mb SD card. The rechargeable lithium ion battery is charged externally, which I like, because I purchased a second one which I always have charged, making it easy to swap out batteries. Battery life is excellent.

The Dimage xi also takes video pictures, including audio.It has many manual picture taking options or you can set it to automatic, and not worry about any of it.

Although the camera takes sharp, clear pictures, it is very easy to block the lens when taking pictures. I took a few shots and couldn't figure out why there was some blur on the edges. It turns out it was my hair that got in the way!Also, the quality of the pictures diminish in low light.
This is one of the disadvantages of a smaller camera. 

The Dimage Xi does not have a sturdy feel to it. It is very light, and so it feels like a toy in your hand.

I don't like the software that comes with it. It is not easy to use and there's not much to it. The camera has a USB port and comes with the cable to connect to your PC.
