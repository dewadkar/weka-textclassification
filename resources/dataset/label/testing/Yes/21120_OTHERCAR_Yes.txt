            Audi  TT, 2003

The Other German Roadster.

Between 1979 and 1994, I owned a Mercedes  450 SL. It was a great roadster and I always enjoyed driving it around. So when the opportunity was offered to by the local BMW dealer to test drive some of their models, the first thing I did was to ask if they had a TT roadster as a demo that I could take out for a spin.

Well they did and I have to admit that I found it very hard to take it back. This is a dream automobile.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

In 2001 Audi  added the roadster to their line up of fine automobile. For the roadster they also added a new and more powerful engine than they offer in the coupe.

The Audi TT Roadster, features a soft top with a heated rear glass window.  When electrically lowered both the top and the glass window fold and recess behind the rear seat. This is very similar to my old 450, with the exception that I had to do it manually.

Also it comes with a power retractable glass-windbreak that the driver can raise to reduce the wind turbulence while driving on the highway. This retractable rear glass is located immediately behind the two roll bars.

The power top is standard on the Roadster version while optional on the coupe model. 

Both models are available in either front-wheel-drive or the Audi&#146s all-wheel-drive configuration.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As soon as I opened the driver&#146s door and proceeded to lower the top, I immediately knew I was going to enjoy this drive. 

Both models come with standard leather seats and they are made of fine quality leather. I have to mention that getting behind the wheel of the Audi TT, is not as easy as it was with my old SL. But I still managed to slide in, I immediately remembered why I sold my Mercedes, in these roadster you sit very close to the ground and because of an old back injury I can nit stay in that position for a long period of time.

The TT comes with a long list of standard equipment.  Included are air conditioning, power locks, windows and mirrors. Plus cruise control, heated seats, AM/FM cassette radio and alloyed wheels.

From the driver&#146s position the all-around vision is excellent, all the gauges are easy to see and all the controls are within reach.

All the material used inside the TT, is of excellent quality and the workmanship is also excellent.

Being that it is a Roadster, I will not make much of the restricted space.

The sound system is excellent, but I was a little disappointed that a CD player is only optional and was not part of the equipment for the car I drove.     

The exterior:

This automobile is very beautiful, the styling is excellent and the paint job is of the highest quality.

I did not care too much for the design of alloyed wheel on the car I drove and I am not certain if a new buyer can select from a variety of designs.

The trunk space at 13.8 cubic feet is very good for a sport car, I remember that I always liked the fact that my 450 had a good amount of trunk space available also. 

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The Audi TT I test drove had under the hood:

Engine: A 1.8 liters motor, turbocharged developing 225 horsepower.
Transmission: A 6-speed manual transmission.
Brakes: Front and rear discs with ABS.

           Side airbags.
           Traction control.
           Keyless remote entry.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

Yes, it was lots of fun taking out the Audi TT for a spin. I asked if I could make it an extended one and since it was early Monday morning the manager had no problem with this. 

On the highway the car rides like a dream and what a pleasure to feel the wind in your hair. Within the city limit the fact that it had a manual transmission was a pain but it is a little price to pay for the joy of driving the TT.
