            The Agfa ePhoto CL50 comes with a 8MB SmartMedia card and has a resolution up to 1600 x 1200. The camera has four resolution modes to pick from, 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960, 640 x 480 pixels and 1280 x 960 in black and white mode.

It has a 2&quot; high resolution color LCD display for reviewing or capturing your images and an optical viewfinder.

The built-in flash has 4 flash modes, Auto, Fill-in, Red eye reduction and Off, you can also use external flash synchronization.

The lens has auto and manual focus with macro. In Auto focus mode it has a 3 x optical zoom with macro, plus a 2 x digital zoom in the VGA mode.                                 

Image format is JPEG and on the 8MB SmartMedia card you can get 12 images in the 1600 x 1200 mode, 24 images in the                                     1280 x 960 mode, 24 images in the 1280 x 960 mode and 96 images in the 640 x 480 mode.

It comes with the following in the box: ePhoto CL50 Digital Camera, 8 MB (3.3V) SSFDC SmartMedia memory card, Soft case with a wrist strap, Serial cable for the PC, Mac adapter cable for the Macintosh, A/V cable for a TV output and 4 AA batteries. The software in it is Agfa PhotoWise, PhotoGenie and Adobe PhotoShop plug-in for Macintosh. One manual and instructions.      

Requirements are 16 MB of RAM, 50 MB of hard disk space, VGA monitor with 256 colors or greater, 2x or faster CD-ROM and an RS-232 serial port. For the PC you will need a Pentium processor or higher with Microsoft Windows 98, 95, NT or higher. For the Macintosh a PowerPC Processor with a System 7.5.3 or higher. 

The only complaint I have is it takes about a second after you hit the button to take the picture, if you move it to quickly it will blur the photo. 

The zoom works great and the picture quality is good, not great. 

This is a great little digital camera for the beginner.
