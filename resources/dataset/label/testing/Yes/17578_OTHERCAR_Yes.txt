            This truck can handle it all.  I have a 1998 Toyota Tacoma TRD package 4*4.  This truck is the most popular vehicle within my hunting club members.  I hunt in south Mississippi on a local military base.  The Tacoma is able to handle the tank trails with ease.  With a locking differential and on the fly four wheel drive, the TRD handles trails most four wheel drives avoid.  Even with stock tires and shocks, I have only been stuck once.  On this occasion, all 4 tires were spinning and I had to be pulled out of the hole by a 1 ton winch.  The shocks handle large bumps with no problems or lose of traction.  The only complaint I have is the thickness on the body.  The panels of the Tacoma bend easily.  

A plus for the TRD package is the fun add-ons.  The TRD has a supercharger which increases the horsepower by 50+ and torque by 50+ ft/lbs.  In addition, carbon metallic disc brake pads, modified exhaust systems, sport shocks, and high-performance cam shafts can be purchased for the vehicle.  It is possible to make this truck the &quot;man&quot; of the off-road. I believe for hunting this is the ideal truck which has multiple upgrades yet a satisfactory stock level vehicle.<br><br>
