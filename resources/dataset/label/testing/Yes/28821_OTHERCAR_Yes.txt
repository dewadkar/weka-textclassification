            I must say digital cameras are an excellent idea, and I can't speak for other camera's  but this one is not the easiest to operate.  I work at a collision repair center and as you would guess I work with a group of men, and they are computer illiterate men so..., when we got this camera we thought it would be a good idea for taking before and after photos of the vehicles we are repairing.  This camera is very difficult to figure out the photo card doesn't hold that many photos to begin with but it takes a while to figure out how to delete them,  We have had problems with the camera cutting on for about 5 secs. and then cutting off and we couldn't get it back on, we called Kodak and come to find out you have to do an update to the camera to get it to work again. I don't know about you but that's a little strange for a new camera, why didn't it come with the update? Who knows? If you are looking for  an easy camera to use this is not the one for you.<br><br>
