            My daughter just graduated from college in June and purchased her first new car - a Daewoo Nubira.  The model she selected was the CDX hatchback. It has a stereo/cassette/CD player, alarm, automatic transmission and full power.  He opted for leather interior.  Total price about $14,000.  Warranty for tranny and power train is 5 years.  Routine maintenance is included for two years.  They threw in a Daewoo 17&quot; color TV and gave her $1000 trade-in for her 1990 Hyundai.  We drove the car to Chicago from Long Island for her new job and it handled well at 70 mph on the highway.  Small enough to fit in tight parking spots, but an unusually roomy trunk.  Service centers are located throughout the US.  Outside of routine maintenance, she has had no trouble with the car.  She did get her rear taillight smashed in a parking lot and took it to Daewoo for repairs.  Surprise!  They gave her a new taillight, installed it - all for $75. She likes the looks of the car, the color selections and the layout of the instrument panel - everything is easy to reach and the windshields are angled so that even at 5 feet tall she has a good view overall.  What I noticed is that every where we went, other Daewoo owners would honk and wave.  It's like a secret club of the new generation of car buyers - those who dare to be different and yet want a solid, reliable car for a fair price.<br><br>
