            I purchased the 1999 Town and Country AWD in November of 1998 after looking at a number of the alternatives out there.  I had intended to purchase a Toyota Sienna after a good experience with a 1992 Previa van (benignly competent but reliable as the sunrise...), but it was too small for my growing (2 petite girls and 3 boys at 6' plus) family.  The Toyota Sienna also had a lousy sound system, and trim levels were below par for such an expensive vehicle.  So I drove the Chrysler, considering the All-Wheel Drive version as a plus for New England winters.

The Chrysler had lots of room, heated seats, a great sound system, and comfortable and roomy seating.  The front and rear disc brakes were nicely progressive and could haul speed down very quickly with no drama.  The engine, though lacking the sense of refinement of the 3.0 liter Toyota V6, was powerful and certainly adequate to the task.  Chrysler engineering had also done a good job of working out many small details, using microprocessors to protect people from themselves; i.e. shutting off interior lights when kids left the door open, etc.

After nearly two years with the car and over 36,000 miles, I can report a great ownership experience.  Other than routine fluid service, the car has not had a single service issue in two years of ownership.  Having owned Chrysler products in the past, this was a pleasant surprise.  

The driving experience continues to be excellent--New England cannot throw enough snow on the road to trip this vehicle up, and everyday, non-snow use also leaves the impression of the car being glued to the road.  It is still a big vehicle and therefore not "flingable" in the small car sense,  but the ride impression is solid, well-damped, and comfortable.  Interior noise levels are low. Air conditioning and heating are first rate, and controls have been easy to live with for the long haul.  Overall fuel economy runs about 19 mpg with 23 mpg on tap for highway only use.

One warning:  In the course of regularly scheduled maintenance, I discovered that the 4-speed Chrysler transmission requires unique automatic transmission fluid, type "7176" to be exact.  Our "no appointment service center" replaced the fluid with Dexron III and then added an "antifrictive additive" at the 30,000 mile service interval.  The transmission immediately started to misbehave.  After doing some research, it was clear that "7176" fluid is REQUIRED in this application.  Ignorance regarding this issue is rampant, even among dealerships, auto parts stores, and others who really should know.  Changing the fluid to what should have been there in the first place corrected all problems. Do not let anyone talk you into a substitute--to be safe, have a good, reputable dealer do that particular job. 

An update:

The T&C now has almost 73,000 miles on the odometer and I'm pleased to report a continued excellent ownership experience.  There has been one "sub-$500" repair in the power train where the bearings got noisy in the "torque tube", the viscous clutch that sends power to both axles. The noise was annoying, so we fixed it, but my understanding was that the powertrain should have continued to function normally had we decided not to fix it.  All of the functions and accessories have worked flawlessly, including the heated seats (In previous cars I've owned, those heating elements have had a tendency toward a short life span).  Front brake pads were replaced at 65,000 miles--the rotors were not machined as it was simply not required.  The "original equipment" Michelin tires also lasted to 65,000, as much of a testament to the T&C's solid, well aligned chassis as to the tire quality itself.  Someone who was less picky about the tread left on the tire could have probably pulled an additional 15,000 miles on the tires. New England winters and my general prudence prevent me from taking the tread down to the "wear indicators".

In all, a very satisfactory ownership experience so far.  We intend to keep the T&C in service for the next few years, so I will post an update at 100,000 miles.
