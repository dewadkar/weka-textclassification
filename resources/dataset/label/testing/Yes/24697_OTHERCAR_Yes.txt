            We ventured into the world of minivans from an SUV when we were expecting our second child.  The venture offers built-in child safety seats which was a must have.  Two sliding doors also attracted us.  The crash test was not the best one, but still high enough to make us feel that safety isn't compromised.  There is enough room to pack up the two kids, the dog and more luggage than we really need to take on a long trip without feeling crowded.  
The remote sliding door is easily controlled and has a safety mechanism to prevent accidental opening or closing on top of anything.  The seats can be easily adjusted to create more space without having to take them completely out.  The built in child seat can not be in a captains chair, but it is definitely worth having!  The entire seat can be reclined safely with the child in the restraint to allow more comfort for long trips and naps.  
The cup holders are good in number, but poor in location.  Beverages are stored beside the bottom of the seats making them difficult to reach.  The back seat is difficult to get into when a child seat is belted into the middle seat or if the seat belt for the middle is ready to be used.
