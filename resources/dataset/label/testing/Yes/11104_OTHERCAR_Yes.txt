            The Ricoh-2 has become my favorite little toy. Nothing I have purchased in the last few years,with the exception of my computer system,has given me more hours of fun than this piece of electronic wizardry.

I am by no means a professional photographer, but this camera was designed for me, the amateur. The LDC screen gives instant gratification when a good picture is taken, and allows you to delete the ones you want nobody else to see. You can take up to 39 pictures in economy mode(without a card). It also allows you to record up to 10 seconds of sound with each shot.

The camera takes good clean crisp pictures outside and in well lit areas inside. I do find the flash a little weak in poorly lit situations. The accompanying photo studio software is also very easy to use. I've enlarged several pictures of the kids with good results.

The only major drawback I find is that it eats batteries. After seeing what others have paid for their Ricoh-2,I'm thrilled that I got mine for only $299. from Ubid.com 2 years ago.<br><br>
