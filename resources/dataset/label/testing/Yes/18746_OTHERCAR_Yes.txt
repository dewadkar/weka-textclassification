            I just purchased this car used. I could not believe the shape that this car was in... after 10 years it looked like it was fresh off the lot...the seat were still firm and the leather was in "like new" condition. 

I was a bit weary about a car with over 100k miles so I had the engine checked out and it passed all the tests with flying colors. Now for the review:

Comfort:
Extremly comfortable, my particular model has every option and I feel like I'm driving a 2001 German Sedan, nothing is missing.

Handling:
Amazingly tight. Almost no body lean/roll. High speed cornering feels as though you are on rails.

Power:
Still packs a punch with 122k miles on it. Would love to see what it felt like new.

Now for the "cons":
Braking... although they are very tight and stop on a dime they don't feel as though they are of the same quality that the rest of the car is, take that for what's worth.

Road noise... In the drivers seat I didn't notice it but while riding in the back seat It seemed as though there was  a speaker coming out of the hole from the shoulder portion of the seat belt next to my ear. I could here the road, the  strut... everything. 

Overall this car is fun to drive and no one can believe that it is a 1992. This car is more feature rich than most 2001 luxury cars.
