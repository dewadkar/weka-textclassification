            You can drive a car. You can drive a truck.  Or you can drive a Jeep. In my opinion, jeeps offer a totally divergent proposition all their own. If you�re driving needs include fun, you don�t need to budget carefully on fuel, you enjoy the spontaneity of a convertible yet desire the rugged ramble of a 4WD, consider a Jeep. If you choose a Jeep don�t plan on getting much in passenger or cargo space and depending on the model you may need to tolerate a bit of road noise. If this opinion is adding to your enticement, get off the internet and go test drive a Jeep. Informed opinions are half of the equation. The other half comes when you actually sit behind the wheels and decide for yourself. 

I�ve owned three Jeeps in the past fifteen years. My latest is a 1998 Wrangler hardtop. I�ve learned a few things since driving her brand spanking new chassis off the lot. First, the tight turning radius and the compact size allow both parking and maneuvering advantages.

Next, the hardtop is sometimes a bother to remove because I can�t lift it by myself. 
However, the mechanics of getting it on and off are relatively slick. I have it down to a seven minute science.

Finally, I believe in preventative measures. So two years and 30,000 miles later I have only taken her to the shop twice for minor repairs covered under the warranty. The switch for the windshield wipers and turning signal has been replaced twice. The second repair was due to careless installation during the first trip back to the dealer. In addition, I had the rubber plug on the rear differential checked. My regular lube/oil/filter guy tipped me off to the problem. A local service center graciously fixed a leak with no charge and I�m writing it off as an anomaly. 

In summary, I know my next vehicle will be a Jeep. My driving need equation is 50% fun and 50% function. A new jeep fits my bill perfectly.
