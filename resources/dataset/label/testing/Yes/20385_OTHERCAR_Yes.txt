            I have owned this car since 93' with only minor repairs, such as thermostat, fuel filter replacement, and annual ABS break adjustments. For a four-cylinder car, it definitely has a notable amount of power. Spacious enough for medium height people, however, I would not recommend filling front and backseats; knees will be crunched. Good family car-great gas mileage!I would recommend this car to anyone who drives a whole lot. Mine takes me to work, then school everyday. I also take at least one road trip every month (200-500 miles). If possible, try to find one with something other than ABS brakes.
I personally don't like them. They do have to be adjusted periodically, but this can be done at home-very easy.<br><br>
