            If you have seen a Pontiac Bonneville or a Chevrolet Impala sedan, then you have a good clue of what the Oldsmobile Aurora is all about.  In my case, my curiosity got the better of me, especially after test-driving the Chevrolet Impala.  I wanted to check the <b>2002 Oldsmobile Aurora</b> to get a better idea of what General Motors engineers have been able to create.  In fact, since its inception in 1994, the Aurora has been the flagship of this venerable automotive company.  It has remained a true trailblazer and a pioneer in the areas of innovation and change.  Great was my surprise when I found out that the Oldsmobile division would be discontinued.  No matter what, the Aurora, just like the Chevrolet Impala and Alero, attracts and appeals many car enthusiasts.  It's still a good car to buy.  After all, General Motors will be around to provide maintenance, service, parts and other repair that might become necessary over time.  

<b>A quiet admirer of Aurora, my test-drive and my observations</b>

For a long time now, I have been a loyal user of GM vehicles.  I am proud to say that my consumerist thirst has been quenched by the large variety of reliable vehicles they have brought to the market.  I did not have to be asked twice to consider test-driving the Aurora.  Available in two models, the Aurora has known a new redesign since last year.  My tester was the Aurora 4.0.  Initially, I had my eyes set on the 3.5, but the salesperson could only open the 4.0L V-8 model which was the subject of a lot of improvements just a year ago.  Those enhancements were done to incorporate a new internal architecture giving the sedan the absolute highest level of integrity and reliability.  

<i>What did I find out about this sedan?</i>

<b>Interior, displays and controls</b>

You will be greatly surprised by the new redesign.  Oldsmobile engineers have managed to create more head and shoulder room while shrinking the overall dimensions of the car.  More than that, I was amazed at the level of precision and details given to the interior of the car.  Once I was inside the cabin, I could not help but checking out the displays and controls.  They reminded me of the little Cessna planes I used to plan flights for in Latin America.  It's the "cockpit-style driver's area" that's so appealing to more and more Oldsmobile enthusiasts.  As I was test-driving this car on the freeway, on many occasions, I was more than tempted to engage in aggressive driving.  I was only reminded that the CHP drive all kinds of vehicles these days.  Very often, they just blend in with the traffic to sneak up on bad drivers.  

On a beautiful Fall day, I found myself driving down 99 in all comfort and without any worry of the world.  The ride was quiet and smooth.  Each time it fell upon me to accelerate to merge onto traffic or change lane, I drew enough juice from the V8 engine of the Aurora to perform my driving feast.  The Aurora was very responsive and solid.  It was nothing like one of these flimsy, paper-towel-like light vehicles.  Behind the steering wheel and sitting on well-trimmed leather seats, I took in the cool breeze blowing all over the Central Valley of California.  The four-wheel independent suspension system includes the following hardware:  MacPherson struts, coil springs and a 30-mm stabilizer bar in front; a tri-link setup, coil springs with a semi-trailing arm and 20-mm stabilizer bar in the rear.  I must quickly note that if there were any bumps and potholes on the freeway and subsequent roads I took, I did not notice them.  The car is equipped with the the PCS, Precision Control System which is an automatic vehicle stability system designed to improve cornering during adverse driving situations.  Also, the leather seats are standard on both models.

<b>What else is worth noting on the Aurora?</b>

The Aurora has a good cargo capacity of 14.9 cubic feet.  The 4.0L V-8 250 hp engine delivers well.  The fuel economy for the V8 is 18 city/28 highway.  Some of the standard safety/security equipment includes and is not limited to the following:  dual front airbags, driver and front passenger side-impact airbags, four-wheel disc brakes with anti-lock, automatic power headlamps, tire inflation monitor, remote keyless entry, battery rundown protection, passKey theft deterrent system, daytime running lamps OnStar communications system with one year of service and front/rear fog lamps.  In this part of the country, fog lamps are very important.  The thick fog, tule fog season is just around the corner.  Without the right fog lamps, many lives have been lost.

<b>What have I found out about this car?</b>

If the Oldsmobile engineers created this car to compete against the likes of Lincoln LS, Acura RL, Lexus ES 300, they were somewhat right.  The Aurora is a strong, solid vehicle that should have continued to be around.  Unfortunately, economics dictates what lives and what dies among cars.  If you can find an Aurora, I would say to get it.  As I indicated earlier, GM will stand behind its cars whether or not their division gets the ax.

That's the only thing to be concerned about at this point.
