            From the minute I set eyes on my two-door Honda Civix EX 2000 I was in love.  I decided to test our newly formed relationship by taking my new car across the country.  Yes, I was sad to put 13,000 miles on my car during the first month, but let me tell you, this car performed !!!

First let's start off with the visuals: 
 It is extremely sporty looking, especially with the added addition of a whale tail.  The best part about the car is that it is roomier than the hatchback, and even though it is two doors- the backseat has plenty of ample leg room.  With the proper wheels, or new rims, the civic almost looks like a BMW but with those 'personal' lights.

The interior -standard-comes with a sunroof, and other added amenities such as cup holders, and CD player.

One thing that i had added , was more sound to the speakers because the sound system did not get very loud.  Another thing to look at, especially if you live in the mountains, is that the car has very little acceleration or power up large hills.  However, in any other condition the car flies.  

It is an affordable car that gives you a lot of bang for your buck. On my entire 6 week trip, the car never let me down and powered my Air Conditioning 24 hours straight.  Everything is easy to use and there is ample trunk and back seat space.  I would recommend this car for anyone and everyone.<br><br>
