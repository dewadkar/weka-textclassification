            First off, I must say that I'm just a bit biased when I write this opinion. After all, I do own three different Chevy Blazers (1984, 1987, and 1999) and they are the only motor vehicles I will drive. So suffice to say I bought my newest Blazer on the reputation of my older two Blazers. The '84 and '87 were the two most reliable trucks I have ever seen. I beat the hell out of the '84 for a solid 16 years and just decided that it was time for a new one. 

Do you know what I really love about the Blazer? It is the most versatile vehicle Chevy has ever made, with the exception of the El Camino. The Blazer feels like a car, handles like a truck, has four wheel drive, and plenty of backseat space. I would have to say that the only thing I dislike about the '99 model is that the tow package was kinda weak compared to the '84 model; and I think the engine is a little too underpowered.  

I must say in all reality that this is a guy's car. Every woman that I've ever let drive the truck said that they didn't like it, the pedal was too stiff and the seat was uncomfortable. My answer to that is &quot;That's how I like it!&quot;  A car should ride rough and steer rougher. 

I'm not going to spew nonsense and technical specifications; if you want that go to Chevrolet's website. Bottom line: at least give the Blazer a test-drive. Maybe you just might like it, maybe you'll outright love it.<br><br>
