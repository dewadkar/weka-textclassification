            Before I start to praise and rant about my most favorite car in the world, I would like to mention that I am a compulsive perfectionist. I have not been on earth for too long, but have had two American cars before I acquired my Grand AM.  Both previous cars were bought used and I can still remember how every day enjoyable rides were often turned into "Let's see what goes wrong today" rides. I have a gift for noticing the smallest sound and also worrying too much ahead of time about what MIGHT happen. I hated to worry. I drove a lot of different models when I was looking into buying a new car. I was looking for a two door, sporty, somewhat fast, gorgeous looking car. Everything I knew was out on the road did not strike me at all. Everything is so plain these days, I wanted something..."WOW". After weeks of thinking, I was stumped, and then I remembered the Grand AM. I loved to see those door beauties on the road. So I went to Pontiac. I ended up with my baby 2003 GT, and went for the appearance SC/T package which consisted of a Ram Air hood, a spoiler, and sporty 16 inch chrome rims with low profile tires. I would have to say that no car has ever amazed me so much as this Grand AM. I remember just standing there in awe, not being able to move. I looked at the Ram Air hood and then said to myself this is my car. So I guess I am trying to say that I think Pontiac really did a wonderful job by fulfilling the fantasy of those people that like aggressive, hot and sporty rides. I was satisfied.

The aggressive, stylish, futuristic look of my Silver Grand AM GT SC/T is not the only thing that makes it out of this world. It has amazing handling. It is grounded to the floor just enough to hug every curve and to swallow every bump in it's way. 

It is amazingly fast, with 170 Horse Power for the regular GT, and an additional 5 HP for the Ram Air. It has 205 pound torque, which means the take off is very quick if you have to push it to the floor to get out of a dangerous situation or just show off and take off and leave everyone else to stare and drool. 

Another wonderful aspect is the visibility. Even if you like to sit low like in a true sport car and move your seat all the way down as it will go, you will never have trouble seeing behind or around you. 

There are people that are indifferent to the kind of car they drive. I am one of those people that likes to love the things I own and enjoy them to the fullest. I could have bought a little Civic and that would get me to work and there and back on my weekend trips, but I decided if I am going to buy a new car, I will make sure I will not start to hate it some time down the road. Just looking at the front end of the Grand AM GT, it looks like it was made for speed and to be driven like it is stolen, though I do try to treat it nicely. When it's on the road, it owns it. 

Not many true sports cars can handle the road very well in the rain or snow. The Grand AM is front wheel drive, so you will never have problems in bad weather conditions. The wheels grip and never slip. And the best part is, it is still a sports car without all the minuses of a true sports car. It has no attitude changes and no special picky preferences, it loves the road and knows it's place on it. With it's dual exhaust system and the V6 3.4 engine that roars just right, it's everything you have ever wanted in a sports car for the affordable price. 

I also love the "bulky" look of it. It looks thick all around and low to the ground. It looks like it is a strong car and feels heavy at times, but not after you hit that gas pedal, because it will fly as if it's a feather.
