            I bought a '99 V6 Mustang and I really enjoy it.

Power
Not too bad for a V6.  If you buy a K&N Filter and remove the air intake silencer, it feels a little more gutsy.  I wish they put the dual exhaust on however...it misses the throaty sound of the GT.

Comfort
I drove it on an 8 hour trip and I have no complaints!  It was plenty comfortable

Styling
Much better since they squared it off.  Tougher looking.  I like it, especially in silver.

Sound system
Get the Mach 460.  That's really all I can say.  For stock?...it's awesome

Automatic tranmission
What are you kidding me??  Get a 5 speed.

Complaints
The cup holders are in a horrible place.  Not too much else to complain about for me.

Overall
Great car!  I love it but I should have invested in the GT (I like the sound of it)
