            <b>The BMW 7 Series has always been a very technologically advanced car. The model, beginning in the late 1970�s with the E23 733i was light years ahead of its time with computer engine management, which was uncommon at the time. The 1980�s saw the introduction of the sporty but plush E32. The mid 1990�s have brought us the E38 and finally we have the E65 7 Series. The BMW 7 Series is what I consider to be a luxury sports sedan. Throughout the years BMW has managed to give all the 7 Series a somewhat sporty undertone with their direct steering, stiffer suspension and racy engines.</b>

 Recently while getting my car serviced at BMW I noticed a new 7 Series demonstrator in the yard. I have heard numerous reports on the new car, both good and bad. Most of these reports had much to do with the new 7er�s controversial styling and I-Drive control system. After a lot of observation I decided to book in for a test-drive myself and see what the new car actually was like. The obliging salesman was most happy to take me out for a test drive then and there so I took him up on his offer. The 745Li pulled up and we were off.

<b>Styling</b>
The First thing that struck me with this new car was the fresh new styling. Auto journalists have ruthlessly mauled this car over the styling. George Bangle, BMW�s new engineer was responsible for this aspect of the car. The car I drove was in Sapphire Black, which complemented the car extremely well. From the front the car appears very vicious looking, even shark like. The indicators are above the lights making them seem like �eyebrows�. I think this looks good with the black but I saw a white model and it looked terrible. The famous �kidney� grille of BMW has been changed; it is now more rounded with simple black vertical barring and chrome surround. 

The side profile of the car further more conveys the sporting prowess with a simple flowing line. The rear pillar of the car is rather thick but it gives the car more of an imposing stance. Simple 10 spoke alloy wheels graced my car�s wheels although there were others to choose from. Now we come to the part that BMW has been most criticized for: The Rear. I will put it bluntly. The rear quarter panel is a cataclysm. It detracts from the whole streamlined shape of the car. The trunk lid is higher than the �profile line� and is lipped. It reminds me of a taxi�s rear end. Viewing the car from behind isn�t as bad but it still needs some sort of work for it to appeal to the majority of the market. However I believe you should make your own decisions as some of the photographs in the press don�t really complement the car. It is much better in the flesh.

<b>Interior and Features</b>
This is where I think the new 7 series really shines. The appearance of the interior can be described with two words: understated simplicity. The old E38 had often been criticized for having to many buttons. This car has done the opposite and has eliminated most of them with the new i-Drive. On entering the car the first thing you notice is the deletion of the gearshift in the console. I didn�t really like this idea and still don�t. As with most luxury sedans these days you have the capability of being able to shift through the gears as a clutchless manual. I prefer doing this than pressing little buttons on my steering wheel like in the new 7 series. The car is now divided into two sections. There is the comfort zone and the driving zone. The latter providing all the controls needed for driving. The dashboard has few buttons, the climate control system is now very simple, with the advanced controls being located in the i-Drive menus. The climate control system is quite sophisticated with dual front temperature zones. If you enjoy the sky then you will enjoy the standard sunroof with wide opening. The stereo is also a very simple affair with just a single CD slot.

The 745Li  gives an extra 140mm wheel base over the normal 745i which translates to very large rear seat leg room capacity. In both cars the front seat legroom is more than adequate.The trunk is quite large, 500 Liters.

The electrically adjustable seats are beautiful as usual. My car was fitted with the optional comfort seats, which I highly recommend. They are supportive in all the right spots and have the ability to not only heat, but massage and cool. The piece de resistance is the fact that they can be adjusted in 20 ways. The backrest, backrest length, cushion, cushion length, thigh support and lumber support are all adjustable. Admittedly BMW played catch up to Mercedes with the seats as the Mercedes were the first to invent the cooled seats. The controls for the seats are actually surprisingly easy to operate. The buttons for adjusting them are now on the front armrests versus being on the seat. I have a feeling BMW got their idea for the seat switches of Mercedes-Benz�s patented seat pictogram (small depiction of a seat that Mercedes uses for the adjustment of their seats whereby you push or pull the part of the depicted seat and your seats moves in conjunction with what you touched). BMW takes it a step further. You now select the part of the seat you want to adjust and then adjust the seat with a round knob nearby that can be pushed and twisted.  One thing that I have to say I like the most was the 7er�s very cushioned headrests (height and tilt adjustable). The rear seats are adjustable in 10 different ways, controlled in the same was as is the front.

The materials used on the interior are top notch. The dashboard had a very tasteful strip of warm colored wood grain veneer that was available in both high gloss and matte finishes. My car had �natural brown� colored leather, which complemented the black exterior so well. The leather was stitched to perfection and also covered the front armrest. The carpet was velour like and I suspect the floor mats were optional as they were beautifully manufactured and stitched. If there was one thing I didn�t like and that was the silver plastic inserts in the doors. They look good but somehow I think they will scratch. Also plastic inserts aren�t worthy of such an expensive car. Overall the interior ambience of the car is very good. I especially appreciated the LED lighting in the doors and foot wells that created a very warm feeling for me. The wood grain veneer made me think �Ikea� but the quality was a cut above. The cup holders (deemed imperative to the American market) are now state of the art. This car is much less airy than the previous model. I find it to be more like the E32 (1987-1994). The car is nowhere near as confining as a Jaguar but you still get the feeling that you are �driving something� rather than sitting on it.

i-Drive is the new system BMW uses for a variety of functions. It controls car stereo system and telephone, but also DVD navigation, the television, speech-controlled navigation system and on-board computer systems. A simple knob that can be used like a modified computer mouse in conjunction with the onboard monitor now controls all of this. The system is able to control over 700 different functions. In an attempt to try and keep your eyes on the road the i-Drive control provides feedback (not letting you select certain options, giving you an indents when controlling the balance for the stereo system just like on a real stereo). I found this all relatively simple to use although I wouldn�t recommend using the system at speed, just like you wouldn�t operate your GPS navigation at speed. However all is not rosy with the new 7. I have heard disastrous reports of the system locking up, freezing, deleting options etc. Already there has been a variety of software upgrades available to customers as well as replacement remote controls for the central locking. Some have even accused BMW of releasing the E65 7er too early and using the public as test Guinea Pigs. On a positive note, the superb sound system, which is controlled mostly via i-Drive included a 6-disc in-dash CD player, and 13 speakers. The result is great clarity and tone. I think it is better than Lexus� Mark Levinson system. An in-dash Mini Disc Player is optional.

The instruments and gauges are all highly legible and classily finished with silver surrounds. There are extensive LCD displays, which give easy to understand, legible instructions and useful information. The steering wheel combines a multitude of functions without the need of having to take your hands off the wheel as well as letting you change gears manually. The sophisticated voice activation features allow you to take shortcuts to almost every feature in the car. However I found the system often made mistakes. It may have been my accent. Simple tasks in the new 7er are now changed such as starting the car for example. You must first insert a stubby plastic fob into a special slot (the plastic fob is instead of the old key system), put your foot on the brake and then press another �start/stop button�. Sophisticated but also more time consuming. A couple of features that I did like however were the hill holding brakes which enabled you to take your foot off the brake while on a hill but prevented the car from rolling and the doors that did not slam shut on you and would keep open no matter what position. The car had �soft close� doors, which pulled the doors shut when they were ajar. The trunk lid was also electrically controlled in both opening and closing. BMW is also concerned with safety with no less than 10 airbags. An electrically controlled handbrake is also standard.

<b>Engine and Handling</b>
The BMW E65 7 Series sets new standards for engine efficiency, power and smoothness. The 745Li that I drove had a 4.4-liter V8 that I found to be very powerful considering it�s capacity. The Car is capable of 0-100km/h in 7 seconds. It felt more like 5. I think that is because of the new 7er having a 6-speed automatic developed by ZF. With the inclusion of that 6th gear the 1st gear really packs a punch now. There is a very smooth widespread of power which I found very useful, not only off the mark but also for overtaking and passing. 

The handling is absolutely superb for such a large car. I think most of this can be contributed to the tight chassis of the car as well as Dynamic Drive. Dynamic Drive is a sophisticated anti-roll control, which divides the front and rear roll bars into two. The halves are operated hydraulically according to information gathered by sensors around the car. When cornering the bar halves are turned opposingly to keep the body almost level. Without this system I don�t know how the car would handle but I will tell you that with the system if feels as if you can go around hairpins at 180km/h.

 However the BMW�s sporty intentions do let it down when it comes to unmade roads. The sportily tuned suspension, even though it is nowhere near as taut as that on sports cars suffers dearly on corrugated surfaces. That said, the 7er is still fine for every day driving, just don�t expect that gliding that you get out of some other cars. There are quite a few electronic aids that BMW uses for the new 7 series. Those include EDC-C (Electronic Damper Control), DSC (Dynamic Stability Control), ABS, Electronic Traction Control and Dynamic Traction Control. There are a few others also. 


<b>Final Evaluation</b>
The new BMW 7 series is an interesting car. It breaks many of the rules associated with luxury cars, namely ride and interior. However I believe that the interior is a real step forward and just needs some refining which will inevitably happen in the future. The rear styling however is unforgivable. You have to admire BMW for having the courage to bring such a modern and different product onto the market rather than stick with the crowds as many other makers. Such a product will always draw criticism as does anything that is �new� or �different�. 

In observation, I think that this BMW is much more overstated than previous models and that may not appeal to the traditional market. I know in Germany the model is really not selling so well but in America the sales figures seem to be very positive. BMW is trying to make it�s product more youthful which doesn�t really appeal to me but then again I do like an understated automobile. In closing, I would like to say that if you are looking for a luxury sports sedan then the BMW could quite possibly be your best choice. It provides the best of both worlds without really doing anything wrong. Just make sure you can live with the rear styling�
