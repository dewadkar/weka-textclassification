            Talk about a nobrainer. Ford has some pretty good stuff out there and Ford has been around for a long time as a leader in car productions. I bought my Ranger a year ago and is been a great, fast, sporty, trustworthy truck. I have just the basic stock 4 cyl, standard, anti-lock brakes, and A/C. You dont need more than this to be pleased with the car. But if you want speed, go for the Ranger Splash! They have a 4.0 L V-6 and they haul! Over all Rangers are one of the best compact pickups for the dollar. The one and only down side is they're just what they're called; compact. If you're tall or need some extra space for cargo, get an extended cab for sure because there is no room in a single cab. <br><br>
