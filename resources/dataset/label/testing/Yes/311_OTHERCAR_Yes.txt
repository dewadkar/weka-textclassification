            When the Nissan Xterra first came out onto the market, my boyfriend and I just knew this was the SUV for us.  We had watched the commercials, seen the ads, checked it out at our local dealership and then we bought one.  It was like a pure instinctive feeling telling us that we belonged in an Xterra.  

When it was named Motor Trend's Sport Utility Vehicle of the Year, we were not surprised.  We had already tested it and were quite sure of that fact.  Actually, we broke in our new SUV a bit harshly, if not somewhat foolishly.

It was the day after rains that had encompassed several days of thundering and heavy showers.  We had only had our Xterra a little over a week when we bravely (er, stupidly?) took it off the road this particular day.  A normally tame dirt road had turned into a fierce looking, unpredictable muddy mess.  Puddles of mud lay in the road, disguising the depths of the holes they filled.

At one point, as we drove into one of these puddles, the Xterra jerked forward much, much further than we expected and we started to slide into an even deeper hole at a dangerous angle.  We thought we were stuck.  It seemed as though if we tried to force our way out, we would tip the Xterra onto its side.

Unfortunately, since this was a spur of the moment trip, we came unprepared, leaving our cell phone at home.  No one knew where we were and it was miles to civilization.  So we crossed our fingers and chanced it.  Carefully, the Xterra rocked out of the slippery, deep hole without tipping over.  Whew!

But we could not cheer just yet.  We still had to find a safe point where we could turn around.  In addition, we came to realize that the muddy mess we had just precariously driven through was actually the only drivable area around us.  We would have to go back the way we came.

Luckily, our Xterra got us through.  When we stopped and got out to look at the most frightening sections of the road, we knew that had we been in any other SUV, we would have definitely been walking for help.

We absolutely love our Xterra!<br><br>
