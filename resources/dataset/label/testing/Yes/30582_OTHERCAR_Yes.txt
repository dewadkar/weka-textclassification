            You'll read great reviews of the new 1999 Odyssey here.  It sure looks like they've hit a home run with that model.  But what if you're a cheapskate like me and want a minivan that feels comfortable and makes you happy to drive, how about one of the 1995-1998 vintage Odyssey's that are a little smaller, a little less peppy, and a lot less expensive.  Honda hit a triple with them.

With two growing kids, we had been looking at minivans for a long time.  I'd rented the Windstar, the Caravan, driven my sister's Astro van, and her Mazda MPV.  I'd rank the Windstar highest, but none of these vans seemed easy to drive or carlike.  They drove like vans.  

While you won't mistake it for an Accord, the Odyssey drives like a car.  When our '83 Accord was totaled in a 1998 fender-bender (I told you I was a cheapskate!), we took the plunge and found a used 1995 EX with 60,000 miles for $16,200.  No doubt you'd do much better today.

For about half the cost of the new one, you get a terrific-handling, super-reliable van.  It could use a little more power, but the four-cylinder engine they cram under that tiny hood is definitely up to the task of hauling the family and a mess of camping gear up a mountain to a campsite.  And on nice flat interstates, it cruises at 80 nearly effortlessly.

Best feature: the magic back seat.  This saved us countless chiropractic bills when our 3-year-old daughter stepped on a ball, landed funny, and broke her femur.  She spent 6 weeks in a body cast.  Since she couldn't travel safely in a standard child's car seat, she now had to lie down on a seat, and we would feed the seat belts through a 7-point harness provided by the hospital for just this occasion.  Getting her in and out was tough, but it would have been nightmarish if I hadn't remembered the &quot;tailgate party&quot; feature of the magic seat -- with the turn of one dial, it flips back about 90 degrees, allowing us to lay her down, belt her in, and get her out all through the BACK of the car!  Once she was in, we just lifted the seat back up and it would click into position -- close the liftgate and we were off.  A real sanity-saver.  

Don't buy this car if you want to spend a lot of money on repairs, need to haul more than 6 (or 7 with the LX) people, or need to tow a big trailer or beat a Porsche off the line at a red light.  If you're looking for a high-quality, inexpensive van for a small family, this is it.<br><br>
