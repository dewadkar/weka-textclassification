            My husband bought this camera for me for Christmas.  I loved the camera until I ran out of disc space while at the &quot;Last Sunset of 2000&quot; in Key West.  Had I known the pictures would run out so quickly, I would have bought another Smart Media disc.  We have been everywhere to find the AC Power Adapter.  They are all on back order.  Still hoping to by it on internet.  The camera was easy to use and the size is great.  Hoping to get the power adapter soon.  Just read about the Floppy Disk Adapter and hope that will solve my problem of taking lots of pictures in Europe this summer.  When I get a larger SmartMedia card I will fill it up before leaving on a trip to see how many pictures I get.<br><br>
