            Few years ago, we were looking for a used family van, that wouldn't tax our budget and still was capable of hauling our family and stuff. After researching all available to me data, figured only two possibilities - Previa and Odyssey. Final decision came down to the price range - around 20K for used Odyssey vs. 12.5K for our Previa LE. After few years and 40K+ miles, that decision is not really regretted, but I am still thinking - maybe we could do slightly better.
  What we have: 95' Previa LE S/C, fully loaded except running boards and tape (CD only). There are dual A/C, leather, captain chairs in the middle row, ABS, rear spoiler and roof rack mounts.
 PROS: first, I like the way it looks - uncommon, clean and functional. Interior is extremely spacious relative to mid-size external dimensions, this van sits 6 people in good comfort, 7 in a pinch with some luggage. Seating is very flexible - rear split sits fold up to the walls in a minute - both or either one - no need to remove them. Minor disadvantage of captain chairs in the middle - they are permanently bolted to the floor. However, when it was really necessary (about 3 times in 4 years) I was able to easily unbolt them. Now, with experience, it takes me 5 minutes to undo a chair - but, they are HEAVY! Seats themselves are good, although not great. Leg and other space is outstanding.
 Driving: Never drove one without supercharger, and do not want - based on available info and my experience, it would not satisfy me. I like drive fast, when can and this van shows. Driving it, I was able to out-drive and out-accelerate many other cars, including so-called sporty variety from BMW and many other 6-cylinder automatics. Road handling in outstanding for such a big and heavy vehicle, and feels better than in many modern big sedans. Basically, the only place you really feel that it's top-heavy is curved highway ramps - slow down in advance! Brakes are very good when driving empty, but full load really taxes them.
 CONS (yes, there is a bunch!): Interior - due to mid-engine placement, inside is slightly noisier than even I would like during acceleration, although OK when going steady. Engine hump robs some space, although I am still able to use pass between the seats, but it requires some agility. After a while, engine warms up enough to transfer good deal of extra heat into cabin. That can be very helpful in the mid of winter, but not in summer, especially considering that A/C feels weak for this big cabin. Useful load capacity, especially for LE with all its extra things, is not big enough - we regularly overload it going on vacations. Results - tires suffer, unless you can safely over inflate them, and rear suspension kicks thru all too easily, sometimes delivering cruel bumps even on minor road irregularities.
 Driving: fuel consumption is not what I expected - in regular mixed driving is around 17 - 18 MPG using premium fuel, although on long trips, driving relatively slow on freeways, even with full load occasionally reached 20 - 21 MPG. For some people (like my wife) the van may still feel big, probably due to long wheelbase. At least once, she clipped another car driving out of the parking lot. Side visibility is awful, but wide angle glue-on mirrors made dramatic difference.
 Repairs (yes, it has to be repaired sometimes!): be aware of front accessories driveshaft problem. Due to mid-engine placement, accessories like alternator, steering pump, A/C pump, S/C, etc that are placed in front are driven by accessories driveshaft that utilizes rubber bushings. These tend to self-destruct about every 100K, and, according to Toyota, cannot be replaced separately. Whole shaft replacement cost me about $1300, and that's kind of job only shop can do. Recently, I observed variety of aftermarket replacement bushings advertised for sale, claiming that they can help fix that problem. I do have my doubts, knowing design and understanding working conditions of that thing. Also, when Toyota dealer replaced the shaft, they never offered me basic preventive repairs, that could be easily done at the same time - replacement of front seal and possibly water pump (strange, hah? They could make some money right away). I did not consider them, thinking of Toyota reliability. Well, nothing is ever as reliable as we wish. Now, I have strong suspicion that it's front seal that is leaking, but its replacement means taking off the accessories driveshaft, putting it back and adjusting again - about $400 labor! I added oil leak stop and waiting out to see how it goes now. Oil filter change is a pain. Otherwise, it is pretty reliable.
ALTERNATIVES: if you need all wheel drive, I do not see any good used alternative to this van, especially were winters actually bring snow. Drove 2wd into mountains, and do know for sure that AllTrack would be really helpful there.
Generally, it feels better suited to colder climates (see earlier notes). If all wheel drive is not critical, I would rather look at Odyssey.
 DX vs. LE: I maybe would rather take DX, which is less loaded but is much lighter, so I would expect better acceleration, load capacity, fuel economy and stability there, although 14" wheels might not be up to the task and probably should be replaced with 15" or 16" wheels, if there are any expectations of spirited driving. DX has bench seat in the middle that is removable, but not as comfortable as captain chairs. But, the main reason to buy LE was availability of ABS - could not find it on DX's. Although, I only needed it on snow - never kicked in on asphalt, even in the rain.
OVERALL: this is a very solid vehicle, one of the first to consider among used minivans. From what I know, second generation of them is still built in Japan and sold everywhere. Unfortunately, American market did not take them well, so now there is first generation Sienna, somewhat deficient overall to me. As to Previa, if bought smartly, it will deliver what you need - if that's what you need.
