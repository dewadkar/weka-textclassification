            Ford has truly mad a note worthy car this time. The only true complaint I have about this car is that there is not enough consideration took into it. I think partly because with a more serious engine it would stumble into the Mustang sells because of its price and with more variety it would actually edge off more of the slightly more expensive Focus' sales. It has the latest styling the best four cylinder on the market thanks to Cosworth and with the leather interior option and stiff suspension you might actually for get that you are not in a luxury/performance car. Your grandmas and your soccer moms might wanna think about the Focus,Civic or Cavalier something a bit more conservative; this car is for the high school kid or young adult with a little cash and adrenaline flowing through there veins.Ford has done it again! God bless
