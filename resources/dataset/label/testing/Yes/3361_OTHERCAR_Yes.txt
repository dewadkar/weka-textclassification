            OMG.
I can NOT believe it.
I actually bought a DATSUN???

Well, I have had Japanese cars in the past... two Subarus and two Toyotas, but a DATSUN (more fun to say than NISSAN)  Who knew!  When I landed my new job and could afford it, I decided to look for the status symbol of our time:  the sport-utility vehicle.  On the list?  Toyota 4Runner, Ford Explorer, Nissan Pathfinder, and Dodge Durango.

Drove the Explorer... hated it.  Unwieldy.
Drove the Durango.  Nice.  12mpg?  Ouch!  Horrible Safety and Reliability Ratings?  Case Closed.
Drove the 4Runner.  Now that's class.  V6? Good!.  17-20mpg?  Good!
$35,000?  Take a hike!
Drove the Pathfinder.  Uh Oh.
V6 with 240HP?  Nice!  4WD?  Nice!  18mpg city?  Nice!  Bose 6-disc in-dash CD Player?  Nice!  $30,000?  NICE!

It outclassed every American SUV in the price and size class, it outperformed the top-heavy 4Runner (top-heavy physically and on the pocketbook) and is as reliable and safe as they come.  Finally Nissan gets it right... a neat engine that hauls butt-ocks and is quiet as a fly burping 3 miles away and is just a joy to drive.

I recommend the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder to anyone looking at comparable mid-size SUVs.  They're decent on gas, excellent on power, reasonably priced for the amount of options you can get standard, and just a great bargain.
