            <b>{ANNOUNCER:}
LLLLLADIES AND GENTLEMEN! Welcome to this evening's main event! In this contest, the Ford Mustang and the Chevrolet Camaro will square off in the Detroit Battle of the Pony Cars! Who will be our champion?</b>

BOB: I'm not gonna sugar-coat this one, Chuck. This should be the toughest comparison we have seen yet.

CHUCK: Absolutely, Bob. This place is sold out and ready to watch this age-old classic war rage on. In many ways, I see it more as a grudge match, since the Camaro and the Firebird will be ceasing production soon due to decreasing sales.  

BOB: That's really too bad. General Motors, if you're watching, we're mad at you!

CHUCK: Take it easy, Bob. Let's get started!

<b>[EXTERIOR:  Chevy Camaro]</b>
BOB: Personally, we feel that the Chevy Camaro just looks the part of a muscle car better, especially its higher trim levels. This is not to say we don't find the Mustang attractive. Quite the contrary. 

CHUCK: And we would hardly consider the Camaro's exterior to be more user-friendly than the Mustang. But you want a muscle car to look <i>mean</i>, and we feel the Camaro bares its teeth more than the Mustang does.

<b>[INTERIOR:  Ford Mustang]</b>
BOB: I can't say I'm crazy about either interior. Both give me that nasty plasticky feeling. But in the end I would pick the Mustang. It has more passenger room, and more room in the back seat than the Camaro. The Camaro's sound system is far superior to the Mustang's in our opinion, but that's about it. You can't even see the front end of the Camaro, and the rear-view mirrors are tiny. That would take some getting used to.

CHUCK: Yep. The Camaro just gave us an overall cramped feeling. I did, for one, like the dash of the Camaro better, however. The Mustang's is just as clean and functional but not as aesthetically pleasing. Still, the seats are just way too low on the Camaro, and getting in and out is a chore. To the Camaro's credit, I would say that Chevy succeeded in having the more &quot;car enthusiast&quot; interior- such drivers don't care about these trivialities, do they?

BOB: Call us wimps then, because we prefer the friendlier Mustang interior.

<b>[ENGINE: Chevy Camaro]</b>
BOB: I gotta tell ya, Chuck- when it comes to the &quot;most go for your dough,&quot; the Camaro has the Mustang's number... The 0-60 numbers are very close for the base engines, but we picked the Camaro's engine for its low-rpm thrust, smoother delivery, and excellent response timing. Again, this was still a close call for us.

CHUCK: That's right. The Mustang's engine saw an incredible power boost for 1999, which narrowed the gap considerably between these two cars. The powerful Mustang GT received power gains too, up to 260hp. The base Camaro wouldn't stand a chance against the GT, but the 305hp Camaro Z28 (direct competitor for the GT), would give it a swift spanking. Only the Mustang SVT Cobra can compete with the likes of the Z28... but then an SS would be a more appropriate comparison.

BOB: You know, had Ford not dropped its 5.0L V8 of old, it would fare much better in a competitive comparison. As far as our base model comparison, we feel that the comparison is closer than ever before, but the Camaro still comes out on top.

CHUCK: But let's not kid ourselves... even the Camaro SS (320hp) is only a <i>little</i> bit faster than the Mustang GT- according to Car &amp; Driver, it's only half a second faster in the quarter mile. When it comes to buying, I see the $4,200 advantage of the Mustang GT over the Camaro SS over any other stat. So you're right, Bob. When it comes down to money, this comparison is not quite as easy as it seems.

<b>[RIDE: Ford Mustang]</b>
BOB: We found the ride of the Mustang to be more compliant than the Camaro. Its suspension was one of the major updates for 1999... the Camaro still uses its rather dated rear live-axle suspension. The fact that it was noiser in the Camaro (road noise, tire noise) than in the Mustang didn't help things much, either.

CHUCK: I personally prefer exhaust note of the Camaro's engine to the Mustang's, but that's really it. The Mustang just makes a better compromise between handling and ride quality.

<b>[HANDLING: Chevy Camaro, in a nail biter]</b>
BOB: Yikes this comparison is tough so far!

CHUCK: I'm with you, Bob. <i>Every</i> category has been close.

BOB: Well, the Camaro came out on top in the handling category. Its tires hold well during moderate or even sharp turns. And since it is so low to the ground, you get almost no body lean at all. I liked how the Camaro practically anticipated our every move. 

CHUCK: But it wasn't as one-sided as you would think... the Mustang's brakes were improved for 1999, and we felt that they were superior to the Camaro's during our test. Further research confirmed that the Mustang takes four less feet to stop from 60-0 than the Camaro does. In addition, I think the Mustang has an edge in its steering. But not enough to win this round...

<b>[RELIABILITY: TIE]</b>
BOB: Both reliabilities are listed as average. Dealers are both accessed easily. Neither one gains much ground on the other in customer satisfaction either.

CHUCK: And the warranties are essentially the same, minus a little discrepancy in corrosion coverage... not enough to get a winner here.

BOB: Wheeee... moving on...

<b>[VALUE:  Chevy Camaro]</b>
BOB:  If what you want is rear-wheel MUSCLE then the Camaro is the better value for you. It comes with many important standard features, such as ABS which is optional on the Mustang. In addition, it gives you stronger engine performance and an overall sportier... feel, let's say. And even though the Mustang closed the gap considerably by improving its power, we have to hand it to Chevrolet for providing us with the choice of the Camaro Z28, which is arguably one of the best sports car buys out there.

CHUCK: Bear in mind that &quot;better value&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;better car&quot; or &quot;smarter buy.&quot; The Mustang GT package, for example, comes in with more features than the Camaro Z28, and even a smidgen cheaper. But it still has 45 fewer horses than the Z28, which is a significant edge in favor of the Camaro.

<b>[WINNER:  FORD MUSTANG, IN A SURPRISING DECISION!]</b>
BOB: Now we've really fallen off the rocker! The Camaro won by a vote of 4-2, and yet we still picked the Mustang as the winner! What's going on?

CHUCK: Simple. The Chevrolet Camaro performed better in our road test comparison. However, <i>we felt that the Ford Mustang had a better <b>balance</b> of race-track qualities and everday functionality than the Camaro</i> did. For all of you faithful Camaro worshippers, you should be happy with the outcome of our test because we assume that you could care less about everyday functionality. For you, we assume that it all comes down to the race-track qualities... and believe us, the Camaro won't disappoint.

BOB: But our vote shouldn't come as much of a surprise, either... This is exactly the same kind of vote that is cast by the majority of your dollars: the Ford Mustang outsells the Camaro and Firebird twins <i>combined</i> by a margin of <i>2 to 1!</i> And the fact that the Camaro and the Firebird are soon to be cut from production because of this only further accentuates our point.

CHUCK: So before you choose which of these two cars you prefer, take a good look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself what it is you want. Seriously- do it... we had to! Thanks for reading. That does it for us. Good night out there.

BOB: Join us next time for our next feature: AM General Hummer takes on a mule in the back country!

<i>[Note: I drove both of the base models cars extensively for a period of two days, and therefore recognize that this comparison is better suited for decisions between those trims. Whether or not you found this review helpful/entertaining, drop me a line!]</i><br><br>
