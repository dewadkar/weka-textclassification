            First, I will point out the obvious: it is a great looking car.  Nothing too flashy, but nice none the less.  It is great for around town, and for long drives, if you are the long distance driving type.  It is really comfy and roomy, and the kids won't complain TOO much about squished legs or their sibling invading their personal space.  It gets great gas mileage, and I have never had a repair problem or any sort of malfunction.

Honda's also have great resale value, but I doubt you would ever need to get rid of the car.  Unless you have some midlife crisis and feel the need to go out and buy something overpriced and unpractical, like a cherry red Corvette.  Otherwise, this is a car well worth holding onto, and I assure you you will get a LOT of use out of it.

The downside:  parts can get pricey.  And if you are going for different, this is not the car for you.  I guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will have one too (which goes to show how LOVED they are, right?)<br><br>
