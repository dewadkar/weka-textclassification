            The Chevy Malibu is a terrific car. I have owned one since 1997 and I have never been happier with a car. The braking system is excellent. I have yet to find a problem with the brakes on my Malibu ( unlike other cars I have owned.)  The Malibu steers well too, which is a wonderful advantage up here in the &quot;Great White North.&quot; There are a few problems of course: there have been a few wiring problems with the lights - causing the engine warning light to come on periodically. This can be frightening, especially at 2 am on a dark deserted highway. Other than that, I have no complaints about the Chevrolet Malibu <br><br>
