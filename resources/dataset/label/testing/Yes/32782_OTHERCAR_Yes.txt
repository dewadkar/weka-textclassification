            I don�t go by Motor Head for nothing.  I have very few gray areas in my life and sports cars are not one of them.  I guess I should warn you that if you want to get the most value out of this review, you really should read my (or most others) reviews of a 95 or 96 Corvette.  You really need to know about a C-4 before you read this review.  Of course I�ll educate you regarding the differences along the way.

Unlike previous reviews where I have started with the downsides first, I�m going to give you the good stuff first.  I�ve wanted a Corvette convertible for a long, long time.  I finally had the means to do so without sacrificing.  I didn�t buy a new Corvette.  That�s mostly why I decided to review a car I thoroughly test drove and then didn�t buy.  The whopping $54,000 price tag for a rag top wasn�t the show stopper.  I bought my Corvette convertible.  BUT,  I bought a very low mileage 95;  In other words and old body style Corvette.  Ok, I know, I said the good stuff first so here goes.

The new drop-top Corvette is drop-dead gorgeous.  I mean just absolutely stunning.  The touches of 57-62 Corvette styling are wonderfully brought back to fashion, right down to the passenger grab bar.  The coupe doesn�t reflect as much of the retro-style as the convertible.  With the convertible model you get that wonderful seamless feel because the interior and exterior flow right into each other.  In the early years this was a Corvette trademark.  I really enjoy all the car makers revisiting the early designs that made them famous.  Everyone�s in the retro-style business and I couldn�t be happier.  The melding of new technology and the grace of early year styling is just spectacular, especially on the new Corvette.

The acceleration is neck-snapping, as it should be.  The handling is crisp and precise as it should be.  The 6 speed tranny is terrific.  5th and 6th are both overdrive gears.  80 mph is just under 2K on the tach, or just a little over idle if you prefer.  A sharp down shift from 6th to 3rd at highway speeds and you blow the doors off of pretty much anybody you want.  Matching Corvette performance takes an order of magnitude higher spending, and that�s one of Corvette�s most endearing features.

I went with an automatic on my �Vette, and that was my only sacrifice to practicality.  My 95 is my daily driver and I find that the 4 speed automatic isn�t really the sacrifice I imagined it might be.  As a 4 speed the automatic is one of the truly �shiftable� automatics and I don�t regret the choice.  This is continued in the C-5 Corvette.

All this being said, why didn�t I buy one?  This is a Corvette imposter!  Yessiree Bob.  Right down to it�s parts bin manufacturing.  This Corvette has lost it�s soul in my humble opinion.  Chevy had a good idea alright.  Limiting the Corvette unique parts to a minimum is ok.  We the consumer don�t see the savings though.  The car comes optioned to the hilt.  It�s practically impossible to find one that doesn�t have automatic everything.  My 95 is optioned out too, but the HUD (heads up display) on the new Corvette is just too much.  A HUD belongs right where it started, on a fighter jet.  

For those of you fortunate enough to have had real driver�s education, you know that you are supposed to scan your mirrors, your gauges and the ROAD.  A HUD in a car invariably focuses your attention on the windshield and not three cars ahead where it�s supposed to be.  There are no enemy fighters to target on the highway as yet.  Enemy drivers, maybe, but I think it�s still illegal to blow them up.

The C-5 is just a little too polite in the handling area.  There is noticeable body roll in a hard corner.  Chevy says the C-5 out-handles the C-4, but don�t you believe it.  The anti-idiot driving computer will certainly help a lot of wealthy fools avoid wrapping the car around something or someone, but you can keep it as far as I�m concerned.  ABS, ok,  I don�t need it because I grew up in snow country and learned to pump the brakes and steer through the obstacle.  Exactly what ABS does, but for people who don�t take driving as seriously as other enthusiasts.  Throttle reduction?  OK, saves a bundle on the costly tires, but try and modulate the throttle for maximum acceleration.  Yeah, you can turn it off, but it kind of peeves me that it�s on there to begin with.  A lot of the price tag is in the technology that compensates for sloppy driving.

The C-5 handles bumpy roads better without a doubt.  The C-4 let�s you feel every ripple and a lot of people don�t like that.  I�ll take more feedback than less any day.  May I remind you that Corvette drivers screamed bloody murder for a better handling car.  The C-4 gave them a car in 1984, a full 16 years ago, that could exceed 1 G in the corners.  What do they do? Gripe about the ride.  Now I know that I probably having a lot of people frothing at the mouth with anger right about now, so I give you this,  In the early years, the C-4 had more than it�s share of problems.  Warped interior panels, fading and peeling paint, funny noises, fit and finish problems, the list goes on.  But the heart and soul of Corvette was there.  Performance!  If you buy a 94,5 or 6 you get the top of the development curve.  It�s always been that way with Corvette.  The C-4 had one of the longest production runs in Corvette history.  The C-6 is coming out in a couple of years, meaning the C-5 will have one of the shortest production runs.  Only the original Polo Corvette had shorter.

All that being said the numero uno, biggest thing I detest about the C-5 is the hood.  The C-4 brought one of the most spectacular design features ever in Corvette history.  The Clamshell hood.  Previously you had to buy a Ferrari or classic Jaguar to get complete access to the inner workings.  To this day, the open hood of a clean, well kept C-4 is a breathtaking sight.  A finely detailed engine shines like a work of art.  The Formula 1 fashion �Corvette only� suspension was laid out in all of it�s cast aluminum glory.  People hadn�t been so proud to lift the hood since the glory days of the late 60�s.  The hood on the C-5 works just like the hood on a Toyota Corolla.  How anti-climactic can you get?

Now, if you really want a C-5, by all means, buy one. It really is a great sports car.  It doesn�t lack for style or performance.  It�s well built with top-notch fit and finish, but so was the 95 and 96 C-4.  It is reputed to be very reliable, but so is my 95.  The only thing missing is the Corvette Soul.
