            We are leasing our Silhouette and love it so far.  We love the power sliding door makes entry and exit for the kids a breeze when dropping and picking them up at school.  The interior is roomy and comfortable and the van was priced very good. We compared to many different mini vans and really picked the Silhouette because of the value for the money, you got more options for less money on comparable mini vans.  Also the entire inside is not plastic toggle switches like several that we looked at. We would recommend this to anyone with children who needs room to haul their gear and friends etc.
