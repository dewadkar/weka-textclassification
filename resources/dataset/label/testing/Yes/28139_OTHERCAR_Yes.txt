            The only reason my husband and I wanted a digital camera is because he is in the military and gone a lot. Currently he is in Bosnia for five months. We have a two year old daughter whom he does not get to see much of. We thought the camera would be a great way to enable him to see her grow up, even if it is through pictures. The camera is great. We have a Polaroid PDC 700. The picture quality is wonderful. It is very easy to use and very easy to link to your pc. The accompanying software that comes with the camera allows you to do the most creative things with your pictures. You can create postcards, greeting cards, or make a fantasy come true by placing yourself in a variety of pictures from the gallery. For example, you can make a picture of yourself at the Grand Canyon. This camera is sufficient for all of your personal digital needs. We love ours. It was one of the best investments that we've ever made. I recommend this camera to anyone who is considering a high quality digital camera. <br><br>
