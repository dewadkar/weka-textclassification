            I must admit, this was my first car that my father helped me purchase after high school.  I still own this little beauty to this day.  I purchased it in 1993 new and it is still going strong.  Although there have been little things go wrong with it, but only like interior problems (stereo buttons coming loose, etc.) I had a problem with the seat belts about 4 years into my ownership with it but thank goodness that the seat belt warranty that came with this car was excellent, as it carried 4 years over the purchase date.  Okay so I will admit it is not a show case car right now as my baby has been through her share of trips, but it has been such a good car to me and my husband and our little 2 year old toddler that she also hauls around.  Even though the back seats look small they are quite comfy to be honest, and the front seats are just very comfy for it being a sports like car. I would only recommend this type and size of car for a single person or maybe a student.  It did live up to all the expectations I had of it and then some as it has survived 7 years for me! I bought this car not only for it's nice appearance but also how well it was put together on the interior and exterior of the car. Highly recommended for single people or students, 2 thumbs up for Mazda!
