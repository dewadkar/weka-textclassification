            I purchased my Ram 250 cargo van back in 1994. It now has 85,000 miles on it and is still running like a charm. In five years of mostly city driving and not being the best at preventive maintenance I've only needed three repairs. They were a fuel pump, a starter and a brake job.

     I bought the truck to do deliveries for my mall furniture store. I found parking and maneuvering around city traffic to be a breeze. It also amazes me at how much freight it will hold. Once I did a delivery of sixteen small chest of drawers with no problem.

     I'm now out of the business but I keep my van as a source of reliable transportation.<br><br>
