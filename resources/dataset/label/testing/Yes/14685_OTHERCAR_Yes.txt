            When I got my 1999 Forester in June of 1999, I was looking for a four-wheel drive vehicle that would be good on snowy or wet roads and an occasional trip onto well-groomed dirt roads. I did not want a large SUV as I did not want a truck-like ride and wanted a vehicle that got good gas mileage.

I got the Forester L model. When I compared the L and S models, the only difference between the two that was of any significance is that the S model has four-wheel disk brakes. I would have liked those instead of the front disk/rear drum that the L model has but there was a $3,000 price difference and the disk brakes were not worth that much to me. I have not regretted that decision.

The Forester has a very good ride and handles quite well. The first week I had it, I was driving down I-95 in Delaware and a woman entered the road from an on-ramp and started to pull into my lane. I was able to quickly evade her without the feeling that I was going to tip over and I remained in control of the Forester the entire time. I don't believe that a truck-based large SUV would have given me the same control.

There is a lot of cargo space, particularly with the rear seats folded flat. I have also carried 4x8 sheets of plywood on the roof.

I now have 36,000 miles on this car and have had only one problem: a bad set of spark plug wires that caused the car to stumble under acceleration. The dealer replaced the wires under warranty and all is well now. I consistently get between 22 and 25 miles per gallon from regular gasoline.

The all-wheel drive system works very well under heavy rain and snow conditions. It also works well on dirt roads, though I suspect that performance would be improved if I switched to a more aggressive tire than the standard tire provided by Subaru.

The Forester is not suitable for heavy off-road use, so if you are looking to drive through the mountains, look elsewhere for a truck-based SUV.

I choose the Forester because I wanted a practical, all-wheel drive vehicle that provided me with good gas mileage, a comfortable ride, and a large degree of utility. It has been a very good choice for me and I plan on buying this vehicle when my lease expires next year.
