            The Saturn SL is a dream car, it's amazing to find a car so well built this day and age. Many people had told me about their wonderful experiences with the Saturn company and I was skeptical at first but that soon changed. Although the car is small somehow it seems incredibly roomy when you get in. It has an incredibly spacious trunk, when I first got it we fit two of my girlfriends and myself in there. 
The Saturn is remarkably easy to drive, it handles very well. It is an extremely affordable &quot;luxury&quot; car. It gets reasonable gas mileage. Honestly, I can not find anything which I do not like about the car. The employees at Saturn are also very helpful. I'm not sure I will purchase another type of car in the future as I can't imagine the let down after this.<br><br>
