            At least that is what I refer to it as:) Back when my ex husband and I were looking to purchase a vehicle we both wanted different things. He wanted a 2 door manual and I wanted a 4 door automatic. This little 4 door manual '96 Metro (4 Cylinder)was the compromise.

Pros:
Being only 5'2&quot; myself this car, though small, is wonderful for me. I can sit in the driver's seat and unlock the passenger side door, don't have to climb up to get into the car and the best part of all is that I can reach the pedals without having to have the seat crammed up to its most forward position to do so! (for all you fellow vertically challenged people out there, you know what I mean)

The seats are comfortable and there is decent leg room for a small car. Maintaining this car is easy and it gets great gas mileage on the highway. As for long trips, it was driven from Austin, TX up to Nebraska then down to Georgia then back to Austin in the span of about 8 weeks and did wonderfully.

Cons:
This biggest cons come if you are a large/tall person. A friend of mine is 6'3&quot; and occasionally drives my car. With the seat all the way pushed back his knees are still up near the steering wheel though he has no trouble what-so-ever reaching any controls. Also the tiny clutch, brake and gas pedals are a challenge for his size 14 feet. I joke with him and say that if he can't find the brake he could just put those &quot;boats&quot; of his outside the car and stop it like the Flintstones(at less than 2000 LBS worth of car it just might work).

Basically this is a great car if you want a practical, reasonably priced small car that gets great mileage and with low cost up keep. As for comfort, you may want to just go down and test drive one to see how your dimensions and the dimensions of the car coincide.<br><br>
