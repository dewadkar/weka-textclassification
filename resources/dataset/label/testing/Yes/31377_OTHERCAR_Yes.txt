            Oldsmobile has often meant OLDpersonsMOBILE.  Not the Alero. The Alero I had for the week was the coupe, 5-speed with the 2.3L 4 cylinder engine.

This car turns heads.  It looks great. Many people commented on the car's styling.  Mine was red with really cool 5-spoke wheels, a rear spoiler and driving lights.  I just looks very sporty and fast.

The 4 cylinder engine only produces 150 hp (Honda Civic Si = 160 hp, Dodge Neon = 150 hp Solara 4cyl = 135 hp), but it feels like more thanks in part to the 5-speed manual transmission. You can opt for a V-6, but with gas prices climbing to near $2.00 per gallon, the 4 has plenty of power, and won't break the bank at the filling station. Although the engine is not the smoothest ever, it seems to get smoother the higher you rev it.  Also engine noise is not bad considering the high rpm's I was often running.  

The 5-speed gears were comfortable for city driving, no hunting for the right gear.  The engine produced enough torque (155 @ 4400rpm) so that you can leave the car in 2nd or 3rd gear during most urban and suburban traffic.  This is a big plus if you want to shift your own gears - all the fun without the hassle of constantly rowing the shifter between 1st and 2nd gear.  The clutch has a nice light feel which almost encouraged quick shifts.  Simply put - it's fun.

Inside the Alero is rather sparse, I had  the GL model.  Remember the Alero is Oldsmobile's lower line car.  Even though Oldsmobile wants you to compare the Alero to an Accord Coupe, the truth is, a Civic is priced more like an Alero.  However for a Civic price, Oldsmobile gives you a car the SIZE of an Accord. It's all about value.  Expect 4 adults to ride comfortably, but like most coupes, getting in and out of the back seat is not pretty.  The front seatbelts make it difficult to get in and out of the back. If you're buying a coupe, chances are you have young friends - they can handle it. Once in, the back seats are plenty roomy.  The comfort of the seats (front and back) is OK.  Not bad - not great, just OK. There is plenty of trunk room, and the split folding rear seats help add extra space should you need it. The Stereo is average.

Handling is excellent.  This car feels very light and therefore is fun to toss around corners.  As a result the ride is a little on the hard side, not terribly so, but just more harsh than average. You will feel most bumps in the road, but not in a bad way.  The firm ride encourages spirited driving in that you feel more in tune with, or connected to the road.  Also steering feel and response is very good. The brakes have excellent firmness and feel VERY reassuring.

All said, this is not a luxury car. It does not pretend to be a luxury car. The Alero is, however, fun to drive.  You get a lot of standard features like traction control and ABS for a price the Japanese imports can only dream of.  

                        *******************************
After a week of driving the Alero - Here are two minor complaints. 1)  I love that the car comes with a CD player, but why are there no storage spaces big enough to hold CD's? 2) The manual trans. must be shifted into reverse before the key can be removed - the placement of the hand brake makes this difficult.<br><br>
