            What a great car this is. It has the look of the forties but the drive of the ninetys or shall I say zero's. Chrysler has finally came up with a unique car that will turn heads on streets in every state. The car comes in many different colors such as a sizzlin silver, a radical red, and other great colors. You can even get a pinstripe of a color on top of the coating which makes it look snazzy! The seats are very comfortable, they are so comfortable you can live in them.

The airconditioning works perfectly in the back, it reaches to the back seats with full blow. You can fit five people in this car. It is a family car. Everyone turns their head on the street wishing it was their car. You get tons of people wanting you to put down your window, to ask how much it is, where did you get it, how do you like it, and tons more.
The only thing I don't like about this vehicle is that it doesn't have a full boost of speed when you press down on the gas pedal, this isn't a problem for others though. Rumors has it that they are coming out with a PT Cruiser Turbo in a year. This is a great family car, and its a great buy for the money.. believe me!
