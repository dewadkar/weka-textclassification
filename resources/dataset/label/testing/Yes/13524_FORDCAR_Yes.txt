            I purchased a brand new 1999 Ford Explorer XLT 4X4 in March of 1999, here in Germany (i am in the US military )without even driving one before!!!! Some people call me crazy,(spending 33,000) but that is how much research I did on the vehicle before I purchased it.  It is beautiful. Medium wedgewood blue, with 16&quot; tires with white letter Firestones. It has privacy glass and is loaded. Power everything. Minus Sunroof. Dual airbags. 
 Ford really did a number on this thing in 1999. They came out with an absolutely excellent engine, the 4.0 Liter 210HP SOCH V-6. I am a hard core FORD finatic, and I am a V-8 Type, but the option of the AWD only with the V-8 turned me off. The 4.0 SOHC comes with automatic 4WD, it only comes on when you need it, or you can lock it in low range, or high range. I believe that that is not an option on the AWD version. Their is no Low range 4wd on the AWD. I did not want AWD, and the 302 is an awesome engine, but it is a pushrod engine, and the fuel economy wasnt as good. The HP was only 5 hp more and the torque was only about 40ft/lbs more. Nothing to really write home to mom about. But the responsiveness of that 4.o SOHC is outstanding. My mother has a 93 explorer with the pushrod 4.0 rated @ 160 hp, and there is no comparison. I live here in Germany and I can drive that thing @ 90 mph all day long and still get 18-20 MPG. I kid you not.  I was absolutely amazed also. But the pump doesn't lie, especially with the outrageous gas prices now. The noise level at 90 mph is very minimal, especially for such a big vehicle with radial tires of that size. I can talk to my wife at normal tones with ease. At 55mph for you stateside folks, it is very quiet. 
       I have over 25,000 miles on it now without incident. Not one problem whatsoever. I have a 2 yr old daughter and I feel so good about her being in this vehicle and I feel that she is safe in it. 
     The warranty on it is superb also. I purchased an extended warranty for it for about 1,000.00. It is a 75,000 or 7 yr warranty !!!!BUMPER TO BUMPER!!!!. I could drive it until it was payed off and not have to stick any money into it for repairs (minus oil changes, tires, and brakes). 
    It has keyless entry on it and that is outstanding also. I love it and I dont have to worry about locking the keys in the vehicle while my daughter is in it. Or even if she locks the doors I can open it immediately. The panic button works quite well also. It gets the point across to people to get away from the vehicle( just to mess with them). But if I had to use it it is there. And it is quite loud and annoying. Another awesome feature that I love about it is, in the rear hatch area, there is a switch by the drivers rear window that unlocks and locks the doors. So when you open the rear door and unload your items, you dont even have to go to the front to lock the doors, it is right there for your convenience!! And one other little cool thing is the puddle lamps. They are little lamps in the bottoms of each side mirror. When you use the remote opener to open the vehicle, the lights turn on , so that you dont walk into a water puddle at night. And also for added safety, it adds alot of light to the underside of the vehicle, so you could see possible threats under the vehicle.
   The list of++++++++'s goes on and on. But there is only one con to this truck. If you ever have the unfortunate job of changing oil in it, you will know what I am talking about. When you pull out the drain plug, the oil immediately hits the frame and then runs down the inside of the frame, for a reall nice mess to clean up. I did it the first time on a drive on hoist (type that you drive on, without lift points) and pulled the plug, boy was that a mistake. i had about 4 qts of oil allover the tire,  lower A frame, and on the hoist platform. I never did that again that is for sure. If Ford would have put the plug in the front of the pan, this whole thing would have been avoided. 
   I would buy another one blindfolded. I trust Ford and I trust 500,000 Americans a year that purchase them also. Not all 500,000 people can be crazy, can they?<br><br>
