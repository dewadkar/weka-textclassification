            We have a 1995 Dodge Ram that was purchased used in March of 1997.  My husband wanted a big truck because he had driven a small truck for about ten years.  The Dodge had about 20,000 miles on it when we bought it and it had been a leased truck.  It is a very nice, manly looking truck.  The seats are comfortable.  I am very short so I find it hard to drive and even harder to park.  The good thing is that it does turn sharp.  When I drive it, I seem to drive too far to the right.  The air conditioning went out about two years ago and we had it recharged twice and now it seems to be working fine but we are not sure why???  It has been a very reliable truck and we have not had any major repairs.  My husband really likes this truck but he is planning on getting another kind next time.  <br><br>
