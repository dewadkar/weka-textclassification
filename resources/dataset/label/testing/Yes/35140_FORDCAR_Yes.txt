            In my quest for my next daily driver, I've been test driving a handful of different cars before I commit to buying one. This is my initial impression of the Escort ZX2.

<b>Interior</b>

This car easily meets my most important criterion for the interior: I've got to fit in it comfortably. At 6'2", I don't fit very well into some of the compact cars on the market today. The rest of the interior is relatively unremarkable. Nothing that'll give you any illusions you're sitting in anything other than a cheap compact, but nothing was loose, damaged, or got in my way.  Nothing outstanding, but nothing that would make me take points away from it either.

<b>Engine</b>

It's hard to believe the Zetec motor in the Escort is the same one that motivates the Focus, which I also test drove. Perhaps Ford made some subtle changes to the engine for the Focus, or maybe the Focus's chassis does a better job of insulating the driver from engine noise, but you'd never guess that this is the same power plant from the way it feels. The engine in the Escort is louder, more raucous, and it felt like it just wanted to be revved (a point the salesman considered open to dispute). It gives the little Escort plenty of zip, enough to generate some respectable quarter mile times for an economy car (although I'm sure the salesman would have pitched a fit if I had decided to personally verify those). The only possible downside, although whether it's a downside could depend on your point of view, is that the engine is loud and feels somewhat unrefined. You're not going to mistake it for a Honda Civic here.

<b>Handling</b>

I didn't get a chance to really put it through the twisties, but this car feels like a very competent handler. It feels very sure-footed and doesn't have any nasty little quirks that I observed. This car gives you the feeling that it wouldn't be a bad choice to equip with R-compound tires and head to the local autocross, although I'm not sure how well it would do there. But it would be fun to find out.  At the same time, the ride is not unduly harsh or rattly. There's nothing about this that would make the driver feel uncomfortable here.

<b>Other notes</b>

As this is just a test drive, there's not much I can say about what I've seen of this car's fuel economy, reliability or cost of maintenance. However, I've usually heard that Escorts can do pretty well in those respects. There isn't anything I've heard about in these areas that would make me want to avoid it.

<b>The verdict</b>

The Escort is definitely a fun little car. It offers lots of performance in a small, economical package while still letting big guys like me drive it. While I haven't decided what car I should buy, people shopping for a sport compact should not overlook this little coupe.
