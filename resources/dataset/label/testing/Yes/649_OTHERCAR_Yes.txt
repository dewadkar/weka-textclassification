            I actually bought this camera after a recommendation from my brother (and trying out his 950). I was thinking of getting a digital camera to supplement my Nikon 35MM, which I haven't used much since my 950 purchase.

The swivel lense comes in very handy. Great for shooting from the waist (literally) and get candid photos, while still composing shots. You would also be able to hold the camera over crowds and still compose the shot as well.

The resolution is excellent. I was able to plug my CF card into an HP P1100 and print a very good quality 8x10. I am able to take a high resolution picture, then take a low resolution picture right after. The low res (640x480) maximum resolution picture is usually around 40 kilobytes, which is great for web posting and email. My friends were astounded by the quality of the pics, even before I pointed out it was set for the worst quality. The threaded lense is a plus , so you can add attachments, ie add on lenses and filters.

Great for a beginner. You can learn composition, lighting, ect without expensive film costs. 

There are a few annoyances with this camera. One for me is the plastic threaded tripod mount (990 is metal), which means careful handling when mounting to tripod/monopod/external flash bracket so as not to strip the threads. Would have been better to have CF card door on the side instead of bottom (990 does now), so you don't have to remove it from tri/monopod/bracket when you have to remove/swap CF cards, which amplifies annoyance/worry. 

Too slow for most action photography, but that's most digital cameras in general.


A few things I would recommend:
1. A larger CF card. You can get a 64MB card for around $140.

2. External flash and bracket. Reduces redeye, and eliminates flash problems when using add on lenses/filters. I have an old Sunpak 344D as well as my Nikon SB24. Both flashes have swivel/bounce/zoom heads for greater flash control.

3. A card reader for your computer. I have a Sandisk USB  card reader. Windows just sees it as a removeable drive, like a Zip drive.

5. A few sets of nimh (nickel metal hydride) batteries. I have several sets of batteries. Each set is a different color (Samsonites are grey, Digipower are yellow/black or green). That way I can differentiate the sets, since each set is charged separately and I know which set is un/used. You should have at least 2 sets.

6. If you end up taking a lot of pictures, a CDR/RW will become indispensable.

7. A good photo printer to show off your work.

8. A nice small camera bag to hold your stuff.

9. A wide angle and a telephoto lense.

10. Filters.  

11. A monopod and/or tripod for low light and difficult shots.

12. A cheap laptop with decent storage if you are going to be away for an extended time. I have seen used/old P100 laptops with a 2 gig drive for around $300 at the last computer show.<br><br>
