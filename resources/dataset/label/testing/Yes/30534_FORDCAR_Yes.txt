            A 1992 Blue Escort LX sedan was my first car when I got my licence. It wasn't an eye opener except for superficial types who opened their eyes only to spare, point, then laugh. It's a shame really.

I really hate the fact how so many people make rude comments on the Escort. OK, so they're not fabulously looking, noisy and slow, and can be as bare boned as can be, but it is the only car that has proved it's reliability to me.

There's really not much to say about the Escorts. Known as the 2nd generation models, they were built from 1991 to 1996, with safety features and cosmetic alterations along the way. 1994 models came with a driver's side airbag and optional passenger. More powerful A/C units were found in the 1995 and newer models. An LX-E was available in sedan form in 1992 but was dropped in 1994.

Other than the reliability the Escort has given me until I totalled it, there really isn't much else to say about this car. Other than the GT/LX-E models, the LX sedans and wagons came with a paltry 1.9L 4-banger which produced a significant 88HP at the crank. Once it reached the wheels, only about 70HP was found to be had. You're not going to win any races with this 22 second car, heck, you'll have enough of a hard time driving home on a hill with groceries in the back. It was a shame the engine power output was never increased during this generations run, because it needed it. The 1.8L DOHC engine solved that but was available only on the GT coupe and the extra rare LX-E sedan. Beyond power numbers, the engine was noisy, and the automatic transmission shifted really hard, especially when you accelerate. The engine also takes a while to warm up, on any given day.

Ride and comfort was decent. It wasn't the most comfortable on long trips but was more than adequate for an economy car. Cabin room I found was actually quite good for such a small car; seating 4 full sized adults wouldn't be too much of a problem.

Fit and finish was good, and the choices of plastic and vinyl throughout the interior was well thought out. The cloth buckets provided decent lumbar support but I wasn't a fan of the automatic seatbelts. I would've also liked to see the center console moved up higher.

The body and chassis is built strong. I've run curbs at driving speeds have have been hit in the front and rear end, yet no structural damage. Although it is technically a safety hazard because the Escort doesn't absorb shock well, you know you won't be facing with a crushed or dented bumper any time soon. Unfortunately, rust can be a problem with the Escort though so try to avoid it if you can by washing regularly and keeping the body free from debris and chips.

My sedan was the base model, and the only perks that came with it was power mirrors and a rear defroster.

Beyond that, I've found the Escort to serve me very well when I had it. Actually, I am planning to buy another Escort (A wagon this time) as a daily driver since my Maxima isn't exactly cheap to drive everyday.

It's unfortunate that the Escort is a little lacking in terms of fit and finish and quality, as well as the lack of power, but in terms of reliability, my Escort didn't let me down, and it would easily rank near the top with the Civics and Corollas when you regard reliability as you most important characteristic.
