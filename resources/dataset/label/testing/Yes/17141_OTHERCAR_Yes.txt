            I purchased this camera for my wife to replace her Kodak DC-215.  I wanted a camera based on the CF Card platform, and selected the A40 based on other Epinions reviews.  

When you pull this camera out of the box, the first thing that you will notice is the way that it fits your hands.  I am very pleased.  Your hands tend to find a natural position, and rarely do you end up with a finger of the flash, or covering the lense.

After turning the camera on, you will realize that this camera has a ton of features.  Initially, this was great.  I thought that we'd use all of them.  After about 6 months of use, guess what... we don't use any of them except for the full auto mode.  

For the more advanced user, the camera offers a fully manual mode which allows the user to configure nearly every aspect of the photo.  I have not tried this feature as I have no desire to do anything other than point and shoot.

The one feature that I actually could use is the panoramic mode.  This mode keeps approximately 1/3 of the previous picture on either the left or right of the screen, so that you can align your next photo.  Using the included Photostitch software you can then "sew" the photos into some pretty neat photos.

Photo quality:  I feel that the indoor photos have a "cool" feel to them.  By that I mean that they appear to be a blueish gray color.  By switching to manual mode, you are allowed to adjust the white balance based on the type of light (natural, incandecent, etc).  This does help with the overall quality, but is hardly worth the work to bother.  Other than that issue, images are crisp and well focused.  I would rank the picture quality as above average to excellent.

We have experienced issues with indoor low light focusing, even with the focus assist "light" activated.  It is not a major problem, just that it requires multiple tries to compose the picture and actually get the camera to lock the focus.

Battery life: We utilize the standard viewfinder to compose all shots and then have the display pop up for a 2 second preview of the image.  This greatly increases the battery life.  We then pop the CF card out of the camera and read them using a USB card reader.  By utilizing both of these tactics, battery life is not an issue.

Overall, I recommend the camera, but I still feel as if the Kodak more accurately represents colors, especially skin tones.
