            I bought this car four years ago with relatively low mileage.  It was around 70K and at seven years old and having had two previous owners she was in very good condition.  I drive across state about once a month and went cross-country last summer without any major trauma.  

Pro's:
The V6 engine gives this baby POWER.  Roars like thunder when I accelerate and doesn't choke at all.  

So roomy! I went on tour with this car and we were able to fit all our guitars, a small amp, and my drumkit PLUS the 3 of us! It was tight but much easier than renting a van.  

Gas mileage: about 26 mpg on freeways... nice!


Con's:
Due to some weird quirk with the wiring the fuses burn out frequently, this means replacing a headlight and/or tail light once every three months, and those buggers are at least $10 a piece.  Ouch.  I talked to other Taurus owners and they all expressed the same oddity.  

Something is off with the balancing.  I get flat tires more than what I deem &quot;normal&quot;.  This has put me in some scary situations but I think it is amazing my ENGINE has never been problem.  This delights me.  

At time of purchase my brakes were at 30%, the dealer told me that was fine but 30% doesn't instill enough confidence in me so I had those replaced right off the bat.   


I recommend this car to college students and small families who like to have a car with some power.  <br><br>
