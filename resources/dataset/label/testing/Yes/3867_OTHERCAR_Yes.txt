            We bought our 1999 GMC Yukon last year just before Christmas.  My husband doesn't like to keep a vehicle longer than 3 years.  We had owned our current van for only 2 years, but it was such a rattle trap that he decided to get rid of it early!  It would shake, rattle and roll down the highway.  We took one test drive in our Yukon and were sold.  It is such a sturdy vehicle and has a smooth ride.  We have had it for just over a year and it has not developed any of those irritating noises or rattles.  
At the time, we really were thinking about the Suburban, however we just couldn't afford it.  The Yukon is expensive, but not nearly as bad as the Suburban.  The Yukon doesn't seat as many people as the Suburban, but it has lots of room in the back for storage.  I also like the cover that you can pull over your cargo, so that passersby can't see what you have back there.<br><br>
