            My Mercury Capri is a 1994, &quot;reef green&quot; (according to Mercury), soft-top convertible. What's great about my Mercury Capri? You don't see many of them on the road, especially not in the &quot;reef green&quot;, which really translates to teal, color.

I love my little car. I zip around with the top down in the summer, small enough to sneak between big trucks and SUVs in bumper-to-bumper traffic. It accelerates fast, stops well, and makes you just feel like you're having fun. Wheeeeeee!!! Just one problem: girls who can't handle extra trucker attention need not apply.

But then the winter comes. My wonderful car becomes slow, slipping on the ice and blown around by winter winds. You can't scrape the back window (it's plastic). And the wind noise, my god, the wind noise! Sometimes the inside fogs up if you have the heater going because of the outside-to-inside temperature difference. But boy does this car heat up fast. I never wear my coat in the car. I get too hot too fast.

My little car has held up very well over the years. I have some problems with the top, but that is due to the fact that I had to replace it after a break-in, which involved an unfortunate knife-slitting. Repairs have been very minimal, and are not usually expensive. Plus, the car has a backseat, if only for insurance purposes.

I would recommend this car for the gal I used to be: college student with time to cruise and listen to tunes. Now that I have worked my way into the career world, I probably won't keep my little car much longer. However, I am definitely going to get another convertible. I can't live without the thrill. This time I think I'll get one I can find in the parking lot though.<br><br>
