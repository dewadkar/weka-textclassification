            I agree full-heartedly with wolfman07 and wish I could have contacted him -- 

I was in love with my Audi, even after my first one was rear-ended, totalled and replaced by an identical, but more loaded one which was, again, rear-ended (less tragically, however).  The car is definitely a luxury ride with lots of standard and added comforts.  I love the built-in sunshades and the solar-powered air circulation that comes with the warm-weather package.  I rely completely on the rear-parking signal and desperately wish there was one on the front end!:

I was surprised (and somewhat relieved of feeling too stupid) to read of wolfman07's experience the day after the EXACT same thing happened to me-- I very easily RIPPED the front of the car off:  

I had parked in a parking lot close to the curb so that the car next to me would have plenty of room.  When I pulled out, I pulled back and forward just twice to angle out and heard a scraping noise.  I thought it was my hubcaps, as I often park too close to the curb to get out of traffic.  To my astonishment -- I didn't notice until later in the day -- the entire front "bumper" of plastic had pulled off, along with the lower front grills, the headlight washers and almost one headlight. -- $1500 worth of damage, luckily some of it covered by insurance.  

When I mentioned it to the dealership service, I was told they hadn't heard of that "defect" (of the lip at the front of the car that would catch at the bottom upon reversing) and I would have to make an appointment with the "service manager" who would then contact me when the Audi mfr. rep "periodically" visited and that they would only cover it if they felt "good will" was called for.  The service manager never called me back, and quite frankly, I haven't been up feeling up to playing games...
 
The dealership sold us the child bench-seat to go with our first Audi wagon in Dec. 1999.  That wagon was totalled within 1 month and, within 2 months, we very loyally purchased an identical Audi wagon -- the bench-seat still on order.  Despite periodic, repeated phone calls to our slick salesman, we were told that one seat was in but was broken and had to be sent back.  By Dec.2000, we still hadn't received it.  By Feb.2000, we were going to start writing letters (now that our kids were big enough to use the seat), so the salesman said he had one in and he'd help me install it.  He did install it, and when I got home, I realized it was the broken one -- cracked on the side, so that the seat did not stay upright!  After more severe phone calls, he said another one was on the way, but never called when it came in.  Thereafter, I dealt directly with the parts department which was, at least, honest (although they never called either -- I had to make weekly calls to see if the seat had arrived).  Three seats later (one was the wrong color, another one was broken) we are very happy with the ability to carry almost 7 passengers in a reasonably-sized car. 

Cupholders-- one in front is very precariously at the top of the dashboard and the two in back are even more precariously at the edge of the seat by your legs (where kids can stand on them).  They are very fragile balancing acts that do not hold liquid well and, based on a spring system (so that they open by mistake when you push on them), they malfunctioned within the first month or two.  Best bet, especially with children is that they get stuck shut (as opposed to open) and forget about them.
