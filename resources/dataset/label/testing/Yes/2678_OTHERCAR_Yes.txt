            So many reviews are written by folks that do not actually own the vehicle. For all the stats, go to the Freelander web site. What I like about our Freelander SE is that it strikes a fantastic balance. 

The leather seats, CD Stereo, Sunroof and overall build quality really impress. Stereo and cruise controls are on the steering wheel. Tinted glass and an electric FRONT and rear windshield defroster are standard.

This is a technologically advanced vehicle. A BMW automatic transmission permits the user to shift as well. Decent control, traction control, ABS brakes, and a unique suspension provide a wonderful on road experience. Off road manners are provided by chassis engineering, the SE comes equipped with 17" tires and 50 series Michelin tires. The Freelander is the best riding SUV on road I have ever driven, the steering is several orders of magnitude better than anything else. 

Other great features include a rear window that rolls down, external mount for the spare tire, providing more space in the trunk and rear retracting trunk cover and holddowns. Get the optional rubber floor mats, they are fitted and do a great job. Split rear sears fold down and away in a snap. The rear opens like a door, sideways; which has worked out to be a big plus for my wife, the trunk door also opens by itself after the half way mark.

Dealer service is a big plus. 4/48000 is the standard warranty, extended warranties are also available. We are provided a loaner car for all services, a dedicated service representative and the salesman actually makes follow up calls after every visit. The dealer experience is just fantastic. They also offer outings and all sorts of Land Rover accessories.
