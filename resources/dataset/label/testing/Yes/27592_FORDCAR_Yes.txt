            For the last several months I have been wondering whether or not I might want to buy a new car.  I have taken many test drives with somewhat mixed results and have found no vehicle that is totally to my liking.  All this may have just changed as I test drove a Ford Escape on Friday.  I still am not sure if I want to purchase a new car(it is quite an investment); however, if I do, I am almost certain that I will go with this great new vehicle from Ford.

The Escape comes in either XLT or XLS models.  The engine of the car can come in either a 4 or a 6 cylinder and I was happy to drive the latter.  I found that the pickup was very good and 0-60 was possible in a small amount of time.  To me this is an important feature because I live in a big city and am often required to make quick moves while entering the highway.  The 4 cylinder variety may not provide the needed acceleration for me.  I found out that this car weighs about 3500 pounds; however it does not pull the torque to do any serious off-roading.  This car is advertised as an SUV; however, it may fail a bit in this area.  I am not interested in any off-road driving anyway, so this doesn't bother me in the slightest.

In this vehicle Ford has used the contour Trak 2 which allows the user to either leave the car in automatic or switch to 4 wheel drive.  This is a nice feature and may be very useful in icy or hazardous conditions.  Even while in automatic, the car may switch to 4 wheel drive if the rear tires are felt slipping by the car's computer.  This is a great feature to have if the conditions become treacherous.  

This SUV is also very nice for family use.  In the model I drove I found that the back seats had ample space and, the driver sits like a king on a throne, with a great deal of headroom and comfort.  Furthermore, the car averages 23 miles to the gallon which is quite good for a large vehicle.  This will definitely save the owner a bunch in the long run in comparison to similar models.  The minimum package for the car includes ABS, side air bags and automatic transmission as well as a nice stereo system.(CD optional of course)

The car handles very well around even the sharpest of corners and the ride is smooth.  Also, the engine purrs like a kitten.  I was impressed by all of these, as I have noticed a great deal of handling problems in the past from similar models.  Furthermore, this SUV is priced at around 20,000 dollars which makes it very affordable to most consumers.  All in all, this is a great  vehicle at a great price.  Unless you have your heart set on some serious-off road fun then I would recommend this vehicle to you.<br><br>
