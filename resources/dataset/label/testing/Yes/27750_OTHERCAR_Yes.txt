            I would first like to say that I'm not huge a photography enthusiast before this but this tiny little marvel changed me. I used to be one who would have a roll of film in my camera for months at a time with nothing to snap and I hate having to lug around even the most compact 35mm cameras. So, when I decided to start looking for a digital camera just to get candid &amp; vacation shots, I did a lot of review reading including those of professionals and users as well. I wanted a 3+ megapixel (that's what everyone told me I needed) but after reading a lot of articles and considering my budget, I settled for a 2 megapixel. I thought that I found the perfect camera when I read about the Kodak DC3400 (and the DC280) but it had the same problems with the usual 35mm camera... way too big to carry around (without looking like a tourist all the time). 

So, I go to the local electronics store and this shiny little box the size of a pack of playing cards was on the shelf as well. I picked it up and fell in love with it's size. After weighing the pro and cons and reading a lot of reviews, looking at samples, I knew that I had to have it. 

What do I think of it after using it for a while? I love it. Granted it does have it's drawbacks but I suppose it's part of the compromise of a camera that you can finally take anywhere you wanted. 

Generally, the S100 is a point and shoot camera. The picture quality is good for that purpose but definitely not the best. I think that the Kodak still has better picture quality. Focus is a bit on the soft side but it handles colors very naturally. It's 2x optical focus is a bit short but it's usable. I don't use the 4x digital zoom because I hate the pixelization that any digital zoom adds. The flash is acceptable but I wish it was softer. The LCD is really nice. It's quite small (what did you expect?) but very good contrast even in bright sunlight conditions. The LCD refresh rate is very good too.

I love the fact that it uses a Lithium Ion rechargeable battery. which is included in the package with a charger as well. It charges in 2 hours (less than that, in actual fact) from being totally dry. It last about 130 or more shots using the LCD but sparingly. I got myself a 48MB CF card to complement it and it gets you 81 shots at the Fine/Large resolution. I don't feel that the SuperFine/Large setting is much better than the Fine/Large. I did a side by side, blown up comparison and the JPEG compression is quite indistinguishable between the two settings. Superfine/Large only gets you 32 shots on a 48MB flash. I've heard a few reviewers say the the menus are hard to understand but I found them quite intuitive even for a digital camera first timer. A bit of common sense helps.  

The camera feels very sturdy but I have yet to drop it or anything. I take care of it like a new born baby. It didn't come with a case, though. I was quite disappointed because for the price, I think that Canon could have thrown it into the package. I have been carrying it in my jeans pocket and it feels quite comfortable eventhough there isn't much pocket space on a pair of jeans. I bought myself the soft case from Canon to compliment the camera.

The USB interface makes transferring files to your computer really fast. I use a PCMCIA compact flash adapter (I use a laptop) since it doesn't use up my battery. It also has a TV output which I have yet to use. 

So, what didn't I like about this camera? well, it's a bit slow. There's a delay from the time you press the shutter button to the time the picture is taken. You then to miss some shot because of this. This is not a camera for taking action shots. That's my main complaint. Besides that I would have to complain that it's a bit pricey but I know how much miniaturization costs being in the technology industry myself.

In conclusion, if you want a digital camera you will actually take anywhere you go that gives you good quality pictures, this little guys is for you. It really packs a punch for it's size. Great for vacation or just any kind of shots you would want to take at an instant. Anyone can use it. But if you are a total photography enthusiast that demands the highest quality images, this is not the camera for you.
