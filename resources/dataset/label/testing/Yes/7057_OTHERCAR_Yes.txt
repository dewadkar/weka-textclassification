            First, let me say that I spent 10-12 hours researching digital cameras before selecting the Fuji.  I was struggling between the Fuji 4700 and the Canon S20.  For me the clincher was that the Fuji used standard AA batteries and came with NiMH plus it had a movie mode.  This camera was to replace an older Sanyo unit we had so we are not new to digital photography.

First impression: Wow this thing is small!  And only 2 AAs, really?

Now that we have taken several hundred pictures with it, we LOVE it!  The continuous shooting mode is AWESOME for action shots which we use.  It will take 3 high-res pictures in rapid succession (about 3 in 1 second) which is perfect for sporting shots.  My wife rides horses and I play volleyball and timing the shot (especially with a digital camera) is very hard.  I must say this feature and the super-fast focus and reaction time is very much appreciated.  You can power on the camera, compose, and take a shot in less than 2 seconds (without flash).

The picture quality is outstanding.  Alot of reviewers have bad-mouthed this camera since Fuji was stupid and tried to market it as a 4 Megapixel camera which it is not.  I will spare you the involved discussion about interpolation, but I can say the quality is very good.  Plus the default color balance is perfect and very warm, much like Kodak film.  This is something that the Canon S20 reportedly has problems with.  The 3x optical zoom is wonderful and was a feature I really missed on our older Sanyo digital camera.

Mine came with 2 sets of 2 AA NiMh 1600mAH batteries and I can take about
100 pictures with the viewscreen, occassional flash and playback, etc. on a single charge.  Since they were kind enough to supply the extra set and charger, I have not had to purchase anymore.  Plus, the pair of AAs is nice to know if I ever get caught in a pinch I can buy a pair anywhere.

The USB is extremely fast and I prefer the smaller SmartMedia cards that this uses.  Plus, I can grab my card out of our MP3 player if I am ever in a pinch for more 'film'.  

The movie mode is also quite good and it even records audio.  It creates easy AVI movies for you without any special software.  Perfect for a home inventory or a quick sequence of those special family moments you want to capture. 

While the flash is a little weak (not suprising considering how small it is), it does ok out to about 10 feet.  The good news though is that this camera defaults to ISO 200.  What this means is that it should do well in low-light situations without the flash.  I was a little skeptical, but I took several test shots in a poorly-lit museum and the picture quality was great!  In fact, I find myself rarely ever using the flash it does so well.

This camera has almost no downsides that I could see.  My biggest beef is that they dont offer a 'true' resolution storage mode.  You can choose 640x480, 1280x960, or 2400x1800.  Since the camera is not really a 4 megapixel it would be nice if they would offer an in-between resolution to save storage space and save reduction time on the computer.  A resolution around 1600x1200 would have been appreciated.  You also cant use the optical zoom during the movie mode which seems a big oversight. 

Most of all though, I love how easy this camera is to operate.  We have never looked at the manual and have explored almost every feature the camera has (see http://www.dpreview.com/ for an in-depth review) and it has almost everything that an experienced, but not professional, photographer would want.  The modes are intuitive and I find myself able to take excellent pictures very quickly with little preparation.  The intuitive screen system is the best I have ever seen and you can do almost everything without the viewscreen to save battery power, if you wish.  The playback mode is the best I have ever seen and the ability to pan and zoom in on pictures during playback is great for checking your focus and impressing your family and friends!

In conclusion, if you want a great, portable family camera that can capture an active lifestyle, the Fuji 4700 would be an excellent choice.

UPDATE ON 7/8:

I still love this camera.  It has given us the freedom to 'waste' pictures like we never have before.  The zoom-in feature on the screen is great to wow your friends and trim it to the 'keepers' quickly after the fact.  The battery life has been quite fine for my needs and I rarely even bother taking a spare set anymore.  The movie mode was great for taking a home inventory and I expect to use it for our upcoming ultrasound and baby shots.  Ease-of-use has really translated into frequency of use for us!<br><br>
