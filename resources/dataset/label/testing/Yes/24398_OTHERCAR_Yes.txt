            We bought this vehicle when I had a hunch that we might start a family.  It has been a fantastic little car!  The price was great ($8,500) and it came with some wonderful features (i.e. air conditioning, power windows/locks, automatic).  It also handles beautifully in the snow.

I was very hesitant about buying a Ford product, but this car has astounded me.  We are currently at 69K and we only had to replace the front brakes and a smog sensor (which Ford gracefully paid for that), and the collision avoidance light and dome light went out.

One gripe is that we have a chronic alignment problem that nobody can seem to fix.  Talking to the guy at the tire shop, he says that it is a problem that he sees a lot in Fords.  My only other gripe is that though there is a nice amount of trunk space, there isn't enough interior space for a 4-door sedan.  Long trips are often uncomfortable.  Also, with two car seats in the back seat, there is no room for anyone else.

I recommend this car to families of three or less or as a commuter car.  It's easy handling makes it simple to whip in and out of traffic.  It's strong engine and excellent gas mileage (approx. 20 in town and 30-35 highway) make it extremely economical.<br><br>
