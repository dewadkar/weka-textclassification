            This is a Lexus for around $40,000. You pay almost that for an Explorer these days and there is no comparison. From looks to ride this is a top of the line performer. Gas miliage is great to. Around 22 mile per gallon in the city. The power will absolutely stun you for onlt a six cylindar. must but for anyone who is in the market for a SUV. You are getting lexus quality for fords price. you can't go wrong. I have a pearl white one and it still turns my head when my wife drives it. I don't plan on getting rid of this one soon. Was so pleased with this one, I bought myself a GS300.
