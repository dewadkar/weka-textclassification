            After purchasing a T&amp;C Lx, our family was requested to attend a wedding in  Arizona. A road trip was the easy choice, to drive the new van or rent a car for the 2,300 mile round trip took some thought. After deciding the mileage wouldn't make a huge difference, we chose to take the T&amp;C. I'm glad we did, and here's why.

Cargo space - plenty of room for a large ice chest, full size suitcase, two duffel bags for the kids, pillows, bags of snacks... you name it. Everything for a week on the road would never have fit into even the largest of car trunks, and probably a tight squeeze in the Toyota Siena we also considered buying.

Performance - the highways had an 75 mph speed limit, which I had no trouble exceeding in many cases, even on steep grades. On those two-lane pains, passing a slowpoke doing 65 was a breeze. Handling felt like a vehicle in the sport class, lane shifts were sure and stable.

Comfort - I drove up to 8 hours straight without any kind of driver discomfort. When I drove my new '94 Honda Civic 30 minutes home, my butt fell asleep (I've since learned exactly how to sit in that seat to keep it from happening). On the way back, we stopped in Laughlin, Nevada for lunch. The temperature was 104, but re-entry to the van, which had been sitting in full sun for over an hour was unbeleivable. The champaign color and tinted windows kept the leather seats cool enough to sit on with bare legs.

Our '90 Chrysler LeBaron has 170,000 miles on it, we've had minimal problems with it. The T&amp;C seems even more solid initially, and I'm looking forward to another long lasting reliable car. <br><br>
