            In my opinion, the 2000 Nissan Maxima is by far the best value in this class of cars.  I would even go as far to say that it is comparable to some cars costing $10,000 or more.  First of all, the car is beautiful both inside and out, especially when you add the SE package, which includes nice 5-spoke wheels, a rear spoiler, and CD player.  Second, the car produces some great power, I only wish I had selected the manual transmission over the automatic.  I recently drove a 2000 SE with manual transmission and found the car to be substantially quicker and much more fun to drive.  Third, the fit and finish on this car blows away any American car in this class and is on par with the Accord, Camry, and some other more expensive cars as well.

The few complaints I have of the car is that the length of time that the automatic transmission takes to shift from 1st to 2nd gear in too long.  This is fine when you want to air it out on an open road, but becomes annoying what cruising around town.  Also, the windshield wipers are very loud.  Besides that, this car is an absolute dream...affordable, good looking, and fun to drive.   <br><br>
