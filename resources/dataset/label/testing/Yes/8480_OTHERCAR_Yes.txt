            This is the second digital camera I have owned (the first a Fuji 1400z is reviewed here <a href='/content_37311516292'>http://www.epinions.com/content_37311516292</a>).  I was so happy with my first Fuji camera I decided to try another for my step up from 1 megapixel to two.

This camera has two main options, still photos and short (20 second) movies.  The still pictures have great color and you can adjust the quality depending on what you want to use the photo for (email, printing, web etc.).  The 2 megapixel on Fine Quality is good enough that I printed it at 8x10 on a Hp Photosmart printer and the result looked like film.  The 1 megapixel is perfect for sending through email or posting to a web page.

The movie option is fun to play with, but not very useful.  The movies have no sound and are very low resolution.  Like I said, its fun to play around and show to your family, but these movies would never be saved for your posterity.  I bought this camera for the still pictures, which is why I did not lower the score for the bad quality movies.  If this feature were important to you, I would recommend a camera that has a little higher resolution and some sound.

The batteries lasted about 125 pictures, but I rarely use the LCD on the back. This would probably cut the amount of pictures I got from the batteries if I did use it. The camera comes with a 16 mb card, but I would recommend a 64 mb card if you want to take a lot of pictures.  64 mb cards hold approximately 70 pictures at the highest quality.  One negative concerning the card, you have to remove it through the battery compartment.  You do not need to take the card out too often so this isn't a big deal.

The camera is small enough that it fits in the pocket of a dress shirt, or easily into a purse.

There are small manual adjustments you can make like white balance and macro mode, but this camera is mostly for those point and shoot photographers.
