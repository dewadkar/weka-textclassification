            So you decided to buy a Kia. Sold on the Sephia or the Rio? Stop! You may find the Spectra to better fit your needs for the same price. <i>Rumor has it that this is the last year for the Sephia and the Spectra is its replacement</i>

Without a doubt, the Spectra is the sportiest Kia for the price. The hatchback design and looks make the Spectra a heavy hitter in its class. 


<b>Price</b>

MSRP
$11,245-$16,800


<b>Handling</b>

Nice beefy leather wrapped steering wheel helps you barrel into corners. Tires do not grip very when turning fast. 
Essentially the same suspension as the Sephia (Macpherson)....fairly tight and good on bumpy roads.   

<b>Performance</b>

The 16-valve fuel injected engine is the same one that powers her older sister Sephia (1.8 liter). Producing 125 horsepower at 6,000 rpm it gets up and moves quite well. Although the 5 speed pulls better than the automatic from a dead stop, the shifter has a bit too much play in it for me (Torque - 108lb per foot at 4500 rpm). 


<b>Interior</b>

The interior is more spacious than the Sephia with its unique hatchback design. With the rear 60/40 split, you can really cram this car full of stuff (coolers, fishing poles, kegs...). The rear seats have more room than most of the other cars in its class. Seats 5 large adults without a problem. Standard CD player & 6 speaker sound system (GSX) sounds very crisp. 


<b>Exterior</b>

By far...the most fancy Kia in the bunch (Optima is in another class). The front end is more stylish than the Sephia and the Rio. The tail end speaks for itself. From a short distance it could be mistaken for a 4 door Accord. From the side...it has some characteristics of an Audi. The 14 inch alloy wheels add a nice touch to this little sports car.


<b>Safety</b> 

The Spectra has a collapsible steering column, reinforced crumple zones (for impact), steel side-door impact beams, dual airbags, energy-absorbing bumpers and child-safety locks. 
 

<b>Fuel Economy</b>

Tank capacity 13.2 gallons 
Unleaded Fuel (87 octane or higher) 
Manual transmission (5-speed) 23 city & 29 highway
Automatic transmission (4-speed w/overdrive)  22 city & 32 highway 


<b>Warranty</b>

-Limited Powertrain 10 years or 100,000 miles 
-Limited Basic 5 years or 60,000 miles 
-Limited Anti-Perforation 5 years or 100,000 miles 
-Roadside Assistance 5 years/unlimited miles 

<i>A little extra $$ will bump the basic 5 year basic 60,000 to match the 10 year 100,000 warranty</i>

<b>Overall Rating</b>

Scale 1-10 (10 best)

I give the Spectra a 7. The best Kia out of the bunch. I'd buy this car over a Civic, Sentra, Focus, Mirage, Echo, and Saturn. Without thinking twice...you can't beat the features and price.
