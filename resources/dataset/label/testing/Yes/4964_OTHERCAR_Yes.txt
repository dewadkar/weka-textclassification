            OK, that may be overstating it a little, but still, I have fallen victim to buying name brand recognition over value.  My one and only personal car is a 1999 Toyota Camry XLE,  weekly test cars have circulated so frequently that our family has need to own only one car, so you�d think it would have been a VERY carefully considered choice.  Like many other consumers, I did not consider other brands that, in recent months, I have found to be excellent alternatives to the overpriced and under-equipped Camry.  Had the XG300 been for sale at the time I bought my Camry, I would have considered adding it to my shopping list (along with the Buick Regal GS, Buick Park Ave., VW GTI and the Mazda Millenia S).

Add a new brand to the list of other makes to consider against Camry and Accord.  Hyundai.  Yes, Hyundai.  The XG300 is a really great car, it does have drawbacks, but overall it is a very worthy alternative to the more common mid-priced sedans.

First, styling is rather bland, but somewhat executive looking.  The XG300 looks much better and bigger in pictures than it does in real life.  Styling is similar to the early Toyota Cressida (from behind) and/or a scaled down version of the first Infiniti Q45 (from the side).  Frankly, the  Sonata is the better looking Hyundai.  Considering exterior styling alone, the XG300 comes off looking like a mid-1980s, Japan market, luxury car.

Inside the XG300 you�ll find all the normal luxury trappings; wood accent dashboard, leather, brushed aluminum surfaces, and a lack of cheap shiny hard plastic.  Normally the smell of leather adds a touch of elegance, but in many Hyundai cars the smell is rather cheap, and hints of a petroleum scent. Seats are fairly comfortable, but not up to luxury car standards.  Switches and controls fall easily to hand, but seem slightly dated.  For example, the push-button ventilation controls feel as if they came from a �91 Nissan Stanza.  Overall, the buttons and switches retain a quality feel and have the look of a near luxury Japanese car.  The one feature that seems as if it was not built to last, is the tilt steering wheel lever.  The built in trip computer is one of the small things Camry and Accord don�t provide at a slightly higher price.  The stock CD/cassette  stereo sounds very good, and has several preset equalizer setting similar to what comes with most General Motors car stereos.

Rear seating room is adequate, and four 6 foot adults can ride comfortably for quite a distance.  Rear passengers have an armrest, cup holders, and a small storage bin, much like some Buick and Oldsmobile cars. The XG300 has a very large trunk, bigger perhaps than both Accord and Camry.  60/40 spilt fold down rear seat is easy to use, but the overall opening to the trunk area is somewhat constricted.  Overall interior room is comparable to a Camry, but maybe a little less than an  Accord or Taurus.

Behind the wheel the XG300 feels like the near luxury car it is meant to be.  Road noise in minimal � it�s surprisingly quiet.  On rough roads the larger Hyundai maintains its composure, and little noise or vibration find its way  to the driver.  All this smoothness, and one would expect soft wallowing suspension � but no !  The XG300 retains a somewhat sporty flair during mild and hard cornering, and there is little of the dreaded �floaty� feeling on the open highway.  The 3.0 liter V-6 produces 192 hp, and is very responsive.  Although the Hyundai V-6 is only a twin-cam (many others are four-cam, including Toyota) it still manages to stay smooth and quiet even under hard acceleration. The XG300�s V-6 is different from the Sonata V-6.  The 2.4L V-6 in the Sonata gives only 170 hp, and yet the XG300 makes due  with only a little more power than its smaller brother.  200+ horsepower would be more in keeping with the XG300�s intended market.

Overall the Hyundai XG300 scores high in almost every area; interior comfort, engine, ride/handling, storage space, and amenities.   The main point with this car is value.  You get many luxury features, in a near luxury car, all for about $23,000.  The icing on the cake here is Hyundai�s exceptional warranty.  A 10 year/100,000 mile power train warranty,  5 year bumper to bumper to bumper warranty, and free roadside assistance are hard to beat at any price.  Hyundai has turned the corner, leaving behind the dreaded Excel.  Will a Hyundai last?  Only time will tell, but if Hyundai has left its reliability problems as far behind as it has left the lowly Excel, there will be no stopping them.
