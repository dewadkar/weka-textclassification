            Pros: The twin turbos on the R/T model provide enormous power and acceleration. The awd and all wheel steer make the car extraordinarily smooth and stable around tight curves. The front bucket seats are quite comfortable and the leather is plush. The climate control and sound systems both factory are more than adaquate.

Cons: One of the biggest cons of this car is its backseat. Although it is typical of a sports car one can't help but be dissapointed by the cramped space in back. My only other complaint is the positioning of the shifter. It is not the most comfortable nor natural placement, but it is not noticeable given a little time

The styling and power make this car anything but stealthy. The purr of the engine and the slick curves of its body make it stand out in a crowd. Not to mention that I have taken numerous corvettes and porsche on the open road!!

Anyone that loves power, speed, and handling should buy this car. <br><br>
