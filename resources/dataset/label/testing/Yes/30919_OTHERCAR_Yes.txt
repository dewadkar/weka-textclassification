            I first saw the Chrysler Sebring at an auto dealer as I was looking around for a new car with a sporty look but still with enough room to fit me comfortably as I stand nearly 6'2&quot;.

I found the Sebring to have a lot more interior space than other cars in it's class, the other vehicles I looked at lacked legroom and/or backseat, I nearly had to fold myself in half in order to get behind the wheels of a Ford Mustang.
Taking the car for a test drive was lots of fun. I liked it's fast lines and sporty looks although I did miss the power of a V8. The car handles well on roads and interstates taken into consideration that it was not designed as a high performance vehicle. I did however get attached and bought the car the same day as I have no children and don't require a four door vehicle... I would not recommend this car to individuals or couples with children or pets.

Owning the Sebring har brought no problems. As I bought the car used I immediately gave it a complete tune-up and have had no problems since. I can say, however, that great gas mileage was something that Chrysler did not take into the equation when designing the vehicle, my average so far has been around 24 miles per gallon... and that's with a four cylinder!
I do give Chrysler credit for the design of the body but the interior could stand some improvements. The speakers were cheap stuff even for factory quality and had to be replaced.
To own a Sebring has it's ups and downs although the ups by far outnumber the downs.<br><br>
