            Wow!  This car is a whopper of a goodie.  I can't explain to you what this car has done for me.  I live in Boston so the winters can get pretty ruff, but the weather is no match for this car.  When I was in the army, I drove a jeep with chained tires and the traction I got was great.  I feel the same traction as I do with the discovery without the chains as I did with the jeep.  It is a roomy and luxurious car.  Comes in all sorts of fantastic colors and optinal leather interior.  As they said in the army, Be all you can be, this car is just that.<br><br>
