            I have been the sole owner/driver of my Titanium Metallic Honda Civic EX, purchased in May of 2000.  It is a solid car which I would be comfortable recommending to a friend.  I have not had any complications with the car, rather, I have experienced "issues."  

My vehicle history:  First, and foremost, I think it is important that I provide a briefing on the maintenance of my Honda.  My Honda is my baby receiving the care prescribed by the owner's manual with all parts and labor provided by a local Honda Dealership -- and I have received excellent service.  My current mileage exceeds 40,000 and my engine is still purring like a kitten.

Fore-mentioned "Issues": 
1/ Odor: About 2 months after I purchased the vehicle I began to notice a terrible pungent odor when I turned on the Air Conditioning.  I took it to the dealership immediately, as it was suggested by a friend that the odor may be related to the catalytic converter.  The dealership responded that the catalytic converter was in good condition; however they did notice a hard plastic patch where it appeared that a plastic bag might have located itself there from underneath my car and melted.  They stated that they scraped the substance off and deodorized my ventilation system.  The odor stayed away for a couple of months, but it did return -- now I just try to pretend its not there.  I will probably take it in to have it deodorized again soon, now that the weather is warming up. 
2/ Piston Slap:  Although my car purrs like a kitten out on the roadway, one can notice a bit of a hostile piston slap just upon start-up; not really the sound of a brand-new engine.  Once the car warms up it is really pretty quiet.

After-sale Service:  Excellent!!  Parts and labor are very reasonably priced and I get a free vacuuming and a car wash whenever I take it in.  I couldn't be more pleased.

Seat Comfort: First I must say that I am a person who needs to be sitting with good posture in order to be comfortable.  The Honda driver's seat is arched so that one assumes more of a fetal-type position when driving.  Although this may be comfortable for some; I find that I need to shove a pillow at the base of my spine at the one-hour mark to provide lower-back support (I wish there was back-support adjustment of some kind).

Good year-round vehicle:  I have never encountered problems with my Honda while driving in the rain or snow -- it handles beautifully.  

Highly versatile: Great for camping and great for dining out.  While this is quite a sweet-looking car with its titanium-metallic paint and moon-roof; the car is great for going off onto gravel roads and camping.  All stones stay underneath of the car, interior is upholstry and cleans easily, and rear seats fold down so that you can load up with fishing roads and sleep in the trunk in the evening if need-be (yes, it is comfortable).

Overall:  I do love my car and I am very happy with its performance -- and I would expect to be happy as it is a Honda.  (The odor issue does cause a bit of doubt, but I have not noticed this commented upon in other reviews)
