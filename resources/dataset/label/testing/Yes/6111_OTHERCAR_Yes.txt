            If you haven't gone to a Chevrolet Dealer to test drive the &quot;All-New Impala&quot;, you owe it to yourself to drive one.This car has the Luxury of a much more expensive vehicle. I recommend you drive the Sporty looking LS model that is fully loaded.I believe this vehicle would be at around $25,000 MSRP.This car takes you back to the cars of the 50's,60's, and 70's. I know, I had a 66 Chevy Impala that was Comfortable,Durable, and cost effective.The LS model gives you the look of a sporty car with Luxury car comfort at a mid-size price. Chevrolet has really out done themselves in the Re-introduction of the Chevrolet Impala. It has so many features versus the costs, that I believe the Impala gives you the most for the money. I am not real crazy about some of the Interior selections on the base model, but that is easy to overcome when you look at all the other features the car boasts.It seems to me that the Target audience for this car would be for Adults from Age 45 to 100.Test drive this car and you will see what I mean about the All-New 2000 Impala. Thanks for reading my opinion and Enjoy the ride!!!!!<br><br>
