            Although I've only owned my Mercury Mountaineer for 3 months, I have to say that I absolutely love it!  We looked at many SUV's including the oversized ones, and decided that the Mountaineer was the best deal for our money.  It is modeled after the Ford Explorer, but the Explorer comes with a lot less standard equipment.  By the time all of that is added on, the price is quite high.  

My husband snuck to the dealership for a test drive &amp; drove it to our home.  I walked out in the driveway &amp; almost flipped.  He brought one home with leather seats, power sunroof &amp; all the gadgets.  I told him there was no way we could afford to lease this vehicle!  I had to admit that I absolutely loved it though.  I told him to go back to the dealership &amp; find a cheaper one.  He went back and we learned since we were leasing, that it was actually cheaper to buy the one with all the gadgets.  To get those removed we would be paying over $20 more a month.  The dealership calculated the monthly payments &amp; we were shocked that it was only a few dollars more than what we were already paying.  We didn't realize an SUV could be so affordable!  

Another tip you may want to consider in leasing a vehicle (at least my experience with Ford/Mercury) is that you can get a lower rate, payment &amp; better residual value by leasing for 24 months.  If you want to keep it longer, Ford will extend your lease up to a year more at the same payment.  

So how does it ride you ask?  I love it.  The ride is surprisingly smooth &amp; it handles &amp; corners well.  Our SUV comes with All wheel drive, which some don't want (from what I've heard).  I live in the north and it snows here a lot!  Just yesterday we got 3 inches, and I drove without a slip or slide.  The roads were treacherous, but this SUV kept going.  One disadvantage of not getting AWD, is that you have to know that the road is slippery or may get that way.  Then you have to flip it into 4WD.  This is easy to do in weather like yesterday when it is obvious that the road is slippery.  Most days it isn't like that.  You can't flip to 4wd in the middle of a skid.  The AWD automatically does it for you, and makes your car run optimally.  

The interior of the Mountaineer is very roomy.  Compare it to a Blazer, and you'll see just how roomy it is!  There is a plenty of room in the back for 2 carseats for the kids, and an adult could fit comfortably between them.  The seats are extremely comfortable, and there is plenty of cargo space.  The gages (in the model we purchased) show everything from temperature to oil life.  It is no longer necessary to guess how much gas is in the tank.

If you're in the market for an SUV, take the time to look at the Mountaineer!<br><br>
