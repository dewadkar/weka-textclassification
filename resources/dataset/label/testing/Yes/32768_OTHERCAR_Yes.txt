            I have been looking around at the many new technological advances in things like cell phones, TV's, DVD players and cameras for some time now and have been very impressed.  It seems like every ten years or so things will be created that we couldn't even dream of just a decade in the past.  This Canon Powershot camera probably falls into that category with its many bells and whistles and its overall amazing technology. 

I am at times a fairly serious photographer and I recently got the chance to use this fine piece of equipment.  Although the camera sells for around 400 dollars which may be pricey to some, I must say that I have been amazed and impressed.  The first thing that stands out about this great camera are its 4 megapixels.  This is very generous and makes for very lifelike and engaging photography.  Next, the size of the camera is also a grand asset.  This is a very small piece of equipment and, although not the smallest digital camera I have ever seen, it still ranks among the smallest and is a great camera to take with you for a day of relaxing or whatever it is that you choose to do in your spare time.  Spur-of the moment shots will be easy and comfortably taken.  

The zoom feature of this camera is 3.0x for optical and 3.6 for digital.  This is also fairly generous in my mind for a point and shoot type of camera.  Again, with this feature I am impressed as to how far technology has come in regard to these advances.  Some extra features that I enjoyed were the Adjustable ISO settings that range from 50 to 400, the self-timer and the continuous shooting mode.  

This device also features several modes for the interested user.  They include automatic exposure mode, limited manual exposure mode, stitch mode and movie mode. The modes are easily selectable and even a novice would be able to always tell what mode he/she was in.  The movie mode is OK with around 3 minutes of video and decent resolution; however, I'd rather have my camcorder on me if I knew a video opportunity was to arise because of overall quality issues. 

The photo quality is very nice though as I must say that large printed shots look very lifelike and realistic.  They are not a huge improvement from some other digital models, but still they are much more than adequate.

There are really only two problems that I was able to find with regard to this camera.  The first is the battery life.  Cameras of this type have not traditionally been good at this issue, and the Powershot400 is no exception.  The camera uses the NB-1LH. Liion rechargeable that also powered the earlier S230 Powershot.  This battery seems to last around 50 minutes for me, which is adequate, but not great.  Backups can be purchased easily, but are fairly expensive at a cost of 49-69 dollars, so I'd recommend charging which takes about 2.5 hours.  Also, the battery life can be extended if the optical viewfinder is used.   

A second slight problem that I have found lies in the nighttime capabilities of this device.  Again, this is nothing out of the ordinary for this type of camera, but it is still somewhat upsetting.  The flash is adequate, but nothing out of the ordinary and the resulting shots can be a crapshoot of sorts with some looking lovely while others turn out to be nearly unusable.   

Overall though, the good outweighs the bad with this device and I must say I am impressed.  Most photos look great, the technology is better, and the size of the camera works well for me, even as an individual with large hands.  For some further specifications, look below:
