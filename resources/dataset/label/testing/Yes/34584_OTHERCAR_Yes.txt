            I absolutely LOVE my Saturn!  Not only is the car stylish and sporty-looking, it drives like a sports car too.  It has great pick-up and great cornering.  I purchased this car used 2 years ago just because I wanted a new car, and it has only been to the shop for normal maintenance.  The gas mileage is wonderful, and it is very cheap to fill the tank too.  I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty vehicle, but cannot afford to dish out a lot of money for car payments, insurance and maintenance.  The only negative thing about this car is that if you are a tall person you will be cramped for headroom.  <br><br>
