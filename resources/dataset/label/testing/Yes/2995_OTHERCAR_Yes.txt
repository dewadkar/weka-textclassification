            Most people think I have a superior attitude and that my epinions reflect my inflated self image.  But I am here to say that they are all wrong, and that anyone who considered himself above his fellow man would not drive my used Dodge Shadow ES Turbo.

I should preface this review with some background information on my purchase of the lemon-in-question.  I did not buy it from a reputable dealer such as &quot;Jack's House of Cars&quot; or &quot;Lenny's Deals on Wheels&quot;; rather I bought it from a family friend that secured the Dodge at an auto auction.  I also only paid $700 for the little red 2DR with 125,000 miles and a missing rear spoiler.  So in all fairness, I will not profess that my experience is typical of all used Shadows, and will try as best as possible to make good catholic remarks about this most interesting car.

The most positive thing I will say about this car is that it is almost quick.  The normally aspirated version of my beast is an anemic 2.2ltr four-banger rated at an optimistic 93 horsepower.  But on my 2500lb sled, the turbocharger pushes the HP to a much more enjoyable 130 or so.  Which propels this screamer from 0 to traffic ticket in under 10 seconds.  Although most bicycles today will leave the Shadow in the dust, at least most people are surprised that I can pass on the highway.  The car will also continue to accelerate well past 100mph, although after 75 the entire body begins to shake, rattle, and swerve wildly from lane to lane.  Again, I feel this is not endemic of all Shadows and more likely reflects the poor condition of my off-brand &quot;performance&quot; tires.

But the real problem with the ES is not in the engine bay or the tires.  After all, at this many miles, I would actually expect more problems (so far only routine maintenance).  No, the real problem is with the chick-repelling exterior.  Something in the way Dodge machines their doors ensures that they will rub against the front fender and eventually warp and bend.  The effect of this is to make the front half of the car look as if it has been mangled and then repaired callously with steel mallets.  Which is not all that bad as it does distract from the fading paint on the hood (another thing that has plagued several Dodges my friends have owned).  Luckily, I already had a girlfriend when I bought my car, or I would be writing reviews of chat lines and 1-900 numbers.

In the end, I have to say I that no one would buy this car if they wanted to make a strong personal statement about their wealth or position in society.  But given the general reliability, inexpensive insurance, cheap parts, decent handling, nice interior, and surprising power of the Dodge Shadow ES Turbo, I would have to recommend this car to anyone seeking a second vehicle or perhaps a good used car for the kids that won't leave them too embarrassed to drive to school.  Just make sure you're already married or have a great sense of humor.
