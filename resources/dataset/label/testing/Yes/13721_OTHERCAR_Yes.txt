            I was goin to get this car instead of the Acura Integra.  The new look is very smooth and &quot;phat&quot; A whole lot of my friends drive this beauty, and they tell me of what I missed out on.  The car is one powerful beast, and can keep up with many sports car, even though it is a sedan.  It could settle as a family car, or just as someones &quot;phat ride&quot; The car turns heads as I have witnessed.  The car has great handling and amazing breaks as most bmw's do.  It is what you would expect from the german company and much more. It comes with many options including bright halogen lights, Abs breaks and much more.  The limits are endless.  I would recommend that if you are looking for a great car that will last you for a long long time, choose the new bmw 328i. You will not be disapointed<br><br>
