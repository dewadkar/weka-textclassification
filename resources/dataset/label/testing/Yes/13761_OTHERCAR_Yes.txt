            Like most of the reviewers have said, the looks of this truck can't be beat! I bought a 1999 Ram 1500 Quad Cab 4X4 with the 5.8L V8 and looks were the most important quality. I have two kids, so the Quad cab was necessary and since I decided to use it full time, and I do travel a good bit, I went with the 4X4 for winter driving. The first thing that impressed me (beyond the looks) was the ride and handling. This thing rode like a car. I had an old 1981 Chevy pick up and it rode like a truck. My wife, at about 5 feet tall has no problem driving my truck. The only problem as far as her driving the truck I have seen so far is she doesn't want to give it back!

We had a couple of cosmetic problems when I first got the truck. The carpet around the 4WD shift lever was not cut right and the dealer had to order new carpet for the front. Then the rear pull down seat developed what can only be described as a butt dent. A permanent impression on the passenger side. It was like sitting in a bucket. That is where my 11 year old daughter sits and she goes about 60 pounds soaking wet. No adults have ever been in the back, so I don't know how that could have happened. The dealer replaced the entire bench.

I have since had a couple of mechanical problems. The &quot;service engine&quot; light came on one Saturday when I was heading for the river with the family to go fishing. We cancelled the trip and I took the truck in for service first thing Monday. It was a relay valve problem of some sort and it was a quick and easy repair done while I waited by the dealer (under warranty, of course). On Tuesday, I remembered the bait - squid and bloodworms - were still in the cooler from the aborted fishing trip. Bought a new cooler.

The past couple of months, I have noticed the power steering making a bit of a noise. Not a belt type of noise, more of a hydraulic squeal. I was going to take it in to the dealer as soon as I got a chance, but about two weeks ago, I started hearing a pinging type noise usually associated with low octane fuel. I normally burn 87 octane, but tried a tank of 89. It did not help and the pinging got worse. It is only noticeable at more then 2000 RPM's and is pretty loud when going up a steep hill on an interstate or passing another car. I took it into the dealer and after several test rides, the master mechanic said I have a blown intake gasket and something about needing to re-route the plug wires per a service bulletin. The dealer has to order the part, but said the truck is OK to drive, just watch the oil level.

One other word to the wise I just discovered. I purchased the extended warranty and felt secure knowing that it includes a rental car if my truck is in the shop. The problem is, my dealer is booked solid for a week and if the truck were not drivable, they wouldn't even look at it for a week. The rental is only good for the normal duration of the repair. In this case 1 day. I never thought about the dealer not being able to work on it for a week. I am simply out of luck if they can't get to my vehicle right away. Let the buyer beware!
