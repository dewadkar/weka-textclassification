            New echo owner report (serenity_02456) Fri. 14 Jul '00 (7:30 AM) 

Dear fellow Echo owners (and would-be owners),
I've had my little green standard-shift echo two-door for about three weeks (and 1,800 miles) of driving.  It's a dream car. I commute between the city environment of Eastern Mass. and rural Western Mass. I have found the cross-wind performance to be less adverse than reported, and being just a bit more vigilant at the wheel in cross gusts is just
another skill to develop -- no problem there. Ditto being passed (or more likely passing) behemoth trucks traveling either in my direction or whizzing by me going the opposite way on two lane roads. I refer to my Echo as my &quot;litle Lexus.&quot;  The Ford Focus was a contender for my dough, but I believe that the Echo is a more thoroughly engineered and
integrated package. I probably was not as careful about the break-in period as I should have been (as the dealer made no mention of it when I took delivery).  But I haven't &quot;punched&quot; the car, nor do I intend to.  I'm amazed at the power in reserve to pass (and whatnot).  It really is a very
spritely vehicle. The styling in downright cute, even affectionate,and the metallic green is to die for! The sound system is utterly first-rate.
Does this sound like a rave?  I guess it is (and I'm not [nor is anyone I know] a Toyota employee). I've driven my Echo with 5 full-sized passengers
with no complaints as to comfort coming from rear seat occupants.
Two other impressions I wish to share:  The backlit console display (kind of a moonglow color) is very relaxing to the eye during night driving. There is an elegant simplicity to the display as well.  I also really like the central location of it.  It is much easier to move vision back and forth from the road to the display, because the range of focal travel is much less. Easier to glance to the side to read the console info than to have to look down through the steering wheel and shorten up one's focus.  there's just much less eye strain the way Toyota does it with the Echo.
The other impression is stems from some extended driving.  I'm out there on the super slab, and whirring all around me are gas-guzzling SUV's, en route to extinction (though they don't know it!).  And I'm in my little Echo, a highly adaptable little furry mammalian (to push the metaphor).  I'm the wave of the future, already establishing a workable niche in the hostile present -- and I KNOW IT! It gives me the chills to just think of it!
In closing, the Echo is one great little machine and I recommend it highly. I just wanted to check in with this review.  I consulted the postings here before I bought, and wanted to give something
back.
                                Best wishes to all,
                                --Serenity<br><br>
