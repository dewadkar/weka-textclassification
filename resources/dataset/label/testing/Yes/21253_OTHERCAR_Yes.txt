            From the very first time I sat in it, a very familiar, cozy and warm feeling came over me.  I'd scarcely been in a Toyota before and certainly never sat in a Camry.  But sitting in Camry's luxurious drivers seat, I felt immediately at home.  Nestled in that seat, test driving at night (I always test drive at night), I felt somehow protected and secure, like I had a major substantial car surrounding me.  Very unlike other cars in this class that felt lighter and less substantial i.e. Accord.  Several models of the Accord are a good 200 to 300 pounds (or more) lighter than the Camry LE.  And from what I found, Honda dealerships wanted significantly more money for what appeared to be less metal, even when you compare Corolla with Civic.  The Corolla CE +++ is a heavier car than many models of the Civic.  Toyota seems to build heavier cars (except for the ill-fated Echo), and then is more willing to negotiate in price on them, than the inflexible Honda people. All of this plus the legendary Toyota reliability; what more could you want?  Looks and image.

The image of the Camry seems to be very classy.  Well, it's certainly not a down-scale, &quot;down and out&quot; car is it?  Camry-Classy, Classy-Camry; it sort of rhymes doesn't it?  And so you'd think this car might appeal more to older, conservative people right?  Yet, there are major, major, whole groups of high school and college students driving this car!  Why?  Because for all the convenience of a Mid-Sized sedan, you are getting a car that looks much less clunkier than others in it's class. The Camry seems to have much sleeker and symmetrical lines than say, a bulky, ungainly Chevy Malibu.  Toyota even admits that Camry is built on the same platform (chasis) as the Lexus.  For the money, wouldn't you rather have a glorified Lexus ES300, than a glorified god-only-knows what else?  I know I would!  That's why I'm crying right now for not having the sense to buy it when I could of.  Please, Please, Please don't make the same mistake I did.  Trust your intuition and get this car!<br><br>
