            My wife and I bought this car brand new in 1994. There were a number of factors that were behind our decision, however the most important one was the price. Alternatives were the Dodge Neon and Honda Civic. The 1994 is the last model with the old body design which I tend to like more. Starting in 1995 the body design changed and became extremely similar to that of Corolla's. Of course, in 1999, Toyota stopped the production of Tercel completely. The 1994 Toyota Tercel 2 Door Sedan has a 1.5 Liter, 4-Cylinder engine and a 4 Speed Manual Transmission.

We have been extremely happy with the car. It has very good mileage, lower 30s in the city and mid to upper 30s on the highway consistently. It has been very reliable, no major problems except for normal wear and tear. I find the Tercel's front seats to be more comfortable, and the instrument panel to be more visible and logical, when compared to both the Neon and the Civic.

Of course, being a low-end car it has several disadvantages. The original tires are more like bicycle tires (145/80R13). We changed them with 155/80R13, the only other option the manufacturer allows. I would recommend this change to make the car more stable and safer on the road. Also, the Tercel lacks a fuel indicator, so if you are forgetful about putting fuel in your car, you have no warning before you run out of gas! Third, while the trunk has a respectable volume for the size of the car, the trunk opening is designed poorly so things that may fit in can't get through its opening! Finally, it is considerable noisy.

However, you can't beat its price and reliability!
