            The Chrysler PT Cruiser is one of those cars you expect to see right out a gangster movie minus the bright yellow color.  The PT Cruiser was first released at the 1999 Detroit Auto Show as a concept car.  However, as car enthusiasts know, many of Chrysler's concepts become production vehicles (e.g. Viper, Prowler, PT).

Note, as of me writing this (January 2000) the PT is not yet available.  Keep this in mind when you read other reviews in this section.  But on I go...

I first saw the PT cruiser at the 1999 Auto Show.  My first observation was that it was much smaller than it looks on TV.  The length of the vehicle is about the length of a Neon.  The height of the car is a little less than that of a Jeep and it is not raised off the ground as much.

I was unable to see the inside of the vehicle, nor was I able to drive it.  My main reason for writing this epinion is to warn you to be careful when you read the reviews about the PT cruiser because this car is not being sold yet, and therefore it would be impossible for anyone to write a comprehensive review at this time.  Come back in a few months...

The below was added on January 16, 2000 after me trip to the 2000 Detroit Auto Show:

I was able to see the inside of the vehicle.  The PT Cruiser can hold five people.  There is a fair amount of leg room for the back seat.  The rear seats also fold down to to extend the trunk.  The passenger seat in front can also fold downing allowing a 2 x 4 to fit in the car with the trunk closed.  The size of the trunk is fair.  It is probably around three grocery bags deep.  When the passenger seat folds down, there is a desk like area on the back of the seat that the driver can use for things like a notebook computer (although it is not really safe to use it and drive at the same time).  There are cup holders in both the front and back of the vehicle.  All in all, the interior was pretty nice.

The bas model sells for a little less than $15,000, while the Limited Edition (with leather seats and fully loaded) sell for just under $20,000.  There will be around 185,000 of the PT Cruiser made this year, with a demand well above that, I believe.  If you want one, try and order it now.  This is a great car for a young driver, but you have to like the look.<br><br>
