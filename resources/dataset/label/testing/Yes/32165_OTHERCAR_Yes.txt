            Just this past weekend I acquired my 1999 Chevy Cavalier for 10,000 difference and an old beat up '89 Subaru Justy.  I being 19 already have a complete stereo system and wasn't really interested in what any vehicle had to offer in that point of view but the 4 6x9 system impressed me a lot.  I have decided to cut out the 2 6&quot; Kicker Impulse mid-range speakers and just leave the 4-6x9's.  Being as my previous vehicle was a 89 Justinator.. this is a real big jump for me.. *an entire cylinder :)* What really brought me to look at the Cav's were that my friend had purchased a 91 this summer and I took it for a ride from time to time and liked how the car and I worked together..  not like the 96 Pontiac Sunfire GT I test drove.  the shifter made my elbow bend because it was pretty much at my hip and made for an uncomfortable drive.  A lot of jump too.. I am a delivery driver and while doing my many many tests these past 2 nights I managed to get up to 100km/h within a block. In second gear u can get these babies up to 90.  That I liked because while sporting my stereo system I like to add to it by blowing the doors off of vehicles that the passengers find my system impressive. My car is pretty basic.. not even air conditioning.. although the climate control in it is still nice for keeping my windows fog-less while going from hot to cold constantly throughout the night(steam from pizza bags) and all I have to say about what it lacks are 1. It could use more horsepower 2. more of a manly horn 3. nicer rims    like I said the horsepower is more than liveable as is.. the horn is a dinky little beep and the rims are plastic and an eye-sore to look at.. I'm not stating that a basic cav should come with sweet ass gold daitons but something more than plastic.
