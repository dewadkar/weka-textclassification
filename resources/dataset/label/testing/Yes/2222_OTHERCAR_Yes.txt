            The Suzuki Vitara 2dr convertible is a great vehicle for driving in city traffic. We have an automatic with a/c, CD player and we added a security system which includes keyless entry.

This car gets 23mph in the city.  Our primary use is driving back and forth to work and the grocery store(the rear door opens to the storage area behind the rear seats and holds 4 or 5 grocery bags with ease.)

The Vitara is fun to drive, especially with the top down!  The air conditioner works well and the heater really delivers the heat!  Our Nebraska winter challenges any car heater and the Suzuki heater worked really well!

We have driven on the interstate at 75mph with ease; the engine demonstrated it could handle higher speeds with ease. Our other vehicle is a mid sized SUV and the comments made here are based in part on that fact.
