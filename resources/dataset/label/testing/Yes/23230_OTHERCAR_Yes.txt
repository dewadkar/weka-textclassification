            I lucked up and purchased a 1996 Plymouth Breeze in February of 1997. It had 7000 miles on it which qualified it to be a used vehicle, I got a great price and the car, while compact has a large trunk space, plenty of leg room on the inside and drives like a dream. Upkeep of this car is at a minimum, keep the oil changed and get a tune up once a year and like the battery bunny, it just keeps goin' and goin' and goin' One of the problems I hate is that I have taken this car back to the dealer numerous of times for recall issues. The manufacturer needs to pay attention to this to ensure that the customer feels safe in the car they purchased. Even with the numerous recalls I would highly recommend this car for women who needs room but likes a compact car.<br><br>
