            This is my absolute favorite car ever to roll off of any assembly line.  The Mustang is just, simply put, the best idea any car company could have come up with, it's just that Ford beat them all to it.

The gas mileage, even with a V8 under the hood, is excellent.  Mine ranges from 24 to 28 miles to the gallon, depending on how much I show off and kick it in the butt.  You can find them with a V6 also, but this kind of car was designed to have a V8, otherwise it just doesn't feel like a Mustang anymore.

The handling is great on this car, I usually notice that with Ford vehicles they seem to have somewhat sloppy steering.  But, to be all honest, I have yet to notice any in the Mustang.  The steering is not to tight and not too loose, and there is no play at all.  It will respond as soon as the wheel is moved.

As most people would guess, the car does have a very quick acceleration rate, and if you thrive on that sort of thing, it will peel out (for quite a while too, but tires are your problem).

The ride is quiet, and the seats are comfortable (in the front at least).  This is an all around great car!<br><br>
