            Interior space is quite generous, especially for rear seat passengers. The Leather seats are firm and comfortable on long drives, with plenty of thigh support. The three driver memory seat is great for multi-driver families. The seats, steering wheel and headrest are all electronically controlled and you will clearly find a suitable comfort position. The right side mirror scans down to aid in seeing garage doors and curbs when in reverse mode. The cup holders are only adequate for the smallest cups or cans. There is a very handy rechargeable flashlight in the glove compartment. The stereo system is more than adequate, although the six pack CD player in the trunk area is somewhat annoying due to the impossible access while driving. The storage area has a roller cover that hides valuables in the back. There is also a small lockable compartment below the storage floor for storing smaller items. Along with the roller cover, there is a screen that rolls up to prevent items that are stored in the back compartment from flying forward during heavy breaking (including pets). This unit also provides some rigidity for side impacts.  There are side, front and "A" pillar air bags as well as in the steering wheel for added safety. Air conditioning and heater ventilation are very good. In winter, the high speed defrost setting is extremely effective.  The cruise control and radio control buttons on the steering hub are a great convenience feature.  In colder climates the heated steering wheel is FANTASTIC. Of course the three level heated seats are also a joy on those cold nights. The electric rear hatch means that you don't have to slam the lid to get it to close. The rear window lifts up for easy access to smaller items. 

The wagon is much more spacious than the BMW X5 SUV with 14.5 to 53.9 cubic feet of rear storage. And unlike SUV's it doesn't have the roll over potential looming over your head. The sport car like handling is much more secure and comfortable for every day driving. 

The 2.8 litre inline six is a bullet proof engine that is extremely willing to rev. Plenty of torque for sporty driving in a WAGON. The engine delivers 193 horsepower and 206 pounds of torque, providing for very safe freeway entry and highway passing. Handling is secure, confident predictable and sport car like. The 5 Speed manual transmission is very smooth if only a little notchy. I am getting around 8.7 litres per 100 kilometres (over 30 MPG) on pure highway driving and around 11.3 to 11.7 litres per 100 kilometres in combined city/highway driving. The car is equipped with ABS Breaks for secure stopping in inclemant weather. The standard halogen lights are very good, although if you can find a car with optional xenon headlamps they are very worthwhile. 

If you are living in northern climates, snow tires as a second set of tires are a must. With this feature and the traction control, you can manage just about anything that winter can throw at you. 

This car was purchased as part of the BMW Certified series plan which extends the warranty on the power and drive train to 120,000 total kilometres on the car or two years, which ever comes first. 

The styling of this car is very classical and handsome. I expect that it should withstand the test of time for years to come. 

I am most appreciative of you taking the time to comment on this review.
