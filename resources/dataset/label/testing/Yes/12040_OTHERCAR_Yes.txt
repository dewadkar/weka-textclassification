            Sales of mid-priced sports cars have flown through the roof recently.  With cars like the Boxter, Mercedes CLK, and looming Jaguar F-Type, is the Honda S2000 worth a purchase?  Well it depends who you are...

First off, this is the cheapest of the prior mentioned cars, with a price tag of 32k.  It sounds like a steal over the 45k Boxters and such, but do you really get your moneys worth?  The S2000 only has a 2.0L 4 cylinder engine, and although it can output 240 horsepower, some people just don't like the feel of it.  Don't get me wrong, this is a top notch sports car, but against the likes of so many other cars in it's class, just doesn't offer anything new.  (except for the nifty PUSH BUTTON start!)  

The inside, like any sportscar, is a bit cramped, but liveable and driveable.  The interior is decent and simple, and has impressive electronic instruments.  (The speedometer is digitally done)  All in all, there really is not anything new.

So to recap, this is a great car, but offers nothing special in the mid-priced sports car class.  These are fun to drive, but so are BMW Z3's...<br><br>
