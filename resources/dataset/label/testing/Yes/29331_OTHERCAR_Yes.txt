            Rudy, If you notice my 2nd opinion of our 1999 Chevy Tracker, you'll notice this name had nothing to do with the TV show "Survivor."  Then maybe again, it did?  Two weeks ago, Rudy was rear ended by a late model behemoth Suburban.  Surprisingly, the rear swing door was all that was damaged.  The "Sub" was more damage than our Rudy.  Rudy kind of bounced away from the big boy...the clear winner of Survival!  Insurance paid $1075 and the dent and repaint cost me only $200.00 to fix.  That sure helped with a few payments.  Rudy has over 17,000 miles now.  Runs like a champ and we've had no other problems.  The kids are getting bigger and are starting to want more room in back, but Rudy is still great for around town.  We still like Rudy and don't plan on replacing him for a long time.  Till next time, buy whatever you like and if you treat it right, you'll all do just fine.
