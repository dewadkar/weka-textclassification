            This happens to be my mom's new car and it sure is fun to drive. With many of the same features as the Thunderbird, it does have a few drawbacks. The rear window is very small and difficult to see out of. Unlike the Thunderbird rear window which gradually slants downward and provides perfect visibility, the designers at Mercury decided to have a short, sawed-off rear window which creates a huge blind spot out the back. 

The car has a very powerful engine (the same one found in a Mustang GT) and it gets the car up to speed in a hurry. You often hear commercials talking about the power of a V6 engine, well they obviously haven't seen a V8. This car will snap your head back in the seat if you tromp the gas as the engine emits a satisfying roar and the car leaps forward.

The performance comes at a price. You get poor fuel economy in this car and the gas tank is relatively small as well. 

The center console is difficult to open because it opens from the side and not the front (this also makes access for the passenger difficult). 

The car has posi-traction which may not have been a good thing in winter. The back end would easily slide out if you stepped too hard on the gas. On a car without posi-traction, the back end doesn't slide out nearly as fast or as dramatically. It is very difficult to keep this car planted on the road in snowy conditions and I would recommend storing it if you live in a colder climate. The weight distribution on the car with the V8 has to be heavily forward.

I have never figured out why car manufacturers don't put the engine in the rear and keep rear wheel drive. If anyone knows why nobody does this (other than racing cars) please tell me. It's already a proven fact that rear engine, rear drive cars have better handling and control so what gives?

Finally, the size of the car makes it difficult to navigate some of today's tiny parking lots. 

The price was also somewhat steep.
