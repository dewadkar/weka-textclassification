I bought my Mercury used two years ago, and have never regretted it.  Its sleek design is attractive to both my company and me personally.  I bought one that was pretty loaded, and enjoy the features, as a matter of fact the only thing my car is missing is the sunroof.  

Additional Features
Mercury does well on their additions. It was worth buying it with their good stereo with C.D. player and JLB speakers.  The sound is awesome in the car, great for long drives or traffic crunches.  I have never bought a factory stereo that�s top of the line because they are usually way overpriced and do not compare in quality to what you can buy at an electronics store.  Mercury though sells a wonderful stereo with great sound to my surprise.  Another of my favorite features is the quick access combo on the driver�s door.  Alls you have to do is enter your car combo to unlock the door, all the doors, or even open the trunk.  Another great Ford-Mercury feature is the remote control unlocker/trunk opener/panic button unit that comes on a key chain.  I amaze people sometimes when I walk out of the grocery store and open my trunk from five or six cars away.  Also one of the most useful features is the automatic headlights, they go on in the dark and turn off when you turn off the car or in the light.  This is helpful to some people who forget to turn off the lights once they leave the car.  Another nice feature is that there are ac vents in the back seat as well as in the front, and the climate control feature is very quick to respond.

Realistic Opinion on Gas:
Gas wise it�s a middle of the line vehicle.  It costs me roughly 20 bucks to fill it up.  It goes about 270-300 regular miles per tank, which is about what I drive in a week.

Mechanics:
I haven't had anything done to my car yet and I'm 83,000 miles.  I haven't even had a tune up and they say I don't need one until at least 100,000 miles.  The car is incredibly easy to take care of.  One thing that I have noticed about it though is that the c.v. joints seem to crack a little more often in these cars.  I did have one replaced and another one is on its way to needing it.  The other thing is that the power steering in my car and my friends same year same car whines when you turn the wheel hard.  Not a normal whine, but a noticeable noise.  

Space:
One of the reasons I bought the car is that I'm 6'4&quot; and most cars including the Accord and Acura just don't offer the space I need as a tall person.  This car has wonderfully adjustable seats (especially if you pay for the feature). I have many times fit 5 people in the car, and there is always enough room for everyone.  This is helpful for entertaining.   The trunk is wide but not deep, and this is one of the major set backs I have had on liking the car at times.  I have a full size spare which causes the trunk to be even more suffocated.  This is important to take into consideration for anyone using the trunk for more then just a grocery hauler.

What my car looks like:
My car is midnight blue, with gray leather interior.  It has an advanced stereo, and premium wheels. 

I enjoy this car, and I hope you do to.  I have read other reviews on this, and they are mixed, but I have had mine for over 2 years now and it has been totally reliable.  One comment I will make in closing is that you should never buy a used rental car version of this (or any) car because of the abuse they 90% of the time have (just refer to any consumer report magazine's auto buyer helper handbook, they agree 100%).  Many times when people buy these previously rented cars they think that the problems that come with them are a result of a badly manufactured car when in fact they are the fault of countless people terrorizing the vehicle in many different ways.  Just a note, while you may pay a little less for this kind of previously rented car, you will pay more in the long run.

I hope this was a helpful review.
