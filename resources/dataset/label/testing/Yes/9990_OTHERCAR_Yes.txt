            I own a 1996 GMC SLS Sonoma 4x4.  This truck may not be the largest truck out there but it packs one powerful punch.  I purchased this truck when I started college.  It seemed like a logical choice, because in my price range the Jimmy and Yukon where just to expensive.  Gmc makes a great automobile.  From the second I stepped on the lot, to every time I start up my truck I am pleased with how I spent my money.  This truck with a V-6 Vortec engine has all the power of a truck in a more compact 4x4.  And the best part about it was I got it loaded with A/C, CD player, alarm, and a bed liner.  Everything I could want for one great price.  If your in the line for a new truck that is not to big, but has great power and style try a Sonoma.  But take my advice get the King-Cab, because that is one thing I did not get and let me tell you it stinks when you have two people in the truck and bags.  And if it rains, it is all over.  This truck drives like a car, but it has TRUCK written all over it.  I have had my fair share of cars, and this is by far the best to date.  But always test drive the car and do the research, because people differ and my opinion might not fit your needs.  But the GMC Sonoma SLS 4x4 is a reliable and overall excellent truck.<br><br>
