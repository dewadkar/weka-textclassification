            After brooding over the various models of digital camera to get, I bought a 780c at Fry's Electronics for $200. I was pleased from the first use. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's tough, simple to use, fun, and capable of surprisingly good detail in its images. The controls are the buttons and switches on the camera body and the list of options presented in text on the LCD screen in options mode. These options are not extensive, but they enable you to, for example, delete a picture if you don't like the way it looks on the LCD screen. The wide-angle lens allows macrophotography - I was able to press the camera against the side of a friend's fishtank and get a detailed and interesting image of the tank's interior and residents. As far as drawbacks, the CCD has a color temperature sensitivity different than film and may need correction in very low or very bright settings. It is sensitive to infrared, which shows up as a bluish haze, although I never encountered this phenomenon.

You can order the 780c through vendors such as PC Warehouse, as well as the web camera sellers. They also sell for inflated sums on Ebay, where people regularly pay $240 or so for them for the thrill of engaging in bidding wars. 

I liked mine so much I sold it - to buy an Agfa 1680, the big brother to the 780c.
