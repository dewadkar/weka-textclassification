            A very well made car! Would recommend it to anyone. This is a solid capable automobile that has the styling to match. Love the new color (Light Metallic Almond). Tires that came with the car (Good Year Eagle LS) grip the road very well. The 2.4 L engine is suitable but could use some more low end torque and horsepower. The power window switches need to be put where they belong, on the the door panels! The car handles very well around corners but could use some lumbar support in the seats to keep the driver more firmly in place. Fit and Finish on the Cruiser is excellent. The doors shut with a solid thump. Cabin Noise is minimal. Turning radius could be improved also.
