            I originally bought this camera to take pictures of things that I was selling on-line.  It really seemed to be easier to show a picture instead of describing it the best that I could.  
Since I have bought the camera - I have used it for so many other occasions than what I planned.  I now use it for my daughter's special events, vacations, holidays etc.  
The reason why I chose this camera over all the other ones out on the market was because of the ease of using the floppy disk - you take the pictures, pop the disk out of the camera and pop it into your computer and wa la - there you are !!
The clarity has been just fine for us thus far - I haven't had any complaints.<br><br>
