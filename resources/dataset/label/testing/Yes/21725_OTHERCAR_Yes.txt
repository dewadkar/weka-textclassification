            I bought my '98 Cavalier last year with 33,000 miles on the odometer.  I got a great deal - the dealer gave me $2500 trade in on a dying, 16 year old Blazer, which brought the price of the car down to $6495 (already marked down due to hail damage.)  I had gone onto the lot wanting to ditch the old Blazer and get cheap, dependable wheels and I came out driving Shirley, a black 1998 Cavalier, two door, with a 2.2 litre 4 cylinder mated with 3 speed automatic transmission and a copious amount of dimples on the body caused by a recent hailstorm (of the non-Microsoft variety).  She now has 78k on the odometer, and hasn't given me a lick of trouble (knock on wood.)  I am overdue on routine maintenence, which will shortly be rectified, but I've kept the oil changed and decent gas in the fuel tank and have been rewarded with faithful service.  Oh, and two cans of freon a couple of days ago to recharge the A/C at a total cost of $25.

First the good points.  

1.  This car looks good for an economy car.  Two doors look best, four door Cavaliers look kind of odd to me.

2. 27 - 31 miles per gallon, mixed highway driving with some city driving, rush hour stop and go, and rural road driving.  

3.  While not a powerhouse, I get plenty of go when I need it.  Often, the Cavalier is the first off the line at a stop light, and that's with me taking it easy on the accelerator.  This car is plenty quick, and has enough oomph for passing, merging on the freeway from the entrance ramp, and dodging maniacal SUV drivers.

4.  She handles very well, almost like a low end sports car.  Manuevering on the freeway is very easy, and she's very easy to tuck into a parking space.  

6.  Air conditioner blows C-O-L-D.

5.   This is rather anecdotal, but in the past week I've been driving a big white Monte Carlo and have suffered drivers blocking me, speeding up to keep me from passing, and all that good stuff.  This is typical bad driving for Houston, and I'd almost forgotten about it.  It seems like the Cavalier is so subtle that people don't notice her and don't think to put the block on her before it's too late.

The bad stuff:

1.  Backseat is cramped.  I'm 5'6, and when riding in the back I have to slouch or my head will bang the roof.  Not a whole lot of leg room back there, either.

2.  The seats are cloth, and they don't *look* particularly cheap, but they seem to stain very easily for some reason, even with very light wear.  The seats looked kinda grimy when I bought the car, and I was able to get them a little cleaner, but after a year of use they look terrible.  Even the front passenger seat, which rarely has anyone sitting in it.  Backseat looks okay, though, and I found tiger striped seat covers for $3 apiece, so problem solved.

3.  The seats aren't very generously padded.  When crawling around in the backseat, cleaning, I can feel bars under the seat.  After about two hours of driving, things can start to get a bit uncomfortable.  And forget about sleeping in the car.  I took a recent road trip and we presented quite a picture at the rest stop - seats reclined back with a pair of legs sticking out each window.

In my case, I got a great deal, and I'm quite happy with the car.  If it holds up past 150k, there is not a single thing more I could ask.  In fact, I've always thought of Fords as being more reliable, but if my baby does last 150k or longer, I will be buying a new Cavalier when the time comes to replace her.
