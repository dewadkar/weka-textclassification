                I Purchased my 97 cavalier as a demo a little over 3 years ago for only one reason, Good gas mileage.  What i got was a great car that has put up with my stop and go city driving that totals a little over 37,000 miles.  This cavalier has also done great going over 95 miles an hour constantly from North Texas all the way to Las Vegas, Nevada.  Some of the outstanding features include great A/C system, plenty of room and one of the best factory stereo systems i have ever had the pleasure of hearing. 
    Some features not worth mentioning are a very faulty horn, a somewhat not so smooth ride and a peppy but definitely not impressive acceleration score.  
    Overall, i rate my Cavalier very high.  This has been a great car for insane city driving and fast cross country driving that has never let me down.  A Cavalier is a top quality car that should be considered for purchase<br><br>
