            I'll admit it: Where possible I like to patronize American brands.  However, I will only do so when their products are competitive.  Often, they are not (as many of my reviews conclude).  When they are, it is often because a foreign subsidiary was heavily involved in or contributed to the development of the car.  

This is the case with my own car, a Ford Contour, which was developed by Ford of Europe.  As a result, this car has a German feel, which I like.  Unfortunately, few Americans cared for the Contour, so it is being discontinued in North America.  Will my next car have to be foreign?  Perhaps.

But perhaps not.  I was intrigued when I learned that Saturn was basing its new mid-sized car on the Opel Vectra.  This seemed odd, since the Vectra was actually a smaller car than the small Saturn, the SL.  On the other hand, the Vectra also served as the basis for both Saabs, including the fairly large 9-5.  So the possibility emerged that the new Saturn would offer the dynamics and comfort of a European luxury car at American prices.

My sister is kind of looking for a car, so I took the opportunity to drive a Saturn LS2 with her.  It will not be my next car, and will probably not be hers either.  But it still may be the right car for you.  It�s a good car.  It�s just not my kind of car.

First, the good stuff.  Many American cars have been plagued with interiors of dubious quality.  My sister is most picky in this area.  She has written off a large number of American cars for just this reason.  But not the LS2.  Its interior is very nice, the nicest I have experienced in an American car that was not a Cadillac.  I drove this car a day after driving a Passat and Jetta, both of which have been rightly praised for their interiors.  I felt that the LS2 interior did not suffer in comparison.  Neither did my sister.  The Saturn steering wheel is a bit dowdy, but the curves in the center stack are more artful than the rather severe lines found in the VWs.  The Saturn wood is fake, while that in the VWs is real, but it is just as nice looking.  All of the materials appear to be of high quality.  I wish that the interior in my wife�s Intrigue was this nice.  

One part of the interior deserves special mention.  If you�ve read my Intrigue review, you know I hate the hard vinyl armrest on the driver�s door.  It makes my elbow sore on long drives.  This is partly because I am used to driving a manual, so I tend to drive with only my left hand on the wheel.  You will find a similar armrest in many American cars, even some expensive ones, and in many non-American ones as well.  I guess they're designed by lazy slushbox-only people.

What do I want?  Well, the padded cloth armrest found in my Contour is a nice start.  But what�s really nice is a padded leather armrest.  One like you�ll find in a Lexus LS400.  I found one of these in the VWs.  This is uncommon for an under $30k car.  This is the sort of thing these VWs are praised for.  Guess what?  The Saturn has one, too.  In an under $25k car.  A very nice surprise.  It is one sign of the steps Saturn took to make this an amazingly nice interior.

The leather seats are fairly firm but comfortable, front and rear.  There is not a huge amount of room, but there is enough.  The cabin is narrower than that in a Taurus or Intrigue, but about the same width as that in an Accord, Camry, or Passat.  The trunk is very large, and the rear seats fold down to create a pass-through (though the size of this pass-through could be a bit larger).  The view out from the driver�s seat is above average, better than that in a Passat or Audi A6, which have high cowls and beltlines that give you that �in a bathtub� feeling, but about the same as that in a Camry or Accord.

Other good stuff: this car has the plastic panels Saturns are known for.  Well, mostly.  Since this car was based on the Vectra rather than created from scratch, the rear quarter panels, which are an integral part of the unibody, are steel.  The doors and front fenders, however, are plastic.  This will help them resist dents.  They are the panels most likely to be hit at any rate.

On the performance front, the V6 accelerates well and makes pleasant enough (if not inspiring) noises.  This is basically the same engine you�ll find in the Cadillac Catera, but hauling over 500 fewer pounds.  The ride is fluid yet well-controlled, much like you�d find in a Camry.  In this area it is also superior to my wife�s Intrigue, and far superior to my Contour or an Alero.  The brakes have a respectable firmness to them.

All of this sounds quite good.  So why isn�t this the car for my sister and me?

First, the reason it�s not her kind of car: the exterior styling.  The exterior is, in a word, boring.  It measures up to that of a Camry or Accord.  These are cars designed to offend as few people as possible.  The only potentially controversial styling detail on the LS2 is the full-width rear taillight.  Many people, my sister included, don't like those.  But none of these cars� styling has the cuteness that distinguishes the Jetta or the sophistication that distinguishes the Passat.  You begin to sense that Saturn focused a bit too strongly on the Japanese.  

To their credit, Saturn seems to have recognized this.  Recently they announced that their styling will be more distinctive in the future.  I advise them to hurry.  If they want to make my sister happy (and my wife, too, for that matter) make it cute.

Actually, I sensed that this car was not going to be my kind of car well before I drove it.  I sensed that it was going in the wrong direction for me.  I can tell you when I realized this: when I learned that the V6 would not be available with a manual transmission.  If you read your Contour review, you�ll learn that what I want in a sedan is a DOHC V6 with a manual.  There are not many such sedans available anymore, and once the Contour is gone there will be none from an American manufacturer.  I hoped and hoped the LS would offer such a powertrain.  Alas, it does not.

The LS fails in other areas as well, at least for me.  You see, it is not a very sporting car.  In all fairness, it was not intended to be one.  It was meant to be a bit more sporting than a Camry or Accord, but no bargain BMW or even bargain Audi.  The chassis is well-balanced and easy to control, but it lacks the edge found in a true sports sedan.  It will take curves aggressively, but does not ask to be driven this way.  The seats are flat and nearly devoid of lateral support, at least with leather.  And there�s the homely steering wheel, already mentioned.  

Luckily for Saturn, most American drivers are not like me.  If they were, most Contours would have been sold with a V6 and manual transmission, and the car would have been a great success.  Instead, most Contours were sold with a four and automatic (often to Hertz), and the car flopped.  This is because most Americans value comfort over sporty handling.  They want to relax while driving, not work a clutch and shifter.  VW may be hot right now, but Honda and Toyota are not afraid.  They know what most Americans like, and that is what they provide.  Now Saturn does too.  If you are this kind of driver, and are considering a Camry or Accord, you should also look at the Saturn LS.  You will find the car to be surprisingly pleasant, especially inside.  And the dealership experience cannot be beat.
