            We bought this car used, in 1993.  It's a two-door Sentra, 1990.  My husband basically uses it to commute 80 miles round trip, 5 days a week to work.  When we bought the car, it had about 40,000 miles on it.  Well, now it has in excess of 180,000.  The only big repair bill ($300) was some about 4 years ago.  Since then, we've had tune-ups, oil changes and new tires several times.  It's starting to look a bit beat up, but it's still a great running car.  We get an average of 25 miles to the gallon (mostly St.Louis and Interstate driving).  For a car we paid $4,000 for, we have certainly gotten our money's worth!

We plan to drive this car until the wheels fall off!  We had always heard that Nissans would be more costly to repair.  That certainly hasn't been the case with this one.  Everything my daughter and I have learned about routine car maintenance (oil checking, changing, putting in a battery, etc) we learned on this car.  For that reason alone, we sort of have a sentimental attachment to it.  I'm a big believer in knowing how to do as much as possible yourself, and we figure we must know what we're doing-it's still running great!  <br><br>
