            I have had the fortunate opportunity to purchase a 2002.5 Volkswagen Jetta 1.8T recently. It is by far my favorite car. I have had it for a little over 3 months and it never stops impressing me.

For 2002 the engines have been changed but the trim level remains the same
GL (stripped out Jetta) ~ 2.0 litre engine w/ 115bhp
GLS ~ 2.0, 1.8T (180BHP turbo charged engine), or a V6 (174BHP)
GLX (fully loaded) ~ V6

I drove the 6 cylidner and turbo charged four cylinder, and let me tell you, nothing but smiles on both. The turbo however seems somewhat quicker. The GLS 1.8T comes with a Tiptronic transmission for the auto driver who wants the best of both world; automatic and stick shift. 

The GL comes with steel wheels, no power windows, no sunroof, and no anything. But if someone wants a Jetta bad enough, they can usually be purchased for about 18000 out the door. The GLS is an upgrade from the GL, and comes standard with full power, upgraded seats, and a sleu of other goodies. The only other upgrades that can be made to the GLS are, leather package; 800$, spoiler; 400$, 17" wheels; 400$,sports suspension; 800$, luxury package (sunroof and 15" alloys)1100$, and the Tiptronic transmission 1100$. I opted for the luxury package and the tiptronic transmission, and the turbo charged engine and i paid 21000 out the door. The GLX combines every one of these features, except the 17" alloys and spoiler. It does also come with climatronic, which is a digital climate control. 

The stock Monsoon stereo is the best I have ever heard. It has crisp sound and hard bass. It comes stock with 8 speakers, even in the GL (2 highs, 4 mids, 2 lows, 2 subs.)

For the people who like to mod their cars and get more horsepower out of it, hp can be added very cheaply to the turbo-charged engine. An Upsolute chip costing only 275$ will increase the horsepower by 40bhp and torque to over 60lbs. !!! (Please contact Chris Green, South Florida) Incredible for only 275$ 

I myself have a Cold air intake, downpipe, chip, and I am pushing about 210bhp to the wheels, and about 250 to the crank. As well, I am pushing about 240 lbs. torque to the wheels, and 270ish to the crank.

Everything about this car is great. Especially at night when the illuminated dash comes on. shades of purple, blue, and red light the cabin. (This is what basically got me into a Volkswagen). 

The warranty was boosted from 2 years (2001 year) to 4 years.

There is nothing that Volkswagen left out from the Jetta. I will be keeping this car until the day it dies
