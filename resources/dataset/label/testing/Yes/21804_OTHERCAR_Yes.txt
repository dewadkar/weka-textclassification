            Averaging just over 3500 miles a month for the last 3 years, my Pontiac minivan has pulled its duty as a family vehicle.  The extended van has enough room for my family of five and their constant flow of friends to accomodate with comfort that you would expect in a minivan and when the off time comes that I have the opportunity to get out on the town with just my wife, I don't feel completely stupid driving a family truckster.  

A couple of small but legitimate concerns about the usability of the vehicle.  First, the leveling package has been undependable.  The relays are not heavy enough to carry the load of the air compressor and the unit has required repair three different times.  Pontiac has picked up the tab on this repair so far, but it seems to be a design problem for such regular reoccurrence. Also, the reclining seats function with a nice solid feel and I thought that I was going to really like the non-flimsy design.  However, my children have been able to roll the seats back, but can never get them back upright without intervention.  

The van has serviced me well and is extremely comfortable even on extended trips with multiple adults.    <br><br>
