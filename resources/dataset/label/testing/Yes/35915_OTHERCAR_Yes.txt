            I bought my 1991 MR2 about 2 years ago right before college, it is a non-turbo model and I absolutley LOVE this car.  I bought it because I wanted an affordable sports car and I wasn't about to settle for anything less than rear wheel drive, midengine, reliable, and a chick magnet.  Hard target?  No way my MR2 has met every single demand and I've put 35,000 HARD miles on it (now at 124,000 miles) and the only work its needed were wear items like tires, brake pads, a new clutch at 100,000, and 3 ball joints  at $30 a pop!  My advice is to try and get one of the metallic colors as the clear coat really keeps the car looking new, my car is 10 years old and looks brand new inside and out with a good detailing every 6 monthes.

Go join the Internet MR2 Club (http://www.mr2.com), they not only tell you how to find the perfect MR2, common problems with fixes, but they get you discounts, host MR2 meets regionally, and you won't find a single person that isn't in love with the car once they buy it, seriously!

Driving the car is unbelievable, no car under $10,000 drives like it, nothing handles like it due to the independant suspension and mid-engine design (only the Acura NSX and Ferrari's etc have such a layout, and those cost WAY MORE), it does well on the race track too and there is a huge aftermarket for it.  There is no doubt it will become a collectors car as many enthusiats have said. Sitting in the car is like sitting in a airplane cockpit, you'll see what I mean when you sit in one.

The only draw backs to a car like this are lack of storage space, it is a sports car after all, and the T-tops are known to leak slightly after years of neglect on the rubber trim, but there are easy fixes (Black silicone rubber on top of the seals) and you can always replace the seals from the dealer.  Do know that in the Turbo model common probs include synchro probs felt by notciness on the tranny shifts from abuse (strengthened in 1993+), and the exhaust manifold can warp and leak if the bolts aren't checked regularily.  But owning the non-turbo it doesn't have any problems, just be sure to have a Toyota mechanic check it out.

Buy this if you're single! It gets lots of chicks and if you're married this car is not practical as an only car.  I not only use this car as my daily driver but race competitvley in SCCA racing monthly.<br><br>
