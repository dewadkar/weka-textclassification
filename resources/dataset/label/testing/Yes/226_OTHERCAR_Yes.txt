            This is only my second digital camera. The first was an older Olympus. I sold a Canon 70-200 f2.8L lens to finance this thing.

Design Things I Hate:
1. The grip does not fit my hand well. (Male, med. to large size hands.)
2. Flimsy rubber door covering the charging and USB connections. It's hinged by a single piece of plastic. I usually have a way with machinery, i.e. I can make it last a long time. Not so sure about this piece.
3. Tripod socket is not below the lens, rather it's off on one side.
4. No way to put a audio clip on a shot as on the Olympus 3030.
5. Macro mode doesn't get in super-tight as on the Nikon 990.

Design Things I Like:
1. THREE WORDS: ARTICULATED LCD SCREEN!!  The LCD screen pulls away from the camera body and pivots. Get low angle shots without lying on the wet ground!
2. Hotshoe capable of using E-TTL Canon flash units, including those that swivel and tilt, for bounce flash.
3. Ability to afix an adapter (LensMate, aftermarket) that shields the zoom mechanism and allows 49mm filters to be used in front of the lens. Can stay on camera permanently.
4. Controls are easy to operate. No sub-micro buttons that require a chiseled fingernail to operate.
5. LONG battery life with the included Lithium ion battery and charger. My sister has a Nikon 950 and there is no comparison. I've read that this particular battery (in the G1) was originally designed for devices that pull much more current than the G1 does.
6. Relatively fast shot recovery as the camera writes the image to memory.
7. Shooting modes, including B&amp;W and a preset focus mode..good for parties or situations that are unpredictable and you still need a good chance of getting the shot. There's also a panorama mode. Take 8 or ten shots of a landscape, and let the stitching software on your computer paste them all together.
8. Ability to use CompactFlash Type 1 AND Type 2 cards. For some reason, I still don't have the desire to pop a hard disk into the side of my G1.

Performance Notes:
1. Not too much red eye!  The built-in flash is not that far from the lens, but red-eye isn't horrific.
2. Lens seems sharp and contrasty.
3. Low noise overall, with the added benefit of an ASA 50 setting.

I love the results thus far. Less than 200 images might not be enough for a long-term opinion, but it's enough to see that Canon has a winner in the G1.
