            I bought my Prelude SI used 5 years ago.  At the time, I had two friends who had them, and I loved the clean lines and the well thought-out interior.  My favorite aspect of the car is the way I feel when I'm sitting in it.  The dashboard is low and unobtrusive.  The gauges are clear and easy to read.  The controls are well placed.  With many cars, I feel like I'm wrapped in them (Toyota Celica comes to mind)- the Prelude is different that way.  It's like the difference between sitting on the floor of a canoe and trying to paddle or sitting on those seats that go across the gunwales, know what I mean?

The engineering is outstanding.  Steering is crisp (most everyone who's driven it has commented on its excellent road feel).  Honda uses a variable power steering, where you get a lot of boost when you're trying to park but almost no boost at speed.  It's great!  I have never felt like the car is going to get out of control on me; it feels very balanced.

The car does not rust out like Honda's of old.  Here in Chicago they use lots of salt on the streets this time of year, and Preludes seem to take it better than other cars.  I rarely drive mine in winter but I probably wash it more than in the summer, so I can't say too much about that :).
But I notice other Preludes and they seem to handle the stress quite well.

One reason I bought this Prelude is, for a sport coupe it actually has a (barely) usable back seat.  The mid-90's Preludes (from 92 to- what was it, last year?) have a horrible back seat.  Good luck trying to squeeze anything in there.  But mine is usable.  And, like I said, the gauges are cool.  The 90's Preludes had an ugly (to me) techno-look.  I like dial gauges in my car.

Other niceties: a huge trunk (I can get two congas, a throne, bongos, and assorted hand instruments in there :), warms up quick in the winter, good A/C, moonroof, decent stereo, big glovebox, fog lamps.  In short, it has been everthing I wanted in a car.

Negatives: Not as much power as today's sport coupes, brakes are fair at best (Preludes of this vintage are notorious for that), dashboard reflects up on the windshield on a dark road (what a weird design flaw, uh?).  Ok it's not *perfect*, but I love it anyhow.
