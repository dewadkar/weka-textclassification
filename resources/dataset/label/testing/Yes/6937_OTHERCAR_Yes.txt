            I wouldn't even have been interested in getting a truck if the rental company hadn't screwed up. They didn't have my micro-subcompact-econocar, and were forced to give me a Chevy Suburban for the same price. 

I don't like the idea of trucks- I like sports cars. I don't like the idea of taking part in a buying trend that is very popular- I like being an individual. But that weekend I had more fun driving than I have since I first bought my own car.

So when it came time to escape from my own ride (and, after my second sports car, I can only say that no matter what the sticker price, owning a performance machine is an expensive proposition), I went looking at trucks.

GM trucks, namely. I had that stupid GM credit card and felt I'd be shorting myself if I didn't use the points to buy a new car. When I have more time, I'll write a scathing epinion about that little &quot;good deal.&quot;

I've never purchased a new car, but I figured it was time to get myself a good warranty- I never wanted to again be in the position of taking care of problems I didn't cause. 

I went to a one-price lot, which I recommend highly. I found a '99 Blazer, without many amenities, for a very reasonable price. I got a great interest rate, and a reasonably inexpensive long-term warranty. 

I've had the truck for ten months, and have not yet noticed any manufacturing defects. It rides very well- not like a car, of course, but handles easily for its size. I've driven it in cities, in rural areas, and across the United States. I'm extremely happy with the road hazard protection GM offers, and the low maintenance costs. I had to change a tire after I picked up a nail; the truck handled well even at high speed on the freeway with only three legs, and changing it was an easy task. Replacement cost, compared to an equitable wheel on a sports car, were very cheap.

I like my truck; it's a pleasure to drive, I feel extremely safe, and I can dominate the road and other drivers (yeah, it's a real plus in traffic). The bells and whistles, including plenty of extra storage spaces and comfortable interior, really show the customer-oriented engineering.

There are a couple things I don't like: the tires they sell on the truck are garbage, and I highly recommend changing them soon after purchase if you drive in snow or rain. The tailgate window release button in the cab of the truck is useless, because as soon as you close the door, the window latches again.

But that's about it.

Mileage is great- as good or better than a sedan, and my insurance actually dropped, even though the vehicle was worth a full 50% more than my trade-in.

People can eschew American-made automobiles all they want- my Chevy truck makes me quite happy.
