            I recently finished up graduate school, moved to Southern California, and bought some horses.  My old car wasn't up to the task of carrying a bale of hay, let alone pull two very heavy horses and their trailer.  So, I began the tiring search of looking for a truck.

I checked everywhere on the internet, read every review I could find, checked every magazine, went through every dealership in Southern California (that is a lot of them - two weeks, 5-6 dealerships a day).  I did everything I could.  It was my first new car purchase, and I wanted the best I could get.

My search led me to the Dodge 2500 Turbo-Diesel.  This truck is the 3/4 ton so it is considerably heftier than the typical 1/2's you see running around.  In terms of weight, it is comparable to the Ford F250 and the Chevy 2500, although the Dodge is still the heaviest out of them all.  I chose a 4x4 Quad Cab because I enjoy offroading, although I have not dared take my new truck up the side of a mountain.....yet!  The Quad Cab gives significant extra internal room to store things that you don't want to leave in the truck bed.  Sitting in the back is a bit cramped for me (I am 6' 4" tall) unless I take up the whole seat sitting diagonally.  For small children, it would be fine.  Climbing into the truck is fine for me, and I enjoy being higher than nearly every other vehicle on the road.  My mother, who is 5' 5" has a little trouble scrambling into the passenger side, but she prefers my truck to my father's Tahoe any day.

The 2500 Turbo Diesel has a towing capacity of 13,400 lbs - easily more than enough for towing horses.  The acceleration is slow - 0-60 takes about 16 seconds.  The higher end acceleration is a whole lot better.  On the freeway I can easily accelerate to pass people at any speed.  On a side note, there are conversion kits you can get that double the horsepower, increase the torque by 80%, increase mileage by 10%, increase engine life, and do not void factory warranties - I am looking into one of these now.

The truck handles surprisingly well - I often pass cars on corners.  I live down 8 miles of winding mountain roads, and I can stay above the speed limit (up or down hill) without a problem at all.  The diesels come from the factory very tight and it takes about 20,000 miles before they really start breaking in.  Therefore, the initial mileage is somewhat poorer than the mileage after you have driven for 50,000 miles.  On my normal commute, if I have my normal 8 miles of mountain roads, hit cruise control at 70 on the highway for an hour, and have 10 minutes of city driving to get to work, I average about 19.6 mpg, and I only have 1300 miles on my engine.  Normal city driving or heavy stop and go traffic on the freeway drops me to about 16.5 mpg.  This still beats the other trucks by a long shot.  On top of that, a gas engine you have to change the oil and filter every 3,000 miles, but in the diesel it is every 6,000 miles.  Gas engines are expected to last 100,000 - 200,000 miles, but a diesel lasts 800,000 to 1,000,000.  Do the math and you will see that the Dodge Diesel is quite the truck!

The only problem I have with the truck is driving on roads that are made from slab pavement.  You know the kind - every 10 or 20 feet there is a joint.  The truck resonates at freeway speeds and seems to bounce all over the place because the suspension is so tough.  It is not really that much of a deal, but I had to think of something from both sides of the fence!

All in all, I love my 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 Turbo-Diesel Quad Cab 4x4 in black.  It is an awesome truck, and turns heads wherever I go.
