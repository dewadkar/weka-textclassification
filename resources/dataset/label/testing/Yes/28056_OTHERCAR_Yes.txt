            My girlfriend finally replaced her aged 1991 Mercury Tracer and purchased a new 2001 base-model Chevrolet Impala. She had been in love with the Impala after first seeing one at the Philadelphia Auto Show over a year ago. We test-drove a loaded 2000 Impala LS last May and we both were really impressed. I currently drive a 1994 Cadillac Deville and if I closed my eyes, I swear I'd have been driving my Caddy while behind the wheel of the new Impala LS with its silky-smooth ride.  

She may have purchased the Impala sooner, but her financial situation forbade it at the time. Her financial situation improved as she saved for a significant down payment and we returned to the Chevrolet dealer this past weekend. 

Our experience with the dealership had a lot to do with her decision to buy the Impala. A few months earlier, we looked at a Toyota Camry LE, but the sales personnel were very aggressive and were even calling my girlfriend at work when she specifically asked them not to. The Chevrolet salesman was more laid-back and accommodating. At no time did she feel pressured. He took a significant amount of time explaining the difference between a lease and a purchase and it appeared to her advantage to purchase the car over leasing it. She really would've liked to have purchased the Impala LS, but the monthly payments were still too much for her. We thought about the Malibu, but it seemed like a 50/50 chance. I've heard an equal amount of good things and bad things about the Malibu, but nothing but praise for the Impala. That lead us to the base model Impala. 

The base model Impala comes with a SEFI 3.4 litre 180 horsepower V-6 @ 215 torque mated to a four-speed automatic with overdrive. This engine provides more than enough power to propel the Impala to highway speeds, although I prefer the smoother flow of the 200 hp 3.8 litre plant. However, my girlfriend could tell no difference and high-performance is hardly as much a priority with her as fuel economy. Fuel economy, by the way, is a very impressive 21 City and 32 Highway. Unlike my Caddy, the Impala is happy with regular fuel.  The base Impala also has a very smooth ride, but I noticed a little lag in acceleration compared to the LS. I felt very little of the torque-steer effect common to cars with transversely mounted FWD powertrains. The base Impala had very short stopping distances even without anti-lock brakes. Without anti-lock brakes? Yes, I thought it was a given that ALL new cars had anti-lock brakes, however, they are optional on  the base-model Impala, but standard on the LS. Deleting the anti-lock brake option will save one about $600, but I don't think it would be prudent to forgo this safety feature. 

The base-model Impala isn't quite as nice as the sporty LS, but it is hardly taxi-plain either. The base Impala has power windows and locks and a standard AM/FM stereo cassette that gives great sound and has more features than the one in my '94 Cadillac. There is also a remote trunk release located near the hood release and a tilt steering wheel. Trunk space, by the way, is cavernous with a low liftover. The heating and A/C are more than up to par. Power seats, however, are optional. I feel the base cloth upholstery is actually more attractive than the upgraded cloth material that looks as if a child drew on it with crayons. Unfortunately the plastic trim seems a little cheap and the grays and flat blacks are a bit too somber for my tastes. Fortunately there is a small amount of imitation wood to break up the monotony. I would suggest one order the "Neutral" (beige) interior. It looks a lot classier and not as funereal as the gray. 

The gearshift lever was column-mounted which my girlfriend found odd since all of her previous cars had a floor-mounted gearshift. As for me, all of my cars have had the column-mounted gearshift I prefer. I guess that's just a matter of taste. Unfortunately, the base Impala has no console, but this allows plenty of room for six passengers, whereas the Impala LS with its console and floor-mounted shift allows for only five.  Both the base Impala and LS offer plenty of room for rear-seat passengers. The base Impala has a fold down center armrest with molded cupholders and cubby-holes, but there is no cover which I felt must've been a foolish cost-cutting move on behalf of GM's bean-counters. Inside the ashtray are two ports: one for the cigarette ligher and another for accessories such as a cell phone or laptop

Of course, there are some things you don't get with the base Impala. There is no trunk pass-through for long-thin cargo and you have manually adjustable seats with a rather clumsy lever under the cushion. Lighted vanity mirrors are also absent. The 3.4 litre's engine bay also isn't as attractive or well laid-out as in the 3.8 plant. You also don't get a remote to lock and unlock the doors or arm the optional security system. You get both driver's and passenger's side airbags, but side airbags are only available as an option on the LS.  The LS also has an automatic dimming inside rearview mirror whereas the base Impala has a manual unit. The base Impala also doesn't have GM's On-Star satellite locating system available with the LS. Of course if you never had these things like my girlfriend with her old Tracer, you would never miss them.

The worst aspect of the base Impala are the 16" plain steel wheels with their tacky bolt-on plastic wheelcovers. I would seriously consider getting a nice set of aftermarket wheels or ordering the upmarket 16" cast aluminum wheels. The sport wheels are only available on the LS. The LS also has a rear spoiler which I find silly on a car like the Impala. The Impala, whether base or LS looks a lot more dignified without the spoiler and less like some kid's slammed Accord. 

The best thing about the base-model Impala is the price. It is a hell of a lot of car for a little bit of money. It shares the same chassis as the more prestigious Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Regal but is closer in size to the Pontiac Bonneville and Buick LeSabre. My girlfriend's Dark Jade Green Metallic car with Neutral Interior and anti-lock brakes went out the door for a mere $19,800. You can push that figure above $25,000 for a loaded Impala LS.  At that point, I would consider a much-larger Mercury Grand Marquis with a V-8 and RWD. The Impala's warranty is only 3 years / 36,000 miles. That doesn't seem like much when Kia and Hyundai hype 10 year / 100,000 mile warranties, but the Impala is a superior car. Hell, I have a cheap watch with a lifetime warranty, but that doesn't make it as good as a Rolex. GMAC offered financing at 8%, but my girlfriend got a much better rate from her company's credit union, so it pays to shop around. 

All and all the base model Impala is an impressive car for less than $20K, but I'd spend the extra $900 for the 3.8 litre V-6.
