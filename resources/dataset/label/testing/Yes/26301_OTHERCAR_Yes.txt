            I have a friend who owns a 2000 Honda Civic and so far, the car has not given her any mechanical problems.  Well, first of all, she bought the car brand new last year, but the only thing wrong about the car and I learned that people who also owns a 2000 Civic have been experiencing the very same problem.  With the 5-speed manual transmission, when you want to shift into reverse, you have to go forward abit before you can finally get the gear into reverse.  I think that is sooo ridiculous to have to do this, but it is known as a manufacture defect when they built the manual transmission.  

I almost went out and bought this car, but I'm glad that my friend brought this to my attention about her car.  I think the Civics are cute little cars, but what is not so cute is the transmission that has that defect.  My mom also owned a Honda Civic 2-door, but hers was a '93 and was an automatic transmission.  She has experienced some problems, but it wasn't mechanical.  It was involving her horn that never worked, a air-conditioner that did not work either, and a CD player that was broken.  Her car has sure seen alot of bad luck in it's seven years, but she bought this car used and so, she only had it four years until one day, she was struck by some driver who didn't even pay one bit of attention to her driving which resulted in my mother's Honda being totaled.  

Honda Civic has been known for many years as being the best Japanese car built and is suppose to be trouble-free, but if you are planning to buy your Honda used, there is a website that gives you detailed information about the car you want to inquire about.  It will tell you whether the car has been in a previous accident or not.  I have no clue as to what the website address is, but I will return later to update this review and by that time, I will have the website address.  

PS. I now have the website address on where you can find out about a car you are about to purchase.  The website address is: www.carfax.com   Good luck!
