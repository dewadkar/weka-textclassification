            CRV brought the SUV to the average person.  It was one of the first affordable SUV's and one of the best.  The CRV is a great value with lots of room for the family and cargo.  The seats fold down with ease once you have done it a couple of times.  The power outlet and picnic tables in the back are nice bonuses.  We have put 60,000 miles in 3 years and have generally been pleased with the CRV's performance.  We have had a number of little problems; more than we would expect from a HONDA, but nothing major.  The biggest complaint I hear about this vehicle is that the seat blocks the view when the driver looks over his/her right shoulder.  We also feel the CRV lacks a bit of get up and go, but it is more than adequate.  It is to be expected because this large SUV is based on the little Honda Civic.  To sum it all up, this vehicle is a great value, but not perfect.  You will have fun with this SUV.<br><br>
