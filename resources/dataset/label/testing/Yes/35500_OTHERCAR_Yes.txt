            We bought our Odyssey a month ago and it is a wonderful car. It has so many features that other minivans do not have.  Most importantly, the third row bench fits neatly into the floor and never needs to be removed.  This well is great for holding your groceries or other bage still without having them fall over.  The only bad part of this well is that if you lean over the back seat to get something in the back ,your arms are not long enough.The dual sliding power doors are incredible when carrying babies or groceries.  But, the doors soemtimes have a mind of their own and have on occasion not closed all the way, or not wanted to close at all.  The remote has a button to automatically close or open these sliding doors and a couple of times they have decided not to work.  One other annoying but safe feature is that these sliding doors will not open unless the car is in park.  If I want to drop someone off, I need to actually put the car in park before they can open this back door. The V6 engine gives you power on the highways and a very smooth ride. The CD player and speaker system yields a wonderful sound.  There are tons of drink holders throughout the car which are great when you are traveling with children. We love our new odyssey.
