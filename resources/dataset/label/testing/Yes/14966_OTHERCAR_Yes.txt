            The Sony Mavica Cameras are my golden children.

In my work as a teacher trainer, I test out dozens of image-acquisition devices every semester. If it's inexpensive (read- within the budget of most schools), I've used it. 

So when I tell you that the FD-73 and FD-51 are the two best cameras I've used, I'm speaking for hundreds of teachers and hundreds of kids who have tried out these machines under my aegis. I can't say enough good things about them.

I'll attack the few limitations on these machines first, just to get them out of the way:

*The camera can take horrendous pictures, if your hand moves during the click (no big shock here).

*Often, the images tend to be a bit dark. Take note that if you're not a fan of using the flash, you'd better have excellent ambient lighting to make up for it. This problem can get so bad that even Photoshop cannot fix what the flashless artist hath wrought.

Literally, those are the only two issues I've had with these machines. That's it.

I've taken the FD-73 with me to France, Montreal, the beach, a dam, a nature preserve, and a water tower. Every single time, it's proven itself to be the perfect choice.

The Mavicas are small, have nice LED screens, and tell you when your batteries are dying. When they do, you just recharge them with the charger that comes with the camera; you don't have to worry about taking out a home equity loan to pay for AA batteries, as you do with many other cameras in this price range.

To boot, the images, when taken with a good eye and steady hand, can be truly gorgeous. What more could you want?

But the best feature of this camera, and the one that keeps me (and every single teacher I've taught in the past two years) coming back to the Mavica is its storage medium-- the ubiquitous floppy. 

You probably already knew this, but these machines can store 35 or more images on a regular old, $0.15  floppy disk. Not only can they do this, but the images are stored in WWW-ready JPEG format, and not some proprietary compression scheme that you'll have to struggle to convert to something useful. 

Most images are between 10K-50K in size, in their raw form, and can be compressed further. 

Best of all, you can just pop out the diskette and pop it into _any_ machine with a 3.5&quot; floppy drive. Yep, Win95, 98, 3.1, and MacOS included!
(Note that iMacs don't come with floppy drives...)

This is the ideal camera to take on a vacation with you; you'll spend time taking pictures, not uploading them. Plus, when the camera is full, you won't have to head back to the hotel to void its memory to allow for more picture-taking. All you'll need to do is swap the floppy for an empty one. You can fit five floppies into a shirt pocket, which is enough space to store 175 images from the Mavica. Impressive.

For teaching, this is also an excellent digital camera. Albeit a bit costly for most individual teachers, no school should be without one of these machines. They're perfect for impromptu photography, and their product can be shared within seconds, with no uploading. If I were creating a school newspaper or website, I'd buy at least one of these machines.
