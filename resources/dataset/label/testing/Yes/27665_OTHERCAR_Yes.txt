            This is my second digital camera and it addresses the two biggest shortcomings with my first camera, a Kodac DC50. The MVC-CD1000 takes higher resolution images and has automatic archive storage of the large image files with the onboard three inch CD.

The Sony MVC CD-1000 creates larger files than the DC50, but they also contain more resolution, enough resolution to get a photo quality 8x10 print. The storage media is an onboard three inch CD, so the files are automatically archived at full resolution. I don't have to store them on my hard drive, transfer them to a CD or work with an unmanageable pile of floppy disks.

When taking pictures I am not concerned about how many pictures I can take. I just shoot. I have yet to run the battery down and took over 60, 800k photos at one family gathering.

My wife sells real estate, and takes a lot of pictures, that off-set cost paid for the original camera in less than a year. It will take two years to pay for this camera but we are getting a lot more value. We have five grand daughters to take pictures of, that was consuming my hard drive. Also, I was getting some priceless photos but was unable to get photo quality prints from the low resolution DC50 files. With the MVC CD-1000 I am getting better images and I can get prints as well.

The package we bought came with computer software for editing images, software for managing image files, and software for transferring files from CDs to a hard drive. The software for the Windows platform is more functional than the software for the Macintosh platform but it came with both. To get predictable results when printing photos you will need to learn how to size your images for the size of the print. If you have never done this before expect a learning curve.

Completed CDs are viewable on both Macintosh and Windows computers and we use both.

I find that I get more "keeper" photos because I am able to edit the images after taking the pictures. I crop and adjust the brightness, sometimes even the color balance.

As for difficulty of operation: One of my favorite photos was taken by my 6 year old grand daughter using the default settings for the camera and the flash adjusted to the lowest setting.

The MVC CD-1000 is a 2 megapixel camera. I think this is the most important feature to look for. Two megapixel images create large files. That makes the onboard three inch CD storage media indispensable. You can choose to store an uncompressed TIFF file that is nine megabits. I use the 1600X12000 jpg file format. It will put about 150 images on one CD. I have not used any of the lower resolution formats and don't feel the need to do so.

If price is a big factor in your choice of camera go for a 2 megapixel camera first. Look for a storage media solution and other features later. You can buy a read/write CD-ROM drive after your hard drive gets full.

For us this camera meets the two most important features to look for in a digital camera: Image resolution and storage.

If you would like to look at some of my first photos go look at the Sony ImageStation web site: (free unlimited storage and quality printing of images through Ofoto at competative prices.)
