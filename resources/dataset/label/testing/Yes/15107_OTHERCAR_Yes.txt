            The 1999 Nissan Altima is great. The car is very roomy from the back, and it has an exceptionally smooth ride based upon it's compact import competitors. I love the cd player, the sound system in the car is really appealing. There are some features that I dislike about this car however. The trunk is roomy, yet it has a very odd shape making the car look akward. Also, I have the GXE model, it doesn't have power seats which is an inconvience, being 5'1, I need a car with adjustable seats becuase I'm not going to spend 5 grand more to get a Maxima! The car is very quiet, it hardly makes a sound and it's perfect being the 23 year old that I am. I think this car would be great for the teen that's on the go, or the college student looking for a durable car with great gas mileage. It's also front wheel drive, therefore giving it great handling in wet weather. But an altima!<br><br>
