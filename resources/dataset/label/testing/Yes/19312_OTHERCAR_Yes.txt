            I own a FinePix1400.It's a great little camera and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a very simple, idiot-proof, relatively inexpensive point and shoot.
I got it at Wal*Mart for just over $145 after tax. In the box was the camera, 4AA alkaline batteries,  the usb cable for downloading pictures to your computer, 4 MB SmartMedia card  that holds 23 images at default resolution, a big instruction manual and registration/warranty info. If you're going to buy a digital camera, you should invest in 2 sets of rechargeable NiMH AAs (not NiCad) and a good charger. I have 2 sets of NexTel NiMHs and a MAHA charger. Battery life with the NiMHs is about 200 pictures, including extensive goofing off with the LCD on. All my pictures are taken with the LCD.
The camera is very quick to turn on, and the LCD is quick too.  The LCD is fun to use  and once you get used to seeing the results of your pictures you'll never use the viewfinder again.  You can adjust the brightness of the LCD in the menus.There are tons of manual settings to play with yet every option has an &#147auto&#148 setting that takes great photos on it&#146s own.
It is very easy to install the USB connection. Images transfer very quickly. The main reason I selected this over the Olympus 360 was the USB connection.
The buttons and menus are very intuitive and all you should need is a quick skim through of the user&#146s manual to familiarize yourself with the functions.
The software included with the camera is good for very basic photo editing. If you want to do more advanced editing, you would probably want to obtain a higher-end photo editor.
 The colors the Finepix produced were exact. The picture was sharp and clear, definitely a keeper. I see no difference in picture quality between this and a traditional automatic film camera *at reasonable sizes (noticeable difference in 8x10s).
There are some far better cameras out on the market, but the FinePix 1400 serves my needs at this time and I am very satisfied. I didn't want to spend a fortune, nor did I want bargain basement quality. I'm not a computer guru and still don't know a lot of terms, but if someone wants quality and a good name then this is the camera to consider.
