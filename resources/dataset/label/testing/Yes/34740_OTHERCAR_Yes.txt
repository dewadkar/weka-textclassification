            We bought our 1997 VW Passat GLX with the V6 new.  It was a steal for around $24,000.  We got the loaded version with leather seats, moon roof, CD changer in trunk, etc.  To date is has only about 30,000 miles on it but it has held up to two kids and me (who is very hard on a clutch) remarkably well.  The car handles like a true German vehicle, very remiscent of a more expensive Mercedes.  You can really feel the road.  I can't speak for the automatic version, but the manual shift really lets you feel in control.  It has great pickup and acceleration, brakes nicely and really hugs the curves.  It is just plain fun to drive!!  

The only problems that we have had with it are electrical and they were pretty minor things - I believe it was a loose plug or something.  The paint is wearing well, no fading or spotting.  No leaks from the moon roof, although there is some noticeable wind noise.  The CD changer in the trunk is pretty annoying, it takes up too much trunk space and you can't get really big items in it.  However, a part of the back seat folds down so you can compensate by fitting longer objects in there.  

It came with a tether anchor in the rear for the carseat (hurray!) and it was very easy to install 2 car seats into.  Most of the controls like the lights and windshield wipers are very easy to locate.  I guess the most annoying thing about it is no glove box.  I can live with that.  We will be keeping this car till the wheels fall off.<br><br>
