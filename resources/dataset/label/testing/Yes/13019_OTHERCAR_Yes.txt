            I've owned my 2000 T-6 since December of 1999 and it has been a very enlightening experience. I am a little concerned this car has spoiled me to the point I will always need to buy more expensive cars even though previously I had always been quick to talk down the benefits of owning more expensive cars. The S80 has changed that forever.

The S80 is a sure footed and quiet sedan with good road feel. It goes where you point it and lacks the annoying body "wiggle waggle" of other large cars when the road gets twisty but lacks the audible and tactile feedback of an all out sports sedan. 

The climate control is well designed and brings a lot of clean, filtered air into the cabin which keeps it feeling fresh and looking clean. The climate control is fully automatic but individual features can be easily over-ridden simply by turning the fan speed knob or pushing one or more of the three buttons that routes the air. The fan is quite powerful and I sometimes turn it to a lower level than the one that is selected automatically as the sheer volume of air can create a loud rush which is annoying since the car is so quiet otherwise. At normal fan speeds the system is nearly silent. The good thing is the settings are retained so I do not need to constantly over-ride the system and yet there is a powerful fan if needed for defrosting. There are also air vents for the back seat passengers in the columns between the doors. This is the best climate control of any car I am aware of.

The fuel economy was a pleasant surprise and coupled with the 21 gallon tank the range is impressive. I average 27mpg on the freeway cruising at 70 MPH. Faster than that and the mileage starts to fall off but perhaps not as fast as you might expect due to the cars excellent aerodynamics. The body of the S80 has it's roots in a sporty concept car under development by Volvo since around 1990. Extensive wind tunnel testing was done to refine the cars shape for low drag and good handling at speed. In the early 90's Volvo displayed a non-functional prototype at an autoshow. Afterwards, the Honda Prelude with the look-alike rear-end was released raising my suspicion that Honda copied Volvo, not vice-versa. The city fuel mileage is less impressive at around 21 MPG but still quite good for a large car with so much acceleration.

The reliability of this car has been outstanding, relieving me of concerns brought on by some early reports that the car had troubles. There was one defective component in the dash control panel that was replaced during a normal service visit and the weather stripping on one door had come un-glued over a six inch section. That was also fixed free of charge. I think those with troubles are often the most vocal. Some have also claimed the front brake pads are not very durable but during the last service I was informed there was 40% left so I expect they will last until the 37K service. All in all, I am very impressed with the trouble-free nature of this car, more so considering all the technology that it is loaded with. 

I had the dealer turn off the daytime running lights and had the locks programmed to open all doors with the first click of the remote since I often have at least one other passenger. Now the headlight switch works just like other cars I am familiar with. 

I purchased the stability and traction control option for my wife who is not an experienced driver in the snow but I was skeptical whether I would use it since I am a skier with a lot of snow experience. I have found the system to be valuable as it can perform manuevers that are impossible to perform without four brake pedals and razor fast reflexes. The system uses a small device that measures sideways g-forces and compares that value to the value expected by computations using the speed of the car and the angle of the front wheels. If it determines a slide is beginning it instantly applies the brake to the appropriate wheel(s) to bring the car back on track. The system works very quickly and inconspicuously so there is a triangular warning light on the dash to warn that the road may be have less traction than is apparent.

There is no doubt that this car costs a lot more than other sedans and many probably wonder where that money goes. It seems Volvo has tried to improve on many less visible aspects of other cars and put the money into areas that may not be visible such as a rigid chassis with unequaled rust protection, excellent brakes and the many electric components. Other manufacturers cheapen up areas that are not visible and it ends up costing money down the road. 

Others have commented sufficiently on other aspects of the vehicle so I will end this review with some brief impressions:

Stereo upgrade: fantastic sound!
Seats: very comfortable but not as good as some previous Volvos. Electric functions work very well and are intuitive to use.
Cupholders: Not enough room for a mug of coffee.
rear-view mirror: auto-dim works nicely
side-view mirrors: not quite large enough, electric controls work very well.
Fold-down split rear seats: nicely done
Windshield wipers: Easy to use delay, very quiet but could use one faster speed for torrential downpours.
rear visibility: below average due to large, high trunk.
Fit and finish: excellent, quality look and feel
