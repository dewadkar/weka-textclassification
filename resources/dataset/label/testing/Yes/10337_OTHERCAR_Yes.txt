            The 258,971 nearly trouble free miles spent 'living' in our '96 Corolla sent us this past January straight to the 2001 Corolla LE now parked in our garage.

My husband's work as a building inspector causes us to spend many hours and travel many miles in our Corolla.  The '96 with it's record of no major work of any kind; plugs were changed, tires wore out, we got a new battery, and put a heck of a lot of miles on the little beast, taught us a powerful lesson regarding which car to consider when we shopped for a new car this past January.

Our 2001 LE comes equipped with the 'safe' type air bag on the passenger side.  This is an important consideration for us... I am in the group of 'small' passengers who are most at risk from the old type air bags.  More than one near miss on the roadway in the '96 has caused me to wonder if I were going to become a statistic.  I no longer eye the airbag with total distrust.  My husband has nothing but praise for the handling and maneuverability of the Corolla when another car whizzes alongside and suddenly cuts in front of us.  Sad to say for those of us who spend 30,000 or more miles on the road each year this 'road rudeness' is a fact of life we all endure.

My football tackle husband has more than enough leg room behind the wheel.  He praises the Corolla's handling, peppy little engine, and smooth ride on each and every trip we take... and we just got back from another almost 2,000 mile travel week.  The car purred along like a quiet little tiger.

While the car is listed as a compact we have found the trunk space to accommodate with no problem: 2 wheeled suitcases, 1 over stuffed 'army style' duffle bag, two filled garment bags and all the other assorted bags and containers a woman who will be living out of the trunk for a week can find to stuff into it.

The back seat has little or no leg room for larger folks, I sit there when hubby drives and grown son is visiting.  They both have ample leg room up front, as do I sitting in the back.  The seat belts in the Corolla are a tad uncomfortable for a smallish woman, they fit a large man just fine.

The Corolla with it's 36 - 38 MPG is thrifty on the road.

We are sold on Toyota in general and Corolla in particular.
