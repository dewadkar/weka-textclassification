            The Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia.  It's a special vehicle that fills a certain niche in the market.  The only niche!  When I wanted one, the search started on one of amazement.  I couldn't believe the prices I was seeing!  I ended up with a 16 year old vehicle, with 204,000 miles on it, plus some minor body damage for five grand.  That sounds like I got a bum deal.  But considering the research I put into it, I paid a low to average price.  I've owned it for two years now.  I've put about 15,000 miles on it.  I've also performed a partial engine rebuild and about $3000 ore into it.  This sound horrible, and while I agree that it is not good, I must add that this is not your average automobile!

There is a major web site available to help that got me through the bad times with this vehicle.  Without it, I would have been sunk.  I learned a lot about repairing and most of the repairs were simple.  But, my career and its nature were vanagon-friendly.  I committed, busy lifestyle will not match with a vanagon, unless you have a good mechanic and know how to pay them!

I'm a park ranger, so I live out of the vanagon in the summertime.  Camping in the westy is about as good as it gets for a vehicle that can parallel park with the best of 'em (it has great steering).  Stove, fridge (AC/DC/propane), sink, two beds and two dining tables.  It could be very crowded for four people, but it will sleep and feed four full sized folk!  I could go on, but here's what a potential vanagon buyer should know:

1. The head gaskets last only about 80,000 miles.  Replacement costs about 600-1000 bucks in the shop, though you can do it yourself if mechanically inclined and have the room to deal.  If the vanagon doesn't have a recent head job, then knock off $1000 or more.

2. Seam rust.  If you can discern seam rust or bubbles, then knock off $3000 or pass on the purchase unless it is a deal and you can live with the looks.

3. Westy vans should be checked over to prove a working refrigerator and sink.  Check the propane tank for rust.  If there is rust, you'll have to replace it to have it filled, so count on $350.  

I think the van is the ultimate weekend warrior transportation and shelter, but it gets 14-18 mpg.  It's 80hp with 5000 pounds to push.  Uphill travel in the mountains speeds at about 45 mph max.  

A great 84 vanagon westy in top shape and new gaskets ( no more than 20,000mi.) Should fetch $7000.  An 84 passenger van should fetch about $2500. The passenger van isn't worth effort of upkeep. 

A 1991 synchro westy in top shape seems to be going for twenty grand. I don't understand who is going to buy an 11-year-old van for such a price, but the newer the van, the better the perks.  I wish I held out for at least a 1986 - 91 hp powered van.  Try to choose an auto transmission if you live in the flats, they last longer.  If you live in the hills, go with a manual tranny.  My AT works okay in the mountains, but I think the mileage and the engine suffer for it.

I would suggest this for the "right" people as the ultimate camping, outdoor gear vehicle.
