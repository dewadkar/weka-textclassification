            Disclaimer #1: with such achievements, any kind of criticism against this car should be considered as extreme pickiness
Disclaimer #2: I am a Ferrari-lover and owner, puts things in perspective.

I'll start with the biggest and most subjective drawback I see in this car: esthetics. The rear spoiler, the side air ducts, the front spoiler openings, all these add-ons spoil the purity of the 996 styling, which itself turned many people off with controversial headlights looks. The car looks impressive, but it definitively lacks purity.

Inside, no surprise, modern age 996 layout and finish, good quality material and finish, attention to details, nothing to frown about for a car with such a price tag.

The first contact with the beast is fairly reassuring. Relatively easy to drive, clutch and gearbox are smooth and precise, not as intimidating as a 550 Maranello is in the first dozen miles.

On the highway, the immense torque reserve provides stunning performance to get out of trafic in a very relaxed way, while the brakes, simply perfect, are always there when needed. There is no overly noticeable turbo lag, and the huge torque available at all revs makes up for it anyway.

On bumpy roads, ride comfort remains acceptable, firm but not harsh, no squeaks from the interior trim, but the car has a significant tendancy to 'follow' road irregularities, especially while braking, and requires swift attention to prevent sidewards moves which could become problematic. Not unexpected with tires that wide, but a 355 or a 550 handle slightly better in this area.

In 'committed' driving, the 996 biturbo displays huge potential. The package is simply close to perfect. Power anytime, anywhere, in any gear, nothing gets into the way of the experience. Furthermore, the all wheel drive traction makes it a very forgiving car: you can floor it at low to middle speed corner exists where a 355 would send you sideways and a Maranello traction control get into your way, showing that brutal oversteer is just an inch away.

These traction capabilities have two edges:
- they make it a realistic every day, all-weather car
- they draw a clear boundary between pleasure and efficiency
Oversteer is part of the fun of powerfull cars, and here mere mortals have to choose between the safety provided by all-wheel-drive, and the fun it prevents. 

To close the handling part, I have not dared testing the behaviour at break lift-off, but it's bound to be worse than a mid-engined car, thus snappy.

Not to be overlooked, engine noise is nice, but not as gorgeous as italian equivalents. An important parameter in the pleasure equation.

Running costs are in line with the potential of the car. Tire/brakes/fuel budget are very, very significant. This kind of defeats the purpose of the car which is to be a realistic every day supercar.
Worse, Porsche official dealer servicing costs are very significant, a yearly service will fetch twice that of a Ferrari V8 car, the every-four-years cam belt changes excepted.
