            Although initially I was looking for a newer Z3, one drive in the '98 M roadster convinced me that it is everything that the Z3 was meant to be.  These two cars are vastly different; virtually the only common component shared between the M and the garden variety is the 5-speed transmission (there wasn't room for the people at M to put in a 6 speed or an automatic).

More specifically, the two cars differ in that the M roadster has stiffer springs, different shocks, sway bars, bigger breaks, totally different engine, even different bearings, etc.  These refinements are all reflected in the way this car drives.

Power
There is a reason "M Power" is engraved on the head of this car.  BMW claims 0-60 acceleration in 5.2 seconds.  From the literature that I have read on this car, I think that this is fairly accurate.  This car surges ahead, whether you are on a flat straight away or a twisty uphill road.  Applying only moderate pressure to the pedal can amaze the driver.  This does take some getting used to.  Nevertheless, once you get the hang of it, you can get very smooth acceleration from the in-line six.

Handling
Although it's been said before, "like it's on rails".  Twisty roads are blast in this car; I have driven it fairly hard through the twisties and have yet to experience a loss of control or any significant slipping of the wheels (like I have in my 1972 BMW 2002).  The springs, shocks, and sway bars work beautifully in this car.  You can "feel" the road and not bust a kidney at the same time.  The steering, like the acceleration, can take some getting used to.  It's steering is very responsive!  It is easy to over steer in this car, so some care should be taken until you get the feel for it.

Braking
Very effective, large anti-lock disc brakes all the way around give me the confidence to use this car's power.  They stop the car fast!

Downsides to the M roadster
There are a couple of negatives to this car, but you have already probably guessed them; they are expected in a car like this.  You can't buy it for the trunk space (only 5.2 cubic feet).  Replacement parts are pricey (it is a sports car).  

Recommendation
After owning this car for 6 months, I am still amazed by the power and handling when I drive it.  I would recommend this car for anyone who is looking for a fun sports car and expects just that.  This is not a good choice for people who want carrying capacity.
