            Well I traded in my Mazda for a cougar...never thought it would happen, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. My 99 silver cougar is AWESOME. The way it handles curves is amazing and the look can't improve anymore. The price for this car was reasonable mine was $14,900. Great for a girl in college and supporting herself, but who still wanted the sporty look. The inside of the car is very modern and unique. It has almost a &quot;futuristic&quot; touch to it. The only thing I don't like about my cougar is I did not add more features to it {sunroof and spoiler}. If you are going to get a cougar, I say go all out and pay a little extra for the rest. The cougar is by far the best car I have had...{sorry Mazda}!!!! If I see you while I'm driving.......VRRRRRRRMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!<br><br>
