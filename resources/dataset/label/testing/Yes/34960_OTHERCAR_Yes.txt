            To start I'll say that this is a review for the GTP trim of the Grand Prix, there are huge differences in the personality and style of the SE, GT, and GTP.

I have a 2 door GTP with every option available for the year.  The color is amazing, midnight blue.  But it was nearly impossible to find this color with all the options and low miles.  Heads up Display is an awesome feature, it's ones of those features that I actually use, along with the heated seat.

When you drive this car you just feel fast, and you can back it up too.  I blow the doors off my brother's V6 Mustang.  A whole lotta torque for you to play with around town.  I know somebody is going to read this review and say "I'd like a Grand Prix, but everybody has one, so I'd be just like everybody else.  What I haven't seen in a review on this car yet is anybody talking about modifications to the car.  Theres a ton of engine, exhaust, interior, and exterior mods.  You can get 20 hp from a $60 pulley for your supercharger!  Just yesterday I installed a new grill, makes my car really stand out.  If you do it your way, you'll have a one of a kind Grand Prix.

What I dont like is that Pontiac cut corners and quality.  While for the most part I love the car and think the interior is great, it has some problems.  On the leather seats theres a fairly large section of cloth material where the bottom connects to the back of the chair, not a big deal but unsightly.  Also I wish there was a way to turn off the information center, sometimes I wish I couldnt watch my average MPG drop like a rock ;)  It's  nice that you can check all that stuff but it makes your mission in life to get the best mileage you can and you forget to have fun driving the car.

In conclusion if you want a sporty and fun car, one that your friends can admire but still remains practical, then a GTP might just be the right car for you.
