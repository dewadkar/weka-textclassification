            I have owned my stodgy utilitarian for three years now and can report that I've had no significant problems. This is a low maintenance SUV that is low key, roomy, rugged and reliable. What I like the most is that its origins don't lie with any other vehicle. It was designed from the beginning to be a sport-utility vehicle cut and dry. In contrast to so many other sport utilities these days, the Montero is trucklike, not carlike. I guess this is the reason why this SUV is so low key. Most drivers need a car feel, not truck feel. The interior is dressed in genuine wood and leather trim ala (Range Rover). This SUV is built in the same vein as a Range Rover off road performance first luxury and amenities second no question. Its highway manners are generally commendable, with low noise levels and a gentle ride. This SUV has a very versatile four wheel drive system called "Active Trac 4WD". The system is designed for any condition imaginable to man & vehicle. The transmission silky smooth with a effortless feel. If there are couple of negatives it is vague steering and the rear outward view which is interfered with by the spare tire. With all that said I would definitely recommend this vehicle new or used.
