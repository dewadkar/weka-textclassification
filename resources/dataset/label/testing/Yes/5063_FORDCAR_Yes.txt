            After comparing the competition, and the little brother Sportrac, We decided on the Supercrew XLT 4x4. While shopping we were surprised to find that the sportrac was only a few hundred dollars less and offered far less 
Use-ability: I was skeptical of how "usable" the Supercrew would be in the real world having owned trucks with full-size beds. Now I have found after 5 months and nearly 10,000 miles that I wouldn't let this vehicle go if I had to.

THE BEAUTY: Good looking truck, lots of compliments. The interior is spacious and comfortable for up to 6, has excellent leg room front and rear, is as quiet at highway speeds, and is comparable to many fine sedans that I have owned. You never get tired driving this thing. Ride is excellent for a truck.
THE BEAST: I wasn't sure about the bed usage being only 5 and a half feet, but Ford did their homework. Most items you would ever need to haul in an urban setting fit nicely, you let the tailgate down and 4x8 sheets of plywood fit perfectly. Towing capacity: This baby is hard pressed to be over worked. Off road: good clearance, and decent front and rear overhang make it very maneuverable.
If you are looking for the best of both worlds, you have found the right vehicle. Add a locking roll top bed cover and you have a short bed pickup or a sedan with a huge trunk!
UPDATE 2/22/03: We have now had the truck for 8 months and 16,000 miles,and the truck has not missed a lick. We have taken it on a 2500 mile trip only to verify the comfort mentioned above. LET IT SNOW!! Recently we were blessed with 18 inches of snow (sic), the 4 wheel drive worked flawlessley, no levers to fight, just a twist of a knob and it silently goes to work.
Each day we become more impressed.
