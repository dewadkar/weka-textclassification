            I have had my red and tan Miata since I bought it new in August 1996.  It has subsequently become one of my most prized &quot;possessions.&quot; I find it hard to call it a possession, since it is so much a part of my life.  I consider driving it with the top down in the California sun or under the starry sky:

 * therapy after a long, hard day,
 * a reward for a job well done,
 * euphoria on four wheels.

As you will probably read in most of the epinions here, the Miata is simply the best roadster you can get for anywhere near the price. Credit Mazda and the tremendous success of the Miata with starting and fueling the roadster craze. Miatas have been doing it right and doing it longer than any other roadster out there right now - even Toyota admits its new MR2 Spyder was designed to compete with the Miata. I wish them luck.

Truly, you cannot possibly believe how much a joy it is to drive a Miata until you get behind the wheel and go for a loooong test drive.  Most dealers, if you catch them when they are not too busy, are pretty laid back about Miata test drives. They, too, know that the car sells itself: once you get behind the wheel, you are hooked.  I had several dealers simply hand me the keys and let me go when I was car shopping. One took me to the gas station, filled it up, had me drop him back at the dealership, pointed the way to the nearest back road, and told me to be back before they closed four hours later!

So, what do I love about my Baby Car?

-- Driving ---
It is MADE for twisty mountain roads - its 50-50 front-back weight distribution, low profile, and excellent suspension make it a joy to take flying around corners at sometimes twice the posted suggested speed.  

The tremendously short shifter throw makes shifting with one finger simple and effortless.  (PLEASE do not make the mistake of buying a Miata with an automatic transmission- it is simply not the same driving experience)

Some have said that the Miata is underpowered, but I disagree. I admit to having a lead foot, and I find that my car rapidly responds to anything I ask of it, but does not let me get in too much trouble.  I have driven some faster, more powerful cars, but I KNOW I would be spending much more time paying tickets than driving those cars.  The power curve peaks between 3500 and 4500 RPM, which is just around freeway speed in 5th, so I can pass cars on the freeway with the greatest of ease.  I may not be the fastest one out of the intersection, but the car will make up for it with maneuverability and responsiveness as we go.  The Miata is not a muscle car by any means, but when you can sail up back mountain roads with responsive steering, an enthusiastic engine, quick, finger-shifts, and the fresh air rushing through your hair (or baseball cap), you will see its magic.

Its great turning radius and tiny size make it a cinch to park, especially in cramped quarters.  

It gets great gas mileage, between 25 and 30 regularly.  


--- Interior ---
Since it is such a small car, all of the controls are close by and easy to reach.  The simplicity of most of the gages makes for an aesthetically pleasing cockpit.

My car came with speakers in the headrests, so that when I drop the top, I flip the fader and can hear my CD's even on the freeway.  Speakers like these are available as an aftermarket item from several stores.

As needed in any well-used roadster, the heater is magnificent. I can drive in the evening chill with the top down, and stay toasty warm with the furnace kindly supplied by Mazda.  

Likewise, while some purists believe air conditioning has no place in a convertible, it is wonderful to have the A/C going while the sun is blazing down on you as you fly on down the roadï¿½.

I actually like the manual top, since I can quickly drop it at a red light or on the side of the road, and I never worry about the mechanisms breaking and stranding me with a half-up top.  Pre-1999 Miatas come with a plastic rear window.  I take good care of my window, and have had no problems with it. I _always_ unzip the window before lowering the top, which prevents a bad crease/crack from forming.

Since purchasing my Miata, my baseball cap collection has grown ten-fold.  I keep several caps behind the seats, so my passengers or I are always prepared for a top-down drive.  
 

--- Negatives of the pre-1999 Miata ---
Miatas do not have tilt wheels.  Since they are already somewhat cramped for many drivers, the stationary wheel can make it even more difficult for some to enter and exit the driver's seat.  

The plastic rear window can be a pain.  It is annoying, although not time consuming, to always un-lock the roof, unzip and lower the window, cover the window, and then finally lower the roof every time I want to drive topless.  The new Miatas do not have this problem.  For older Miatas, aftermarket companies offer glass window replacements, which include a nice defroster.  

Visibility with the top up is severely restricted out of both rear corners.  When, in a few years, it comes time to replace my top, I will be purchasing one that has plastic rear quarter windows.  Yes, those tops look a bit strange, but they offer tremendously increased visibility out the side/back.

Coupled with reduced driver visibility with the top up is your reduced visibility on the road.  Miatas are TINY in this day of the SUV.  If you find yourself in a Miata on the road, remember, you are INVISIBLE!!! They often cannot or do not see you out there!

I have become a careful, defensive driver in my Miata.  Often I look over at a pickup or an Expedition, and realize my eyes are at their foot level.  While I could outrun them, I certainly would not want to meet them in an accident.  I always drive with the assumption that they do not see me, and I stay out of their way accordingly.  

Road noise can be excessive. The top does not block a lot of noise, so driving next to large vehicles on the freeway can be almost deafening at times.  On the plus side, this noise prevents you from being able to hear on a cell phone, thus making the roads a bit safer =)

Trunk space is notoriously tiny on Miatas.  I have become the master trunk packer, and two of us actually went camping comfortably for a weekend with everything (tent, sleeping bags, food, clothes, etc) packed carefully in the back. I have accumulated many small duffel bags that can be fitted into the strange nooks and crannies of the Miata trunk.  Yes, the trunk is small. I have to plan carefully if I go to Costco, and either the passenger ends up with a lapful of groceries, or I go alone.  If you need a lot of trunk space, this car could be a big problem for you.  

I have always changed my own oil.  The compactness of the Miata's engine compartment has beaten me.  I have changed the oil on this car a few times, but I found it nowhere near worth the trouble. I had to drive it up on blocks, contort myself under and into the car, and pray for traction.  The tiny oil filter requires a tiny filter cap/wrench to get it off, and even fitting that onto the filter took some more contortions.  Give me the space of my F-150 engine any day!


--- Notes on the 1999 revision ---
I have a close friend with a new Miata.  I must say that 90% of the changes Mazda incorporated were improvements- who knew my perfect car could be improved so much?!

Pros:
* The new soft top is lighter and easier to operate- I can close it while sitting in the driver's seat (I have to stand up to have enough leverage to pull mine up).  The top also comes with a glass rear window with a defroster, and there is no need to unzip the window before lowering the top!
* The pop-up headlights are gone in favor of the nice almond-shaped lights.
* Trunk space is much improved by moving the spare tire down under the trunk- you can now fit a square suitcase into the trunk!
* The body seems well braced, and body shake at freeway speeds is slightly less than in my 1996.

Cons:
*The center console was poorly redesigned.  Mazda moved the cup holder into the console, so that it is practically impossible to use it, and it is far from convenient.  
I was partial to the location of the radio down low, near the stick shift.  The radio is now up high, and I find the generic, small buttons hard to navigate with out looking down and studying them.
*I am not sure about the seats, yet. The first struck me as flatter across the back, and thus less comfortable, but I am beginning to think they are equally comfortable as the older ones.


Overall, this will be the one car I doubt I will ever sell. My sedans, pick-ups, wagons, etc. may come and go, but my Miata is part of my family now... it's here to stay =)<br><br>
