            This was the first vehicle I have ever bought on my own (recent college graduate) and the fourth that I have ever owned/driven on a regular basis. I spent a lot of time researching cars and trucks (including on this site) and ultimately decided that a light truck was right for my needs. I needed something that I can haul my musical gear around in, something that is useful for general moving and light hauling, something that could handle the snow and sleet of Berkshire winters, and, most of all, a reliable truck that gets decent mileage. I believe I made the right decision in buying a '94 Toyota pickup.

I spent four months looking for just the right truck; I knew I was looking for a Toyota, and I prioritized the options as follows:
1. Extended Cab
2. 4x4
3. Manual Transmission
4. V6 Engine

I looked at several newer Tacomas but never found one in my price range (under 7 grand) with even 3 of these options. My current truck has all four. It also came with a bedliner, a cap, and auto-locking hubs for the 4WD. Here are my comments on various areas of performance:

<b>How Does it Drive?</b>

This truck is a pleasure to drive. It accelerates and brakes nicely, and is easy to shift. This was my first car with a manual transmission and I was able to learn it very quickly. Even with the V6, you will end up downshifting on steep hills pretty often, but if you know how to manipulate the gears you can keep this thing moving along very well. On the highway it maintains speed pretty well and mine doesn't drift or buck. Make sure you check the suspension and alignment on a Toyota when you get one, as it is fairly common that a previous owner might not have maintained them as well as you would hope. If they get knocked around in a minor accident or something it's fairly common to see them develop a drift issue. 

The handling has the typical mushy Toyota steering you'll find prior to some of the newer models. I've driven new Tacomas and my parents' new Camry and the steering is much more responsive, but on the older trucks and cars it's generally not that great. Once you get used to it, however, the truck corners pretty well and is not so bulky that it's tough to park or turn around. 

<b>Is it Comfortable?</b>

Not particularly. Again, this was a major downside of Toyotas for a long time and apparently still is in some cases. The price you pay for that light-truck handling and parking is a pretty small, narrow cab. The reason I got an extended cab (aside from the convenience) is that anyone over six feet tall will not be comfortable shifting in a standard cab Toyota. I'm 6'2" and just couldn't get comfortable in a regular cab. 

The seats are not particularly comfortable, although you can adjust them pretty easily and I've got covers and cushions on mine. Personally I'm willing to drop sixty bucks on that kind of stuff if it means I'll get a truck that runs right for a long time, so I knew this was how it would be and was ready for it. The 'seats' in the back are big enough for small children or one extremely tolerant adult. I use them for storage purposes only. 

<b>Is it Rugged?</b>

Sort of. If by 'rugged' you mean able to haul heavy loads (<i>light</i> truck, people), drive up mountains with no modifications, park on top of smaller trucks, etc.... I would have to say no. If by 'rugged' you mean durable - in the sense of running forever - and fairly straightforward to maintain or modify, then yeah, I guess it's kind of rugged. For me, the question was more about reliability than being rugged, but I've found that my truck is actually kind of tough to boot. 

Right after I got this truck I backed it into a ditch full of big rocks (hey, nobody's perfect) and it started making a horrible grinding noise after I pulled it out. It sounded like some piece of the brakes or the axle was stuck in the wheel base and rattling around, which ticked me off. Turns out I had just bent the mudflap and it was impeding the wheel - I took a hammer to it and pow, no more noise. This is the kind of stuff I've ended up having to repair on this truck - piddly little things that happen when a vehicle gets over 120,000 miles. I had a couple of bolts pop off that were holding the exhaust pipe in place because they hadn't been replaced with the rest of the pipe and had rusted out. Again, sounded kind of bad, but not a big deal. 

If you really want to take this truck off-road (I don't particularly, but it is kind of fun) you will want to lift it and put some nastier tires on it. This is really true of most trucks, but most people seem to think the Toyota can't handle it. I don't really agree. But it's not really designed for it, and if that's why you're buying one, go get something else. Mine is tall enough and tough enough to do the incidental off-roading that I expect a truck to do - driving over really nasty dirt roads out in the mountains, that sort of thing. That's all I ask of it.

I got the 4 wheel drive with auto-locking hubs for snow, ice, etc. It is totally adequate, even without any weight in the back of the truck. Put a decent pair of snow tires on this truck and it will do fine in any conditions. Slap on a set of studded snows and a couple of sandbags in the bed and you'll be roaring around in the worst of storms. I personally don't understand why anyone would get a pickup without 4-wheel drive... this just seems like one of the most important functions of a truck, and they handle so poorly in snow with 2-wheel drive.
