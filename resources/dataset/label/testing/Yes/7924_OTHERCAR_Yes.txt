            The Honda Civic as long been the benchmark of all compact coupes and sedans.  I recently had the pleasure of driving a brand new, 2002 EX coupe.  

EXTERIOR
For the new the model change of 2001, Honda refreshed the look of the Civic.  Personally, I prefer the 1996-2000 design.  But most people will like the new design of the Civic.  It is athestically pleasing to the eyes, and it has a nice, streamlined finish.  Also, fit and finish are outstanding and would suggest a much more expensive car then the Civic really is.

INTERIOR
Honda lengthed the Civics wheelbase by a few inches over the previous model.  This adjustment creates even more interior space and room then before.  The Civic differs from most coupes in that regular people can actually sit comfortably in the back seat for an extended period of time.  Headroom is good, even with the standard sunroof that comes with the EX model.  The seats are comfortable, although they good use more side bolstering to provide support during spirited driving.  In usual Honda fashion, the Civic's ergonomics are very good and easy to use.  The Civic is a relatively quite car, although the engine can get a little buzzy during highway cruising, due to the Civic's high revving, VTEC engine.  

PERFORMANCE
The EX coupe comes standard with a 1.7 liter, 127 horsepower engine.  I drove both manual and automatic versions of this engine.  I recommend the manual, since you can get better power and accerlation than the with the automatic.  The 5 speed manual transmission shifts very smoothly and the clutch is very easy to use for even a beginner.  

VALUE
The Civic EX coupe with the standard manual transmission stickers for around 17k-19k depending on the dealership.  Given honda's reputation for reliability and good resale value, the price is reasonable.  Just make sure you get the manual transmission, or you will be hard pressed to get decent power from the Civic's small displacement engine.  Also, the manual gets slighty better gas mileage then the automatic.  Overall, the Honda Civic is an outstanding choice for an entry level car.
