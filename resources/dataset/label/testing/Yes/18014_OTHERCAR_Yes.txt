            Yeah - I had to run out and get one in the fall of '98. After nearly 15 years with my old Toyota,I gave it up for old Dodge flame.

 Here's the scoop- ADD an R/T rear swaybar and 8&quot; rims to kill that pickup nose dive roll and keep Visa full for gas-Gets reality 11-13mpg with 318cid and 3.91 rear gear.

 Have no fear- will pull just about anything any distance without loosing breath. Mine cuts the quarter in 15.2 at 91mph - not bad for this heavy of a beast.

  Nice roomy cab with crappy console(Fixed in newer models) that you can't use with one hand and will leave your fingertips bloody.
Don't make sudden move to change heat or fan- you'll probably knock the gearshift to neutral-NOT COOL.(also fixed in 2000 models.)

Seats need lateral support for average butt(upholsterer charges 50 bucks to do the lateral pad stiffening) 

Engine/body/suspension is bulletproof and highly reliable. As you can tell it takes a few dollars(E pluribus unum-one of the many) to make one 
fit you- once comfy it will complete almost any task asked.
