                 Within the last year my family bought a Toyota Avalon after our 14 year old Nissan died.  We were all very impressed with it from the beginning.  
     It's very spacious. Even in the back seat you have plenty of leg room.  It also has a good amount of storage space.  The heating and air conditioning work very well and make it easy to maintain a comfortable temperature no matter what the weather is like outside of the car.  The seats are all quite comfortable as well.  
      The only drawback that I am aware of is the soundsystem.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds great...when it's working.  We've had problems with it since day one.  First the CD player didn't work at all.  So the dealer replaced it and all was good.  Then a while later the right speaker stopped working.  The next time we took the car in for a tune up we got it fixed.  But only a few days later the left speaker stopped working.  Not long after that the CD player stopped working completely again.  
     Aside from that it's a great car.  Maybe it's just ours, but it is something you may want to look into when you're thinking about getting one.<br><br>
