            One of my volunteer tasks is editing and producing a 12-page monthly newsletter for our lake community club. As an ad agency owner with graphics arts and public relations experience, I took it from a rough paste-up/copier job to a fully digitized publication. One objective was heavy use of human interest photos. Conventional photography and scanning created a time lag and represented unnecessary steps. After shopping around, I purchased a Toshiba PDR M-3. It met my basic criteria: through the lens viewing, as well as LCD monitor (to conserve power), photo quality, good storage and &quot;point and shoot&quot; convenience. It did all I wanted and more. Quality and color are exceptional, comparing favorably with better traditional cameras. It is easy to learn and use. An optional feature called &quot;Flashpath&quot; makes it possible to download pictures from the camera's memory chip to computer via the floppy disk drive. One feature shows thumbnails along the side of your screen which may be dragged and dropped to your graphics program or application of choice. In addition to publication work, I've used the camera successfully for a community web site, print ad photos and product shots. Whether it's for personal photos, e-mail sharing or graphic arts, we recommend this camera as a dependable workhorse, at a realistic cost.  <br><br>
