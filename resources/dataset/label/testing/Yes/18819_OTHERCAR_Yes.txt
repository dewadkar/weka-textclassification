            I Bought this Jeep 15 monthes ago,for my wife, after leasing two Ford Explorers in a row. While the Fords caught My wife's eye,she soon learned that they handled very poorly. (she rolled one) While the Jeep is not the best looking "Bell of the Ball" it delivers when it comes to what is most important,Handling,and Safety,. You get a feeling of confidence in even the worst weather,and it has more than enough passing power on the interstate. As far as value for your money, While your not as pampered as you may be in other SUV vehicles,this Jeep cost thousands less then other vehicles with same mileage,options, etc. Mine has a aftermarket power sunroof,CD-changer,and chrome wheels,just to make it more "user friendly" and was still cheaper.The only mechanical issue is the replacement of the factory muffler and cat converter at only 47,000 miles due to them rotting out.If your thinking about a 4X4 SUV but are still on a budget,you can't go wrong looking for one of these.
