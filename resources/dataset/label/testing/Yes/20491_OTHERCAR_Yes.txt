            Oldsmobile really puts the OOOOOOOO in OLD.  This car is craps.  IT really honestly is just plain C R A P S CRAPS.  When I was going to test drive this car, I thought I would be pleasantly surpised, but the only thing that surprised me was the craps that this car portrayed.  The suspension was horrible, the speed and power reminded me of something that could be pulled by a single horse, maybe a horse that needed to take a big crap.  Do not buy this car.  They attempt to classify this car as &quot;near luxury&quot; but this is actually quite far from luxury.  The inside is cheap, and the features are weak.  The standard stereo is weak, the seats and uncomfortable.  There really isnt much goofd about this at all.  Even the gas mileage wasnt that impressive.  For the price, I would check out any of the 300 series BMWs.  Dont buy this crap.

Bottom line - STAY AWAY!<br><br>
