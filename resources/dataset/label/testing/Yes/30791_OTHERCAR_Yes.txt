            The Olympus D-340-R produces images that will satisfy most amateur photographers. The batteries last a surprisingly long time (4 AA batteries). The camera is simple to use, and produces good images in a wide variety of lighting situations. The colors are well saturated and the optics provide sharp, clear images. The only thing I could have asked for is an optical zoom, which this camera doesn't have.

I bought my D-340-R in January of this year and I've carried it on a number of trips, including a 2-week tour of Tuscany in May. The pictures it takes on the SHQ setting will enlarge to 5x7 with no sign of pixelation or video artifacts. A 16MB SmartMedia card is about equivalent to a 36-exposure roll of film. I have four 16MB SmartMedia cards, but that wasn't sufficient for a long trip, like my recent Italian tour, so I carried a laptop computer with me and transferred my pictures to the hard drive each night.

The camera is light-weight and well-built enough to take a bit of punishment.
