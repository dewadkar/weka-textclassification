            We just bought a new Volvo S40 5 days ago and we love it every day more and more! We test drove like 10 or more different cars/models this spring and Volvo is the best considering features and price. VW Passat is close too but it has bad rear view and short warranty/roadside assistance.
So, our cool red Volvo has a lot of additional features:
*Cold weather package(heated seats, traction control)
*Sunroof package (sunroof,leather and wood trim)
*Touring package(CD,premium sound,8-way power driver seat)
And that's all for $26600 ( we bought it $400 over invoice what we never expected to get)

Our Volvo has a lot of good things actually it's ONE BIG PLUS!
+ Engine is very powerful, because car is not heavy comparing to Audi A4 for example
+ Very comfortable and quiet ride, 70mph  speed feels like 50mph
+ Very attractive price comparing to Audi A4 and Acura TL
+ The interior is just cool and looks great especially with wood trim
+ Looks fancy outside
+ Convenient seats, very roomy even on the back (we didn't expect it)
+ Good rear and side view
+ Good sound isolation
+ It has standard side airbags, immobilizer and alarm. Insurance gives a discount for these features.
+ Volvo has the best dealers in our opinion. We've been in 10 others and maybe GMC/Oldsmobile can only compete.

There are some cons too, but not too serious:
- Wood trim comes only with sunroof package, actually we didn't want sunroof but we liked wood trim , so we were forced to take the package
If somebody know how to make a use of sunroof please let me know, currently I don't see a need and time for it :(
- Front cup holder is designed poorly, it's not useful
- There is no CD storage or just special space, so we are forced to use glove box for this.

I think it's the best deal we could get for our money and it's the most stylish car I saw. It's so comfortable you want to stay inside longer and drive...

To be continued with time ...
-----------------------------------------
Ok,folks,5 months passed and I'd like to add more info.
It's pleasant to drive this car and seats are so comfortable that after 5 hours driving you don't have a backache :) It definitely has very good acceleration what I enjoy entering a highway or passing sleepy drivers. 
So,everything I said before is truth... but it has one bad feature - transmission. It switches loudly and it doesn't matter how softly you press gas pedal :( I'd say it has worse transmission that Chevy Prizm had after 2 years of use. I know S40 2001 has new transmission and I hope it's better than ours...
One more thing: It likes good gasoline, do not use 87 but at least 88-89. Be aware that if gasoline is poor the light 'Check engine' goes ON and stays so till you fill up the better one and ride for a while. BTW, mileage is better than expected: average city/highway is 24.6 Mpg and highway is 29-30 Mpg!<br><br>
