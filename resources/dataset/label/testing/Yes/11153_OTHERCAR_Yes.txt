            After a great deal of research, my wife and I bought a RAV4 to replace our rapidly decaying Geo.  After owning it for over a year, we both believe it is a great investment, and in spite of brutal weather, potholes, and the dings and scratches of city life, it runs great and looks even better.

At the time we purchased it, there was very limited availability; hence poor selection and little opportunity to negotiate price.  The best tactic we used was to send all the dealers in our area an e-mail with the specs we wanted, and had them bid to us.  The bids came in at a crazy range - $18k-26k.  It pays to shop around!

Our RAV

We lucked out and got Spectra Blue Mica for a color.  At the time we bought it seemed only silver was available.  We have 4WD, automatic transmission, and a roof rack.  We also got the quick-order package, which includes A/C, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, carpeted floor mats, and an AM/FM casette/CD player with 6 speakers.  For some reason we also ended up with mud flaps but weren't charged for them.  We also added a moon roof.  One note about that:  we thought we were getting a Toyota moon roof, but our dealer sent the car to a shop in the burbs and an after-market moon roof was installed.  I didn't notice until I looked at the odometer and it registered 125 miles (we bought it with 1!!).  Finally, we got the RS3200 keyless entry / alarm system.  The total price was $19,750.

Cargo Space

At first glance, the RAV looks like a tiny car.  It is, in fact, very short from front to back.  This makes it really easy to parallel park, and our current residence has a cramped little parking lot so it is easy to zip in and out.  By removing the rear seats, however, you get a fabulous amount of cargo space.  Every time we shop for furniture or other large items, I am surprised by how much fits in the car.  What doesn't fit in the cabin gets strapped to the roof rack.

Handling

The RAV feels more like a car than a truck.  The engine is peppy and provides a quick burst of speed when needed.  The steering is crisp, with almost no sway, even when cornering quickly or avoiding other drivers.  It gets a little noisy in the cabin when on the interstate, but since we rarely leave the city, we don't notice this often.  It is also nice to sit up higher because you can see traffic problems developing and get more time to react.

Reliability

Through 2 Chicago winters, the RAV has started right up and pulled its way through sleet, snow, and torrential rain.  The engine has never hesitated to start.  It took time to get used to it not going into overdrive until warmed up, but this car rarely goes above 25-30 mph anyway.

Style

My wife is an elementary school teacher and drives to work every day.  The children at her school are in awe of the car.  We still get compliments about how great the car looks (like we had anything to do w/ that...).

Seating & the Ride

My wife and I are both short, so the cabin feels cavernous to us.  The seats are very comfortable, and the driver's seat adjusts vertically as well as horizontally to help find the ideal position.  We have plenty of head room and leg room in front, as well as in back.  A neat feature of the back seats is you can adjust them forwards and backwards to gain a little more leg room or cargo room.  We have transported 5 people at one time, in relative comfort, but never for very long trips.

Our only long trip was from Chicago to Raleigh, NC.  Returning home, we did the trip in one day with no discomfort other than extreme boredom.  On that trip I did notice there is no place on which to rest your elbow while driving, and this lead to some arm fatigue after several hours.  We both commented as we returned home how, after 13+ hours, we were neither sore nor exhausted from the trip.  That said, I still prefer to fly.

The RAV is quite noisy on the interstate and at highway speeds.  This is more due to wind than engine noise.  The suspension is also fairly tight, making those potholes feel a little bigger than they really are.  Otherwise, the ride is really nice.

The Downers

Our gas mileage started out great - between 23-27 mpg.  However, the last 7 months has seen a decline to around 18-19 mpg.  Despite meticulous maintenance, it just doesn't get the promised mileage.  We are also disappointed with the annoying squeaks and rattles that seem to come from new places every week.  They are never consistent, however, so you never know which rattle or squeak will be riding shotgun that day.  We have also noticed that at highway speeds you have to plan ahead to pass someone b/c the engine power often just isn't there.  Regardless, you would never want to go much over 75 mph in this car - it isn't built for speed!

Summary

We hope to drive this car for 10 years, maybe more.  It was an excellent value for the price we paid, looks good, and drives well.  We're looking forward to future road trips, camping expeditions, and, heck, just getting the groceries on the weekend.
