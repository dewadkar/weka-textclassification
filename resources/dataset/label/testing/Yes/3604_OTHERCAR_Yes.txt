            This is the camera which is bringing me back to the world of photography.  The first two places I attempted to order it from were bogus and attempted to see me their "special package" deal.  I finally went with Buydig, paid a few more dollars, but received it in three days.  I love all the features, the quantity of pictures and resolution I get from this camera.  Photos are second to none in the digital arena.  Flash cards are relatively inexpensive now ($45 for 128 megs). I can take pictures all day and review what I take. If I don't like the picture, I delete it with a click of the button.  The movie feature is really nice too.  I can play movies back with sound for my friends and if I use up on of my flash cards, I just pop a new one it.  I found rechargeable lithium batteries for about $21 bucks from Amazon and if I need a recharged battery, I just put it in.  Black and white format is really cool for the old time pictures.  Once a picture is taken, you can actually zoom in on it and really look at it in detail.  If I want to know exactly what format the camera was in during the shot, I can click on it's menu and it'll show the ASA/speed and which F stop  it was at. The shot menu also show what time/date the picture was taken and even has a histogram graph showing the lighting the shot was taken at.  A really neat feature is its ability to hook right up to the computer, TV or printer.  I've got a lot of reading to do, but it is going to be worth it.  This is one heck of a camera!
