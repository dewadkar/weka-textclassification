            This car simply rocks!! I bought this car after I decided that I could not be happy in the 1999 BMW Z3 Coupe that I had purchased 6 months previous. 

It started out as a statement from a friend online &quot;Don't go test drive this car unless you're ready to buy it.&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;yeah right, it's just an Audi A4..&quot; That's where the difference lies. This car maybe an A4 body but in reality this car is so much more. 

I was fortunate when I purchased the car in December of 1999, as they had just started arriving and not many dealers in the Washington DC area had deposits on them. After shopping five dealers, I settled on a small dealer that did not mark up the price of the car - however, be prepared to pay full sticker on this car. I don't know if dealers are still charging full sticker now but that was the case back in January. 

This car should be compared to the previous style BMW M3. Although a new model is coming out soon that should give the S4 a decent run for the money. 


The car has a kickbutt engine! Smooth, you don't realize how fast you're going until you look down at the speedo. The seats are awesome on long trips - I racked up 1,200 miles in them in one day and was not at all fatigued. The optional Bose sound system is very good and much better than most optional factory sound systems. 

The suspension is a little soft for my tastes (especially when compared with a '97 VW GTi VR6 with H&amp;R Coilovers) and the shifter is really balky. That said, those items can be easily improved with the plethora of aftermarket parts already available for the S4. 

Minor complaints for the best $40,000 car money can buy. Think Porsche 996 w/four doors. Add an aftermarket chip and you've got a VERY worthy competitor to the soon-to-come-to-the-US BMW M3.
