            We purchased the Dodge Grand Caravan last week because I have been getting a little clausterphobic and hated staying home while daddy had the ONLY vehicle!. My husband has reserved himself to "big blue".. the other car we have, and doesn't even bother asking for the keys to THIS baby! It's MOMMAS!

First of all, it has TONS of room! My youngest girls car seats fit comfortably and snugly. The adjustable seatbelts allow for firm, secure safety. Two cup holders build into the sides on eather side of the far back seat...the same seat that can be REMOVED to provide more space. There is also a flip-up compartment my son uses to hide his gameboy when we exit the vehicle. Then, attatched underneath the center of the front bench seat is another pull out cup holder with two more adjustable holders!. Finally, there is another 2 adjustable cup holders up front and a compartment/pull-out-drawer underneath the passenger seat. This drawer is able to lock with your door key and can hold anything from important files, to CD's or tapes (it is designed to hold them). 
Along the back upper panel are push lights that the kids can push if they want to read (or play gameboy) and even when on, it remains dark enough for the driver to not be distracted. It has 2 (maybe more?) swing-down clothes hangers that push back up into the wall when not used. The front passenger visors not only have mirrors , but have a plastic shield that can be pulled out on the rearview mirror side of the visors to block the sun that shines BETWEEN the visors at certain times of day!! If that is not enough, there is a compartment above that, when pushed, flips open to reveal a holder for sunglasses!

Secondly, I have found that the seat not only fits my small 5'1" frame comfortably, but also fits my husbands 6'3" frame JUST as comfortably! The arm rests flip up to allow you ease of moving around or you can keep them down and rest your elbows. It has cruise, horn and other things right on the steering wheel making it easy to push while driving! The standard Radio/Cassette is just fine for us and the speakers are the best factory speakers I've ever had! It comes with thick, nice feet mats and cleans easily!. Though the back windows pop open a degree, I prefer to use the air conditioning! My kids absolutely LOVE the air vents by their seats which allows the air to directly cool them off FAST! They are used to sitting in "big blue" and W-A-I-T-I-N-G to cool off! The best thing has got to be the two sliding doors on eather side! What a complete blessing this van is! No more bending in , bending over, or twisting yourself into a pretzel!

Finally, The Dodge Grand Caravan not only looks great with it's privacy tinted windows, Sporty chrome wheel caps and bug guard (optional)...it is a very surprisingly fast vehicle. It not only can get-up-and-GO...it can stop on a dime...just remember to give your self a little more room in stopping distance because of weight! Though the glove compartment box is not as large as others we have had, I am not at ALL complaining!

I hope this has helped! I have only had my van for a week so I may find out even MORE!....it MIGHT just DO-MY-DISHES!!

 Of course I can't say this product is "excellent" because it's not a fair assumption my only having it for a week, however...I recommend this product to anyone wanting affordable comfort, economical space and something BETTER than the JONESES!
