            	I have purchased a 1997 corolla CE model back in late 1996.  I am a college student that lives approximately 300 miles away from home.  Needless to say, I needed a car that's reliable and gas-efficient.  Corolla is an inexpensive car that will get you from point A to B.  My car is currently 3 years old and has over 45k miles on it and still running great.  Other than regular maintenance done every 30k (only once in my case), the struts (shocks) are still great.  I've often heard about manufacturing struts that wears down at about 30k miles, but the auto-mechanic surprisingly told me that it didn't need to be changed anytime soon (within 2 years).  
	This car has a gas tank capacity of about 12 gallons.  It indicates empty with roughly 1 to 2 gallons left.  I've never had to push the car due to an empty tank though many times I have taken it below the E-line on the gas gauge.  The car can get up to 35 miles per gallon max on the freeway and in the mid 20s during traffic jams and locals.  
	For the price between 15k to 20k, corolla may not have the strongest engine.  But it will last for years to come and saves you money on maintenance and gas expenses.  The feel of the overall car is that of a tiny luxury car.  It does not feel sporty, nor is it comfortable like a lexus.  Perfect for a college student until later years you can say.
	Universities often have few parking spaces and lots of lousy drivers.  The size of the car therefore, plays an important role to those who are in crowded residential areas.  On top of this, there are always students that scratch up fancy cars on purpose.  Corolla is not the type of car that attracts people's attention, but it will do for college students or younger drivers.   <br><br>
