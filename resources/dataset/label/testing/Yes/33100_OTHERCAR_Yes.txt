            I am not going to quote all the vehicles specifications but strongly suggest comparing the Jimmy�s specifications to other SUV�s on the market. By doing this you will see that it has the best specifications in almost all categories. I bought my Jimmy new and was very impressed at how easily my wife adapted to driving the Jimmy after driving a Pontiac Sunfire. The Jimmy genuinely handles like a car and after having driven a compact you tend to notice little things like ease of parking. The Jimmy is very nimble and handles easily for a vehicle of its size. Running costs of the Jimmy are very good and considering the 4.3l V6 engine, fuel consumption is excellent. I take my Jimmy into a GM service center every 4 months for routine service at an average cost of Cdn$30. This means that aside from fuel it costs me less than $10 a month to maintain the vehicle and have a GM documented service record. I don�t do any work on the vehicle and have only opened the hood twice (once when I bought the Jimmy and once to add some window washer fluid). After more than a year of ownership I have had no problems at all with the vehicle. Here is a list of reasons why I favor the Jimmy; 1) I think the Jimmy is one of the best-looking SUV�s. 2) It has the most power in its class with the best fuel efficiency. 3) Very well appointed (power seats and a host of neat gadgets). 4) Extremely comfortable, I have driven 9-hour runs without having to stop and stretch. 5) Excellent cargo space thanks to the 60-40 split, rear seats folding flat. 6) On-the-fly four-wheel drive is awesome (I have been able to engage 4WD in a skid and correct/pull-out. 7) Very quiet interior even at highway speeds. I have had many passengers� comment on how quiet the ride was.

I only have two complaints with the Jimmy; 1) I am quite tall (6�3) and when I am turning right in the vehicle the rearview mirror obstructs my vision to the extent that I have to look around it. A similar problem happens when I stop at a traffic light and I am first at the intersection, I cannot look up and see the overhead signal lights without bending forward. 2) I don�t know if it is a product of how quiet the interior of the Jimmy is or that some of the squeaks from the door and dash panels are that loud.
