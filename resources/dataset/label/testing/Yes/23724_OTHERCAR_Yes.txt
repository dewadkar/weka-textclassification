            I was looking for a 4 MP or better camera with a decent optical zoom range for less than $500 - so when Minolta came out with the S404 as a new model this Spring (2202), I was practically sold just on the past quality of this brand name alone. This camera met my above criteria, plus having the flexibility of using this camera as either just a simple point and shoot fully automatic camera, or to be able to have full control over key things like shutter speed priority, aperature priority and focusing.

I also wanted a compact camera that was not "bulky" (as the Minolta Dimage 5 and 7 are). This camera will not disappoint you, and with 4 MP, it is good for either very large prints (11 X 17), or enlarging cropped photos a lot.

There are a large number or cons / quirks I outline below, but none of them are serious enough to take a lot away from this fine camera. Just be aware of them.

Pros - Detailed description:
All stuff mentioned above, plus a 95% metal body (only a few things were plastic - like the mode dial, Compact flash card door and preview screen).

Photo quality is excellent for most shots.

Minolta glass multi-segment optics / lens are very high quality and sharp.

Camera has digital zoom, but I leave this off, as it really doesn't gain me anything - really. I can do all the "zooming" I want digitaly by using the photo editing software provided.

Very flexible as far as manual adjustments are concerned. Shutter & aperature priority mode, white balance, shutter speed and ISO "film speed" can all be manually adjusted and set if you want. Or just leave it in the fully automatic mode, and simply point & shoot!


Cons - Detailed description:
1.) Too easy to turn mode dial. Just putting the camera into my camera bag has turned the mode dial on. Early on I would not discover this to much later when I pulled the camera out of the bag and found the batteries to be dead.

2.) Audio sound bite of a 35mm camera sound when taking a picture. Sounds cheezy! Just give me a regular beep when taking a photo - that's all thats really needed.

3.) Date stamp looks awful. Date stamp looks very obvious when you see it, and draws your eyes right to it when viewing photos. Minolta can easily fix this with their next software revision. I've turned my date stamp off.
(you don't really need a date stamp on the picture itself, as the date and other info is recorded as part of the digital picture - but you don't see this info in the photo itself. Editing software allows you to view the date, plus other things like shutter speed and aperture settings that were used when the picture was taken).

4.) When turning the camera on, it defaults so that the preview screen is on all the time. I always turn the screen off immediatly when turning the camera on to save batteries. Minolta should allow you when setting up the camera so that the screen does not always default so it's on.

5.) The tripod screw mount is on the extreme end of the camera, instead of being in the center where it should be.

6.) When photo preview is "on", you must press the shutter release to clear the previewed picture and save it. THEN you can press the shutter release again to take another picture. This is very annoying, except of course when you DO want to preview pictures before saving them. Fortunately, you can program the camera so that preview mode is off, and you don't have to worry about pressing the shutter release button twice when taking pictures in quick succession. Therefore, I now leave the photo preview mode off, and only turn it on if I really need to preview the picture.

7.) As stated in the other reviews, the non- NiMh batteries and compact flash card supplied are simply throw in's without any real value. Plan on spending another $150 above and beyond from the basic camera for:
Two 128MB compact flash cards ($50 each at Costco), qty. 12 NiMh batteries & quick charger (having at least two complete sets of charged spare batteries is a must with all digital cameras), and a carrying case. 

8.) Plastic lense cover supplied seems very cheezy, and is sometimes hard to put on.

9.) Plastic compact flash card door seems cheap - should have been metal to match rest of camera body. Door itself is blocked by the neck strap bracelet attaching the strap to the camera. 

10.) Easy to block flash with your fingers when holding camera in a normal way.

11.) Battery life is very low, common to nearly all digital cameras. After about 30 minutes, the camera body gets very warm to the touch - caused by the rapidly draining batteries! After about 60 minutes of being in the "on" mode (with preview screen off), the high capacity 1850 mh NiMh batteries I use are dead. You MUST use NiMh batteries, and have two complete sets ready with you (so you will need to buy qty. 12 NiMh batteries right away). This camera uses qty. 4 AA batteries, so in a bind you can always use common AA size alkalines, available most anywhere.

12.) It takes two seconds for the camera to "boot up" and be ready to take a picture. While two seconds doesn't seem all that long, after a day of using the camera while occasionally taking pictures, you end up turning the camera on and off a lot to save battery life. As the day wears on and photo opportunities present themselves quickly, that two seconds gets to seem like it's a very long time till you are able to actually take a picture.

Many of these quirks are dealt with as you get used to the camera, and begin automatically compensating for them after you have used the camera a while. The mode button being too easy to turn is the most annoying, however.
