            The Suzuki Swift is a compact vehicle that provides its owners with great efficiency. It is small, compact and as a result an easy and safe car to drive. It's 1.3 liter engine gives good fuel economy and a smooth drive. It only has one draw back though; it is a small car and can seat not more than 4 adult people. Even though it is comfortable, reliable and safe it is not very roomy or spacious so it would probably not suite people who like a spacious interior. Available in a variety of colors this car is ideal for the common every day man who cannot afford an expensive car but can enjoy the same comfort and luxury for a lower and affordable price.<br><br>
