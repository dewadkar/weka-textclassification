            I have own three honda prelude in the past five years not to say there is a problem with them but each time i have upgraded years. i had an 85 prelude it actually was my first car ever. i loved this little car it took me were ever i want to go. when i bought it, it had 160,000 miles on it i was eary about getting it but friends told me hey it is a honda it will last a long time. so i bought it well i got this car up to 257,000 miles before i really had any problems with it. then instead of taking care of the problems i gave the car to my brother and then i bought an 1988 honda prelude well this had 123,000 miles on it once again it last up too 230,000 miles before i traded it in for a 92 prelude and let me tell you i loved still. this car is so smooth just as the other ones were. the only thing is is that i would not recommend this to a family for a family car. there is not enough room in the back seat to put anyone even if the person is small. i do know that this car will last me a long time just like the other ones so i would recommend this to any one especially first time car buyers. these car are not that expensive and what you do pay is worth it.<br><br>
