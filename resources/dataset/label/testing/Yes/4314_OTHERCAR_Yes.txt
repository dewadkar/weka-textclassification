            Do you remember the old Toyota ads where the owner jumped into the air and the music sang &quot;I love what you do for me&quot;?  In a nutshell, that is how I feel about the Toyota Corolla.

I bought mine in 1994 and knock on wood, I have only had one mechanical problem and that was the back power window needed a new motor.  It happened the day after my warranty was over (figures), but the dealership found a way to split the cost with Toyota and it only cost me $100.  So, it will be six years in May, I will have only paid out $100 for something other than normal maintenance!  That's pretty amazing!  And I have to add, I'm not one of those really conscientious people that remembers to get my oil changed every 3,000 miles or go in when I'm called for a major tune-up.  In fact, my husband gets embarrassed about he forgets to check out my car to make sure everything's fine.  It just always is!

The mileage I get is superb, too.  Once again, I'm not very particular about paying attention to details of my car, but I only fill my tank every couple of weeks and I would consider myself the average &quot;Jill&quot; as far as mileage is concerned.

On the downside, sometimes I wish I had an SUV because it's tough bending over to get my son out of the carseat in the back and I feel like I'm a tiny little car among all the huge SUV's.  My husband thinks it's a little squirrel-y on the road, but he still enjoys driving it and he has a truck if that says anything!

As far as looks, I feel like it has a look that it's not an economy car, but rather an affordable car with a touch of luxury.  Does that make sense?  It feels like for a tiny car, it still gets respect on the road.

My model is the &quot;DX&quot; which has all the extra bells and whistles such as power doors and windows, and that adds a lot to its value for me and as I understand to the resale value, as well.

I highly recommend this car.  It's dependable, comfortable to drive in, and affordable.  I really do &quot;love what it's done for me.&quot;<br><br>
