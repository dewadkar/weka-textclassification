            Ford Taurus is a great car.  It is not too expensive first of all.	 For the price you are paying you get plenty of quality.  The acceleration on my 1996 model is great, i can burn just about any other car in a race.  I�ve had this car for over a year and i have not had any problems with it at all.  The gas mileage is about average as are the breaks.  The sterio is awesome and the power steering is very convinient.  The car is visually attractive and Taurus� tend to last a while, so its a good investment<br><br>
