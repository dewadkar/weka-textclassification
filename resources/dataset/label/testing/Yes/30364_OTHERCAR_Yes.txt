                 Living in Motown (Detroit) and working in the auto industry, I see many vehicles before the rest of the country does. When I saw an early prototype of the Aztek, I thought as many others do that it was butt-ugly. In fact, the other engineers I worked with called it the &quot;Giant Chevette.&quot; Not exactly a flattering reference. 

     Well, since the early prototype days, General Motors has softened the hatchback styling of this vehicle slightly. However, it still is a very unique-looking SUV. The aggressive styling will catch your eye first, even if it is only to say, &quot;Look at that ugly car.&quot; But as with many vehicles that are different than those are already on the market, you can get used to the style and even appreciate it. 

     Here in Detroit, there are many early-production Azteks already on the road, and even in our parking lot as I type. Seeing them on a daily basis has gotten me accustomed to the look and even piqued my curiosity about owning one. With a growing family, I was dreading the eventual move into a minivan (or nerd van as we always called them growing up.)I feel that the Aztek is a &quot;cooler&quot; alternative to a minivan, and that is exactly the target the GM is trying to hit with this vehicle.

     It offers all the functionality of a minivan and then some. Some of the unique features it offers are the removable console cooler, the slide-out package tray and rear cargo-area audio controls. I've always said that cars should have some kind of cooler in them, and this Pontiac is the first to has a removable one that I know of. I think it would come in handy to most drivers. 

     Some optional features that are available on the Aztek as on other Pontiacs are the frontal and side airbags, a driver information center, OnStar (emergency assistance) and a &quot;head up display.&quot; The HUD displays on the lower portion of your windshield: your speed, blinkers, radio station and emergency messages like low fuel and service engine soon. If you have ever driven a vehicle with the HUD, you know it's difficult to go back to one without it. It's much more convenient to keep your eyes straight ahead than to look down at the gages and cluster.

     The engine on this vehicle is an acceptable 3.4 L V6. For my purposes, the engine provides all the power and acceleration I need. For some hard-core drivers who want to climb mountains, the engine may be underpowered, but I feel for everyday use, you will experience no problems with it. I have not yet driven this vehicle, but as a passenger, I experienced a smooth, minivan-like ride, only a bit stiffer, as you would expect in a sporty Pontiac.

     The interior is as roomy as the minivan of this size, and has more space inside than a typical SUV, like the Chevy Blazer. The Aztek will hold five passengers, or my case, a baby seat, some extra kids and their belongings. In addition, the seats are reconfigurable and fold down, if you'd rather use the interior room to haul things instead of people. The instrument panel has the &quot;bug-eye&quot;  air condition outlets as seen in other Pontiacs, but an otherwise pleasant finish. 

     The Aztek's price is within the range that you would expect to pay for a minivan ($22-25,000.) with all the features I have mentioned. Perhaps because I am a woman and a mother, I have a different perspective than other reviewers. As I said, the styling has begun to grow on me, and the Aztek offers the functionality I am looking for without looking like a typical &quot;nerd van.&quot; So I am ready to purchase one for my next vehicle. Watch out for me - I'm sure you'll see me coming!<br><br>
