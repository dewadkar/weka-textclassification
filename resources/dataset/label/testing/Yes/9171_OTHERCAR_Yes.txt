            When we started looking for a new car it was going to be a Volkswagon Passat or a Toyota Camry.  Little did my husband know that I'd fall in love with the RAV4 (2000 model) instead.  I had a Honda Civic before so I like the agility of the RAV4.  It felt like I'd been driving it for years-it fit just like a nice pair of gloves.  
But, just because I liked it didn't mean I could have it.  My husband wanted to do a little extra research first.  How did Consumer Reports rate it and how much would insurance be?  In his research he discovered that Consumer Reports rated it as one of the best small SUV's on the market.  He also found that our insurance would go down slightly in purchasing this vehicle.  So we went on the hunt for that perfect RAV4.
The one thing we discovered in searching for the vehicle is that the dealerships do not have many in stock.  If you want added features like a sunroof or 4WD you have to order it.  Luckily we wanted a more basic model and found the one in a color I really liked.
I love the way it drives and handles.  It is very easy to get in and out of.  It was also very easy to get my daughter's booster seat into.  Most of the time I have a hard time strapping car seats and booster seats into a car, but this was extremely easy to put in and get the strap tight enough to hold well.  Probably the only thing I don't like about it is the amount of leg room the driver has.  My husband is 6'2&quot; and would like to be able to put the seat back a little farther.  But for me at 5'8&quot; it is just perfect and since I am the principle driver it is fine.  
I would recommend that very tall people not purchase this car because it would be somewhat cramped for them.  Also, a family of 5 would be cramped in it.  But a small family of 3 or 4 may like it.
Overall I really love my new car and hope to drive it for many years to come.  I don't think I'll go back to a car anytime in the near future.<br><br>
