            I just got my brand new 2001 ML320. Silver/Ash. Moon roof, Bose stereo, phone, 6 cd changer.

I had a 2000 Tahoe before the Benz, and it was stolen, and never recovered. So after the claim was settled, I began a massive search for the perfect SUV. My choices were the BMW MX5 and the ML320.

After driving both, the ML320 felt just right, maybe not as fast as the BMW, but fast enough.

I got the car 2 weeks ago, and the more I drive it, the more I love it. Superior handling, excellent Bose stereo, better than average gas mileage, the brakes are excellent. The interior is just the best there is.

The feature that really is amazing, is the hands free phone system. The sound quality from the 7 speakers is excellent, also the mic is amazing, no body could tell that I was on hands free, even at high speeds. The CD or radio mutes automatically when you receive a call.

The transition and engine is silky smooth. You can drive the car as a 5 speed manual, just tap the lever to the - or +. 

Not to say the Chevy is a horrible car, but really it does not even compare to the Benz, two different worlds.

Lastly, every one that sits in the car, or drive it, just falls in love.
