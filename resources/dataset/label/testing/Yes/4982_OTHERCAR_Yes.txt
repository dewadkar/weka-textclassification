            <i>Hello</i>


<b>1992 Toyota Paseo:</b>

What happened to the Toyota Paseo? Toyota must of stopped production on these nice little, sleek coupes. Still see a number of them running on the roads. I remember when I had my 92 Paseo. It was aqua green with light gray interior and it had a standard, five speed transmission. I owned this car for about a year and a half. Since I owned many cars before, this is one of the many opinions you will see on cars under my name. 


<b>Background on cars:</b>

I worked on a used car dealership for over four years and sold only import cars like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Acura, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, etc. I like only imports so most of my opinions are on import cars. My number one priority in a car is it's dependability and over all quality. These come before power, size and fame.


<b>The Paseo basics:</b>

The Toyota Paseo comes in only one body style and it only comes with one type of engine. The body is a two-door coupe with 14-inch tires, front wheel drive. The engine is a supped up Tercel engine, which is a 1.5 L Twin Cam, 16-valve, multi port fuel injection with 115-Bhp. This amount of horsepower will only come out if the engine revs with at least 5000-Rpm. Some models come with rear spoiler and alloy wheels. Also a moonroof which is manualy operated. Mine had both. The Paseo also comes with standard power steering and a tachometer to show you the rpm. Two types of transmissions: four speed automatic and a 5-speed standard. 
I liked the smooth automatic transmission when I drove an automatic Paseo. This was not my car.


<b>Why like it:</B>

Like every Toyota these days, the Paseo is a very reliable car. It always starts and the engine a is relatively quiet despite it's small size. The Paseo is also fun to drive. This car has a very tasteful design as well. It looks like a bigger, more powerful sports car from the distance. It is relatively stable on the road. The suspension is very comfortable compared to a Honda Civic, which I also owned. Here we compromise. The Paseo has the tendency to under steer but on the straight road, it gives you a smooth comfortable ride compared to a Honda Civic. The seats are quiet comfortable at the front and the shifter is soft.


<b>Why do not:</b>

Why don't like this little sports car when it is so cute? Here is why; my annoyances are lack of roominess, traction in snow, loose shifter, and underpowered engine. This car has back seats but forget about putting your family in it. Even bigger kids like teenagers will not fit at the back. Adults? Absolutely not! There is no headroom at the back for adults. Even if you are a short person, your head will touch the rear window. No legroom either. This car will go nowhere in the snow. The weight of the car is very light and the tires are wide for this car. Tire size: 185/60/14
If there is snow, you will get stuck in it, especially up to a hill. I recommend aggressive treaded snow tires for the winter if you want to drive it in the winter time. The shifter on the 5-spd is loose, even when it is in gear. The engine has 115-hp but it feels like 70.


<b>After all:</b>

I highly recommend this car to a single person who does a lot of urban commuting alone or with another person and no passengers / children at the back. Don't try to race other cars with it. It is a fast looking car but it only has high-end power. No torque. In the winter I personally, recommend Bridgestone Blizzak Ice grippers all around. Otherwise, you will get stuck. The radio is average with no optional CD Player unless you install a third party one.
Since Toyota does not manufacture these cars anymore, you cannot buy a new one. If you are looking for a reliable, nice looking import and cannot afford a new vehicle, this is the car for you. Ps: You must be single!
