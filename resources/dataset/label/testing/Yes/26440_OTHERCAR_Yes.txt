            I finally bought the Accord coupe EX-V6 (I waited to see the 2004 look, and decide I like the current look more) 
I find the current 2002 Accord coupe very elegant, classy and sporty. The lines are very clean. The backlights are my favorite. The square plus the triangle lights are so nice. It is a car of its own since I can't think of another car that looks as such. 

After some long considerations between the accord coupe, Toyota Solara and Acura RS-X, I purchased the Accord coupe. I paid 24,000 for it. This includes mudguards, fog lights, trunk trade, the security system, tax, and delivery charge. I think it was a great price. I have also added chrome tips to the exhaust. 

In my silver coupe, the interior is a dark gray. It is almost black. the leather is soft and it looks better in person then the photos. The driver seat is 8 way powered. It also comes with a manual lumbar support. I don�t leave it in its default position since it supports my lower back plenty. The passenger seat is not power. Which is great. It slides up much faster for rear entry. The driver seat would take a good 30 sec to slide forward. The headrests have holes in it for a great look. The back seats are very comfortable. I set the drive seat to my 6' comfort, and I move to the back and find there is ample of room. I still have 1 to 2 inches of room from my knees. The rear seats are very comfortable. (But me and my gf still have not broke in the rear seats yet, but I am sure it will be a bit cramp for that :) 
The climate control was great. I set it to 72. And it stays at that temp. There are 2 sensors in the car, one measure the amount of sunlight and another to measure the temp. These 2 sensors work together to modulate the cabin and match it to you climate control setting. It is also clearly display on the middle console. The six in dash cd changer is great. I load it up for hours of music. But the time left or the time for track is not display. I wish that it did. The buttons have a great feel. It feels much better than the Nissan�s. The position is just right. The Steering Wheel-Mounted Audio Controls are great. I can change the station on the radio and the cd tracks with the press of a button. It also allows me to control the volume with out lifting my hands off the wheel. I believe that the 6 speaker sound system is about 100 watts. But I dont know the exact wattage. The cd changer is a bit loud when it is switching discs. The mirrors are powered and the controls are right above the driver's window controls. I wish it had options for heated mirrors like the solara. 

Well, let me summarize it up: 
The car is very smooth. It pretty quiet. I didn't really try to step on it yet. But I am sure is fast enough for me. The silver paint is beautiful. The lights are bright. The leather is soft. 
The back seat is pretty roomy, although I would never sit back there. I am 6' and weight 190 but find it very roomy. The Transmission is smoother than my expectation. The climate control cools down the cabin in less than 2 minutes. I like the metal trim, which replaces the wood. The dash is well thought out. The engine is quiet. Not much road noise at 70 mph. 


I didn't like small opening of the sunroof. It should open wider. The trunk opening is too high. 

But other then that, it is almost perfect. 
I have done a lot of research and by far, this is the best car for the dollar.
