            Plain and simply stated, the GMC suburban is a fantastic truck. The keyword here is truck. If you are expecting anymore than that, explore other options. In a Suburban, you will sit high atop the road and literally cruise along the highways with good handling and a sense of safety. After all, about the only thing larger than you on the road has at least 6 more wheels under it. 

If you are looking for the finer things, bells and whistles that you would possibly expect with a 30K plus price tag to bring you, you won't find them in the Suburban. 

When the needle goes in the red, don't wait for a dash board warning light and think you have 30 miles to go, you will be calling triple A.If you are sure you have a lighter somewhere in the truck, mark it during the day because you will never find it in the dark at night. While your at it, mark the door and window control banks, I wonder whether the design team at GMC ever rode in a suburban after dark.

The simple little things are missing in this truck. A few more dash displays, and a dozen or so convenience lights would really make you feel better after writing that check for 30 - 40 thousand. <br><br>
