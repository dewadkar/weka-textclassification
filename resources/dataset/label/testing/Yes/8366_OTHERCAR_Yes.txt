                 My girlfriend recently bought a bright yellow 97 Firebird, let me tell you a few things about it... I have a 95 V6 Camaro and its both a joy and a pain in my side when she smokes me at the track.  Both of our cars are stock, but her car just has that much more get up and go to knock me back a whole .7 seconds... both are automatics... I first drove it when she suprised me at my house with this machine, it handles exceptionally well, i can feel the road just enough to know that im glued to it as long as i don't get too crazy with the car :) 
     Its quieter then my car mostly because it *had* the evil California emissions standards that my Camaro was lucky to be spared, but even without all the smog stuff, its pretty quiet... until you let your foot get away from your brain that is, then you can definately hear the roar that GM stuffed into the engine bay to make those Mustang lovers out there cower in fear.  Tearing down the dragstrip that first day just to see what this stock V6 had was a rush, I still remember seeing the times on the clock and wondering how her car was so much faster then mine, it had to be a v-chip that someone else stuck in the 'bird.  
     We then took it on a short road trip to see what it was like, theres not too much difference from my car other then the fact that the exaust is quieter, the suspension is pretty stiff so going around corners that normal people have to take at 45 was a breeze at 60-70mph.  Another test I did on her car was how well it responded in the 75-85 mph range, it gets up and still goes for an automatic to pass those truckers and slow moving trucks with trailers with no hesitation whatsoever, the only thing I really have to worry about when i drive her car is how well the radar detector is working... I got to test that out as well. 
     Anti-lock brakes are standard and when you need them the most, they're there waiting for you to step on them and slow you down just in the nick of time.  After scaring my loving girl half to death with some of the stuff i put her car thru, I slowly made it up her driveway to park it.  I'm not sure when the next time I will get to drive it, but believe me, I cannot wait :)
