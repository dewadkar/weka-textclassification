            Jimmy Buffett said it best ... �it�s a rag-top day ...�

Or, if you subscribe to the philosophies of the original Life�s Little Instruction Book, ... �everyone should own a convertible at least once in their life ...�

Both TRUE, TRUE, TRUE!

My little white Chrysler Sebring Convertible, with the camel drop top and camel leather interior, is a slice of heaven on earth.    The sun is a little brighter, the music is a little livelier, and life is a little better when you drop the top and cruise around town  (in fact, I think I might just be a little blonder in that car, too).

Of course, every trip (even just across town), finds friends, relatives and acquaintances all wanting to take MY car ... and, who can blame them (now, if I could just add a meter to collect gas money from my many passengers).    

As for the mechanical, practical and efficiency aspects of the vehicle, they all rate high as well.    The leg room (front and back) is amazing in such a compact car.    The engine purrs.   The gas mileage is fantastic (even with our current high pump prices).    It takes the curves with ease.    No maintenance problems in the year I�ve owned the car.     Every three months I just zip into the Valvoline Instant Oil Change for my regular maintenance and hit the road again in ten minutes flat.

Whether around town -- or across the country -- the ride is smooth and the looks of envy as you glide down the road are enough to let you know -- this WAS the perfect car purchase!
