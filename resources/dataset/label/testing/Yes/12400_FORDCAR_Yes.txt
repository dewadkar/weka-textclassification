            We traded in a Chevy Blazer for a 2001 Explorer right before the Firestone fiasco. It is the V-6 with AWD. It has all the features you could want, and we have not had a single problem with it. The leather interior is very comfortable, and drives much more refined than the Blazer. There is plenty of room in the back for the dogs and stuff for the kids. The tires are fine as well. I understand that the new explorer has a thurd row of seats and independent suspension which we will definitely look at when we trade in next yaer. I woish it used less gas. Even the V-6 seems to be a gas hog. We drove the V-8 and felt little difference other than noise, although if we towed the extra torque would come in handy. My wife feels safe in this vehicle and that is a great feature.
