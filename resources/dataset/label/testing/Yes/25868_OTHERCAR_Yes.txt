            I recently purchased a silver 2000 Jeep Cherokee. After months of trying to decide which SUV was good for me I ended up with the Jeep Cherokee. The ride you get when you are in this SUV is unbelievable. Although, it does feel like a truck, it is very comfortable, it manuvers very well, has a great deal of power and has tons of space.
 
There is nothing quiet like it in it's class. This SUV is a tough machine that can withstand all kinds of terrain. I used to own a Pontiac Sunfire and you can even compare the two. I would High Recommend this vehicle to anyone. 

The Cherokee comes in either the 2 door or the 4 door. It also comes in sport, classic and limited these are the same SUV they are just different option packages that come with the Cherokee. I have the sport and it comes with curse, tilt, and power everything. The classic and the limited are different mostly because of the outside. They have the same color bumper as the rest of the SUV. The sport has a black bumper front and back.

Overall I would recommend this SUV to anyone that is looking for a car with a lot of space, so serious power and a good look. ( I did hear that come next year the look of the sport, classic and limited will be changing)<br><br>
