            OK we are approahcing 190000 miles. Yeah it's still going like a pro. We bought our jeep in 1993 brand new. At first I didn't want to drive it I thought it was so big cause not many people had suv's then. Now I would not trade it for the world. 7 years old and still has almost all the orignial parts. Well of course not tires. But that comes along with the 190000 miles. I have had a few accidents in it and felt so safe to know that I or my child was not going to be smushed like a pancake. (of course the accidents were not my fault). If for some reason we decide to buy a new vechile with out a doubt in my mind we will bye another jeep. I have drove a few other suv's but my jeep is still my baby.  <br><br>
