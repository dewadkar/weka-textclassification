            I purchased (rather, leased) my 2000 Ford Mustang convertible nearly a year ago. It has given me pleasurable driving, as well as a good amount of attention. My particular model was custom ordered. The body is white and extra features include a white top, leather covered steering wheel, upgraded sound system, custom black stripe, rear spoiler and custom leather. 

I knew I wanted a convertible long before it was time to dispose of my previous auto. The warranty had expired and it was time to start shopping. I did some comparison shopping and found the Mustang to be the best buy for the money. Sticker plus tax and title was around $28k. Leasing turned out to be the better option for me, as I was sure I would grow out of my convertible phase and want something else after the 3 years were up.

I have enjoyed this car thoroughly. It handles well, and looks great. The zippy V6, 3.8 liter engine is quite quick, and I have no problem with acceleration or climbing hills. I was worried about the gas mileage, but I have found that is not really a concern. The highway mileage is much better, and average fill-up is once a week for $25. 

The convertible top itself is easy. Engage the parking brake and press a button. The noise level is not bad with the windows up, but when driving in true convertible fashion with all windows down, the wind can be quite loud. 

The upgraded stereo provided me with 4 extra speakers, which are handy when driving with the top down. I find the cd player to be much clearer than the radio and usually pop in a cd when driving with the top down.

I have had no mechanical problems, but a few warranty issues, which my dealer promptly fixed.  Overall, it has been a pleasure having this car.
