            Ever since I was young I have had a Dodge so it was an easy choice which Company I was going to buy from. What made me choose the Durango over a Jeep was the size I wanted a fairly big car so I could fit everything that needed to be fit into it, you never know what kind of situation you could come across. It also has great towing power and four wheel drive. I am always confident that it will be on the without slipping. It also has a lot of power and great styling and as I said it is perfect for any occasion especially if you have the third row removable seat. I hope you make the right chose and go with this subperb vechicle.<br><br>
