              This is an amazing car which will last without a problem for well over six years.  It has an above average gas mileage  of about 23 city 28 highway miles per gallon.  It is very nice to have a car which does not devour gasoline with today's soaring prices.  The suspension is very nice, creating a smooth, comfortable ride in some of the worst driving conditions.  It has an excellent amount of room for passengers in both the front and back seat and you can easily fit five people into the car.  I had this car for six years without a single problem, but now I must admit that it is starting to fall apart.<br><br>
