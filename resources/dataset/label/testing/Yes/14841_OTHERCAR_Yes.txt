            I just purchased my second Olds Bravada.  It is a new 2000 model.  Although I liked the first one, I find a lot of improvements on the new model.  One of the things I didn't like about the 98 model was the automatic climate control.  It seemed to blow bursts of air straight into my face.  The air flow seems to be more controlled in the newer model.  I purchased the vehicle because of its roominess.  I always have a car seat, stroller, and playpen in my automobile, and the sport utility makes doing that a lot more convenient.  I picked the Bravada over other models because it has a classier look.  I don't like the boxiness of some of the other models.  Also, I didn't want something that made me feel like I was driving a bus.  The Bravada is both fun to drive and roomy enough for everything I like to travel with.  One thing I did not know about the vehicle until after I bought it, is that a car seat can not be placed in the middle of the back seat.  It has to go on one of the sides.  This isn't a problem for me, but may be for someone with three children.  I have never attempted to use the Bravada as an off-road vehicle, but it provides a comfortable drive around town and on trips.  Personally, I enjoy this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone looking for a family vehicle.<br><br>
