            Our 2002 Prius just passed 1000 miles, and it�s proving itself as an ideal around town and commuter car. The �Super Ultra-Low� emissions were a selling point for us � setting a good eco-friendly example for the kids seemed like a good idea.  

On top of the federal tax savings, Colorado tax breaks combine to make the hybrid system cost essentially the same as a gas-only vehicle. Check for any savings where you live � your dealer can probably give good information. 

Delivery times have apparently improved tremendously. We gave our dealer some flexibility on the options, and he promised delivery in less than 30 days. We ordered on a Saturday, and took delivery the following Wednesday!

A few quibbles:
1. I prefer some sort of level indicator for measurements like voltage, temperature, and oil pressure. The Prius uses warning lights.
2. Indicator lights (e.g., cold engine, �CRUISE�) on the main display are not very bright; they are essentially invisible when driving on bright days while wearing sunglasses.
3. Cruise control loses its set speed if you tap the brakes (so �resume� doesn�t work). Instead, you must use �cancel� on the cruise control.
4. Cupholders (2 front and 2 rear) are sized for regular 12oz beverage cans; anything larger is inviting a spill. Pretty much useless for fast food large-sized cups.
5. Center storage bin lid is too low to serve as a usable armrest for taller drivers.

�For what it�s worth� comments:
1. Spend 30 minutes with the owner�s manual to test out and master the center panel controls.
2. Read the info on the anti-theft system � or it�s probably just a matter of time before you accidentally set it off.
3. The shift handle location is unusual, but operation is standard.
4. It takes experience to learn where the front end of the car is � I consistently have about 1 foot more room than expected.
5. Daytime running lights (a first for us) seem rather bright. It�s easy to head off in the dark without turning on headlights! Set the central monitor screen to dim when the headlights go on, and you�ll get a good reminder, though.
6. If you don�t get the CD (or navigation system), you get a concealed cubby in the center console the size of a computer CD-ROM drive.
7. The rear seats do not fold down.
8. The first time the gas engine shuts down at a traffic light, you�ll think that the car just stalled.
9. The brakes are �touchier� than most other cars, but it was a quick, easy adjustment for me.

Features that get appreciated even more with time:
1. Peppy, responsive engine.
2. Extremely tight turning radius.
3. Strong climate control system (including automatic mode to achieve a desired temperature setpoint).
4. Good sound system.
5. Superb fit/finish � inside and out.
6. Car feels solid.
7. Passenger room is surprisingly good � comfortable for our family of 2 adults and 3 elementary school-age kids.
8. Trunk holds more stuff than I expected.
9. Opening doors/trunk when car is wet does NOT drip water on occupants/interior.

I marked quality and craftsmanship a "5", but the level of quietness rates a "4". (To me, quality and craftsmanship are much more than simply ride quietness.) Roominess earned a "4", but I consider it unusually good for a compact car like this one ... probably deserves a "5" relative to other cars in its class.

We would not hesitate to buy this car again � it is truly fun to drive! (Note that we did NOT compare the Prius to the Honda Civic hybrid. I tend to steer clear of first-year car models.) The car seems well designed and engineered, with numerous clever touches. The Prius is our first Toyota � assuming that it ages well, it probably won�t be our last.
