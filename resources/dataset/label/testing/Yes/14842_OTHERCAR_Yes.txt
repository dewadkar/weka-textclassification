            We looked at everything on the market and choose our second (year 2000) Bravada.  The dealer incentive and trade in value cinched the deal for us.   We were seriously considering the Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited but were put off by the class action suit we read about at Edmunds.com in their section that allows posting by consumers.  Apparently, the gear shift noises and drive train whine has more than a few owners upset.
We noticed the *whine in our test drive of the Jeep and were told it was *normal :/
Another point to mention is that a 3 year old Bravada would be a good purchase as the used car market is flooded with vehicles coming off of leases (and fleets) at this time of year.
We got $20,000.00 on a trade-in for our PRISTINE 1997 Bravada (mileage of less than 24,000.
The new features offered of heated seats and mirrors, driver 1 and 2 seat memory set by the remote, theft alarm with panic button, stereo controls at the steering wheel AND most importantly (if you caught my prior review of our 97 Bravada) a NEW stronger, bigger condenser and a quieter blower fan with more adjustments for direction of air flow to improve the air conditioning capabilities (we sweltered in our black on black 1997 Bravada on 90 plus degree days.)
I enjoy driving the Bravada and that says a LOT considering I've been spoiled rotten by driving a foreign 5-series :)<br><br>
