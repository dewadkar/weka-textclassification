            I bought this camera in 2000 right before a 2 week trip to Australia/New Zealand. I still use it today, but am currently in the market for a new digital camera. It has been very reliable for 3 yrs. I have taken hundreds of pictures with it, with virtually no problems.

Very impressed with the image quality. While not jaw dropping, given the right conditions, the images more or less come out very sharp and clear, with good brightness and contrast. Check out some examples here: www.robpatti.com

As far as I know, this model was released just before Kodak came out with their EasyShare line of digital cameras.

Minor problems I had with it - the software for downloading the images to you computer was very buggy for maybe a year until Kodak released the Windows 2000 driver update. And even then, it was a hit and miss process of plugging in the USB cable, restarting the PC, and/or making sure the batteries had a full charge. Easy way around it - I would seriously recommend spending the $10 or $20 to get a Compact Flash card reader.

The LCD display is a little bit fuzzy. Sometimes it is difficult to tell if the image is good or not until you see it on the PC.  

Probably not sold retail anymore, but if your looking for a simple and reliable digital camera that takes good quality pictures and you aren't worried about printing pictures larger than 8 x 10, I highly recommend it. You can find this camera on eBay, or just wait a couple months and you can buy mine :-)
