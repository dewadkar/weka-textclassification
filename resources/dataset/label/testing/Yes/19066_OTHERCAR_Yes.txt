            Good bye Eastman Kodak. I bought a SmartMedia Card 64 Mg. The camera now holds a little over 600 pictures. The beauty is you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars developing pictures. You just pop the media card out of the camera, via the Reader/Writer, it shows you the pictures on the computer. You then can name them and print the ones you want. You save the pictures onto your computer and clear off the SmartMedia card. You can now reuse the card for another 600+ pictures. No more buying film and no more processing cost. You can send the pictures from your computer to anyone via email or onto a web site. The camera has a bunch of options and it acts like a telescopic lens. That means no more buying long lenses and lugging them around. The rugged 2020 can handle telescopic and micro items (like close up flowers). A fantastic bargain. Buy rechargeable NH batteries at any Radio Shack. I paid 4/$17.95. They last for hundreds of recharges. You will need to experiment with all of the features that are available to you. Retail price is $899 but the street price is now under $649.
