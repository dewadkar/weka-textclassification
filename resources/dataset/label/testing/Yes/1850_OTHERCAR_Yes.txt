            We bought our 1997 four door Grand Am when out other car died.  It was the first &quot;new&quot; car that my husband and I had ever owned.  What first attracted us to the car was the sporty look.  Other four door cars looked to much like old lady cars for our tastes.  The grand am was the perfect choice for us.  It was sporty but still had the family features that we liked including child locks on the windows and back doors.  These have been a lifesaver with a one and a half year old that like to try and roll down the window and throw his shoes out.  With this car that won't happen.
The car drives very nice.  It feels like you are driving a sports car.  It has a lot of get up and go and handles very nicely.  I would recommend this car to someone with one or two children.  There is simply not room for more. The only problem that we have had is that the alternator went out at about 45,000 miles.  This was expensive, but other than that the car has been great.  I love it!!<br><br>
