            I have had my Kia Sportage (a blue 1997 model) since September, 1997 and I couldn't be happier. A lot of people have said they have had major problems with their Sportages, and that has not applied to me. I have had a couple of minor problems (power windows needed a new controller, belts had to be replaced) but it was all warranty work. I didn't like the included stereo (AM/FM Cassette deck) and I have replaced it with an Alpine detachable-face CD player. The buttons on the standard stereo were very small and hard to get used to. The 4WD has never let me down, and I have driven my Kia through all sorts of bad weather. Just remember, that four wheel drive DOES NOT make you invincible! Too many people drive like maniacs in bad weather just because they have four wheel drive!

The Sportage is somewhat loud when you accelerate, but not unbearable. It is not really meant for speeds above 75 MPH. (Nor, should you be driving so fast!) I have taken it on long trips, driving 65-70 MPH with no problem. I do mostly local driving though and I just passed 20,000 miles.

Front seats are extremely roomy for even the biggest folks! I am 6' tall and BIG. Rear seats are a different story, slightly cramped depending on how far back the driver &amp; passenger sit. Good amount of cargo space for a small SUV. 

This is a great SUV for local driving, and light highway &amp; off-road driving. Remember, the Kia has a truck frame so you can go off-road with it. Aimed at the younger driving crowd, the Kia seems to be gaining popularity with first-time SUV owners of all ages, and it's sub-$20,000 price (nicely loaded) makes it even more attractive. Plus, my own experience shows 16-20 MPG driving locally (my Kia seems to run best on Sunoco &amp; Merit gasoline).
