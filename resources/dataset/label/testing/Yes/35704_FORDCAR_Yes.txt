            We purchased our Ford E 150 Econoline Van back in 1996. This van came with a Starcraft Conversion Package, which has added immeasurably to our enjoyment of this vehicle. It has a tv/vcr combo, track lighting, overhead lights, dual cassette, with separate speakers and controls for the back and leather seating. Little did we know when we purchased this van, the turn our lives would make, and how much we would actually use this for road trips. We probably take 12-15 road trips a year(some for only weekends), but this van has held up wonderfully.

Some of our pros for this van:
  This van is sooooo roomy! With 3 kids that pick at each other constantly, it's nice to have so much space between the captain's chairs. The back bench seat converts to a nice sized bed, that 2 kids can fit comfortably on. 
  With the conversion package, the kids are never bored, as we always take along a movie or two for long trips. We've also figured out how to hook up N64. Our van is the favorite for all the kids on the hockey team, too much to do!
  Also nice is dual controls for the air/heat system. 
  On the technical side, it's needed minimal work at this stage, 64,000 miles. All we've had done is a brake job, new shocks, and regular oil changes and tune ups. It rides extremely smoothly, as well.
  

Some of the cons for this van:
  It guzzles the gas! We estimate only 20 miles to the gallon, perhaps less. The engine is only a 6 cylinder, so there's not a lot of get up and go!
  This isn't the easiest vehicle to maneuver around small streets and into parking spaces. It often takes me 3 tries just to get into a space.(I'm sure you've seen me out there--I'm the one with the embarrassed kids!)
  On the cosmetic side, the armrests seem to have trouble staying in, the carpet is a bit reminiscent of the Brady Bunch (looks like a light shag), 
and we only got an AM/FM cassette stereo system. Would definitely go for a nice CD system.
  
This van is for you if:
  You like space, and need a great comfortable vehicle for travels.
This van is not for you if:
  You want speed and power, you don't like to spend $35 filling up a gas tank.
