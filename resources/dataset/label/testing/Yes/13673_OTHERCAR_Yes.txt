            There's a few really great, detailed write-ups on the Trooper in here, so I'll just add a little personal color.  I bought a 2000 back in June 2000.  I hadn't initially considered the Trooper, but was curious after checking out the Acura SLX (the former, heavily overpriced, feature-stingy rebranded Trooper).  I found I could get the equivalent of a $35k SLX for $32k from Isuzu.  Same car without the Acura logo on the grille.  

Anyway, the truck is fanstastic.  It is surprising quick for as large as it is.  It is light on its feet coming off a stop, and equally quick in the passing lane.  

It's handling is surprising agile as well.  It doesn't handle like my Miata, naturally, but for as big and tall as it is, it handles nicely. You'll also fine that the longer you drive it, the more comfortable you are with it and its 'range' is greater than you might first think.

I rented a Blazer recently on vacation and was extremely disappointed.  It was slow, cheaply made, cumbersome, and oddly had a surprisingly large turning radius.  I don't know conclusively if the Trooper's is smaller, but it feels smaller and is very manageable for a truck its size.

The interior is very nicely appointed.  The trinkets and extras are well placed, very functional, and you'll get as much as you would from a competitor for $5k or $10k more.

The only downsides are :
  1) The step up might be tough if you're less than 5' 6""
  2) Gas mileage is atrocious, esp. since it's a 6
  3) With the heat on, it seems to blast right on the driver's feet sometimes
  4) The safety catch that keeps the rear gate open while unloading prevents you from closing it one-handed.  Annoying for those huge grocery runs.
