            With our family growing, we needed a larger vehicle.  Initially, we decided that either the Odyssey or Sienna would fit our needs.  We looked at both, then the Quest, and decided that the Quest would be our best bet.  

Why did we buy it?  Well, it pretty much came down to price.  We wanted certain features - Remote Entry, CD Player, Alloy Wheels, plus all the standard power features.  The Odyssey EX priced out at $26,500, the Sienna LE with these features was $24,600 (2,000 less than msrp).  We were able to buy a Quest GXE with Comfort Plus package and CD Stereo for $20,600 (msrp $24,126).  Feature wise, it was on par with the Honda and Toyota.  In addition to the low price, we got a free video entertainment system, and discount 60 month/6.9% financing thru Nissan.  

We never considered the domestic vans, simply because their reliability doesn't compare with the foreign makes.

It drives well, good acceleration, very quiet.  However, when riding over large bumps, the body undulates a few times before settling down.  Kind of similar to a large luxury car.  The SE model has a sportier suspension which might be better in this regard.

The van rates 24 MPG on the highway, and on our first long trip, we averaged 24.6 MPG.  This was quite a pleasant surprise, since our old '98 Ford Windstar wouldn't get over 20 MPG.  We've averaged 21-22 mpg in mixed driving.

I wouldn't recommend this van if your family includes several teenagers, but with smaller children, this compact van is quite adequate.
