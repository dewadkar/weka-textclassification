            This is simply an excellent camera.  I considered several before purchasing, and the D-450 won out because of it's combination of low-light feature ability, optical zoom (3x), and image quality.  It is a perfect camera for my web site business, but it is not limited to on-screen viewing; with 1.3 megapixel resolution, I'm now looking for a new printer so I can really enjoy my photos.

The 4 quality levels (640x480 medium compression JPEG, 1280x960 high compression JPEG, 1280x960 low compression JPEG, and 1280x960 no compression TIFF) should be good for just about anybody.  Sometimes, though, I wish for a no-compression 640x480 setting.

The LCD is very good, and can be viewed from many angles, so it's great for showing a bunch of other people your pictures.  If you have a lot of people, no problem, just use the included video cable to hook it up to your TV.

Additional features include a panorama mode that &quot;stitches&quot; together several pictures and a sequence shooting mode that takes photos as long as the shutter button is depressed and there is room in the memory buffer.

The D-450 Zoom is an all around excellent camera and should please anybody who does not need the resolution of a 2+ megapixel camera.
