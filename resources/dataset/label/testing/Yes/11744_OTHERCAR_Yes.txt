            We were shopping specifically for a mini van.  We bought ours used because we simply couldn't afford a new one.  I was really wanting one with 2 sliding doors, but didn't think we could afford it.  We found one at my brother-in-law's car lot and I instantly fell in love with it.  We test drove it and it drives like a dream!  I hadn't owned a mini van in a long time and figured it would feel bulky to drive, boy was I wrong!  It drives like a car, smooth ride, smooth steering, etc.  It even had lots of cupholders which is something I had never had in any of the vehicles I had owned!  
It's very good on gas, around 28 mpg, I think is what we figured.  
We've been on vacation in it and it was sooo nice!  With two kids, there was loads of room for our 7 year old to spread out in the back seat with his books.  Still plenty of room for a cooler and all our luggage and then all of our souviners we brought back with us. We have had 7 people in it with no problems. The seats are very comfortable as well.
The main thing that sold me was the second sliding door.  With a baby, it was so convenient to put the car seat on the driver's side and be able to get out and open the door and get the baby out without having to go all the way around.  My older son loves it as well because he doesn't have to wait for me to get the baby out before he gets out, he can get out and come around to where I am (or getting in, whichever the case may be).  
The back seat comes out easily or folds down to haul large items.


I have to say this is probably the best vehicle I've ever owned!<br><br>
