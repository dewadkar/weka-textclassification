            Last year I purchased a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse from a Mitsubishi dealer.  I got an incredible deal on it because it had 200,000 miles.  The engine held out for only another 4,000 miles when it started staling out due to too much blow by on one of the cylinders.  I then purchased a used 2.0 non turbo engine at a junk yard (that was hard to find) and paid a mechanic to install the engine.  I had a new water pump, timing belt, and clutch put in at the time of installation.  I would recommend this preventive maintance because if the clutch goes out six months later your looking at a costly repair.  The only mistake my mechanic made was putting a used timing belt tensioner on that gave out after 30 miles.  Luckily it was on residential streets and not on the freeway or the engine would have blown the valves.  The engine jumped a notch on the timing belt causing the worst sound Ive ever heard on a engine.  We spent the 150.00 on a new timing belt tensioner and the engine seems O.K.  As far as room my wife is 5.2and loves the car but Im 6.0 and have to almost crawl out especially when Im in the passenger seat. (I dont like her driving anyway)  As far as body the car seems to have held up well against rust and cracks.  I think the car handles well on high speed turns and has always started in cold weather.  One other complaint I have had was the blower motor stopped working due to electrical.  Also the Interior lights stay on after the key is out.  These problems are hard to find and is I go right to the dealer instead of messing around with some idiot at a local garage.  Over all I would recommend the eclipse to my friend as a car that will last past long after you have paid it off<br><br>
