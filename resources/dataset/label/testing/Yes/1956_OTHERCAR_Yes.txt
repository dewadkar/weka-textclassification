            Now in the market for a new car, I have test driven many of them and have done a considerable amount of research on their problem areas and strong points.  The Nissan Maxima SE will be my next purchase.  What a car, what an engine.  The engine alone convinces the right side of your brain, and the rest of the car makes sure your left side listens to the right.  Plenty of room for a family, fast enough to beat teenagers off the line, comfortable enough for long trips, a large enough trunk for a golf excursion, luxurious enough to impress your friends, and a reliability record to die for.  

LOVES:
Did I mention the engine?  The interior styling is both functional and classy. (Note: I do not like the fake wood in the GLE.  Wood is for the Infinity I30, the Maxima's corporate twin, and dies not fit the rest of the interior)  The ride is near perfect:  Tight enough for cornering, soft enough for potholes.  The stereo is superb, a big improvement over previous Maxima's.
HATES:
The sifter is good, not great(Certainly not a Honda).  Exterior styling is &quot;interesting&quot;, though if you like it, this need not apply.  And now, the big whammy:  smoothly driving manual models (the only transmission choice to fully enjoy this engine) is very difficult because of a jumpy throttle and the inability to drop rpms smoothly from 2500 to idle.  this cause a &quot;bucking&quot; when using engine braking down a hill or when slowing for a light.  Depending on driving style, this may or may not be a big deal.

Driving this vehicle is a blast.  The engine pulls like a tractor from any rpm, and is so smooth I found myself forgetting to shift.  Other than the aforementioned &quot;bucking&quot;, driving this car makes you feel special.

This car is for any person who enjoys driving.  If you would rather drive than fly, here is your car.  (Takeoff might be possible with this engine if wings were included).  

WARNING: I highly suggest buying a Valentine One radar detector.  You don't notice speed in this car, and may be shocked to find ol'smokey behind with the lights flaring.
