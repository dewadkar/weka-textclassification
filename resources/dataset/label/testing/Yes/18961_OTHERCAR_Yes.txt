            Lexus GS 430

Lexus Luxury

I first saw the Lexus GS a few years ago.

One of my coworker who was my parking neighbor had just
bought a new one. That same day we went to lunch together, in his new Lexus. I was really impressed with his new automobile and asked him if I could drive it back to work after lunch. 

Let see how I feel about the 2002 Lexus GS 430 Sedan.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Lexus GS 430 has the silhouette of a classy automobile.  

I like the elongated shape it has instead of the ball shape most cars have these days.  

Two things bother me a bit. One is why put a rear spoiler on a luxury sedan? The other is the lack of chrome.

To me, putting a rear spoiler on such a vehicle is diminishing it class, it is as if the manufacturer is trying to attract two market at once, in this case it
would be the luxury market and the sporty market. 

With a car like the GS Lexus should have been content with the car as it stood and not adds a worthless decoration such as a rear spoiler.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

As for all other Lexus products, the inside cabin of the GS 430 is impeccable.

The quality of the leather used for the seats and the door panels is of a superior quality. The real wood grain used for the interior�s trim is also chosen from a select wood. The workmanship that puts it all together is excellent.  

In other words the GS interior is close to perfection.

For 2002 Lexus added in the GS 430 a leather-wrapped steering wheel which has controls for the sound system. 

They also added more wood trim than the 2000 model had plus a LCD display that provides visionary settings and touch control for the audio system and the climate control system.  

This makes the driver more alert to the road in front rather than looking around the dashboard for controls
and buttons.

Once you have taken place in the driver�s seat you know right away that you are in a luxury automobile. Every thing inside looks feels and smell class. 

The car I drove was equipped with an optional Mark Levinson eight speaker audio system. The sound coming out of these speakers can only be matched by the sound I was use to get in a Lincoln Town Car I once owned. 

The all around vision is excellent with the exception of the rear view that can be blocked by the spoiler. All the gages are easy to see and all the controls are within easy reach of the driver.

The exterior:

I like the shape of the GS 430, it ads a touch of class to this beautiful car. I think that this automobile would have looked much better without the spoiler and with a little chromed added.

The six-spoke alloyed wheels are fine. I feel that a the side-view mirrors should be a little wider, the GS is a fairly long car and wider exterior mirrors would help with the vision.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

This was only the second I drove a Lexus GS, I must admit that Lexus did improve the performance and the comfort of this automobile. 

Not that it badly needed so much improvement; I guess they are trying to stay one step ahead of the competition and they are succeeding.
