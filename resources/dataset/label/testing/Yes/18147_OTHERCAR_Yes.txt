            The Nissan Quest has been the best family vehicle our family has ever owned.  We have 3 children, a niece and a nephew who are always with us.  We fit the 2 babies in the bench seat in the middle of the van, and the other three children in the back bench seat.  We all fit in without feeling crowded.  This is perfect, as we hardley ever have to take a second vehicle.  The rear bench seat is easily removed, providing a large cargo space.  The first night we had the Quest, our washer went out.  It was a real conviencense to be able to go, pick out a washer, and then transport it home all in one evening.  When we took a  two family trip, we were able to take most all of the luggage, and souveniers in our vehicle as well as 2 of the children.  That combined with the handeling makes the Nissan Quest the Best Little Family vehicle we have ever owned.<br><br>
