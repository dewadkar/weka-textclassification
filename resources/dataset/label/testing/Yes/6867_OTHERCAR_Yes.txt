            Just to start out I'd like everyone to know that cars are not my bag. I prefer a pickup truck any day. But...  if I were forced to drive an economical, good bargain car, the Hyundai Elantra would be it. 

The model I drive most often seems at home on the road. The 2.0 4cyl, 140 horse engine provides excellent acceleration at any spot on the power curve. 

Gets Excellent gas mileage, about 25mpg in an average week.

Excellent interior construction and materials.

Excellent warranty 100,000 Bumper to bumper, only $1400 add on to sticker.
Standard Warranty is 75,000 Bumper to bumper.

Largest trunk I think I've ever seen on a car this size.

With a sticker price of about $10,500 this car is a bargain. 
And with the very extensive warranty, it makes the resale value of this car rise since your likely to get rid of it before the warranty expires. :)  <br><br>
