            I bought this camera for my husband for Christmas.  He hadn't even asked for one, but I thought he would enjoy having one (and ok, I wanted one).

So I really wasn't willing to spend over $150.00 in the off chance that we both decided we hated it.  We started using it the minute he opened it -- and we haven't stopped since!!!

It is so light there is no problem just sticking it in your purse or pocket anywhere you go.  Prior to us having this camera we took pictures maybe 5 times a year.....we take pictures about 5 times a week now!!!

We have an inventory of all of our household items for insurance purposes.  We have zillions of our friends, I may take a stab at starting my own webpage so my friends and family can see all the pictures we are taking.

With 8 megs of memory you can store alot of photos in it before you have to transfer.  And transferring pictures from the camera to my laptop is a snap since it uses an USB port.  Plug it in -- click -- whola!  You've Got Pictures!!!! (not to infringe on AOL's copy write of that -- LOL!) But the software Largan sent with this camera is great and again - easy to use.

If you are a novice to intermediate level digital camera user, I think this is a really good buy!  We are already looking for an upgrade for next Christmas -- maybe you will see my Camera on E-Bay!!  Ha ha!
