            Where do I start . . . in 1994 we bought our first minivan and it was a Pontiac Transport.  In 1998 we needed to upgrade and wanted to give a sport utility a try so we purchased a 1997 Ford Explorer .. MISTAKE.  Soooo, the hunt was on what would we get next.  We explored the Ford Expeditions and GM Tahoe and Yukon, but space was still going to be a factor in these vehicles.  With this in mind we once again found ourselves looking at minivans. The two choices we liked were the Chevy Venture and the Pontiac Montana.  While the interior of these two may be GM Branded, the exterior is NO comparison.  Like another epinioner mentioned, why spend that kind of $$ for a cheap looking vehicle which is how we felt about the venture. The exterior difference provides no comparison.  The Montana gives you all the sport appearance you could want in a minivan in a variety of options including monotone or two tone.  We chose the two tone option with the charcoal bottom. 

We visited two different dealers for test drives and just couldn't come up with the exact options we wanted.  Some things are important, however some things while they may be a luxury just aren't worth the extra expense.  Price was also important as we had a trade in that wasn't paid for.  Our priority choice in options were:  Color(not monotone), power door, rear heat and air, and captain seats in the middle section.  

We were crunched for time as we were needing a unit before our vacation so with a phone call to a larger dealer, the salesman mentioned the gmbuypower.com site.  With this site, you selected the vehicle you wanted and the zip code you were hunting in and it would then return a list of dealers in that area.  This saved us so much time.  You could actually view window stickers on most vehicles.  We found a dealer within a reasonable driving distance with the exact options we were looking for.  Having had a pontiac prior, we were familiar with many things so we were sure this is what we wanted.  

With the front wheel drive capabilities(traction control on some models) weather shouldn't pose a huge problem unless extremely severe.  Even with the lower priced version the van came with many bells and whistles to make an attractive package.  The power door is so handy when shopping or just for saving wear and tear on the door itself with people yanking on it.  And the safety features are great.  You can lock the door so it cannot be operated and if the vehicle is in drive the door WILL NOT open.  The other doors also unlock automatically when you put it in park which is also a nice touch.  Nothing is more irritating then kids yanking on door handles before you have a chance to unlock it because of the automatic locking system.  

If you are needing space and seating then this van is for you.  For seating options we wanted the 7 passenger unit with captain front and middle seats with the split bench for 3 in the rear.  Cloth interior, although many may argue for leather, was a must for us even with children.  We wanted a neutral color to help with the appearance. The captain chair recline for sleeping ability and the bench seat in the rear also adjusts backward for more comfort.  The extended version was also a must for us for the additional cargo room behind the rear seat.  There are cup holders for each row which is a nice touch for every age.  

One of the most important options for us and I would think for everyone was the rear heating and air.  Our prior minivan didn't have this and it was not good.  It's hard to believe that they even send them to a dealer without this.  The Montana has the ability to provide comfort to the front passengers and back passengers at the desired level.  

I have only had this van for a couple days, but I cannot stress enough the luxury of the way it rides and handles.  It has everything a person could want in a minivan and then some.  My son wanted the Montana Vision package but for $3000 I agree with another epinioner . . . I would want that in my HOME.  Going from a 4x4 sport utility to the Montana is really not even comparable, but I will take my Montana Minivan anyday over another SUV.  So for my frame of mind, the Pontiac Montana is the SUV of minivans.
