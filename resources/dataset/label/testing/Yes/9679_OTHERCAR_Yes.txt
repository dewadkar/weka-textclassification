            I bought my Neon as a &quot;used&quot; vehicle in 1998. It only had 8,000 miles and I got a great deal on it. I paid $8,300 for it and I think it was the best purchase I could have made with the money I had to spend. Even with 2 kids I still have plenty of room for the groceries. I love the fold down rear seat which is great for transporting something larger than the trunk allows. That was a creative solution for a compact car. The car handles nicely and is easy to park in tight spots. I really like my Neon and look forward to trading it in soon for a brand new one!<br><br>
