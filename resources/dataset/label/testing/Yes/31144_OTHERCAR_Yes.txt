            The Acura NSX if one of the most popular sport cars on the road today. The NSX is a fast sports car that acts like a race car. The NSX is also a car for style and luxury. The 2000 NSX is unchanged from last year's model but looks to me that their are minor changes. The NSX comes in 2 different models which are the NSX-T 2 Door coupe which I am doing and like better and the regular 2 Door coupe.

The standard engine for the NSX-T is a 6-cylinder, 3.2 liter, 290 horsepower engine. I think this is one of the most powerful engines in its class. The NSX has a RPM of 7100 which means Revolutions Per Minute. So when your on a straight away you always have enough power to outdrive your competitor. The engine is the same for the 2 door coupe too.

The NSX-T gets 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 miles per gallon on the highway which I think is pretty good for that kind of car. The NSX weighs 3,160 pounds and has an overall length of 174 inches. The NSX also seats 2 people in the front. The NSX is only has 2 seats in it and their very roomy but theirs no seats in the back. It has a cargo capacity of 5 cubic feet which is very small. The NSX goes for around 90,000 dollars.

I did not buy this vehicle yet but in the near future I will have one. I think the reason I like the NSX is because of it's power,looks,and I am very satisfied with Acura dealers and the company. The only thing that a dislike is the price of the NSX. 90,000 dollars is a very big amount of money. This is not a car that you can buy and then if you don't like it sell it in a year. If you buy the NSX you will have to keep to save money.

I have been in the NSX before and it rides so smooth and you can not even feel a bump. If you compared it to the BMW M5 I think it is a better car with a better engine though the M5 is a at a much better price. When you press on the gas pedal you will be amazed with the power of the NSX. I think the NSX is a vehicle for all ages because it is a fast sports car or it can be a luxury car too. It can also be one of those cars you only drive on Sunday but it has to be sunny out so it does not get dirty. I would recommend it for younger people because of the power of it. Also, when your riding it you will notice that when you pass by someone they will look at you and probably say &quot;I got to get me one of those.&quot;

I gave you many reasons why I like the car and how it feels but your the one that's driving it so go out and test drive the new NSX. I know you will be satisfied with its performance and luxury.
