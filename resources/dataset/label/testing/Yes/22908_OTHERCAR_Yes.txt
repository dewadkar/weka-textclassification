<TEXT>
            The first car I ever sold at my Nissan dealership was a 2003 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V model.  The couple was just starting out and had found themselves upside down in a used SUV and wanted a more compact car with better gas mileage.  I spoke to them over the phone and they made their way from Flagstaff down to Phoenix to find the car of what he believed was of &#147his dreams.&#148  He eventually was able to get just that after I hunted one down for him, plus he got a free sunroof to boot.

Nissan has geared their advertisement of the Sentra towards the female population because as records have shown in the past women are most likely to buy them.  The only exception to this is the SE-R Spec V model, which to many young boys out there is like a supped up model for speed drag racing.  All of a sudden the Sentra is no longer a &#147girly&#148 car as long as it is a Spec V model.  

<b>MODELS</b>
Anyways, the one pet peeve that I had about the Sentras were the different models as well packages that were offered on some and not on others.  It was one of my more challenging vehicles (as well as the Nissan Frontier) to learn as far as the statistics and keeping the models and packages straight.  So it was the last vehicle I chose to test drive in all the various models and the last vehicle I got certified in.  I am hoping not to complicate things in this review when it comes to models and details so please bear with me.  There are five models for the Sentra which are put it order from base to top end and they are as follows: the XE, GXE, 2.5 Limited Edition, SE-R and lastly the SE-R Spec V.  

<b>PRICE</b>
When I was looking at the sticker prices (MSRP) back in January the range was from $12K all the way up to $19K. Now depending on the model, the invoice on the Sentras range from about $11K to $16K.  As I looked through the Sunday paper though I found two ads that caught my eyes:  #1) Nissan Sentra 2003 for $9,484 and #2) Nissan Sentra GXE 2003 for $10,995, so I know that the automobile economy must be hurting a tad bit these days as they are basically trying to give away their 2003s to make room for the 2004s that are coming in.  As I have previously mentioned in other articles on the Murano and Altima, the dealership pays Nissan 5% of the sticker price for every day that car sits on their lot.  Now in order to make room for the newer models, this is about the time that they start making huge deals to get the 2003s (or any last years model no matter what year we are in) off the lot.  My guess is that these ads aren&#146t completely honest, as I have seen so many times in the past and you could probably get the base model for around $10,500 (maybe even less).

<b>DRIVE</b>
When I took out the base model (XE) I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable it was and for a base model, it didn&#146t drive half bad in rural driving.  For me it handled the turns as most Nissans do with ease.  I liked the way the steering wasn&#146t overly sensitive and the brakes were not too touchy either.  I did however find that when I took it out on the freeway at 65, the Sentra vibrated and the engine was noisier and I also found this to be true in the next step up of the GXE model.  Nevertheless, I then went back to the lot and picked up the GXE model.  Once again I discovered that the GXE responded well to the steering and the braking, which had the added option of ABS on this particular model, was great.  I tried my usual sudden stops and was pleased with the reaction of the GXE.  The other complaint I would have on these models is that they didn&#146t have much pep to them and didn&#146t climb up those highway ramps as quickly as I had hoped.  Moving onto the 2.5 Limited Edition, there is a reason why they are so (well to me) overpriced.  They are the more luxurious model of the Sentras, if you can picture a Sentra as luxurious in the first place.  It handled well and the same responses I mentioned above were there but even more noticeably better.  The tired gripped the road well as I made my curves and quick turns around the corners.  Moving onto the SE-R model, I wasn&#146t crazy for it, even it was moving up the ladder.  When I accelerated onto the highway ramp it pulled a bit and when I stopped suddenly it pulled again.  I just didn&#146t feel that it handled as well as the GXE or XE even if it is considered to be a step-up.  Lastly, we have that famous Spec V model that every young teenage boy craves.  Well first of all they are hard to come by, and secondly I they are a bit much for my taste.  I would never spend the money as well that they are priced at (can surpass the $20K mark if you aren&#146t careful and I sold one to a different customer that went over just as I said.  For that you mine as well start looking at the Altimas.  But I digress and get back to the Spec V model that I think was supposed to go from 0-60 in 7 or 8 seconds.  The Spec V model was not comfortable and I myself would never drive a car that has six gears (the 6 gears is a new feature as of this year).  It was bumpy compared to other models when I was driving it on the highway and on the side streets.  For all the Sentras that I had test driven and even sold, happened to be sticks.  I don&#146t think Nissan really worked hard on making the shifting smooth because for me it never was.  Maybe they will have improved that in their 2004 models.

<b>ENGINES</b>
The XE and GXE Models come with a 1.8 liter DOHC 16-valve 4 cylinder engine, which explains why the pick up and pep just wasn&#146t happening up those ramps.  The 2.5 Ltd., SE-R and SE-R Spec V all had a 2.5 liter DOHC 16-valve 4 cylinder engine.  As usual Nissan concentrated on the engine thoroughly using those lightweight components while skimming out in other areas that I will come when I hit on the interior of the Sentra.  The Sentra does come with the famous timing chain camshafts as well as the double platinum spark plugs which allows for that 105K first tune up.  Now on the XE and the GXE the engine has a Valve Control System that essentially helps measure things like the speed, rpm or throttle.  The 2.5 Ltd, SE-R and SE-R Spec V have a Continuously Variable Valve Timing Control System instead.  In order to give out the most advantageous performance, the intake valve timing is continuously varied.  On these models as well (the last three I mentioned) there is a free flow muffler with enhanced dual tail pipes as a standard feature and performance exhaust.  I think it is these little features that Nissan used to tempt the male population as well to the Sentras.  The Sentra is a front wheel drive vehicle also comes standard with that ECCS (electronic concentrated control system) that I have mentioned in previous articles.  If you are having car trouble for some reason with one of the major components, the Sentra will give you enough time to get to safety without blowing your engine.  As the Altima and Murano (see Former Articles) are on the famous liquid filled engine mounts, the Sentra is as well.  However, like I said previously, the ride doesn&#146t feel the same and I can still feel the vibrations and hear the engine noise which the mounts are supposed to prevent.

<b>DRIVETRAIN</b>
The Nissan Sentra is a front wheel drive which is standard on all models and is offered in an automatic on all models except for the Spec V which is manual and 6 gears.  However, the 2.5 Ltd edition only comes in as an automatic transmission.  The last tid bid on the Drivetrain Components is only applies to the Spec V and that is the Limited Slip Differential.  To the average that may not know what this means, it is going to evenly distribute power between the front wheels which greatly improves your traction control and grip on the road.

<b>SUSPENSION</b>
1)	Independent Strut Suspension: Standard on all models that as with the Altima and Murano is build with light weight machinery providing a smoother ride for the consumer.  However I still didn&#146t feel this &#147smooth ride&#148 in the XE and GXE when I revved up the engine and sprang onto the highway.  Both vehicles vibrated and created much noise for me.
2)	Multi-Link Beam Rear Suspension: Standard on all models as well, and is for enhanced steering and response while trying and I do say trying to keep down on the engine noise as you drive.  
3)	Front Strut Tower Brace:  The brace is only standard on the SE-R and Spec V and is not an option on the other models.  Basically it is going to give better response in steering and handling on rough surfaces or make a hard turn.
4)	Stabilizer Bars: Found all on models as standard
5)	Sport Tuned Suspension: You may get standard on the SE-R only and the Spec V has an even more special sport tuned suspension.
6)	Variable Rack and Pinion Steering: Standard on all models however the SE-R and the Spec V also include sport tuned steering as well.
It was easier to list all of these rather than present them in a paragraph when you have five models that the Sentra may come in.  I find the suspension is fair on all but you can definitely tell the difference in the SE-R and Spec V models.  

<b>BRAKES:</b>
The power assisted front disc/rear drum brakes are standard on the XE and GXE.  The four wheel disc brakes are standard on the three upper models.  The Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS) is not an option at all on the XE model, comes standard on the 2.5 Ltd Edition model, and is an option on the all the other three.  I find that on this vehicle it is necessary to have the ABS brakes.  I wouldn&#146t buy the XE just for the simple fact that it isn&#146t an offered option.  The braking system is much more enhanced with the ABS and makes a huge difference should you have to stop suddenly for a child running across the street.  I also noticed that as stated above, without the ABS, you can feel the Sentra pull to the left or right rather than just stopping in the direction you are heading in.

<b>WHEELS:</b>
A new feature this year was that the XE and GXE have come with 15 x 6.0 tires as standard.  The Aluminum alloy wheels come like this:
15 x 6.0	Standard on the 2.5 Ltd Ed
16 x 6.0	Standard on the SE-R 
17 x 7.0	Standard on the Spec V
It is my experience that the 17 x 7.0 is very important to those boys I was telling you about earlier.  When I was trying to sell a different model of the Sentra (since I didn&#146t have a Spec V on the lot) it was the tires that made the difference to him and he ended up getting the Spec V as that being one of his reasons.  Apparently the other sizes make the car look too, once again, &#147girly.&#148  The all season radial tires come standard on all models but the Spec V which has Summer Compound Tires.  The design of the tread is different on the summer comp tires and allows for better traction control for the driver.  

<b>CHASSIS</b>
The Sentra was not spared when it came to the body undercoating and once again out beating its competitors did the full job, not the half a$$ one where they don&#146t do it completely underneath.  This help in corrosion of the vehicle.  There are roof reinforcements for the compartment of the car so that you can feel safer in accident conditions as well as steel mechanisms.  

<b>EXTERIOR:</b>
The Sentra is as I was trained to have a an advanced aerodynamic body that helped with your fuel economy.  Now I will admit that if you look at the old Sentras that are &#147boxy&#148 they have upgraded quite a bit but I still don&#146t see them as being as sleep as the new Altima.  The famous halogen headlights with that have that crack resistant polycarbonate cover is standard on all models.  You can punch the headlights on this one too, but you may start hurting your knuckles if you go around punching all the different Nissan vehicles, point being it is standard on all their automobiles.  The car also comes with tinted glass as standard on all models, as well as the scratch resistant paint that helps with those small scrapes that occur from time to time.  It is optional only on the 2.5 Ltd and up that you may get a sunroof and the rear spoiler is standard on the SE-R and Spec V but an option on the GXE.  Oh and you can get fog lights on the Sentra as well on the GXE model as an option and it is standard on the SE-R and Spec V.

<b>INTERIOR:</b>
I always have to start off my interior characteristics with those bucket seats that I love and yes, it is standard on all models.  There are no models however that have a power assisted driver&#146s seat, they are all manual.  You&#146ve also got your front seat adjusters so as not to squish your boobs and being able to find your own style of comfort.  As for the plastic and that is what I would describe what they used for the dash and side panels, it is a bit cheap looking.  I think they put all their money into the engine and the other features and in order to keep the Sentra under the price of an Altima they went cheap on the interior panels and dash.  The back seat is 60/40 so you can put any long items that you might need, like skis, on your way up to the mountains.  There are different levels to seat trim, but honestly I am not going to bother putting them in because well &#147seat trim&#148 isn&#146t going to make or break your decision here.  It is standard on the 2.5 Ltd Ed and up that there is a leather wrapped steering wheel and you can option up for it on the GXE model.  You can even get that gear shifter that all your standard transmissions lovers adore in leather on the GXE but it is standard on the SE-R and Spec V and not offered on the other two.  

<b>COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE:</b>
I think they did well as far as the placement of the buttons and the rest of the comfort features which are standard as follows:
Armrest
Storage compartment
Front cup holders
Rear cup holders
12-volt power outlets.
There is a neat little center dash tray that I liked that can hold an small items and this is standard on all but the XE and the same goes for the map lights.  Believe it or not the XE does not have a lever to pull to release the trunk but all the other models do.  The XE also gets shorted with the Valet Key Lockout, Power Windows, Power door locks, and Remote keyless Entry.  The XE does however have the fuel release lever that comes with all the other models as well.  For the ladies out there, if you want to have lights on the visor mirrors it is only an option (so they make you pay extra for it, ugh) and you can&#146t get them at all with the XE.  The Vehicle Security System is only standard on the 2.5 and optional on the upper two models.  This system allows an alarm to sound if a thief was to try to steal your cylinders or open the lid or trunk without the right key.  There are warning lights for you people out there that forget about gas getting low or driving away with the power brake still on and wondering why your car is acting suddenly so sluggish.  Oh, one last thing, if you have friends that are tall and you yourself are tall you may find them not to be so comfy in your back seat on the way to the ball game.  When the seats in the front are pulled back to the maximum it leaves barely any leg room for the back.

<b>SAFETY</b>
The seat belt pretensioners and limiters that I have mentioned with the Altima come standard in the Sentra in all models.  Basically if you were to crash, there is a signal sent off to release and hold your seat belt in a way that could cause you later pain.  The driver and passenger can both feel safe with front air bags.  Side impact air bags are standard on the 2.5 Ltd Ed and only optional on all models, except you guessed it, the XE.  There are child safety door locks and the LATCH system with those Anchors and Tethers and the emergency trunk release when one of your children locks the other in the trunk.  Hey I have done it to my brother when I was little, but then again he force fed me a whole bag of radishes so he deserved it!  The accordion style crumple zones are found on all models and the steel beams that run diagonal from shoulder to foot.  As I have said, many other manufacturers only put this same steel beam straight across in your door frame causing other parts of you to be vulnerable in a t-bone accident.  
AUDIO
The AM/FM/CD is optional on XE and standard on GXE, coming with 4 speakers and a 100 watts with a digital clock.  The 2.5 and up come standard with AM/FM/CD,7 speakers with subwoofer, 180 watt and a clock as well.  You can get this in the GXE as well.  There is the Rockford Fosgate AM/FM/CD system that is optional on the SE-R and Spec V with 300 watt, 9 speakers with subwoofer and yes a clock too.  

<b>PACKAGES:</b>
XE option package
GXE Road Trip Package
GXE Road Hugging Package
GXE Synergy Package
SE-R Fanatic Package
Sunroof Package
Airbag and ABS Package

As I always say look at your packages with all items before you say yes.  Make sure you want all those items!  There could be one you like and four your won&#146t even think of using. So take the time to READ them thoroughly.

<b>WRAP UP:</b>
The Sentra is a great first, I have finally got my own vehicle type of car.  It is popular with the Spec V model with many young teenage boys who I personally think are out there street racing.  If I had to pick the model, I would go with GXE, not only because of the price but you can always add onto it as well.  It seems to be the best for the price out of all the vehicles.  I see some guys spend an arm  and a leg on the SE-R or Spec V model because when in high demand, you can always raise the price.  The gas mileage varies from model to model but on average gets 23 in city and 32 highway.

The Sentra handles fairly well, but if I wanted to get a little more out of Nissan, I would go the few extra bucks for a base Altima.  It is a nice first car to have and I can see why many women have purchased it, it is friendly to the shorter side of life.  However, I do think they are overpriced for what you are getting.  Maybe with those sale prices and rebates that are going on right now you can go out there and negotiate fair and square.  I certainly wish you the best and hopes that it helped you make a decision either way.

Until the next Nissan Report,
