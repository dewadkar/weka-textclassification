            Quite simply a great looking Italian car. I've owned it since July of 2001 and I still stare at her for a minute or so after I park it. There is just no other car on the road that looks or drives like the 164.

This car is not for just anybody though. There are some idiosyncrasies that the potential buyer needs to be aware of. This model alfa, because of the space that the 6 cylinder takes up under the hood, has a very wide turning radius. Also the brake pedal, even though I've replaced every just about every single part of the braking system, needs to be pressed with some authority. The car stops on a dime, you just can't be afraid to hit them brakes hard when needed. My mechanic, who owns a 164 L and also races Alfa's along with his two brothers in their spare time, tells me that all 164's stop that way. On to the money part now...I have spent over $7,000.00 maintaining it. My baby's gotten a valve job, timing belt, plugs, wires, new transmission, new fuel pump, had the A/C converted over to the new type that accepts the freon that's currently on the market, engine mounts, brakes, rotors, alternator, power window regulator, and some miscellaneous electrical work. The person I bought it from for $4,000.00 had receipts totaling $6,500.00 worth of work that he put in the car also!! I must really love this car. 

I consider the money I've put into repairs as an investment in my happiness and as money well spent. As a result of taking care of my baby, she is very tight and extremely quiet. No rattles, squeaks or shakes. She actually runs on the cool side, most times at under 175 degrees!

The car is incredible though. It has so many luxury features and so much leather. Some examples are front and rear fog lights, electric sun roof, lighted door panels, front and rear heated seats, leather all around, ABS, A/C, driver's side airbag, 183 HP, 6 cyl, the unmistakable growl of the alfa engine, and enough buttons on the dash to launch a satellite into space.
 
There is no feeling quite like driving this baby.
It's nice to know that your one of the elite few that drives in an Italian luxury/sport car. It's great to be an "alfista".
