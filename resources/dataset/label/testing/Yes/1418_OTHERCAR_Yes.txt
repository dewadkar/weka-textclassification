                  I remember the first time I saw a Neon. I laughed. I thought it looked like one of those cars in the Chevron commercial that was always talking about Techron and evading the birds. Well I guess I should have bit my lip.
      About a year and a half later I was in need of a new car. I didn't have a whole lot of money at the time and I just HAD TO HAVE a brand new car. I just turned 18 and was barely making about $1200 a month. But I was willing to fork most of it over just to have a new car. Well since my options were so limited and no one seemed to want to give me a car I ended up at the Dodge dealership in front of a 1998 Dodge Neon R/T. It wasn't like any other Neon I have ever seen. It was the beautiful Viper blue with 2 silver stripes across the top. The interior wasn't the usually rainbow confetti like material. It had 150 stock horse-power, which was about 20 or 30 more then the sport model. I thought since I had never seen the R/T before I would surely have a unique vehicle.
      Needless to say I was approved for the first time buyers program which made it impossible for me to walk away. Might I also ad the fact that I had not driven a 5 speed before and this car only came in a 5 speed. My first lesson was driving it off the dealership 2 days later. I still killed it a few times, but I found that this car drove so well. It almost shifts for you. I've heard that a lot of people have had nothing but trouble with these vehicles, but that is not my experience. The only problem I encountered was the sun roof broke at one point. The Dodge dealership known for their 5 star service was amazing with their appointments with me. I was always able to get my car serviced in a timely manner.
      I did a few mods to my car, but sold it before I really got into it. I would have kept it but I had really used the car for commuting reasons and had put over 60,000 miles on it in less then 2 years. I didn't want to put too many more miles on it for fear of trying to sell it at a later date so I traded it in. I now have a Mitsubishi eclipse, the car of my dreams, but have found that I would trade it back for the Neon again if I had the chance. Oh well you live and learn. I just wanted to give Dodge a thumbs up for this vehicle. Although put down by a lot of people, it is a good car for someone who is just starting out and doesn't have a lot of money to spend. I had a lot of fun times in that car and will miss it.<br><br>
