            I originally wanted a Corvette for my dream car, but my leasing agent told me about the Pontiac Firebird with Ram Air.  I couldn't be happier with his advice. The Firebird has almost as much horsepower but costs less and has more room.  The car gets second glances everywhere I go and of course is fun to drive.
  The seats are comfortable and the instrument panel is very impressive especially at night with the orange back-lighting.  The manual 6-speed transmission is the way to go with this car.  Just going to work every day is a thrill.  There is so much power in the first three gears that it is hard to believe the Firebird is a street car.  Everyone will want to challenge you at red lights, but there is no point in even trying since very few cars would stand a chance off the line!!
  There are some negatives but they are minor.  A large person may have difficulty getting in and out of this car with the seat configuration.  The doors also open very wide which can be trouble in tight parking spots.  Braking ability is also below average especially during wet weather.
  Overall, however, the Firebird meets all expectations and more for a bargain price.  The 2000 model may be the last of it's kind so do not hesitate.<br><br>
