            If you have a fairly low mileage Neon using oil (You should check every few weeks!!) chances are it is a defective Head Gasket.  This is a frequent problem with the 2.0 engine.  I bought a 1997 Neon in late January of 1997 after my 1994 Sundance was totalled in an accident.  It has been a fine car for the money requiring only normal maintenance until a Head Gasket problem surfaced after 35,200 miles, and two months AFTER the Warranty expired.  I was quoted $900 for repair by the Dealer, since the job is very labor intensive.  That's the BAD News.

The GOOD news is that I took it to a Wisconsin mechanic knowing the labor
costs would be cheaper, and he told me Chrysler should be taking care of it even though Warranty had expired.  I found this Site and learned a lot about Head Gaskets, and also found the Phone Number (1-800-992-1997) to call Chrysler Customer Service.  After relating my tale of woe they called my Dealer back to set up an appointment, and happily have repaired the car at no charge.  Note that Ford also had gasket problems with their 1997's and have done a recall.  So even if you've paid for Head Gasket repair there is a good chance Chrysler will reimburse you if you less than 50,000 miles on the car.  Just call and be persistent!!<br><br>
