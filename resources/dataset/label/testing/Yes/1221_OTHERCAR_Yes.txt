            I recently purchased a 93 Mr2 turbo for nearly 1/2 the cost!!! And I simply love this car. Just at the first glimpse you automatically know this car hauls. The handling is very tight and seems to hug the road around the tight corners. Every time I take it out I get &quot;what kind of car is that , Nice car and want to race?&quot; This is literally a super 4 cylinder. I have raced and beaten( legally of course) 300zx's mustangs,
many civic's and many more. I have to date put on many mod's on the car such as intake, exhaust,sound system,rims, gauges and many more. I would seriously recommend this to any one who is looking for a fun to drive sports or performance car.The only thing that I have a problem with is getting out.<br><br>
