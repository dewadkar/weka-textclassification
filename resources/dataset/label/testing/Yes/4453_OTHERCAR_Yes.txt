            Love the Cabrio.  I recently leased a new dark green cabrio with black leather interior, heated seats, cd player, and I am in love with it.  It is like an extension of my body.  Im obsessed with it.  It rides very nicely and I get tons of compliments.  I even drive with the top down when its cold outside!  The heating and airconditioner works really well and heats up in like 10 seconds practically.  The sound is good too witht he stereo.  My favorite part about it is the steering wheel for some reason.  Its nice and little and cicular, obviously, but its just so cute I can't stand it!  It smells nice, and the seats are SO comfortable.<br><br>
