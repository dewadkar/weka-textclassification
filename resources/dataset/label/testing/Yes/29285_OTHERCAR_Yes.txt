            As a former employee to a Chevrolet dealership.  I of all people should know the look, the feel, and the drive of the Camaro is the whole reason why the camaro has been the number one selling Chevy car in Northern California.  I've never had the experience of owning one but i definitly would like to.  Working in a car dealership environment i must say that camaro's are very flexible cars. You have the teenagers buying the V6 cheaper &quot;slower&quot; models and the mid life crisis middle aged men buying the Z-28's or Super Sports.  

       I definitely saw my share of people buying this extrordinary vehicle.  What i like most about these vehicles is the look and drive.  The look of the camaro gives off a sleek, fast feeling at just a glance while the drive of these powerful cars is smooth and fast.  

       This car is definitely for a variety of people looking for something fun and sporty.  Let me just warn everyone now though, Camaros will not be made anymore after 2000.  We were told this at our dealership and we were also told 2001 so lets just cross our fingers and see what happens. All i have to say is the camaro is a legend and i suggest everyone stop in at a dealership and just take a test drive. i assure you that you wont regret it.<br><br>
