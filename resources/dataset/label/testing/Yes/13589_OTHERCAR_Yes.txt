               I love cars. In fact... cars are my life. Needless to say, when I went hunting for my first sports car, I wanted a car that offered plenty of power and performance,as well as head turning appeal, while not sacrificing comfort, and remaining in my price range.
   What was my decision? The Mazda Miata. I purchased a 1996 model, in a beautiful pearlescent ocean color that Mazda eloquently dubs &quot;Montego Blue&quot;. It came equipped with virtually every factory option, and has so far been an impeccable car.
   A very comfortable car, the Miata wraps you in its bucket seats as soon as you sit in, and your driving position is perfect, with good view of all controls. Ergonomics are better than average... nothing is a far reach away. The premium audio system includes one of the neatest innovations I have seen in a convertible: Speakers built into the headrests, which can be turned on and off. These are useful when the top is down, so no sound quality is sacrificed to wind noise. There are, however, some restrictions to the Miata's driver. For instance, if you are over six feet tall, you won't find the interior very acommodating. It is, clearly, a car built for the Japanese person, and is not inviting to those with longer legs. 
   The engine of the Miata deserves credit... it is the one thing in the Car that has been free from any doubts. A smooth 1.8 liter four cylinder, it's 116 hp is plenty enough to send the car down the highway at ghastly speeds that I won't even say here (no tickets yet!). Its handling is razor-sharp; the car can turn on a dime, and according to Road and Track magazine, can handle a slalom course at speeds higher than those of a Dodge Viper RT/10! It's true, the doubts I had about the Miata as a Sports Car were quickly relinquished at one drive. Though my car came with a nice five speed Automatic (with hold function), I would recommend the slick shifting five-speed manual for you purist drivers out there... I here great things about it. I get great mileage, too. I've had about 25 miles to the gallon... quite a difference from the 15 in my Isuzu Trooper. 
   As a convertible, the Miata is everything you could ask for. The speakers in the seats have been a great thing to have, especially at higher speeds, and the car offers a back-to-basics open air experience that few get to feel in these days of BMW and Jaguar Luxo-vertibles. And the price can't be beat... especially for a high quality used example.
   I have, however, found a few tedious flaws in the car. Being so low to the ground, it's gaping oval radiator grill is prone to blows from many airborne pieces of road-litter. Rocks and bugs in particular have proved enemies for the car. For this I would recommend installing both a grill protector (almost invisible) and a nose mask (&quot;bra&quot;) to keep your car pristine. Also, I would recommend buying a hard top. The soft top doesn't retain heat well in winter, and has substantially more wind noise. Besides, the hard top is great looking, and the glass rear window is a plus. Then there is the trunk. Most space dominated by the Spare tire, you are provided with very little storage space. No long trips, and no golfing... but then again, you can always send luggage Fed-Ex, right? 
   As for the interior, I was disappointed with the absence of power locks. As pitiful as I may sound... manual locks become a nuisance... especially when you can't lock the door when it's open. And the horn controls are hard to find spontaneously. I try to press the center of the steering wheel, and nothing happens... when I remember that the horn is triggered by the two small buttons that seem to hide at the sides of the wheel. But don't worry, you'll be embarassed to use the horn anyway... it sounds like one I had on my bike when I was a kid (definitely Japanese...). However, the most mysterious cabin problem is the placement of the map light. It is situated on the passenger side, almost below the glove box. I sure wouldn't want to have to bend down to read my map, but the light will prove useful for those of you who like to admire your feet while driving at night. Speaking of night, some may not take liking to the pop-up head lights (changed to fixed lamps in '99), but I love them. And there's always the wind noise, but hey, isn't that what a convertible's all about?
   True, there are a few things I would change about my Miata. But none of them are big enough to detract from the joy I get from driving it. The Miata is a sporty, affordable alternative to its European competitors, and hey... it IS the one that started the fad...
