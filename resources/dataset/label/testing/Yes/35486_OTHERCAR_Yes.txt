            1999 was the first model year for this big van and Honda  did it right the first time. Our Odyssey did not need any repairs at all in 4 years and 50,000 miles. 

Comfort and safety: 
+Four comfortable captain seats with good height, recline feature, arm rests and lumbar support can't be beat especially on long trips.
+Rear bench folds into the floor. With the 2nd row removed the space can be used to move a kitchen stove or two can camp (just open a few windows a crack for air).
+Rear bench is off the floor so long object like skis can be easily transported inside with all seats up.
+Air conditioning and heating are both powerful. There are rear outlets and controls for both.
+Headroom is plentiful unless you are an NBL player.
+The possibility of a whiplash in an accident is greatly reduced by adjustable headrest on every seat.
+There is a greater distance between the rear bench seat and the rear door than in other vans which makes it safer in a rear end collision. 
+This van has one of the widest tracks and the lowest center of gravity making it more resistant to rollover.
+4wheel antilock brakes work well. Even with only the driver in the car none of the wheels will lock up and skid during a hard stop.
+Portable TV can be placed on the floor for the kids (plug TV in the front socket and game console in the rear socket). 
-Long legged people may find seats a bit short.

Driving:
+There is plenty of power for all the usual driving situations.
+4 speed transmission with a lockup converter is smooth.
+/-The Odyssey is one of the lowest vans which makes it stable and easy to get in and out of but it also has to haul up to 7 people. This translates to a fairly short suspension travel which in turn means hard springs. The result is a busy ride. The smoothing factors are the heavy weight of the van and the independent rear suspension.
+Wide track and low C of G make for better stability in turns.
-Parking in tighter situations takes more time than parking a car.
-Extra care is required during lane changes due to a large door post partially obstructing drivers view to rear left.

Other:
+All aluminum engine warms up quickly even in cold weather.
+Transmission has a drain plug making fluid changes a snap.
+LX model has steel rims which survive winter salt and tire changing machines better than cast aluminum rims.
+Body panels are galvanized making them more corrosion resistant.
+Tall final gear and lock up converter make the engine turn slow which means less noise and good fuel economy on trips.
-Don't let the kids pull on the door handles too hard, they will break.
-1999 Odyssey has a timing belt that has to be changed every 96,000 km. The belt makes the engine quiet but it is  expensive to replace. Later models use nosier but more durable chain.
-1999 Odyssey has had two recalls: on a wiring harness under the hood near some a/c plumbing and on ignition wire gauge. Have it checked.
-Sliding doors may stick in the summer and freeze up in the winter, silicon spray on the seals helps.
-Low clearance may be a problem on boat launching ramps and very rough country roads.
