            I recently test drove the LEXUS RX3OO.  This vehicle is a turn on your average Sport Utility Vehicle.  Normally, when in the market for a SUV, you don�t find one in the luxury category.  Yet, it seems as if the Luxury SUV is becoming a trend.  Still, most people are used to seeing the Explorers, and Blazers, etc.
The RX300 is basically a Blazer, just slap on the premium leather interior, some gold trim, and a premium sound system��and there you have it.  Yet, it still seemed to be more to it.  It seems to have a smoother ride and handling.  Also, I noticed that in an explorer, you really have to push down on the gas to make it go, that is not the case with the RX300, which is available in a finely tuned, V6 or V8.  It handled well in bad weather conditions, as well as normal ones, and I�m sure I could handle a little off-roading�..not that anyone would take their LEXUS out into the desert through rocks and waterfalls!!!!!
So, if you have the cash, and your looking for a nice ride�..check out your nearest LEXUS dealership
