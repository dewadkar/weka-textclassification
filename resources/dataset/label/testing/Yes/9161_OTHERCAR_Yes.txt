<TEXT>
            My father-in-law just recently bought a 2000 Toyota RAV4.  I have ridden in it a few times and actually driven it a couple of times.  Here is what I have found in my short experience:

<b>Size</b>
The Toyota RAV4 is too small for me.  I feel like I am driving a miniature vehicle.  It is very narrow.  In fact, we went to play golf and I had a hard time getting my golf bag into the back of the vehicle because the bag was too long.  The back seat is plenty wide enough for two, but I wouldn't want to sit back there with two other people.

<b>Options</b>
I did enjoy the little extras that this vehicle had on it.  It has all of the standard stuff like power everything, A/C, Cruise Control, etc.  It also has some little extras like a console that was specially put in that holds CDs, tapes, change, and just about anything else you can think of to put in a console.  It also has a very good heat and air system.  For most SUVs, it takes a while to get the inside cool in the summer.  Not in this SUV.  It cools off by the time you get out of the driveway.

<b>Durability</b>
Like I said earlier, I felt like I was driving a miniature vehicle when behind the wheel of the Toyota RAV4.  I don't feel very safe when I am driving it because it is pretty light weight for an SUV.  I feel like I am going to be blown off the road by a swift wind.  The body is made of fiberglass and metal.  It just doesn't seem to be very strong.

<b>Recommendations</b>
I would recommend it to someone who does not have a lot of people to carry around.  I would also recommend this to anyone who would just like a little more storage space than you get in a typical car trunk.  I would also recommend this to anyone who is going to do a lot of driving.  The gas mileage is better than most other SUVs.  

I would not recommend this vehicle to someone, like me, who has two kids in car seats.  This would make the back seat very tight...similar to the car I have, the Nissan Altima.  I also would not recommend this SUV to someone who is wanting a work horse SUV.  It doesn't have a lot of power and, therefore, can't tow much.

<b>Overall</b>
Overall, this is not a bad vehicle.  It gets my father-in-law where he wants to go and does what he wants it to do.  It just doesn't have enough room or power for me. <br><br>
