            Last weekend when I traveled with my children to Louisiana, I had to rent a car to drive into Baton Rouge because we had to fly into New Orleans on our flight.  Because I wanted something comfortable as well as reliable to drive, I chose to lease the <b>2001 Buick Century Sedan</b>.

The <b>Buick Century Sedan</b> is a very comfortable six passenger vehicle which is roomy, very quiet, and very easy to drive.  Having felt hesitation with many vehicles that I have driven I seemed to feel quite at home behind the wheel of this midsized car.  

The model which I drove had a 3.1L V6 engine and 4 Speed Automatic Transmission.  In addition to a very basic AM/FM/Cassette radio, the Century had an absolutely great air conditioning which had dual controls for both the driver's side of the vehicle as well as the passenger's side.  

Traveling from New Orleans to Baton Rouge was really rather easy and fun.  The car handled very well and had great pickup.  My youngest son who was sitting in the back was really quiet almost all of the time that we were in the car and enjoyed the ride.  I enjoyed the fact that I could have a conversation with him while we were going down the Interstate because I've found that in many vehicles that it is not possible to have conversations from the back seat to the driver in many cars.  

Averaging about 24 miles per gallon on the road we made the drive from New Orleans to Baton Rouge without incident and afterwards I took the car further north of that area to visit friends and family.  Again, I felt very confident behind the wheel of this vehicle even avoiding a serious accident which occured on the Interstate within the Baton Rouge Metro area.  

Parking was not a problem as well.  I was able to judge distance better in the 2001 Century than I am in my 2001 Chevrolet Impala.  I was also able to drive this vehicle down a long country road without much lighting and no shoulder without feeling fearful that I would fall off of the side of the road and have an accident.  

The trunk room is also phenomenal and I was able to pack very large bags into the back of the vehicle as well as pack groceries that I had bought from Baton Rouge to be shipped back here to Georgia.

There were only a few things that I really didn't like about this car which will seem very minor.  One thing is that the steering wheel was rather narrow for this size of a vehicle.  I felt sometimes that my grip on the wheel was not really &quot;right&quot; and had to readjust it several times.  The other is that even though the turn signal / light / cruise control bar had an indication of the cruise control feature there were no settings on the steering wheel as I have in my 2000 Chevy Impala to adjust the settings of the cruise control.  I don't know if this feature was activated within this certain Century which I had rented, but if it was not a feature of the car, I would have thought that perhaps GM would have installed a different type of control bar on this vehicle to show that it did not have a cruise control feature.

Overall, I am very pleased with my driving experience with the <b>2001 Buick Century</b>.  I would have had no problem taking the car and driving it all the way home as my own.  It's a very comfortable, smooth, quiet, and reliable vehicle in my personal opinion and I highly recommend it for purchase.<br><br>
