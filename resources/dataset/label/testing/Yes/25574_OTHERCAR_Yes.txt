            Who says money (and a great-looking sports car) can't buy love?  It can, especially when the token of affection is a brand-new BMW Z3 in lipstick red.

Forget specs here.  Anyone familiar with the Z3 knows that back in the late 90s (and even now), the convertible was (and is) famed more for its sleek design than technical prowess.  And that is exactly why I love it.
In its basic, most &quot;pure&quot; form, of 1.9 liter, 4 cylinder, all standard features w/out any options, the Z3 is a sheer delight to drive simply because it looks fabulous and takes you away from reality while you're in it. 

Having the choice of a more powerful engine, wood burl trim, fancier wheels, etcetera, etcetera, I opted for the classic chassis, 5-speed without any frills.  I wanted a car in which I can feel part of the road, with sound and wind accompanying me, not the most recent pop artist blasting on a local radio station on the back of my chair.  

Who needs real acceleration power when you drive in the cloistered regions of the United States?  Especially in a convertible?  In my opinion, US roadways (at least in the suburbs) just don't allow for fast driving.  So buying a convertible was more for vanity here than for Macho Drivers 101. Give me the Autobahn and I'd want a Porsche.  Give me curvy little roads winding around strip malls, and I'll take the BMW.  It's the perfect package of form and function at the right price.  

Apparently my adoring husband noted these desires.  On our 5th-year weddding anniversary, the wonderful guy surprised me with a shiny new Z3 in lipstick red. Gotta admit, I feel like a real Bond Girl in it with my long hair blowing in the wind (really blowing because he failed to purchase the wind barrier that attaches behind the seats). And though I don't feel totally safe when I'm surrounded by 18-wheelers on the highway, the world is definitely enough when I'm tooling around those curvy tree- lined streets with nothing but open sky and sunshine.<br><br>
