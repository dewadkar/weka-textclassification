            These cars are EVERYWHERE in New England.  We have a 1999 Forester S with almost all of the options.  Heated leather seats, 4 wheel disc brakes, tilt, cruise, etc.  We bought the car with 32,000 miles on it, so it was still under the 36,000 mile factory warranty.  The rear brakes barely worked, so I went to a Subaru dealership, and they advised me that we needed new rear rotors.  At 32k!?!?!?  I asked if it was covered, and they said that it was "normal wear and tear".  I've never owned a vehicle that needed rotors at 32k, so I was pretty upset that I had to spend over $350 for new rear brakes.  I also had to replace the tires at 32k, and that was a surprise too.  The car is great in the snow, which we have plenty of here in central Massachusetts.  We have an 8 month old son, and his rear facing car seat barely fits in the back seat.  I'm 6'2", so I have to put the drivers seat all the way back, and it hits his seat.  Not much room back there.  Transmission shifts hard when the car is cold, as I've seen mentioned here before.  I get about 25mpg on my daily 100 mile round trip commute.  Not bad for AWD.  Overall I love my little Sooby, and it hold up well against our Ford Explorer in all respects, except for cargo space.  ENJOY!
