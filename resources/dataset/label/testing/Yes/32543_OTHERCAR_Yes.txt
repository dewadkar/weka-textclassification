            This car is the only automobile I totally trust to get me to anywhere from anywhere. I needed a car that was good on gas and with a reputation for being long lasting. I drive a total of 120 miles daily to work and back,so first I knew I had to have a car that would not eat my weeks pay for gas and with the promise to get me to work and back home safely. I researched foreign cars,American cars and cars that used both parts in the makeup. The Saturn coupe was all this and more. The gas mileage is easily 28/30 miles per gallon,the comfort is...just that..comfortable. The warranty is great. You can usually tell how dependable a car is by the backup of its manufacturer. And Saturn stands behind all parts. And as a single female..that does it for me!!<br><br>
