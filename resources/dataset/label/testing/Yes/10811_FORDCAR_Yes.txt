            I am the proud owner of a 1998 Ford Windstar mini-van. When my wife and I were researching the right vehicle to accommodate our growing family of Five, the Ford Windstar was the only mini-van that had everything we were looking for.

We insisted on safety, and that was our #1 priority. We couldn't have been more pleased to find the Windstar had received Five stars***** in  crash testing for safety; and is the only mini-van to have this honor.

Roomy and spacious was next on our list. A vehicle that would have plenty of leg room, and room between the back bench seats for the children to be comfortable. The mini-van also seats seven (7), even better; just in case we decide to expand our family!

A vehicle that would ride smoothly and get good gas mileage for those family vacations.

A reliable vehicle was a must, as well as one with extra space for the needed luggage on trips or the casual trip to the store.

We also wanted air/heat in the front and rear, so the children would be as comfortable as possible; very important.

The Ford Winstar has it all!! One of the great things about this mini-van is the 3rd bench seat can be folded down for extra storage or completely taken out if so desired. Long distance trips are an &quot;absolute joy&quot; in our van. Just put on the cruise and sail away. The extra space between us, in the front seat, extended to where the children are in the back; is a great relief for those long trips when they so enjoy singing away, but you don't have to hear it right in your ear. They have enough room to stretch and sleep comfortably, as so does my wife in the front passenger seat when reclined. (How I would love to try that out, to sleep during the trip! The wife says she prefer I drive, I see why? ha.

There is not a negative thing I can say about the Windstar, it truly is an all around Five ***** vehicle and it might just be the perfect new addition to your family.
