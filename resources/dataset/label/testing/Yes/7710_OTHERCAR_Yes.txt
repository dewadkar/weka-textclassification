            I for one am a hilariously happy owner of a '99 Chevy Tahoe.
I cannot say enough good things about this car, I love it !
Before owning this car we owned a MiniVan of another make which I hated, and could never get any satisfaction from the company when things went wrong, and alot of things did.
We've got about 21,000 miles on our Tahoe and so far haven't had a stitch of trouble (I'm knocking on my wooden computer desk)
We have 3 kids and it is plenty roomy for all of them without too much complaining.
I think it has excellent power and gets decent gas mileage for the size of vehicle it is.
I would defiantely recommend the Tahoe for anyone wanting a larger than average vehicle without feeling like you're driving a bus.<br><br>
