            This was a tough choice, but in the end, after driving both, I chose the I30 for a few reasons.

1. Looks.  The TL just doesn't look special.  Of course, this is subjective, but the I30, especially from the front, is the perfect combination of class and performance.  The interior is gorgeous as well, especially the dash gauges and the shifter, both very well done.

2. Engine.  The I30 seemed quieter to me, and the power of the engine at every range is excellent.  It loves to pull.

3. Room.  More interior room in the I30 which is useful when you have adults in the back seat.  I'm 6 feet tall and the back seat of the TL was noticeably smaller.  I'm perfectly comfortable in the I30.

4. Stereo.  Sounded better in the I30.  As a former DJ and one who's installed after market stereos in almost every car I've owned, I was very impressed with the Bose system.  I'm not a big fan of Bose, but they've tuned this system beautifully for the car.

Negatives?  The only thing that occasionally bothers me about the car is the transmission's upshifts when under hard (OK, very hard) acceleration.  The TL and the Lexus ES300 both shifted more crisply.  The I30 seems to lag a bit before upshifting to the next gear.  Again, I only notice this when really pushing the car.<br><br>
