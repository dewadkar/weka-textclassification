            I love this car. I bought my 1999 3.2TL in April and had to wait until May for delivery. These cars are hard to find, and very high in demand! 
The TL reeks of Quality: high quality plastics, wood, and supple leather make the ambiance of the cabin an experience to look forward to.
The controls are exactly where you would want and expect them to be. They are simple to use and in the line of sight. Every one clicks and slides with fabled Acura precision. 

In my young years, I have driven many cars, and I can tell you that only the BMW 3-series, specifically the M3, handles more predictably than this car in this price range. In fact, I had all intentions of purchasing a BMW 328i, but after test driving the Acura, I felt it was a much better car for the money. The space for the rear passengers is plenty ample! Even I was surprised to find that much space in this type of car. The BMW is smaller in every dimension. It is also underpowered, and noticably so compared to the 3.2TL. Using the TL's 4-speed StepTronic tranny is downright fun, and the 225hp six makes it seem effortless. The car glides at 40, 70, 120mph... not that I've ever gone THAT fast...ahem.  The BMW is a fantastic car, and if you prefer something smaller and sportier, you will love it. I chose the Acura over the Bimmer because I wanted more for my money and I would choose the TL over the 3-series on a long trip any day.

The luxury quotient is also evident. Heated seats, the excellent Bose stereo, Xenon headlamps, Homelink, automatic climate control and theatre lighting are only few of the standard features. The only factory option for '99 was the state-of-the-art navigation system, which I purchased and found to be an excellent investment. Of the other nav systems I've used, those in the Audi, Lexus, BMW and Mercedes, I've found that the Acura's and Lexus' are easiest to use, not to mention they have huge (6&quot;-7&quot;) color screens for easy reading compared to those of their European competition.

MY GRIPES: I had to have some, right?! Some are small, and some are not. First of all, I really wish the car had more sport-oriented rubber. Acura no doubt chose low friction tires to enhance the luxury characteristics of the TL, but I think high performance tires would be a great addition to the sporty flair of this car. Also, a 5-speed transmission would be great, although Acura has addressed this issue; 2000 models offer a 5-speed StepTronic tranny. My other issues, such as side airbags (not available in the 1999 model year), and a DVD-based navigation system, as opposed to the 1999's hard-disc drive system, have also been addressed.
I also paid MSRP for this car, as perhaps some others have as well, having read some of these opinions. I had the dealer throw in more wood on the dash, floor mats and splash guards. Also, I wish the car had a telescoping steering wheel. But I hardly ever think about that. 

Overall, I never regret paying full price or waiting for this car. It was worth it for sure. Feel free to email me if you have specific questions or want to comment on this review. <br><br>
