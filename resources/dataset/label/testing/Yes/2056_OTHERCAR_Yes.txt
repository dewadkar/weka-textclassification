            When my parents decided to buy a new SUV, I was excited to go car shopping with them.  We had narrowed it down to two vehicles: a 2000 Explorer and a 2000 Yukon.  Both were in the same price range, and both had their pros and cons.  We thought of multiple ways to compare them, they seemed almost equal after the brief test drives.  We ended up getting the Yukon as its interior was in better condition and we liked the exterior color more.  We couldn't have made a better choice.

The engine in this vehicle is a Vortec engine which has more power and torque than a normal engine.  We can lay a patch of rubber 20 feet long, and you have to remember it is an SUV.  I've driven it through rain, snow, mud, and sand, and never had to worry about not having enough guts to make it through.

The handling is a bit twitchy, and is a bit difficult to get used to at first.  It is very tight, tighter than my Grand Am's steering.  This is both good and bad, it makes the vehicle almost effortless to drive, but you can throw it around easily if you aren't paying attention.

The interior is well designed and comfortable.  The instrument panel is intuitive, and the controls for the radio are easy to use.  Switching to 4WD is a breeze with the push-button controls.  There are also seperate climate controls for both front and back seats.  The only specific downside is the control of the lights which isn't very intuitive and takes some experimentation to figure out.

We have driven this vehicle about 10000 miles since we got it and haven't had a single problem with it.  It has been on multiple road trips, and also been taken up rough mountain roads.  It has served us well every time.

This vehicle is good for anyone who wants a mix of power and finesse, and is willing to pay a little for it.  The only problem of owning this vehicle is that it is a little on the large side; it almost doesn't fit in our garage.

All in all, this is a very good vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone.
