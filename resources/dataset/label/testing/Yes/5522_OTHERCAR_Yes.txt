            I have been driving my 1999 GMC Envoy for about 1000-miles and have fallen in love with this unique vehicle. It truly offers something for everyone to love!

I spent the past year driving a new Dodge Avenger, frequently in excess of 100-mph and as often as possible on winding roads...a true thrill. So you can imagine I was truly a hard-sell on any SUV, and very discriminating at that. But GMC's 4300 Vortec engine (although SINGLE port fuel injection, for economy I suspect) is quite a performer. It has no trouble blasting the 5,300-pound beauty from a dead stop to highway speed as quickly as necessary...even sporty enough for those stoplight drag races with just about anything in it's class and some so-called sports sedans, to boot! 

Don't forget this vehicle was built as a serious off-road performer. It has no trouble dealing with any road surface or lack thereof!

Luxuriously appointed in it's base form, starting at about $34,500 the Enjoy is a GMC &quot;Jimmy&quot; on the outside (Envoy Door mouldings &amp; front/rear ground effects are unique) and a Cadillac (so to speak) on the inside.
Rich Zabrano wood trim and overly-padded, heated, 8-way adjustable w/memory, bucket seats are STANDARD. As are 6-CD changer &amp; BOSE 6-speaker w/amp sound system; Steering wheel mounted radio/cd controls; leather wrapped steering wheel; 12-volt on-board air compressor &amp; hose; Auto leveling controller w/air shocks; locking axle; 2-wheel, 4-wheel, or all-wheel drive shift-on-the-fly transmission; power-folding, heated, electrochromatic mirrors; keyless entry w/seat memory keyed to the driver's remote; high intensity discharge headlamps; concealed towing package; and computer controlled climate.

A sunroof and coolant heater are available options. ON-STAR is also an available option as the vehile is pre-wired for a hands-free or hybrid portable GM supplied phone.

This vehicle truly drives itself. The lights are automatically controlled using sophisticated light sensors &amp; computers...this is NOT &quot;Twighlight Sentinal&quot;. It's a next generation vehicle illumination system.

The radio volume is automatically adjusted according to your speed.
And of course, information from many of the on-board computers can be accessed at the touch of a button... such as fuel economy - whether instant or based on the past several hours' driving; temp. &amp; compass info.; range (miles to empty); even fuel used since your last &quot;reset&quot;.

And of course, IT'S BEAUTIFUL! I turn heads wherever I drive it!<br><br>
