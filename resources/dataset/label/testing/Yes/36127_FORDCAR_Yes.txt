            	New for 2000, the Ford Focus is much improved over the Escort.  At first, I was skeptical about the newly designed car.  Claims of roominess, and a great ride seemed too good for an economy car.  However, the Focus provided many surprises.

	I found driving through the city to be was very relaxing in the Focus.   The car was responsive, and the suspension did, as advertisements demonstrate, absorb all of the jolts from railroad tracks.  

However, the Focus lost some of its charm when I took it from the city to the highways and back roads.  Acceleration to merging speed is only average and well below my standards for a light car.  The most disturbing attribute of the Focus is apparent when the pedal is pressed to the floor, and the car sways drastically from side to side.  Unfortunately, this even happened on a straight, flat road at a leisurely 35 mph.

	The exterior of the car is daring and modern, but it is still obvious the Focus is an economy car.  However, the interior has more resemblance to a midsize car.  The front seats are supportive, and there is plenty of head and leg room.  The backseat is somewhat cramped, but it is very spacious and comfortable for a small car.  Overall, the Focus has an open and spacious feel, but there is an hint of cheapness in some of the materials

Plenty of features that make driving a pleasure instead of a chore are standard on the Focus.  Power locks and windows are very convenient, and a CD helps to pass the time in a traffic jam.

The Ford Focus is a worthy automobile, and is exceptional for its class.  I would highly recommend it for those who spend most of their driving time in city, but think twice if you drive aggressively or frequently use crowded highways.
