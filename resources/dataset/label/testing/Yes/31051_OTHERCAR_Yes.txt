            	...Are three ways to describe the 1991 Suzuki Sidekick.  This vehicle is exciting, entertaining and fun.  I use it as a winter vehicle and except for standard maintenance, this SUV has never failed me. 

	Features in my winter SUV include the conveinance of tinted glass, a distinctive sport steering wheel, power windows/doors, a rear door lock release and a remote fuel-filler door release, analog instrumentation and a state of the art AM/FM cassette with four speakers. 

	The seats are extremely comfortable.  I even took a nap in mine once!  The seats have bolstered cushioning which conforms to your body and keeps you comfortably in place.  No buckboard wooden slats here!

	Equipped with automatic transmission, I really appreciate this vehicle.  No hassles in the stop and go traffic. 

	The optional aluminum wheels my Sidekick has are excellent on pavement and turbo-charged on dirt.  You could say they lead a double life. 

	This is an ideal getaway vehicle.  With great 4-wheel drive agility, the Sidekick is perfect whether your journey is across town or out of town. 

	Unlike some SUVs I have seen on the road, this more logical sized Sidekick is a lot easier to parallel-park on city streets.  Other SUVs are so obnoxiously sized that they can't fit in a lot parking spots!  

	The Sidekick is a pleasantly quiet ride and it is excellent on gas mileage.  I don't have to even spend 20 bucks to fill up my tank!  Lots of the bigger SUVs on the road today are such gas hogs.  It's no wonder gas prices are so high!  There are simply too many of them on the road.  If every SUV driver owned a Sidekick instead, the gas price world would be a better place!

	So if you're looking for reliability, comfort and a vehicle with good gas mileage, then go pick up a Suzuki Sidekick today.  You won't be disappointed!
