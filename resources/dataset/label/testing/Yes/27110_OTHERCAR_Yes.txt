            I bought my 1995 Cutlass Supreme  Convertible one of 4000 produced in 1995 in the summer of 2000. It came back to the original dealership it was purchased at on a 5 year lease. it had 48,000 miles on it. It had every option it is Dark Teal Metallic (special Oldsmobile iridescent color in 1995)with Arctic White Leather interior trimmed in black which was covered by a black canvas rag. it has a white boot, (which compliments the very bright white interior nicely while covering the top in the down position). It has the 3.4 liter Dual Overhead Cam engine and dual exhaust (4 pipes sticking out the rear) and the upkicked trunk lid and taillights emulating a cleaner looking spoiler. I paid $10,500 for the car (the original window sticker which was in the glove box said the car was $32,000 new). I have put 7 thousand miles on it since then. have had absolutely no problems with the car involving service or mechanical failure. Everyday I take the car out and drop the top i get a compliment from at least one person no matter how far I go or how long I have it out (which bothers me considering I have several 66-67 GM A body Musclecars a GTO and a 442 to be exact and I don't hear half the compliments about these cars as I do for my 95 Cutlass). I would recommend the car to anyone, as a matter of fact my fiancï¿½e bought one several weeks after I purchased mine in ironically the same color with a tan top and tan leather interior). The top is very air and water tight in all climates. The Bose premium sound speakers are loud enough to completely drown out a 90 mph wind with the top down (literally). The car is nimble around corners and very quick off the line with the 3.4 liter engine and the 4 speed automatic transmission has very firm solid upshifts and at consistent rpm range at all positions of the throttle. The leather seats are very comfortable and the controls for the radio and heater are positioned nicely on the steering wheel.  Everyone I know loves this car and everything about it. If you are in the market for an awesome second car or out to impress someone with a first and can put up with 17 miles per gallon (think power) on a daily basis, then I would definitely recommend trying to find one, but you'll need luck at this. A 1994 is just about the same with the exception of the dash (single air bag and the dash is flat). The 3.1 liter v-6 is a descent alternative for gas mileage as well. I have one in my 1997 Cutlass Supreme 2 door coupe that i am pleased with, they are less prone to mechanical failure and achieve alot better gas mileage. Overall this car wins my heart even after I make payments on it every month and drive it once a month as well.
