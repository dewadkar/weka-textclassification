            While driving the Galant(a rental for a short business trip) I noticed that the steering was nice and tight, sharp responsive control does not seem to be Mitsubishi's problem. However being a former owner of a Mitsubishi Galant ES in 1990 I was not impressed with the trim package offered for the price. Every option this was once a car with the potential to scare CAMRY and ACCORD owners to the Mitsubishi dealer, I believe in order to compete the Galant will have to be quieter and offer a V-6 at all trim levels. If this were a step up from a first new Hyundai I can see you being very happy with it. But if you are looking for an equal to the compact imports you are barely in that category with the Galant. If you hate going to the mechanic, buy this car. My 1990 Mitsubishi NEVER broke down in 130,000 of ownership. What you see is what you get, but for the most part these are pretty reliable cars. <br><br>
