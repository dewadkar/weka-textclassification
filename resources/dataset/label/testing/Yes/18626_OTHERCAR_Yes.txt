            Thanks to an epinion.com article on Alero brake problems (warping rotors), I took my Alero in and got it checked.

I wrote before that my calipers had to be changed after 30,000km because they were ceasing. I recently took my car back to the dealer because of another brake problem and they told me that my rotors would have to be changed. They replaced the rotors and replaced the pads FREE (under warrenty)

When I was there they told me the engine was idleing too low. They loaded the new 2000/ 2001 idle speed and the engine is running like new. 

Besides the problems that I have been having I still feel that this car is great and I recommend it to anyone looking to buy a fun car to drive.
