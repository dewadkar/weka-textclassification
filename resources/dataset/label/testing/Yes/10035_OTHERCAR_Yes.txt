            Kia Sophia

It is a real low price for such a great car drives great and is fun gets alot of looks its not a real big car but just right. the interior is soft and shinny looks good in red it is somewhat of a cheap car, but is awsome it has a great radio and sterring it also handles great and good on gas it also warms up fast and i really like this car it makes your back hurt after a while but it easy to see out all the windows it is alittle fast the only thing i dont like about this car are the seats and the horn it looks good in bright red and tan interior but thats my opinoin its not much of a family car but great for teens. it also is supposed to go for 100,000 or 200,000 miles before first tune up not sure but its a great car.<br><br>
