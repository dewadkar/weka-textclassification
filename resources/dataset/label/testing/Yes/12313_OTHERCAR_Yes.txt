            Mitsubishi unveils the 2000 Eclipse SYPDER at the North American International Autoshow!!

The rumors about the status of the newest generation of Eclipse's convertible version have been wide and varied.  Some salesmen have said 2001, some 2002, some have said that there wouldn't be another SPYDER until the next redesign of the Eclipse.  News from Mitsubishi Headquarters itself had been nonexistent.  Until now.  

At the North American International Auto Show, Mitsubshi put those rumors to rest by unveiling the long awaited convertible version of it's newest Eclipse, the Spyder.  

The body design of the Spyder is nearly identical to the Coupe, sporting the fantastic 'Geo-Mechanical' styling that grew out of Mitsubishi's SST Concept Car and it's California based design studio.  Although the new generation's styling isn't quite as hard-edged as the previous generations, it's still cutting edge.  

If the product line is the same at the 98 and 99 Spyders, then there will be a GS and the top-of-the-line GT.

The GT version of the Spyder has a 200 Horsepower V6.  If it's the same enginge as the Coupe GT, then it's a 3.0L V6 SOHC SMPI 24-valve that actually produces 205 HP for the manual, and 200 HP for the auto-stick.
The GT also has large, extra wide, low profile 17&quot; x 6.5&quot; wheels.  Although the size of the wheels are the same as the Coupe GT, the styling is quite different.  Mitsuibishi has had major problems with the manufacturer of the Coupe GT wheels, and decided to put different wheels on the Spyder.  From what I can tell, they chose the 17 inch wheels from the 99 Eclipse GSX for the Spyder GT.

I didn't find an info about the GS, but if it's the same engine as the coupe GS, then there's a 2.4L I4 SOHC SMPI 16-valve engine which produces 155 HP.  The wheels on the Coupe GS were 16&quot; by 6&quot;, and I imagine they'll be the same size on the Spder GS.  I'm unsure if the wheel problem with the GT affected the GS, as far as different wheel style on the Coupe as compared to the Spyder.

Unless there have been some drastic changes from the Coupe to the Spyder, TURBO still has probably been left out.  Although the 1st and 2nd generation Eclipse owners cry foul at this, the fact that the GT has a 6 cylinder makes up for the lack of Turbo for the most part, and greatly increases it's reliability.

Sales of the Spyder are set to begin in just a few weeks!  Be on the lookout!

As indicated before, not much info is available yet on the Sypders.  But it seems as if the Spyders are the same as their Coupe Counterparts for the mostpart.  Take a look at my epinions.com in-depth review of the 2000 Eclipse for a great deal of info at:
