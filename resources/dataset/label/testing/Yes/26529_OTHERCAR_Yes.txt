            I purchased a Chevy S-10 pick-up in 1995, and I have adored it from the day I first sat in it! The truck looks great, drives great, and is just a terrific and reliable vehicle to own.  The truck is durable...you can drive it anywhere!!! I live in a rural area and we take it out on the mountains all the time...jumping mud holes...driving through creeks... you name it and we've probably done it!  The truck just never tears up! I've only had it in the shop for the normal maintenance (oil changes, tire allignment). The stero has really good reception, also. That is a factor for people who live in areas like me who usually can't get too many stations in.  I strongly encourage you to purchase this vehicle...cause simply put... IT'S ONE GREAT BUY!<br><br>
