            The very first car that I financed for myself, all by myself, was a baby blue 1987 Ford Tempo.  There was something about this car that I had always liked when they were new, and when I saw one on a car lot after the untimely death of my Ford Pinto, I knew that I just had to have it!

After a week of trying to find financing for a first time buyer with no credit, I was overjoyed to get the phone call that I had been approved for the loan, and that I could come pick up my car!

This car was 8 years old when I got it, and it had 79881 miles on it, but the car itself ran like a top!  Whoever owned it before I got it took wonderful care of it.  The interior was like new, and the engine was in excellent condition.

The first thing I did, was take the car to a mechanic to make sure that it was mechanically sound.  With the exception of a small oil leak on the oil pan, it was in terrific shape.

The Tempo became my baby.  Only the best gas, a detailing every payday, maintenance whenever it was recommended.  It was even during some routine maintenance that I was introduced to my husband, but that is another story altogether.  : )

All in all, I had very few problems with my Tempo.  One of the headlights had a short in it, and at times I had to bang on the lens to get the light to come on.  The radiator went bad, I had to replace the muffler, catalytic converter, and the CV joint (?).  But all of those conditions were just from old age and wear.

When I got the car up to 100,000 miles, my husband took it in to his shop and looked at the transmission (automatic) with full intentions of rebuilding it.  When he got the transmission all apart, he found that it was in nearly perfect shape, and only needed a couple of clutches.

I think, however, that the car had it's own agenda, and had no intentions of going much further than 100,000 miles because it started to act odd.  Stalling out, running rough, sucking gasoline like a hog.  At 120,000, my husband had a minor fender-bender, and because of the age of the car, the insurance company decided to total it out, so they gave us a check, which we took to the nearest auto mall to find a new car.

The Tempo got us safely to and from the auto mall, and then promptly died as my husband pulled into our driveway.  It never ran again, and 3 days later, the insurance company sent a flatbed to take it away.<br><br>
