                 I bought this van because it seemed the best for my family size.  My husband and I talked with many people who owned this van to see what they thought. The vast majority of them would buy one again. There seems to be very few problems with the engine or otherwise beyond normal wear and tear things like tires and oil changes. 
     We have three children and chose the van with the captain's chairs. This avoids the &quot;she hit me&quot; syndrome as each child has their own seat.  The double doors lets me get to the baby with ease and the older two can go out the second door.  This to me makes my life so much less complicated.  I just love the bar in the back to hold the grocery bags so they don't slip and slide around the van.
     This van also has a good amount of power. I hate getting on the gas and a car not going anywhere.  I have not had this worry.  Its easy to handle on the road and the ride is wonderful.  The last car was an Explorer and I felt every bump in the road.  I think that as long as I have more than one child at home, I will own a Dodge Grand Caravan
