            If you're thinking of buying a 1998 Toyota Camry with a V-6 engine, you're heading down a safe path. However, you shouldn't think you're getting a flawless car.
The Toyota Camry is a solidly built automobile which handles well in almost any weather condition. The ride has very few bumps, and gives one the feeling of safety.
While there hasn't been any problem with the engine, there have been minor problems that has led me to at least three trips to the dealer.
Two months after making the purchase, the door locks failed. With a couple of key turns on the driver's door, one should be able to open all of the doors. Not so. I had to take it back to the dealer for a repair. After spending two hours at the dealer, I thought it was fixed. Wrong. Within another two months, the same problem occurred again. And once again, the dealer repaired it at no charge. I wasn't concerned about the bill, I was more concerned about the amount of time I spent waiting for the repair to occur. The third trip was less involved; the tape used to accentuate the body of the car began to show signs of age. Once again, the dealer repaired it without any charge.
With the V-6, one can expect to get about 23 miles to the gallon in city driving.
