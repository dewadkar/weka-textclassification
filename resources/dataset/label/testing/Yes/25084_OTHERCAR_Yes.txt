            Within the past year or so, I've had the chance to drive three different 2001 SUVs on weeklong rentals: a Dodge Durango, a Jeep Cherokee, and a Ford Expedition. If the truth be told, I wasn't particularly impressed by any of the three, mainly because of their road handling. All three displayed an irritating tendency to wallow down the highway like an ocean liner caught sideways to the waves. One might get the impression from the three that SUVs as a class handle the road about as well as a sailboat that's lost its keel.

That's why I was pleasantly surprised when I took to the road in a shiny blue 2002 Chevy Trailblazer. "Where," I wondered, "is that rock-a-bye baby sensation I've come to expect from SUVs?" The Trailblazer took small bumps in stride and damped large ones, instead of turning every irregularity in the road into a miniature roller coaster. Then too, the Trailblazer went where I sent it, when I told it, instead of wandering about the road presumably in response to vagrant breezes. In short, I'd finally found a standard-sized SUV that actually handled moderately well (I haven't driven any of the imports, so can't comment there). So now you're certain I'm about to write a glowing review of the Trailblazer, full of gushy praise and heartfelt recommendations. 

I'd love to, but I can't. Tell you what: I'll be gentle, but honest


<b>Mechanicals</b>

With a peppy 4.2-liter six under the hood delivering 270 horses, the 2WD Trailblazer has plenty of reserve power for freeway onramps and highway passing. Yet, it still drinks fuel at a more economical pace than other, similar-sized SUVs. EPA numbers are 15/21, my 900-mile test drive (mainly highway driving) came in at about 19 MPG. The key is an economical four-speed overdrive automatic transmission. Acceleration is strong on takeoff and on the road, though the transmission has an annoying tendency to "hunt" when punched at highway speeds (give me a manual, any day)

Handling is very good for the class; the Trailblazer corners more securely than the Durango or Cherokee, and also holds the road better. Shock absorption is good, meaning that the vehicle does not rock and sway over every little bump. It also tracks well, without the annoying wandering sensation so prominent in the Cherokee. The driver has a good feel for the road through the steering column, yielding crisp, responsive turns. There is a "tippy" sensation when cornering; not unusual for high-profile vehicles. Note, however, that the four-wheel drive version will probably have a more pronounced version of this sensation.


<b>Style Guide</b>

The Trailblazer -- a replacement for the venerable Blazer -- is intended to combine brutish good looks with a nod to elegance; but aren't they all? The new vehicle's tall, boxy lines give it an appearance of a knockoff of the Land Rover (the quintessential TMMTLS* vehicle). The large, integrated front and rear bumpers impart a streamlined appearance without the excesses in styling seen on the Xterra of Nissan Frontier trucks. I wonder, however, just how much it'll cost to replace one of those massive body panels when someone backs into your Trailblazer in a parking lot (and leaves without a note).

The Trailblazer is more than merely a restyled Blazer body and interior, it's also significantly longer than the existing design. This gives you a larger, though narrower, cargo compartment (over 80 cubic feet with the seats folded). There is, however, no third row of seats, not even as an option. So why did they make it longer, I wonder?


<b>The Passenger Compartment</b>

Easily fits five people, with good leg, shoulder and head room in the back seat. That back seat -- like everybody else's -- has a 60/40 split (well, more like 62.7/37.3, if you ask me) for fold-down. When stowed, the back seat forms a nice flat compartment for cargo; no lumps or bumps to make loading and unloading uncomfortable. Folding them, though, seems to require a third hand; tough to do when your arms are full of groceries or the crumpled pieces of your mountain bike. Note: I'd've said <i>comfortably seats five</i> instead of <i>easily fits five</i>, because it isn't comfortable: the seats are like rocks (well, the driver's seat is, anyway) and driving two hundred miles in this thing may well give you a bit of lower back pain. 

Road  and engine noise were not a problem, even at highway speeds. There was an appreciable wind noise, however, that seemed to have been coming from the roof rack.

The dashboard is well laid out, with the standard two big dials (speedometer/tach) plus four gages (ammeter, oil pressure, temperature, fuel). There is a row of idiot lights across the top for messages like "a door is ajar" (it's not, a door is adoor!). On luxury models, there's a whiz-bang information center (fuel economy, time, distance, etc), but the LS I rented didn't have one -- a good thing, since I'm easily distracted by them, anyhow. The displays are good, though the lettering is somewhat small. The reset button for the trip odometer can only be found by feel.

The cockpit is roomy, with three cupholders in front (two fold out in the rear), a medium-sized glove compartment, storage for CDs in a console compartment, and map pockets molded into the door. The roominess is somewhat reduced by bulky fittings that are apparently meant to wrap you in a coccoon, but just seem claustrophobic. The central surface of the dashboard contains climate and sound controls, a welter of knobs and buttons. There are two power ports in the front (one configures as a lighter) and a third on the back of the console; Chevy also provides a removable ash tray to fit into one of the cupholders -- I suspect the position would be rather awkward for smokers, though.

The sound system is more than adequate; it's quite good (for factory installs). The stock system on my rental included AM/FM/Cassette/CD (CD changers are optional). Features include auto volume control, autoseek for traffic reports (which didn't work as well as I'd have liked), and autoseek for stations of a specific type. There is a separate volume control for the back seat located on the back of the console. 

The climate control seemed weak to me; it had a tough time catching up to the Houston humidity, even though the temperature only topped eighty one day. The defroster did not seem to have much "oomph," either. 



<b>Engineering Boo-Boos</b>

For me, the Trailblazer suffered from iconophilia: everywhere you looked were icons instead of words; so much so that the turn signal stalk looked like the top of a netscape browser! Icons for the wash/wiper/intermittents, turn signals, headlight bright/dim, and cruise control littered the stalk like broken bits of white plaster. Only from prior experience could I figure out what did what in that mass of little pictures. The radio and climate control have much the same icon fixation, though they're easier to decode in that context.

It took me two days to figure out which side of the power door locks was "lock" and which was "unlock."  Bur seriously, if somebody'd run off with my laptop, I was gonna sue!  While on the subject of locks, the "liftback" and "liftglass"cannot be locked with a key, only with the power switches on the front doors. That means every time you get into the back, you also have to unlock the front doors to relock the tailgate. <b><i>Dumb!!!</i></b> but perhaps it was meant as an incentive to spring for the remote entry system?

And what's with all those little nooks in the walls and floor of the cargo area, anyway?!

"Clink!" says the hood when you close it; not the reassuring "thud" of many solidly-built vehicles. The tinny sound was also present when adjusting the steering wheel tilt. The driver's side rear door was also stubborn about closing fully. Otherwise, the quality seemed better than average. The vehicle has about 9000 miles on it now without squeaks or rattles yet, and had no obvious manufacturing defects.


<b>Overall</b>

<i>Accelerator Pedal</i>

+ responsive handling
+ roomy rear seat and cargo area
+ good power with reasonable economy
+ sound system
+ instrument panel layout

<i>Neutral Zone</i>

= first model year (a scary proposition)
= reasonable FUEL economy
= heated mirrors (well, it's neutral around here -- I'd make 'em a positive if I moved back up north)

<i>The Brakes</i>

- uncomfortable driver's seating  
- rear gate lock system
- over-reliance on icons
- weak climate control
- tinny feel to some body components    


I like it, except for the seating comfort (a BIG problem) and those strange engineering quirks. I felt that the Trailblazer beat the price/size competition I've driven to date (Durango, Cherokee). I'd want to look at others in the class first, especially the entries from Toyota and Nissan. If you're dead set on a seven-passenger vehicle, then this one will not fit your needs (check out the Ford Explorer). Don't ask me why, ask GMC. I'm also a bit tentative about buying a vehicle in its "shake-out" model year. Though the rental performed admirably for a thousand miles or so, I'm inclined to keep my vehicle for a hundred and fifty times that long.
