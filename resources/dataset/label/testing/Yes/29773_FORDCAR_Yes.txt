            We purchased our Ford Explorer, Limited in 1996 just in time for one of the largest snowfalls to hit the Virginia area.  Having never owned a 4 wheel drive before, we were like kids with a new toy in the snow.  When virtually everyone else was stranded, our Explorer was able to take us anywhere we wanted to go.  

We purchased the Limited model as a replacement for a sedan that I was driving because of the air ride suspension system.  We felt that this allowed the SUV to handle more like a passenger car - and it does.  the biggest surprise after our purchase was that my wife enjoyed driving the Explorer as much or more than I did.  Just recently we purchased a replacement for my wife's car and she chose to drive the Explorer versus the replacement. She really enjoys the high driving position that allows her to have a commanding view of the road and, because most drivers will now pay her respect.  this is particularly important in the heavily congested area of Norther Virginia.

We now have more that 70,000 miles on our Explorer and it has been completely trouble free.  We have used it to haul furniture, camping equipment, building supplies, sports equipment, etc. and it still surprises me with how much we are able to pack into the rear.

The only negative that we have about the vehicle is the rear seat.  It is not very comfortable to sit in and the ride back there is not nearly as good as it is in the very comfortable front seats.  this has not been a major factor because we rarely have passengers. The V-8 was not available when we purchased.  We would recommend the v-8 engine.  the V-6 is OK; but, I would prefer a bit more power.

Because of the very favorable feelings we have about our Explorer, we know that we will always have an SUV.  When it is time to replace this one, we will definitly look at another Ford product.<br><br>
