            I am glad that this car isn't seen more on the road... It is such a great little car!! I feel like I own the road in it, and it&#146s so rarely seen still that it ALWAYS turns heads.

The performance that this car makes out of 130 horsepower is quite amazing. Although I must admit, I was quickly looking for more ways to boost the power without voiding my warranty.

The stability and handling of this car are amazing! Incredible brakes, tight suspension, and still rides without jarring your kidneys over the rough California roads.

We got ours with the manual transmission, which I highly recommend. This is a sportcross car. It is meant to be driven with authority, and to maximize the power, the stick is the only way to go.

The interior is quite comfortable, and with only 400  miles on the odometer so far, I haven't put it through the long distance test yet. I cannot imagine that I will be sore after a 500  mile trip though.

I really love the car - I got it for my wife whose specifications for the car were this:
1) A four door that looks sporty.
2) A car that has some power, but gets good gas mileage.

I think that our choice fit the bill quite perfectly. She is very happy with all aspects of the car, all of her wants were met, and I get to sneak away with it every chance I get!!
