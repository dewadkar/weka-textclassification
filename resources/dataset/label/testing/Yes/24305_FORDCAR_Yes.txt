                 <b>Engine and Transmission:</b>


The engine is a little anemic for the relatively light weight of this car. The 1.9 liter MPI ( multi port fuel injection) engine performs quite well after 4,000 RPM but before that RPM is achieved it is quite the slow poke. The 5-speed is well matched for a car with this kind of power. The power the engine produces 88 bhp which is reached at a relatively low RPM so it's not that bad of-the-line, plus you get great gas mileage whether you are in town or on the freeway. You are not buying this car for its outright engine performance anyway, right? So all-in-all performance is not too bad, just don't plan on racing, as most owners will also tell you. Just keep your mind on the 38  MPG you are getting while cruising on the highway. 

<b>Handling</b> is adequate, slight body roll, and sway is noticeable, but again this car is no performance machine, nor is it meant to be.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i> 

           <b>Interior:</b> Fairly good ergonomics are offered in the small cabin, everything is in reach, but that really isn't saying much considering how small this car is. A somewhat modern dashboard is provided, much better than the 1st and 2nd generation Ford Escort's but even for a '94 model it feels a bit dated. The '94 Honda Civic seems like a 'concept future car' compared to the '94 Ford Escort in terms of being modern. The seats are made well, and are comfortable, although the automatic seat belts are annoying and are constantly getting jammed. Ford should have recalled this safety problem long ago, yet refused. The doors shut with an reassuring clunk. The stock stereo system won't blow your ears out, but it's a good sounding 4 speaker ideal for a small basic econobox. Amenities are few and far between, but after all, this is an economy car, not a Lexus, although the standards are being set higher each year for economy cars, i.e. the 2003 Toyota Corolla. I do like the standard automatic door lock safety feature, something you usually find in more expensive cars.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

           <b>Exterior:</b> This car is more average looking than anything, kinda like that boy in school that never gets noticed, but also never gets called 'ugly'. This is a car that 'will' get lost in traffic, meaning it does not offer distinct styling, but I can't stress enough that this is an economy car made in 1994, not too much visual art went into this car. The '94 Ford Escort was made for ultimate gas mileage for people like me who have better things to spend their money on, other than gasoline, not to catch ones eye with the curves of my car.

             <i>Price & Reliability:</i> 

These cars are going for so cheap now, I saw one in the paper for 3,000 dollars, not bad for a 'semi' reliable car that will get you where you want to go. Not to mention a car that won't get laughed at, or make you hide it when family members come over. My reliability problems are not only isolated to me, I have had a leaking head gasket once, and constant seat belt problems.

<b>Update AUG 2002:</b> Sold this car with 180,000 miles on the odometer. The car proved to be somewhat reliable and continued to get great gas mileage until I sold this vehicle.
