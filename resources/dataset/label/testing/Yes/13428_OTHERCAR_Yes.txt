               Having always been a lover of the bigger car, it was a big change trading for a Blazer 4x4. My work situation had changed to where I was travelling to different locations for 13 week assignments. So I searched for a vehicle that had the power to handle the winter climates, as well as the extra room  needed to haul personal belongings. Also the ability of towing when needed.
    I recently traded my Blazer due to the fact that I was working 60 miles from my residence, and if my math is correct that means 120 miles daily..........The one and only reason I traded was this vehicle was a gas hog. Even if not in 4 wheel drive, I was fueling three times a week. While I did own the Blazer this was my only negative experience. The ride was smooth and had great pick-up. I loved the tinted windows, especially considering so often I was carrying a load.
     Riding higher than the average car on the road is also a big asset. Was very easy to see what was around you, and up ahead. It handled with ease and ran smoothly. I did notice that on occasion, especially in rainy conditions the anti-lock breaks seemed to catch, but quickly released. This did not appear to be a problem however.
I would buy this car again, but by no means would it be my solo means of transportation............would make a great play vehicle.<br><br>
