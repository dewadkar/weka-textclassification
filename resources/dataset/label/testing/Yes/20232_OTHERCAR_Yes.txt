            After owning a Chev. Beretta for 9 years
the time had come for a new car. I am a 
Chevy loyalist (mine you my 1981 Caprice
is still going strong) and since Chevy stopped making the Beretta in 1996 I decided
to go with its replacement, the Malibu.
I have this car 3 years and it has been a pleasure to drive/own. I feel very safe and
secure in this car. I've only had 2 minor problems which the dealership took care of it right away. The problems consisted of a small
leak in the left rear tail-light and a switch
which caused the a/c to blow out warm air.
Both were fixed under warranty. If I had one
grip about this car would be V6 engine. At
times it feels like it has the performance
of a 4 and the gas drinking capabilities of
an 8. I guess this problem was rectified in
the 2000s with 20 more hp added. 
Overall I would recommend this car, as with
most Chevys you get good value, but most
of all it has been very reliable.
