            The Olympus D-370 (aka. C-100 outside of the US) is the first digital camera I bought and I've only recently felt the need to upgrade it. At the time of purchase it was around $200 but you can now pick up the same camera with the same features new for half that price which is great news...or opt for the update release (the D-380 for around $200 now) if you should so wish. Personally, I'd say if you were looking or a first time camera and you only have a small budget then the D-370 is still an excellent purchase.

What you get for your money is a camera which is aestetically pleasing as well as functionaly impressive as well. It's not too bulky, around 5" wide and sub 7 ounces in weight, with a sliding lens protector to make transportation a breeze, a wrist strap, 2MB onboard memory, USB connector, built in flash and a 1.5" digital viewfinder at the back for live preview or viewing of your snapped images...a good size for a small camera. The viewfinder is particularly impressive not just for it's size, but also because it performs so well in bright light - so many are nigh on impossible to use in bright sunlight, but not this one.

The camera requires 4AA batteries to operate and boasts a battery saving technology which makes your batteries last longer. Erm, it's fair to say that if this SAVES on battery life then I dread to think what the older models were like!! I find this camera gobbles batteries like crazy so you are well advised to invest in some rechargeable ones or it'll cost you a small fortune in replacements. Make sure also that you take a supply with you if you take your camera on the road as well and use the viewfinder sparingly or they'll run down lightning fast...and when you connect your camera to your PC to upload your images be prepared to watch them sucked dry in rapid time. Battery life is the single largest gripe about this camera.

But...the rest is all good news for a 1.3 Megapixel digicam. 

When it comes to using the camera you'll find it a doddle. I'm not going to run through each and every thing it does or I'll bore the pants off you, anal completeness is for other reviewers I'm afraid, if you want a list of specs, then visit the Olympus website. What I will say is that it is dead easy to use. The menu system is accessed through 4 buttons on the back, and is very intuitive - you'll have no problem with using this unlike with some others. If you've ever used an Olympus camera around this price range before in the last couple of years then you'll be more than familiar with the set up because it doesn't seem to have changed much in this respect and later models still use pretty much the same set-up as well.

The most important thing of all though is the quality of the pictures and Olympus has once more produced a camera which does the business. In normal light the images you take are excellent for a 1.3 Megapixel camera, not perfect of course not at this resolution and price, but excellent for the price and type of the camera. The D-370 is one of the best 1.3 Megapixel cameras on the market. Colour saturation is good and generally in normal light it can't be faulted. 

In bright and dim lighting conditions there are a few niggles, there can be some blurring or graininess and it does seem to have some difficultly with certain colours representations - I have an orange short which looks red with fuzzy edges when snapped in dim lighting with this camera for example...but generally it performs OK...you just take a little pot-luck as to how well you subject is going to come out in less perfect lighting conditions...sometimes it's an excellent result, sometimes distinctly average. Generally though, photo quality is good for a general home user and still tops for a 1.3 Megapixel camera.

You are given various options related to picture quality, but to be honest, unless you use the highest quality setting you are looking at distinctly average results. The inbuilt memory allows for just 1 photo to be taken on this highest quality mode so you'll be looking to invest in an SmartMedia card immediately - it takes from between 8MB to 128MB SmartMedia cards which are available at an additional cost - shop around, as the prices of these can vary quite dramatically (Walmart has cheap ones so I'm told). You also get to record Quicktime movies as well which are without sound but can be quite fun...again, the length of these is dependant upon the size of your SmartMedia card.

You camera will come bundled with some software to transfer your images to your PC, to which is connects via USB for ultra fast transfer rates - whatever camera you buy you'll be looking for a USB transfer or it takes forever! Be warned that the instructions on how to use this software are USELESS and the software itself is pretty useless too for that matter! It's there if you want it, but simply connecting your camera opens up a new drive (look under "My Computer" and you'll see it) and it's simply a case of cutting and pasting/dragging and dropping from here to transfer images...far simpler than messing around with the poor software!! As always, you are advised to invest in some imaging software to get the most from your results, cleaning them up, cropping, removing red-eye etc...the bundled software does a fw things, but its horrible.

I've had a few moans, but to be honest, you can pick this up for around $100 now, probably less through somewhere like ebay so there's little to really complain about. I was quite happy with most of the results I achieved with it and I think most others will be as well. If you have a little more money to spend then the 2.0 Megapixel Olympus D-380 is a better choice, but for half the price this is still a good option for the average home user.
