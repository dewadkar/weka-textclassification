            I waited until 2 months passed before writing this review to make sure that I am properly evaluating my new car and I'm not overwhelmed by the newness of it and the sales pitch.  I bought my new Saturn 2001 SC2 (3-door sports coupe) on July 31, 2000 and I am still amazed (It is now mid-October).  It seems like a dream each time I step inside it and I'm afraid I'll wake up and it will be gone.   Color: light silver.  Also have sun roof, automatic transmission, CD/cassette, leather interior, keyless remote entrance.  
  At first I was going to buy a used Saturn, so I went to the Saturn dealer and was prepared to pay cash for a used one.  I was surprised to see that a 97 Saturn with 40,000 miles was going for $10,000.  Although I could afford it I thought, "Gee, for a few thousand more, I can get a new one!" since the old ones hold their resale value so well.  The financing was also offering 1.9% for 3 years, so I thought that since I could afford it, why not get what I really want?
  I checked their web site, http://www.saturnbp.com/ for the details - what features I wanted and what I could expect to pay for them.   I also downloaded a coupon which entitled me to a $25 gift certificate at Borders books  if I took it to Saturn and had a test drive.
  I test-drove the SC1 and the SC2.  There is a noticeable power difference between the SC1 and SC2 in acceleration.   The SC1 was closer to my old 87 Toyota Tercel in power, which was acceptable, but not top-of-the-line.  I was more impressed by the other features such as the sun roof, adjustable height of the drivers seat, leather interior, AC, CD/cassette stereo, keyless remote and the standard Saturn safety features.  Also, there is the standard Saturn plastic coated exterior, so it is dent-resistant to dings and scratches from other car doors, shopping carts, etc.
  I bought the automatic transmission and within a week I was used to the more powerful engine than what I was previously used to.  
  I have not brought it to the shop yet, except to have Lojack installed (the optional security feature - used by the police to track down stolen cars).
  Another security feature is if someone tries to start the car without the proper key, it will not send gas into the engine.
  One of the minor disadvantages is the slightly cramped space of the seats.  The roof just barely misses my head by less than an inch (I am 5'9").  If you are tall I highly recommend trying the adjustable height seat before test-driving.   The seats (leather option) are comfortable, but the back seats are not unless you are short or petite (not unusual for sport coupes I am told).  
  I was surprised when talking to the salesman about the size of the sports coupe.  I thought that the 3-door would be shorter than the regular 4-door but in fact it is actually one or two inches LONGER.  That AND the back seat is more cramped than the the 4-door.  I don't understand the reasoning or even how that happened, but you would think that if there is less room for the back seat, then there would at least be less room in length, to save in parking room.  This is the only really negative thing I have to say about the car.
  The trunk is roomy, plus you can push the rear seats down to extend the room in the trunk.    
  There are more cup holders in this car than you will ever use.  More than 1 per passenger!  Don't ask me why.
  The stereo has a "theft-deterrent" feature so that if it is stolen it will not work.  Hopefully the thieves will know about this BEFORE they steal it.
  I have not yet taken it for a long drive but I am longing to just for the experience.  The CD sounds wonderful and if this were not my busy time of year I would take a week and drive to some of the nicer parts of California both for the views and for the driving experience.
  I found the sales experience just what it is advertised as: no pressure.  EXCEPT for the trade-in part.  I got the song-and-dance about "We don't sell these ourselves we can only give you $500 for your old car..." despite the fact I checked the blue book value and knew that for a trade-in I should be getting more.  I managed to talk them up to $800 trade-in value, but I still felt like I was being ripped off.
  One minor annoyance is that it heats up quickly in the sun (black leather interior probably has something to do with that).  Fortunately it comes with air conditioning which works quite well.  The sun roof and windows alone can cool the car off in about 5 minutes of moderate driving.
  Overall, it is my dream car and I hope I don't wake up.  
UPDATE:  It is almost a year since bought my Saturn and I still love it.  The quality of the service department varies from OK to poor (I have several friends with Saturns that hate one particular service department in the San Francisco Bay Area).   This of course, varies depending on the individual dealer, so you should check  http://caradviser.cars.com/intro.asp?affiliate=boston
and put your zip code into "Mechanic X-Files" for a recommended mechanic.
