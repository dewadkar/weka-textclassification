            I was torn between a fully loaded 2000 Explorer and the Land Rover.  Looking back on it, I can't believe I even considered the Explorer.

Let me tell you about my Beast.  (That's what I call it).

Interior-  It's so wonderfully comfortable.  Leather interior (extra but worth it), very high up, lumbar control, dual climate control, excellent sound system, panoramic view from all seats in the vehicle.  Having said this, I should say that with all of these bells and whistles, true to English style, this car is not gaudy.  The features are subtle and elegant.  My car stays muddy most of the time, and I throw my kayak on the top of it at least twice each weekend.  But when I'm inside of it, I would feel equally as &quot;at home&quot; in an evening gown. 

It's hard to argue that this car is practical.  It's not.  It guzzles gas. And that's PREMIUM gas, ALWAYS.  Service is expensive. It's not the car to drive if you want to race. It's just fun.  And it's comfortable.  I love the roominess.  Land Rover provides unparallelled customer service...from the minute you step in to the show room and through out the life of your car.  

I think I'll be a Land Rover owner forever.<br><br>
