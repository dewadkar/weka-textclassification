               The Toyota Camry station wagon, discontinued in 1996, is a very good car, and if you are in the market for a used station wagon, try to find one.  The 4-cylinder version (standard) is in itself relatively hard to find, and the V6 is damned near impossible, and if you drive this car you would realize why. 
   I was lucky enough to find a V6, and it is still running flawlessly.  A 1994 LE, the day I went to the dealer to get the car the salesman started it for me, I saw him start it, and I didn't realize it was running.  Once inside, the roomy front seats were appreciated greatly, as was the smooth ride that followed.  That was in 1996, and four years later the engine has gotten slightly, SLIGHTLY, louder.
   Maintenance is my next point.  The car is easy to forget to fix, because the only time its needed to go to the garage was for inspections and tire changes.  The engine is worry free and very efficient.  The all-disk break system is fantastic, as is every other aspect of the drive train.
   In the drivers seat is pretty much the same as under the hood.  Excellent handling and smooth ride, along with a climate control system that won't quit.  The only detraction for the inside of the car is lack of elbow room, two people fit well, but both can't use the armrest at once. Also the center console is hard to get at with two people in the front seats.
   The back seat has ample head room, but leg room is a bit compromised if the driver is back more than 3-quarters of the way.
   The stereo and other luxuries on the car work well, however the retractable antenna tends to be problematic. 
   The trunk has a third seat, which is great for small kids. Other than that it has plenty of room for luggage.  On the down side, a full sized spare doesn't fit. 
    The only quirk in the design of this car is the sun roof.  If the sun roof is installed, a roof rack is extremely hard to install correctly.  Even if it is installed by the dealer, it will cost about $500.<br><br>
