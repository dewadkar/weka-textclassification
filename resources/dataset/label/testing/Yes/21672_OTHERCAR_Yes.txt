            I bought my 1994 4runner SR5 4X4 to upgrade from a 1995 Toyota Tacoma Extracab 4X4 Truck.  I need the extra 
passenger room the four doors of the 4runner offers.  In my Epinion you can not go wrong with a Toyota, before the 
truck I drove a Camery and before that a MR2. The 1994 Toyota is the second generation of the 4runner family.  The 
original truck had the removable top and was much more utilitarian than the second and now third generation 
versions.  My 4runner was bought with 60K miles on it, and the inside and paint are like new.  The engine and 
mechanical are also in top shape.  The drivers position is very good in the 4runner and the seven way adjustable seats 
allows many adjustments.  I'm 6'3&quot; and fit very comfortably in the drivers seat with plenty of leg and head room.  The 
back seats are a little tight on leg room.  The cargo space in the 4runner is great and if the rear seats are folded up its 
cavernous back there.  The automatic transmission shifts very smoothly and although the 3.0 liter V6 takes a while to 
get up to speed the 4runner has no problem keeping up with traffic.  Gas mileage is as to be expected with a 4X4 
SUV pretty bad, 15 average city and 19 highway.  Expect to spend more time and money at the gas station if you 
drive one of these SUV's, but as with most Toyotas you probably will not even get to visit the dealer or mechanic.  I 
expect to drive this 4runner until I decide to buy my next Toyota maybe a Tundra or the new Sequoia.<br><br>
