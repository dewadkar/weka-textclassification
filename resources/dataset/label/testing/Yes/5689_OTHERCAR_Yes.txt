            I have recently been renting a 1998 Nissan Altima for the last 3 weeks.  I love almost everything about the car.  It drives like your on a cloud.  

The car has plenty of room in both the front and the back seats.  And the seats are comfortable enough to make long road trips.This car has an incredible amount of trunk space.  Of course, all this room means the car is slightly longer and wider than most cars in it's class.  I've driven big cars, vans, jeeps, trucks and little cars.  This car is slightly bulky and that can mean that parking can require some extra effort.  

As far as gas mileage goes this car is average.  I would say it gets about 30 miles to the gallon.  It could be better, but at least it isn't a gas guzzler like my Jeep Grand Wagoneer!  

The one flaw in this dream vehicle is the Air conditioning.  It is constantly fluxuating the temperature.  The coolness is attached to the acceleration of the vehicle.  If you are in stop start traffic the A/C is tepid.  Then once you get moving again you are subjected to artic winds.  I spend most of the time I have been in that car adjusting the A/C.   

The only other minor annoyance is the windows.  If you put the windows down while you are driving, then they will whistle when you put them up again.  But if you put the windows up before going over 25mph then you don't have a problem!  So I make sure to wait for a red light before closing the windows.

In conclusion, the A/C is a tempermental beast, but if you can handle that, then this car is a fantastic ride.  I can't tell you the cost of purchase, since I've been renting the car.  I myself have been considering looking at buying this vehicle, even though I am dedicated to buying American.
