            Kodak's Easy Share DX4330 digital camera is extremely easy to use.  It makes 3.1-megapixel captures that can be made into 8x10 prints.  It has fully automatic exposure control that performs well in a wide variety of conditions.  This camera features various preset scene modes that make taking pictures even easier.  Basically, this camera will let you take pictures like a pro without knowing anything about photography.

The included Kodak's Picture Software is the other half of the ease-of-use of this camera.  Downloading pictures onto the computer is snap.  And once you have uploaded the pictures, the software helps you crop them to standard sizes, get rid of red eye and change the contrast/brightness of the pictures.
