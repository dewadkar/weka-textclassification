            I had done my research on the internet before I even test drove the cars I had in mind, which was the Beemer & the Audi. These were my requirements - sporty, stick shift, safety, must be able to accomodate 4 adults (atleast), driver's side must be very comfortable (since I go on long drives often), reliability under the hood, sunroof. I had visited a BMW dealer near my home for a test drive of the 325i. I had decided I will buy a used car but not over 25-30K miles on it. I drove the 325i and was very happy with the drive that I decided to buy it but held back to give the Audi a chance. I visited the Audi/VW dealer and test drove the A4. I was happy with it but I had read earlier that there isn't much difference under the hood between an A4 and the passat and thus asked for a test drive of the passat since the dealership dealt with both Audi as well as VWs. I saw a 2000 black passat(stick) on display at the dealers and wanted to test drive that car. I drove it and was amazed to realize that I felt no difference in the handling between the A4 and the passat. Not only the handling but a lot of other things too (especially the sporty look). I fell in love with the car but wanted to satisfy myself before investing. Later that evening I went on edmunds.com and eopinions.com to compare the A4 and the Passat. By now, I had even forgotten about the Beemer that I test drove that evening. It was too expensive for its performance. My research revealed that the Passat was a great car and more so all my requirements (stated above) met. The turbo engine was awesome when it kicked in. I didn't feel any lag at all but remember I was driving a stick shift. Passing cars on the freeway was a breeze. This car was a steal with all the extras that I got along. This baby had a 6 CD changer in the trunk, sunroof, alloy wheels, heated front passenger seats, extra fog lights and the best of all 19K miles on it. That was it! Before I knew I was a proud owner of the Passat.

Now, to my post buy experiences. I have owned this car for about 6 months now and had gone to the shop thrice of which twice was for regular service and once for a squeeking noise whenever I pressed the clutch to switch gears. The dealers promised they would replace the part since my car was still under warranty. Now, this replacement thing was a painful process - somehow the spare part was not available on the date the dealer had promised that they would replace them for me in a week or two which they did after frequent followups from my side (Guess they ordered it from Germany). My 2 cents on the interiors - the designers of the cup holders hadn't thought about containers bigger than a coke can or probably the engineers at VW don't drink coffee in travel mugs. The other design problem I thought off was the head rest. The really don't serve the purpose except block some portion of the view on the rear view mirror. I feel the cloth seats are better than leather when it comes to winter. Its very comfortable but the only hassle being cleaning it frequently for lint.

To conclude, this is an awesome car and I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a car with a sporty look and also serves the family.
