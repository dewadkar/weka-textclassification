            I recently purchased a White Base Acura RSX, despite the fact that I'm a lot older than your typical buyer of this make and model. Coming from a late model Honda Accord Sedan, I can only say this baby ROCKS big time, and I would highly recommend this to any "BIG KID" that wants to have some fun in their everyday driving experience. It makes my commute more bearable, and the car gets lots of looks at red lights.

                                                             Starting with the EXTERIOR, the simple lines of this small sport coupe screams class all the way.  I believe there is just something about a white car that makes it stand out from the crowd.  The short snout with the cool headlamps sets the stage for the progressively higher rear end with circular brake lamps, and sloping expansive glass on the hatch. I added a rear spoiler, moonroof shade and mudguards to complete the look. All the seams are uniform and the clean lines of the car make it seem like it was chiseled from one piece of steel. There were no paint or body flaws at all.

Opening the door to the INTERIOR, the titanium leather seating area is firm, and the side bolsters seems to keep you firmly in place.  The dash board is an engineers dream with circular titanium gauges that are very easy to read, located in the center of the dash.  To the right are the 3 circular climate controls, and just below is the sound system.  The overall look is great as it is uncluttered and simplistic in design, yet supports the sporty nature of the car. Every knob or switch is located perfectly and operate silky smooth.  At night, the gauges turn a deep blood red, and are very easy to read.  My only complaint here is that the color is so cool, that it makes you want to stare at it while driving.  Forget any back seat, there is just enough room to put a briefcase or something on it. The expansive glass in the rear offers good visability, yet the wide C pillars might cause a problem if you want to pass, with limited side viewing. At 6'3" tall, there was plenty of leg room.  In fact, I had to adjust the seat forward for a comfortable driving position. Headroom was a bit too close due to the moonroof, so just adjust the seat a bit.  I found the interior deceptively spacious considering the outside profile of the car.

The PERFORMANCE of the car is nothing short of spectacular!.  For those that say this is a upgraded Honda Civic, I've got news for you.  Upon first turning the key, I was surprised how quiet the engine was....that is until I stared going down the road.  This thang is quick off the line, and the growl from the engine lets you know that it's ready to start cooking.  The 5 spd manual is a complete joy to drive, and it has perhaps the finest shifter ever put in a car.  Smooth, short throws....just plain sublime.  Without much throttle, I was doing 70 before you knew it, but kicked it down a bit as it is still break in time. There is tire noise that comes in the cabin, yet it wasn't that annoying.  The 16 " Michelin MXM4 Touring tires are OK, but I feel they do a disservice to the sporty nature of the car.  I'll probably upgrade to 17's after the winter, and buy a tire that grips just a bit better.  The small "go cart" style steering wheel is pretty neat.  Steering is precise, and taking turns just puts a smile on your face as there is very little body roll.  Sort of feels like your riding on rails!.  The car takes uneven payment OK, but the ride clearly lets you know that your not sitting in a Caddy.  I thing this car has plenty of get up and go, and I couldn't see spending the extra cheese and buying the "S" type for 40 more horses.  The torgue is the same in both cars, and the Bose system in the "S" isn't much of an improvement over the stock system in the car....which, by the way, sounds pretty good!  All in all, the driving experience was good, and I expect it to get much better when I have some miles on it.  Despite the harsh ride (it is a sport coupe afterall), I found extended driving to be quite comfortable.  Gas mileage for the first 2 tanks averaged 29mpg...not too shabby I would say!  

The biggest DISAPPOINTMENT would be that there are a few amenities that should have been placed in this car such as a center arm rest, auto up feature for passenger ( christ, how much does a switch cost?), illuminated mirrors, door lights and some room to store things.  I should also mention that insurance premiums are high, even for older experienced drivers.  This is due more than likely, to the punk kids that modify and race these cars and slam them into trees.  I went from a mid size sedan to a sub compact....yet my premium went up.  Ridiculous!!!..For those looking to buy, this car will not do you wrong, and if history suggests anything, it will give you years and years of enjoyment
