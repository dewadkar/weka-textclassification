            The wife walks in with a mischevious grin on her face... she then pipes up and says, &quot;I tell ya, I tell ya... I love that car!&quot;

The reason why she isn't writing this review is because she'd have nothing but good things to say about it. My opinion is somewhat more neutral, although I have no major complaints about it either. We bought our '97 740iL in July, 1999. Since we took delivery, we have not had any major hassles or problems with it at all. We bought it at Global Imports BMW for $44k, at 41k miles. We paid a grand or two too much for it, but it was what we wanted at the time and it was the only one in Atlanta with the Oxford Green exterior in the iL form. Plus, the doctor that previously leased it apparently had it detailed every other day because it is in immaculate shape; inside and out. You know a car's been pampered when the engine, undercarriage and wheel wells are spotless.

It drives like a dream, needless to say. It is so quiet and smooth on the road that I sometimes forget that I'm actually driving a car. Even for a car that now has 47k miles on it, it still rides and handles like new. I'm very impressed with the overall ride quality of these cars (we sold our Acura Legend a year before buying the 740iL, and I thought that car handled quite nicely!) This past summer, we took a road trip to Savannah for a few days to meet some friends who drove from Phoenix (yes, from Phoenix to Savannah)... we typically fly, but we decided to drive this time, and to tell you the truth, our BMW made all the difference in the world driving to the historic sites in and around Savannah. It certainly added a pleasant touch to an already wonderful trip. By the way, we averaged 25mpg on the interstate (not bad for a heavy, 8-cylinder car).

Fortunately, we have not been forced to take our BMW in for major service or repair, and the only time we did, the majority of the repairs were covered under warranty: replaced front passenger speaker cover (warranty), replaced dashboard instrument cluster (warranty), replaced both rear door chrome moldings (warranty), tire rotation ($60). The loaner car we were given was a brand new '00 323i, which was worth the hassle of bringing our car in! Talk about a quick little car, WOW.

The ten-speaker stereo system is nice, however, tracks with high bass tend to give the stock speakers a run for their money. It is also unfortunate that the six-disc CD changer is mounted in the trunk -- with all the interior space in the 740iL (and even in the 740i), and as high as the front seats are, I'm sure BMW could have come up with a way to mount the changer under the passenger seat. Speaking of seats, all are quite comfortable. I actually ENJOY riding in the back, believe it or not (I sometimes am banished to the back when certain household chores are not handled in a timely matter). Sitting in the back makes me feel like I'm in a limosine, since there is so much room. Quite enjoyable.

Also, I can back up the ear-popping issue when a lone rear window is rolled down while on the road. Unless you want to lose your hearing, make sure one of the front windows are partially opened before rolling down one of the rear windows. Not sure how BMW missed that in the wind tunnel, but they apparently did.

I could go on and on about how great this car is, but I think you get the idea. We plan on keeping this car forever, or until we upgrade to a newer 740iL. I can't hardly wait... I really love those 18&quot; M Parallel Spoke rims on the newer 740s!!
