            Our Odyssey is now 16 months and 20,000 old, and still going strong.  I do have a few comments that I didn't read anywhere else here, though.  Many other opinions are written during the Honeymoon phase.  We are well beyond that.  Don't get me wrong...this is a great van, and I still think it is the best on the market bar none.  However, it isn't perfect.  As everyone says, the stereo is pathetic, and doors are weird.  Here are my other comments.

1) Too many Recalls.  This is probably typical first year stuff, but there have been a lot.  Most took 2 trips in...they never have all the parts needed!

2) &quot;Check engine&quot; red light.  This has come on three times.  The first time, at &lt;5,000 miles, darn neared spoiled a vacation to Maine.  Each time the dealer turned it off, and said &quot;they get weird like that sometimes.  Everything is fine&quot;.  That gets REAL old after a while.

3) We find that regular gas is OK in town, but 89 octane is worth it on the highway.

4) BRAKES.  Overall the braking is OK, but only fair.  When loaded it always takes a lot of brake to slow this beast down.  Now we have a new problem.  Anyone else see this yet?  Our front rotors are heavily scored, although the pads are fine.  The dealer says a lot of around town driving causes this...they get too hot.  Where do they think mom-and-pop van owners are going to drive?  It is covered under warranty, but it still was pretty weak.

5) roof rack.  Who the heck decided to sell a van with only half a roof rack?  And even the wrong half...the front-to-back bars instead of the cross bars  Buying the cross beams was a necessity to actually use the rack.  Online was much cheaper...less than $90.

6) anyone have any experience with towing with the Odyssey?
