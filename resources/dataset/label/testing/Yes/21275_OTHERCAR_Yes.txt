              My parents got me this car when I graduated from high school.  The first time I saw it I was really excited I had this car.  I was in for a very big surprise when I started to look around inside the car and analyze it inside and out.  
  First of all, let's start with the wheels.  The wheels are durable, and sleek looking with a nice feel for the road.  Besides having four full size wheels to go on your car you also have a full size spare wheel in your trunk.  I could not believe it when I seen that I had a full size wheel in the trunk, instead of a donut.
  The body of the car is real nice.  The color of the body of my is grey and this color adds a professional, classy look to the car.  The body is also very durable and won't scratch easily.  It also has a smooth look with lots of appeal. 
  The interior of the car is also very intriguing.  The seats are very comfortable and have features which allow you to adjust the height and length of how far back you want the seat.  It is very spacious inside for a compact car and allows 4-5 people to seat conveniently inside the car.  The steering wheel, dash board and the rest of the car's interior necessity all are top of the line in manufacturing.
  You also get good gas mileage from this car.  I drive from college, which is about 3 hours away from my house and I only use 1/4 of a tank.  That is pretty good gas mileage on the highway.  In the city the Toyota Camry also gets good gas mileage.  
  This car is great.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a nice looking, luxury, top of the line 90's type of car.  Two thumbs, from Punch.  One.
