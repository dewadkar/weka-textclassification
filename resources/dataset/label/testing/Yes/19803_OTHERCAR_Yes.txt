            I test drove this car during this past fall as I was making a decision to purchase / lease a new car.  I unfortunately, did not pick the Cougar for several trivial reasons (aside from the near lack of a rear seat, which I didn't care too much for) but I was impressed enough to write a positive recommendation.  I loved the way the Cougar had a low profile, sat real close to the ground.  The wide axle and 16 inch wheels give you unprecedented handling which was what impressed me the most.  The V6 is plenty potent for this smaller sports car and ran rather well.  There are 2 things which I would SERIOUSLY have someone considering this vehicle think about my two factors; your height and weight.  I am 6'1 and about 230.  I must tell you I am in good shape and a college athlete but I could barely fit in!  Misjudging by the size of previous Cougar models I thought for sure I would have plenty of room.  WRONG!  I loved the car but I would seriously recommend a thorough test drive for any one over 5'10&quot;, other than that I loved it.<br><br>
