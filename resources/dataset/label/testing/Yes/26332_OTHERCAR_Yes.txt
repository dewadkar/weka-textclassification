            This is my second Astro Van and once again I'm thrilled with owning one. I go to camping events which require me to haul a lot of over sized items and the Astro has no problem taking it all. Plus the fact that if I did run out of room inside it has enough power to pull a trailer as well as being loaded to the gills!

The ride is as smooth as some luxury cars I've been in. I used to work in Mobile Home Parks and they are packed with speed bumps. The Astro handled the bumps in stride.

When we recently had to move the seats were taken out and the inside loaded with my king size bed frame head board and box springs (set of 2 peices) while the roof rack recieved the mattress. I don't know how many vans could handle that!

The only thing I don't like so far is that when we had to replace the battery the theftloc system took away my stereo. We purchased our van used and some one else had put in the unlock code. Once the stereo is detached from power the lock turns on and you must enter a code anywhere from 000 to 1999 to unlock it. If you don't have or forget your code you have 5 chances to get it right then you must wait an hour and then you only have 3 chances per hour after that. Of course you can go to the dealer and pay $75.00 and wait an hour for them to unlock your system. My self I think I'll try to get the code elsewhere, and save the $75.00 to start on a new better system!
