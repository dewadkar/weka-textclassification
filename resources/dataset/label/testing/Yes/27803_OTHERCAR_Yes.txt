            I edit a couple of newsletters and do a lot of other desktop publishing.  I needed a digital camera and I wanted one that was small enough to carry around in my pocket. I hate lugging a huge conspicuous camera around when I am trying to take pictures for a newsletter.  I researched all the cameras on the Internet and the Canon Digital Elph seemed to have the features I wanted at a price I could bear.  I ordered from a Web vendor. I arranged to receive it as a Christmas present from my wife.  It did not take long to learn all the functions and it was fun doing so.  I now carry it everywhere in my pocket and whip it out when a photo op presents itself.  Resolution up to 8x10 is acceptable and I generally find the camera adequate in every respect except that the flash is not very powerful and it does not do well in low-light conditions unless the subject is quite close.  I find this understandable and acceptable in a camera so small.  One might wish for longer battery life.  Spare batteries and a charger are a must.
