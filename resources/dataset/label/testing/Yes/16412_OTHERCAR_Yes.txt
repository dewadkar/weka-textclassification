            You really need to have a good printer to take advantage of this type of camera, so I wanted to remind everyone that you may be investing more money than you think if you are interested in printing out your photos.

I recently purchased the Nikon based partially on my luck with the company for its 35mm cameras, and partially because the uploading seemed simple.  Overall, the Nikon delivers some nice pictures and is not too hard to use.  Our camera experiences are pretty much confined to recreational use or at family gatherings, so I can not give expert commentary on some of the advanced features.  Given that, however, I would recommend this if you are interested in getting a digital camera and do not want to spend a lot of time learning how to use it.

The biggest snag I encountered was installing the software to upload the photos.  Being somewhat limited in computer memory, I decided to not install the full complement of programs and I think it got me into trouble.  After installing the main program itself, it took me quite awhile to discover that I had not installed all the drivers necessary to make the program work.  Unfortunately, it got to be more complicated than just re-installing the program from scratch and it was difficult to find out and fix which items needed to be re-configured.  After an hour or so, though, I was finally up and running.  Once that was over, it was extremely easy to upload the camera's photos and a big improvement on the Kodak we have at work.

The camera itself has a lot of options that I find confusing, and it took some practice before I figured out how to do some of the simpler processes like red eye reduction and even learning how to delete the memory.  Not exactly point and shoot, but I am gradually getting the hang of it.  The picture quality, however, was better than I expected and much better than the older digital photos I have seen.  You really do need two additional items, an extra battery and a bigger memory card.  You get around 16 photos in the default mode (less than 10 in high quality) and the batteries fade rather quickly.  We plan to use this on vacation, so when there is not a computer around to constantly dump your work you could be packing the camera away after day one of the trip.

Not being totally up to date on technology, I thought our printer (HP colorjet) would be fine for printing as well.  While everything looked great on the screen, I quickly found our printer produced grainy images.  A quick trip to work and the laser printer later, it was easy to see that the camera was fine and my colorjet printer was to blame.  After spending several hundred on the camera, I am a bit ashamed to admit I did not think ahead about getting a better printer.  That may be the next purchase on my list, as I really am beginning to like the ease of the Nikon and like the convenience of being able to digitally delete any photos I don't like right on the spot.
