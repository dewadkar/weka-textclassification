            I received this awesome car as a gift for graduating college.  I saw it on the road and it looked so different from every car out there.  But I thought it would be just another sports car with no practical use.  Until I took a test drive.  The interior is almost futuristic.  The seat covers come off so you can clean them.  It comes equipped with a CD player, tape deck, and AM/FM radio.  There's plenty of leg room in the back for 2 passengers.  The seats are comfortable (I'm stuck in traffic everyday on my way to work and I can never complain of lack of comfort!).  There's ample compartments to put stuff in.  For example, above the radio is a big compartment to fit tapes and my cell phone charger.  You really don't realize the practicality of this until you actually start using the car. It gives great gas mileage (about 350-375 miles on one tank of gas).  
The one thing that made me fall in love with this car all over again happened just recently.   We received about one and half feet of snow and after digging my car out and my roommate's Jetta, my car handled better than hers!  
This car is great for single people who wouldn't be driving lots people.  But I have to say, one time, my cousin and her one year old son road in my car with a car seat and ride was fine.
A definite buy!<br><br>
