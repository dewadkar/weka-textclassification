            I'll confess.  I am an ex-hippy groupie.  Always yearned for the freedom but lacked the courage.  Thanks to Honda, I am a free bird!
My old Honda Accord had to go; so I trudged into the showroom confident that I was going to be arguing price over a new Honda Accord.  But then, this joyous SUV said &quot;Drive me...I will make you feel young &amp; sporty again.  You can pretend you could go to the Amazon, hike the Grand Canyon and surf the big ones before breakfast.&quot;  Okay, I was hooked.  I bought (and it was cheaper than the Accord!) and waited for reality.
Reality has been held at bay.  I simply LOVE driving this car.
So far I have had no maintenance issues and only 2 small complaints.  #1--I had to pay to have a passenger arm rest &amp; #2 the passenger doesn't have an automatic door unlock/lock feature.  Well, I suppose #3 would be that the hatch opens sideways which can be awkward in tight parking &amp; garage spaces.<br><br>
