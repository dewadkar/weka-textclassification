            For the longest time I've wanted a convertible automobile.  To me there was always an alluring mystique about owning one.  I would imagine myself cruising down the highway with the top down, and nowhere in particular to go.  Just driving for the sake of getting away from it all on a beautiful warm sunny day.

Well, since I got the car forty-eight hours AFTER the official start of winter, I'll have to let you know the actual experience meets with my expectations.  Hopefully, there won't be record rainfall in the Northeast this coming spring.

The lease on my old car (1999 Acura CL 3.0) was ending in Mid-February 2002 and I had just begun to consider my choices for a new car.  I once again, fantasized about owning a convertible, but didn't give it any serious thought.  But then, I got a call from my cousin who works for Daimler Chrysler Corporation.  He asked if I was in the market for a new car, because Chrysler was running a purchase program to friends and extended family of employees.  Suddenly, the wheels starting turning in my head and to make a long story short...I ended up with a 2002 Sebring Convertible Limited for less than dealer invoice.

Anyway, I always thought a convertible was noisy and cold.  It's neither.  As a matter of fact I would say that the Sebring Convertible Limited is as quiet as my aforementioned Acura CL however, a strong wind can shake the cloth top considerably.  As far as being cold, the car is no colder than any other car I've owned, although the absence of heated seats with a leather interior does tend to wake you up in the morning.

Further, for the last fifteen years I�ve bought nothing but Japanese cars.  I always thought the fit and overall quality was superior to that of American cars.  Was I ever wrong, because Chrysler seems to be doing everything right.  The perceived quality of this car meets that of Japanese designed cars I�ve owned in the past (I use the word perceived only because I have no idea if this car will be as trouble free as the Japanese cars I�ve owned in the past).  The fit and function of all the different characteristics of this car are excellent.  The design is equally good with all controls and accessories well-placed and easy to see and use.

First, this car was designed as a convertible from the ground up.  Unlike its closest competition the Toyota Camry Solara SLE Convertible, this is not a 'used to be' coupe with the top chopped off.  As a matter of fact, a Sebring Coupe is equipped with a 3.0 liter Mitsubishi made engine, whereas this Convertible has a Chrysler 2.7 liter engine and shares no body parts as well.  This 'from the ground up' design mentality means that things like interior & trunk room and, support & stability are not byproducts of the top chopping process.  Therefore a car actually designed as a convertible from the get-go, is going to be a better convertible.

To say this car is not a head turner probably means you have a stiff neck.  It's gorgeous!  The 'Limited' edition, which I bought, comes with 16" shiny chrome wheels that put just the right finishing touch on the car's overall appearance.  The lines are smooth, flowing, and non-angular.  Gone are the days of the boxy LeBaron and Sebring Convertibles.

The 'Limited' Edition is available in only six exterior and two interior colors.  The interior colors are either Royal Blue Everything, or Cream/Royal Blue combination.  Initially I thought that the Cream/Royal Blue Combination was going to be an abortion until I saw it in person...it's beautiful.  Although I must say that the deep blue carpet shows every lint speck, and the cream-colored leather seats and door panels show every smudge.  Keeping the interior clean is going to be a job and a half.  Anyway, I ended up with the Deep Saffire Blue exterior, Dark Blue cloth top, and Cream/Royal Blue interior.  The combination is outstanding...especially with the top down.

I'm 6'0" tall and weigh a good 195 pounds and I have absolutely no trouble whatsoever with the amount of interior room.  The power adjustable driver's seat makes it very simple to find that perfect setting for even a big guy like me.  As a matter of fact, the last two cars I've owned I always had the seat all the way back but not so with this car.  As far as comfortable goes, this is probably the most comfortable car I've EVER owned.  The seats are plush but supportive.  I commute over 300 miles per week and have no complaints so far.

The interior instruments and other gadgets are well placed, easily read, and accessible.  If you are a smoker however (and I'm not anymore) the cigarette lighter and ashtray are both placed in an awkward position making their use rather difficult.  One notable and carefully thought out feature is the extra power outlet inside the armrest compartment for your cell phone...nifty!

The standard sound system is great.  Six Infinity speakers compliment the in-dash, four-CD changer and AM/FM stereo with 10 preset channels per band.  The stereo has a three band graphic equalizer (bass, mid, treble) more than most stock car audio products.  The only upgrade to the stereo adds a cassette player to the AM/FM/CD combination.  The sound is great; although it does have a somewhat overemphasized bass response.  But, for a standard system...it's more than adequate.

The ride is smooth as silk on a smooth road.  However, because of the extra body support needed in a convertible bumps and jitters in the road are somewhat magnified by the time they reach the interior.  The ride is also a little mushy in the sense that larger sharp ridges in the road make the car bounce and float as if it was 500 pounds heavier than it really is.  I have not experienced significant roll in tight cornering, as a matter of fact the car handles quite well and is really very solid.  The good cornering capabilities combined with the sensation of 'floating' over large road ridges is giving me the impression that this car has a dual personality...a luxury touring coupe that wants to be sporty as well.  But I think this impression is due to the fact that I'm going from a 'Sport Suspension' Acura CL to the 'Touring/Sport Suspension' Sebring Convertible.  More than likely it's something that I need to get used to, rather than a point to complain about.  However, a little 'back to the drawing board' needs to be done about the bumpiness of the ride.

Acceleration is equally as smooth using full automatic even when the pedal is dead on the floor.  The power of this car is adequate even though it's quite heavy.  Full acceleration is not 'neck-snapping', but it shouldn't leave you wanting a few extra horses under the hood either.  As a matter of fact, I have to exercise a lot of care because it's extremely easy to send this car past 90 mph and not realize it because of the ultra smooth ride.  

The Limited's standard "Auto-Stick" is fun for those times where you wish you had a standard transmission.  The "Auto-Stick" is basically an on-demand manual transmission without the clutch.  Think of it as 'Manual Lite'.  Shifting while in "Auto-Stick" is just a matter of a flick of the wrist.  The smart "Auto-Stick" will not let you down-shift if you're going too fast, and will automatically shift into a higher gear if you hit the redline on the tachometer.  Although fun, I have forgotten that I was in "Auto-Stick" on several occasions where it was necessary for the car to be in a lower gear (ie. leaving a toll booth).  But, these little setbacks aside...I still think it's a fun thing to have.  Plus, switching back to full automatic in heavy traffic is a blessing as well.

The full list of standard features will leave you wanting little else in the way of extras.  However, the full size spare tire and radio upgrade were extras I'm glad the car the dealership had in stock had installed.  In addition to everything I mentioned, I also added a windscreen, wheel locks, bag hooks (neat little things that are installed in the trunk for hanging plastic grocery bags from), and a cargo net.  What's missing that I'd like to see in future models, are automatic climate control and steering wheel mounted stereo controls.  Not necessities by any stretch of the imagination, but extras you REALLY appreciate when you don't have them.

Lastly, the top.  A flip of two levers and a press on a button send all four windows and the convertible top down.  Total time to that feeling of freedom...less than one minute.  Next, you install the color coordinated top boot cover for that finished look and you�re set to go.  Putting the top up is almost equally as easy although quite a bit of effort is needed to grab the handle and pull the top to it's locking position.  By the way, a beautiful as you think the car is with the top up, double that when you put the top down.  That Cream/Blue interior against the Saffire Blue exterior is stunning.

<b>Features I Really Like:</b>

Well, there you have it in a great big nutshell.  If I had to sum it all up I'd have to say that this is probably around the nicest car that I've owned thus far.  It's got all the features you could possibly want in a car, and the apparent quality is as good as my previously owned Japanese imports (Acura, Honda, Nissan, and Subaru).
