            I am so happy with my '98 Toyota Tacoma!  As this is my first pick-up, I don't really have anything to compare it to except other cars and my husband's Jeep Cherokee (which is a piece of junk!).
  
I have had my Tacoma for five years now and haven't had a single problem with it.  It's extended cab is great for groceries and small people.

The gas mileage is comparable to a car at about 30 miles to the gallon.  Of course with its overdrive button, it does just as well on the highway, gas wise.  I do wish it had a little better pick up, though.  No pun intended.  Ha, ha!
The paint looks like brand new except where some careless people have dinged it in parking lots.  

I live in Florida so A/C is a very important feature for me.  This baby has super cool air and it cools down in seconds even though my truck is black!

I have changed the oil religiously and had to change out the battery last year.  My husband put on larger tires and really nice rims last year too.  The new wheels make my Tacoma look really hot compared to the factory wheels!  However, in the rain I have to be pretty careful since it can hydroplane with the light back end and wider tires.  
The overall handling is good, but not as great as a car.  Well, you might ask, what did you expect it's a pick-up?! 

 My Tacoma only has "Power help" steering and it can really be a pain to pull in or back out of a parking spot with it.  This feature took a bit getting used to for me since the only truck I've ever owned was a GMC Jimmy which had power steering.  But oh well!

Driving a truck is <b>not</b> like driving a car.  It handles differently and bumps are more noticeable.  If you have never owned a truck before, I recommend test driving a few to see how you like the feel.  Pick-up trucks are lighter in the rear end and don't hug the ground as nicely as a car.  And, as I have already mentioned, it can hydroplane when the ground is wet if you're not careful.

My husband and I travel from Tampa to North Carolina about once a year and we always bring my truck since his Jeep is a bucket of bolts.  I love sitting in the passenger seat since it leans really far back, (unless you have a bunch of stuff in the extended cab part).  It is comfortable enough for a long trip, but I wish mine came with cruise control.  My leg tends to get tired pressing on the gas so long! 

The interior is cloth with carpet covered floor mats.  I wish it would have come with plastic molded mats, since it is a truck.  The carpeted mats are hard to keep clean.  Also, the mat on the driver's side tended to get wrinkled up under the gas pedal/brake so I eventually just took the mat out.  

Another feature that I had tacked on was the bed liner.  I highly recommend getting one if you decide to buy any pick-up.  It has held up to a truckload of gravel, pavers, mulch, Christmas trees and much, much more!  My husband and I go camping and backpacking so my Tacoma really comes in handy to transport all of our gear too!  Our mountain bikes also fit well in the bed of the truck.
 
I did not opt for the power windows and locks on my truck since it only has two doors,  and I really didn't deem it a necessary feature.   

The radio/tape cassette player work great.  Again, no frills here with a CD player.  

Well, I hope this helps someone to make their decision!  I certainly do <b>love</b> mine!
