            The automatic gearbox in our 2.0L 1981 Saab finally gave up so we needed a new car. Fuel consumption didn`t figure high on our list since the Saab hadn`t done better than 20mpg for years and was using oil at a similar rate. We didn`t have many ideas on what we wanted beyond: a) An automatic; b) Something that didn`t look like a Ford Sierra. In England, "b" is a tough one because nearly all cars look like Ford Sierras. We looked at a lot of cars (90% of them looking astonishingly similar to a Ford Sierra) before we saw a white "What the hell`s THAT?" The "What the hell`s that?" turned out to be a Honda Prelude (manual). Not many cars look like that here, especially that long horizontal front light array. Anyway, we liked it and set about finding an automatic.

To call the Prelude rare would be inaccurate, but there isn`t a plethora of them either. There are less automatics. The VTEC automatic wasn`t officially available here. We found one but it was a bit overpriced and we heard there might be problems getting Honda garages to service them. If they would service them, they might need imported parts from time to time. That pretty much ruled out the VTEC, as far as we were concerned. It took us another 6 weeks to find an automatic for sale at a reputable dealer`s. We told the guy "We want it." on the phone, even before we`d discovered its one previous owner had only done 4,500 miles in the 2 years `n` 4 months that he`d owned it. Shortly thereafter, we `persuaded` our Saab into gear and set off to look at and test drive the Prelude.

It was a Bordeaux Red 2.0i. It was in very good condition visibly and, more importantly, in the opinion of a mechanic friend we took with us. It didn`t have the optional rear spoiler fitted (no, they`re not fitted as standard) but if you`re about to spend �13,000 an additional �400 doesn`t seem so bad. If you look at the Prelude with and without the rear spoiler I`m sure you`ll agree it needs it. It`s not quite right without it. My girlfriend then took it out on the road. When she came back, she WANTED it! (You thought your g/f was the only one that wouldn`t be pacified with a 900cc `shopping basket`? Think again.) That was settled then. Told them to fit the spoiler and we`d come get it.

A week later and we were Prelude owners. It`s a fast car. Push the `Sports Mode` button on the (auto) gear-shift and it`s an EVEN FASTER car. With its wide tyres, low center of gravity and firm double-wishbone suspension, it goes round bends fast too. The bucket-like seats hold you well so it never really seems like you`re going fast; everyone else is just going too slow. Almost glad we didn`t pay the extra for the inherent risks of the faster VTEC, the 2.0i is plenty quick enough. Fast and comfortable is almost all you need to know about the Prelude, except:

Between 125 & 130mph (which we wouldn`t dream of doing) a rev limiter cuts in. What should cut in is ANOTHER GEAR because the engine would easily crank a smaller cog. It could`ve been a 145mph car with the addition of a 5th gear.

Ours being without any optional extras when we bought it, the road noise from those wide tires was a tad on the excessive side. This was easily cured with the addition of 4 fitted (Honda) mats. Two large for the front, two handkerchief-sized for the back.

About that back. Those seats are every bit as comfortable as the front ones. If you (the driver) are 6` tall then it`ll be a struggle for ANYONE to sit behind you. My g/f is 5` 3" and I can easily sit behind her. My feet go under her seat but other than not being able to stretch my legs it`s comfortable back there. You can probably get 2 people on the passenger side (front and back) if their average height isn`t above 5` 10". Having said that, only a fool would buy it as a `family car`.It`ll suffice for taking kids to school and for short lifts for friends. Otherwise, LET `EM WALK! You don`t want people in the back of your car whining about leg room and slowing you down.

Somebody didn`t like the dashboard. My g/f is a Star Trek fan; she likes it. Each to their own I guess.

That big, almost horizontal, front windscreen (windshield) lets in a LOT of sun. Coupled with the black dashboard it can get pretty warm inside the Prelude in the summer. Avoid traffic or get the air-conditioning is my advice.

You`ll be surprised how big the boot (rear trunk) is. I`ve seen smaller ones on more conventional family saloons.

Finally, its only real fault (and it really isn`t that bad): Not sure how it does it, but when driving in fog or drizzle at night a part of the headlight beam reflects straight up! It doesn`t stop you seeing up the road but it is a bit of a distraction to begin with. Once you get used to it it`s like it wasn`t even there. On clear nights you won`t notice it.
