            When I first got my 1997 Maxima, I had to stop in at my local mechanic to pick up a friend and my mechanic told me I'd never have a problem with the Maxima. He said they are among the most reliable cars on the road. After owning the Maxima for 3 yrs and not having one single thing break on the car for those 3 yrs and 42,000 miles, I have to agree!
I mean NOTHING needed to be fixed. Not one knob, button, part. I just changed the oil every 3,000 miles and got the required tune-ups according to the owner's manual. I almost wish I had bought it rather than leased, but at the time, I needed a good car and didn't have the down payment to buy. For $299/month and no money down, it was a pretty good lease deal. 

The Maxima is fast. Very fast. It accelerates quickly and gets you up over the speed limit before you realize it. There's plenty of room for the family and the interior is well thought out. The trunk has a lousy design though, with the arms from the trunk lid intruding into the compartment when the lid is closed. Watch for crushed packages!

Another thing I never cared for is the suspension. It feels fine on a smooth road, and there is little body roll due to the use of anti-sway bars. But once you go over rough pavement, it loses composure, much more than you would expect from a $25,000 import sedan.  In this regard, BMW and Lexus have nothing to worry about.  The Maxima jiggles, wobbles and shakes uncomfortably on even moderately bumpy roads.  Perhaps this has been corrected on the new generation Maxima. 

If you want reliable, fast, fairly roomy transportation, the 1997 Maxima fits the bill. Just hold on to your hat when the "going gets rough".
