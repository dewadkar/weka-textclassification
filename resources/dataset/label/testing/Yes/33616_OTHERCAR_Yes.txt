            If you are looking for a good used pick-up, consider the 1994 Toyota Xtracab.  I bought mine new, still have it and still love it.  I needed an automatic and opted for the V6 because the 4-cylinder automatic was a little wimpy around Seattle's hills.  I also got the 2-wheel drive model.  It drives pretty much like a car, and is fairly comfortable.  I also like the ECT (electronically controlled transmission), a handy feature again if you live in a hilly area. It does well on the highway, and also in the city. I-5 in Seattle rarely moves faster than 5 mph (seemingly...)and even on the hottest days this truck keeps cool in long, slow commutes.  The only &quot;surprise&quot; was needing a new starter around 44K miles.  I also had to replace the back bumper after barely nudging another car in a parking lot --- and the old Pinto I backed into hardly showed a scratch! Also, a bolt holding the sway bar on broke off after driving over a small pothole.  Bear in mind this is not a &quot;tough&quot; truck -- you can't go driving through rocky creek beds like they show on the commercials.  This is an &quot;urban&quot; pick-up that's great for trips to the lumber store and the like, but in my opinion is not a real &quot;workhorse.&quot;  My old '58 Buick was a heck of a lot tougher, but in general, this is a very reliable, good running truck.  There was head gasket recall for the V6 around 1998, so check to see if it was done. <br><br>
