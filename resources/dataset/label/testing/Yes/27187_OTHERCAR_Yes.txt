            I've owned British cars in one form or another for over 15 years, and always wanted to settle down with a nice v-12 XJS.  Despite the horror stories you will hear, the cars are a dream to drive.

I won't lovingly drone on, but I will give prospective owners some tips:

#1. Go to Kirby Palm's website and download a helper manual for free: http://www.nettally.com/palmk/Jaguar.html - This is going to be your bible for ownership of the car!

#2. This resounds with most used car purchases but is extremely pertinent with the XJS. Buy the best example you can!  How? First, stay away from EBay auctions and the sort.  Instead find your local Jaguar club, or search Jaguar enthusiast sites.  These are the people who know the cars, and can provide loads of information.

#3. If you want to gas up and go, then read no further.  Jaguars, and all classic sports cars are not for you.  They are labours of love and are not simply transportation that makes you look good or helps you to go fast.

#4. Test drive alot of them.  This will help give you a feel for how different each one can be.  Also, try to drive one that you know you could never afford and that is in great shape.  This will give you a idea of how things should/could be.

#5.  Remember the following "Anyone can buy a Jaguar, but few people can own one."  If you plan on spending $5,000 on an XJS, be aware that this is pennies compared to the cost of ownership.  For example, an ECU will be $800 and may only last a year.  To replace the gas tank could cost as much as $1500.  Repairs to the rear brake calipers will be over $2000, as they are a unique system and the rear axle must be dropped to get to them.  The dual exhaust is tough to get and I don't car to remember how much it costs to replace bothe sides.  You can spend multiples of the cars purchase price in three to four short years.  So have extra money and lots of it.

#6. If you live in a state with tough emissions laws (Va., Ct.) then ,make sure that the car will pass BEFORE you buy it.  It can take many many months for even the best technician to try to get those spitting hydrocarbons within regulation.  One year it took me 6 months and thousands of dollars to get it right.

#7.Be aware that either you will get a good one or a neglected one.  If you get a neglected one, you will know it soon.  If repairs come quick and costly, then you are in for a battle.  So either be prepped to stay in the battle or just fold.

#8.  Call other Jag owners, they will give you the scoop.

#9. The 85's are generally good, and the engines are bullet proof IF they have not been overheated.  They will really surprise you with the speed!

#10.  Take your time in buying one and you will most likely come away with a classic which you will admire each time you step in or out of it. It will make you feel wonderful on long cross-country stretches of road, and on nice windy roads as well.  It is extremely fast when running right, so be prepared!!
