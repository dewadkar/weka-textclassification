            We all know the pros and cons of the current Jeep Wrangler. It's noisier than most other vehicles. It rides worse than a car. It doesn't have seat heaters...The list could go on and on about how this is not a proper vehicle for 2001. So consider the pros. It's a convertible off-road capable vehicle. It rides as well as any other pick up truck. The new for 2001 model year soft top is much quieter than previous models. The 6 cylinder engine is bulletproof and will last forever.

Contrary to popular opinion the AC and heater work quite well no matter what the weather and the top doesn't leak. It is a joy to run around with the top down. You can get a hard top or the option with both tops. The hard top is available with defroster and window wiper/washer. 

The wrangler handles reasonably well on the road and in the snow. You just can't drive it like it's a sports car. It handles as well as any other truck. It does have a tighter turning radius than other trucks so that helps out a lot in city driving and off-road.

The interior is not as posh as some of the nicer cars out there but it isn't bad for a vehicle that might get rained in if you forget to put the top up. It even has drain plugs in the floor for those occasions. If you want some extra help with noise control or don't want to deal with the detachable plastic windows go with the full steel doors. Contrary to other reviewers I don't feel the interior is of 1950s vintage. It is as good or better than most vehicles in this price range from the late 80s or even early 90s. It is certainly on par with the last generation (not the latest generation mind you) of pickup trucks.

My Jeep has been pretty reliable with only a couple trips to the dealer in over a year. None of my few problems made the vehicle immobile. For 2001 child seat anchors were added behind the rear seat as well so kids can ride in the back and utilize the newer child safety seats. The roll cage will protect the occupants in an accident too. This jeep has done reasonably well in crash tests. I believe it received 4 stars in the Federal crash test. 

Despite all this the Wrangler is not for everyone. Some people prefer the posh interior and ride of a car. However, for those that need to go off-road on a regular basis there is no other choice with the demise of the Cherokee. Those that appreciate the looks and can live without 21st century interiors will find this to be a good vehicle. The bottom line though is that you have to want the convertibility, off-road ability, or the looks for this vehicle to appeal to you.
