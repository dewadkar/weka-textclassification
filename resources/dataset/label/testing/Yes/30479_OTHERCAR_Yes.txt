<TEXT>
            I bought my first car about a year and a half ago, an 88 Corolla. I just love it. It's had no major mechanical problems, still drives great, shifts smoothly and is phenomenal on gas, about 35-40 miles per gallon. It's quieter than my parents' newer cars. My mother would rather drive my car than her 92 colt.  I've put almost 30000 miles on it since I got it and it's never given me any problems. The body and interior are still in great shape, nobody believes the car is almost twelve years old. I will definitely stick with toyota for my next car, if I can bear to give this one up.<br><br>
