            Ive owned 2 Toyotas.  They both were 4Runners.  One was an '85 with over 200,000 miles and the other was a '91 with over 100,000 miles.  I loved both of these vehicles.  They rode nice and were as dependable as the sunrise.
However they were not perfect.  The 85' has a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine that was extremely underpowered.  It was so slow I doubt it could have gotten out of its own way.  The '91 was better with its 3.0L V6, but it still lacked under the hood.  Overall though, I was a tried and true believer in Toyotas.
When I first read about the Tundra I thought, "finally, Toyota is going make a truck that will shake up the American truck market."
So I went and test drove a Tundra.  It was a very nice truck.  It rode smoothly and looked good.  Its a bit early to say how the Tundra's dependability will be, considering Toyota's reputation Im sure it will prove to be just as dependable as any other full-size truck.
I only had 2 major complaints with the Tundra.  First of all, its not a full-size truck.  Its shorter and narrower.  Also, the Tundra I drove was lacking in the engine department.  I realize its a Toyota, and they have never really been known for great power.  In my opinion, when you have a V8, it should respond instantly when you hit the gas.
After I drove the Tundra, I went and drove the other 3 trucks.  I drove an F-150, a Silverado and a Ram.  
Of the 4, I liked the F-150 the best.  The Ram and Silverado were both nice, but the F-150 just had something about it.
Personally, I think the Tundra could be a great truck.  Its already a good truck, but its no F-150.  First of all, it needs a bigger engine the the 4.7L V8.  Dont get me wrong, the 4.7 is good, but it doesnt respond like a Ford 5.4L or a Chevy 6.0L does.  
Also, the Tundra needs the option of an 8-foot box.
Dont get me wrong, Im all for Toyota.  When the day comes that Toyota makes a truck that can match the F-150, I'll be the first person to buy one.  Untill that day comes, however, I'll keep my Fords.
