            I rented this car on a trip from Maryland to Vermont.  What a great time!  The one I got was the 4.0L V8 model, with just over 280 horsepower, and about the same amount of torque.  I drove it on the interstate, on windy mountain roads, and on various gravel and dirt roads.  It was very comfortable on all of them.  

It was also very sporty; let's just say I treated it like a rented car.  It was pretty quick for a four-door, and the computer-controlled active suspension made for great handling and an all-around safe feeling.

There were, however, a couple of problems.  For example, the gas mileage was an issue.  I realize V8s aren't known for fuel efficiency, but this thing wasn't making enough power or torque to justify getting about 23 MPG on the highway, especially with a 5-speed.  Since this car is now made by the Ford Motor Company, they should use the 290 horsepower, 4.6L V8 that they used in the Mark VIII.  It made slightly more power, and I got 25-26 MPG on the exact same roads.  And that was with a 4-speed.

Also, the issue of roominess.  I'm about 5'11, 200 lbs., and I felt slightly cramped up in this vehicle.  I wasn't uncomfortable by any means, but I've been in a few roomier sedans.  Also, woe be to any adult who would've had to sit behind me, with my seat as far back as possible.  

Overall, it was a nice car.  Perfect for little people with lots of money.  Good job, UK!
