            Looking for a great SUV that has the best ride?  Look no further, the RX300 is a gem.  I needed an SUV, but most of all a roof rack to get my windsurfing gear to where the wind was blowing.  I checked out all the upper level SUV's; Mercedes, Lexus, and yes, even the Grand Cherokee and the Toyota Land Cruiser.  The RX300 won my purchase because it was easy to handle on the highway, got the best gas mileage of the finalists, and it had the luxury of a quiet, smooth ride.  Plus, I like the quick acceleration.  If you plan to spend more time off road than on then maybe some other choice is better.  However, if you plan to spend most of the time on the highway then you will not go wrong with the RX300.

This vehicle has all the sound system you want.  It is very well laid out with easy handling, fold-down rear seats.  About the only thing I would add would be a navigation system with a satellite GPS unit.  As for looks, its a sporty thing that draws a second and then a third look everywhere you go.  

All in all, I am a very satisfied buyer because the RX300 is everything I wanted and even though it is a Lexus, the cost is surprisingly less than one would think.  It is also one SUV that gets parked up front at the country club.
