            The Olympus D-450 Zoom impressed my parents so much with the great reviews that it got, that they decided to invest in one, so we could get pictures to our PCs with much more ease.  Saving time and money on developing costs didn't hurt either, I suppose.  We've had our camera for about half a year, and don't have any complaints!  Well, maybe a few, but they are our own fault for not knowing what buttons do what : )

I won't be able to tell you all the stats on the camera, because I really don't know them, and frankly, I don't care about them either.  Numbers and big words don't mean much to me, seeing the quality pictures, and ease of use is enough to sell me on this camera.  The beauty of the popularity of digital cameras is driving prices down, always good for the consumer.

There are so many features on this camera, I don't even know where to start.  In fact, I don't know 90% of the features, so I won't even bother trying to list them.  I know that there are multiple resolutions you can shoot your pics at, the whole range of resolutions looks nice.  We got a floppy adapter for our smart media card, and it works really well.

My parents loved their camera so much that they decided to buy one for me for my graduation present.  Actually, we're going halfies, but I don't care because digital cameras are so nice to have.  You don't know how convenient they are until you own one, and think to yourself &quot;I can do that now!&quot;

This camera may not be the best for people who just want to take pictures to send through e-mail, and don't really care about the quality of the photos.  This camera may be a little high-end for those types, but will definitely even suit their needs.  If you're in the market for a digital camera, I suggest you get this one.  Whether you're an amature, or a professional photographer, you will appreciate this camera and swear by it like so many people do!<br><br>
