            If you want a small sexy camera which takes great photos this has to be the one. The trade-off is a lack of pro-features (manual focusing, exposure etc) but I for one find all this much easier and quicker to do with imaging software. If you want to overcome this cameras few shortcomings look at the new Canon Pro90 - its a better but much bigger camera.

A few words on some of the issues

1. Image quality is quite outstanding - Amazing given size of lens (which has a neat electronic cover when switched off). I think the quality of photos is much  better than any non-SLR film based camera (particularly APS).

2. Battery life at 80 mins is NOT short by current standards and infolithium provides v.useful 'minutes of battery life left' reading. You should definitely buy an extra battery with this camera.

3. LCD is extremely bright and useable even in bright sunshine - much better than most competitors.

4. Focusing time is relatively slow (about 1.2 seconds) and there is 'above average shutter delay (about 0.4 seconds). This partly reflects the fact that the camera's lens has to be slow given its size and the compact nature of the camera.

5. Flash is fairly weak and no hot-shoe. Doesnt bother me very much as you cannot really take great photos with an in-built flash. Good enough for fill-in and snapshots.

6. 8 mb memory stick is pathetic. So buy the 64mb stick and take around 50 photos at maximum resolution.

7. User interface with PC is very easy - when attached  the DSC-P1 becomes a 'removeable drive'. Only USB connection - no serial (but dont buy a camera with mega-pixel resolution and connect toa serial port....the port is just too slow).
