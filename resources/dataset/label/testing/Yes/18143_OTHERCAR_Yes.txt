            I never wanted to drive a minivan, but with 4 small children, it's really a necessity.  We bought a Nissan Quest 4 years ago, and I love it!  We bought it used, it had been leased for 2 years before we bought it.

the Quest is the exact same van as the Ford Villager, if you open the front drivers side door it says &quot;manufactured by ford motor company&quot;.  But it is thousands cheaper, and the Nissan engine runs forever!

In the 4 years we have had it, we have not needed to do anything but basic maintenance.  We have over 80,000 miles on it now, and have never had one problem.

This van handles well in the snow, is small and easy to drive, and has plenty of room for car seats (we've had 3 car seats at one time and there was still room for other passengers).

The back, behind the seats, has plenty of room for a double stroller and still a few groceries.

When we buy a new car next year, we will definitely be looking at the Quests again!
