            The Toyota Corolla is one of the best selling cars in the world.  Reason?  It offers excellent fuel economy, and a smooth, comfortable ride.  Toyota Corolla combines excellent build quality with a smooth ride, quiet interior, and excellent gas mileage.

This review of mine is on new Toyota Corolla 2003 model and not the old model of this year or any other previous makes. This new model has an improved design, better than older Toyota models. Has automatic transmission and drives well than Focus.

It is a very common sight to see Toyota Corolla 2003 on the roads here in Canada.  Seems like, suddenly people have developed an interest for this economy car, which gives a comfortable ride as well.

2003 Toyota Corolla offers more of everything, including size, features, and a lot more finesse.  It is economical, has a sophisticated decent-look and more interior room.
The exterior body style of Toyota Corolla is updated from 2002 model.  It is much sportier now and looks like a small Camry.  We traded our old Dodge Spirit 1993 model and got this new one!  This car comes in black, maroon and titanium colors.  What we have is titanium colored.  It is silvery white and looks quite nice and compact.

  Actually, it is a compact car from Toyota. Though it is a compact car, you�ll get a mid-size feel.  It doesn�t look very small. It's bigger inside with considerably more rear legroom and a bit wider, so the front seats are farther apart. The wheels are slightly bigger, and the seats are higher off the ground.  It's also taller, and is now larger than the Honda Civic.  The manufacturers say that it has been created that way, keeping the present younger generation in their minds, who are quite taller than the previous generation.

Not only is the new Corolla roomier, but you will also feel the Camry influence once you get in.  I found the seats to be more comfortable and supportive and it has a richer-feeling than any of its predecessors that I have driven.  The rear seats are comfortable as well.  They have good room for two or three  adults and two kids, and a generous 13.6 cubic feet of cargo space.  This is another impressive feature of this latest model. 

Corolla has a pretty good sound system, and other neat features like outdoor temperature gauge, key-less entry, and a spacious center compartment to fit all the cds.
Currently, according to many magazines here, the Corolla is the second best made small car in America, right after the Toyota Echo (third place is the Chrysler PT Cruiser).Handling has been improved quite a bit, with modern new shocks that tighten up more as they reach full compression, and road stability is higher. 

Engine is a little too loud.  That�s the only drawback we found with this car.  It could use a little more power.  That�s what I feel.  Otherwise, the car is okay.  Hope they rectify this problem, with the next model they make.

I can say this car handles well giving the driver a feel of the road.  Moreover, the comfort at highway speeds makes this vehicle a good choice.  I really believe that you can't get a better automatic-transmission small car than this Toyota Corolla!  You get smooth ride for a small car.  I enjoy driving this car and feel very safe and good at the same time!

The bottom line is, Toyota Corolla is a good economical car that is easy on the wallet. Needs more power and could be more quiet, but other than that, it�s a decent car for your basic transportation needs. So many people have complimented on this car so far!

So, folks, if you are looking for a practical, pleasantly styled, economical set of wheels, this is the car for you.  A reliable car, from a reliable maker!  It�s a real fun to drive this car.  All in all, this is a great looking car that drives very well.
