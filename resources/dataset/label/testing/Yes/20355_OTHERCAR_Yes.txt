               <b>T</b>he ultra stylish, quad cam, 32 valve, V8 powered Mark VIII not only carried on the pioneering work of the Mark VII (the car that started Lincoln's assault against luxury imports) It took it onto a totally new level.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

          <b>R</b>emarkably, slowing the steering for the final version actually improved the feel of this big Lincoln. With less than 3.0 turns lock to lock it tended to dart around on lock, but by making it much more stable, it allows drivers to enjoy a mix of good handling and a supple, air-cushioned ride so common with Lincolns. The refined V8 gives enough power to make the mark VIII really get up and go. Moving its large mass to 60 MPH in a little less than 7 seconds takes plenty of horsepower and torque. 290 horsepower and 285lb-ft of torque according to Ford.

       <b>T</b>hough not as torquey as the OHV 5.0 liter pushrod V8, the DOHC 4.6 liter unit gained a favorable reputation for this car and for good reason. This engine is part of Ford's Modular V8 family, also found in the Mustang Cobra, and has both the block and heads made in alloy. Also there are 4 valves per cylinder rather than 2. They are opened via four overhead camshafts. With electronic fuel injection and a fairly high 9:8:1 compression ratio, power output is 290hp, and an equally impressive 285lb-ft of torque is offered for excellent hill climbing.

    <b>A</b>lthough it was based on the front engined- rear wheel drive Ford Thunderbird, introduced shortly before it, there are significant  differences between the Mark VIII and the less powerful T-Bird. The Lincoln shares the same 113" wheelbase, but the car is 9" longer overall. Both cars use the same Four-speed automatic transmission, and vented disc brakes with ABS.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>     

  The <b>interior</b> of the Mark VIII is 'super' luxurious, amenities include An 8 speaker JBL sound system, keyless entry, power doorlocks, windows, and antenna, puddle lights that light up when you take a step out of your mark VIII to show you if there is ice, or a big mudd puddle near your feet. There is also automatic headlamps, and very easy to use ergonomics. The futuristic , wrap-around interior front dash fascia design incorporates driver and passenger airbags.


<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

   The <b>exterior</b> is 'one in a million', no other car looks like the mark VIII 2 door coupe. The Mark VIII has an alloy hood, neon rear lights, an updated traditional Lincoln grille, and HID lights. I personally love this design, I don't understand why FOMOCO let go of this car.


<i>Pricing:</i>

    The <b>price</b> is very low for many early models of the Mark VIII, I have seen 1992 models in the paper for as low as $8,000, for 1998 you probably are looking at a $16,000-$20,000 price tag. The 1998 Mark VIII went for a little under $40,000 when it was new.

 I can not comment on how reliable this car has been for me, but my Grandfather has had his since 1998 and he has put on a whopping 32,000 miles (god knows if it was my car it would have a million miles on it by now) anyway he has never had it in the shop other than for service.
