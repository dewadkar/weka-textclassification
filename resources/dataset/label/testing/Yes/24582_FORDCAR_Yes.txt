            My ex-boyfriend gave my car the name, because it really has some pick-up and can get around traffic fairly easily. (It's the V6 model) I put on about 20K mi per year on this car, and I've used it for several 6 1/2-7 hour road trips. My roommate, who usually travels with me, and I fair just fine in the vehicle. It does exactly what I need it to do, and I feel like I kinda float while I'm in it. 

When I first got this car, I used to drive for an extra 2 or 3 hours every day, just because I loved the way it felt. For a small car, it feels incredibly solid. I had no idea just how solid it was until I was loaned a Ford Escort from the dealer while I took my car in for recalls (4). I kinda procrastinated on them - I think I got 1 a year or something like that. When I got into the Escort, I felt like I was driving around in an oversized coke can.

For the first 60K miles, I was totally in love with this car. Absolutely nothing went wrong with it, aside from a cracked battery. I drive through the city a lot, and between all the construction and potholes, well, problems that would be caused by hitting a pothole or a steel plate the wrong way wouldn't surprise me. But ever since the battery cracked, my coolant gauge just stays on till the car warms up, regardless if it's low or not.

I saw that another person complained that the latch on the gas door didn't work. Mine froze during an ice storm one year, and I had to break the latch on the door to be able to refuel. Since then I picked up a locking gas cap, and every so often, the gas door swings open when it feels like it.

Around the 75K mi. mark, my water pump went. Fortunately, I used synthetic oil (Mobil 1) since the first day, and although the car was overheating for the 15 min. ride back home from the mall, it started fine. Another woman in my office also has a Contour (I think hers is a 95) and she had the same problem. I wonder if this is just something that happens to Contours after 60K mi?

My CV joints are about to go next, I think. My father said that CV joints are just one of those things that go bad after rough driving, and I know I'm not the gentlest I could be with this car. My air conditioner stopped working last summer, but I think that's something really simple, like a hose fell off or something. I still get my hot and cold air from the defrost vents, but the main vents won't put out any air.

I just recently got a cell phone, but I can't plug it (or any other car appliance, i.e. laptop or CD player) into the cigarette lighter, because the entire lighter housing is shot and the dealer told me it would cost about $200 to fix it. (About the same price as fixing the gas door.)

I really do love this car, even with its....idiosyncracies. It's been pretty good till this year.

As of November 8, 2000: I had to take my car in for emissions testing/inspection. I had no idea what this entailed, and I wasn't sure what I'd have to do if the car failed. But as it turns out, I needed not worry - the people at the inspection station told me that my car didn't emit any fumes! So I'm good to go for another 2 years. I was very proud of my little car.

At this point, I'm not sure if I'd trade it in, which I originally said I would have done. I figure I'll just save up the money for having the engine replaced, once it needs it. I'd still like a sunroof, but I'm not sure if I want to cut my car open.<br><br>
