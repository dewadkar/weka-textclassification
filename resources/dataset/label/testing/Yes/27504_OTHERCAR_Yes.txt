            I purchased this camera last year from UBID for $169 and have had great results with the camera. I have even got my wife using it and she hates dealing with electronics!

The camera gives very good image quality and offers the user a variety of options with regard to the resolution choice. These choices (of course) alter the storage capacity of the flash media that the camera uses for storage. At maximum resolution, the storage is ~ 1mb per picture.

The camera is a little less "trendy" looking than some others out there and seems to resemble the old instamatic camers in the way it feels, but hey, it does a great job.

We have also purchased a number of flash media cards for the camera (64,16 and 96mb) and the camera comes with a 8mb card. Also included are the AC adapter, PC connection and video connection for a TV. I am actually able to display very good quality images on our 47 inch projection TV with this camera!!

I am not sure of the status of Polaroid at this time as a company so if such a matter concerns you, you may want to steer clear of this product. Otherwise I can offer no real substantive complaints about the item. Minor issues I have are the time it seems to take to save the picture to card to allow for another shot, the size of the viewfinder and the battery usage. 

If you get this camera or any other CF or Smartmedia based camera I would HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting the usb adapter for your media card. I bought a PNY 64mb CF card and got one free and it is a remarkable improvement in uploading your images. The USB adapter is recognized as a removable hard drive with your PC and you are able to simply drag and drop images into your PC folders (with windows XP)


For those interested the specs:;

� Highest optical image resolution: 1,792 x 1,200
� Sensor resolution (gross): 2.30 megapixels
� File types recorded: JPEG
� Compatible battery types: AA-size
� Optical zoom: 2.3X
� Included memory: 8MB CF Type I
 

I hope you find the review useful and enjoy digital imaging because it is really convenient for those that have PCs
