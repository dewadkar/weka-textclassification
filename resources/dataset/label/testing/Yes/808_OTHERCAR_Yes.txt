            My parents bought a 1992 Plymouth <i>Sundance</i> for me to use when I was a freshman in college, and it was a really great car for me for almost 5 years.  I drove it until I graduated, at which point I bought a new car. The Sundance served me so well that my younger brother, who is also a college student, asked my parents not to sell it, but to let him drive it. I actually didn't want to give it up...I wanted to buy it from my parents instead of getting a new car, but my brother needed it worse and didn't have a good job lined up like I did, so I let him have it.

In the 5 years I drove the car, I only had the car in the shop 1 time, outside regular maintenence.  I blew a head gasket on the car, but it was fixed in good time by my dealer, Don Flier Motors in Pacific, MO.  The car has run great ever since it was repaired.  

This car is not the roomiest, most powerful vehicle in the world, but if you don't drive around with more than 2 people in the car very often or for very long distances, it is a great option.  Also, I liked the trunk space, and when  the back seat was folded down, there was tons of room.  I once moved almost everything from my dorm room in 1 trip in this car.  (No furniture of course).  In my parent's opinion, the fact that the car is not a hot-rod power machine makes it a good first car for a teenager because it will get the person from point A to point B, but they won't be tempted to get in drag-racing contests with it.
