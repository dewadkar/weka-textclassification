            Our Mazda 323 (1993) had 260,000KM (1625000 miles) on it and when I took it into the shop - I received a list as long as my arm with all of the things that were wrong with it - that needed fixing.  This list totaled over $2000 - which was far too much to put into an old and abused car.  My wife and I decided it was time to look into getting a new one!

Well we decided that we could afford a used car for under $10,000.  What we found was irritation and confusion.  People and dealers just over value their used cars.  After a few weeks of total frustration - we decided to at least consider a new car.  

We decided to travel to all of the possible dealers that we could.  We tried all of the economy cars - from the Ford Focus, Toyota Echo, Honda Civic to the Kia Rio.  After several - I should say lots of trial runs and test drives - along with a few greasy car dealers, we narrowed the field to two cars.  The Honda Civic and the Mazda Protege.  Into the office we went to talk deal.  We got each of their best deals - and then compared.  Honda was willing to knock the price down only $200.  But Mazda gave us $1000 more towards our car as a trade in - so we took the deal.  

Thank goodness we took this deal.  This new Mazda has turned out to be the best buy we've ever made to date.  I handles great, is surprisingly fast for a 4 cylinder and has great pickup when you need to get going quickly.  There is a lot of room in such a small car as well.  The trunk is HUGE!  Oh and by the way - the mileage is also great 550km (350 miles)on the highway for under $30 ($20 US).  

There are some disappointments - basically it doesn't have leather interior (ha ha).  It actually isn't the most comfortable car in the world.  The gas pedals are a little high - so when you are on the highway for long periods of time - your leg really starts to hurt.  but as long as you do exercises - you'll have no problems!  

Lastly the price!  The price is great - I mean we only spent under $16,000 (note - we got power locks and a spoiler - which added to this cost by $1,200) - and with the super low financing (1.9) we have low monthly payments.  We also got a full 4 year 80,000 unlimited, bumper to bumper warranty.  The piece of mind knowing that my car won't break down at any moment is wonderful.  

If you are looking for a reliable and affordable car that is a pleasure to drive (with a pillow for long trips) then this is a car you should definitely consider.  

Note:  We've only had the car for 6 months - but we've had no problems yet - and (knock on wood) we hope that we won't have any in the future.  I'll let you know if we do!

Good luck car hunting - and have fun!
