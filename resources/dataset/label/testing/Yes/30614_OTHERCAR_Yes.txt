            General Motors has done a great job of distinguishing it's 4 domestic brands.  Oldsmobile has been cast as the domestic alternative to European makes such as BMW and/or Audi.  Remember the  generic Monte Carlo/Regal/Cutlass/Phoenix cars of the '80s?  Well those abominations are gone forever.  Thankfully GM has stopped selling the same car with 4 different names, sure many of todays cars share the same platform, but ultimately the spirit of each car is different.

The  Oldsmobile Aurora's European influence is noticeable right away.  The zig-zag pattern automatic shifter lends a bit of Jaguar flavor to the interior, as does the real wood on the dash.  The front and rear fog lights are also reminiscent of British brands.  Large analog gauges, with chrome rings around each add a sporty flair to the instrument cluster.  Seats are large and comfortable, the multi-function lumbar support is dream when spending long hours behind the wheel.  Rear seats are a little cramped considering the Aurora's price and size.  The Oldsmobile Aurora is not a small car,  and yet the rear seat passengers have less room than in the smaller, less expensive Maxima or Camry.  However, anyone in the back seat will enjoy their own heat and A/C vents, it is a luxury car after all. The Monsoon stereo sounds great.  Trunk room is adequate.  Everyone has come to expect power windows, but Aurora's seem quicker and quieter than most.

On the road the Oldsmobile is a strange combination of new and old.  The sporty handling is almost BMW like - it's fun to toss around corners.  The Overhead cam V-6 feels smooth and powerful (215 hp), Oldsmobile and Buick seem to have perfected the small V-6 the way Chevrolet perfected the small V-8 (Aurora is also available with a 4 litre V-8). 4-wheel disc brakes feel firm, and stop the car without much effort.  The main drawback of the Aurora is the way the powerful engine yanks the steering wheel to the right, and then to the left under heavy acceleration - it feels like a Cutlas Ciera from 1986.  The technical term is torque-steer, and it is very unnerving, especially in a car with sporting inclinations.  Long stretches of open road is where the Aurora really shines, the ride is smooth, and  compliant.  Road and engine noise are minimal.  I have always liked the trip computer which gives information such as, average speed, average fuel mileage, and range before needing to re-fuel.  This is a great car for a road trip.

Styling is like art - very subjective.  No one would call the Oldsmobile Aurora bold, but at least one person mistook it for a Lexus.  From the side one could possibly think the Aurora was a more expensive Japanese or European  brand, but the view from up front is all American.  The dual exhaust pipes out back are barely noticeable, but add a "concept car"  quality.  

Overall the 2001 Aurora is a good car - not great, but good.    The Aurora is a good looking, luxurious car with a bit of a sporty side.  The interior quality is excellent, ride is near perfect, and the engine is smooth and powerful.  If GM fixes the front end problems, the Aurora will be a serious contender in the pricey luxury/sport segment.
