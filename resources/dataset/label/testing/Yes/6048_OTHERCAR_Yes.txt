            All right its time for confessions! First, who among you has more than 5 roles of undeveloped film in their homes? Come on! You can tell me. I do!
Ok. Second, how old is it? No idea? Me either! Don't you just love when you finally breakdown and go and spend the God awful amount of money to have it developed and then find the pictures are 5 or 6 years old.
Well no more for this guy! I just got my new toy and boy do I love it!
I decided awhile back that I was tired of trying to take pictures of family functions and my daughter's sporting events and then taking the time to try and get the film developed. I then made up my mind that if a good deal on a digital camera came along I would take it. Well, a deal finally happened.
I purchased the RCA CDS1000 Digital Camera and I am in photo heaven.
It comes with all the necessary software and upgrades for your computer. All the attachments to hook it directly to your computer to download the images that are captured are provided. It has 2MB memory which allows 32 highly compressed images or 16 finer images to be taken. It has settings for automatic or if you are a more take control kind of person you can customize the setting for exposure and flash. It is very light weight. And get this, it even came with batteries!! Not cheap ones either, Duracell!! Also, it has the adaptor which allows you to plug it into a wall outlet so that you don't have to worry about wasting your batteries.
Also, and finally I guess, is my favorite feature. It has the connection to hook directly to a video jack on a monitor television so you can view the images immediately. And if you know me, you know I have no patience!!
Now you are probably asking(or maybe I overestimate my ability to hold your attention), how much? Would you believe I got it for $109? I think I got a heckuva deal. My brother does too. He is already begging his wife to get him one for Christmas!<br><br>
