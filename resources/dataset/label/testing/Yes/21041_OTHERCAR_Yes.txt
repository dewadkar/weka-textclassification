            When I bought my 94 Geo Tracker, I really didn't know what to expect. I had never owned this type of vehicle and had some trepidation about the safety and reliability of it.
Well, that was six years ago, and let me tell you something, I couldn't have made a wiser move. I use my vehicle EVERY DAY, and have not had ONE mechanical problem in all this time. Even now, when I pull up to a fast food restaurant takeout to order, the engine is still so quiet you can barely hear it running.
One note: I would recommend, however, ALWAYS using your seatbelts, because these type of vehicles are top-heavy and those canvas tops on the convertibles offer you a false sense of security.
Really, the only drawback to this vehicle is the bumpiness of the ride on rough roads. It will literally shake your teeth out if you hit a bad patch of highway. My advice:  slow down when you get to poor roads and keep on trucking in this super-reliable vehicle. I would like to own five of them.<br><br>
