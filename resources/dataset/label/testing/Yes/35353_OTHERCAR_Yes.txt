            My daughter turns sixteen in a few weeks.  I decided to buy her a car for her 16th birthday.
  After rejecting her request for a 60's era beetle or a 55
  Nash Metropolitan , we agreed on a Volvo.

  She originally opposed the idea but became entranced with the 850 after riding in the 94 850 I purchased the previous week.  For details see my review of  said 94.

  The car reviewed was actually the first one we looked at.
  We passed it over due to a serious scratch on the passenger door. The interior had a sweaty smell also.
 I don't know if that is what it was, but that is what I am going to call it.
  The door panel on the drivers side was loose also. I 
  am told Volvo uses a enviromentally friendly glue.
  I would expect that whatever the benifits to the envirnoment gained from the use of this glue was cancelled out by the fumes generated by the drive to the dealership to get it replaced.

  To continue.  I returned the first Volvo to the dealer for service items discovered and was offered this car as a
  loaner. I remarked that my daughter wanted a Volvo and I may want to purchase it.

 I noticed only on the drive home that it lacked a sunroof.
  I was crestfallen, thinking my daughter would'nt want it.

  But she was quite excited just the same . It is a bright red, and it is showroom nice. We went to the dealer the next day and closed the deal.
                      
                       Dealer
 The dealer is Volvo of Richardson.  They squawked some about having to spend so much on repairs. But I was very firm.  If I am going to trade in a mechanically PERFECT
  nineteen ninety EIGHT for a nineteen ninety FIVE, said 
  ninety FIVE shall be perfect as well.

  But I found a independent full service shop.
  DALLAS ELECT AUTO SERVICE
  13515 Method Street
  Dallas, Texas, 75243  972-644-4714

  These guys are really good. They are warranty certified.
  
   They save about HALF off dealer charges. They replaced the motor mount and the license plate bulb for 166.21.
 They haso have a waiting room with desks, phone , and computer terminals. If you are in the DFW area, you must check them out. You will bless my name if you do !

                       Power
  This unit is not a turbo.  But the power is more than adequate.  Most pleased.

                      Handling

  The turning radius is unbelievable small. I just love it.
  I can also seem to manuever into tight spaces more easily.

  I don't know where people get this stuff about this model being clumsy around corners. I have a sharp turn near my home and it hit the thing with no brakes , gunning the engine at the apex and I negotiate it easily. My passengers HATE that. 

                     Roominess

  How did they do it ?  This is not a large car. The trunk is huge, the interior is roomy and the hood is long.
 A wonderfully designed vehicle.

                     Control panel

  I dont spend much time in this car, but the controls are confusing. I sometimes manage to de-activate the interior lights. I don't like THAT. Considering my daughter will be driving it.
 So let me get this straight: You can not turn off the headlights, but you can turn off the interior lights.
 Weird.

   After years of having window and side mirror controls on
   the left door , having them on the console will take some getting used to. HOWEVER, I think not having them on the door ( SLAM !!) will extend their life.  Good thinking.

  The clock is located right in front of you. No taking your eyes off the road to look 2 feet down the dash.

                   Exterior - Paint

   I love the body style. Especially the grille.
   The paint is flawless. And seems to  of a exceptional quality.

   To me , a red Volvo is like a beige Porche. 
  I don't really feel this model lends itself to a bright red color. I also own a dark blue 94 and it is beautiful.
  Maybe it is just me. In any case the 2 cars compliement each other when sitting in the garage.
   
                    Seats-Interior

   This unit has cloth upholstery and no power seats.
   I can't say I really like the seat covers . Color grey, They look like they were put on wrong side out. 
   There is no wood grain. The interior does not compare to the 94, which is decked out to the nines. But it is sufficient. And it is very clean and nice.

  And this car is OH SO QUIET.  A coworker stood outside 
  and yelled my name several times and I never heard her.

                    Condition - History

  The car belonged to a Yuppie couple in Plano, Texas.
  It was obviously garaged, and very well maintained.
  There was a sheath of reciepts big enough to choke a moose
  in the glove box.
  The car was driven by the wife. She evidently didnt believe in going around pot-holes because I had to replace, mostly at dealers expense, all the rubber bushings and the front motor -mount. This caused the somewhat rattel-ly ride.
 Other than that , the unit was in top-notch condition.
  The dealer also repaired the scratch.

   After the bushings in the rear shocks, and the sway bar,
  and the top motor mount, and the FRONT motor mount were replaced, the ride can NOW be described as CREAMY. Best way to describe it. Of course, the new Michelins helped !

                    Other notes

  I was suspicious of the battery, which was  original equipment .  Sure enough , on the first cold snap it died.
  I replaced it with a INTERSTATE battery. Which I believe is the best.
  You want to keep a strong battery in this car, as it will be pulling the headlights while it is trying to start the engine.
  I also bought a PRESTONE "JUMP IT",and trained my daughter in it's use.  I used it to jump the car off to get it to the shop. It worked fine. DESPITE the fact that the battery for these cars has a ridge close to the positive terminal which makes attaching the jumper cable difficult.

  I like the fact that the engine, even though it has only 5
  cylinders, has a SIX quart oil capacity. This is the reason that oil changes are recommmended at 5000 instead of 3000 miles.




   I traded in a very nice 98 Mustang for this 95 850.
   The purpose was to protect my daughter. I will feel better 
   knowing she is in this unit, which is built like a tank.
   The auto is expendable. 

   
   As for the Yuppie wife, no doubt she is enjoying her 2002
   Volvo. Drive in in health little one, but watch the bumps.
   
       *****   UPDATE !!!  ************

   We have now owned this car for nearly a year . And I 
    stand my my above my somewhat gushy review .
   My daughter finally got her full license and now is 
    driving the car .  I had no idea we would have to wait until she was 16 and a half .

  She loves her Volvo .  And so do her friends .  We may have started a trend .  Three of them have requested Volvos
  for their first car.  
   Although this 850 was basically the plain jane base model , I have upgraded the sound system with a Alpine FM-CD unit with Infinity speakers , except for the rear where the speaker well was too shallow .  We substituted DMX's there.
 I also installed XM radio unit which adds 150 radio stations with digital sound.  Also installed was a "Cobra"
 anti-theft sytem .
  
 All may future cars will probally be Volvos .  They are interesting cars . And I love driving them.  Maybe someday I will get one for me.

 If you live near Dallas , I recommend my mechanic , whose
  name and phone and address I published above.
