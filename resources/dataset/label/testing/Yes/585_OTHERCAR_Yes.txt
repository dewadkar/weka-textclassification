            I'll admit it, I did an impulse buy and ended up with a Suzuki Swift.  I was going to buy a Mitsubishi Galant and when I got to the dealer, the financing for the Swift was so good, I jumped on it:  0% financing for 60 months.  The offer ended the next day, so I bought it without researching it as I had the Galant.  I drive about 100 miles a day, so I was really interested in a commuter car.  It's perfect for that.

I've had it for 8 months, 15,000 miles and I love it!  You can't beat the price for a new car.  I paid $11,500 for it.  Granted, I wish that it had a/c, but I'm going to install an aftermarket a/c and cruise control.  Total cost should be about $600 for both.  I also put in a nice CD changer and speakers $500.

I have the automatic transmission and am a little disappointed with the gas mileage.  I'm getting about 33 mpg.  Yes, that's good, but I was under the impression I'd get more.  I have an '86 MR2 and get the same with that.  The factory does say that it will get about 33 mpg on the highway and it's right on the nose.

Here's what I love:

The hatchback is great.  I keep the back seat down most of the time so I have easy access to my trunk.  It's big enough to haul stuff from Home Depot and groceries.  In fact, I have a fireplace in it now that I just picked up at the Goodwill.  They didn't think I'd get it in there, but I did.  I installed a cd changer and speakers and keep that covered up with a small box so it's not in view.  The small trunk has plenty of room for groceries and misc and is hidden with a cover.  However, it does rattle and bugs me, so I leave it off.

Good basic design:  For a car with so few options, I appreciate what they did include:  front dual air bags, the rear window defogger, 2 speed intermittent wipers, side storage in the doors, 2 cup holders.

Handles well in snow:  I live in Minnesota and drive from the country to the city late at night.  I needed dependability (which Suzuki offers) and a car that was good in the snow.  This thing handles like a champ.

Parking:  It is a joy to park this baby.  There's always room for me and my Suzuki.  Plus, since I didn't pay much for it, if someone dings it I don't lose any sleep over it.  

No Speeding Tickets:  One things for sure, you're not going to get speeding tickets.  I can cruise comfortably at 70 mph, but any higher than that and the motor starts talking back, so to speak.

Heater Kicks It Out:  Winters in Minnesota can be so frigid and this car started every night and heated up quickly and thoroughly.

Overall, this car is a great commuter car, but not much more than that.
