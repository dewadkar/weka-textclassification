            As a law student I need a car that would be reliable enough to use for a daily commute and practical enough not to tap my depleted wallet.  As I am young and young at heart I want a sporty car that could get me where I am going in style.  Finally, as a sports car fan I want car that packs some punch.

My solution was the 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT.

I purchased the car in June 2000.  I got it with the Sterling Silver Metallic paint which makes this car stand out in a crowd.  I also opted for the premium package which gave me leather, 4 disc in-dash CD changer, sunroof and a "Sportronic" automatic transmission.  After 6+ months of driving this car every day through every type of road condition imagineable I have several comments.

PERFORMANCE
As the car is small, light and is equipped with a 205 horsepower V6 you would figure that this car could fly.  Well...yes and no.  The car is definitely quick and certainly gives you more than sufficient power for everyday driving.  However, if you are a performance nut and wish to take this car to the drag strip, you might be a little dissappointed.  Acceleration for 0-60 is around 7-8 sec.  This is great for merging onto busy highways and having fun pulling away from traffic lights.  However, this car is a "sports" car, not a "race" car.  One must understand this and accept this car for what it is.  It's not a Ferrari, but still can push you back into your seat when pulling away from a dead stop.

HANDLING
The handling, while sporty and quick, is not quite what I expected.  Road feel strikes a nice balance between sports car and sedan.  You feel bumps in the road and the car is tight into turns, but you still feel comfortable.  Therefore, the car is not cumbersome to drive every day.  The steering however is a little dissappointing.  I sometimes feel "disconnected" with the road.  When taking a tight turn at speed, I am not always confident that the car is going to hold it.  I would have preferred a tighter feeling from the steering.

PRACTICALITY
6+ months and no mechanical problems.  Three trips to the dealer: 2 visits for oil changes and one for recall work on the steering.  However, insurance costs are very high for this car.  Also, you have to use premium gas; you can't use regular.  As it is a sports car, there are no bumpers.  Thus, be careful if you parallel park this car.  I'm sure it's expensive to repair or replace any of the body panels.  

QUALITY
There is a lot of plastic on the inside of the Eclipse.  After 6 months, the car has developed some squeaks and rattles.  Nothing has fallen apart or broken yet, but I don't like hearing the interior make noise as I drive.  Otherwise, the car seems well built and very sturdy.

SAFETY
With the premium package I got dual front airbags and side-impact airbags.  Thankfully, I have not seen them in action yet but it's comforting to know they're there.  Also with the premium package came ABS and traction control.  These features work great on wet pavement and in snow.  There have been several occasions over the past couple of months where these two features have made my driving experience safer and happier.  Finally, the Sportronic transmission allows the driver to regulate the vehicle's speed without using the brakes.  This is something I use all the time in snow and ice.  Instead of hitting the brakes and relying on ABS to slow the car down, I just downshift the car and allow the engine to brake for me.  However, once again this is a light, small sports car.  In snow or bad weather this makes it easier for the tires to lose grip on the pavement.  Also, in an accident, this means that the Eclipse is less strong than other cars.  For example, if the Eclipse was to collide with an SUV, the SUV's bumper might dent, but the Eclipse might be totalled.  Things to keep in mind when considering the cost of repairs and overall safety of the car.

COMFORT and FUN
The 4 disc CD changer, leather and sunroof add to comfort and fun associated with this car.  Also, the Sportronic transmission makes you feel like you are driving a manual transmission, but gives you the comfort of an automatic.  Finally, while there is a back seat, it's there for show.  I know of nobody who can fit back there.  There is no legroom in the back, and headroom is just as lacking.  This car is essentially a two seater--good for singles or couples, bad for families and people who like to drive all of their friends around in one car.
