            I recently bought the 2001 Chevy Impala, standard sedan.  It is perfect in price for my husband and I who are 2 years into our marriage and finally able to afford a new car, and perfect for the family that we plan to have.  What I mean is its sporty and good-looking enough for a young couple, but with safety features and space to accomodate children that may come in the future.. not to mention the friends we have now. 
I simply love driving the Impala.  I sold my 1992 Nissan pickup (which I've been driving since highschool), for a down payment on the Impala.  What a change it was!!!  I loved my Nissan, she treated me good, but its time for a change.  So, after a week of shopping around for used cars, we finally decided on a 1999 Chevy Cavalier.  Just before we were to finalize the deal we decided to check out some new cars.. just to see... then I got behind the wheel of the Impala LS with EVERYTHING.  This car was incredible and we both LOVED driving it.  It handles turns impressively, accelerates in a heartbeat, and is comfy to ride in.  Not to mention all the ammenities of the LS.  Then the practical side of me took over and I asked myself if I really needed all these perks... for me it was not really.. and the ones I want I can always install later, the standard sedan has space to put in almost anything that is in the LS and you can probably find a better deal than factory installed if you shop around.  So, we decided on the standard sedan, which you can hardly call stripped down. Its got a good sound system, I kinda wish it had a tape player, but we're going to replace it with a CD player later down the road, so no biggie.  The interior looks nice.. I love the wood trim.. it gives it a really classy look and is unique.  So far, I'm quite pleased with my Impala.. the LS is incredible, but mechanically the standard drives and feels just as good to me.
So, I now have my new 2001 Impala and love it!!  The only little things I didn't like were corrected in the LS or (in my case) will be corrected by me in time as I make it into exactly what I want with little add-ons.
This is an awesome car to drive!! (and I used to be the type that just looked at economical and safe... now I have that plus fun to drive)
