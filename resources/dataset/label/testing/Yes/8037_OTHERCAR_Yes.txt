            I drove the DOG out of this car.  My 1992 Saturn has 160,000 HARD miles on it and it has been marvelous.  It has consistently gotten good mileage and been the most reliable auto I've ever owned.  It has put up with abuse and kept on ticking.

My model is a souped up SL2 with leather upholstery and a sunroof.  It's a 5 speed and is just SO much fun.  It looks great.  My husband was driving and took a hit to the right front quarterpanel.  The engine mounting, water pump and radiator were torn up, but the only body damage was a one inch long crack in the wheel well.  The mechanic could not believe the car took a hit like that with so little damage.  The car that hit him was not driveable.

The major downside to Saturn--they are mighty proud of their parts and components.  We like to do our own work if it is a simple repair and time and time again at the parts store we were told that it was a &quot;dealership&quot; part only.  They are expensive parts often.  I will say that the people at the dealership are the NICEST of any car dealership I've ever been in.  I think if you told them to jump that they would ask &quot;how high?&quot;  A class operation all the way.  

This car is just the coolest. I've not felt brand loyalty since my last VW Beetle years ago.  I can't wait until I get a NEW Saturn.  I'm keeping the old one though--good transportation for my teenagers!<br><br>
