            I've rented well over a dozen Contour/Mondeos for a total driving time of over 2 years, so I've been able to compare across cars and across model years.  The Ford Countour/ Mondeo (I drive a European Contour, which is called a Mondeo) slides through life doing the minimum necessary, but it does so nicely. I've only had one problem with the Contour/Mondeo when the gearbox (I've almost always rented the stick-shift Contour/Mondeo 1.6 litre diesel) failed on the highway.  No problem - I managed to limp home and get a new car.  And this was a rental car, which people take pleasure in destroying, so that's better than par for the course.

For a diesel, the Contour/Mondeo is plenty fast.  That's probably partially because it is so light.  It's lightness, though, may be the reason why I feel a bit insecure in the car during wet weather.  More than once I've fishtailed in the rain when, if I were in, say, a small BMW, I would have been fine.  Of course, you can buy a 6-month-old Contour/Mondeo in continental Europe for under $15,000, which is important to remember when you read me criticising the Contour/Mondeo.  It's an inexpensive car and you get a well thought-out, decent machine for that money.  It's definitely worth the price.

ABS:  Works great, I feel very safe in snow and rain when it comes time to brake.  However, this does tend to make one drive faster than he or she should.

Seats:  Very good in front, with an excellent lumbar support.

Airbags:  Never had to try them, fortunately, but they look fineï¿½

Audio:  Could be better.  The Dodge Stratus, for example, has a really pumping stereo system.

Tires:  Low-quality, wear out very quickly.  Replace early and consider getting wider rims to stabilise the car in the rain and snow.

Noise:  The engine is extremely quiet.  However, road noise does become a factor at high speeds.  In Europe, we often cruise at well over 100 MPH while Americans drive much slower.  At the slower American speeds, you'll be fine noise-wise.

Trunk:  Simple, well-organised and reasonably large.  Not Saab-large, mind you, and the hatchback window does get in the way a bit, but remember - this car is inexpensive.

Anti-whiplash headrests:  Good, very adjustable.

Headlights and fog lights:  Excellent.

Instruments and instrument lighting:  Excellent.

Storage:  Plenty of storage opportunities inside, though the glove compartment could be a tad larger.

Windshield and wipers:  Excellent system to clear front and rear windscreens via embedded thermal wires, but the wipers should be better.

Warning:  The timing belts on Contour/Mondeos break.  Get yours replaced with a high-quality one early on and always keep a spare in the trunk.  Replace early and often.<br><br>
