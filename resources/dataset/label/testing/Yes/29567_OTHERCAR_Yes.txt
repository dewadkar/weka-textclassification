            I am not a camera expert and do not claim to be.  I have never owned a &quot;good&quot; camera in my life.  But I decided that I just had to have a digital camera so that I could easily email photos to family members in other states.
I ran across my Vivitar 2700 at egghead.com (when it was still onsale.com)
The price was so cheap that I couldn't resist.  $136.00, it was worth a chance.  In fact, for Christmas last year I purchased one for each of my married sons so that I could be sent pictures of my grandchildren, often.  Well, that didn't work very well, I still seldom see a picture attached to an email, but that's another story.
I found out immediately that we were going to have a battery problem.  I couldn't shoot and download a dozen pictures without replacing the batteries.  It was suggested to me that I try the Kodak Photolife batteries, and that did the trick.  They last through 50 picture shots and downloads.  The batteries run about $1.99 for two (you need four) at any discount store.
Using the camera is not difficult and within a few minutes I was taking pictures of everything.  Since this camera does not adjust the exposer automatically, you really have to watch it.  Make sure that the picture is a bit dark in the LCD read out or your picture will turn out too light.
It definitely doesn't have all the fancy extras that some of the more expensive cameras have, but then, I wouldn't know what to do with them if it had them.
Downloading to your PC is also very easy.  Within a few minutes, there were all my pictures and I could pick and choose which to save and which to delete.
If you are a novice with camera's like I am, and you can get this camera at a reasonable price, I would suggest it for a first time digital camera owner.
