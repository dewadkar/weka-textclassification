            As soon as I found out digital cameras were reaching affordable prices I wanted one.  I borrowed a Kodak DC50 from a friend and quickly learned that I wanted more features.  

After months of research and patient waiting for the cameras I was most interested in to come down in price I came across the DC280.  Mercata was offering 20% off any purchase for up to a $100 discount and it brought the DC280 down to a price I could afford.  I checked out all the reviews out there and found a site that compared the pictures from some Kodak models as well as a few of the Nikon cameras I was eyeing.  I liked the color output in the Kodak so I bought it.

I have had it for 6 months now and never regretted it.  I mainly use it to take pictures of my kids and their activities.  The results have been very good, always in focus and excellent color.  I have also found that the pictures print very well on my old epson inkjet on photo paper.  It has all of the features that I want and a few I may never use but are nice to have.  It is easy to use as a simple point and shoot camera too which I like.

I have read complaints about the battery life and I do agree to a point but I find as long as I use the screen in the back to review pictures and not as a viewfinder the batteries last me a very long time.

My complaints are the 8MB card I got with it and the delayed shutter.  Apparently it originally came with 32MB card and that would have been far better.  I find myself missing out on photo opportunities because I don't want to waste pictures.  I have also found that I have missed a few because of the shutter delay.  My last gripe would be the software.  It is excellent software but I would love something that would also download the photo information(date, resolution, quality etc)  with it so I don't have to find another way to keep such information.
