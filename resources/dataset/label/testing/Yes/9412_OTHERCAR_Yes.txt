            Ok, this review mainly covers my recent experience so far with the Coolpix 4500. For a complete list of the camera's features read the prior reviews or go to www.NikonUSA.com

Having had my Coolpix 995 stolen recently in Spain, my insurance company replaced it with the Coolpix 4500. 
There are some significant differences between the two cameras. The Coolpix 4500 is about 2/3 the size of the CP995 which is good. To do so, Nikon has omitted the status screen found on top of the CP995. Also the flat directional control button of the CP995 has been replaced by a raised toggle/joystick like button.  While the CP995 was rather easy and straight forward to use, I found that the CP4500 required a bit of relearning. The camera now comes equipped with a 16 scenario or shooting setting. Along with these settings comes an array of useful new features such as panoramic photograph assistance, in which the camera once told what direction to sequence the frames will tell you where to shoot to overlap the images for later "stitching" together in the accompanying Nikon View 5 software. The CP4500 like the CP995 is capable of recording a short video, but with the addition of sound.  Also included are the regular Automatic,Aperature Priority, Shutter Priority, Full Manual and Programmed Automatic modes.   
The Program Automatic mode,I found to be the most useful to maintain and use. In this mode you can set the autofocus to single focus (focuses when you depress the shutter button half way) versus continous autofocus where the camera constantly "hunts" to focus hence consuming precious battery time. The automatic,automatic mode works with default settings and is not customizable.
On the CP995 folders to organize your pictures on the memory card were created in the camera. The current CP4500 lost this feature or ability to name folders and instead creates them automatically only for the panorama and ultra highspeed modes for each instance either one of these two features are used.
Another observation that I have made is that images on the compact flash card must now be flagged or selected on the CP4500 camera before it is transfered to the computer in Nikon View 5. Whereas in the prior Nikon View 4,each of the images were shown as thumbnails and could be selected or flagged prior to being transfered.
The CP4500 accepts all of the Nikon Accessory lenses my favorite being the WC-E63 Wide Angle Converter.  I had this lense on my CP995 and have found this lense invaluable especially for shooting architecture or simply turning it on yourself for creative environmental portraits while traveling or out and about.
The built in speedlight flash took a while to get used to it flipping up as it now deploys automatically unless the "No flash" option is selected.
The macro capabilities of the CP4500 is of the same high quality as it's predecessor CP995.
All in all the Nikon Coolpix is a superb, solid and capable camera that should be a great replacement for the CP995. 

Review Update December 9
I actually used the preset scene modes to shoot some of the beautifully lit Christmas cruise boats during the nightly parades around the lake and Elliott Bay here in Seattle. I used the "dawn/dusk" mode to capture the colored lights as they reflected off of the water. I hand-held the camera and the results were amazing.  The true test of a successful night shot is seen in the light source if it is round and not streaky or wavy as when the image is captured with a slow shutter speed and motion is introduced either by object movement and/or camera shake. I was also able to get great results during a trip to Leavenworth, a Bavarian themed town in northeastern Washington state during their annual Christmas tree and streetscape city lighting ceremonies. The Nikon 4500's capabilities and features continue to astound me. Get out and try all of these modes.
