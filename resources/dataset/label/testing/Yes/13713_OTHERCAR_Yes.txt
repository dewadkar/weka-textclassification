            Gorgeous exterior and interior with every bell &amp; whistle imaginable led me
to buy a used 1998 Eldorado Base Coupe recently. The Bose sound system is
incredible. The ride comfort is exceptional with a very plush interior.
The base model features a 275 HP Northstar engine which goes from 0-60 in
about 7 seconds or less. It's a luxury rocket! It has better low speed acceleration, a softer ride, smoother steering, better gas mileage,and has a more attractive chrome trim and front grill than the more costly ETC.
Nearly all the ETC features the base coupe does not come with can be 
purchased as options in the base coupe while still saving money. A feature
I highly recommend is the integrated phone with Onstar system. This phone system is voice activated and can be operated without taking your eyes off the road. Speak a name or phone number to the phone microphone above your head followed by &quot;call&quot; and the number is automatically dialed for you. Why
get a convertible when you can have a large sun roof installed for $ 1,000.  A very worth while option. Heated seats are a must up North.
Front wheel drive is not popular these days with rear wheel drive traction assist. However, front wheel drive Eldorados are great in slippery/ icy
conditions and can easily power their way through snow drifts. My old Lincoln Town Car had traction assist but I had to load 200 lbs. of salt bags in the trunk each winter to get traction. With front wheel drive, all the engine weight is above the wheels giving great traction and less need for traction assist. The car has a smooth ride and corners well without excessive lean. Gas mileage is very good for a car/engine of this size.
The stabilitrac option, in my opinion, is not necessary and just an added expense. A simulated, convertible, cloth (not vinyl) top makes a sharp car even more attractive and can be added by your local dealer for around $1,000. Another accessory I have is a chrome luggage rack on the trunk and
chrome rocker panel accents. These combined with the optional chrome wheels make the car really sparkle!
 
With all the toots &amp; whistles, things need to be fixed frequently. My biggest problem with the car is excessive wind/road noise through the driver's door at highway speeds. It is a very quiet car under 60 mph, but
quite noisy above 60 mph. I've had electronic problems with the phone and
stereo systems which are currently being fixed. The big doors do not have enough weather stripping to shut out road/wind noise. It's the perfect car
for a person who wants performance but not at the expense of total luxury. <br><br>
