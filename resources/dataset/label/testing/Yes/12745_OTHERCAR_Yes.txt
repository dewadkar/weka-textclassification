            I purchased this camera a few months ago for over $600.  A key factor in my decision was the &quot;free&quot; smart card reader that would enable me to quickly transfer images and the small size of the camera.

Without the smart card reader, you will have to transfer images through the provided serial cable, which is very annoying because of its very slow speed.  

Each time I contacted Fuji, I was told the smart card reader would be delivered in a couple of weeks.  This went on for six months!  So while the digital camera market was changing and the camera was losing value, my camera just sat in the box.

I love the small size.  I'd rather give up some quality in order to have a camera that I can easily take and put in my coat pocket(or in my wife's purse &lt;grin&gt;).

With a smart card reader, getting images into my computer is easy.  However, now that I've used the smart card reader for a few weeks I recommend to my friends that they get a camera with a USB port.  I find that I sometimes go to use the camera and discover that I forgot to put the smart card back in the camera.  With a USB port, the card doesn't have to be removed.

Also, I'd recommend an optical (not digital) zoom.  At the time I bought this camera, Fuji didn't have a small camera with optical zoom.

In addition, I suggest that people considering a camera look at the cycle time (the time between taking one picture and the camera being ready to take another).  

I find that I take a lot of pictures with a digital camera to increase the chanced that I will get a good shot.  I'm not that good a photographer, but I figure if I take a lot of pictures my odds will improve!  Therefore, I would prefer a camera with a faster cycle time in order to take 2 or 3 pictures in a row.

The picture quality is very good....almost (but not quite) as good as an average film camera. <br><br>
