            I had an oppurtunity to buy a 1988 Mazda RX-7 GX (non-turbo) last summer. I bought the car as a learning experience because I really enjoy trick japanese sports cars. 

The car I had was a white with blue interior 5-speed. No air-conditioning, and basic stereo, and sunroof. The car was well maintained, and had low mileage for it's age. I refreshed the car with Bridgestone Potenza tires, and a new exhaust system. 

If you are used to driving the usual sedan like me, the first thing you notice is the very low seating. The view is suprizingly good for how low you sit. When driving the car, the steering provides a very quick responce. The ratio of the steering is very quick, but light. The gearbox is smooth, reliable, and easy. The gear ratios are nearly perfect for the usual driving. The engine is not loud, and the ride is firm but not too aggressive. The brakes feel very strong, and an added feature is the cooling ducts integrated into the front for brake cooling.

The controls are easy, and quality. The gauges are excellent with the big tach right in the middle. The orange gauges are very cool. I opted to swap in a custom steering wheel, the design of the car makes it fairly easy to do, although I had a little bit of trouble with the quality of the turn-signal cancel mechanism. This was easily fixed, and wouldn't have happened if I had not changed the wheel.

There are a ton of aftermarket performance parts available for this car, but wheels can be a little bit of a hassle because of the slightly odd wheel bolt pattern. This isn't too bad unless you are very picky as to what your aftermarket wheels look like.

Overall, an excellent value these days, and was easy to sell when I was done driving it. In my opinion, these cars should only be driven by enthusiasts who know how to maintain them. They do require more maintainance than usual. This is because they are beginning to show their age a bit. Any car this old will.

If you are mechanically inclined, then buy one, but for an average person with little or no access to a garage or tools, I would pass.
