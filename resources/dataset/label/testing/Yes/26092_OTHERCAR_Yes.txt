            As a beginning driver, my parents bought me a 1999 Mazda Protege LX. The price was $15,500.  It came with a CD player, AC, power everything, airbags, etc. Basically everything that the highest version, the ES, has except the moon roof and a faster engine.  
     I have found this car to be everything i wanted. I have had absolutely no trouble with it. I have driven it on the interstate, in stop and go traffic, and even off-road.(which it performed wonderfully on) 
     My friends all love my car, and three other people drive 1999 protege's and love them also. it is roomy inside, with a VERY spacious trunk. The stereo system which it came with it is exceptional also, and many people do not believe that it was factory issued.  
     One great thing about this car is that it gets great gas mileage. Also, it costs around $13 to fill the tank all the way up.
     My parents bought this car for me because of the price and the comfort of me driving a new car. 
     The only bad thing i have to to say about the protege is that mine is not very fast and does not have very good pick-up. which is another reason why my parents bought it-they did not think that i needed a fast car. 
     Driving this vehicle is so easy, and my friend who drives a Dodge Neon always asks to drive my car because it is so much easier. Also, her parents are now wishing that they had bought her a Protege because of all the problems they have with her Neon. 
     I would say that a person that is looking for an affordable, dependable, roomy car should look into a protege.  Someone looking for a faster, more sporty car should look elsewhere.
