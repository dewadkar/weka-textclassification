            I own a 1991 Toyota 4Runner, SR5 V6 with the manual transmission with over 200,000miles and it is just as incredible as it was new. Everything still works on this truck ! 

Specs :
V6 3.0l with 150hp.
5 Speed manual transmission.
17.2 Gallon fuel tank.
31x10,5R 15LT Tires.

Review :
People are amazed at how quiet the ride is. Handling is a bit soft and more noticeable on turns but this makes for a comfortable "car-like" ride. It is roomy, comfortable and looks good. Visibility is excellent. 

Mechanical :
The clutch is finally due and my front brakes are getting soft. That's it. Doesn't burn a drop of oil, 4WD works to perfection. 4WD is on-the-fly and requires no extra maneuvers. 

Negative:
One of the only down sides is that this truck is thirsty when it comes to gas.
