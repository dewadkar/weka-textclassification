            My family got this car about three weeks ago.  We bought an Oldsmobile because they have always been known as a well made car, and after 100 years of making quality cars, it is sad to see that they have little to no market anymore and will be shutting down.

I guess I can start by stating the obvious.  The car has 4 doors, which is good for a family of 4 or 5, if you have small children, and is a five seater.  In this case, the car is maroon.  It is a good sized car, not too compact, and not a long boat.  It has a large sized trunk space, which is really great for road trips.  The interior of the car is roomy, however, there is only one cupholder attached to a console in the middle of the front seats. The front seats are powered to move up or down.

Surprisingly, this car had a lot of features, compared to my '97 Cavalier.  It has power windows and locks.  What I like about the drivers window is that all you have to do is press the roll down button once and it rolls down the rest of the way automatically.  When we test drove the car, one of the back windows wasn't working, but we got it working before the end of the drive.  The back windows are child safe, only rolling halfway down.  This car also has cruise control, which I have not tested out yet, since I have not had a chance to take this car on a trip yet.

The seatbelts are attached to the door, which is a feature that I don't like.  I often get stuck in the seatbelt.  Also, the doors lock immediately as soon as the car is put into reverse, but once the ignition is turned off, the doors do not unlock, and I always make the mistake of trying to open the doors when they are locked.  I don't like getting trapped in the car.

The heating system seems to be a bit slow, and since we are having a really cold winter here in Sudbury, I have not tried out the air conditioning yet.  I have a remote starter, but you have to be in the car to turn the heating on properly by the press of a button, so sometimes the remote starter isn't completely helpful.  When I try to start up the car in the morning, or after a 6 hour shift at work, the car doesn't want to start with the remote starter, and I have to start it manually because it chugs.  However, this is probably my fault though, because I have never plugged it in.

As for driving the car, it is a relatively smooth ride.  But after a week of driving the car, it stalled while I was stopped at a traffic light.  It seemed to be fine after that for another week, then it stalled again.  My dad is looking at changing the air filter as I am typing this.  Hopefully, that will solve the problem.

A funny thing that happened to me as soon as I got the car, was that I only had one set of keys so I went immediately to get another set made (one for the ignition and one for the doors and trunk).  The guy who was making the keys said that he was really surprised that the keys worked because they were so worn down and really thin.  He made another set but they didn't work.  He said that we would have to get the locks replaced, but luckily, he was able to grind the keys down a bit, and then they worked.  So if you are ever considering buying a car like this, the moral of the story is to always have an extra set of keys that work.
