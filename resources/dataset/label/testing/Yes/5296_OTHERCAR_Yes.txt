            We just purchased a used 98 Accord LX w/ the v6.  This car is overly loaded w/ options including leather seats, cd player and sun roof.  It just seems strange that so much would go into a car to make it the more elegant and advanced of its class that it would have a cheesey tilt lever on the steering wheel.  I have been impressed w/ the ride quality and the lack of cabin noise but the nicest thing is the automatic a/c, i had that in an older thunderbird but this one actually seems to work.  Best of all is the roominess in the back seat, it almost seems to have more leg room in the rear than in the front.<br><br>
