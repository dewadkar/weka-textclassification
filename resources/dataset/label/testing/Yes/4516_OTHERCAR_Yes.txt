             For ten years I had driven a Toyota corolla and was very happy with it. I decided it was time for a new car.  My budget insisted that it be an economy car and I decided that instead of buying a bottom-of-the-line corolla, I would buy a top-of-the-line tercel.  I purchased it in January of 1992 and we've been together ever since.  I chose the 2-door DX, 5 speed. In eight years the only things that I have had to replace/repair were the oil, filters, battery and tires. I'm still on the original clutch and brakes after 63,000 miles of (for the first 2 years) hard driving. The first year I put 32,000 miles on it.  The trunk space is non-existent, the ride isn't too smooth (what car under $14,000 gives you that) and it now has a few squeaks, but over-all I'm very pleased with it's performance.  I have never had a tune-up (I don't recommend this), but still I'm getting over 30 mpg.  I pass other so-called luxury cars going up steep grades, and my tercel is as peppy as ever.  If you want a basic transportation car that is reliable, I definitely recommend this car. <br><br>
