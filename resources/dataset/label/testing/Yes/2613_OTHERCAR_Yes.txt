            My 1999 Maxima SLE is superbly engineered. Everything you could think of has been preconceived. Lights go on when they should. Everything fits. The car rides quietly and is excellent for cornering.It gets remarkable fuel mileage, and is excellent on the road. The stereo has great sound.Its main liability is its styling which is really &quot;blah.&quot; I cannot even identify other Maximas on the road without looking at the title even though I own one. Yet, this too can be viewed affirmatively since you love the car for its great engineering and not for its flash and sparkle of looks.The trunk space is excellent, also. I am tall, and I never worry about hitting the roof, either. Just a great car, blah in its appearance but otherwise excellent
