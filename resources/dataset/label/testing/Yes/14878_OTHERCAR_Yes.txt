            I don't actually own this camera,but my parents do and I've used it numerous times,enough to form my own opinion.
My parents purchased this camera after my son,their first grandchild,was born.They got it at an online auction about a year ago or more,the price was never openly discussed,but it was around $500 dollars,a pretty penny to pay,of course.
My father enjoys photography and wanted to try digital,not only because of the new option,but because the film would be on disk,making it easier for family in different states to keep up with my son's growth.
This camera is very easy to use,you can make short one minute movies,do black and white or in color shots,and view your shots right away,deleting the one you don't care for.I think it's an attractive camera,though the battery charge doesn't  last for very long.Fully charged,it will last around 120 minutes,I believe.
There are many pros to owning a digital camera,cost of film can get high if you really enjoy taking shots,while you can get a large pack of disks and take around 25 shots,you would have to pay double or triple for actual film,not to mention the costs of developing.If there's a shot you really enjoy and want printed out,you can choose the size,altar the colors,and all you need is a printer and some Kodak paper.We've taken many shots of my son and had them enlarged on the computer up to an 8x10,and then added border and little poems at the bottom.These things will be a keepsake for my son someday and our family as well.
The only down side I've found to this camera so far has been that there seems to be more frequent red-eye with the shots I've taken,although that's really no big deal because you can reduce it on your computer,which is very convenient.
The camera seems to be very durable,we've all managed to keep scratches off of it,even through all of it's trips to family reunions,weddings,birthday parties,and even my sister's dorm room.
It also has a comfortable strap so that you can carry it around your neck when your hands are full,and it charges up very quickly.Our entire family has gotten lots of use from this camera and my son's long distance grandmother can keep up with what he's doing as he changes daily.I think it's a good investment to make and you'll  get your money's worth.<br><br>
