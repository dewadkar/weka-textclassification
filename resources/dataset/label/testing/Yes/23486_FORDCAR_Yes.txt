            This is a big, fun, stylish car to drive, and it comes at a great price.  It has excellent handling, great pickup, and comfortable seats for all.  The five-star safety quality makes anyone feel safe in this car.  Plus, it has a suave round design, making it appropriate and stylish for anyone to drive.  

We bought this vehicle for the safety and size, and this car has never let us down in the last year. It runs smoothly, has great power steering, and is has enough power to satisfy those sudden urges to accelerate ludicrously.

Overall, the 2000 Ford Taurus is a great car, is fun to drive, safe, stylish, and powerful.  I would reccommend it to anyone at all, from the common bum to the well-off family person.  <br><br>
