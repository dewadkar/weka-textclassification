            I originally drove a full size Ford Bronco, and while I had it, I was looking to buy a second vehicle that had to be a convertible.  I looked at the Cavalier but didn't like the body style.  I also looked at a few of the imports, but didn't really like how they looked or their price.  Then I looked at the Sebring and instantly loved how it looked and felt it was the right price for what it had to offer.
   Every weekend there is a radio show hosting a Mechanic who gives answers to callers about odd things their cars or doing or just general advice.  One day someone called and asked about how he felt about the Sebring.  He said he loved the car, he bought several himself, and that it looks much better in the darker colors (which I agree with).  So that was when I finally made up my mind (and after a couple test drives of course).  I then lost my Bronco in an accident (I still miss having a truck), so I then bought the Sebring JXi.  I constantly got waves and honks and people smiling and looking at the car.  Then 4 months after I bought it, I was rear ended, BAD.  Needless to say, from that experiance, the Sebring can withstand a rear and collision VERY well.  I was hit by a drunk driver who was driving a van.  I was at a dead stop, and he was doing approximatly 35-40 mph.  Me nor my passenger were injured.  The vehicle was totalled, and I bought another Sebring.  4 months was NOT enough to fulfill my desire of this convertible.  I'm now driving a 2000 Sebring Convertible JXi and still love it.
   Things I like about this car:
Styling
Colors
Roomy
Comfortable seats
6 speaker AM/FM/Cassette/CD with infinity system.  (sounds great with OR without the top down)
Get a lot of attention :)
Hood and Trunk aren't metal (great when we had golfball sized hail!)
Handles turns surprisingly well for a convertible
Great options including 4 wheel antilock disk brakes and trip computer
&quot;Sentry Key&quot; (Key with a chip in it, without it the engine will run for a few seconds and die)
&quot;HomeLink&quot; system in sun visor for garage door openers
All Season Group is a must have for those of you in states with snow
Fantastic gas mileage
   Things I don't like about this car:
The high beams aren't very bright
The engine is a little weak (coming out with a bigger one for the 2001 along with new styling)
The transmission lags a little too much when downshifting
No options for a fully manual transmission (autostick doesn't count)
Odd sized radio, makes it a little tougher to install aftermarket radio systems
