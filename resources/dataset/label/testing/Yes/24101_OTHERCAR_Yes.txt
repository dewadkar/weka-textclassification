            At first glance, the new Le Sabre is recognizably a Buick, and easily mistaken for a Park Avenue. It is only slightly smaller than the Park, and has a very similar silhouette with a long, arched passenger cabin and high rear fenders. But the Le Sabre is less formal, with an oval chromed waterfall grille similar to that of the Century, and more rounded contours than those of the Park Avenue. The roof treatment is unusual when viewed from the front, high at the rain channels near the edges and then curved normally towards the center. Discreet chrome trim around the side windows, headlights, and full-width taillight applique provides definition. The Limited has a shoulder pinstripe and multi-spoke alloy wheels. 

The Le Sabre is Buick's core model, and has been the best-selling full-sized sedan in the country for the past seven years. There can be considerable pressure for conservatism with that sort of success. Fortunately, Buick has resisted that pressure. Although it is a traditionally full-sized American five or six-passenger sedan like its predecessor, the 2000 Buick Le Sabre is an all-new car, and is much closer to the premium Park Avenue. 

     The 2000 Buick Le Sabre is built from the same platform &quot;architecture&quot; as the Buick Park Avenue and Riviera. It is stronger and more rigid than the old Le Sabre platform for a more solid feeling, quieter ride, and improved handling. A longer wheelbase adds stability on the road and room inside. 

     Two models of the new Le Sabre are offered, both powered by the familiar 3800 Series II V6 engine. The Custom is very well- equipped. The Limited adds comfort and convenience features including dual-zone automatic climate control with air filtration, a driver information center, power seats, a high-grade audio system, alloy wheels, and remote keyless entry. Plenty of options are available to bring a Le Sabre up to near-luxury levels, but at a very reasonable price, as I discovered with this week's test car. 

     In my driveway is a fully-equipped 2000 Le Sabre Limited. It's as smooth, quiet, roomy, and comfortable as expected. Thanks to the Gran Touring suspension and the venerable 3800 engine, it handles surprisingly well and moves quickly, with little thirst for gas. Buick is trying to attract younger buyers, and this Le Sabre should help. It has as much interior space as many medium-sized SUVs, and is far more comfortable.
