            This is one sweet bit of styling and the car carries it irrelevant of the color.  Mispronunciations of "Ce-lee-ca" are common, its not "Cell-i-kah" like most Americans tend to say, lets get it right!  The Celica is considered to be a personal luxury car.

It does have a back seat indeed, but only for the tiny or hitchikers desperate for a ride.  Consider it a two passenger and get some extra trunk space.  The 1.8L and 16 valve DOHC engine that intakes about 140 hp for approximately 6000 is pretty much a muscle car.   Going with 4 speed automatic will definitely kill your horse power;  it is still sufficient keep in mind.

The Celica's made for longer legged drivers.  The backseats are very crowded and potentially cause cramps and aches in the lower limbs.  I am so serious, a majority of friends driving in this car refuse to step back in unless they will be in the passenger seat! 

Yet when you get behind the wheel, you will find that the steering is very smooth and precise.  Changing lanes can be fun with this car;  it'll be a simple twitch of your forefinger and you are in the next lane.

The standard items you can find are the power locks, tach, aluminum wheels, spoiler (place that baby high for a great look), power mirrors, intermittent wipers and automatic headlamps.

Other features to the car will include the ABS, cruise control and keyless entry.  Adding these features costs you about $800.  Its your choice.

The car isn't for everyone, let's be honest here.  It's an oversized two seater car and not a family car.  Forget about loading miscellaneous large items, it just will not work.  The car combines sporty looks and feel to make it an independent drive of a car and the occasional grocery bag within the passenger sear.   Make sure you look nice .... this is a car people will eyeball!

Overall the car is decent, has great mileage for a tank of gas and is worth the purchase for someone who is single or dating but not the family type of car.  Stick to the Caravan market Mom's and Dad's!
