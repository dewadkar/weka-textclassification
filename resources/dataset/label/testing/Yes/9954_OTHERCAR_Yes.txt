            This Saab was my first...and when I first thought about looking for one, I was initially attracted to the 9-5 Wagon as a replacement for my Volvo 850 Turbo wagon.  

I was invited to a Saab Test Drive event that was centered around the Viggen, and found myself initially drawn to the 9-5 wagon first, which was also on offer.  I followed up the test drive of the 9-5 with the Viggen.

It took all of 30 seconds for me to realize that this was the car I always wanted...all it took was the rush of the turbo, the instant pull of the engine, and the grip of the seats and the tight handling to make me head straight to the Saab dealer and put in an order for a Lightning Blue 5 door. 

The car arrived in December of '99 and since then I've put 9,000 miles on it. Every mile is a joy (except when the roads condition is poor...this car doesn't like potholes, and I've already suffered two bent 17" rims as a result)and I still find it amazing to feel such incredible power from a 4 cylinder engine that also gives over 30MPG on the highway!  I also find the torque steer to make the car much more entertaining, and I think the car mags gave the car a bad rap for no reason.  Having driven an M3 and an Audi S4, I can say I still get back in the Saab and find it a more interesting ride.  Plus, FWD w/ snow tires creates a competent winter car...something the M3 won't be.

The back seat is not as roomy as I thought I was when I first bought it (but it's rarely used), and over the past few months, there are a few rattles emerging (likely in the seat latch mechanism or the hatch itself), but I have confidence in the dealer to address them at the 10K service. And a touch up stick is critical for the front spoiler...it's almost impossible to NOT scratch the front spoiler, which is very low to the ground...

Overall, I'm thrilled with this car, plan on keeping it for at least 5 years, and love the fact that no one else has one.
