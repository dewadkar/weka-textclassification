            I purchased a Subaru Impreza (like the one pictured) in September 1998 and I love it.  The handling is tight and sharp, better than most cars I've driven.  I have yet to have any problems with this car, all I have done is change the oil for the past 30,000. 

I'm not a well versed &quot;car person&quot;, but a regular joe user who wants a car that fits my personality and lifestyle; I want it to be trouble free and keep me out of trouble when necessary.  This car is all of those things.  The All Wheel Drive (AWD) feature it the #1 supreme characteristic of this car.  When everyone else is slipping and sliding on rain, snow, or even ice, you feel securely anchored to the pavement in this vehicle.  

The few cons to this car are minor design flaws:  The cup holder is in front of the temperature controls and the rounded hatch back reduces storage capacity (I used to fit more in my tiny Subaru Justy because it was so square).  

One more note:  The brakes of this vehicle tend to squeak often.  My father has the same car it does the same thing.  We took it to the dealer and they said that it was the materials used in the particular brake pads for this car that made them get dusty and squeaky very easily.  As long as we wash our Impreza regularly, the brake dust is kept to a minimum, and the breaks don't squeal.<br><br>
