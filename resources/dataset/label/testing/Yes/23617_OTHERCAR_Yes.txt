            It's a JEEP thing!  What does that mean anyway...never quite got it, but I do have a Jeep and I LOVE it!  I have a 1996 Jeep Cherokee Classic.  We bought it in 1997 with only 50 miles on it, it now has over 61,000.  I will NEVER go back to a car and any future purchases will be a Jeep Cherokee of some kind.  Some day I hope to upgrade.  Now, with anything, the Jeep has it's good points &amp; bad...but more good.

It's definitely not a family vehicle, so you better have something else for any lengthy travels.  There's no leg room in the back, it's definitely made for children.  The front could stand a little more leg room, although the '96 model compared to the '97 model (Sport) does have more leg room in the front.  My husband is 6'2&quot; and we must have physically compared the two a zillion times before we bought.  Besides we compared the written specs too and the '96 had more, not much, but enough to matter to Mr. Long Legs!  I don't like the cup holder.  It doesn't hold large cups or bottles and it's not attached, it hooks into the console and is easily knocked down.  It's not necessarily the smoothest ride I've had, but it's not horrible either.  I didn't buy it for smooth ride anyway.

Otherwise, I really love it.  It's fun, it's sporty.  I've got room in the very back for lots of groceries or packages too.  I've not had an ounce of trouble with it either.  I keep the maintainence up on it and take good care of it.  They aren't cheap, but than most vehicles aren't these days.  It's even come in handy during the winter weather having 4-wheel drive. It's great and I highly recommend one...you'll never own anything else again once you buy a Jeep.<br><br>
