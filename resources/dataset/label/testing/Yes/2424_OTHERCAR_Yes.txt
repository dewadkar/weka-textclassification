     The first new vehicle I ever purchased was a 1995 Jeep Cherokee and yes I still own it.  For myself, at the time, it was perfect, I was 23, fresh out of college and not very liquid.  I wanted an SUV so I could drive on the beach and I wanted new because I had driven used clunkers my whole life.  Unfortunately though, I didn't have a ton of money.  Enter the Cherokee.

     I bought the absolute stripped down bare bones 4wd model (power nothing, not even a cassette factory radio) you name it, this truck didn't have it.  However it looked good on the outside, I only spent about $16,500 and most importantly for me it did great on the beach.  I have never gotten stuck in my Jeep and have actually helped tons of more expensive SUVS be dug out of the sand.  I still love to take this truck on the beaches of the Outer Banks with my dog and drive along the ocean.  The salt air ruins trucks there but it's no bother to me because I'll keep this truck until it dies.  It's got over 90,000 miles on it and still chugging.  

     If I could have gotten one &quot;frill&quot; though I most certainly would have gotten the 6 cylinder engine.  The 4 cylinder that I have offers no pickup whatsoever.  I've taken this Jeep skiing in the mountains of West Virginia and honestly wondered if I'd make it up some of those mountains.  Through the years it's also developed some interesting noises while you're riding in it.  It's certainly no Lexus with a clank clank here and a click click there.  But hey, for what it is, it does the job.  I think this would be a great vehicle to send a kid to college with or if you want to own a quality 4wd cheap.<br><br>
