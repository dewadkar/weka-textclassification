            I had read the prior opinions regarding the Sequoia. In particular I had to laugh at the opinion, which stated that 240HP, was inadequate for a truck of this size. In the same comment the writer goes on to say X has more hp but "35 lbs. less torque".  To any others out there unfamiliar with the two terms. It is torque that does the work. When youï¿½re talking about moving a heavy vehicle THE KEY COMPONENT is Torque not horsepower. Look at any agricultural equipment. Low horsepower high torque. This engine package is more than adequate to move this vehicle quickly both off the line and under towing loads. So here is my breakdown:

Engine: Indy tested, one of the best V8 engines on the market today. An animal with the latest and greatest technology including the best Ultra Low Emission results of any V8 marketed today. An absolute animal which with regular maintenance will last many years to come. 32 Valve design means better more efficient intake and exhaust cycles.

Body: Very clean lines, the only complaint I have heard which I understand is that it is "pretty". It can handle off road duty but you will probably not want to take it there in order to save the finish. Typical Toyota build quality, not a rattle or squeak to be heard.

Interior: Huge, extremely well laid out. All the items you would want with 10-cup holders, large storage areas, and lots of legroom. The eight passengers will fit and do so comfortably. Headroom throughout the cab. Heated seats are great, as is dual control climate control. 

Overall Ride, Outstanding control in all environments, great handling and a sense that you are driving a smaller vehicle than you are. Great sight lines, no blind spots, and great mirrors for wide-angle viewing

Overall impressions: The best ride in the class. Smooth powerful and ergonomic. A must drive if your looking for a large SUV. Ranks as one of the best vehicles I have ever driven, and I have driven a lot of vehicles in my time.
