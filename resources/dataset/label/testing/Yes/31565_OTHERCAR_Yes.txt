            The Volvo 240 is a great car for all the reasons you describe.  The only problem with them is that they are extremely uncomfortable for taller drivers (I am 6' 5&quot;).  I bought mine in 1991, and traded it with my sister after just a few months.  The center console juts into the area where your right leg would rest in such a way that any trip over 30 minutes was torture for me.  Also, the 240 seat is quite high and the roof is rounded, so that while I could sit without my head touching the roof, I was driving the car looking out the windshield through the tinted section along the top.  Trying to see traffic signals and street signs was a chore, because I literally had to lean over to the side.

I have spoken to several friends who are relatively tall who have had similar complaints.  But, we all universally agree that the car itself was great in terms of durability, reliability, looks, etc.<br>
