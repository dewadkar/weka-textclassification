            I was searching for my &quot;Big Boy Toy&quot; for this year and knew I needed a new digital camera. A friend of mine had previously gotten the DC-260 last year and was just ecstatic about it. He showed me some of the pics he had taken with it and I was duly impressed. The resolution was fantastic. He is a professional journalist and his pics get published all the time. I began doing massive research and the only camera I could come up with that really suited my needs and was within my price range was the DC-280. I chose the 280 over the 260 basically because it is an &quot;upgraded&quot; version of the 260, with a few more goodies. And the price was right. I got the standard package, with an extra memory card and thus far I am pleased as punch with the camera's capabilities. I am still in the learning process and the only drawback I have encountered is the macro or close up capability. It sometimes doesn't get quite the close up resolution I occasionally need, but I can compensate for that.   <br><br>
