            There are many fine digital choices for 'point and shoots' at this price range. The Fuji is the best buy as it has better features. The USB transfer 'cam to the computer' is much quicker than a serial port transfer system, not to mention eliminating the problems with setting up the serial ports. USB cable transfer is far better. The camera itself weighs less and is more attractive than its predecessor at this price level, the Fine Pix 1400 (owned by my brother).  The picture quality of the cams are the same, good to very good, however the 2300 is a little easier to operate and works a little faster. 

Learn the relative sizes of pics you will need. I suggest staying away from the 'fine' settings which takes huge pics, far too large for email or web work. Settings should be at 'normal' for picture quality, that way they are still large and clear and they will allow many more shots on the memory card. You will want to utilize or learn how to use 'image software' to clean-up your work that is part of the software bundle and there is always 'adobe' or 'paintshop pro' both excellent software 'darkrooms'. 

The eight meg memory card that comes with the unit should be replaced with a card at least double that size. Keep the original card as spare 'film'. Memory prices have fallen, so there are deals out there.

The battery life is reasonable, but always carry spares. Costly accessories abound but I use a generic nickel halide charger and batteries from Wal-mart for less than fifteen dollars. Wal-mart has a great little tripod for this (and other digital cams).The tripod allows you to set the timer and jump into the picture. Also get the power eliminator which powers the unit while you transfer pics, to save your bats. A generic unit runs around twenty bucks and can be ordered painlessly on line, or they run sixty dollars in a shop.

There are also small smart media readers and these are online all over for about thirty dollars on sale. 

The camera needs a case as the lens is left unprotected. Carry lens cleaners as you will spend a lot of time wiping the lens as well as well as the LCD screen on the back as they both attract finger prints.

The pictures are excellent. Not as good as a seventy- dollar '35 mm point and shoot', but the digitals get better each time they are reincarnated.  This unit is much better on the basics than the Olympus or Kodaks in the same price range. The Fuji does it better across the board.
