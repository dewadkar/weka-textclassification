            My first digital camera was a Sony Mavica.  Not the current model, by any stretch of the imagination.  We're talking years ago, when pictures were still being saved on regular floppies.  I was impressed then that I could have a nice image on my monitor or TV.

Now I can have a nice picture.  Printed.  Focused.  Zoomed.  Filtered.

The CoolPix 950 does everything you'd expect a camera from Nikon to do.  The 3X digital zoom can be enhanced by either a 2x or 3X lens.  Both Wide Angle and Fish Eye lenses are also available.  And, with the fish eye, you're supposed to be able to do the I-Pix thing. (360 degree photos specially processed by I-Pix.) 

Image quality runs from VGA (640x480) through the top mega pixel range.  You can take between 16 and 100 pictures with the 8 meg flash ram that comes with the camera depending upon the setting.  You can also get close up, focusing down into the centimeteres, or do wide angle for a broad view or group photos. 

Bringing photos into your computer or showing them on a TV is easy.  The built in LCD screen a crisp and clear.  It can be turned off to save batteries. (A nice addition, because this baby eats electrons faster than you can imagine.  Get a good set of rechargables.)  You can also focus and shoot through the eyepiece, which is a feature mean digitals don't have.  

Lens are fairly cheap, but also block the view finder.  (It's a small camera you could put in your coat pocket.)

Certainly one of the most attractive digitals out there.
