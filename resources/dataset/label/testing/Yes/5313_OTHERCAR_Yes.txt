            I was shopping around, and I had all these questions and criteria for my soon to be car.  The most important factor was the PRICE of the car.  I had a budget of $18000-20000.  After much hunting, I realized there were a host of cars that fall in that price range.  A bare-bones SUV, a Toyota Camry, a souped-up smaller car were just a few on my list.  I picked the Honda Accord LX (1998) for many reasons ... the main one being VALUE.  It would be impossible for me to explain all of the reasons that make this car one the best on the market ... but I'll try to give you a taste of what I see in my Accord.

First of all, it's roomy.  Yep, you don't have to squeeze in the back seat.  Definitely three (sometimes four) people can sit comfortably.  The front passenger seat offers a lot of leg room as well (a different world compared to my former car, a VW Golf).  All in all, the seats a very comfy, as has been proved on my longer car trips.  Speaking of trips, the gas mileage is outstanding.  In the great city of Philadelphia (where I live), it gets about 28 miles to the gallon.  On the highway, you can squeeze about 450 miles on a full tank of gas.  The pick-up is great.  I have a 4 cylinder VTEC engine -- it feels like a V6.  Of course it doesn't stick to the ground on sharp bends at higher speeds (like a sports car), but it doesn't really drift much either.  The control panel on the dash board is very user friendly.  Most of the buttons that you might want to fiddle with while you're driving are very accessible.  The trunk also is very spacious. 

Really, the only bad thing about my Honda is the color.  I wanted a green car because it looks nice.  But the dirt shows very easily, so I find myself at the car wash quite often.  I would recommend getting a lighter color for that reason.

I think this car is one of the most versatile cars to own.  It's perfect for families with children.  It's also a nice investment for someone who's just graduated from college, starting out with a new job.  Since it is very reliable, I think people who depend on their car for work should have no qualms about buying the Accord.  As it is reasonably stylish, I think the younger folk can feel comfortable/cool driving it as well.   <br><br>
