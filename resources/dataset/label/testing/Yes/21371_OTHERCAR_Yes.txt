            This is my first Japanese car and what I think of MOST when i think of this car is one word, "tough".  I don't know a lot about the engineering involved but what I do know is this:

While driving on the HOV lane at the speed limit I hit a large piece of metal.  I was not sure at the time how much damage was done because it was dark.  The car drove fine so I thought noting more of it.  In fact, I drove back and forth from NY to NH the following weekend.  It was not until I drove through a large puddle and the carpet got soaked that I took the car in for service.  Well I was amazed at how much damage was done.  A large hole was ripped in the metal and I don't know the name of the part but it was attached to the wheel and was twisted around like a pretzel.  The bill for the repair came to $6,000 and even with all that damage the car drove like nothing was wrong.  It didn't even pull to one side!

Now, I can't be sure this is super engineering or dumb luck but I was still impressed.  I would also note that there is a way to tell if your model is built in Japan and that is if the VIN begins with a J.  Mine was built in Japan and circa 1999 that may be the place one would want to have a Camry made.  The car gives one the feel of confidence and I have little doubt it will run 100,000 miles easy.

The performance of the V-6 is adequate but please do not buy this car if you are looking for a sport sedan.  There is nothing at all sporty about this car.  It is a super-reliable machine to get you safely from point A to point B.  You're not going to be having much fun driving this car but if you're out of your 20s then that may not really be much of a concern anymore anyway.  As a med-school student I needed something that will last me a trouble-free 5-6 years and I found it.
