            We bought this car because it was in our price range, had 4 doors, and airbags.  My last car was a '91 Ford Festiva, so when I saw on this page that the Neon is classified as a compact, I laughed.

  When my husband and I had our baby, we knew we'd need a safer car.  We wanted a 4-door so we could get her into and out of her carseat easily.  She's almost 2 now, and I put her in the car and she walks over to her carseat, which is in the middle of the back seat (the safest place in a car for it).  In the Festiva, she would have had to be behind one of the front seats.  And there's still room for an adult to sit on each side of her.

  We really enjoy our Neon.  The tilt steering makes it easy for me to get in and out of the car.  I'm 5'2&quot; and don't feel short in this car.  The seats move way back, too, so a tall person probably wouldn't feel cramped, either.  The seat belts in the front seats are adjustable, so if you're short you can put them at the bottom of the track and it won't cut into your neck.  If you're tall, you can put it at the top and it will fit like it should.

  I like where the buttons for the cruise control are, on the inside of the steering wheel.  It's very easy to set and cancel.  The trunk is bigger than you would think, and the back seat splits so you can fold all or part of it down for more cargo room.  It doesn't split in the middle, though, but more of a 2/3 split, so someone can still sit back there if you only have one side down.

  I don't have any complaints about this car.  It's exactly what we wanted.  Ours is white and it's still beautiful!<br><br>
