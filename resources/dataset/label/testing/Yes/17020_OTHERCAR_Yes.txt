            	I purchased the Durango after my wife and I found out we were moving from Augusta, Georgia (Fort Gordon) to Anchorage, Alaska (Fort Richardson).  With two kids about to enter the �soccer� stage, we needed good seating and good storage room.  The area made four-wheel drive a much-desired choice, so an SUV was the obvious answer.
	After extensive driving of my original choice, the Tahoe/Yukon and the Suburban, we decided to try out a Durango.  At first the styling did NOT appeal to me, but it quickly grew on my wife and me.  After 13 months and 27,000 miles later here is what I have found:

1)	Purchasing full-time four-wheel drive (4WD) was a good idea.  The ability to keep the truck in 4WD on alternating icy and not icy roads without worrying about wearing out the tires due to excessive scrub is a key feature.  What good is a 4WD vehicle if you are in 2WD when you need it most?
2)	5.9 L vs. 5.2 L engine.  I test drove both, and honestly noticed little difference.  They are both poor in gas mileage, and both are very quick for such a heavy vehicle.  However, the 5.9 has a greater resale value, and allows you to tow and/or rent much larger towing equipment at national rental agencies.  Good for trips from Georgia to Alaska, which is why I got the 5.9.  Final opinion � worth it.
3)	3rd seat.  Don�t buy one without it.  If you don�t know why, you don�t need this truck.
4)	Large gas tank (25 gallons).  Hmm.  Doesn�t seem so large at 10-12 mpg.
5)	Larger wheels.  Noisier, but look sharp and increase the road clearance a bit.  If you are just going to tow your bass boat around in nice roads, don�t waste your money.  The larger wheel/tire combo is louder and harsher than the standards, not to mention more expensive to replace when you blow one out.
6)	Ceiling mounted rear air conditioner.  Great in Georgia.  Asinine in Alaska.  A rear heater would be sweeter. (Sorry)
7)	Fog lights have blown out three times in one year.  Still under warranty, but what a pain in the butt.  Still, that is my major complaint.  My wife thinks the truck is noisier than when new, but so am I, and she still keeps me around.  I haven�t noticed, and I guarantee it is as quiet or quieter than any other SUV on the market.
8)	Made the Alaska Highway in late December an absolute dream.  Hardly anybody on the road but me, and the truck was made for that kind of trip.  Just bring two 5-gallon cans of gas with you, because the truck is a gas hog (have I mentioned that yet?)  I can�t think of a more supportive comment than this.  To take a vehicle, load it down, tow a trailer, and yet still make it through the Arctic in the middle of winter in absolute comfort � what else could you ask for? (Except maybe a rear heater.)
