            For sure, this is not my grandfather's ordinary vehicle!
Call this SUV the new generation's automobile or call it the new hip hop toy on the market right now.  Whatever you agree to call it, the common point will be that the 2002 Cadillac Escalade has a huge following among SUV lovers who look for convenience, strong appeals, styles and comfort.  Just a few weeks earlier, one of my buddies from the local dealership called to ask if I have already test-driven the Escalade.  All my mind could refer to was the sound that could rhyme with the new song Lady Marmelade.  After a few seconds, my friend added that he has been having a lot problems keeping a few of them around the parking lots.  The one that has been in the showroom attracts a bunch of young kids who don't want to get out of the driver's seat area.  Then, it dawned on me that I must go down to find out for myself.  I must admit that the first time I saw the 2002 Cadillac Escalade at a stop light, I missed my right turn light.  No wonder I got a few other drivers angry!  But, they did not honk their vehicle's horn.  I guess we were all being petrified and taken to another domain by this new hot SUV.  I was not the only guy to take a deep look at this truck.  The female driver/owner of the Escalade caught me looking at her SUV.  She may have thought I was interested in her too.  Well, she was fine too!

<b>What did I find out during my test driving experience?</b>

Before I test-drove this 2002 Cadillac Escalade, I used to have this nasty attitude against behemoth vehicles.  All I could think of them was that they were huge steel boxes whose drivers terrorize and frighten car or small or compact vehicles drivers on the roads.  After test-driving a few other Navigators, Ford Excursion, if I was on the market for an SUV, I would pick the Escalade.  I found myself behind the steering wheels of a 4-speed automatic, V8 2002 all wheel drive base Cadillac Escalade.  Keep in mind that this model comes in 5.3 L, 8 Cyl. and 6.0 L, 8 Cyl.  What you pay for them to get them out of the dealership makes the difference too.  In addition, if you intend to do some custom works on it, you can stand to spend a few more thousands.  There again, it's up to your own tastes!

<i>What are some of the benefits for the vertically-endowed people out there?</i>

If you are a tall person, you don't have to worry about fitting all your frame into this SUV.  Take this from me.  I had no problem at all being comfortable on this SUV.  With a 10-way power driver seat, you can make yourself as comfortable as you want.  One more nice feature is that your beloved passenger can start tasting the type of comfort you have come to benefit from this Escalade.  Any passengers can have access to this feature.  I had enough leg and head room.  The rear seats and the trunk areas are very spacious too.  I guess one of the most interesting external features that attracts everybody is the deep black color of the Escalade.  You can select your pick since it comes in other colors too.  I test-drove black one.  Of course, after I filled out all the identification paperwork (driver's license, proof of insurance etc), I was sent out with one of the sales people who drove the truck to an area where test-driving is allowed.  During the relatively short drive, I did not hesitate to ask about the other protection features that this SUV comes equipped with.  Cruise control, side seat-mounted airbag, climate control, 17" alloy wheels, 4-wheel ABS and great audio system are all the great features you can find on this SUV.  You will find a combination of all the standard and optional features on this truck.

<i>Why do you want to invest so much money in such an SUV?</i>

Two guys who own an Escalade become instant celebrities in the eyes of their acquaintances and friends.  Wherever they go, they get asked all kinds of questions by regular, pure strangers.  It makes sense that most entertainers and athletes including NBA stars and rappers have a great affinity for these vehicles.  I guess most ordinary Joes and Janes who bought this vehicle suddenly find themselves in the spotlight which celebrities have known all along. 

There is no doubt that Cadillac has struck it huge with this upwardly mobile market niche.  African-Americans are buying the Escalades a lot.  These young hip hop artists, rappers, NBA and Football players know what it is like to be perceived as being rich.  It's all an attitude thing.  Let's hope that they invest their money wisely.  After all, why shouldn't they taste the fruits of their hard labor with a nice SUV such as the Escalade?  Hey guys and girls, pamper yourselves.  Shower yourselves with toys you did not grow up with.  By the way, owning such a great car is part of the realization of the American dream for many.  Your American dream may be a great home, a great car, beach-front property, and owning stocks in prosperous companies.  

What's your American Dream like?  An Escalade is more like it, don't you think?  A surprise gift idea for your loved one this holiday season!
