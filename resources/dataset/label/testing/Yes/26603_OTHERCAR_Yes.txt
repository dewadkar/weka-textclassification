            I bought this car at a dealers auction and i cant say it is bad.
i got it in fall 98 and at 100k miles. it needed some minor maintanace and overall it is ok.
the air system is givinig me major headaches and the transmission needs to be rebuilt, i guess that can be expected but it was taken care of as there is no sign of accidents or leakage anywhere.
i think it is a good car for someone who needs a large vehicle like for kids and such but doesnt want a minivan or suv. but on the other hand if you like small cars (which i do) it feels very large.
the trunk is great you can fit the entire house in there with room for the neighbor.
over all it is a good used car and it seems to be holding up to my comute with not too much money to put in.
