            When I decided that I wanted to get into the digital camera market, I was initially overwhelmed with the choices that I had.  After doing a great deal of research on features and price, I came upon the Hewlett Packard C200 Photo Smart.  In my opinion, it is one of the best values in digital cameras on the market today.

Most importantly, in my opinion, the camera has Compact Flash technology. This feature enables one to take a large number of pictures without changing &quot;disks.&quot;  An 8mb disk comes with the camera, enabling you to take between 17 and 80 photos, depending on the resolution chosen.  You can buy disks with memory up to 192mb, which will hold a lot of pictures.

The camera is relatively easy to use, but I wish the buttons were larger and easier to manipulate.  I have found the photo quality to be excellent, at 1 mega pixel for the high resolution setting.  The camera does have an LCD screen, an important feature, allowing you to see you picture when taken.  The camera has auto flash, red eye reduction, auto focus and the ability to turn these off.  In addition, there is a timer feature.  There is limited (2X) zoom capability, but that doesn't bother me, much.  Camera exposure is automatic, but may be overridden

The Photo Smart software that comes with the camera is easy to use, and includes editing, photo show and other features.  The camera can be downloaded into your computer, or you can buy the San Disk ImageMate reader, which transfers the photos from the Compact Flash disk to the computer at a much faster rate.  This camera also has the capability to show your photos on your television screen.  

Like most digital cameras, this one is a battery eater, so the optional AC adapter is advised.  I also invested in NiMH rechargable batteries.  The bad part is that the adapter is proprietary and retails for $50 from HP.  I found it on the web for about $38. 

All in all, I am pleased with my purchase.<br><br>
