            I will start by saying this camera takes excellent pictures.  At super high quality, it takes 1280x960 pixel images, and with the included 8MB Smartmedia card, you can fit 18 photos at SHQ.  If you take pictures at lower quality, like High Quality, HQ (800x600), or Standard Quality, SQ (640x480), you can fit more.  

Another thing I would like to mention is that the smartmedia card is incredibly small.  It is basically as thin as a credit card, or thinner, and about 2&quot; x 3&quot; or so.  You could fit many in your wallet, easily.  The small size could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it.  They are far from bulky, and easy to carry many, but I bet you could lose one very, very easily.  

It would be much better with optical zoom.  Digital zoom is better than nothing, but it amounts to cropping the image and enlarging it, something you can do yourself in any decent graphics program.  The shutter speed is also slow.  My dad tried to take pictures of dolphins surfacing, and in 3 attempts, he missed in all of them.  The dolphins had already resubmerged, and we got pictures of water.  

The battery life is short, and even shorter when you use the LCD screen.  With the serial connection it uses, photo transfer is a bit slow.  SHQ photos take around 30 seconds to load to the computer each.  This may not sound too bad, but when transferring many pictures, it takes a long time.

Overall, a nice camera for the price.<br><br>
