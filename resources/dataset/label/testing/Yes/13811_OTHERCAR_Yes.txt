            The Mercedes S-Class is one of the best cars to come out of Germany in a while.  The old S-Class was very big and seemed to heavy. The new 2000 design changed all this. Mercedes made the car curvier and more appealing. It doesn't look nearly as big as the old generation but it is actually bigger on the inside. The engine is cleaner but the hp was cut to 302 for the 5.0 L and the 4.3 L stayed at 275. This really doesn't matter because over 500 pounds were cut from the body.  The car has a lot of cool gizmos.  A GPS Navigation system is standard and the car phone is voice activated. Seats are heated and cooled and are also 18 way power seats.  A very nice option is Distronic, if the car is set in cruise and the car in front of you brakes, the Mercedes also brakes and maintains a good distance.  The interior is massive,the dashboard is very curvy. The wood looks nice and the Nappa leather is very nice to sit on. The true benefits of the S-Class are for people in the back seat,it is simply put, HUGE.  There is plenty of leg room.  Both models in the line have nice engines that provide excellent pick-up.  The list of standard features is very long. The only options that are essational are the moon roof and the cell phone w/ cd player.  The only problem I have with the car is that Mercedes still expects buyers to give over 2000 dollars for a cd player with cell phone. A 77K car should come standard with these features.  The interior has a little plastic which is a little annoying to look at.  Any one who can afford this car should buy it.  It has a very nice ride and is also very safe. There are over 8 air bags in this car.  The base price for the S500 is 77K while the S430 is around 72K. This may seem expensive but these are drastic price cuts compared to the older generation. The Mercedes S-Class are the finest automobiles in the market.  Some people compare it to the Lexus LS 400, but this is like comparing apples and oranges. The BMW 740iL and 750iL are the nearest competitors but right now the S-Class is much better because it is brand new and the 7-Series isn't going to be remodeled for three more years. This car is one of the best bargains in a long time!<br><br>
