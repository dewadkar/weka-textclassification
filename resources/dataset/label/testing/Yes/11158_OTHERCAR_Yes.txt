            I recently went with a friend of mine to purchase a 2001 Toyota RAV4.  I was skeptical of the car because of its compact size.  However, research from Consumer Reports and Crash Test results posted high scores.  Although, as one member of epinions has mentioned, the bumpers did not perform well in a 5 mph crash test.  Nonetheless, there were enough results to show that in a high speed 40 mph accident a person would have a good chance of surviving with few injuries.  Now that the car past my first criteria, I decided I would help my friend purchase the car.

The first time I looked at the car I noticed the style.  The RAV4 has a boxy, yet curved look which gives the car a sleek personality.  The headlights are triangular and the grill is small making them blend and contour to the shape of the overall car. The car continues to impress inside as well as outside.

The first thing I noticed were the large door frames.  Being 5' 10 I find getting into most compact cars a challenge.  Not with the Toyota.  In one swift move I was able to get into the driver's seat without bumping my right knee against the console.  Amble leg room that lacks in many compacts is found in the front seats of the RAV4.  If offered the driver the perfect combination of feeling elevated while being accomodating to get into.  I also saw someone 5' have the same ease.  Once inside I eyed everything.

The seats are very comfortable.  Leather and fabric with leather trim are offered.  The seats were very unique in their movements.  Adjustments included the typical seat sliding toward the front or rear and the back of the chair reclinig.  However, using a knob the chair adjusted completely to become either a buckseat or a benchseat.  For people like my parents who buy only older cars because they love benchseats, this option bridges a generation gap.  Very clever!  The seats, however, weren't as fun to play with as the other features.

The cars controls were very simply displayed and easily accessible.  The car comes with AM/FM/CD, with an optional 6 CD changer.  The sound quality is great, but if you want to make adjustments to the bass, treble, and balance options you will have to rely on only one button.  The climate controls all have their own buttons and are similar to ones found in any American car.  Other features include a console which is large enough to hold about six CD's, but that's it.  It has a very small opening.  Many of the other features are located on the steering column.

On the steering column are three levers.  One controls the blinkers with the headlight controls as a knob on the end of the lever.  The other two are on the right side of the steering column.   One controls the wipers and is where the transmission lever would be.  So, if you are like me and not used to the transmission gear being in the middle of the front seats, you will clean the windows.  On the knob of the lever is the control for the rear wiper.  The third lever is used to adjust the steering wheel.  The wheel itself felt small if you are used to American made cars.  Now, to get this baby on the road.

When the car started I hardly noticed it was running.  The car shifts out of park very smoothly.  The ride is solid and relatively quiet.  The hood's design allows the driver to see more of the road and exuberates the elevated feeling.  The steering was accurate.  I never felt as though I had to struggle or readjust the car's movement.   The best was the pickup.  For a four cylinder the car could go.  Never felt like I might have to get out and push.  Gas was loose and the brakes were very sensitive.  It takes awhile to get used to them, but who cares.  With 24 mpg city and 30 mpg on highway you can take all the time you need.  However, the passengers in the back seat might complain.

The back seats are firm, but comfortable.  For adults, however, the leg room leaves a bit to be desired.  I will say that the RAV4 offers the most in its class.  The door frames are the ones I dreaded.  I felt it was a struggle to get in and even more of a hassle to get out.  Overall, the shorter they are, the happier back passengers will be.  If you do not have any rear passengers, the car does offer a lot of cargo space.  Seats fold down flat and can accomodate large loads.  Also, a roll out cover, like pull-down shades, except vertically, is built into the car so you may cover your more precious cargo.  Without the seats folded down, the car still offers some impressive storage.  

It may look small, but once you load bags of groceries into it, you see just how much it can hold.  One possible drawback is that the rear door doesn't open up, but out.  Very convenient until you have to parallel park and need access.  The door makes-up for the design by having the spare wheel on the back of the door, rather than underneath the car, a very nice feature if you are stuck.  However, if the battery is the reason for the car breaking down, beware!

The car battery is crammed in a corner, rather than up front like many US cars.  Special tools, which are provided, are need to access the battery.  Also, should you need a jump, you'll have to go underneath the car to access the connectors.  I would say this is the only real design flaw.
