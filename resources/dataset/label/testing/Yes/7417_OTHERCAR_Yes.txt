            With all of the digital cameras out there, I was looking for one that gave an extreme ease of use as well as a good zoom ability.  With this Z3, the optical zoom is the same as the pentax optio s lens at 3x - this digital can zoom!  

What is most impressive of this camera is the size.  It's not too big, not too small, yet the LCD on the back is the largest I've seen on almost any camera!  At 2 inches, this LCD screen is bright and vivid, allowing for a good sense of whether or not a good picture has been taken.

I found that the ease of use was also impressive.  The reason I bought this camera over others was the ease of use and how easy it is to navigate through the pictures with the simple knowledge of the menu system and the buttons.  I bought this camera for my mother who has been wanting a digital cam for a while.  I know that her sense of technology isn't so good - so the Exilim was a good choice.  The LCD also helps in this situation with older people not being able to see small things easily.

With this camera, there are a few things that could be done better.  I found that you can't use BOTH the internal memory of 10megs as well as the SD card of 64 megs that I bought at the same time.  You can use only one or the other, but not both.  Also, the docking station needs to be taken with you whenever you want to charge it while you travel.  The dock station is rather large, but gives people who are not techno savvy a good footprint to which photos can be uploaded and where the camera can be charged.  

All in all, the pictures are extremely sharp and are great for the fun-traveller-who-wants-digital photos.  It's small enough and power packed to give your photos a definite professionalism, especially with the BEST SHOT feature which gives specific modes for specific situations (night shots, indoors, candle lit birthday cakes in the dark, fireworks... etc).  I love the software on this camera for the ease of use and the wonderful optical zoom.  For an all around camera, this is the one to get!
