            If you simply have to have an economy car in this class, and you refuse to buy into the Honda and Toyota hype, then I think Ford Focus is the way to go.

Ford is simply a legendary car company.  The Ford T-Bird and the Ford Mustang are stylish and classic.  The Ford Taurus is solid and sleek and always a bestseller.  All the wealthy people I know who are into SUVs don't go for anything but an Explorer, even with more expensive and prestigious SUVs out there.  And, my best friend is still driving a 1988 Escort (The car the Focus is replacing) which is running great.  So, I would think the Focus would have at least as good reliability as the Escort, which was a great car.  Quite simply, everybody I know drives Fords, except for me in my Corolla which I loaned to visiting friends for a month in August who decided to take my Corolla for sight-seeing up the coast, and left me with the Ford Focus they rented.  Obviously, I'm a really generous friend, or really crazy.

Actually, I had a really fun month in the Ford Focus.  It is very fun to drive and very good looking with the outside styling---all the things that weren't important to me when I went to actually -buy- two years ago.  Still, there is a lot of power to this car:

STEERING:  My Corolla which tends to be very sedate and usually wobbles around turns.  This isn't the case with the Focus.  The Focus has no body roll whatsoever around curves and I found myself actually flooring the gas pedal around turns because the Focus suspension is that smooth with no rolling.

BRAKES:   Surprising that they put front disc breaks into a car of this class.  They are noisy, but maybe that's how disc brakes are supposed to be.  Of course, lazy me, does no maintenance so maybe they just needed brake fluid.  I guess, for safety reasons and because drivers of the Focus were going to be relatively young, Focus needed to have good braking.  Clearly these are the best brakes of any car  I've ever driven, just remember:  That's not a reason to drive recklessly, which I had to keep reminding myself throughout the month.

GAS MILEAGE AND GAS TANK:   My Corolla gets 29-30 mpg, so I expect at least as much from any small car.  The Focus gets 25, which was a disappointment and it seemed like I was always having to fill up.  In all fairness, it was the Summer and what with using the air-conditioning a lot, maybe that takes up more fuel.

Here's a pet-peeve of mine:  The Focus gas tank does not lock.  I would think you want a gas tank that locks and can only be opened from the outside the way Corolla, and pretty much all other cars' do.  Maybe this isn't a major thing, but if you have weird friends who like to play pranks and fill your gas tank with water, then you definitely want a tank that locks!

INSIDE FURNISHINGS AND LACK OF ARMREST:    The Corolla is slightly more plush than the Focus.  And this definitely mattered to me as I am obsessed with such trivialities like say, fluffiness of the rug and if all instruments and furnishings match in color.

For one thing, there's no center console or center armrest in, at least, the model of the Focus I drove.  I always think that I am 100 years old and am always looking for an opportunity to rest my weary arms.  Obviously this is why I bought something slightly more sedate and basic, more or less, like a Corolla.  Still, even the emergency brake in the Focus is covered and wrapped in this ugly pouch instead of just coming out of a luxurious center console.

STORAGE SPACE:  The lack of a center console also contributes to a lack of storage space in the Focus.  You might thing storage space doesn't matter...until you realize how much stuff, doo-dads, brick-a-brack, and junk you can accumulate.  I'm the original pack-rat and I really treasure all the nooks and crannies my Corolla has to store and throw my junk---which the Ford Focus, surprisingly doesn't have.

HOWEVER:  I have such a soft-spot in my heart for Fords, that, if I were determined to by a small car and I would buy American only....Focus would be it.

Certainly this is a better car than, say the Mazda Protege.  And as for the VW Jetta?  Well, the price of the Jetta would knock that out of the running for me.  For a whole month, I did absolutely no maintenance on the Focus.  I, the original lazy bones, do no maintenance on cars anyway...I mean nothing except get gas.......and clearly, you can get away with this in something like a Corolla or Focus.  Whereas with a Jetta, I think you have to put a little more effort into caring for it.

Oh, I wanted to say something about the fantastic Focus stereo system.  It seemed like anytime I wanted to listen to music the only optimal place to hear it was in the Focus.  Even if I wasn't going anywhere, I'd choose the Focus's stereo system over the one in my home!

If you just don't like Toyota, or you have a thing about only buying American (Even though the Focus is really European styled) then I would say, go for it, and get a Focus!
