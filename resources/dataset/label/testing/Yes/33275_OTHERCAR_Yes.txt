            My 70 year old grandparents own a 1998 Plymouth Voyager.  The room, seats, and overall driving experience are good for a short wheel base van.  The 3.0 litre SOHC mitsubishi designed V6 is very loud, but performs decently for a heavy minivan.  It delievers good acceleration and passing power.  The dual sliding doors are the greatest thing ever on a minivan, I don't know why they didnt come out with them sooner.  With the 2 back seats removed it offers cavernous cargo capacity, great because my grandparents visit flea markets and garage sales often.  The stereo is rather good also.  The paint quality could use improvement though, because even the smallest stones chip the paint.  The van they bought is a $20,000 base model short wheel base.  It's only options are power locks, A/C, 3.0 150hp SOHC V6, cassette player, and a roof rack.  The interior is still too plasticy at this price.  Everyhting from the dash to the sides are pure, cheap plastic.  Overall, this a good van though for a family on a budget.  But check out the 2001 models, I hear they are magnificent.<br><br>
