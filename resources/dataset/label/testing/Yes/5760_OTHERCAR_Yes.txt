            On the birth of my first child, my wife insisted that I trade in my Porsche (a 944S2 Convert.) for a more practical car. Swinging the complete opposite direction, I bought a Volvo T5R estate car. I loved it � I swear it was quicker than the Porsche - but nine months later, and totally encouraged by said wife who thought the Volvo looked too suburban, I bought a �91 911 C4 Cabrio. One year later, I upgraded to a �96 C4 Coupe.

Between the two cars, Porsche had wrought a lot of changes � the first one was a 964 model, with the 250bhp engine and mechanical four wheel drive, while the later model � a 993 � had 275 bhp, and more adaptive four wheel drive. 
Obviously, there were a ton of other modifications, but really, the most noticeable in use was that the trunk was fractionally larger. The increase in capacity was fractional, but believe me, it makes a difference when every square inch is at a premium!

OK, so what is owning one of these cars like? Anyone with an interest has read what these cars are like, so I�ll concentrate on the realities of ownership and use. 
Well, the 964 was in Tahoe blue (a real bright metallic colour), with a linen (white) leather interior. On 17-inch wheels with Continental tyres, it was very much an attention grabber. Thankfully, it went a lot more seriously than it looked. 

However, I had to use this one for some long distance commuting for a while, and I began to wonder about the sense of such a car. It was extremely quick, (0-60 mph in less than 5.5 secs), handled superbly (see below), but was really a bit of a pain to drive all the time. 
I didn't want to have to concentrate and work so hard every time I got into it. Sometimes, I just wanted to let the car take some of the strain.

Regarding its handling, I'd had some fears about the 911�s tail-happy reputation, and having once owned a �57 356, I was wary that the later car would be similarly wayward. 
If you�re put off a 911 because of this reputation...
Don't be. 

Example. When I first got the car, I drove it fairly hard, and on a fairly sharp right hander I glanced down at the speedo and noticed I was doing 90mph. Fear took hold, and reflexes made me brake. Not sharply, but down to about 65. This is well documented as the very worst thing you should do in a rear-engined Porsche on a corner. So what happened? Well, nothing at all. It just carried on round the corner. 

I�m sure that at 150mph things may have been different, but this is a road car here, on a road, and if I were doing 150mph on a corner on a road, then I think I�d deserve a hefty crash. Point being, do not be put off my motoring journalists� scare stories. 

This particular convertible 911 had the optional �remote closure� locking/alarm. This is a superb trick. 
Leave the car hood down and windows open. 
Then push a button on the key fob, and it closes up all on its own. 
The roof is particularly impressive because it is completely automatic. No handles or latches on the header rail to bother about. 

An automatically closing car is a most impressive sight, and should really be perfomed nonchalently by the owner, but you just can�t be that casual about it. Two reasons � 

1. You never quite trust it to happen, so you have to watch it to be certain and secure, and
2. It�s just so good to watch that you�d be a fool to walk away. 
Standing and watching does rather negate its benefits.

But now here�s the rub - brought home by the commuting time � the car was a pain to live with in normal conditions. 

The clutch is too heavy. 
It feels like it�s got no flywheel � try pulling away cleanly without the rev counter going 100 � 4000 � 700. You just can�t � the throttle is on a hairspring. 
You can�t park it without fear of vandalism or worse, 
In traffic it�s loud and uncomfortable. 
Given that these days traffic is about the only thing you see on roads, I started to hanker for something easier. 

Hence a later 993. A few things brought about this purchase. 

1. It was a coupe, so rear 3/4 visibility, which is non-existent in the cabrio, was superb.
2. It was dark green, so I didn�t feel like a pimp
3. It had a 6-speed gearbox, 
3. It was newer, and was the last of the air-cooled 911s, etc etc.

The 993 knocks spots off the 964. It is much easier to drive well. 
The gearbox is a delight; the servotronic steering � a particularly strong point on all 911s is even better on the 993. Perfect weight, terrific feel, totally accurate. I have never driven a car with such good steering. 
Performance and handling were as good as the 964 (I�m sure they are better really, but I never found out � the thing�s limits are so high, that I never got near them�).

Everything I liked about the 964 was better in the 993. And as an unexpected bonus � I didn�t need a child seat in the back. 
The stock seats are so small and well bolstered that a seat belt adapter was all it took to safely secure a two-year-old.

Downsides to my 993? Well, the interior was coal-hole black (including the roof lining) so it could be a bit oppressive, and the rear arches are so wide that you get a mirrorfull of them when you look behind, making narrow gaps a bit hair raising.
And the rear wiper squeaks like a demon. 
Small complaints, I have to say.

I would recommend either of these four wheel drive beauties, but for any prospective purchaser, I do have a couple of tales to tell � maybe not indicative of the cars as a whole � and only based on experience � but nonetheless...

Porsches are meant to be �everyday supercars�. 
True you can use them every day, but beware of their immoboilsers (the ones with the separate electronic key). I had this system (Porsche System 1 alarm/immobiliser) on my 944, the 964, and the 993. 
Every one of them failed at least twice � leaving me totally stranded, and every one had to be replaced (thankfully under warranty). 
And I don�t think they�re that effective anyway � Once, when stranded, a local garage mechanic came to the rescue and he bypassed it in seconds. Now if he can do it, I�m sure someone who steals cars for a living can�

Also, on the 993 (again under warranty, to be fair) The driver�s seat motor failed, the sunroof motor failed, and worst of all � the gearbox seized. This cost (Porsche) over �8000. 
You do the math for dollars. 
This car was less than three years old, and had 21000 miles on it. Hmm.

So the killer question I guess is, would I have another one?

And the answer is sadly �Yes�. In no other car have I quite had such a thrill. Just looking at them (particularly the coupe) is a dream, and that steering just has to be tried to be believed. 

But as they say, buy the best one you can afford, and get a warranty.
