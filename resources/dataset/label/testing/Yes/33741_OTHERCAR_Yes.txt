            I bought my '95 Maxima in 1999 and have loved it ever since. These are my observations to those who are considering this super vehicle.

Fuel Economy 
I get about 28 mpg on the highway and can go for 425 miles on a tank. In the city, I only get about 17 mpg. The powerful acceleration is worth the drop-off in mileage to me.

Interior 
Good space inside, can easily seat 4 or 5 comfortably. The dash is a little plasticy to me but nothing like a Grand Am's dash. The instrumentation is well placed and the steering is comfortable. Maxima has a nice large, usable center console/arm rest that holds a ton of CDs and other things. My biggest complaint about the car is that the front seats strain your lower back on long trips. This drives some people, like my wife crazy.

Sound System
Probably one of the best manufacturer sound systems you can get. There are better aftermarket systems but the Maxima's is loud enough for me and much better than our Mazda 626's system.

Power plant 
This is the primary reason to buy this vehicle. The engine is truly in a class of its own. I have friends who have spent more than double on their cars only to have weaker power and slower vehicles. 

Handling 
The handling is better than average but not BMW. This is the trade-off between the really high end sports cars and the Maxima. My car corners fine and grips the road well but the ride can be a bit bouncy and airy on the highway. 

Styling
The Maxima has refined conservative styling. It doesn't scream hey, look at me!!! It is distinctive enough that it stands out from all the other 4 door sedans. The term 4 door sports car does apply as the car is sharp and sporty compared to its peers. My Maxima is 8 years old and I still get comments on how great it looks.

Noise level 
Extremely quiet. The engine is soooo quiet that when I first got my Maxima, I tried to start it while the car was running because I thought it had stalled. It really is that quiet!!

Reliability 
The car has been very reliable. Other than oil changes and brakes, the only other thing that I have had to replace was the battery at 75k, I now have 90k and the car is as silky smooth as when I first bought it. I am hoping to get 200k out of mine. 

BTW - if you should encounter the dreaded check engine light, generally due to a defective O2 sensor, try this money-saving trick before taking yours to the dealer. Unplug the battery for over 24 hours, if it doesn't come back on, it was a glitch if it does then take your car in. 

Another interesting item, insurance on this car is surprisingly cheaper than its peers (Accord and Camry). I asked my agent and she said that the car was heavier and therefore safer and that the Maxima generally attracts a more conservative/professional market segment than other fast cars.

Overall 
If you want the most car for your money, its hard to beat the Maxima. It does so many things well its just a super car!!
