            I have just purchased a '96 Camry XLE and I love it.  It has all of the qualities of a luxury car without the cost.  I was able to get a sunroof, leather seats, alloy wheels, CD player, and the gold package for under 16,000.  The car only had 45,000 miles on it and it runs great.  A year ago I purchased a '92 Camry LE and it still runs great with 118,000 miles on it.  I still own both cars and will stay with Toyota because they seem to offer great cars and quality cars.  The only trouble I have had is with the valve seals.  When they go bad the car smokes on start-up and looks like you are burning oil.  The parts aren't expensive its just the labor to replace them that is.<br><br>
