            How many people can say that driving is always exciting?  Not too many as far as I can tell.  Ever since I bought my Acura Integra LS 4-door, I enjoy going to the store and picking people up.  I've listed the top ten reasons to own an Acura Integra 4-door.

1.   Available power-The torque in the lower gears is far superior than that of other compacts.
2.   Handling-Depending on the model, you can pass people around a curve and not even get nervous.
3.   Looks-The body style hasn't changed for 6 years--that's got to mean something.
4.   Instrument panels-Laid out exactly how I would design them.  Very comfortable and sleek.
5.   Reliability-I've only had to take the car to the shop once in almost three years (other than routine maintenance).
6.   Fuel economy-If you don't drive it too hard you can get around 30 miles to the gallon and not lose any power.
7.   Roomy-I am six foot four and I even fit in the back seats without a problem.
8.   Gear shift-The gears are so close together, it's like a Porsche.
9.   Resale value-I've had offers to buy my car for almost as much as I paid for it and they are in demand.
10.  Durability-This car can take a beating but I would advise you not to do so.

I've had quite a few cars and I can't even begin to compare any to the Acura Integra.  It is an all around good deal and will always excite you when you drive it.  <br><br>
