            3 day test drive:

DATA: 1998 A4 1.8T QUATTRO, 4 door, std, leather seats,
sunroof.

I recently had the opportunity to test drive an Audi A4 1.8T
QUATTRO.  On a scale from 1-10, I would rate it a solid 8.5.
I have been comparing different mid-size AWD cars because I
am interested in purchasing one for the following year.  I
will be writing another review of the Subaru Impreza Outback
as well.

The Audi is a great car.  It is easy to drive, the seats
were black leather and very comfy.  I was able to turn
sideways to look behind into the back seat easily because
the seats don't hug the body as much as the ones in my
current honda CRX do.  

ENGINE:
The biggest suprise I had was that I didn't &quot;feel&quot; the turbo
in this car.  The last turbo charged car I drove was the
Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T which has a whopping turbo boost
that was truly thrilling to feel.  I was surprised when I
drove the Audi, because I didn't feel any turbo surge or
boost at all - it is clearly a very finely tuned and
integrated system because it just felt like the car had more
power than you might expect from a normal 4 cylinder
engine.   If this is what you are looking for, great.  For
myself, I kind of get-off on that surge you get from the
turbo.  The typical &quot;turbo&quot; warnings you get that tell you
to let the car cool for 30 seconds before shutting down were
also mysteriously absent.  If I hadn't known better, I would
almost have expected this car to be not a turbo at all, but a
small 6 cylinder.

INTERIOR:
I have heard a lot of people praising the interiors of the
Audis and how beatiful and elegant they are.   Well, perhaps
I was a bit too pumped up and was anticipating something
unrealistic, because I didn't think it was that amazing.  It
is, however, VERY nice.  Some tasteful layout and a few
creative little gizmos make you feel like you are in a car
that was clearly designed by some smart people.  I did find
a button on the wall behind the back seat that (like all the
other buttons in the car) had a symbol and no wording.  I
never found out what that button did, so there are a few
strange things in the layout that take some getting used
to.  It took us about 4 minutes to figure out how to turn on
the lights and another few minutes to figure out how to blow
air in defrost mode instead of cooling our feet.  There has
almost emerged a standard for how this is done in many other
cars, and Audi isn't really following it.  Other than the
few small gripes, it's very nice.

I play hockey, and hockey gear can take up a lot of room
(and be stinky).  I was happy to discover a spacious trunk
that easily held my hockey gear (but not my stick).  The
back seats are comfy as well, and the front seats have some
wacky controls to move them around, but are also very
comfortable.  

The doors are a bit troublesome though.  Heavy springs make
them leap out away from you and bang into the car next
door.  The driver's door does open quite wide though which
is nice (this car was a 4 door) - almost 90degrees!  The
final thing I have to say on the doors is that the locking
mechanisms they have are still as crappy as my old '85 GTI -
meaning, to lock the car, you have to get out, shut the
door, turn around, stick your key back in, and then turn it
the right way.  (This proved to be a pain in the butt when,
after I shut and locked the door, I realized I still needed
my bag in the back seat (unlock, open, hit unlock button,
open rear door, close rear door close front door, put key
back in and lock -all to get a bag!).

SUMMARY:
The 1.8T is a nice car.  A very nice German automobile which
feels quite good to drive and has plenty of power.  It
generally feels bigger than it actually is when you drive
it.  Often I was able to park it in spots in San Francisco
that I thought it would never fit into.  My very short
girlfriend was able to drive it without a problem since the
seat came far forward and had height adjustment as well. 
Although the shifting wasn't as tight and snappy as my CRX,
it was easy to do and the clutch was very smooth.  

The ultimate question to ask (at least for me) is whether this car is worth
the $28k plus price tag.  Or since it is viewed as a luxury car, whether it is worth the extra repair costs and insurance.  My old roomate who works in the
car industry says that Audi's have Tranny problems often,
and this datapoint was reinforced by a friend who had an
older A4 in the shop for 90 days(!) for tranny problems
(yes, it was a quattro).  

If you read http://www.eskimo.com/~eliot/awd.html, you will find out that Audi has a torque sensing all wheel drive system, which maybe superior to other systems on the market, but may be plagued with some of the problems discussed above.

That's the end.  Hope you found it useful!
