            THE 1997 IZUZU RODEO MAY SEEM LIKE A LUXERY SPORT UTILTY TRUCK BUT IT REALLY ISN'T.  i OWN A BLACK RODEO.  aT FIRST I WAS OVERWHELLMED WITH HAPPINESS THAT I WAS GOING TO BE A FRESHMEN IN HIGH SCHOOL DRIVING AROUND IN A CAR LIKE THAT BUT SOON AFTER I REALIZED I WAS OVEREXAGGERATING.  BESIDES BEING OVER $20,000, THE MONET THAT YOU WILL SPEND ON GAS IS REDICULOUS.  iT HAS GREAT FEATURES BUT HOWEVER THE WAY IT DRIVES CANCELLS ALL THE FEATURES OUT.  IT HAS A VERY HEAVY GAS PEDAL AND THE BRAKE IS TIGHT AS WELL.  SERIOUSLY, DONT GET THE RODEO.  PATHFINDERS AND GRAND CHEROKEES ARE AROUND THE SAME PRICE AND IM SURE THEY ARE 20 TIMES BETTER.  I AM GOING TO SELL MY RODEO OR WHATEVER I CAN GET FOR IT.  i DONT MEAN TO SEEM LIKE A SPOILED RICH BRAT, BECAUSE I AM NOT RICH BUT WHEN I BUY A CAR LIKE THAT I EXPECT TO LOVE IT LIKE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AND I DONT.  GO TO THE REAL RODEO BECAUSE THIS ONE IS NO ADVENTURE<br><br>
