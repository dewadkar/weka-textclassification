                  Let me start off by saying that I love this car.  While at first I was put off buy its golf chassis and yes, I admit it, I didn't like the looks, I have since come to change my views entirely.  The Turbo AWD has plenty of kick plus the added safety of AWD.  I've come to love the exterior almost as mush as I love the interior.  If I could I could have the designers of the TT interior redo my house in a second!  A small, but powerful, engine which gets great mpg and is still faster than a Boxter!  Looks that rival everything short of a Diablo!  What more could you ask for...nothing.

     If something isn't broken don't fix it.  I realize that Audi has had a number of reports from autobahn drivers saying that the car looses its handling prowess at speeds over 90 mph.  To rectify this Audi has redone the shock settings (an understandable move), and to my horror added a mandatory spoiler!  While I love spoilers on some cars, the Hennessey Viper comes to mind, especially when they're functional, F50, they just don't belong on some cars.  One's eyes can't help but follow the curves of the TT, its what the car is all about!  Adding a spoiler ruins the entire effect that made the TT, in my opinion, the best mid-priced roadster for sale!  In Germany where it is custom to go 130 mph on your way to work function overrides form, but here in the States where you better have a Valentine 1 to be going 80 its just not necessary.  Include it as an option if you wish, but this is something that would guide me away from the Audi dealer and into the cabin of a Z3.<br><br>
