            I recently had the opportunity to test drive the 2000 Buick LeSabre.  It is a full sized, 4-door car, much larger than anything I have ever owned.

The drive in the LeSabre is very smooth and quiet. I barely felt the bumps in the road. The handling was very tight. We went on a curvy, bumpy road on purpose, and it felt great. 

The interior was comfortable and well-appointed. There's plenty of room inside for taller people, even in the back seat. There's a digital compass built into the rear view mirror, and lots of neat little gadgets. At one point we were driving down the road and noticed that the speedometer was on 100! But we couldn't figure it out, we weren't passing anyone.  I was about to tell the dealer that the gauge was broken, then he pointed out the button that allows you to switch between miles and kilometers per hour. We pushed the button and the gauge dropped down to normal speed.

While I'm not going to be buying a car anytime soon, the LeSabre definitely impressed me. It's a comfortable, luxurious car at a reasonable price.<br><br>
