              I recently traded in a full size conversion van for a 2001 Nissan Sentra.  When I first got in the Sentra for a test drive I felt very low to the ground.  The salesperson said I was used to the big van and that most everything would seem low.  However, as I drive this car more and more I still feel like even regular mid size cars and even some compacts tower above me when driving.  It's kind of a sporty feel but if you're used to a little bigger car it's something to get used to.
  I intended on getting a typical commuter vehicle.  After getting 13-14 mpg in our big van I wanted something really cheap to run and pretty basic.  The problem was that Nissan has done such a good job of pricing this vehicle that it makes it tough to settle for the base model.  In the end, I got the SE model with performance package and added the power sunroof at the very end.  With the options I still ended up spending about what I would have for a lesser equipped Civic or Corolla.
  The SE model comes with the 2.0 liter SR20DE engine.  Although this is an older design then the 1.8 liter, it has been a solid performer for several years and has shown to be reliable.  It is also equipped with 16 valves and dual cams.  It is relatively quick off the line but it really shows it's strength at higher RPMs.  I travel an Interstate near my home where the speed limit is 70.  I realized I was only going about 60 so I punched it a little.  The car really takes off with the high RPMs and next time I looked down it was pushing 90.  The engine moved up quickly and smoothly without a surge, and even though this is a small car it purred really nicely at that high of speed.  Of course I backed down to 70 again quickly.  My only complaint about the engine that it is slightly louder than a Civic but that also lends to it's "sporty" feel.  Since I have a very slow commute many days I opted for the automatic transmission, the manual has slightly better pickup and gas mileage.
  This car was redesigned in 2000 and the styling has received varying opinions.  I think that it has a slightly more "classic" look to it and doesn't look quite as rounded as other cars in this class such as the Ford Focus.  Because I have the performance package I have a rear spoiler that I think Nissan did a nice job with.  It's well integrated into the overall flow of the car and doesn't look as out of place as on some sub 20K cars.
  The performance package also includes 16" Firestone tires which look great and handle even better.  My only complaint is that they are a 55 series which is not very common and may be expensive to replace.  They do fine on dry pavement but I'm afraid they are too wide to get some serious traction in a Minnesota snowstorm.  The roads are pretty clean here now but I'm anxious to see how the tires do next time it snows.  The front wheel drive will help but a 55 series tire may just be too wide for snow.
  The seating position is good, although a little too low for my taste.  The upholstery isn't very plush but the seats are comfortable and the decor of the entire cabin is very tasteful without a lot of gadgets.  Rear leg room would be tight for a 6 footer but my 2 kids do fine back there.  I also like that they included a lap and shoulder belt for the middle passenger in the back, usually that position only gets a lap belt.  The controls are easy to reach, intuitive, and well laid out.
  The package I bought came with the 180 watt stereo and cd player with 7 speakers, with one of these speakers being a subwoofer.  If you are looking at one of these cars, ask to look in the trunk and take a look below the rear shelf where the speakers are mounted.  You will see two normal looking speakers and between them the subwoofer.  This thing is HUGE.  Put on some music with bass and turn it up a little.  I was amazed at the depth of the bass and quality of the sound coming from this sound system.  In fact, driving down the road I was watching my outside mirrors shake as the low notes were hit.  This is bass you can hear and feel.
  The ride is comfortable but a little stiff.  This is partly due to the firm suspension and low profile tires.
  I originally tried to just get a commuter vehicle with a decent radio, but I kept looking at better and better equipped cars and the price just didn't seem to go up that much.  Finally, I found the car I wanted except it had a power sunroof I really didn't need.  Eventually, that got included in the price as well without raising my cost more than a few dollars.  In addition, the dealership I went to had a $500 auto show discount and 2.9% for 2 years or 3.9% for 3 years financing.  In the end I left with spending just a little more per month then I had originally planned on but drove away with a fully equipped car that I consider to be very nice.  I feel like I got a lot of car for my money.
  Even the warranty was a surprise.  In addition to the normal 3/36 bumper to bumper that most car companies have, they also have a 5/60 powertrain warranty which is becoming more and more uncommon.
  This car has good styling, a nice engine, and a good ride but remember you are still driving a "compact" car.  The ride isn't going to be as nice or as quiet as a larger car but for this price I'm not complaining.
  If you are looking for cheap transportation this vehicle may be for you.  Just remember that in the case of the 2001 Sentra, cheap doesn't need to mean no-frills, because this car has many.  I think it's a great value for this class of car.
