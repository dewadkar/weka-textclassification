            The suburban is one of the top 5 vehicles of all time.  I purchased my first suburban in 1998 and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is roomy enough for 8 for big families or if you prefer, remove the 3rd seat( which is optional) and you have a lot of cargo space. We especially enjoyed being able to go out with our friends for a night on the town and still have room for our little ones. Unfortunately, the doors are not very heavy and it rattles a little.  It handles well but the length will take some getting used to. My wife is 5'3&quot; and she even likes to drive it. It does give a commanding view of the road to the detriment of others.  I highly recommend the touring package which includes bilistine gas shocks which make for a surprisingly nice ride. Turns out, the new models will be called the Yukon XL (&quot;extra length&quot; )instead of the Suburban. I can't understand why after almost 70 years as the premier utility vehicle that they are going to change this household name.   <br><br>
