            My husband and I had been looking for an SUV for quite a while and had been researching many different lines. We were just about to purchase a Mitsubishi Montero because we have owned two other Mitsubishis that we were pleased with. Then I looked in the paper and saw a local Ford Dealer was having a sale on Expeditions. I wanted an SUV with a third seat and after seeing the small seats available in models like the Montero and Dodge Durango, the Expedition was very appealing. Not only did it have more room, but it sat up off the ground much more than the previous models we had looked at. Now when I park next to a Durango, I am looking at their roof and I'm thankful that we made the decision to buy our Expedition. 

We got a very good buy and I was surprised that we got the Expedition for about the same price as a Mitsubishi Montero, when I feel that the Ford is a much better value.  When we test drove the Expedition, we really didn't think we would buy it as the sticker price was far out of our range (about $34,000) However, when we returned to the dealership, the salesman explained that they were offering big discounts and we walked out of there paying about $7000 less than the stated price. We also got a very good options package such as heated mirrors and a six disc cd changer. Although we have not yet used our cargo rack, I am looking forward to taking a trip in our new vehicle. We have always driven small sports cars so this is a big change for both of us. It takes a while to get used to driving a larger vehicle, but the Expedition provides a much better field of view for highway driving. Also it is nice for people to actually see you and not cut you off or try to run you over when you are driving a smaller car.

I am pleased with the safety features that the Expedition offers. After Ford bought Volvo, they merged many of their safety features, providing  a very safe ride. However, the ride is not a fast one. I find that the Expedition lacks power. Being as the base model only has a 4.6 liter engine and carries a lot of weight it is slow to move. But it still guzzles gas. The V-8 Triton engine probably has something to do with that. I enjoy my new car, even though it is a little slow. The luxuries far outweigh the bad points.

After I bought my Expedition, my best friend and her husband decided to trade in their explorer for one of their own. They were impressed with the space and the quiet ride. We also like the fact that if more cargo room is needed the third seat can be removed or simply folded up.
