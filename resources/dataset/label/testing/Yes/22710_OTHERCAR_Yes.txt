            My wife and I bought our 1995 Plymouth Neon Sport in April of 1994 right from the factory.
This car has been one of the best small cars we have ever owned.
We have never had a problem with this car.  Note: this was the first year that the Neon was introduced into the market.
It's a standard which gives it a little more pep than the automatic.
This vehicle is great on gas, fun to drive handles the road great and is very comfortable. Great head and leg room with cab forward design.
The only thing I wish this car had was a little more space in the car....width wise.
We got a good deal on this car and have never regret purchasing it.
If I were to purchase another vehicle, I would not hesitate to look at the new Neon's next time.
My wife just loves driving this car.
So if you're in the market for a great little used car...definitely the 1995 Plymouth Neon is the way to go!!

Thanks Joe<br><br>
