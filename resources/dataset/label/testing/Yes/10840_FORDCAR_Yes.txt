            I bought this minivan about a year ago, and only had one major mechanical problem with it.  3 days after bringing this van home, the front spring busted through my front tire while I was driving.  (needless to say, I about had a heart attack right there).  The mechanic at the dealership did say that he got a bunch of 1998 Windstars in with broken springs, just like mine.  I really got angry about that, because I could have had my kids in the car with me, or been going at a high rate of speed.  So, I do believe that if there is that big of a problem with one certain aspect of a vehicle, the manufacturer should have the decency to do a recall.

Other than that, I have only had to   perform routine work on this vehicle.  Oil changes, brakes, and fill tires, the average stuff.

The interior as well as the exterior of this van is very appealing.  I have gotten numerous comments on how "nice"  of a van I have.  The seats are comfortable, easy to install car seats into.  The kids love the power windows in the back, and I like the fact that they only open a couple of inches, so I don't lose any of my munchkins on a road trip!

I do not care for the "ride"  in this vehicle.  I feel it too bouncy.  I did get the suspension checked, and everything is a-ok.  I test drove a 1998 Dodge Caravan at the same time, and liked the ride much better.

The determining factor in the purchase of a Ford Windstar was the saftey feature.  It was rated the safest of minivans, and I do find that reassuring.  

While this van does have it's flaws--what doesent, anyhow?  I probably would buy it again.
