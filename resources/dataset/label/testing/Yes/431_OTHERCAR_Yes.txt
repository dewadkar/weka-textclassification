            Yeah, the title is pretty broad, but for my mother and for me a few years ago, this was totally true for this car.  If you are under around 5'2 or 5'3, the front seats and the back seats, because of their form and shape, just aren't comfortable at all.  I just turned 16 and have just started to drive the car because it is safer than our other 1998 Avalon (see my other review), and being over 5'5 I love it.

Some people when they go to buy cars, just go by how the car looks and how much power it has.  If you went by this, well, there would be a good chance that you would not end up with this car.  Although it has decent power, it isn't the mos attractive thing that you could buy, but for its purpose it is a fantastic car.  

My sister was just getting ready to go to college, and the old Volvo wagon just wasn't cutting it anymore, and we needed more trunk space.  This car is great for families that like to travel or that have to take things up to colleges with their children.  When the seats fold down on the back seat (either on the passenger side, drivers side, or both) the car can hold just about anything.  Some other families that my sister knew, had to buy extra storage bubbles for the top of the car, but not us.  We were able to go to Lesley College with no problem at all, and the whole family went as well as the luggage.  

There are some other features that this car has that is very nice to have living in New England.  We purchased the top of the line car, with the leather seats, heated seats, and power everything.  This car, has basically got it all.  Living in Connecticut means that there will be days when it will be 95 and humid, as well as -10 and cold as heck.  This car is prepared for all conditions that it may encounter.  The heating and air conditioning in this car is instantaneous as compared to most other cars.  The heated seats are also a very nice feature to use during the winter time, when the heat doesn't kick in as fast as it should be.  And might I tell you folks, I do mean <b>heated</b> seats.  If you leave the heated seats on too long, it hurts, they get that hot.  I highly recommend this car to anyone that has a large family that must bring many things with them when they travel.   <br><br>
