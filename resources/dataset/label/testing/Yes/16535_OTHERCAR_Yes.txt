            In late 1996 I traded in my Blazer and moved to the economical side of the auto world - the VW Jetta GL!

All these years and miles (131,267 to be exact) later the Jetta is still zipping everywhere I go. I live 8 minutes outside of NYC and my Jetta drives in there approx. 4 times a week. I've never had a car handle as well in traffic, fit through tight spots and deal with the hectic style of driving in NYC as my Jetta. I've taken my Jetta to every state on the east coast and some in the central states. It's made the 4 hour drive to Boston more times than I can count. Nothing can stop my Jetta and I when the moonroof is open and my music is blasting. 

Another thing that I really like about my Jetta and what's kept me from buying a new shaped Jetta - the amount of interior room! My Jetta has so much room I feel like I can really relax and spread out. When I recently looked at the new Jetta I felt cramped in comparison. If I understand correctly, the new Jettas have less interior space and less trunk space!

Everyone that sits in my Jetta loves the room and the way the cars drives. For an economical car... it ROCKS!

Enjoy life...drive a VW!
