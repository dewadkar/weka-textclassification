            I have recently purchased my third Camry. I leased a '95, purchased a '97 and now have bought a 2000 model. Obviously, I'm a big fan. In most cars and SUVs, there are things to like and dislike. I've owned several of both, foreign and domestic (because I'm old). I find that with the Camry, I have no dislikes. 

I purchased the LE model with the V6 engine. My previous Camrys each had 4 cylinders and while the performance was reasonable, the V6, with 194 horsepower, accelerates really quickly, making it even easier to merge and pass etc. 

The seating is comfortable, the controls are clear and easy to reach and the ride is smooth and exceptionally quiet. I found, with my earlier Camrys at least, that Toyota makes a reliable automobile. 

There is an extensive list of standard features on the LE V6. These include A/C, 4-wheel ABS brakes, 15&quot; all-season tires, front drive and am/fm ETR Stereo with Cassette and CD.

I think it may cost a bit more to purchase than other comparable models like the Accord and, to be honest, I didn't test drive anything else so I cannot compare in that respect. I did do some comparisons on edmunds.com and found that for the most part the Toyota was usually favorable versus other cars in its class in power, comfort, resale value and reliability. 

The standard warranty is 3 years or 36,000 miles. 

The list price of my Camry was over $25K and I paid $22,500 so you can get discounts (probably better than I got), maybe more so now that the 2001 models are coming soon.

I am very pleased to own this car. 

Thank you for reading.<br><br>
