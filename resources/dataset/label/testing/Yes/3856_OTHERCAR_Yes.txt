                The 1998 Mercury Tracer is a well built car.  I have owned one for about two years and I drive the hell out of it.  The car has never been taken to the shop for repair outside regular maintenance.  The car has held up very well. The only thing Ive ever had to do to it was replace a burned out tail light about six months ago.  The only thing I dont like about it is that it could have more room for the rear passengers.  The seats are very comfortable, even on long trips.  I have taken the car on 700+ mile trips and I was very comfortable the entire trip.  The dash layout and design is very well thought out.  Everything is where you would expect it to be.  The car handles like a more expensive, sportier car.  The engine is a 2.0 liter inline four cylinder.  It produces 110 horsepower and 125 ppf of torque.  Even though this does not seem like much it feels like a whole lot more.  I bought this car because it was inexpensive and it gets great gas mileage, but I got much more than I expected for what I paid.  It has a great powertrain and it drives very smooth.  This car would be great for just about anybody unless they needed a lot of room in the back or they liked to go to the dragstrip.  Overall it is the best car I have ever owned.<br><br>
