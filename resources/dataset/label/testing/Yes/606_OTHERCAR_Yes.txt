            I recently finished a lease on a 1996 Nissan Sentra GXE, and was very pleased with it.  I am not easy on automobiles, and this one withstood my abuse admirably! Throughout the 3 years (and 50,000) miles I put on it, the car only had one engine problem, due to an incorrectly installed alternator belt, which Nissan promptly fixed, free of charge.  The only thing negative I would have to say about the car itself was that the gear shift wasn't all that sturdy: the plastic that showed the gears cracked and broke, and the thumb depressor that you use to switch gears fell out. All in all, though, the car was sturdy and dependable!<br><br>
