            The CL is Acura's first U.S.-built automobile.  It was introduced as a sports coupe with "the sportiness of an Integra, and the refinement of a TL" in 1997.  The original CL was based on the Accord at the time, but since 2001, has been switched to a shortened Acura TL platform.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: Although the sporty 2001 design looks similar, there are subtle appearance changes for 2003.  These include newly-designed wheels, revised headlamps and taillights, body-color (instead of chrome) grille surround and door handles.  The 16-inch wheels look way too small for a car like this.  Even the with the Type-S and its lower-profile tires, the wheels still look a bit smallish mainly because the wheelwells are big.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: There is very little wind noise throughout the cabin even at high speeds.  The performance tires mounted on the 17-inch wheels on the Type-S are noticeably louder than the base model which has 16-inch wheels.  The engine is abnormally silent for such a quick car, even at redline.  The car can be very deceptive when indicating speed if you are like me and rely mostly on engine and wind noise to tell velocity.  The interior is well-designed, sporty, and posh- all at the same time.  The Type-S has a TON of standard features for the dollar.  Automatic climate control, power windows and door locks, leather upholstery, power-adjustable heated front seats, remote keyless entry, and a Bose AM/FM stereo system with cassette and in-dash 6-disc CD changer are all standard issue.  However, I am shocked to report that a car of this caliber only comes with a steering wheel that tilts only.  It should have a telescoping feature as well.   The front seats are well-shaped, but I do not feel like I have enough headroom being a rather tall driver.  Although rear-seat room is leg room is better than in most other coupes, it is still very confining especially for long-legged people.  Cargo room is good for a coupe, but the narrow rear-seat pass-through is not as useful as rear seats that fold completely.

<b>ENGINE</b>: The base CL is powered by a 3.2-liter OHC V6.  It produces 225 horsepower at 5,600 rpm, and 216 lb./ft. of torque at 4,700 rpm and is mated to a standard 5-speed automatic.  This engine should have more than enough power to get the 3,470-pound coupe moving.  Low and mid range torque looks good (on paper) even though the maximum torque is reached at a rather high rpm.  

My test model is the Type-S.  It is also powered by a 3.2-liter OHC V-6 engine, but is tuned to make 260 horsepower at 6,100 rpm, and 232 lb./ft. of torque from 3,500 to 5,500 rpm.  This model with the standard 6-speed manual weighs 3,446 pounds.  This kind of power makes the Type-S a little tricky to get off the line due to torque steer.  The 6-speed's short-throw shifter feel is great, but the gates feel a little to narrow.  The automatic transmission is smooth and downshifts quickly for passing.  Although the CL is far from slow even with the base engine, I feel the Type-S is a better overall performance deal, and is worth the extra $2,200.  I averaged 22.9 mpg, impressive for such a quick, yet rather heavy coupe.

<b>HANDLING</b>: The base CL should be fairly agile for its size.  It is too heavy to truly be able to out-handle a BMW 330Ci, but for a front-heavy front-drive car, I anticipate an excellent handler in most situations.  The Type-S model does a better job suppressing the dive, but I feel it could benefit from stiffer shocks and springs for even tighter handling and less lean.  With the base car's 16-inch wheels and with the Type-S with the automatic transmission, understeer in hard cornering is a problem.  With the 6-speed, a limited-slip differential becomes standard and it handles MUCH more neutrally.

<b>RIDE</b>: The base CL rides pretty comfortably for a car with such sporty intentions, but the trade-off is in the handling department.  The Type-S has a stiffer sport suspension, and thus makes the ride a bit jittery, though much more comfortable than most other luxury sport coupes.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Honda's are very reliable cars.  It seems to me that the Japanese automaker has spared no expense when it comes to making their luxury marque as reliable as possible.

<b>VALUE</b>: The CL is a swift touring coupe that should appeal to those who want the luxury of an Acura TL, but the sportiness and style of an RSX.  Overall I feel the Type-S is worth the extra money over the base CL.  For the real enthusiast, a 6-speed manual transmission is finally available as standard equipment.  For those who want the extra power of the Type-S, but are not necessarily interested in shifting for themselves, the 5-speed automatic is available as a no-cost option.
