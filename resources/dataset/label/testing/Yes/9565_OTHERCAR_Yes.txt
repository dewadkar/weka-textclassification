            It was time for me to trade in my older model car.  I have had three Celica's before this, and I was watching television one day, and saw the tail end of the Toyota Celica commercial, and was intrigued by this car.  I bought it for the quality that is the Toyota name.  I knew that when I bought this car that it would hold it's value, and be a reliable vehicle.

I loved the styling of the new Toyota Celica.  Everyone who sees this car has to find out what kind of car it is.  It has great curb appeal.  The headlights are eye-catching.  I have a red one.  

Driving this car is like driving a race car.  It has great pickup on the road, and never has any kind of hesitation.  When you hit the gas, you move.

I would recommend this car. It is not a car for an older person because it can be a little hard to get in and out of.  Younger drivers would love to have this vehicle. <br><br>
