               I have a 1993 300ZX 2+2 that I purchased last December from my brother.  Overall, the car is great!  First and foremost, this car is not a speed demon�nor is it slow.  The 2+2 is one of the heaviest models (the convertible could be heavier, I don�t know).  I left it stock and plan to keep it that way just in case I want to sell it at a later date.  A few of the many reasons I acquire this car from my brother was its incredible physical present (it just looks like a sports car, even when its not moving), the attention it attracts, and of course, price.  Heck, a used 1993 300ZX (in fair condition) goes for a little over $9,500. With a few thousand in repairs and restoring, you�ll have a fantastic looking sports car for the same price as a relatively new Honda Civic.  
   In comparison to other sports cars I�ve driven, the handling, everyday comfort, drivability, and �prestige� of the 300ZXs (z32 models) are a cut above the rest.  I�ve driven (and test driven) many different makes and models of vehicles: Toyota Supra, Mazda RX-7, Mustang, Corvette, and Z28s just to name a few.  I found both the Toyota and Mazda were excellent cars, but they didn�t have the heritage or the �eye-catching looks� as the Z car.  I love speed and low-end torque and the American Sports cars delivered in that category, but they didn�t have the refinement as with the other foreign cars (and that�s coming from a guy who use to own 2 Fords).  
   Maintenance on this car is not cheap.  I�ve already put over $1,000 in this car, and I see my wallet diminishing in size in the future.  Unless you are a mechanic, these cars do cost quite a bit of money to maintain.  On the brighter side, the insurance cost (especially on non-turbos) is not expensive.  Compared to other cars (not even sports cars, but SUV�s and sedans) it reasonably priced.  
   In ending, I recommend this car with the highest regards.  I recommend this car to mid-20�s and 30-year-old people (both men and women).  Being fortunate to purchase this car in my early 20�s is been a blessing.  I only hope, if you have the money, to wait for the 2003 (coming in 2002) 300ZX.  You�ll be the envy of many Nissan Z owners (including myself).  �Enjoy the Ride�
