            i've had my saturn for three years this week, and i have (almost) nothing but good things to say about it. prior to it being my saturn, my mom drove it for about a year and loved it.

<b>the good:</b>
* great gas mileage (with 90-92 octane gas, mileage is about 36-38 mpg/highway and 25-28 mpg/city)
* responsive
* fun to drive
* great company (very into customer satisfaction - will answer almost any question you have)
* comfortable on long trips

<b>the in-between:</b>
* sensitive 'check engine soon' light
* automatic (but manual is standard)
* only a v4 engine (but it has no problems getting up and going for merging purposes)

<b>the bad:</b>
* cruise control is sporadic

in the four and a half years that my family has owned the car, (above and beyond normal wear and tear) we've had to replace the alternator (once - right after we got it), the battery (once - after not being driven for about four months), and the egr valve (got stuck) -- which is overall fairly low maintenance and by and large only mid-range as far as pricing goes. 

i've driven my saturn all over the country (including a cross country trip or two), and it's much more comfy than other cars i've driven or been in for long distances - especially greyhound. ;)  for the price of the basic model (which is what i have - not including my after-the-fact-cruise control and my more recent purchase of an alpine sound system), you get much, much more than other price-bracket cars. it is definitely a car for someone who needs high mileage or a relatively inexpensive car. my next car will more than likely be a saturn.<br><br>
