            My husband and I purchased our 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager in April of 1998.  We already had 2 children and planned on having another one at some point in the near future and we knew that we'd need the extra room that a mini-van would provide.

At first, I was dead set against buying a &quot;mommy van.&quot;  I vowed that I'd never buy one and drive around in something that resembled a small school bus.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when we went to look at mini vans and test drove this one.  While I had to get used to feeling so &quot;high up&quot; because I had been previously driving a Honda Civic, I was pleased that the minivan rode and handled like a car.  I did not feel like I was trying to maneuver a large truck.

We settled on a dark green loaded SE model.  We have the electronic unit at the top of the windshield that gives us compass direction, gas mileage, miles travelled, and lets us know how many more miles we have to go before we need to fill the tank.  We have the biggest v-6 engine that Plymouth offered and I highly recommend it.  The van is great on the highway, great going up hill, and is not sluggish with cargo in the back.  However, the gas mileage is not that great.  Maybe 20 mpg on average, both city and highway driving.  Our van has cruise control, power windows, and power door locks.  The door locks have a nice safety feature:  they automatically lock on every door when the car is accelerated to over 15 mph.  We have Captain's seats in the middle row so that the boys had their own seat and this minimized the &quot;Mom, he touched me!&quot; comments on long car trips.  The car comfortably seats 7, but we have often taken out the back bench seat (this was prior to the birth of the third child!) to make more cargo room.  If you are going to go for a minivan, I highly recommend the extended cab version like the Grand Voyager.  If you need all the seats in at all times, you will be left with barely enough room for a load of groceries if you don't go for the Grand version.  Our van has an optional grocery bag holder installed on the back of the bench seat to minimize your grocery bags from rolling around in the trunk. There are multiple cup holders all around the van in sizes to fit Mommy's large French Vanilla coffee and Ryan's juice box.  We have dual airbags for safety and all of our car seats and booster seats have installed without difficulty.  

It is just recently off warranty and I hope that our decision to not get the extended warranty doesn't come back to haunt us.  So far, the radio had to be replaced under warranty and I had problems with a belt that would slip during rain storms if I went over a large puddle, but the dealer replaced that and I've had no further problems.

No, it doesn't have any sex appeal.  It is a &quot;mommy van,&quot; but that is what I desperately need with 3 sons and all their equipment.  I did need to have one consolation prize though now that I was in the mini van market and not the Miata market, so I installed a 10 disc CD changer.  It is under the front passenger seat and I have it loaded with 10 cool discs. The control is on the dashboard and it also comes with a remote control so that the back seat passengers can change the discs. (Important note:  You may want to hide this feature from the teenagers!)  So I may be rolling down the street with my 3 kids in a minivan, but hey, I've got some cool tunes along for the ride!   

I highly recommend a minivan for large families and the 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager is a good choice.<br><br>
