            I have driven Large SUVs for the past 10 years. This year I leased a Subaru Forester. This is a car that works. All the buttons,button.All the knobs turn.The auto arrived with no defects.The engine is responsive and you can get up to highway speed easily.I tried the Honda CRV and the Toyota Rav-4.They were nice cars but their engines lacked umph and they needed to be floored to get up to highway speed.The Rav was too small. The Honda was a great car with a puny engine.The Forester handles like a sedan with none of the body lean you get with taller SUVs.On wet pavement the car exudes a feeling of control and security with its' all wheel drive system.There is room (comfortably) for 4 adults. Storage space is less than in an Explorer but surprisingly not that much less.I like this car but all is not perfect in Forester land.The breaks could stop a bit shorter but this may be due to the all weather tires that are supplied with the car.The ergonomics could be improved a bit . The gages are hard to see in the daylight.The switches and buttons  for cruise control and fog lights(to the left and down from the steering wheel)are hard to see and find when driving. Trying to switch to cruise control while at highway speed is far too exciting. Subaru used to have the interior designer from hell designing the interior of their cars .Thankfully he or she is gone. These cars are rather bland. One neither is repulsed or attracted by this cars styling.The Forester is the suv for 95% of us who drive them. <br><br>
