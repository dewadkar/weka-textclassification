            I traded in my Aerostar for a Windstar this summer. I loved my Aerostar it had over a 130,000 miles but the front end finally gave up. My Windstar is a 1998 and had been a leased vehicle. They had to replace the brakes which is a downside of Windstar's because they have aluminium brake rotors. After the brakes were fixed the van drives wonderful. It is not as large as the Aerostar but it is not as top heavy as the Aerostar so it handles well in curves. It has good gas mileage both in city and highway. I like the keyless entry as it makes getting in the car at night safer. The Windstar has been cited as one of the safest minivans on the market which is one of the factors that influenced our decision. Another factor in our decision is the dealership which has been good taking care of any problems we have experienced. When purchasing a vehicle the dealership should be part of the decision,with all of the new technology built into vehicles the dealership should have a good team to keep your vehicle running well. I would recommend the Ford Windstar for anyone that requires a minivan. It has good storage room and with the extra rack on the top it carry's the load on top without handling problems. We traveled to South Dakota with a storage carrier on top without loss of gas mileage. We have experience only a few minor problems that were easily fixed.<br><br>
