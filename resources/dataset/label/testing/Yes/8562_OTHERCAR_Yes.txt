            This car was first bought by my brother who took me with him to shop for.  Having an inclination that one day I would be driving it (I bought it off him after two years), I choose the color and picked some of the accessories for him.  I fell in love with it since day one.  

Mechanics:
The one thing about this car that makes all Japanese cars in its price range a joke is it engine.  A V6 3.1 175 hp engine can make this car a good challenge for most expensive cars on the road.  Since the car is pretty small, the engine does not have to be pushed to accelerate it.  I have had no problems yet with the engine and it still runs smooth and strong. The transmission is also a good feature and has given me no problems at all. 

Exterior:
The car is very appealing from the outside if it was maintained for.  The color I have is one of the rare Medium Adriatic Blue.  The paint quality is good, perhaps not as good as a Lexus but that's a $40k+ car, not $17k.  The only bad thing about the exterior were the wheels.  The paint was coming off and the dealer ended up repainting them under the warranty.  

Interior:
Seats are comfortable and low.  Everything is in your hands reach.  The back seats are ok.  The cheap plastic around the screws cracked but its not noticeable.  The audio system as I recall (it was all replaced with aftermarket) was good; not much.   

On the Road:
Performs very very well.  You can tap the gas pedal at a stop and be ahead of everyone easily.  Turning with the car is its second strongest point.  The suspensions are very good that you can make a sharp turn going 20 mph without a problem (make sure you have the tires for it though).  Ride is a little rough on bumpy roads but expected from a sporty car.

As of November, the car is passed down once more to my girlfriend and she is crazy about it.  I maintained the paint with a monthly wax and polish and the car still looks good as new.  She has yet to have a problem with it and at 65k, I don't see any coming for a long time.
