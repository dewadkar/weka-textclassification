            I was a skeptic when HP came out with their line of cameras, but since I work in electronic retail I got a chance to play with it (and all other cameras) before choosing to buy it. Here's my list of reasons why I purchased it over other cameras:

- 5.3 megapixel
- 21x total zoom
- Automatic controls
- Video recording up to 90 seconds
- Consecutive shooting
- Pentax Lens
- Price was lower compared to most other 5.0 megapixel cameras

To me, these were a lot of features for the price. Better zoom than most, if I need to get in close on a subject (of course optical is better than digital, but you will be spending quite a bit more for a camera with a higher optical zoom. Best suited for "professional" photographers). I can take video for longer bursts compared to most cameras (which are 15-30 seconds). I have the options for manual controls. On top of that, it has automatic settings, easy to use and navigate (simple layout, not too many buttons to confuse people, menu system is self-explanatory and easy), great color accuracy (though sometimes it's slightly muted) and can record audio clips for pictures. You can change the camera setting to "removeable drive" so you can put the pictures back on the camera.

Of course there are always cons, but only a few consistent ones. It does have a shutter delay, but all cameras do (prime the focus to get around it. Works with all cameras). It's a little slow to save pictures, but if you press the shutter within 1 sec of the last picture, you'll take another (the consecutive shooting feature). Keep in mind that this is a 5mp camera so larger files will take a little more time to save. It has only a few auto-modes, the macro shooting doesn't work well, the flash is excellent up to about 10ft only, and your choice of file size is either 5 or 1 megapixel (but the 1 megapixel pictures are quite good too). It's true that this camera loves batteries, but I can fill up 128mb card with 5mp pictures and video on one pair of rechargeable (anything else will get drained VERY FAST) AA and still have some juice left. People who use the LCD screen like a CRUTCH will have less battery power. LCD screens in general don't show well when used outdoors. I don't understand people who try to use it when it won't work well at all, or who even complain about it (and not just on cameras). Slow startup time? I'm not picky about the difference between 2 and 5 seconds. Bad video? It's a CAMERA, not a camcorder.

Reviews that complain about the printing, connectivity, card-errors, software, etc. either got a lemon, didn't do something, have pc issues (I have lots of customers with pc issues on a weekly basis) which can interfere, or had expectations past what the camera can do. Otherwise HP's software for their products is the best for ease of use and compatibility. If you're looking for a "professional" camera, this may not be it and you might want to spend a little more in a different brand. But for most people who aren't "professional" photographers, then this is a spectacular buy. If I had to choose a different camera instead of this HP, it would probably be either a Canon or a Sony, since they have some great cameras. Probably a Canon though, since I like the manual controls and since I don't prefer the shape of most Sony DSCP cameras.
