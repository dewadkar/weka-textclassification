                 I bought a 2002 Nissan Xterra, and I am just thrilled. After 8 years in a Toyota Corolla that I bought used and which I was very thankful for and loved for many sensible reasons (like gas mileage and 4 doors and a good A/C), it&#146s nice to have something more fun and with more room.

     After a lot of thought, I decided I did need and want a SUV. I would not buy one just for &#147looks.&#148 They do take up more space and use more gas, and I&#146m not one to waste our resources. My mom inherited family land back in a mountain holler with the drive in on a ledge of a mountain with a dirt road or through the cornfield and crossing the creek. My dad has the only 4-wheel drive in the family, and that&#146s a pick-up, which won&#146t carry but 2 people in comfortably or legally. If my boys are going to enjoy the mountains and the creek and get back to the trailer around the mountain, then we need to have a 4-wheel drive. I also want a boat, and that would take something with some pull&#151a 6 cylinder for sure. My dad got a 4-cylinder camper and pulls a boat, and he has bought more transmissions than I can remember&#151mostly out of state and expensive.

     When I decided on a SUV with 4x4 and 6 cylinders, I just started to look around on the road to see if I saw one that looked really good. Though I will be reasonable on what to buy and how much to pay (and was happy with a Corolla and wish it a good family now), I do want a vehicle I feel good about stepping out of. During high school, I drove the ugliest green Catalina Pontiac that ever graced the face of the earth, and I tried to park as far away as possible and prayed no one knew I drove that really awful looking pea green tank.

    There must only be one Xterra in this town, and I saw that one on the way to work. In traffic, I could not see the make or model, but I knew that one looked really wonderful. With the racks on top and the shape, it just says that it is a neat thing to drive. Many of the SUVs look basically the same, but I know an Xterra when I see one now. I knew that look from the day I saw it on the road.

     Since I am big on researching and shopping online, I went to many car sites and looked at SUVs. It didn&#146t take long to find the Nissan Xterra, since it does have a unique look. 

     Of course, I&#146m not buying a vehicle that I know I&#146ll drive a long time without making sure that it&#146s what I want and will be a good drive. I&#146m also one to compare.

    In this case with needing a real 4-wheel drive, the choices I saw as the best on research were the Dodge Durango, Jeep Wrangler or Jeep Liberty, and the Xterra. These are the toughest SUVs and most truck-like which won&#146t work for some people but is good if you do go out in the woods, snow, or sand with the SUV. 

     As I looked these over and read up, here is what I decided:

-The Dodge Durango was more expensive than what I wanted to pay. It was a little bigger and bulkier and looked more guy-like.

-The Jeep Wrangler does not have any storage. It would be fun, but it would not be practical with kids to haul around. I may get one of these when I&#146m old.

-Jeep Liberty is solid and my second choice, but I get a little more room and style with the Xterra.

    Again, I am back to the Xterra and this time for practical reasons. It is built on a truck chassis and one of the few SUVs to use that one-piece hard frame. Though it is a rougher ride than some of the car-like SUVs, it has a solid build and the most pull for the money. 

     The next decision I needed to make was whether to buy an Xterra used or new. Buying a used SUV is a gamble, since many have been ridden rough. There are some great deals with city folks getting them for looks and not using them out in the woods, but it&#146s hard to know that. I looked at some used models, but they ended up being more expensive than buying new anyway, so I decided to go brand new.

     The next thing was to decide whether to go with 2002 or 2003 as the new models are coming on the lots. If that was really close I price, it would make sense to go with the newer model year number. SUVs move well, so they don&#146t offer much off. But, the 2002 have a $750 back from the company, and 2003 do not. The 2003 are more expensive on the basic model too, but that is mostly due to some options now being added as standard. They upgraded on the seats, stereo, and also put the ashtray back in. Do know that 2002 does not have an ashtray, and be sure to ask to have the one for the drink holder ordered if you do need an ashtray and go 2002. I think they thought they had a healthy market and then figured out that wild and not-so-healthy children do buy Xterras too. 

     I went online kind of &#147up in the air.&#148 That doesn&#146t work really well online, since they want to know exactly what you want. I ended up running a red Xterra 2002 to get a price and was surprised at the mark-up even from invoice. My price quote was $1500 under invoice (remembering the $750 from the factory in that). That was from Autobytel, and I have a review on that service which did help for the most part. If you are dealing from sticker, then you are getting taken for a real ride, and even invoice is pretty much a joke.

     One thing about going online is that you don&#146t get to see, feel, or drive the vehicle. I&#146m just a bit strange about that. Do I really want to put out the kind of money it takes to get a vehicle and just have it show up at my house? Adding to that problem, I wanted a red SUV and a real red&#151like fire engine. When I started to read more online, I saw that the red is really burgundy. When I asked more questions, I discovered that the real red was 2000 and earlier and not for 2002 or 2003.

     I decided to go to the dealer in town and see the Xterras, drive one, and talk. The sales guy finds me up under the Xterra looking at the chassis. I want to see what I&#146m riding on. Now, I&#146m not all the way under, but I have a good view. He offers me a test drive, but I tell him that I have to come back with my boys who will be my main passengers. He gives me some brochures and shows me colors in the show room, so I have a better idea about what I want. John Russell at Nissan in Salisbury, NC is one of the best sales guys I've ever met. He never pushed. He just helped out which is how it should be. When I buy my next vehicle, then I'm going right back to talk to him. 

     I don&#146t know who came up with the colors for Xterra, but some are gosh awful. One blue was so bad that they stopped that color on the production line. They have a school bus yellow and a pumpkin orange. I&#146m still wanting red (and can&#146t get that), but I like the green, blue (not the one pulled) and the black. I didn&#146t know I liked the black until I saw it in person. That looked really nice.

     That afternoon I do go back with the boys. One funny thing is that the owner (or maybe manager) said they could drive it (earlier in the day). They are 9 and 12 years, so I had to laugh. He thought I wanted guys to drive it to see when I really wanted little boys to ride it to see. You just never know, and some assumptions are hilarious. He had to laugh too when I told him the ages, and he joked with them about that when they came in. I don&#146t know why guys can&#146t figure out that some girls can and do want a SUV and can drive a stick and don&#146t need any male input, but that&#146s my deal. It&#146s OK if a dealer can adjust, and this one did. One of my students even said maybe I should take my dad, and I can see that. But, it&#146s going to be my SUV, and I&#146m going to decide. If I get a bad vibe, I look somewhere else. If the guys (and most are guys on car lots) can handle it, I&#146m one good person to deal with. I know what I want, what I can pay, and if I say it&#146s a deal, then it is. John Russell (who was my salesperson) never blinked an eye about me being female, and the owner recovered fast from thinking that my boys would drive and decide. 

     Dealers can deal more with cars on the lot rather than ones they have to bring in. I looked at what they had here in town and the school bus yellow and black were 4x4 and the others 4x2. Gas mileage is better on 4x2 but not much. You are going to be doing good to get 20 mpg with an Xterra no matter what. The average is going to be around 16-17 mpg.

     The black one caught my eye from the start. It was a manual (or stick), and that is good for 4 wheeling. You have more control over the pull and the power with the manual transmission. I&#146m good on a shift, so that was not a problem, but that could be for many drivers. I think the estimate is that only 20 percent can drive stick now, so don&#146t buy stick if you want to sell the Xterra back in a couple of years. Anyway, I knew that would be a vehicle I could deal on. They won&#146t find many people who can buy that one, and my being female is a leg up when I can do it and can then talk &#147buy.&#148

     Also note that manual can be easier on gas depending on how your drive. If you are smooth and don&#146t rev up, then you can go up a gallon or two on the mileage. If you grind the gears and punch the motor, then you won&#146t see a difference. Anyway, I knew this would work for me, but don&#146t do it if you have any doubts.

     Automatic transmission runs about $600 on average. If you can go manual, you can deal and get some nice stuff worth more on paper to offset the stick. The options are all added with the dealer mark up, so they don&#146t lose money on the deal (and I don&#146t expect them to). But, they can cut you more slack on the price and look good and make you feel good if you can negotiate on the transmission. 

   That red automatic that I had a price for was the very basic model, but the black manual had the 6 CD, upgrade on the interior material and the super charge on the engine. Though the prices looked higher, I knew they were about the same and bought the black in place of the red online for the same ticket price. They tossed in the tow hitch and the option ashtray with the deal when they asked what it would take and I said those things and the price on the red lower end. 

     Now that I&#146m driving the Xterra, I would say that it is wonderful. 

     If you do go with the standard shift transmission, it is 5 speed and really smooth and easy to drive. Though you have the truck pull, you have the car feel on the shift. I did drive an automatic, and it&#146s fine too. It does have power and will do what you want if you can&#146t do the manual. 

   The ride on the manual is truck-like but not bad, and the automatic is about the same (better if the person is not good on the stick). If you drive luxury, then you will feel like you are being battered a bit. My mom has a smooth ride, and she was OK with this one (though only a short drive). I owned and drove a 68 Mustang (rough ride), 87 Mustang (piece of junk and rattly), and Toyota Corolla (very utilitarian&#151no comforts). I also drove a 10-ton dump truck, so I&#146m fine on the ride. It&#146s much better than most rides I&#146ve owned or handled but it&#146s not smooth like an expensive car.

     Inside, you won&#146t get as much room as you think in the front part. The console wraps around and limits the space for putting things. Actually, I had more room in the Corolla as far as setting my purse in the middle. In the middle of the Xterra, you have compartments that come up high and the dash cushions in around you. These spaces are nice, but I sure hate to throw my purse in the back and then have to try to reach for it with a manual transmission that requires keeping my feet on the pedals.

    If you are about 5 foot 9  and up and can go with the seat moved back, then you have more room. With the seat back, you can put your arm on the middle console and can easily reach the seatbelt over your left shoulder. At 5 foot four (and under) and with the seat moved up tight, my elbow misses the middle console and also the seatbelt is a reach back to grab. The drink holder is awkward with a slight back reach. This is designed for taller people in general, as is the case with every SUV I&#146ve been in. Move the seat back, and you are good and have nice headroom too. Up close, you just get the high top (not needed in my case) and not much space to move around. 

    The tight fit on the front does make it easy to use the CD and radio. The Corolla was a stretch, but I&#146m right on top of the stereo in the Xterra. I do like that, though I hate the trade off on the reach for the other things in the cab part. I have the six CD, and it takes the CDs right in (sucks them in) and no piece of equipment you have to stick in the hole. The console to the right of the driver will hold your CD cases, and you can add an overhead on the generous sun visor. The sound is really nice for factory, and the number varies on the speakers. But, I think the standard is 6, and 8 is the upgrade depending on the package.

     As far as the back, you have good space there. Again, remember that I&#146m not real tall. The space behind my seat (pulled up) is really roomy, and the passenger side in OK with the front seat pushed back for more room in front. The best thing is that the back seat is up high to see out the front. They call that stadium seating, and that is nice. The boys can see out the front, and the big windows to the side mean a good view from the sides too.

    The Xterra has 12-volt plugholes, which can be very handy. The number varies, but you have them front and back and some in the middle. Many companies are making appliances that can plug right in the vehicle. The one I know I will buy is the cooler/heater box that will keep drinks cold or a meal like chicken hot while you drive. You can run 12 volt for a few hours on a good battery with the vehicle shut off and then crank and run the vehicle to recharge. Some of the other things that look neat for 12 volt are the seat cover with heat and a massage, blow dryer, and cooker to make a meal. These are available by looking at Wal-Mart, online with search for 12 volt, and also on the Nissan page with a few items.

     Nissan also has a tent to put on the back with the back lid flipped up. The back seats fold down to make a bed area (or hauling space). Then you put the tent on with the back metal flap as the main part and have space for 2 to sleep. We have a tent and want to camp. It would be the boys, me, and the dad-person. With that tent option, it would mean that we would all have space to go out as a family and no problem about trying to sleep four in a tent. I am thinking I would fare better on camping with more cover like the back end of an Xterra. I don&#146t like to sleep right on the ground.  That tent is kind of expensive (over $100 I think), but it hooks to the tire and such and makes a nice tent and would work for our family.

     Some other options that are nice are the tow hitch, which is on order for my vehicle, bicycle rack, and the tire step. The tire step means that you can step up and push a canoe or such on top or wash the vehicle without going to town. 

     One note I would make on the 4x4 is that you have to go in reverse to put the wheels back to normal. Some of the newer vehicles like my dad&#146s Ford truck do not require that older way of doing it. On the plus side, you can go to 4x4 on the fly, which means that you can be driving and kick in the four wheel rather than stop and then do that. You could just drive around in 4x4 all the time, but that would eat up a lot of gas.

     When I got this vehicle, I did not know it was a really hot item. It is marketed to ages 25 to 35, and it is high priced for that age group. My college students think it is really neat, and my boys are excited to go to school with this SUV. I did think it was cute when first looking and has more creature comforts than the typical truck based SUV, but it is a power horse too, which is what I needed and the reason I went with this one. 

     I do my own &#147thinking,&#148 and I did do a lot of research in selecting the Xterra. I got a great price on a really neat vehicle. It&#146s nice to be cool, even if that is not my bottom line. Even the insurance lady when called about the change said: &#147Oh cool. That is what I want. What color did you get?&#148

    I will update (and I&#146m pretty good about that here at Epinions). After a few hundred miles on this Xterra, I do feel that I made the right pick. There are a few things I would change, but I really doubt any vehicle would be so custom-made that it would be every thing that a person could ever want. My 68 Mustang was my baby, and this one looks to be the same kind of relationship. It&#146s nice when your vehicle is more than just a ride, and I see this one going that way.


UPDATE (as promised)

I've hit 4000K miles now, and I'm still thrilled with the Xterra. I did get the tent, cooler, and also a GameBoy Advance and a DVD that will plug in. Traveling is much better with the extra creature comforts. 

John Russell has followed up several times and is a real joy to work with. The guys in service have been great too. I walked in off the street, and they treated me great then before I bought, and they have continued to be top notch.

The only problem I've had has been with Nissan. They send my bill to my street address (though I've told them this town only delivers to the PO). I've had to call the last 3 months and send the payment in with the number and a note about why I don't use the bill they send (but I don't get). On this third call, I think the guy did get that figured out though, since I have a bill now. That's good. I'm good for the money esp when they send a bill.
