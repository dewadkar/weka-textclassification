Logic and analysis will tell you the Jeep Grand Cherokee is not the SUV to buy. I did all my homework beforehand, reading Consumer Reports, looking through reviews on Usenet, and checking out About.com for good measure. I was simply looking for something with four doors, for under $18,000. I live in the city, so I was looking for something smaller than the gonzo Expedition-sized vehicles, which gobble up three parking spaces and half the sidewalk.

All the data pointed me to something like the Toyota RAV4. They're supposedly well-built, they're small, and they get decent gas mileage. But after driving a couple, they felt...well, dinky. Cheap. The doors seemed too thin.

I wound up with the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4WD/automatic. It's a used one with 44K miles on it. I couldn't be happier (with one exception, which I'll get to later.) It feels safe, it sits high up off the road, the 4WD works like a dream, and the inside is capacious. So far (and I'm crossing my fingers) all the reports I read about mechanical problems haven't proven out with my car. (Though I must inform you that my mom's Grand Cherokee Limited has an air conditioning unit that only works on the 3rd Wednesday of every month.)

The Jeep is a blast to drive -- especially on those dirt roads that make you clench your teeth in any other car. And it looks great when it's just been washed -- you could take it to the Symphony. All around, a really fun, versatile car. Except...

...If you're someone who doesn't enjoy frequent visits to the gas station. I haven't tracked the gas mileage to be able to provide you with good numbers, but what I do know is that I'm refueling more often than with any car I've owned before (and all I've owned have been American-made gas guzzlers.) The only thing that makes me feel better is when I see a Hummer drive by -- I know he's spending even more on fill-ups.

I'm not sure that I would shell out the money to buy one of these puppies when new, but there are a lot of used ones on car lots around the country -- and it seems like it's pretty easy to find a good deal. My advice: look for a recently turned-in lease vehicle.
