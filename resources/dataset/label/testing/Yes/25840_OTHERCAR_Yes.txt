            I purchased my Jeep Cherokee two months ago,and just love it! Not only is it comfortable,but with the optional power sunroof,and multidisc CD player ...very sporty.Have rented (and drove extensively) other SUV'S through my corporate travels,most recently a Ford Expedition,AND this Cherokee matches the far more expensive ones hands down.It rides very smooth ,with a quietness that equals my Oldsmobile 98 Luxury vehicle.It also has great roominess in the cargo area,w/mesh netting to hold &quot;objects&quot;.Being a critical care nurse,I HAVE to be at work,and the 4 -wheel option is very easy to shift into as it is merely a lever on the floor that is much like the automatic shifter.Really have found no flaws yet,and Chrysler/Daimler has been sending many follow-up survey's etc. to monitor my feelings toward this vehicle...a plus to me!Would recommend this vehicle to women,and really anyone who wants a sporty,great looking option to the more expensive foreign SUV'S.    <br><br>
