            One of my girl friends invited me to go to nearest dealership with her.  She is interested in buying a 2000 Kia Sportage.  I had to make arrangements for the supervision of my kids.  Fortunately, my husband came home from work early that afternoon.  He volunteered to spend the time with them while I was gone having some fun test-driving this hot gold 2000 4WD 4 dr Kia Sportage.

As soon as we got there, we were greeted by a young salesman who had started flirting on the phone with my single girlfriend. She made the appointment for 4 P.M. We got there way before time. The salesman approached us and guided to us to the parking area where all the 2000 Kias were parked.  My girl friend picked a silver Kia first.  She parked her Honda around.  Off we went on our trial in an $18565 Kia Sportage!

I wanted to test-drive the five-speed manual transmission because I am used to driving stick shift.  I could not argue with my girl friend about the economy that this SUV would give her.  She opted for the automatic transmission instead.  We felt very secure hitting the surrounding freeways and highways.  For no apparent reasons, she activated the 4WD and 2WD back and forth.  I did not feel any problems.  She was having fun.  I told her that I would be the one to drive back.  She agreed.

Here is what I observed in this 2000 Kia.  There is lots of space, good for 5 passengers.  The Kia has a tilt steering wheel and bold, easy-to-read instrument panel gauges and controls.  I teased my friend about the cupholders.  She is addicted to coke.  She won't any spillage accidents.  All sizes of cups can adjust and fit into these holders.  I also observed that the Kia has AM/FM/CD audio system.  Now, you may expect a little increase for these amenities.  It is truly a cool car.  When It was my time to test this car, I noticed that I had a footrest and a sliding armrest. The seats are made of a heavy duty type of material.  This is good for kids who want to play with their toys in the back.  If your puppy is part of the passenger load, you won't have to worry about tearing.

When we got back to the dealership, we parked it and got out to inspect the exterior.  We put the headlights on and noticed that they are the expensive-looking clear lens style and clear lens-tailights that Kia comes with.  &quot;Wow,&quot; we exclaimed.

My friend is truly hooked on this Kia.  She likes the color.  I tried to persuade her to get the gold one.  She prefers the Silver.  She is still working on the financial part now.  She will trade her Honda Accord which has so many miles.

Great car.
