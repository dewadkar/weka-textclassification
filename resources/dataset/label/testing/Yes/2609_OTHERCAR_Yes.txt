            My husband and I bought our Maxima in June of 2000.  During the 17 months we have owed it, we have put 35,000 miles on the car.  That's not because we are required to travel with our job, we just love to drive it!  We have been happy with nearly everything about this car.

We have had some problems with the rear brakes.  After 33,000 miles they had to be replaced.  This is way ahead of schedule, considering the front brakes are the originals.  Other than that, though, it has been perfect. 

I have had Nissans in the past.  I find them to be extremely reliable and require low maintenance. This car (aside from the brakes) is proving to be more of the same.

We have a Maxima SE.  The four-door sports car IS a reality - it is the Nissan Maxima.  The car performs beyond expectations.  It has excellent pick up whenever you ask for it.  The seats are comfortable throughout a long trip.  The look is &quot;Ahhhhh.&quot;

Between the sporty look and the great performance, you get a lot of bang for your buck out of the 1999 Maxima!<br><br>
