            I recently purchased this camera; it is unbelievable.  Prior to this camera I had a Nikon coolpix 775.  The Nikon was nice with the 2.1-mega pixels but it can�t compare to the d-40�s 4 mega pixels.  The image quality is extremely sharp and precise.  The camera is relatively small; however, it is slightly too large in thickness which makes it difficult to put into pockets unless you have baggy or cargo pants.  The zoom is not outstanding, but that is what you sacrifice for size (3x optical).  The camera comes with a 16mb smart media card, which is a joke.  I immediately purchased a 128mb card, which is sufficient (for now) in my opinion.  The camera may be small, but it also packs a lot of neat features including QuickTime video capability with sound (the Nikons don�t have sound).  Another nice thing is the ability to have shortcuts in the menus, which makes it easier to features that you commonly use.  There are two things that I would change if I were Olympus.  First, I would include rechargeable batteries with the camera instead of the ones that they provide.  I had to buy four 1600 mAh Ni-MH batteries for $40 including the charger.  Secondly, I don�t now why they didn�t include a carrying case.  I have been shopping around for a carrying case that fits the camera but the only ones that I have found that fit are really tacky looking.  I think I will end up buying the one Olympus made for the d-40 specifically.  It is $40 but at least it is made of leather and looks nice.  This is the best camera on the market right now in my opinion.  My friend bought a Sony digital camera that was also 4 mega pixels; however, it is huge.  There should be no reason to have such a large camera unless it is a SRL.  I bought the camera at a local Costco (price club) which saved me about $50 compared to buying it at an electronics store for $700
