            I bough a used 199 M3 [upgraded with a REMUS exhaust and a K&amp;N low restriction filter] for more than I have ever paid for a car before.  True. I am a BMW fanatic, having owned a Bavaria for 17 years and a 1992 325i for 1.5 years [only surrendering it when I moved to the USA -- the 1992 version is not DOT-compliant].

I had always thought the M3 to be a sort of badge-engineering -- what, after all, could they add to the base package which could justify the extra cost?  Until I tried this one -- every time I drive it, I experience a burst of pleasure which is unrivalled by any other car I have ever driven.  So, after all, what is so good?:
* As Captain Queeg would have said -- I want power, goddam power, and I want it RIGHT NOW! -- and that is what the M3 supplies -- in any gear, if you need more, just press the loud pedal, and you are greeted by this most incredible sound [a gutteral obbligato throb in the lower revs, and a silk-tearing scream at the limit] and a major push in the back.
* It makes any twisty road straight -- I read on the Web the ultimate tribute which I believe to be true: the way to improve your M3 handling is by becoming a better driver -- as delivered it has all the handling needed to drive any road you may encounter.
* It stops, dead, when you press the brake.

When I first tried a 32i, it was not the fastest, the car with the best road feel, the quickest, the best-handling, or the best-braking of those marques I tried [a 1993 MX-7 was the fastest and the best handling, an EAGLE Talon was the quickest, a 1995 Acura Integra GS-R had the best road feel, and a 1995 Volkswagen GT-1 had the best brakes].  When I mentioned this to a fellow car aficianado, who was also a Harley fan, he replied with the standard riposte -- If you have to ask, I cannot explain.

In a nutshell, this car never lets me down.  Whenever I drive it, I feel like God.<br><br>
