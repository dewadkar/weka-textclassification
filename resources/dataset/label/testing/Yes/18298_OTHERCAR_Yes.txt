            Want to buy a 2000 (1/2, 3/4 or one ton) Dodge ram Extended Cab Diesel pick-up to plow snow with? Sorry, they won't build one for you. I bought a 1997 Dodge ram 2500 diesel truck with a &quot;V&quot; snow plow. I love it. It plows snow like there is no tomorrow. I have the 8' box on the Dodge I own now and wanted to buy a 2000, extended cab, quad, with a 6' box. That's the same frame, as I have now. I also use my pick-up to tow my 5th wheel RV, in the summer, and wanted more room in the cab. Dodge told me that they would not build me one because the front end could not handle the weight of the diesel motor, and the plow together. HUH??? I asked them if they still used Dana 60's in the front end. (The same axle, lots of people use in mud drags, that go bouncing up and down the mud track with 2000 pounds of extra weight strapped on the front end of them) They said they still use that very same Dana 60's.
You can buy a diesel truck from them and put a plow on after you buy it, but it will void the warranty. Yeah, like someone will pay $30,000+ for a truck and lose the warranty. The only way you can buy a new Dodge Ram for snow plowing is if you get the 318 cu. in. gas engine. Sorry, way to much gas guzzling and not enough motor to do the job year after year. To put it bluntly, Dodge will not sell you a good working snow plow truck. They did in the past, but those days are over. I think you can thank the lawyers for this one. Dodge makes a good truck to ride around in and pull RV's and stuff, but if you want a good WORK truck that will work for 500,000+ miles Dodge no longer makes them.<br><br>
