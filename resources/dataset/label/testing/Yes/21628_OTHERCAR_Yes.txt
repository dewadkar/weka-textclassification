            We've had our 94 Grand Cherokee since 10/94 when we purchased it with 7000 miles on it.  We have had VERY little go wrong mechanically with this vehicle, and it still looks great and rides very well.  We now have 95,000 miles on it, and are comfortable that we'll still be driving it at 150,000 with little or no trouble.

We really like all the little "extras" they put into this model - with a touch of a button, you know the outside temp, what direction you're going, how many miles you can go on your tank of gas, what your current MPG is, and how many miles and hours you've driven on your present tank.  It also has a great vehicle information center that tells you if you have a door ajar, if your turn signal is left on for more than 5 minutes, as well as if your coolant or windshield wiper fluid is too low.  We feel the seats are very comfortable, and would strongly consider purchasing another jeep when the time comes to replace this one.
