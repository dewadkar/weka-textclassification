            Hello again, here I am with another aquisition, I have been looking for one of these Digicams for about a year now, no one around me had them til about a month ago.
  When I started looking, the cam was supposed to be around 150.00 I think... I went into Wal-Mart the other day after work, just to kill time, when I saw this cam right by the electronics dept, I grabbed one, and started to read the package, and ended up buying it to try it.
  I loved what I was reading,or should I say, what they claimed the cam could do, it does just about everything they claimed, except, this is not a Megapixel Digicam.. it interpolates the 640x480 image (stretches it) so it becomes a megapixel sized image(and looks blurry too) (another cam I had did this. the D-Link DSC 350 I believe)

  Well, I have had the cam about a week and a half (I returned the first one, because it seemd to be a bit off, so I thought I'd try another, this one works great), and have taken quite a few pics with it, some good, some bad, since I am still learning this cam, that's not a problem.
  What I liked about this Digicam was the following, the 3x optical zoom, most cams in this price range ($60.00) don't have any zoom, let alone optical zoom, it works well, it is a bit loud when running, but I can live with that.
  I also love the little microscreen in the viewfinder, when you set up the pic, you are looking through the lens, just like on a 35mm SLR camera, then you take the pic, and the image goes black, then the microscreen comes on and shows you a quickview of the pic you shot, for a few seconds, then it goes back to the normal thru the lens image, one thing, don't move the cam while the image is blank or black, it's still capturing the image.
  it says it has auto focus, I dunno about if it does or not, but it seems to be a good lens system, again, most digicams in this range don't have autofocus either, so I can handle that.
  Now for some flaws.. first, the battery, it uses a 123 lithium cell (around 6 bucks) which can be a pain if the store you are near doesn't have them.. some complain about the price, but you pay that much for batteries for most digicams (almost)
  Another flaw is the position of the lens, I can't help but accidently touch the lens, making a fingerprint on the red colored lens filter, take practice to keep your fingers away.
  Someone commented on the position of the controls, I couldn't agree more, all seem to be right where they need to be.
  The images transfer through USB to the computer, I have even printed pics I took (3x5 or 4x6) they came out fine, not great, but fine (wallet sized pics work good *smiles*)
  This cam is SMALL even with the case it fits in my pocket well, I always have it with me for a few quick pics
 
 Well, that's all for now, I'll add to this later (getting sleepy), hope you enjoyed reading this, and if you  have any comments (or critisicisims (constructive I hope *smiles*)) feel free to reply

 Thank you for reading
