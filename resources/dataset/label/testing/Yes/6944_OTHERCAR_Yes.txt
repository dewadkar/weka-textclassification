            My parents leased a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer last year.They love this car.This is the second blazer they have leased.I asked them one day,why do you like this car so much?Both of them answered me and said,&quot; The ride is smoother,plenty of room for road trip's,and easier to get in and out of the blazer.&quot;He also say's,&quot;he like's it because it is an easier way to pick up what you can't normally pick up in a regular size car.So,if you are looking for a car that is a smoother ride,roomy or you just have trouble getting out of a car,I suggest that you look at the Chevrolet Blazer at your local Chevrolet Dealer.<br><br>
