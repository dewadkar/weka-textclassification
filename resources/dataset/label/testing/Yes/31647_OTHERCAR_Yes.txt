            So that last olds I drove was my friends '87 88, and I just looked at it as another big American car.  Drove alright, looked like a T-Bird, doors way too big, and so on.

My dad bought this baby from an Olds dealer about two years ago and my God, I have never been so impressed by a car.  Right up front, you read about reliability problems with this car, and it has gone into the shop occasionally under warranty, but mostly for pretty minor stuff.  The one thing I would complain about is some of the little stuff is fragile, for example, there is a cup holder that pops out between the front seats, and it won't stay in anymore.  Such are minor complaints.

On the positive side, tape and cd player in the car, leather, wondefully adjustable seats, really spacious, two cigarette lighters so you can still light smokes when your phone is plugged in (or whatever).  The cruise controls and some stereo controls are on the steering wheel, which is really handy.  There's also a 'turbo' button on the gear shift, and whatever it does, it works.  My dad shifts that sucker and and passes everybody.  As an ex race car driver, he gets a kick out of a huge engine, and the temptation is often too much for him to take.

I haven't really any complaints about the car other than what has been listed above, gas mileage is good, a/c is controlled on both driver and passenger sides, which is nice, and the stereo is great.  I really enjoy the car, and were I to have the cash, I'd get myself one.  So that means I'll be driving it when it's old enough to be an antique.

On a side note, if you want one, get one soon, as they have stopped making oldsmobiles to push cadillacs more, which is disappointing.

Thanks for reading my review.
