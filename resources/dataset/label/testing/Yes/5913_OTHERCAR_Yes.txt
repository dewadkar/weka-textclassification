            My wife and I own a 1996 Isuzu Rodeo. V6, 5-speed, air,cruise, power windows and locks. This has been one of the best if not the best vehicle I've ever owned from a reliability and drive-ability standpoint.

I've owned a Toyota Celica, Dodge Challenger(made by Mitsubishi), Dodge Shadow(possibly the worst vehicle I've ever owned). All of these from new. The Rodeo has by far surpassed all of these in reliability. It currently has over 60,000 miles on it and has been driven from Maryland to Florida as well as a trip from Maryland to Corpus Christi Texas two years ago.  On both of these trips, we were travelling in the heat and had to run the air conditioning virtually the entire time.  I'd say that while we were driving, we averaged somewhere around 68mph. On both of these trips, we averaged over 24mpg.  

Around town, if run reasonably(in other words not jumping on the gas hard when starting out), my wife averages right around 20mpg.  All this with V6 power and four-wheel drive availability.

I think if I had anything bad to say about the Rodeo at all, it would be its seemingly uneasy feeling in four-wheel drive. However, that could be as much due to the fact that we have to use it so infrequently, that neither my wife or I are that used to driving it in four-wheel drive.

The only other downside to owning this Rodeo is that we live in a rural area, meaning that we have to drive a little over an hour to get to a dealer. The good side of that is that it's been so reliable and so problem free, that we haven't had to make that drive very often. Initially, I used to take it to the dealer for oil-changes, but now just do those myself.

In the 60k miles, it's only had regular maintenance. Basically meaning oil changes and I did have to replace the rear brakes. Oh, one other thing.. the resistor in the fan motor went bad and had to replace that so my wife would have heat! That is it. No tune-ups, no other parts replaced.
