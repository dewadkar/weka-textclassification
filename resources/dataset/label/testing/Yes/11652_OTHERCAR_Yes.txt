            We purchased our 530i about over one year ago from a used car dealer. The 530, as you may know, is V-8 powered with a slightly larger V-8 in the 5 series available, the 540i. BMW also made two six cylinder models, the 525 and 528.

Our car showed 82,000 miles on the odometer, which I verified via Carfax. Purchased mainly for long trips, it now has 94,000 miles logged. 

This is the first BMW we have owned and we are very happy with it. To date, we have not needed a single repair. Oil changes are a breeze, although you do need a special socket to remove the oil filter canister. This vehicle does require more specialized critical periodic maintenance. For instance, fluid in the cooling system and brakes calls for flushing and refilling with fresh every couple of years. Be wary of the cars maintenance history when shopping around. Beyond this, a skilled knowledgeable mechanic should perform most repairs. There are several very good websites available to help you with care tips.

I understand that dealer repairs are expensive. Luckily, we have a local private garage (Bristol Motor Works, Bristol, CT) that specializes in German cars. We brought ours there once to have an overall mechanical inspection after we bought it. 

Gas mileage is typical of any V-8. That, coupled with the fact this one requires premium fuel, may be a consideration.

Even though our car has the optional traction control (ASC), ascending hills in the snow can be a challenge. Traction, however, seems superior to other rear-wheel cars I have driven.

With lots of appreciated features that still surprise us (although some are confusing), we are constantly impressed with BMW's engineering. An alert tone sounds, for instance, when the outside temperature dips below freezing.

 The quality control that went into this car is obvious to us: from the deep rich exterior paint, to the firm, but comfortable leather seats (heated). There are no rattles or squeaks even though our car is almost 10 years old and the odometer has almost turned over.

Long trips on the interstate is where this car shines. You feel safe, secure and unfatigued after marathon sessions on the road. Four passengers can ride in comfort as the back seat has more than ample room. A good sized trunk also contributes to the touring aspect of this model. 

It's no wonder the 5 series was voted one of the world's 10 best cars by Car & Driver Magazine back in '94.

On a more practical note, you will be hard pressed to find a different used car that does it all so well.
