            My husband and I started out in a small sports car, before the three kids, and slowly worked our way up.  When we finally broke down to buy a mini van it was only because an accident totaled our vehicle.  Driving a rental van for a month sold us on our GMC Safari.  Now having made over a years of rather large payments and not regretting a one of them we recommend this van to anyone in need of a mini van.

Our favorite things about our GMC Safari are it's size, it's comfort and it drives wonderfully.  The Safari is on a truck frame with a truck engine giving us more versatility and more room.  I can stand in our vehicle when needed to help my children, especially great on long road trips.  Also great on long road trips is our plush seating arrangements, the kids have great space and comfort in the back seats, we have also travelled many adults in the back seats of our van and they always rave about the leg room and comfort.  Our captains chairs in the front seat make our long road trips much more comfortable.  No more bad backs after a road trip.  Our van drives like a luxury vehicle while giving such versatility.

The only part that I can say I do not like about our van is the expense....while in my opinion it is worth what we pay, it is an expensive vehicle to own and maintain.  The gas mileage leaves room for desire and so does the sticker price.

I truly think any one looking for a vehicle to suit multiple needs especially those families living with one car and more than two children should look at a GMC Safari.  For the money it is the best you will find on the market, and we looked for 6 months.
