            We bought this truck right after our 3rd child was born.  We previously had a Ford Explorer and we were amazed at how cramped the 3 kids were in the back seat.  My husband refused to drive a minivan, so we decided on the Ford Expedition.  

It is a great truck.  We feel very safe driving our kids around in it.  I love the fact that it has an extra seat in the back end.  My son can have that seat to himself, which means less fighting between the kids.  It seats 7, so we can pile more people in and go places. 

It drives great, a smooth ride with plenty of foot room.  I was a little nervous about driving something so big, but it is really easy!  It has separate air conditioning/heat controls for the people in the back and it also has radio controls with headphone jacks for those in the back seat.  

One complaint is when the very back seat is down, there is hardly any cargo space.  So, if we need to use all of the seats, we can't fit much back there.  If we don't need all of the seats, it is very easy to fold that seat up to make more room.  It also uses a lot of gas, which is expected with such a big truck!

As a mother, with safety in mind, this truck makes me feel safe!  <br><br>
