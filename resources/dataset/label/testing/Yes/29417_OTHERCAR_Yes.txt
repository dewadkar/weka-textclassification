            [Note: this is a review written by somebody who likes to drive. I am not a car nut and I don't bother with stats or esoteric details, I just tell it like it is. I also assume that you know SOMETHING about the car - like I said, I don't bother with stats.]
  I realize that referring to this car as a "go kart on steroids" may usurp a negative connotation - but it's really the closest analogy that I can come up with. A go kart is pure driving fun - nimble and responsive, it feels fine-tuned to your reflexes. This is precisely the feeling that Porsche went for in designing the Boxster...and they succeeded. Of course, unlike the go kart, this car has quite a bit of muscle. Still, driving this car will put a pre-adolescent smile on anyone's face.
  Make no mistakes, the Boxster is a pure driving car. This is NOT a luxury car by any means. The stereo and speakers are mediocre at best. The overall dash/console feel is rather cheap. The climate control will leave you scratching your head. The seats (leatherette - natural leather is also available) are reasonably comfortable, yet rigid. The suspension is *very* stiff - this is part of the amazing handling, however. Take a sharp turn and you'll see what I mean :) Once again, do not expect a luxury car, you WILL be disappointed. This car is for people who enjoy driving as an art form and enjoy every inch of the road as much as the passing scenery.
  Being 6'2 and 250lbs, I can say that I am reasonably comfortable in the car while driving. An extended trip of a few hours is of little problem to me - and I have a bad back to boot. Of course, this may also be because adrenaline is constantly running through me while I'm behind the wheel. 
  I should note that the standard Boxster is not the most powerful car in its class (the more powerful S model is also available), but don't let its relatively low horsepower (around 220) fool you - this car has pep. Being one of the few people who likes the tiptronic transmission, I can say that it still makes for a fun ride. I've driven both manual and tip., but being from a high traffic area, tiptronic just seemed like a better option. The truth is, it's nothing like real manual driving. It tends to shift up really quickly..don't be surprised to find yourself in 5th gear while driving at slow speeds in the city. The tiptronic paddles are also prone to being accidentaly hit by wandering fingers on the steering wheel. I've hit them more than a few times while tapping along to a song. The shifting can be engaged even while being in pure automatic mode (you can switch to full "manual" mode by moving the shifter to M). You constantly see the gear you're in on the right side of the instrument panel with a little light next to it. There will also be a light for manual or automatic mode. Hitting a tiptronic pedal in automatic mode will put you in manual mode for a few seconds.
  The overall quality of the car seems pretty sound - minus the cheap interior, that is. The top goes up and down very easily - within 10 seconds or so (they say 12) and even with the top up, I found a surprising amount of headroom (being 6'2 and all). Noise exists no matter what with this car - and that's not a bad thing. It has the trademark Porsche roar which leaves you feeling like you're driving a much more powerful (and expensive) car. Speaking of the engine: it's not meant to be accessed by the owner - sans changing the fluids. You can make up your own mind about this. Also, luggage space is surprisingly plentiful for such a small car. Though, don't expect to put too much in the back trunk - it's not very deep and tends to heat up a bit.
  Overall, you'd need to take this car out for a test drive to understand it. I've driven 911's before, and comparing the two (Boxster to 911) is like comparing day and night (pardon the cliche). The Boxster IS NOT A 911. IT NEVER WILL BE A 911. IF YOU WANT A "POOR MAN'S 911", YOU'D BE BETTER OFF BUYING A USED ONE!! That's not a bad thing! The Boxster has a charm all its own. This is THE roadster experience. If you want something very affordable, go to the Miata. If you want something more powerful, yet still reasonable, check out the Z3 or the TT. if you want luxury, the SLK is for you. If you want raw power, luxury, and the ability to fit more than two, then the M3 was made for you. Each of these cars offer something the Boxster doesn't..but after having driven every single one of them, I can safely say that nothing holds a candle to the Boxster for pure driving fun. It's as if all the aforementioned cars were trying to capture something that Porsche got right some 5 decades ago. If you like to drive, or just want to make the daily commute seem like an adventure, you owe it yourself to at least test drive the Boxster.
More stuff: Mileage is "ok" - roughly 20mpg in mixed driving - large tank. Maintenance seems to be reasonable so far. Regular upkeep is fine - nothing fancy. Uses synthetic oil, needs to be changed every 12k miles. Etc etc. Always buckle your seatbelts.
[Update: Found this picture of a cross section of the Boxster taken at the Porsche museum. It may put some things into perspective. http://vista.pca.org/sfl/images/factory7.jpg   ]
