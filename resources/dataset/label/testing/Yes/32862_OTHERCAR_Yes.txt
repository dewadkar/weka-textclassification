            Although I've been a little bit of a hobbyist photographer for about 20 years, this was my first digicam. I did a lot of reading at the various related website, and decided the 880 seemed like the best match for my priorities, which were: 1) image quality 2) responsiveness 3) portability 4) manual controls.

Image quality can be very good, with subtle, clear pictures. But I've done a fair amount of low-light action shooting, which is admittedly a very challenging situation for any camera, and for this the 880 comes up a little short. Then again, I'd probably have to spend several times the 880's purchase price to get better results. Unlike some people, I've seen a lot of red-eye with the flash.

Responsiveness, although good, could be better. As I understand it, the 880 is considered a fast digicam, but the warm-up time and shutter-press to image-capture time both could be faster.

Portability is pretty good. Not an Elph--it won't slip into a hip pocket--but easy to carry around. Ideally it would come with a built-in lens cap (like the Elph) to make it more convenient as a knocking-around camera.

Manual controls are pretty good. It admittedly only gives coarse control over aperture, but other than that, it offers all the controls you'd want, and probably a few you wouldn't expect. I find the user-interface for most things to be pretty convenient. A lot of the options either require the screen be turned on, or I haven't figured out how to bypass it--this is my only real criticism here.

In addition to all this stuff, the 880 includes the much-mentioned Scene mode, which I've rarely used, but seems like a nice gimmick for beginners.

The camera comes with only an 8 MB card, which is pathetic, and no rechargeable battery/charger, which should be considered mandatory. Expect to spend another $100 for the battery and charger, and at least $100 again for a bigger CF card. I've been getting about 60 shots per charge on the battery, which is rated &quot;poor&quot; according to the Epinions scale, but since I only get about 42 shots (at high quality and high res) on a 64 MB memory card, I really see no need for longer life--I don't consider this a problem<br><br>
