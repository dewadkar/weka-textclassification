            I bought my Isuzu Trooper SE the summer of 1992 because my husband and I were planning on starting a family &amp; we needed a bigger car, I also live in Connecticut so we needed a 4 wheel drive car.  I also was into showing horses and I needed a car with a big cargo area.

If I had to choose whether I love or hate this vehicle I would say I love it!  In the 8 years (and 100,000 miles)I have owned it nothing has gone wrong with it.  I made sure I had the oil changed every 3,000 miles and the tires rotated every 5,000 miles.  I drove my car to Virginia &amp; I found the seats were pretty comfortable (not like a sofa or anything but....) it is great on gas mileage and you can use the cheap stuff and it still runs well.  The car has no rust due to my washing it 4 or 5 times a month, more in the winter &amp; waxing it 2 or 3 times a year.  The 4 wheel drive is easy to put into gear &amp; take out. The granny gear is wonderful on steep hills.  The thing I love most about the Trooper is the split doors that opens up the back of the car.  I have a bad back &amp; being able to go flush up against the bumper to take stuff out is wonderful. 

The two things I HATE about this car is the moaning &amp; squeaking of the brakes, and not having intermitent (sp?) windshield wipers! (it really does make a difference)In the first 3 months I owned this car I had 7 sets of brakes put on it due to the moaning.  I kept bringing it into my local Isuzu dealer &amp; they kept saying lets try another set of brakes, and I come to find out they did not know what caused it!  So after trying everything under the sun to stop the moaning I just learned to live with it.  It does not do it all the time but alot of the time.  

I really like driving this vehicle because it was almost always the highest vehicle out there on the road so it would let you see traffic jams ahead.  It is not the fastest vehicle out there, but I knew that when I bought it.  It is easy to handle &amp; easy to park.  It is an animal when climbing hills in the winter.  I live on a driveway that is about a 90 degree angle and I have never worried about getting up it.  Only once in 11 years have I not been able to get up my driveway &amp; that was the horrible storm of '94 or '95.

I think anyone that wants a good priced and dependable SUV should buy a Trooper.  I do not know how the new ones are but I would buy another 1991!
The people that should not buy this car are the ones that would freak out if the slightest thing went wrong with the car!<br><br>
