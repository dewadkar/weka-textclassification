            Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first.  Fuel mileage is very erratic.  I get between 39 mpg all the way up to 56 mpg.  Still better than any car I have ever owned.  This has a small car ride.  It is a rough ride and you feel all the bumps and potholes in the road.  Almost no options available and you have to take what comes in at your dealership.  No arm rests.  No discounts, no rebates, no hagling, you pay what you see.  Very little luggage space.  Scuba gear takes up the entire trunk.  This car should be built as a hatch back with fold down seats.  Slow to accelerate from 50 mph to 70 mph.  Passing requires a lot of room.  Poor stereo sound.  Needs better speakers for sure.  Small back seat room.  High wind noise above 60 mph.  You gotta get used to the location of the speedometer.  Who thought that one up?  The battery is located in the L/H trunk and if you don't drive it everyday, it will run down and you have to jump it off.  This by far is the worst of the Cons.  Now for the good stuff.  The fuel mileage!!!  That is why I bought this car and I am enjoying it very much.  This car is very peppy from start to about 50 mph.  Going to the Arkansas Razorback games through the mountains is still no problems and gets the job done but, the engine you can tell, is still straining.  What Toyota needs to do is make this car a hatchback, increase horsepower in the 50 mph to 70 mph range, offer more options & colors, improve stereo system, decrease wind noise, allow dealers to deal, set up a trickle charger for people that do not drive every day and put the speedometer where it belongs!
