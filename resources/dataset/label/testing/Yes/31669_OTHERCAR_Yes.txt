            We purchased a Chevrolet 1995 G-20 conversion van, with a high top a little less than 5 years ago.  This van has everything!!  We've used it for many extended trips and it has always been comfortable and reliable, even during a 16 hour trip that was non-stop except for gas, food, etc. Gas mileage averages 16 miles per gallon on a trip, a little less in the city.  We opted for the manufacturer's rust proofing, which was a mistake. We live in a cold climate with a lot of snow and ice in the winter which means there is a lot of salt on the roads during that time. The Cevy dealer inspects the van yearly and always tells us he sees no rust, but we can certainly see it and have not been happy with this particular service.  The high top was also a mistake for us because none of the local car wash centers have high enough ceilings to take it.  There is also a problem with underground parking and we always have to look for above ground parking lots in the area cities.  The van has needed only rountine maintenance.
During long trips our grandchildren have been entertained with the TV and super nintendo options which were part of the conversion package.  There is plenty of space for luggage, good footroom for everyone and cupholders as well as small packages of kleenex near every one of the 7 seats.  Backseat lighting is also very good for those who want to read, look at maps, etc. Acceleration on inclines is good and the van is very maneuverable in all traffic situations.  All in all, it's a great ride!<br><br>
