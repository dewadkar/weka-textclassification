             I was shopping for a versatile minivan that was reliable. Owning a Honda 
Accord, I looked at the Odyssey.
 After driving it more than a month, it seems to be a very good choice.
 The part that separates it from the rest of the vans, is the &quot;Magic&quot; third seat.  It folds into the floor to leave a large flat area for lots of cargo. Anyone who regularly needs to carry big things, and then needs the third seat back, will appreciate it.
  I cant imagine where I would put a removable third seat.

  It drives well, controls are convenient. I love that it has separate lights and controls in the back for rear passengers. They can have different temperature in back. There is a front control to turn off access from back for annoying small children.

   It not underpowered..3.5 engine. Transmission is real smooth and quiet.
 Has many small features..like folding shelf in between front seats. Four captain chairs. Mid chairs slide away from each other or together as bench seat.
