            The 1993 Mercury Cougar is nothing but reliable. If you are the type of person that doesn't baby your car and loves to drive, consider this car. The interior. Seats are very comfortable for long drives with lumbar support and electronic controls. Room in back is tight. Behind me is worse I have long legs so one passenger in the back seat is tops unless a child.  Factory radio is nice. No real need to upgrade to aftermarket. The only regret I have with this car is I got the 3.8l and not the V8. However the 3.8l has nice pickup and is not afraid to run. The Cougar handles Great. Hugs the road like an old lover. No regrets from the purchase of this car. I own 4 and this is my daily driver. Kudos to Mercury<br><br>
