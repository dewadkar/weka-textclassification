                 I bought this car from a dealer. He had ordered it new for his wife and it was classed as a program car when sold.
     This was the last year a Dynasty was produced. It was a sharp car. Burgundy with Stainless Steel trim. Used car price was only around $14,000.00 dollars. This car retailed in new at $20,000.00, so we thought it was an exceptional price. It was in showroom condition when we got it and when we sold it two years later for 12,500.00. We felt like we drove it for two years for free.
     When I sold it, it was not actually for sale, I had someone call me up and beg me to sell it to them, to name my price so I did. When it was sold it had 53,000 miles on the engine and the lady who bought it put another 53,000 miles on it in a year and a half ! She then let her daughter have the car and she bought a new sport utility vehicle.
     This is one of the best cars that Chrysler EVER made of any kind. 
I wish that it could be revived, because I would be in line to buy a new one. I wished many a time that I had NOT sold it and bought a new small compact piece of medal and plastic that was called a car !<br><br>
