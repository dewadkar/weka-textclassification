            I bought this vehicle used in 1998.  Its sporty and affordably priced...the Eclipse is the easiest car to &quot;pimp out&quot; and people do stare.  the interior is small  and its hard for large people to drive or even ride in.The back seat is almost non- existent but it is definitely a nice- looking car and even after the new 2000, i still get stares.   The only problems have been in snow...the car has spun out numerous times....don't drive in the snow....don't buy it if you live in a place where snow is a threat....I have missed school and work simply because i couldn't get there.....but it sure looks great at the beach!<br><br>
