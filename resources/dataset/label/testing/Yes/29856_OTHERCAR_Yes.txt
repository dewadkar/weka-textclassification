            Kodak's DC-265 digital camera is an improved version of their now defunct DC-260.  Having both a DC-260, DC-265, and DC-290 in my collection of digital cameras, if you've got the cash, you're better off going with the DC-290.

First, the good things about the DC-265:  The photographs are decent, and at well more than one megapixel, they're good for printing out 5x7 prints, and if you're willing to stand a bit of bluriness, even 8x10 prints.  The camera has a 2x optical zoom, auto white-balance, and is relative easy to use and operate.  I lent it to someone who had never used a digital camera in their lives before and he figured out how to turn it on and take photographs in 5 minutes.

However, the DC-265 lacks a couple of things that make the DC-290 a much better choice.  First, the 290 offers far superior resolution, and much sharper photographs.  You'll notice the difference when you print your photographs out on a photo printer or look at it on a high resolution monitor like the Apple cinema display.  Second, the camera is REALLY slow, such that you have to wait nearly a three or more seconds before you can snap another photograph.  Finally, the camera works horribly in low-light conditions--you'll need add on a powerful flash if you want to see anything at all when you're indoors.

Nevertheless, as a consumer digital camera, it takes decent photographs, is easy to learn, and does what you want.  But if you've got an extra hundred bucks, go for the DC-290--the better photos are worth it.<br><br>
