            Let me start by saying I am 18 years old, so my reasons for liking/disliking this car will most likely vary from most people.

I bought this car about 6 months ago used, and have changed the oil once, and the battery once (the battery was my fault, leaving the dome light on for several days).  It has been a sturdy car, and i've never doubted it's ability to get me where I'm going. As far as maintenance goes, it's a Honda, and I shouldn't have to say anymore.

The interior is designed well.  The front seats have more than sufficient room, and the rear seats serve their purpose.  The rear could use more leg room, but hey, this isn't a Cadillac, it's a Civic.  Everything on the dash is easy to read and locate, and has a little bit of style to it. The trunk is large for such a small car, which really makes the car great for road trips for 2 people, 3 if someone doesn't mind laying across the back seat (it's to cramped to sit correctly in the back for any more than 4 hours).  

The sound system isn't terrible, but it's not the best.  For and average driver it will get the job done.  15 watt 6x9's in the rear and 15 watt 6.5's in the front.  However, if this isn't enough for you, you won't have an easy time upgrading.  The 6x9's are top mounted, but not accessable from the top without Removing the whole back panel, which requires removing the rear side panels. That seems like a little too much work just to replace the speakers.  The 6.5's are as simple as can be expected to replace.

The fuel economy is beyond exceptional.  On an average tank (86 octane mind you) I get about 35 mpg.  I don't exactly drive it like an economy car either, constantly pushing redline in first and second gear just for fun, so 35 mpg isn't shabby in any way.  On long trips I try to get better milage, and I have got up to 46 mpg on a trip from Dallas to Austin and back.  This is about 10 mpg more than the Toyota Echo which is a 2000 model and was made specifically for fuel economy.

Although it's gas milage is so good, it doesn't make it a dog.  It has 115 horsepower, which isn't a lot, but it's enough to get 0-60 in under 10 seconds.  When buying this car though, don't expect to take a M3 from the line though.  It has 8 more horsepower than the LX or DX models of Civic, yet better gas milage than the two.  The EX takes it by 17 horsepower over the HX I beleive, but a manual HX has a chance against an EX automatic.

The exterior is sturdy, I've bumped it and it'll bounce back.  Rocks off of those annoying dump trucks that always hit your hood and windshield have yet to leave any noticable marks.  The car had a very small dent when I bought it, you can't see it unless you're looking for it which I don't know how it got there.  The body is aerodynamic enough where I have done at least 100 mph without the body shaking.

It handles well, with decent tires a 90 degree turn at 30 mph shouldn't present a huge problem.  The car is quiet enough where you can hear everyone inside without any trouble, but makes enough noise you can tell when the engine could really use the next gear.  You can feel the car's movement through the wheel, but not excessively to where your hands shake after you've driven it.  You can feel the tourque through the stick shift, which is helpful if you're stereo's up to high, and you need to pay more antention to the road than your odometer.  

Conclusion - 

Why I bought this vehicle:  It's a Honda, so I knew it would last.  I could afford it.  And it felt nice on the test drives.

Who should buy this vehicle:  This make a great car for getting to where your going locally.  If you typically only only need to suit one person (drive to work, grocery store, etc.) than this car is perfect.  If you're trying to impress someone however, no car at this price will to to hot in that category, you'll just have to spend more money (maybe on a Civic SI?)

Really, this car gives you more than what you pay for, but it might not be enough for some people.<br><br>
