            Ah.... Land Rover, how do I love thee?  Your grace over obstacles, your prowess in mud, sand, or snow, your towering silhouette, your versatile cargo area, your commanding driving position, the looks you get on the road, your impressive and lengthy history, your incredible worldwide network of enthusiasts, the strength of your construction, your level of safety, the ease with which you conquer inclement weather ... lets see... have I even scratched the surface?  Truth be told, there is so much I love about my Discovery that I can't even begin to list it all here.  The amount of luxury that you get for your dollar is amazing.  Plus, one look at the undercarriage, and you'll understand how ruggedly these vehicles are built.  They have a massive box frame (into which all of the vulnerable components are tucked), huge disc brakes, and durable tires, and everything is built for strength.  71% of all of the Land Rovers ever built aren't still on the road today for nothin'.  

Now, my head isn't so in the clouds that I didn't notice some things that aren't perfect with the Discovery.  For one thing, Europeans don't bring their drinks into the car, so the concept of cupholders is foreign to them.  As a result, there are tiny cupholders that are right in front of the HVAC controls.  You can't fit anything bigger than a soda can in them, and you have to move your drink to change the A/C.  It's hard to get into the rear seats, and once you're back there, they are pretty small.  I carry cargo instead of people, though, so that doesn't really matter to me.  In fact, I completely removed my rear seats so that I had more cargo room (with the front seats pushed all the way forward, you can sleep inside).  Also, I do have to admit that maintenance costs are pretty high... but they're high for anything nowadays.  Anyway, it's a luxury vehicle, so you have to expect higher costs.  Are these cons livable?  Absolutely.  They're negligible compared to the pros.

How my love affair with Land Rover started: When I first started shopping for SUVs, I never even thought of a Land Rover.  I just assumed that they were way out of my price range.  Once I started doing my research, though, I found that they were truly comparable in price to the more plebian SUVs.  I was coming from a Volvo, so safety was a big concern for me.  I was also very concerned about roll overs.  I was living in the Blue Ridge Mountains, so I wanted to be able to go off-roading.  And, as a college student, I knew I would be hauling things around all the time.  The Discovery seemed like a perfect match.  Its height really threw me, though.  I was terrified of rolling over on the back mountain roads I drove on every day.  One trip to the dealership and over the capabilities course, and my fears were totally gone.  There was no way this baby was going over.  With that obstacle out of the way, the Discovery became an absolute possibility.  After comparing the options between the SUVs in my price range, I finally landed on an Epsom Green 1996 Land Rover Discovery SD with manual leather seats, a factory CD changer, and full rubber mats throughout.  I have NEVER had even one iota of regret about my decision.  
Within one month of buying "Lucas," I attended my first Land Rover Rally.  After seeing the INCREDIBLE things I could accomplish in my totally stock vehicle, I was hooked.  I was officially developing into a Land Rover nut.  Every bit of my spare time started going into talking about Land Rovers on the internet, finding accessories that I could add to "Lucas," and devising a plan for his development.  Now, after a year and a half, I have a Safari Gard Front Bumper with the integrated skid plate & cad plated d-ring, a Superwinch Husky 8000 winch, front and rear
SG differential guards, the genuine Adventure Roof Rack, a 
Rear ladder, OME HDs springs all around, Warn Black Diamond XT shocks up front, Rancho 5000s in back, Rockware Rock Sliders, 4 Hella 3000s on the Roof Rack, 2 Hella 530s on the bumper, a Big ole KC Daylighter for a rear lamp, a weatherproof CB, a 60" Hi-Lift on a custom roof-rack mount, 
Genuine rubber floor mats & loadspace mat, Genuine CD changer, SG drop kit, 7.00 x 15 Power King Super Traction Tread Tires mounted on 15" Series III steel wheels painted Caterpillar Yellow, a torque-biasing True Trac front Limited Slip differential, and a few other little goodies.
..and I can assure you the list will only get longer.  I LOVE my Discovery.

Now I am the events coordinator for one of the largest clubs in the northeast, and I've turned my hobby into a full-time job-- I now work for Land Rover.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

Now, would I recommend the Discovery to everyone?  No.  There are definitely other SUVs out there that will meet your needs if you will only drive around town.  Some people don't need permanent four wheel drive, or are very concerned about fuel efficiency.  I wouldn't buy a Discovery as a commuter vehicle, because it's really just too much truck (and therefore too expensive) for mundane point-A-to-point-B driving.  However, it is the absolutely most perfect weekend vehicle.  Take it camping, fishing, boating, hunting, surfing, skiing, biking, wherever.  You truly can go anywhere.  If you never plan to go off-road, or you don't plan to do extensive driving in bad weather, you don't have to tow anything, and you don't have more than 2 kids, the points that make the Discovery great won't really matter to you.  If you want a safe, comfortable, and affordable luxury vehicle with lots of versatility and the ability to conquer anything you throw at it, then go to your Land Rover dealer right away.  All of the Sales Guides are enthusiasts about Land Rovers, and they are extremely knowledgeable about the product.  ...and don't pass up a chance to go on the test track.  It just may change your mind about what you want in a vehicle!
