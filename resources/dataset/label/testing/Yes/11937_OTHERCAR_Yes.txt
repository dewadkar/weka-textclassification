            I was gong to make a trip to England,Israel, and Jordan.  I wanted a camera that would take high quality pictures for a reasonable price.  I purchased the Agfa 780 because I believed it would do just that.  It allows you to set it too four different levels of quality, which is good.  It came with a 2mg. card, which I believed was too small so I purchased an 8mg. card which gave me 141 high quality pictures.  I also purchased Lithium batteries which will last several time as long as alkaline.  I was pleased that they lasted through the whole trip and the gauge showed that they were still full when I returned.  The only negative about the camera is the fact that it doesn't swivel allowing you to take pictures over the head of people in front of you.  I didn't realize what an advantage that would be until I got into crowds at the various tourist attractions.<br><br>
