            I have owned many cars in my time however none to the power of my 1995 Pontiac Firebird.
The horsepower is great, I have a 5.7 liter engine and a six speed tranny. It corners great and at high speeds so nicely. Sleek looking and medium sized. I bought this vehicle about 4 months ago I was looking at the Cameros when I found this vehicle on the lot. Started it up and fell in love the sound of it says power power.
     I really think this vehicle is more for the younger or young at heart.
The only problem that I have found is after taking it on a 8 hour drive that I would of really liked a sedan for long trips it is a around town car and speed demon.  But long trips can kill the back and buttocks area.
It has too much power for teens I think because I almost lost it once just changing into second wow what power.
I paid around 13,000 for my Firebird and the money was worth it.
Want some power?
