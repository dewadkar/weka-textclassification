            After looking at the competition (BMW 3 series, Audi A4, Nissan Maxima) I visited a Volvo dealer just for the heck of it.  I was pleasantly surprised at the S40.

Starting at just $23500, and with lots of standard stuff, it looked like a great deal.  We added cold weather, touring, and sunroof packages which quickly jacked the price up past $28000.  Still a great deal though.

  The dealer was excellent.  High level of service &amp; personal attention.  And my lease deal was incredible.  I called the Audi dealer back and gave him all the numbers and asked him what he could do.  He called me back in 1/2 hour and told me he couldn't come anywhere near the deal, even though the A4 1.8t with Quattro was only $29000.

I have been very impressed with the Volvo.  Leather seats are great.  Good A/C.  Nice sounding stereo.  Great details too, like a pencil in the accident report kit in the glove compartment, and gloves in the tool kit.  I have been very satisfied.  Impressed with the performance out of the 1.9 turbo also.<br><br>
