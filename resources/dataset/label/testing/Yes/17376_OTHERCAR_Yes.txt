            The '99 Eclipse the end of an era. The '00 models are completely different, coming only with a V6, with no turbo available. Not to mention the increased size, weight, and the, uh, distinctive styling. If you've admired the Eclipse, move now while dealers are clearing their lots..because they won't make 'em like this much longer.

Despite the reputation for unreliability the 1st generation Eclipse/Talon has, I am very happy with the '99 Eclipse RS.  The base model, at 140hp isn't the fastest thing on the road, but its very spirited and handles very well..even for a front-wheel-drive car. The GS model doesn't seem to be worth the extra money..it merely adds more gadgets - not even leather seats as standard. A/C is the only desired option the GS gives over the RS, and most cars on the lot are so equipped.  Even still, the RS is plenty comfy for a 'stripper' model.
 
True speed freaks will lust after the turbocharged all-wheel-drive models, but the RS is a decent car in its own right. A possible deterrant for me against the car were the legions of obnoxious low-rider boy-racer types so fond of their oversized wheels &amp; booming stereos. I didn't want to be one of 'them'. 
Comparing the Eclipse against the competition, however, made me discount the Goofball Factor on account of the incredible value. For $20,000, it's hard to beat the Eclipse. The Probe is much too 'soft' and 'chick-car'-ish for my taste. It feels like a 2-door Taurus, frankly. More of the same for the V6 Mustang (we won't discuss the 'Stang's fuel mileage or it's Goofball Quotient, either). Other cars in the running were the Honda Civic (WAY too common, too expensive, and the theft rate is astronomical - again, I blame the backwards-baseball-hat crowd), Nissan 240SX was too 'fat' and expensive, had uninteresting styling, and delivered a less than inspiring driving experience. Honda Prelude was far too expensive, and just not worth the money, IMHO. The Mazda Miata was quickly ruled out after one look at its pitiful trunk.

Actually, the closest competitor to the '99 Eclipse was..a 95-97 Eclipse. We truly didn't want to drop 20 large on a commuter car, but after looking at used models, it was clear that most had lived hard lives in the stead of wanna-be Mario Andrettis, and the depreciation rate just didn't compensate for the run-down condition of most cars. One more reason to buy new, I suppose..even a beat-up Eclipse is worth a bit. 
 
Now, down to brass tacks...
The stereo system's excellent, all gauges are clear &amp; easy to read, visibility is good for a hatchback (which offers reasonable space considering the car's size..and with the rear seats down there's a -lot- of space) Ah, the rear seats. This is a 2+2 ..meaning that +2 better be someone short, preferrably a child, a pet, or a legless mannequin. I've seen worse backseats in cars of this class (Prelude comes to mind), and do transport adults back there occasionally, so its not quite the torture chamber, for example, a Porsche 911's rear 'pads' would be. 

For $20k, the '99 Eclipse is a sporty fun car that's economical to own, looks good (especially if you dont get the silly St. Louis Arch spoiler), and won't bore you to tears.  
If this sounds like what you're looking for, move fast..the 2000's are trickling in, and boy, are they a disappointment.<br><br>
