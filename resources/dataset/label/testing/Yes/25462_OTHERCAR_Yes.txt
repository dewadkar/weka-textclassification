            My 1998 Saturn SL1 was the 2nd car I've owned. The first was a 1989 Hyundai Excel (I know, I know...) And let me tell you, it's a dream compared to that old clunker!

I literally drove my Excel *smoking* into the dealership - I was pretty desperate. But the Saturn people were kind, friendly and informative. They even bought my old car (it really wasn't worth anything, but they gave me $50 for it)

Here's my thoughts on the SL1:

-Engine: While the engine is a tad loud (my friend comments that it's the loudest car he's heard), it's extremely reliable. I haven't had a problem with it in the slightest, and we're going on 60,000 miles now.

-Trunk: Extremely roomy. I regularly carry 2 sets of rollerblades, helmets and miscellaneous junk, and I still can fit a trip to the supermarket in there!

-Back seat: A little cramped, but I don't use it much. Most people don't complain about it.

-Audio: I have the tape player (Next car gets an MP3/CD player) and the audio is fine for the non-discriminating ear.

-Mirrors: The mirrors are *trouble*. I have had my passenger-side mirror knocked completely OFF...twice! (Once was a side-swiped collision, the other poor parking) I've since mentioned to the dealership and to Saturn headquarters themselves to change the design of the mirrors. They recognize the problem and will be fixing it.

-Service: I've only really taken my Saturn to be serviced by the Saturn people, and it's a little pricy. But they always do a bang-up job, and I've never had a problem with them. The 60,000 tune up will really COST you, though (about $300!)

-Driving: It drives fine, except it doesn't really grip the road in icy/snowy/heavy-rains. I've changed the tires once, but it didn't do a darn thing. I'm wary of this, so I drive slow.

Note: If you *do* go for one of these, get the electronics package. You'll kick yourself if you don't!

Did I miss anything? I hope not. If so, let me know and I'll add some more of my two cents. :-)
