            With a sport look to it that my mother loves, the 4X4 capability that my father bought it for her for. The great looks of driving it for the college age kids it is defiantly a family vehicle. This is the road 4X4 for the City Street. It handles like a car it can take on the snow in 4X4 with out a problem. The ABS breaks perform well in all kinds of weather. With a couple times in the shop for a defective transmission a year after purchase. The interior is comfortable, drives to work or the trip to grandmaï¿½s house . The back seat sits 2 comfortably but 3 adults is not comfortable. The finish on the car scratches easily at the car-wash . The built in display council on the ceiling is great. With the security system standard in most editions and the remote key less entry standard. The cargo capacity is great in the rear. With the ability to remove the back seat in either of the two sections. They come out easily and go back in just as easy. Good all around for all drivers.<br><br>
