            My wife's grandmother bought this 1999 lumina new. She passed away February 2001, and I bought it from my mother-in-law in March 2001.  Reminds me of my teenage years when I drove my dad's luxury cars.  I'm an insurance agent and usually drive 700 to 1,000 miles a week. I NEED COMFORT!  For about three months I drove my wife's Nissan Xterra and the first week I drove the lumina I thought I was in heaven.  I have arthritis in my back and legs plus a few bulging disc in my back and driving this comfortable lumina has really helped a lot.  I really like the roomy interior and the quiet ride also.  Railroad tracks and road imperfections doesn't phase this car.  I wouldn't want to hit a large pothole, but wouldn't want to do that in any car.

The lumina has numerous little storage compartments that come in real handy.  I have cloth seats and they are very comfortable to me.  All the controls are easy to reach and operate.  I do wish my cruise control was in the center of the steering wheel and that there were cup holders in the back seat, but I don't plan on riding in the back and my kids don't need an excuse to have a soda back there to spill anyway.

I really like the stereo's self-adjusting volume control based on noise level. Also the daytime running lights, and with the lumina, you don't have to worry about getting your name called out over the intercom in Wal-Mart that you left your headlights on.

Overall, I would highly recommend the lumina.  It is very affordable for a car that is as roomy, comfortable, and reliable as it is.  Has a very nice size trunk, lots of little storage compartments, good visibility from the drivers seat, and 27-28 mpg isn't bad.  You need to use the cruise control when you can though, cause you can be going 80mph before you know it.
