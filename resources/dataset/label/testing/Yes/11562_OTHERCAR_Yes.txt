            I bought my 1999 Jeep cherokee a few months ago and can't get enough of it. It is perhaps the most amazing vehichle I have ever bought.  I bought it new fully loaded with a black exterior and a gray interior.  This vehicle is amazing in SO many ways.  I am married and have 4 children and this suv makes it so much easier to travel.  There is so much space in the back for my kids and their friends, as well plenty of room for other stuff like groceries.  This vehicle handles amazingly in four wheel drive or in two wheel drive. It is great for snowy days because you have so much more control on the road.  It has alot of pep and power.  Me and my wife can never decide who is going to drive because we both love driving it so much.  We bought it because it was affordable and the Jeep name is dependable.  A great vehicle all around. I would definitely encourage anybody who has a family to get one. It is a must have.<br><br>
