            This is a positive review on a fuji 2600 digital camera.  The other digital camera I own is a Kodak dc4800 which is a 3 mp camera with more features.  

The fuji 2600 was purchased as a gift for my father after examining all the various 2 mp compact cameras on the market.  The chief competitors I looked at were the Canon A20 / S100 and the kodak DC 3600/3900 series.

The decision to purchase this camera is based upon its EASY, SIMPLE features.  There aren't too many options for you to adjust but for the techno-novice (my father), this is a good thing.  It comes with a good selection of software, rechargable batteries (a must on  a digital camera) and a 16 mb card.  It also includes a charger and cables.  Few other systems are in the same package range for this price.

CAVEAT - you can get a Fuji 4700 on sale for the same price as this camera.  A little larger but more features (now discontinued item though).


After unpacking and installing the software, the camera interfaced quite readily with the computer.  Transfer of images was automatic and flawless.

STILL PICTURES

Colours were bright and although the LCD image was a bit dull in daylight, the images displayed/printed fine.  The 2 mp setting allows enlargements to 8x10 to be made at near photo quality.  For regular 4x6 pictures, there is no problem with image quality.

Load/save times were short and responsive and the built-in flash worked well.  Please note that almost ALL digital cameras have weak flashes overall.

The included rechargable batteries lasted for about 50-100 pictures (depending on LCD / flash use).  HOWEVER,  because the camera uses generic AA sized batteries, it is quite easy to pop in  a set of duracells as backup.   Indeed, you can buy NIMH rechargables at walmart for about $10 if you so wished.

The included 16 mb storage card is good for about 20 high res pictures at the max resolution which is good.  My first purchase for this camera would be a larger storage card though.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by image and colour quality.



USELESS MOVIES

The camera includes a "movie mode" which lets you captures up to 15 seconds of low resolution (no flash) pictures.  There is no sound with these images.  It is pretty gimmicky and although it works, I cannot imagine anytime when you would actually use this feature.


PRICE

For $499 (canadian), the camera provides a good deal.  Please note that you can get the kodak cameras for MUCH cheaper as they are on sale now.  However, I found the FUJI to have better quality pictures overall - which is what counts.


OVERALL

If you are in a market for a 2 mp digital camera, you can't go wrong with the fuji 2600.  The lack of adjustments (ISO, TIFF Modes, etc...) relegates it to novice-early intermediate digital camera users.  For snapshots, it cannot be beat, especially with the built in 3x zoom.  The included battery charger and 16 mb storage cards are nice additions to an economical package.

Please note, digital camera technology is in rapid flux at this time and you should carefully consider whether you wish to wait for new technology or buy now.
