            After another trip with the in-laws with me or my wife stuck in the back of the Jeep, it is time to get a car with more than 5 seats.  A seven or more passenger vehicle would have to replace the Corvette.  A mini-van would not do (to abrupt a transition), so a quick stop at the Land Rover Dealer was made to see what they had to offer.

[Dealership Experience]
I was greeted promptly and the salesman began describing the 2000 Land Rover Discovery II: Power headlight washers, beeswax filled 14 Gage steel frame, high torque engine &quot;you know torque is what counts more than horsepower,&quot; Solid Live Axle, &quot;I need a copy of your drivers license.&quot;  &quot;What for?&quot;  &quot;You do want to go for a test drive, don�t you?&quot;  We are off.  First stop it a 25degree up-slope of boulders.  Not a problem, you can feel some of the wheels slip, but the Electronic Traction Control (ETC) pulses the brakes on the slipping wheel and up we go.  Over the top and we start looking down a 35 degree slope.  Hit the Hill Descent Control (HDC) take a foot off the brake and we glide down at 4 MPH.  Stop halfway down and put on the parking brake, slip into neutral and we are frozen in place; &quot;the parking break isn�t a cable system, it is a 10 inch drum brake on the rear output shaft.&quot;  Undo the brake, head down the rest of the hill, make a left onto a 30 degree side slope and stop.  The low center of gravity means we will not tip; &quot;We can go up to 45 degrees.&quot;  Maybe next time.  Start up again and we are ready for the road test.  Talk about an &quot;E&quot; ticket ride!

Off we go onto I495.  It gets up to speed but having driven Corvettes for the last 15 years the acceleration seems tame.  It does get the job done and we are up to speed; remember that talk about torque.  Up some hills, down some hills, off to some stop and go traffic, and we are back at the dealership.  &quot;What did you think?  Come back when you are ready.&quot;   Talk about no hassle or strong arming techniques.  This a case of the product selling itself and the dealer having the right environment to allow the Land Rover to shine.

[Exterior]
While many of the other SUVs are rounding their figures, the Discovery II  is a box on wheels; make that a box that can go anywhere on wheels.  It is a truck and will not appeal to the mainstream.  &quot;It�s just plain ugly&quot; says my coworker, then he pushes me towards a mini-van (Don�t go there!).

[Interior]
Here the touch of British class.  Leather is optional (and pricy at almost $2K but the stereo is upgraded and seats are powered too) but plush.  The seating is high and commanding.  The back seats are a little cramped and the third row seat passengers must be 5 foot or smaller to be comfortable on long rides.  The two extra seat are about another $2K but remember what the objective was: 7 seats or higher that was not a mini-van.
[Engine]
The &quot;Thor&quot; V-8 will not win any drag races but does have that low end torque as promised.  It is an Aluminum block with Steel cylinder liners with only two valves per cylinder.  Not too much mechanical sophistication here but the management system is a Bosch Motronic 5.2.1 ( the BMW influence).  Seems like lots of room in the engine compartment compared to the Jeep (5.2 liter V-8) and the Vette (5.7 liter V-8).  Lots of room to work without busting your knuckles.

[Noise Level]
Did not notice a problem with this first test but on another day trip with a Active Cornering Enhancement (ACE) and Self-Leveling Suspension (SLS) equipped model, there was plenty of noise.  Believe it was all the hydraulics pushing and pulling at the suspension.  The engine noise was also a bit louder that would be expected.  But with the 320 Watt stereo, compensation could be done (maybe some of those anti-noise headsets that the pilots use).

[Overall]
Good, solid, go anywhere ( and I mean anywhere) in comfort vehicle.  The engine could be a little bigger (or grow a valve or two per cylinder) to give some more acceleration (about twice as slow as the Corvette 0 to 60 measured on a road, much faster than the Corvette on boulders).  The ACE does not seem ready for prime time: brand new system, very complex, and almost a $3K add on.
