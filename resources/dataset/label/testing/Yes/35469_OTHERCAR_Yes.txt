            I'm very happy with Sony products and their cybershot line is no exception. I had the Sony Cybershot F505-V for about a year and a half before I sold it to get the much upgraded Sony Cybershot F707.

I took thousands of photos with my F505-V but the F707 was a major upgrade that I had to get.  The first feature that caught my eye on the F707 was the holographic laser focus beam. This makes it so easy for taking shots in dark, poorly lit areas such as a bar or restaurant.

Another nice upgrade was the switch from the S-Type lithium ion battery to the longer lasting M-Type.

I almost forgot to mention the FIVE megapixels! The pictures come out gorgeous and with awesome detail. Cropping and printing large prints is no problem.

One of the downfalls that my previous F505-V had was the "blue flash". This would cause the skin color of people to look sorta greyish-blue or unnatural when taken indoors. The F707, on the other hand, has an excellent flash. The skin tone of people look very natural and the shots are very sharp.

Some of the other great features of the F707:
* Good Metering
* Bright, vivid colors
* Excellent build quality
* I love the macro lens
* Easy to use camera controls (most on the outside of cam)
* Swivel body. VERY useful for taking candid, ground, and crowd shots.
* Manual focus implementation is excellent. Focus ring is very smooth.
* Great selection of manual controls
* Relatively fast start-up time
* Burst mode available
* Optical viewfinder as well as the anti-reflective LCD
* My favorite design out of all the digicams in the market
* BEST camera in its price range. THE MOST FIREPOWER IN ITS CLASS.

Some cons:
* A bit large and heavy. Not really a camera for the casual photographer or one that just wants to take snapshots at a party for example. 
* Flash hot-shoe is dummy, still only support for Sony flash units
* Some of the advance and manual features take some time to get used to but well worth it.
* Comes with an almost useless 16mb memory stick. You'll need at least a 128 stick. (I recommend you buy two of them. Also get the sony F707 specific leather carrying case. Nicely built and looks waaay cool.)

Conclusion:

It's obvious Sony listened to fans of the F505-V when creating the F707. They fixed the short comings of the F505-V and even went a few steps further with more features and capabilities. This camera produces brilliantly colored, high resolution photographs with ease. 

The settings and controls on this cam take a little getting used to (as with most manual cams I assume). But if you decide to purchase this cam take the time to learn all the nice features. After seeing the kinds of pics you can take you won't regret it.

I recommend this camera to anyone in love with photography. It's manual settings and functions allow for some spectacular day, night, and indoor photos. If all you are going to use it for is a straight point and shoot cam... save your money. This camera has too much firepower and there are a lot of good point and click cameras that are less expensive.
