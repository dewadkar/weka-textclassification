            Well the 99 Ram Quad Cab 4x4 that is the little sister to my 3500 Quad was bought because my wife needed a 4x4 to feed cows. 
I was a on a job in the Carolinas when I got a call from my wife that our old feed truck was going to require extensive repairs to make another winter, and by the way her car needed new tires. So enthusiastically (as if it were really my idea) I told her to go ahead and kill two birds with one stone...trade her car in on a newer 4x4 pickup. Problem solved...except that the new &quot;feed&quot; truck she bought was an awesome family car! Nope no pasture time for this baby...way too nice and I don't think the cows would appreciate the sound system! This is not your grand dad's old feed truck!
It has enough cab room to live in practically, and will haul anything you can throw in the bed. 
The  Magnum 360v8 has ample power for towing, hauling, squealing the tires when your wife isn't with you, and unfortunately plenty of power to get you to the gas pumps! Best mileage I have received is about 12 mpg on premium, empty, and with a tail wind.

 There have been a few MINOR problems that our dealership service department has taken care of promptly, had they happened out of warranty we probably wouldn't have even had them fixed.

Truck rides like a four wheel drive, the solid front axle gives it a much harsher ride than any IFS 4x4's however that same solid axle gives me a greater sense of well being in situations requiring four wheel drive. The OEM tires are too small! We have replaced the Oem's with a set one size larger and I am extremely happy with their performance, but that is another review.

Hauling, Dodge hit a home run with the availability of tie down areas! Also has pre-molded shelving bracket sorta thingies, lets you divide the bed into sections with well placed and well cut lumber.

This truck is probably not the one for folks who never go off road and only use their 4X4 on snow or iced pavement,the solid front axle gives it a &quot;wagon cart&quot; ride. Which can be a pain in the butt! Especially if you don't really need the four wheel drive!
All in all I rate this truck second...only to my 3500 QC Dodge Diesel!<br><br>
