            Let's face it...most SUV owners love them for the room, the &quot;high up&quot; driving experience and the sporty look, not to mention that they're very trendy and owning one means you belong to the &quot;in&quot; group.  In any event, the Lexus RX300 offers Lexus' unparalled quality, fit and finish, and a sensible design and second-to-none service after the sale (not that you need much.)  Everything is where it should be and you don't have to make many decisions: everything is standard except leather and moon roof (just about).  The sound system is first rate and it's not so big that parking is a chore.  Highly reommended.  Our RX300 was in the same range as a comparably equipped Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer but has more styling and much better quality.  The lease rate for the Ford, believe it or not, was HIGHER than the Lexus, due to a lower residual value.  (This wasn't much of a decision!)  <br><br>
