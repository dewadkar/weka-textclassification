            We had just bought our Chevrolet Tracker two months befor our vacation in Aug. of 1999. Befor we purchasesd out Tracker we were driving a Chevrolet Caviler Z24. We my wife and I go camping we like to have some of the conforts of home with us. We purchased a roof top carrier for the lighter things we were taking. The Tracker handled good with the added weight and the full load inside the car. If there are any draw backs to the tracker thats its a little under powered on long grades even with the power button  turned on. If and when Chevy offers a tracker with an v-6 engine we will probly buy one<br><br>
