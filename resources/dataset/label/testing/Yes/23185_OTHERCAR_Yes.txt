            Although I have always been a Toyota fan and driven Celicas most of my adult life, I seriously researched Toyota Camry and Honda Accord before I made my decision.  My brother has an Accord and recommended it highly.  I read Consumer Reports and every article I could find on both and found that I could get a much better price on the Accord.  The model for the new year was already released and they were anxious to clear out the older ones so it gave me some great bargaining power.  I knew what dealer price was and that there was a dealer incentive out there so I got a really good buy.

Another deciding factor was the head room.  My husband is quite tall and he hit his head on the ceiling of the Camry if he didn't tilt the seat back.  No problem with the Accord.  My only regret is that I didn't go with leather seats.  

I have now had the car for 3 years and have 23,000 miles on it and I have never had one little problem.  Nothing.  No bugs to work out, never had it in for anything besides oil changes and routine checks.  Also, the dealership I went through was great.  I bought it from a Milwaukee dealership 100+ miles from here and did all my bargaining on the phone and when I went to pick it up, they had it in the showroom with balloons on it and when I walked in, the salesman said, &quot;This is Connie.  She is here to pick up her new Accord.&quot;  Everyone clapped and I was shocked.  I was personally introduced to all their sales people, maintenance people and office people (including the owner).  They send me occasional letters to see if I still like my car with special offers, etc., and although I go to a local dealership for my maintenance, I regret that I am not closer because I would prefer to deal with them.<br><br>
