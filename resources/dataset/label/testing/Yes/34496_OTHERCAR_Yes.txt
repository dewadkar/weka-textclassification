            My first test drive I fell in love. The power for a V-6 took my breath away. I previously owned Lincolns (V-8's) and enjoyed the luxury however mechanical problems seemed to always crop up. When looking for a used car I remembered my father having a couple of Buicks so shopping I went. Purchased in 1996 it has been the best car I've ever owned. It has taken many trips from my home in Michigan 1.California 2.Florida (3 times) 3. Arizona 4.Kentucky. I have never been to a repair shop while on the road.
    To date my repairs have consisted of 1. Brake sensor 2. Alternator 3. Battery 4.Transmission cooling line. to me these are regular routine repairs for any used vehicle. My only complaint on a regular basis is the accumulation of brake dust deposits on my font rims ( I've noticed this on many 93 Ultras) I believe it has to do with the front wheel drive. Purchased with 37,000 miles and currently 126,000 I am still in love with it.
