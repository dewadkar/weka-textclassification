            We bought this vehicle about 9 months ago because we needed a car that well frankly, worked. This car was a pleasant surprise in many ways. I loved the digital speedometer it has, that's just a personal plus to me, but also the smooth steering, the roominess, the leather seats, it was and has been a very comfortable ride. 

The gauges for the gas, hot/cold, etc. aren't an eyesore as with most cars, and I like the fact the gas tank hold I believe it's 28 or 29 gallons so I don't have to refill often.

 It's great for long mileage trips or my long drives to work(about 20 miles each way). The only downside is I've noticed that the acceleration is not very fast, it seems to take about 2 to 2 1/2 seconds before it speeds up. But other than that, it is a great car! I would only get this if you had at least 3 people in your family. It's a very roomy car and would go to waste on a one or two person family.<br><br>
