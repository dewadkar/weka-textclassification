            I recently bought a 2000 New Tahoe 2wd LT. This is the best SUV I've purchased. I was set on buying a Ford Expedition 2wd XLT, but what made me decide on this vehicle was the way the vehicle rides. The premium ride suspension makes the vehicle feel just like a car.The acceleration is also very quick. What's really nice is that the Tahoe sits alot higher than the 2wd Expedition. The only thing I've noticed is that my airbag module switch had to be changed 1 month after my purchase. And the following week that light came right back on. I haven't taken the vehicle back to the dealer yet. But overall this is the SUV to get!!!<br><br>
