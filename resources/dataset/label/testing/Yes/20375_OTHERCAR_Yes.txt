             I recently bought a Mazda Tribute in Delray Beach Fl. I love this truck and cant believe the bargain price. The S U V I bought was the DX V6 model with 4 wheel drive. My total price with a 1,600. trade in was 21,000. Hard to believe I was able to buy a quality 4x4 for that price. Im 6'3&quot; and 220 lbs. This truck has plenty of room for me. It has ample space for 5 passengers and decent storage. This 200hp V-6 drives like a sports car. The FM CD stereo sounds fine. After several hundred miles I have found no glitches in this truck. My Tribute is not a mini S U V, although it is priced like one. It is longer than a jeep cherokee and has the storage of a Lexus (info. from the Mazda product guide). I had waited a year for the arrival of the Hyundai Santa Fe. I thought this was my opportunity to buy a neat 4x4 for about 20k. When the Santa Fe arrived , the local dealers wanted 23k for the 4x4 model. Just when I was ready to give up on my dream S U V, I spotted the Tributes on the Mazda lot. Oh neat truck I thought. No doubt a good looking S U V like that will be 24 or 25k I thought When I stopped in and saw the price I was thrilled and the negotiations began. A few painless hours later I was driving my new truck home. Wow what a deal! <br><br>
