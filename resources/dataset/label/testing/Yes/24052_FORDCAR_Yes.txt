            I purchased my Expedition the very first year it became available.  I fell in love with the size, looks, and feel of this utility vehicle. Being in the Aquarium service and custom installation business,  my Expedition became my full time partner.  My work keeps me on the road 80% of the day, going from job site to job site.  Traffic congestion, noise, and road ragers do not affect me in my blue Expedition.  115,000.00 miles later(as of 12/20/99)  It is still going strong.  I only followed the Ford recommended service, replaced a few set of tires, and I ran into a mailbox or two but that is all the maintenance I have done thus far.  I have had many vehicles in my days but I don't plan on giving old blue away any time soon.  I am planning on getting one of those 4-wheel drive crew cab dually for my ever expanding business.  I can only expect that it will last as long as my Expedition.<br><br>
