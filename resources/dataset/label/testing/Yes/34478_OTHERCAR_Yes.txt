            then this is a vehicle you should take a look at.  Their straight forward web site is a great place to start.  It readily provides you all of the information you could possible want on models and classes, including options, what comes standard, and the prices for it all.  All of this without having to enter your personal information, e-mail address or answer questions on when you think you might be ready to purchase. 

After researching, the prices almost seemed too good to be true for all of the extra goodies that came standard, so I was prepared to be a little disappointed when I went to visit the dealership.  What a pleasant surprise!  The dealership was as straight forward as the web site.  As a single woman shopping for a car I have experienced many places where I was talked down to or treated to high pressure tactics.  Not at Daewoo.  The cars, options, and prices were just as represented by the web site, and the sales staff was very helpful when they did not have what I wanted at their lot.   

I ended up with the Leaganza SX and still can not believe what I got for the money, plus it looks great!!  I've been driving it for a month and am still thrilled with the choice I made.  The warranty and road side assistance also help sway me.  I had been looking at Civics and Corollas for about six months, but when I found the Leganza, I new it was time to buy.  They also had a cash back deal and 0.9% financing.  I really feel like I got a great car at a great price. <br><br>
