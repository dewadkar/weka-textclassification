            I have always liked photography.  But I went bananas for this Nikon 950 camera and now I couldn't live without it.  I never could get well focused pictures with my older 35 millimeter camera probably because I wear glasses.  This digital camera provided extremely well focused photos that were professional when printed on my home photosmart printer.  It took me a while to learn all the features and how to use them because the directions were extremely lacking in information.  After I figured out the lighting options, I liked my camera much more.  The only feature that I wish they would fix is that the camera shuts off after a short period of time to save batteries.  What happens is that I am focusing and arranging my subject in the view finder, setting the closeness (like flower) and zooming in.  Then the camera sometimes shuts off and forgets my settings if I am not quick enough to get the picture set up.  I need to redo all my settings again a little faster to get the shot.  The indoor photos sometimes need to be color adjusted with digital photo editing software.

The major mechanical features of this camera a shutter button with a dial for automatic, manual, and play settings.  The play setting is to allow you to play back the pictures you have already taken.  There is a focus button for far away (mountain), close-ups (flower), and timed for taking a picture of yourself.  There is another button for red-eye reduction, or flash settings.  On the back or the camera are two arrow buttons for zooming in and out or paging through the menu.  There is a monitor button to turn the camera back on when it stops to save batteries.  There is another button to show you the menu of computer functions.  On the bottom of the back of the camera are three more buttons.  The trash can button to used to delete a photo if you no-longer want to store it on your flashcard.  A mode button which toggles the photo viewing options from viewing 9 photos at a time or one larger photo by itself.  And there is a quality button that lets you set the image resolution along with the dial on the front of the shutter button.  The camera does attach to a tripod.  I may have left out one or two camera features, but I did my best to cover all of them for you.  More important features of the camera follow. 

This camera uses flash cards instead of film.  They are handy little cards, but expensive.  You can hold 100's of pictures on one of these cards if you buy one with a lot of memory.  The high memory cards cost $200, but there are many levels that you can buy from $20, $40, $90, $100, $200 depending on how many photos you want to store before you download them to your computer.

To download the photos to your computer, you can use a special wire and software that comes with your camera, or you can buy a flashcard drive that looks very much like the mouse you already have.  This is much easier and faster if you use your camera often.  I just plug in the flashcard and use the Browse function with the Paint Shop Pro photo editing software.  I really like Paint Shop Pro for use with these flashcards and this camera.  If you want to use the highest quality setting, which is not necessary, then you will need a more powerful photo editing software like Adobe.  I find that Paint Shop Pro has all the features of Adobe and maybe even more, but has trouble editing high resolution files.  You can do it if you resize to a smaller more reasonable size photo.  Do you need a giant poster right now anyway?  I do, but my printer doesn't print giant posters, so I photograph my subjects using high resolution, but not ultra high resolution. 

My printer prints 8 x 10 photos (HP PHOTOSMART printer 1000) right from the flash card or from the computer.  The photographs even in the mid range resolution are photo quality with extreme quality of colors and image.  I store my photos in plastic sleeves in notebooks to keep them away from any possible water droplets that easily damage my photos.  I am very happy to have so many 8 x 10 pictures in my albums.  I use quality glossy photo paper for printing my photographs.

This camera uses a lot of battery power.  It uses four double A batteries and easily runs them down to no power in one photo session or less.  You really need to use re-chargeable batteries with this camera in order to save the environment and your wallet.

Other features are a computer like menu that allows you to set the camera for professional features.  There are some fancy features like fish eye view that are fun but need a little tweaking by the manufacturer to work really well.  You will need to use the menu to set the lighting.  The camera can be set for sunny day, cloudy day, incandescent, fluorescent lighting or flash.  I have found that for indoor pictures I had more luck setting the camera for cloudy day instead of incandescent lighting.  I also had a lot more luck photographing objects in natural light by a window on a sunny day without the flash than photographing them with the flash.  I use my photo editing software to correct the contrast, saturation, and sometimes the color and sharpen a slightly out of focus image.  The results are really professional looking.  I increase contrast by 15, increase saturation by 15 and sharpen the image twice for excellent results.  On rainy days, I need to take some of the blue out of my pictures.  All this is done quickly and easily with photo editing software.  

If you just take pictures of your family at picnics you should have excellent results without any photo editing.  

Does the camera wear out?  Here are the potential problems with the camera over time.  After nearly two years of use, the rubber cloth like hand grip, which is glued onto the front of the camera came off and would not stick back on.  The little door over the flashcard often doesn't stay latched and hangs down loosely while I am photographing subjects.  These problems do not affect the operation of the camera.  One problem that occurs in some cameras is that the contacts to the batteries become pushed down and no longer make good contact with the batteries.  This can be easily fixed however.  The camera case is extremely durable.  I bought a UV filter for my camera to protect the glass lens from scratching.  I was very glad that I did because I lost the camera case on vacation and had to put the camera in my purse without any other protection for the trip home.     

Overlooking those downfalls, this has been the most useful camera that I have ever owned and it has provided me a new home based business of internet and graphics related photography.  The camera has been a joy to use and my pictures always look professional.  I love this camera and use it almost everyday.
