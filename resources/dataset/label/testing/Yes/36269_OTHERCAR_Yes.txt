            My wife and I bought two (2) of these cars in 1998.  They were both slightly used, mine less used than hers at that time.  She has not put the highway miles on her car as I have.  She now has over 50,000 and I have around 65,000.  Overall, both cars have performed well.  They both have been plagued with a frequent blinking or solid airbag warning light.  We have taken both back to Toyota over and over again.  They've tried replacing the airbags, the circuits, etc.  However, we still have the same issue.  

Other than the airbag light issue, the only other annoying thing in my vehicle, in particular, are noises from paper/dirt that's gotten sucked up into the fan.  Also, I have experienced some vibration noises coming from, most likely, loose plastic behind the dash.  The dealer wants to charge me $40 to look behind the dash and 'fix' it.  However, I'm not sure if it's really worth it.

Both have been excellent cars and drive quite nicely.  I'm a big believer in regularly scheduled maintenance as much as possible.  The 60,000 mile service is a MUST in my book.  There is no timing chain to replace, but a transmission flush (if available) as well as a radiator flush should be done.  The transmission flush, if available, is a nice service and is well-worth the money if you can find a dealer to do it.  It's the most expensive thing to replace if you have a major repair issue in this car.  Just keep the vehicle regularly maintained and shop around at various dealers for the best pricing.

Thanks.
