            I have read the other reviews on here and I have just bought my first Hyundai Tiburon this summer.  So, I guess that means I should write my review too.

I bought my Tibby VERY cheap, I mean VERY.  I saw it driving past a local "junk yard."  The moment I saw it, I wanted it.  I, along with my auto mechanic father, went to go look at it.  They were selling it for only $5,000 (yes, that is the actual price...it's not a typo).  The only thing wrong with it was the undercarriage which my father fixed in less than a month of working on it 2-3 days out of the week.  The only things I had to buy were new tires and a new fan shroud.  Otherwise, it was like a brand new car.  People I know have NO idea that my car was a salvage because it looks so good (no dents, no scratches).

What can I say about my car?  I LOVE IT!!  It handles very well in ANY type of weather.  This winter is my first time driving it in snow and I have had NO problems with it so far (knock on wood).  I have never gotten stuck (even when the snow is up to the bumper) and I have never slid out of control, even with no anti-lock brakes.

I don't think the front seats are cramped because it is usually just me driving.  In fact, I find the front seat very comfortable.  But my sister and friends have sat in the back and it was very tight fitting.

I like the design of the front dash.  It looks a little like an airplane cockpit to me (yeah, I know I'm a loser).  The radio and tape deck work well.  I would like to get a CD/radio but so far, my portable CD with a car kit works just as well!  The speakers are good but I'd like a little more bass, then it would be perfect.

All in all, my Tiburon is a dang good car considering the fact that I only payed $5,000 for a $13,000 car (according to http://www.kbb.com).
