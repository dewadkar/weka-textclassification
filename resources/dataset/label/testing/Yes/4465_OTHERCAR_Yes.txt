            I bought my Volkswagen Cabrio in November of 1999. This is the best car I have ever owned.  I have been through many vehicles but the Cabrio offers everything I wanted.  The convertible top is wonderful on a nice spring/summer/fall day.  The drive is incredibly smooth and the feature I was most surprised about is the trunk space.  I pack a lot when I go on vacation and the trunk is much bigger than I expected.  It is also great on gas.  It's a very comfortable vehicle.  I also get a lower price on insurance due to the Cabrio having the roll bar on top.  Other convertibles do not have this and my auto insurance would be much more.  I definitely recommend the Cabrio for women, it's definitely a girls car.  There is nothing I don't like about my car.   <br><br>
