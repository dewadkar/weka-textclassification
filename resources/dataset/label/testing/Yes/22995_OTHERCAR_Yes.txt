            I have been wanting to buy a digital camera for a while.  I am not a photographer by profession or even by hobby, but I really need a digital camera for taking pictures and uploading them to the web.  Since I am not a big fan of photography I don't plan to spend more than $200.  I decided on the Polaroid PDCC640 for the following reasons: the Polaroid name, its features (especially self-timer), and the fact that the box came with everything.  I expected to be taking and uploading photos within the hour, and was not disappointed.

The Polaroid PDC640 is not the cheapest digital camera around.  I got it for $149.00 at Walmart. But in comparison to the other models they had on display, it seemed to offer the best deal. There are cheaper cameras, but most of those don't even have LCD screens (the display panel at the back of the camera from which you can preview pictures).  

As I said, the PhotoMax comes boxed as a complete, ready-to-go kit.  The kit includes the PhotoMax Flash 640 digital camera, Polaroid PhotoMax Image Maker Software, 4 AA batteries, an AC Adapter, a pair of camera-to-computer cables (USB and serial), wrist strap, and instructions. 

The following is the specification for the camera: it has a 640 X 480 pixel       resolution and 320 X 249 pixel resolution, 1.8" color LCD display monitor, 7.0 mm, f 3.0 lens, focal range of 20" to infinity, an automatic exposure system, automatic self timer, 2MB internal memory, Image storage of 15 pictures in the 640 X 480 resolution and 50 pictures in the 320 X 249
mode, Autoflash, flash, and flash-off modes, JPEG compression, RS-232 serial download, automatic power saving mode, 4 AA batteries, tripod mountable.

The system requirements for use of the software are a Pentium Class PC, Windows 95 or 98, 32 MB RAM, 85 MB available hard drive space, available COMM port, high color (16-bit) display settings at 800 X 600 pixels                recommended, 2X or faster CD-ROM drive, color monitor, mouse, and a sound card.  The image formats that this camera/software supports are        BMP, TIFF, JPEG, PCX, TGA, PCD (read-only).

All of these sound pretty intimidating, but as I said I was able to upload pictures to the internet within the hour.  The software is easy to install and use, and the menu options on the camera intuitive and clear.  The instruction manuals are also excellent.  This is among the most idiot-proof piece of hardware I have ever purchased.

The Polaroid PDC640 offers all the basic bells and whistles found in any digital camera.  The reason that it can be made so cheaply is that all the electronics belong to the most affordable options, and the lens and other parts associated with traditional cameras are also made with the cheapest material out there.  So, basically, what you have here is the digital equivalent of the cheap dummy cameras made by Vivitar.  It won't give you the prettiest pictures, it doesn't even have the best lens for this type of camera, but in my opinion it offers the most well-rounded set of features for a camera in this price range.  This is absolutely the best choice for a beginner who did not want to spend a fortune.
