            I purchased my 1992 Acura Legend approximately 4.5 years ago used. I bought this car, because at the time I had a red 240sx nissan sports coupe and wanted something larger. I was growing out of that kiddie stage and wanted a family car even though I was single; I still had a taste for more room. I was looking for something with class which would fit my personality along with my purse. I went to the lot and I saw my &quot;car&quot; and that was it. 

No matter where I went or what salesmen tried to sell me, it just would not work. I wanted that car (acura legend). I talked to my brother-in-law, who is a mechanic, and he told me that I would be making a great investment by purchasing the legend. He told me that the legend was a long lasting car and a high quality vehicle. 

I had decided I wanted a luxury vehicle, but did not understand the concept of what I was actually getting. I can honestly say that I have not had any trouble at of my car; I change the timing belt for the first time about 6 months ago. Not because it gave me warning, but because a trust friend told me due to the number of miles on it that it was probably time. 

Before purchasing the car, I called the previous owner. He was a doctor from Brookhaven and a very nice gentleman. I called him at his office and he gave me any and all information that I was looking for. I first asked him if he had had any trouble out of the vehicle. He stated that he had not and would not have traded it if his wife did not decide she wanted a newer one. He stated that he had bought the car new and he had gotten every dime that he had paid for it, out of it. I asked what type of work had been down on it the car. He stated the routine oil changes and that was it. 

Again, this car has been a jem to me. It has serviced me well, my husband wants me to get another family vehicle and he wants to keep my car. No, way! I could not afford the Legend if I had to buy it new, but no one could go wrong buying it used. People that see it always inquire about buying it, but the answer remains the same. NO!<br><br>
