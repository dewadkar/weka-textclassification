            Why I Bought the Product:

  There were four reasons why I bought the Nikon Coolpix 990 digital
  camera:
  
    1. Pictures from digital cameras are a lot better than scanned prints.
       Scanners tend to pick up a lot of &quot;dust&quot; at higher resolutions and        often have a bias toward a part of the color spectrum.

    2. I had wanted to use digital pictures in making my own cards and
       presentations.

    3. It was one of the first 3 Megapixel cameras on the market.

    4. It is made by one of the most respected camera/optics manufacturer
       in the world.


Experience Using the Camera:

    I had bought the digital camera in May, shortly after it appeared on      the US market.  The controls are similar to point and shoot cameras,
    yet it also has features found in more sophisticated SLRs.  And, the 
    pictures that it takes are fantastic!

    I've taken pictures in bright light, low light, bulb mode, fully 
    automatic, aperture priority, shutter priority and fully-manual
    modes, and the camera has yet to disappoint me!

    As with any camera, the more you know about the camera and
    about general photography, the better the pictures you will take.
    The menus are intuitive but lengthy.  I would have preferred a couple
    more buttons to having to go through three or four layers of menus 
    to turn on/off a feature such as using the fluorescent setting under 
    White Balancing.  However, the pictures are stunning and the 
    resolution is great for work on computers.  A XGA shot (about a 2
    MPixel shot) is enough to make a background without &quot;stretching&quot;
    at 1024x768.

    However, the greatest cons going against it are endemic to nearly 
    all digital cameras on the market.  It eats batteries, so invest in 
    a couple sets of NiMH (nickel metal hydride) rechargeable batteries.
    They're pricey, but they work better than alkalines.  Each charge is
    good for about 30-60 minutes of usage.  In addition, 3.3 Mpixels are
    great for the computer screen but not very good for printing out.
    For example, at 3 Mpixels (2000x1500), the camera will only generate a
    picture about 6inx5in at 300dpi (not to mention a 10Mb file).
    Granted, most printers aren't capable of printing photo-quality 
    stuff, but this is just to show, that at this point, film is still
    better for hardcopies.  For this reason, I carry both my digital 
    camera and my SLR when going to events/trips.


  Pros:
    The camera's greatest strength is the amount of features that Nikon 
    has packed into such a small package!  For the traditional point and 
    shoot users, the camera will be breeze; push the button halfway
    and the camera determines the aperture and shutter speed for a 
    properly exposed shot.  Matrix metering helps to correctly expose
    hard to judge situations such as landscapes (dark ground, bright sky)
    and subjects that are in shadows.

    For those that would like more control over the picture, it allows you
    to shoot in aperture priority, shutter speed priority or fully
    manual.  It also has exposure compensation (+-2ev) and a bulb feature
    (useful for shooting fireworks or around campfires).  The white 
    balance feature was useful when shooting under fluorescent lighting
    since it automatically compensates to remove the yellowish tinge that
    one would otherwise get.


  Cons:
    My greatest complaint against the Nikon Coolpix 990 is how quickly it
    will go through batteries.  The batteries that were packaged with the
    camera didn't even last 30 pictures.  The manual suggests turning off
    the LCD display and having it focus only when the trigger is pushed 
    halfway (manual mode only) to extend the battery life.  However, it 
    is very hard not to use the LCD when lighting conditions are difficult
    and when converters are attached to the camera.  The best solution 
    that I found for this problem was buying 2 sets of NiMH rechargeable
    batteries.  They were expensive (4 for $16), but they'll save you 
    money in the long run since four alkaline batteries only last about 
    30 shots, and they're not as restrictive as AC-adapters.

    My second pet-peeve about the camera is that it's not a SLR.  Because
    the viewfinder is not through the lens (TTL), the picture you see 
    through the viewfinder may not be what's actually been taken.  There 
    are marks for when you take close-ups or regular shots, but they're 
    not very accurate.  If you do use the viewfinder, make sure that the
    subject of interest is not at the edge of the shot.  As a result, I
    almost exclusively use the LCD panel and not the viewfinder.
    Another consequence with not having TTL viewfinder is that converters
    should be used in non-flash situations only or else, the metering
    may be fooled.<br><br>
