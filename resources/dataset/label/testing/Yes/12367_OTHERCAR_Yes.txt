            Prior to this automobile I had leased an Infiniti J30, which is easily one of the most comfortable, stylish, and attractive luxury cars on the market.  Of course, at over $40,000+ brand new, the J30 should be.  

Due to the amount of travelling I do with my work, I decided to purchase an almost brand new (one year old) sedan, and decided on the Mercury Sable-- a slightly upscale version of the newly remodeled Ford Taurus.  I have to admit, I was really enamored by its oval, jelly-bean shape, with rounded corners and smooth edges.  I had difficulty, in principle,  stepping down from an Infiniti to a Mercury, but was impressed instantly with its exterior appearance, high-tech control panel, and overall roominess.  

Now that I have owned the Mercury Sable four-door sedan for over 2 years, I am ecstatic over how trouble-free the automobile is.  I am still driving its original tires, with almost 70,000 miles on the odometer, and have yet to replace the battery or the brakes.  Outside of routine maintenance, the car has performed exemplary, with no major engine troubles, knocks, pings, or inconveniences associated with a used vehicle.

The ride is comfortable, with plenty of room for the entire family, and a deceptively huge trunk, that holds its own against any small pick-up truck on the market.  Friends are amazed at how much I can put into the trunk, as I often respond to their &quot;that will never fit in the trunk&quot; comments, with a very smug, &quot;Well, you just watch this...&quot;  If you're in the market for a sports utility vehicle because of the added storage space, you may wish to check out this family-friendly sedan instead.

And how does the ride compare to the luxury Infiniti J30?  Well, I was amazed at how smooth and effortlessly it hugs the road.  The Sable handles corners well, and its top-of-the-line stereo and CD system is very comparable to Infiniti's Bose set-up, which makes driving in rush-hour commute traffic easy on the tension level.

The only negatives about the Mercury Sable I can think of, are:  a)  the exterior crunches easily if you're in an accident (I was in a small fender-bender that barely bruised the other car, but my damage totaled over $5,000), and b) the windows are a little less sound-proof than my comparison luxury car.

All in all, the Mercury Sable is mechanically trouble-free, roomy, comfortable, and fun to drive.  Now that's luxury we can all afford!
