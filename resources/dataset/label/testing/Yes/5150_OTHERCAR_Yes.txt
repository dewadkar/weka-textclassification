            I have a 1994 Dodge Dakota. Its black. I have the towing package, racing headers(illegal), racing cams, racing valves, a Gibson three inch muffler system, the racing computer and chip, several other engine mods, and Michelin LTX tires. I also put in a Custom bed liner and a fiberglass cover for the bed. With a V8 and the rest of my choice options this car is a rocket. I personally have driven this beauty at 143 miles per hour, or so said the ticket. I have a bench, which isn't bad, but the one with bucket seats is better. The extended cab ruins the car if your ask me. It handles great and the ride isn't bad at all. If you can get your hands on one of these trucks with a V8, buy it. P.S. She handles great in the snow.<br><br>
