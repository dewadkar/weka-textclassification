            Just picked up a 2001 Toyota Camry Solara SLE V6.  I got the hardtop, not the convertible.  What a wonderful car.  I love driving in it.  If you're looking for more of a sports car you might be a bit disappointed.  But, if you're looking for a nice mix of sports and luxury, you'll fall in love with this car.<p>
Whatever you do though, buy the V6 version and not the 4-cylinder.  The 200-hp in the V6 gives the car a good peppy feel and is fun to drive on the highways (giving enough power for the car to easily pass on the highway without effort).<p>
The sound system in the car is well worth mentioning.  It's a 200-watt JBL system with an in-dash 6-CD changer and it's loud enough to fill in that quiet void -- the quiet void that is left from the great noise dampening put together for this car.  This car is one of the quietest rides I've ever ridden in.<p>
What's more, there is a lot of interior room for a coupe.  I can fit four full-sized guys (like me 6'3") in the car comfortable.  The car interior is huge and so is the trunk.<p>
Features are abound in the car:  ABS, driver+passenger airbags, side airbags, moonroof, leather, etc.  A lot of it comes standard.  Though keep in mind that if you want the traction control, you'll have to step up and buy the SLE version of the car.  I got the SLE but opted not to get the traction control.<p>
Compared to my 1991 V6 Camry SE the Solara provides a nice ride that has stiffer suspension and a preppier engine.  And you just can't beat Toyota reliability.  The 1991 Camry that I used to drive has had no major problems and still runs fine today.  I'm betting my money that my new Solara will have the same reliability.<p>
Minor complaints about the car deal with only two things.  First, the trunk opening is a bit odd -- the trunk is large, but the way the trunk opening is shaped means that you'll be able to get lots of small stuff in there, but nothing big.This also goes for the strange smaller opening to the trunk from the fold down back seats.  I'm sure the smaller opening for the backseats is due to the strengthening that Toyota put into the car between the passenger cabin and the trunk in order to provide a stiffer body.<p>
The other minor complaint is that passengers in the backseat getting in via the driver's side will have a tough time.  The passenger side seat folds down and slides forward offering easy access to the backseats, the driver's side seat only folds down and makes it quite difficult to get into the backseats.<p>
The air conditioning in the car is good, cools down the cabin rather quickly.  The glove compartment is spacious, though the arm rest storage is a bit on the small side.  There are four cup holders provided with the car (two for the front passengers and two for the rear).<p>
Toyota has put in those small special touches that make the car that much more luxurious.  An example of this is the faux wood grain trim around the front cabin that makes the car so much more sophisticated.  I would compare the Solara to a Lexus.  It has all the stylings inside (especially how the center console looks) and even the performance under the hood.<p>
The only thing missing that doesn't make the Solara a Lexus is the big price tag.  Though not a inexpensive car, the Solara lets buyers purchase a good vehicle with the trimmings of a more expensive one for less money.  Keep in mind that Solaras come out of the Canadian Toyota plant and that's where all of them come out of.  That same plant is officially approved to also produce Lexus cars and the Solara feels that way with its tight construction.<p>
All-in-all I would not hesitate to recommend the Solara to potential purchasers, I just want to recommend that they get the V6 version to fully enjoy this vehicle.
