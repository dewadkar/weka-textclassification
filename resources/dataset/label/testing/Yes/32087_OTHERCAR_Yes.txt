            After doing a lot of research including reading many reviews on epinions I finally decided to plunk down the money on a 2002 325i.

Being on somewhat of a budget if one can be when shopping for a car of this caliber, I opted for a base 325i with the automatic steptronic (which is way cool), a sunroof and heated seats. I did not order it this way but my dealership seamed to stock a few like this just for buyers like me. My 325i is Jet Black with the tan Leatherette and that awesome titanium bar running along the dash. 

My dealer ship experience was great. My sales consultant was very patient as I worked with him over several weeks deciding if I was going to go with a certified pre-owned 5 series or a new 3 series. I really liked the room the 5 series offered but I could not find one with lower miles in the price range I wanted. 

After the deal was done the manager came over to congratulate me, and he and my sales consultant took me on a tour of the dealership and introduced me to all the relevant staff I would need to know if I ever needed anything.

Pros of the car:

The first thing I fell in love with was the acceleration. Even with the 2.5 liter engine and the automatic, this car still feels really quick. It hugs the road and gives me the confidence to let it out as I feel the urge. Sometimes I just leave the radio off and listen to the engine. Sweet music!

The interior is awesome. I like how everything is laid out. It did not take me long to get the sense of where everything was. There is enough room for my kids in the back. Both are in booster car seats and they have not complained about room. 

The exterior is equally great. Obviously the car attracts looks. But what I love is the way the car has a flawless fit and the paint is like glass. The sound of the door shutting is priceless. The trunk is big enough, not huge but there is room for my golf bag and groceries if needed.

The cons of the car:

My only complaints are of the seats, radio reception and the lack of a standard arm rest.

I have the standard leatherette seats with the manual adjustments. (Just for reference I am 6' 1" and @ 200lbs) Overall the seat is pretty good but it lacks support under the thighs. I wish they tilted up/back for more support. Over long drives this could be a problem.  Next time I will opt for the sport or power seats that offer more support.

Next, as I finally started to use the radio after enjoying the engine music for a week, I noticed poor reception of AM stations as I listed to my favorite sports talk in the afternoon. My previous cars had perfect AM reception, so I know it is not the area I live in. I called the service dept at my dealer and was told very cautiously that this is a problem with the new 3 series most likely because of the antenna being in the rear window versus a stand-up exterior model. He is currently investigating if there is a way to install an exterior antenna for me. Otherwise the standard sound system is fine for my needs.

My last complaint is about the lack of a standard armrest. One would think an armrest would come standard on a BMW. I realized this option was a must form me the minute I sat in my car in the showroom. I just looked at my sales consultant and he told me he would have one installed if I wanted one. I am glad I did because I had to drive the car for 3 days waiting for the part to come in and I struggled to find a comfortable driving position. After it was installed, it was like ahhh..   I heard that the 2003's will come with a standard armrest.

So overall I love the car, and feel like I will be a BMW owner for life.
