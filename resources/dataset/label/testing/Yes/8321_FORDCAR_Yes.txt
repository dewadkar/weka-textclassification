            Try to beat me off the line, I dare you.  Well I guess there are some cars that can but I don't run into a whole lot of them.

When I first learned that my wife had bought a car without consulting me I was mortified.  On top of that I was told that she had bought the only car on the lot that was offered as the free car which was to be given away had anybody been refused credit.  (promotion)  Luckily she had insisted upon a warranty which insured no problems for 3,000 miles.  The car had transmission and brake problems which were fixed free of charged thanks to this warranty.  Afterwards she was driving like a dream.

I have been driving this car for about a year and I have been very pleased since the repairs.  I am nearing the 100,000 mile mark and I am still beating everyone off of the line.  Traffic jams on the freeway are no problem.  As soon as a gap appears I switch the overdrive off for a few seconds to get my rpms up and then switch back.  No problem.  I put all the slow drivers behind me.

The back seat is a little small, but I have seen a lot smaller.  The bucket seats are quite comfortable and the aerodynamic shape probably saves me a bit on gas.  I am surprisingly averaging between 30-36 miles to the gallon.  My air conditioning is a bit shoddy but that is probably not typical of most cars, most likely it is the 7 years of use that has worn it out before I ever saw it.

If you are on the market for a used car and want one that is somewhat sporty and fast, look into this one, but make sure it has been properly maintained.
