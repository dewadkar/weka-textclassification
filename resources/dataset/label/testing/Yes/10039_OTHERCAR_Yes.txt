            We traded in our clunky, unreliable Ford Escort for a 2000 Kia Sephia and couldn't be happier. We love our Kia! It handles as well as any car we have ever driven.  We also have a Nissan Quest, but our Kia is now our driving preference!  
   I would recommend the Kia for anyone looking for an inexpensive, yet extremely reliable car.  It makes a great first, second or third car.
  We had done research with many places before deciding upon Kia.  It took us 2 years to decide on a Quest, yet only 2 months to buy a Kia.
   You will not be sorry with your Kia purchase.  There is not one thing I don't like on my Kia. It has great trunk space, head room, leg room and drives great!

Once you read my new edited commments, you will realize that I was in the &quot;honeymoon stage&quot; with our new Kia. Now after a few months of owning our Kia, I have found numerous things that bother me.  One thing that drives me absolutely nuts is that the wipers make this clicking noise when they are on a slower speed. I can't tell you if this is with all Kias, but it is like this on mine.  The only way to alleviate this problem is by placing your wipers on high speed. Nothing better when it is slightly raining, than to have your windshield wipers on high speed! 
  I also find that my Kia does not corner well on the old country roads I travel.  My Dh disagrees with me on this and says that I just don;t know how to control the car at higher speeds. I have never had a problem with driving my Nissan Quest on those country roads though!
  I can tell you that the Kia Sephia is not made for these Maine winters.  We have had to take out our hair dryer and extension cord atleast three times this winter. Why is this???  Our driver door freezes and will not close! Talk about a safety issue.  
   I must tell you that these are individual problems that I have noticed, I am not saying that all Kias are like this.  I would be interested in hearing from other Sephia owners to see if they have had similar problems. Overall, our Kia is a great car, even with all the problems. <br><br>
