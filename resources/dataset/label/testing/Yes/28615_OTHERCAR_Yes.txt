            I recently went shopping for a digital camera as a gift for my cousin.  Before I purchased the Fuji Finepix A101, I bought an Olympus D370 and found its photos blurry and color reproduction completely unacceptable.  

After returning the D370, I found the A101 on sale at a local retailer and purchased it. I simply could not believe how clear the photos were from this relatively inexpensive camera, and it's color reproduction was wonderful.  

The A101 is very simple to operate, something I was looking for since this would be my cousin's first digital camera.  The camera is on when you open the lens cover and off when you close it.  How easy is that?  The LCD display works very well and the camera's menu is not at all complicated.  There is no need to wait for the camera to focus this is truly point and shoot. The included 8MB Smartmedia card was a pleasant surprise.  This camera, as many other digital cameras, does "eat" batteries quickly.  Two AA batteries are included.  A couple of sets of rechargable batteries would make a good investment.  

I must admit that I did not test the included software as you do not need it with Windows XP.  I simply connected camera to the computer with the included USB cable, downloaded the photos to the PC and used software we already had to enhance, resize and print the photos.   

This camera makes a great first digital camera for kids or anyone who currently uses a point and shoot 35mm camera.  There is no optical zoom so people whom are accustom to more expensive film cameras may not like it.
