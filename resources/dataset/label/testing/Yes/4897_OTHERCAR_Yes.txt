            When shopping for a new digital camera, I was looking for the following options:

<b>1.</b> Battery life
<b>2.</b> Small size
<b>3.</b> High resolution
<b>4.</b> Auto lens cover

After having a large digital camera with a manual lens cap and terrible battery life � I wanted the exact opposite this time.  I decided to go from a 2mp to a 3mp camera, and I already knew Sony�s infolithium battery was great because I have a Sony camcorder that uses it.  That�s when I decided on a Sony.  Then, I wanted an auto lens cover, because the manual ones are such a pain.  You can lose a manual lens cover � or if you have it attached to the camera, it hangs there in the way all the time.  And if you don�t put it right back on when not taking pictures, your lens is exposed and unprotected unnecessarily.  That really cuts down the choices!  I didn�t know how few cameras had this feature.  Size and appearance was important, and although I didn�t need one as tiny as the DSC-P1, it�s really cute!

The Sony DSC-P1 is a 3.3 mega pixel digital camera with a 3X optical zoom, which stores photos on sony�s own �memory stick�.   The camera is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse, making it very easy to bring it with you everywhere you go.  It has digital zoom as well, but since digital zoom cuts down on photo quality, I choose not to use it.  

You can view the photos taken with this camera in the following ways: 

<b>1.</b> On the camera's 1.5 inch LCD 

<b>2.</b> On your TV using the TV/video connection  - This is really cool, once you hook up your camera, you can then see everything the LCD would diplay right on your TV.  This includes reviewing photos taken (you can set it to slideshow so you don�t have to manually scroll through photos) and taking live photos!  Of course you�re limited to the short length of the AV cable, but if you want to take some pictures around the TV, you can see exactly what you�re taking on your television as you�re taking it!  

<b>3.</b> On your computer - you can get your pictures onto your computer by connecting the camera to your computer�s USB port which then acts just like an external drive, allowing you to quickly move pictures to your hard drive using windows explore.  This requires first installing the camera�s driver with the included software CD.  Sony specifically states that YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE DRIVER BEFORE CONNECTING YOUR CAMERA TO THE USB.  I read that not doing that can cause problems, so be sure to install the driver before connecting your camera for the first time.   Sony sells a variation of �memory card� readers you can purchase separately.  Which include a floppy disk adapter about $80 � but good if you don�t have USB and requires no software,  a �memory card� reader & a �memory card� mouse which is a fully functional optical mouse with a �memory card� slot.  The mouse requires USB and costs about $80

<b>QUALITY:</b> 

With a maximum resolution of 3.3 mega pixels, the quality of the photos taken with this camera are pretty good. You get 5 size choices, 2048x1536, 2048(3:2), 1600x1200, 1280x960 and 640x480.  The higher the resolution the more space the photo will take on the memory stick. 

However, I did notice some of the same things other people complain about in their opinions.  

<i>The shadow effect:</i> A shadow is cast to the left of the subjects due to the positioning of the flash.  It�s too far to the left of the lens so when you use the flash, you often capture a shadow.  

<i>Flash:</i> The flash is either weak or too extreme.  You have 3 flash settings � low/normal/high.  No matter what setting, if you are indoors and the subject is farther than 6 feet away, the photo may turn out dark.  Similarly, if you take close shots and use the flash, the subject is too lit up.  There are different modes you can try in combination with flash levels.  These modes are: Twilight mode: Suppresses the washed-out color of a bright subject in a dark place so you can record the subject without losing the dark atmosphere of the surroundings � and Twilight plus mode: Increases the effectiveness of the twilight mode � I noticed these settings drastically change the lighting of your photograph.  


<b>FEATURES:</b> 

<b>Self Timer:</b> Allows you to set the camera to delay taking the picture for 10 seconds so you can run in and be in it. 

<b>Movie mode:</b> Allows you to record a short mpeg movie � 5, 10 or 15 seconds with a few quality selections.  This is a really cool feature � but make sure the lighting is pretty good when shooting these.  It has a microphone to record sound, and a speaker so you can hear it during playback!  

<b>Clip Motion:</b> Clip Motion is where you take a bunch of photographs(2-10)and piece them together to create motion. It's really easy to do, you just select clip motion and proceed to take your pictures...the camera puts them together and when in playback mode you get to see it in motion. These are great for websites because it creates an animated .GIF file.  I found this feature really fun.

<b>Voice:</b> Setting the voice will allow you to record the sound that accompanies the still photo.  When you press & release the shutter to take the photo, the sound is recorded for 5 seconds.   Or you can hold down the shutter button and record sound for up to 40 seconds.  

<b>Macro:</b> Used for shooting extreme close ups

<b>Automatic lens cover:</b> I like this a lot because you don�t have to have a separate lens cover that you manually have to keep putting on and taking off � this camera has it built in.  When it�s closed, the camera is virtually flat so you can throw it in your pocket � no lens cap to worry about!

<b>Battery Life:</b> 

The DSC-P1 uses Sony�s Infolithim battery.  The battery life is great, you get up to 90 minutes depending on how much you use the LCD, zoom and other factors.  The battery recharges right in the camera itself with the included AC adapter � so you aren�t always fidgeting around with the battery.  Also, it tells you in minutes how much battery life is left.  This number changes when in different modes (play/still/movie), I think because different actions take different amounts of battery power, so it�s telling you how much time you have left for doing what you are currently doing.  People still complain about battery life, but digital cameras take a lot of power to run � and I think infolithium is the best there is right now.  

<b>Appearance:</b> 

This camera is very small, it is the 2nd smallest 3 mp digital camera (canon having the smallest models) and it�s very cool looking.  It�s silver metal body and small size make it an eye catching camera.  It�s very solid too � nothing about it feels cheap.  The buttons are placed very well, and feel natural to use.  And although it�s small, it feels very comfortable to hold onto.    The 1.5� LCD display is very bright and clear.  The camera is very easy to use, menus are easy to access and maneuver through.  When reviewing photos you can zoom in and move around to see more detail. 

<b>THE CAMERA COMES WITH:</b>

1 infolithium battery
1 8mb memory stick
AC adapter (used to power camera AND as battery charger)
AV cables (for TV hookup)
USB cable
Software CD  � which includes the driver, MGI photosuite & MGI videowave (for the mpeg�s)
Instruction manual

The memory is an issue too, if you want to take a lot of pictures at high quality, you�re going to need to purchase another memory stick.  They come in 4,8,16,32,64 and just released 128mb � costing just under $2 per mb depending on where you shop.  So just add that to the cost of the camera.  Sure, it would be nice if they gave you more than 8mb of memory with the camera � but they don�t�.so just use the included 8mb memory stick as a backup.  I bought the case for this camera, and it has a place to store any extra memory sticks.  Lots of people are against Sony creating it�s own memory storage�.especially now that IBM has created the microdrive which can be used in compatible cameras that take compact flash type I & II cards � the microdrive has high storage up to 1GB!  I don�t especially like memory stick, but battery life was the #1 important feature to me, so I�ll live with the memory stick.  If storage capacity is the most important thing to you, then I would suggest getting a camera that takes IBM microdrive.  

At 699.99, this is an expensive camera � you can get it online as low as around $580.00, maybe even lower � and prices will continue to go down.  There are similar models � also very small � the Sony DSC-P30 � 1.3mp, and the DSC-P50 � 2.1mp.  These are both about the same size as the DSC-P1, but with 2 very important differences.  They don�t have an auto lens cover and they use AA batteries.  I consider battery life very important, and after an bad experience with a digital camera that used rechargeable AA batteries, I really enjoy the infolithium battery life. The bigger cameras have better flash & a little better overall photo quality, so you are giving something up for the small size, but overall I think it's a great camera.
