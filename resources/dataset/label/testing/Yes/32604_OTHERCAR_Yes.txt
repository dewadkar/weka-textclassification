            Until about 5 months ago, I helped to pay my way in college by selling used cars. At the lot I worked at, we featured pre-owned late-model cars and trucks. I have always enjoyed driving.

I was lucky, however to work at a lot where I got to drive relatively new cars all of the time. Let me explain. The guy I worked for was an extremely honest fellow who genuinely cared about his customers. One of his ideals was that he wouldn't just stick a car out on the lot. Instead, he would assign it to one of his salesman to drive for a week "just to make sure it ain't a lemon or broked down or somethin' like that." OK. What this meant for me was that I got to drive all sorts of relatively-new cars. For free. Unfortunately, many of these cars were the mundane family sedan. Well, I already had a '90 Buick LeSabre, so I found little enjoyment from  driving them. Then, a strange object showed up on the lot: a Subaru Legacy.

When my boss tossed me the keys, I was expecting just another mundane sedan. When I saw it, however, the garish chrome wheels, Hood scoop and rear spoiler told me that this wasn't another mundane sedan. I don't think this style would appeal to everybody, but I liked it. It gave the car a very nimble and tossable look. All the body panels were screwed on tight, with no gaping gaps, a la GM. The only thing I didn't like about the exterior was the Maytag-white exterior color.

This model was a Legacy GT Limited. This meant that this car came fully loaded. The seats were very supportive, with obvious emphasis on sporty drivivng. There were splashes of wood by the power window controls and the gearshift. The first thing I noticed, however, were the old-style sliding adjustments for the climate-control, as opposed to knobs. This gave the interior a cheap look. The Subaru had all power features, an automatic transmission, and, of course, 4-wheel drive. The sound quality of the radio was average, but the stereo controls were small and hard to use.

The interior components and materials were of high-quality, with typical Japanese workmanship. The size of the interior was smaller then its competitors, however.

The Subaru's best trait is its terrific handling. This thing reminded me of a go-kart. Fade-free brakes and full-time 4-wheel drive made the handling of this sedan one of the best packages I have ever drove. Unfortunately, this car is slowed down by its slow engine. Making 165 HP, it doesn't go very fast.

I encourage anyone who enjoys driving, doesn't need a huge amount of space, and would like to drive something distinctive at a good price to check out a Subaru Legacy.
