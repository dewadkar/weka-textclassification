            Overall, the Dodge Neon is a good car for the money you spend.  You get decent gas mileage - last time I checked, I got 27 mpg.  It has a roomier interior than what it looks like from the outside.  It does sit rather low, so, an older person or someone with aches & pains may have a little difficulty getting in and out of it.  I do not like the way the doors are shaped.  The front especially, because it comes to a point right near eye level.  I know one of these times when I am in a hurry, I am going to hit the corner of that door and it is going to really hurt!  If you have to use your brakes a lot in traffic, the anti-lock brakes makes a loud noise - reminds me of air brakes on a truck.  It might not be that loud from the outside, but, from the inside, it sounds awful.  But, then again, it might just be me not used to anti-lock brakes since I never had them on any of my other vehicles.  I was told not to "pump" the brakes, which usually eliminates the noise of the brakes.   When you sit inside the Neon, you cannot see the hood of the car.  That took quite a while to get used to because it is kind of hard to judge when you are trying to parallel park.  It has child safety features standard - like car seat hooks in the back and child safety door locks that you can switch so that they only open from the outside, so, that the kids cannot open the doors and fall out.  But, for the most part, I really like my Neon.  It is just a few things that I am not used to that drive me crazy, like those anti-lock brakes!
