            I own a 1996 Mazda B-4000 SE and it is the perfect vehicle for us. The extended cab allows good storage for a truck and seatbelts for 5 if needed. The truck has plenty of ground clearance and is pretty solidly built. I live in an area where there are heavily rutted roads and 4wd is a necessity some of the time. This is the perfect truck for that. It has a stiff suspension so the ride tends to be a little rough but it is a truck and is supposed to do this. On the highway it's a very smooth comfortable ride. The back seats in the king cab are cozy at best but are fine for my 2 small children. The driver's side air bag cannot be turned off but on the newer models they can be. The gas mileage is around 20mph. The good thing about the stiffer ride is that it forces me to drive a little slower which isn't such a bad thing.


SUMMARY: A very good small truck that has alot of power and seems very well built and sturdy.<br><br>
