            Enough people have written about the benefits (and disadvantages!) of the Coolpix 990.  Before saying anything else I should say that I am a (semi)serious amateur photographer rather than a professional, I mostly take landscapes (that are still) rather than people (who usually aren't), and that I've also had 35mm, four different medium format cameras, and a Nikon Coolpix 900.

What I wanted to answer is: is the CP990 a good travelling camera?  I think it is, and it is for many of the same reasons that *any* digital camera is a good travelling camera!

I recently bought and took my CP990 on a five week trip from Australia (where I live) to Greece and the UK.  Two weeks in conference for my work and three weeks touring.  In all, I took 2500 pictures without feeling like I was clicking all the time.  You may feel that's strange since it averages over 100 pictures per day while travelling and relaxing, and I too was surprised that I only felt 'snap happy' once or twice.  So one of the benefits of the CP990 is: many photos...

Of course, taking 100 pictures per day means you have to store them somewhere unless you're shooting at 640x480.  I used a (work) laptop which was really too bulky.  I suggest having a look at the digital wallet (look it up on a search engine) or a second-hand old _small_ laptop.  It's great to preview the day just before going to bed :-)  It's also great to be able to show your B&amp;B hosts where you have been!

Other points:
o take a wide angle (28mm) lens.  The telephoto didn't get much use at all in comparison
o take lots of CF cards - I had 2x48MB, 1x24MB and 1x8MB and it was enough for the big day's of shooting (250 shots some days)
o remember to USE YOUR MACRO.  This is (IMHO) the _biggest_ advantage of the CP990 apart from the 3.34MPixels and printing to A3.  The vista and people may be uninteresting, but you'll *always* find something interesting at the macro level :-)
and lastly...
o don't wait!  It *is* expensive (but so is a good new 35mm) but I'm hooked.  The only thing is that Epson have been found out about their otherwise lovely 1270 A3 photo printer, but that's another story ;-)<br><br>
