            This winter I started planning to buy a new car.  My venerable Acura Integra lease would be expiring in the spring, and I knew from that experience what I wanted.  Or what I didn't want.  I wanted a quieter car than the Integra.  I wanted rear wheel drive -- the torque steer of the Integra never stopped bothering me.  I wanted an engine in the oversquare, DOHC style for high-rev power, at the expense of low-end torque.  A motorcycle engine, in other words.  Oh, and I was looking for a convertible.

I compared the soft-top versions of the Volvo C70, the Saab 93, the BMW 323, and I even sat, briefly, in a Sebring (ick) and a Corvette (which I found too small inside).

It ended up being a pretty easy decision.  The Saab's turbo lag and torque steer were so extreme that driving became almost like an arcade game.  The Saab also had an enormous amount of body flex: you could feel the whole car step into dips.  The Volvo didn't have turbo lag, but it did have that front-wheel drive thing going.  Driving the Volvo, you feel really distant from the road.  It's out there somewhere, but you're inside a big tub, and you really feel the pedigree -- it's just a converted family sedan.

I actually ended up at the BMW dealer as a kind of sanity-check.  I was ready to go with the Saab.  I've never liked the BMW archetype: I'd never thought I could be a BMW owner.  &quot;BMW's are all about image,&quot; I thought.

How wrong I was.  BMW's are about DRIVING!

This is just a spectacular car.  Start with the engine.  The Saab contains, essentially, an all-purpose GM engine with an 80's-style fat turbo.  Not a refined platform.  The Volvo is also an adapted engine.  The BMW engine is the best-engineered I've ever experienced.  It approaches my ideal linear power curve, all the way to redline.  The automatic transmission is the best ever made : choose &quot;drive&quot; mode for basic transportation.  Choose &quot;sport&quot; mode, and you can't help driving a little harder, taking advantage of the power between 4000 and 6000 RPM.  And you can run the gears yourself with the Steptronic, if you want.

The rest of the platform is just as good.  The main attribute you feel is &quot;linearity.&quot;  You feel the car is a direct extension of your will, as opposed to some separate thing you have to control.  (The Saab, with its ridiculous turbo, was especially alienating.)  Turn-in is quick, balance is more-neutral and more-modulatable (thanks to the rear-wheel drive) than the usual street car.  The feel of the brakes is predictable and solid.  The traction control and ABS work flawlessly, and are a big help in bumps, hard acceleration in corners, and marginal surface conditions.  The seats (I got the manual ones) are the most supportive and ergonomic I've ever experienced.  I'm fairly tall, and this is the only car I've ever owned that seems to have been designed, not just to lamely accomodate my height, but to make me comfortable.  I don't have to push the seat all the way back.

There's great space in the trunk -- you can fit two carry-ons and several smaller items -- especially for a convertible, and there's acceptable back-seat space.  The car is quieter than either the Volvo (which has more high-frequency noise) or the Saab (which is just plain louder), although the convertible is, of course, noticeably louder than the hardtop.

There are only a few downsides to the car.  The first, and most disconcerting, is a tortional resonance.  It's not that the car has the flexi-flyer characteristic of the Saab, where the doors rattle on their latches enough to pinch you.  The BMW feels solid, but over bumps, the windscreen wiggles, indicating torsional resonance in the floor pan.  It's not a small wiggle.  You look in the mirror, go over a bump, and you see the whole world shake about a quarter of an inch, about ten times, in the space of about a second.  By comparison, the Saab doesn't really shake, it's just sloppy.  The BMW is tight, but that tightness is like a tighter spring: it vibrates.  The shaking is a pretty good trade for the absence of a roof, but I think it would take some getting used to.

The only other downside is that the car would be even more fun with more power.  The 2.5L engine is well-optimized, and fun, for high-speed cruising, but you can get ahead of the car on twisty roads.  Wait until next year for the convertible M3, a 340 HP monster, which will give you more than enough to be a danger to yourself and others.

In summary, there's nothing even close to the 3 series convertible: nothing half as fun to drive, with as well-thought-out a cockpit, with four seats and a trunk, and without a steel top.  If you're well under six feet, or you're OK with much less cargo and passenger space, there are a few options, like the new MR2, or the Boxter, or even the BMW Z3, but these aren't cars you can really live with.  The BMW 323 Convertible can take you and your sweetie on a thrilling ride from San Francisco to Big Sur one weekend, and drag your three best friends and their luggage around town the next.  I'm a convert.<br><br>
