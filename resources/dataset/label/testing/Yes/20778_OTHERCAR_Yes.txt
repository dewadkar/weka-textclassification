            I bought this camera for myself as a xmas present.  Hoping to eventually cut down on the cost of processing worthless pictures of my kids ( you know...the closed lids,no flash,moving out of the frame..type of pictures).

I had been looking at the Canon A40 and liked all the features that it had, but it looked like just any other 35 mm camera in shape.  Both myself and my kids love the cybershot look, call us vain. I have only processed out 2 - 3 dozen pictures so far, and they turned out pretty good, except when I forgot to turn on the flash..still can't figure out why its not automatic.  I like that fact that I can resize my pix for either close ups or as email attachments.

As far as features go, the optical zoom is great and the ability to change the colour formats (b&W, Sepia, etc.) is a bonus too.  The only problem that I've found that I don't like is the fact that I can't take any wide angle shots, and pictures taken by looking at the lcd screen (which is very clear) tend to be a little deceptive (object appears a little close than actuality) I rarely find the need to use the little movie clip, since it has no sound anyways, I already have a digicam so this is not a big issue for me. The joystick pad might be a little difficult for people with large hands and fingers.  I even find it hard to push the exact center of the pad, which is needed to select menu options.

Anyways, overall I am happy with my purchase and expect to have this camera for a long while.  Its got just enough megapixels and features for me..plus its a sony.
