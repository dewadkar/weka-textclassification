            Although my family was looking at a Honda Odyssey, the 2000 models are next-to-impossible to find in my area.  We did extensive research and found that the Mazda MPV was quite similar to the Odyssey, in both quality and value.  We decided on a LX MPV -- the middle of the road in this model.  The LX comes with rear AC control so that the rear passengers can adjust the AC for their comfort and all vans come with AM/FM/CD standard -- a nice touch.  We decided on a van that came with the Four Seasons package which includes a rear heat control, heavy duty battery, larger cooling system, and a few other extras.  We also got the security package which includes remote keyless entry -- a GREAT option!  Although it states you should be fairly close to the vehicle to use this option, I've found that it works from across a crowded parking lot, during a heavy rain storm.  It was great to unlock the doors while standing under the grocery store awning and then make a dash for it!  The seats on this van are much firmer than the seats in my old Plymouth Voyager, but they are not uncomfortable.  The ride is a bit noisier than I expected, with some wind noise while on the highway.  The ride is quite smooth.  

The things I really like about the Mazda MPV is that the middle seats are captain's chairs that can slide to be next to each other (like a bench seat) or away from each other.  The back seat is WONDERFUL!  It folds completely down so that you can't even tell it was there and it is very easy to do this (even with one hand!)  The seat also flips backwards (so that the back becomes the seat and the seat becomes the back) and you can open up the back and sit, with your feet outside the vehicle and shaded by the hatch.  There is even an adaptor in the back so that you can plug in a TV or other appliances and have a tail-gate party.  The van also has passenger doors on both sides and the windows in the passenger doors can roll down (like a standard window).

The things I don't like about the Mazda MPV is that the interior is not as roomy as other vans.  The very back seat is quite cramped, even for children.  However, I do think that it has more room behind the back seat for luggage/cargo -- even more than my old Voyager.  Whoever designed the van must have been a tall man -- when I'm driving the gear shift arm totally blocks the first three buttons on the radio.  Also, there are a LOT of levers on the steering column -- the gear shift, cruise control, windshield wipers, and headlights.  Sometimes when I'm reaching for the cruise control, I will hit the gear shift instead, but I imagine I'll get use to the placement over time.

We have a family of six and are fairly comfortable in this van for long road trips.  I think it's a great buy for someone who wants a quality van at a decent price.<br><br>
