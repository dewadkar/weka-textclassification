            When I was looking for a car to trade in my Mazda 626 on I had three in mind.  I was looking at the Toyota Corolla(first choice), Suzuki Esteem(last choice), and the Dodge Neon.  I looked at both for about a month. Looking that long I learned a lot about all models considering I was a salesperson at the dealership at the time.  I was set on the Toyota but I didn't think I could get it for the price I wanted it for.  I thought I would have to go for either the Dodge Neon or the Suzuki Esteem.

  Turns out the same month that I was going to trade Dodge decided to run 0.9% financing on the Neon.  That made the decision for me.  $318 total interest over 5 years!.  I had done quite a bit of reading on the Neon and knew that they had past troubles.  The head gasket problems from 95-97, the transmission problems here and there, and the brake problems also.  Being that the 2000 edition Neon was a total redesign I thought, what the hell.  I have put about 9400 miles on this car in the last few months and I love it.  I haven't had any hint of a problem.  

   I'm getting about 32 miles to the gallon right now.  I bought the Black ES that we had on the lot.  It is a 5spd.  It looks great and drives better.  This car will hold turns better than a Mustang!(Car and Driver)  I think the stats were .82G on the skid pad.  It does not lean at all.  The engine is a power house after 3000 RPM.  I can hit 60 in second without blinking.  I am very happy with this car.  With the price tag you can't argue with it.  <br><br>
