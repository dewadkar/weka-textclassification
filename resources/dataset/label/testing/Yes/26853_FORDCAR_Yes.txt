            this vehicle is safe, i love the 4 wheel drive which is almost slip thru in the weather we are having right now, driving this car is like riding a cloud, the ride is calm and not bumpy i recommend this to tall people and people who love to half some fun on the streets. the car can handle in tough situation like snow and mud,the inside is roomy, the back seat is even comfortable enough to sit in. It cost is well for a vehicle this size too. the car is equiped with a A4WD, 4H or 4L so u can set up your driving style, the car is also big enought to carry loads of camping stuff or boxes to work, it s acar suitable for every person a workamn or fun having person or BOTH.<br><br>
