            I bought a Honda Accord EX for its reputation.  I like the EX model because it has anti-lock brakes as a standard option.  My Honda has a V-tech engine, so even though it is only a 4-cylinder car, it has more power than the average 4-cylinder auto.  I chose a 5-speed since that gives me more control over the power and better gas mileage.  The accord gets great gas mileage, is a comfortable ride, and it has good handling.  My in-laws have 2 Honda Accords, one is a 1987 Accord that has over 250,000 miles on it, and the other is a 1992 Accord with aver 175,000 miles on it.  Both cars have had only routine work on them as far as mechanics go.  This really influenced me to buy my Accord.  One of my complaints is that Honda doesn't make the V-6 Accord in a 5-speed--only automatic.  That makes no sense to me.  I would have bought a 5 speed V-6 if they made one.  Also, the radio that comes this this car has a terribly sensitive volume knob, and the air/heat controls are cheap.  Other than that, I love my Accord.  <br><br>
