            My husband and I bought a Dodge Grand Caravan SE because we owned two pick-ups and had a growing family.  We saw a 1999 lease return advertised in out hometown paper for a good price at a local dealership. We decided to investigate it.  We fell in love with our Caravan at first sight!
We originally thought about buying an SUV, but thought better of it.  We like the fact that the Caravan is front wheel drive.  We live in a cold climate and needed something that could handle icy roads. We also needed something roomy for long trips to see family.  SUVs can't compare in the amount of room, and they don't get as good gas mileage.  Also, we noticed that the cost of licensing an SUV is more than a Caravan and the insurance is a lot higher also.  Driving our car is like driving a mid-sized car.  It doesn't feel bulky or large at all.  It handles nicely and the seats are very comfortable. Anyone with a family who's looking for a car with room should look at the Dodge Caravan.  I don't think this car would be ideal for small families and couples.  I have to admit, however, that if I didn't have children, I would still like this car. <br><br>
