            I purchased a 1996 Toyota Camry in August of 1998. At first, I was a little skeptical of buying a &quot;used&quot; car. The first thing I noticed about the car was how smooth the drive was. I was absoulutely amazed at how quiet the car was as I was going home that very first day. The only maintenance I have spent on my car were oil changes and new tires. I have 72,000 miles on my car and it runs like it have 10,000. The interior of the car is beautiful and very roomy. The back seats fold down to make more room in the trunk. Overall I would recommend this car for anyone. <br><br>
