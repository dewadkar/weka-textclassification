            This car is one of the best vehicles I have ever driven. The Firehawk package only adds to the sweetness.

Exterior: It looks very cool, low and fast. With the SLP hood and the optional SLP rear deck spoiler, the car looks even better. I like the integrated Pop-ups, and the twin rectangle lights look awesome at night. I prefer to leave my lights up, unless I am driving at high speeds. I like the rear flood lights, too. The remind me of insect eyes. It's a cool look.The t-tops are nice, and the fog lights are sweet.

Interior: The interior is nice but the dash looks a bit cheap on the passenger side. The instruments are easy to read and have this cool orange illumination at night. The sound system is good, and the seats are extremely comfortable. The back bench is fairly big, but anyone over 6'1 should not sit back there. I'm 5'11, and it's pretty tight, but bearable. The cargo space is good to have, too. The leather is very nice as well.


Handling: This car is more than just straight line speed. With the Firehawk package, you get an improvement over the already excellent Trans-am's handling, and the optional 1LE suspension is good for racetrack driving, and the handling response is excellent. But, what you gain in performance you lose in comfort, as at high speed the ride is so rough that it will rattle your fillings out. But, If you race your Firehawk[like me] the 1LE is a must. I give credit for the Goodyear's on the car, too. Offering good grip, they are overall better than the stock Firestone's the car comes with. But, abuse this car like me, and it will eat tires fast.


Performance: This is the best part about the Firehawk. The six speed is crisp and smooth, and the power is very good. The torque is impressive[350 lbs./ft] and the acceleration is great. The skip-shift is somewhat annoying, but you adjust to it over time. There is some way to stop it I hear, but I don't know how. The car's limiter has been taken off, and I have pushed the car to 172 mph, but I am sure it can go faster.Since it is light, the car will rocket off the line, but be careful, if you are not ready the car's back end will slide out, it already happened to me.
