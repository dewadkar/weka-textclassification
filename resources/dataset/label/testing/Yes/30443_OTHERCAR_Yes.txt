            My wife and I leased a 2000 Toyota Corolla LE model in October 1999.  As of this writing (October, 2001) we have just over 20,000 miles on the car.  Here are my updated impressions of the vehicle:

Other than oil changes and tire rotations, we've only added gas and windshield washer fluid.  That's better than we expected.

The driver's floor mat, which was worn a year ago, has only gotten worse.  It hasn't worn completely through, but it will be interesting to see what the dealer says when we turn the car in next October (2002) at the end of our 3 year lease.

The CD player, which is mounted below the radio unit, isn't that great.  It's the factory, single CD version.  On cold days it skips terribly, even on smooth roads.

A few weeks ago a jug of dishwasher liquid detergent lost its lid on the way home from the grocery store and leaked below the back seat.  It was pretty nasty smelling since it's concentrated.  But I was able to easily remove the lower part of the back seat by grabbing at the back and yanking upwards.  It was *much* easier to remove than I thought and weighs very little.  It's mostly foam.  The back seats in the LE model fold down by pulling a couple of levels in the trunk.  Cleanup of this mess was a snap.

We now have a second child, so the back seat is taken up by both kids, a 2 year old and an 8 month old.  We'll be buying or leasing something bigger when the lease on the Corolla is up.  We don't plan on buying the car.

That's it for the two year retrospect.  Below is information from previous updates, if you wish to read on - I've read through it and felt it was applicable to the review.

Regarding the car's performance:  The Corolla's 1.8 VVT-i engine produces 125 horsepower with an EPA rated gas mileage of 31 city/38 highway.  Our previous car, a 1995 VW Jetta III with a 2.0 litre 4 cylinder with 5-speed manual, seemed less peppy compared to the Corolla.  Acceleration in the Corolla is quick, sometimes with a bit of oversteer if you punch it, but this is normal for front-drive cars.  Passing on 2-lane highways is very good, especially if you drop down to 3rd gear.  In our combined city and highway driving we normally get 32-35mpg.  On strictly 2-lane (55mph) highway driving we get into the low 40's.  On interstate (65-70mph) driving we get 35mpg.

A couple neat features when you first sit in the driver's seat.  The "outside temperature" gauge sold us.  Normally this is a product in a more expensive car.  The LCD readout is clean and unimposing.  The other feature is the arrow pointing to which side the fuel door is on.  Nice work, Toyota.  I can't ever remember which side it's on.

The front seat moves way back.  I'm 6'2" and have no trouble fitting into the seats.  There's no sunroof on our model so headroom is good.  Back seat is adequate for a small car.  Our daughter's car seat fits well behind my wife.

We got the LE model, which has full electrics, fold down rear seats, and remote openers for fuel and trunk.  We also got the optional CD player in the car.  Our last car had a 6-CD changer in the trunk.  I prefer the single in-dash model on the Corolla.  The in-dash CD player very very rarely skips, unlike changers in the trunk.  The glove box holds numerous CDs and jewel boxes.  The cubby hole inbetween the driver and passenger holds between 8 and 10 CDs perfectly.

Another option we got was the cargo net.  It will hold 4 to 6 plastic bags full of groceries.  It easily comes off if you need to put in larger packages.

The only thing I dislike about the Corolla is that it rounds corners rather clumsily at times.  I'm no speed racer, but our older Jetta and our even-older BMW handled more decisively.  It's not an obvious thing, just something I noticed from our previous cars.  It could be the stock tires we received, which - by the way - did very well during last winter.  Compared to domestics I've driven the Corolla is still quite good.

I've driven Corollas in the past (1978 and 1989 models) and thought they were very good cars.  Previous Corollas (heck, most Toyotas) have had problems with rust, so we decided to lease since we live in a city that salts the streets all winter.
