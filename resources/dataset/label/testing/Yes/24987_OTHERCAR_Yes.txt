            When I rented a car last week they offered me a Lumina as a full size car, and I accepted it. The Lumina for 2000 has largely been replaced in Chevy's line-up by the 2000 Impala, but apparently there are still quite a few in the hands of the rental car agencies, including Alamo, where I rented. I think if you want to buy, you'll have to buy used now.
I was driving about 400 miles each way, so I have put on almost 1000 miles over the past week. Here is my rundown on this car:
It gets great gas mileage- up around 30 on the road. Very good for a full size, five-passengers-with-luggage car.
It is quiet and smooth on the road- much quieter than the full-size Dodge Intrepid that I rented the week before. (See my review of the Dodge Intrepid for more details) But its seats are not up to par for a full size road car. If you are taking a trip, I think any car should offer some lumbar support, and an adjustment to make it firmer for longer trips. There is no adjustment on the Lumina, at least on the version provided at the rental car counter.
The car is conservatively styled, but looks good, and is fine for all the things you need a big car for- hauling other people, hauling stuff in the trunk, and parking around town. It reminds me of the old Holiday Inn advertising- &quot;the best surprise is no surprise.&quot; There are no surprises in the Lumina, positive or negative. 
This is a basic Chevrolet- which means it is plenty of car, at a very attractive price. My guess is that these cars, with light mileage, will be available for a very good price now, since their styling has now been made out of date by the new Impala. My rental car had 24,000 miles, and it ran like new- no sign of anything wearing out or becoming loose.
If I were looking for a good full size car in the range of $15,000, I would definitely look at this one- especially for around town driving. For longer trips, I would not be happy with the seats- they just don't give enough support.<br><br>
