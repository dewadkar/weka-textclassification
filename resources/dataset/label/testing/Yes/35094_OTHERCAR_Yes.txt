            I got a new Mavica FD 200 for work about 2 weeks ago. Previously I had used several Kodaks and an Olympus. My job required an easy to use camera with and a way to easily transfer photos.

The Sony comes with its own brand of rechargeable battery. The battery is unique because it can accurately tell you(thru the viewfinder) how much time you have left on it. I've been able to use it for about an hour on one charge. You charge the battery inside the camera which is nice. You simply attach the charger to the camera.

The first thing out of the box you'll notice is that this is not a small camera! However, it's not heavy and actually fits well in your hands. The next thing you'll notice is a lack of an optical viewfinder. The only way to take pictures is thru the LCD screen. Thankfully it's a large 2.5" screen that is easy to look at.

The camera comes with a USB cable, a neck strap and a lens strap as well as a very thorough manual.

The manual is quite thick and is incredibly easy to read. Fortunately, the camera is quite simple to operate and you really only need to use the manual for reference.

What's missing from the box is any type of recordable media. The FD200 can take pictures from 3.5" Disk or Memorystick but neither is included. It would be nice to have them include a few disks or even a 8MB memorystick.

The camera fits comfortably in your hand. On the back is the large viewfinder, a disk eject button, and a switch from disk to memorystick option. There are also buttons for focus, program and display as well as a jog dial to navigate the menus. The power on/off button is in a convenient spot and has a thumb lever to prevent accidentally turning it off or on. All in all the layout is well thought out and very effective.

The FD200 is a 2 Megapixel Camera. It's good enough for 8" X 10" photo prints and below. Depending on whether you have a disk or memorystick installed it will alter the compression of the pictures. You can fit anywhere from 4 to 40 pictures on a 3.5" disk depending on the size and compression. 

I'd recommend at least getting a 32mb memorystick though - they're not expensive and it's a good option. 

The camera comes with a 3X optical and 2X digital zoom lens. The zoom button is on the front of the camera and you can adjust it with your right index finger. It works great.

I've taken about 100 pictures with the camera and have been incredibly pleased with all of them. The photos are vivid and colorful and full of detail. Other reviews I read criticized the cameras night picture capability but I've been happy with this one so far.

The viewfinder is very large and quite easy to use. I haven't really missed the optical viewfinder so far. The only drawback to the viewfinder is that is it difficult to take pictures at night while looking thru it.

I haven't used the Pixela software that came with the camera yet. Other reviews (http://www.megapixel.net) said it was poor though.

The menu system for the camera is very simple to use. Thanks to the large viewfinder everything can be clearly read. You use the jog dial to navigate thru the options. You can choose the image size/quality and some other options as well. You can change the ISO setting too. 

All in all the menu system is incredibly easy to operate. Options are in plain english and even the most novice of users should have little difficulty navigating the menu system.

For those looking for a lot of camera settings (F-Stop, etc) look elsewhere. Other than the ISO and some minor settings this camera is a point and click. The camera takes excellent pictures by simply pointing and clicking.

You can also record small mini-movies on the camera. I've yet to use this option. Note these are silent movies as there is no sound.

I've been pleasantly surprised with this camera. I like the memorystick/floppy disk option. It takes beautiful pictures and is very simple to operate. It isn't a small camera but it fits very nice in your hand. It's not heavy either.

I would have liked a memorystick or a few disks included with the camera. It's a shame they didn't include them. 

The camera isn't cheap considering it's only a 2 Megapixel Camera. However, for anyone who likes the convenience of a floppy it's a great camera. Being able to take a picture then hand someone a disk is very nice. If you want a lot of pictures just insert a memorystick and away you go.

This is a great beginner camera, albeit on the expensive side.

Great Camera!
