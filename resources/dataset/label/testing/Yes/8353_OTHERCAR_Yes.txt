            After my experience with Agfa CL-18 I decided to stay away of any digital camera under $100 until a week ago when my son came home with a Largan Lmini 350. I started explaining him that he just wasted $115 (Canadians) but I was relieved to find that the store will refund the money if you are not happy with the quality of the pictures it takes if you bring it back with a brand new battery. To show him what a mistake he made I pull out the camera from the box, hook it to the AC adapter and shot some picture in our basement using the flash. We went then to my computer load the software and connect the camera. Out of 5 pictures taken 2 were completely washed out by the flash, but the other 3 looked decent. I figured out that the flash fires at the same level no matter how close you are so I disconnected the camera and I took few more pictures at different distances. I came back and check. All the pictures where the subject was between 6 and 10 feet were fine. The software was easy and fun to use and it did a good job in improving the quality of the initial shot. 
We decided it is worth to see how the day light pictures will come out so next day I took the camera outside and shot another 10 pictures around the house. Except for the distortions due to a very high level of compression the pictures were good. I continued taking pictures until all the memory was full. I downloaded them to my computer (it takes about 4 minutes to download 10 pictures and almost 20 minutes to download a full memory and delete it) and went back outside to take some more pictures. After about 60 pictures taken, only a small part of them using the flash, the battery had to be replaced ($5 CDN/pc, $20 CDN the pack of four if you buy them from Costco) so you pay almost the same price per picture taken as if you use film.
Of course I printed few of them on our Epson and the quality of a 3.5X5" is the same with what I'm getting from my regular Minolta camera.
It was the time to draw a line and make a decision and I think you know what I did, I kept the camera.
