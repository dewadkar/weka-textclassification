            After months of research about what to look for in digital cameras, I narrowed it down to my Kodak DC240. It came with all the necessary cables and connectors I needed for simple usage. The DC240 does everything you basically want it to do.... except talk to you. The images are just beyond beautiful. The software (Picture Easy 3.1) is so simple to use and you can do so much with it. I use my DC240 for just about any occasion and my family loves the pictures I e-mail. How convenient can it get? I think this product is great for those people who are just getting into the new technological age, like myself. Well not only for beginners, but for the professionals also. Anybody could enjoy the DC240.<br><br>
