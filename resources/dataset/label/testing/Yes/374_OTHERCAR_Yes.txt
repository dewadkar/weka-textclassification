            The Nissan Xterra is a great move forward for SUVs.  Before if you wanted a new SUV for 20 grand you had to make a choice.  You could get a true SUV that kicked butt off road but was horrible on the pavement; the Jeep Cherokee.  You could get the best off road machine there is, but have no cargo capacity; the Jeep Wrangler.  You could look like a moron and drive a stupid looking car with all wheel drive; the CR-V and RAV-4 (well, they really aren't even SUVs).
The Xterra is a Jeep Cherokee that rides well on road and has a much higher level of refinement.  In fact the Xterra doesn't lag that far behind a Cherokee off road!!
The Xterra is targeted at people with &quot;active&quot; lifestyles.  But I recommend it to anyone who wants a real SUV on a budget.
The V6 provides good power and the transmission is smooth.  If the Xterra is anything like the Pathfinder it will be extremely reliable.
The interior is nicely appointed and quite comfortable.  You won't hear every rattle and feel every bump like you will in a Cherokee.
The styling is a definite plus.  The Xterra has an aggressive stance and nice lines.
Handling is pretty good as well.  You'll know its not a car, but not by that much.
If you want an SUV for 20 K look no further.<br><br>
