            I bought this car brand new. In Jan 1, 2004 at 74,000 miles, it was totalled by an airhead driving 50 mph in a residential area. I loved this car and had planned to continue driving it for at least another five years. The only major problem I had with it was a head gasket going when the car was three days out of warranty. I was <b>extremely</b> unhappy about this and made my feelings on it <b>perfectly clear</b> to the dealership. They made it right with a greatly reduced repair bill. I have heard that a good portion of the earlier Neons end up in the shop with the same problem. The car went in shortly after I purchased it for a recall repair. I don't remember what the recall was for, however, if a person were buying this car used, it would be beneficial to find out if the repair had been made when the recall was issued. The final problem I had was trivial, however the car was still under warranty...the paint on the gas cap cover faded dramatically for no apparent reason. The dealership fixed this at no cost to me.<br><br>
Aside from this, the Neon has probably been the best car I've ever owned. It had never broken down on the road and I've taken it often on road trips of a thousand miles or more. It's never needed a jump start even in sub-zero weather with no block heater installed. It handles on snow and ice as well as one can expect from a car of its size and class. It even manages fairly well on roads marked for 4WD vehicles, but because of its low clearance, it is not a good idea to take it out on heavily rutted roads (guess how I know that? :-)<br><br>
The biggest disappointment to me about the car has nothing to do with the car itself, but its current value. The car new cost me $14,000. High book on it six years later is only $3,700. I might add though, that even totalled out, this car is still runable. The above mentioned airhead that smashed into my parked car rammed the rear bumper and trunk in about six inches. The impact caused the Neon to move 40 feet down the street, smashing the front end into a parked 3/4 ton pick up. The hood is bent and the passenger side headlight is wonky. The trunk cannot be opened, the frame is bent, the rear bumper had to be pulled away from the rear wheels and a tail light is smashed. Hard to believe, but the thing is mechanically sound, I'm still driving it in its squished state while I wait on the insurance to pay out.
