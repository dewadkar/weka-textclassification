            I remember it just like it was yesterday, we pulled into the Honda dealership and this red, sporty looking car caught my eye. I thought in my head, I could never get that, it's too nice, too expensive, etc. etc.

Well, to make a long story short, I was wrong. My family and I bought the car and I got to drive it home the same day! We got a good deal on it. The sticker price was around 23,500 but we got to take it home for under 20,000.

After shopping, comparing , and being picky, I finally found the car that I wanted and I am very pleased with it.

What attracted me to the Honda Accord Coupe was:
1)Style
 It is sleak, sporty, and classy all at the same time. I found it to be much more attractive than the regular 4-door Accord.  
2) Room and Comfort
The Accord coupe is also very roomy for a 2-door. The back seat is comfortable. With its bucket seat style in the back, you just sink comfortably into the seat.  The backseat is also pretty roomy compared to most 2-doors.  I was able to fit my friend's child car seat back there and stand in the back seat while I hooked it up. 
3) Visibility
Sometimes the back window of a 2-door is too small or something and can make it hard to see cars that are behind you in the next lane. I found that with the Accord Coupe, my visibility had greatly increased in comparison to other 2-doors that I test drove.
4) Safety
My Accord Coupe has passenger and driver front airbags and side airbags that are built into the seat. The car is large enough inside so that you don't feel squished or that you are in a death trap. (:
5) Radio Options
My Accord Coupe came with an in-dash 6 CD changer, AM/FM Radio, and a cassette player. It has a great sound system with six speakers. 

In conclusion, it's a great car and I highly recommend it.
