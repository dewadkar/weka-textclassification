            I always loved the looks of the 3000GT and thought owning one last real sports car would be a treat I shouldn't deprive myself of. The handling and performance of this car are only the begining of the adventure. The braking system is far superior to anything I expected. You always feel in total control under any conditions. After traveling 44,000 miles on the original tires, I opted for some Kelly Springfield allweather tires. I was a little leary that the handling would suffer from a harder rubber compound but have found no real difference and the tires only ran $95.00 each mounted and balanced. They are rated for 60,000 miles. The only problem has been changing the fuel filter without leaking.<br><br>
