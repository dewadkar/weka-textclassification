            After extensive research I decided on the Fuji FinePix 1400 Z.  I based my decision on epinions and other web sites.  In its megapixel range and price range it was the favorite among just about all reviewers.  I was especially pleased with two features.

First, I think the close-up pictures are excellent.  I bought this camera to take photos for ebay sales, and I couldn't be happier with my choice.  I feel like this camera takes some of the best close-ups that I've seen (at least on ebay).  I don't want to mislead anyone: you won't confuse these pictures for professional shots, but they're still very clear.  I also am pleased with my regular photos.  I mainly take pictures of my daughter, and I've never had a red eye.

The second feature which impressed me was the ease of use.  After about 10 minutes of scanning the manual and playing around with the camera, I was able to use most of the features.  In addition, the software installed immediately, and I was able to download photos after about 10 minutes of playing with the software.

The disadvantages are the lack of included memory and the battery usage.  I would recommend getting the largest memory card that you can afford as it is not convenient to change cards, and they are easy to lose.  It is my understanding that all digital cameras eat up batteries, so that came as no surprise.

For anyone who wants to sell items on ebay or take snapshots of family, I highly recommend this camera.  I'm not a photographer, so I can only attest to the fact that the pictures are all clear and the features are easy to use.
