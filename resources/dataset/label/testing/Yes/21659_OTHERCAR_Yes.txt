My husband &amp; I purchased a 1997 Mazda Millenia S in April 99, for my B-day. My husband did all the work. He researched it, and selected it for me. When I saw it, I fell in love with it. This car had all the little luxury's.  Seat Warmers for the two front seats, cup &amp; coin holders. Power Windows, Power Brakes/Steering. Moonroof, and lighted Mirror's on both visor mirrors. CD/Cassette/AM &amp; FM radio. Intermittant Windshield Wipers, and rear window defogger.  Leather interior, with lumbar supports. With a huge amount of trunk space. Even a seat divider or arm rest for the back seat.  I even liked the special Opal pearlized color. Little did I know that I would have more then the looks to fall in love with! You never think that this will ever happen to you! Car accidents always happen to the other guy. Well that's not true. 

  I was involved in a partial head on and side collision, two weeks ago. This happened at 700am, on a rainy gloomy morning, and the guy who hit me was returning home after working all night. I work rotating off days, and had to be at work that Sunday morning at 800am. Needless to say, I didn't get to work that day!  My car saved my life. I had no time to avoid the accident, but my car did what it was suppose to in order to save my life.

 Here are the details, as I remember them.  I was wearing my seat belt, and it definitely restrained my body,[[I had the bruises to prove it]] as well as the Airbag inflating and protecting my face &amp; head from further damage. I did receive some swelling, and  bruising on my lips, nose, and cheeks from the airbag inflating, and except for some minor soreness with my nose, all the rest of my facial injuries disappeared within a week.  The glass on the driver's side shattered into a million &quot;beads&quot; but there were no sharp edges at all on the window.  My front window was extremely cracked, but did not fall in or shatter on me.  I was hit from the center of the front hood down the left side. The car took the force of the impact before crumpling like an accordion. I went into a 360 spin, and landed in a ditch near the driveway of someone's house. The passenger side airbag also inflated, I think mainly because as I was spinning, I hit a mailbox and small stone wall. I don't remember the airbag's inflating, they just did their jobs. I was able to escape from the car thru the no-window drivers side, miraculously I had no major injuries.  

  My Mazda was still running, and I remember returning to the car to shut of the engine. Then I didn't see my car for two days, when I finally had the courage to go to the wrecker's to take pictures. Of course, my Mazda was totaled. My car Saved my Life. It took the brunt of the oncoming Truck. And I will be forever grateful!

  The end result, is that as soon as we settle with the insurance company, I will be searching for a New Mazda Millenia. I survived, and feel that the Millenia, with all it's niceties &amp; luxury's still provided enough safety components to protect me when I needed it.
