            This is an excellent camera from Sony. Sporting a Carl Zeiss lens, zooming from 38-190, being fast (f2.0) and coming in the shape that was started by the 505, this is a promising camera.

In full auto, out of the box, this machine takes sharp photos. Blow them up and you will wow your friends. And while some find it hard to hold, it is quite easy. Left hand cradles the lens, and thumb falls to where the zoom buttons are. Right hand holds the body, that can be swivelled. Held this way, you can hold it steady and take steady shots.

Like any good camera worth its salt, you have aperture and shutter priority as well as full manual. Controls are well placed and easy to get the hang of.

Buy Sony's memory stick (and you will need one or two because of the large files 5MP takes) and you are set to go. What other camera tells you how much power is left in the batteries? And it has a charge that lasts a long time. But once again you have to buy a Sony battery. And you have to buy a Sony flash. No hotshoe, and no PC terminal.

The Night Shot mode is a first. 

So, you can use its LCD, or view finder (also a small LCD), you can hold the camera at waist level due to the camera-lens swivel mechanism, or hold it above your in journalist style and still see what you are framing.

But this camera has problems. And big problems, if you take it seriously. In low light in manual settings the LCD blanks out. Not good. Flash shots force a wide f2.0. Most flash pictures come out blue, and manual settings make them worse, forcing you to color balance all your photos after you have taken them. Sony had a fix but you have to send in the camera as Sony doesnt trust the user to upgrade its firmware.
