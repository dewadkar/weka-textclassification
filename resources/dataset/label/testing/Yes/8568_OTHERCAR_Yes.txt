            Allrighty! Now let me tell you about a car everyone should own. It's a &quot;you guessed it&quot; Pontiac Grand Am. And how grand it is. I myself own a 1994 Model, and wouldn't trade for the world. From it's Powerful Profile, to it's comfortable interior, It's packs plenty of boost from it's 2.3L Single Over Cam Quad Engine. (Also available with a 2.3L DOHC Quad Four, And a trendy V6 Package) If you have a small family this is the car for you, It's roomy enough for 4 and the kids toys if your on a long trip.The repair costs of this vehicle are not so grand, plan on forking out the dough, when taking to the shop. <br><br>
