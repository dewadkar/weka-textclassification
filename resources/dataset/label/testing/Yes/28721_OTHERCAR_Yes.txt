            About one year ago I decided to sell some items on eBay and needed a cheap digital camera to do the job.  I went out and bought one from Polaroid for about $50, not wanting to waste my money on something I won't use often.  Although my $50 digital camera did take okay pictures for eBay, it was completely dead within 3 months of light use.  

This year I again wanted to take some very basic, no quality needed, pictures for eBay but realized that another $50 camera that would be thrown out later really was a waste of money, so I went out to buy a better model.  I wasn't thrilled about putting out $200 for something I would rarely use but figured it would be there when I did want to use it and so I bought the Olympus D-380.  

Since buying my Olympus camera I have realized that getting the right equipment can make all the difference.  Not only do I use it for eBay now, it has completely replaced my regular film camera.  

After leaving the store with my purchase, I was already taking pictures on the way home.  At home, I installed the software and was uploading and editing my pictures within 15 minutes. 

For me, having the viewing screen on the camera was the best feature for such an inexpensive camera.  I don't waste time or memory space on pictures that didn't come out right, I just delete them and retake the picture in seconds.  The camera does also have a flash which does a great job in dark areas and really illuminates in all the right places.  It does have zoom capability but the instant it zooms in, the picture will get significantly grainy so I prefer to zoom in on a subject by using the (very simple to use) editing software that comes with the camera.  That way I crop and zoom in on my picture and still retain all the quality.

Battery life is an issue with any camera, this one is no different so make sure to always use rechargables.  Another thing I would suggest is immediately buying an extra memory card.  The camera can only take a few pictures of good quality on the memory it comes with.  The little cards are very cheap in exchange for the space it will give you.

One last thing about this camera.  I took it on a trip with me and forgot to load up my laptop with the software to make it work.  I was so disappointed that I couldn't send any pictures to people back home.  I decided to hook it up to my Windows Me laptop anyway and see what would happen.  To my relief, I was able to upload the pictures and send them through AOL even without any software or programs installed.  My computer recognized the camera as an extra hard drive and I was able to send my pictures just as well.  I am still amazed that this new camera worked so well with my old laptop, even without the needed software. 

I have been very happy with how my Olympus has turned a digital camera into something I used once a year into my main camera.  I can't wait to go out and get one of those new printers made for dig. cameras so I can expand its capabilities even more.
