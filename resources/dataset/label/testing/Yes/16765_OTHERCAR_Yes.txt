            I have had an Olympus OM-1 manual SLR camera for 20 years. These cameras are unlike the norm of today, where you have that great option of point-and-click. Back then they made cameras with adjustable features such as aperature and shutter speed. You could play with the brightness and contrast of your photos, and control the outcome of the image. 

A few years back I started to get into digital photography for the sake of selling things on ebay. Now while I knew that my old Olympus camera would take amazing pictures, getting them developed and scanning them was just too time consuming and costly. I bought a digital camera. From Agfa, to Kodak, back to the company who's camera I'd grown to love.

I was amazed upon first inspection of the Olympus C-4000Z. It's size was that of a regular camera, not too small like most digital cameras, or vice versa. I found that you can manually adjust the shutter speed and aperature like an old SLR, you have the options of taking black and white photographs and there are some color filters available as well. The zoom on this camera is amazing, especially with the macro feature it offers, where you can get incredibly close to an object with perfect clarity. 

There are extra lenses available from Olympus that will work on this camera if you are as into photography as I am. If you know how to adjust shutter speed and so on this is a great digital camera, that might make you consider retiring your classic. If you don't know how to do all those fancy manual things, this camera is still good for pointing and clicking while looking like an expert took the picture. Only shaky hands could mess a picture up.

For people who are into web design this is an ideal camera because of the available resolutions for pictures. everything from 2-20" pictures. you can save them as .jpg or .tiff files, so if you wanted to get a picture blown up at kinkos you could bring the .tiff file in right off the camera and they can print it for you. Amazing is the only word for this.

I have actually stopped using my old camera for all but taking far away shots. This is an amazing camera, and while it is expensive, you really do get what you pay for.
