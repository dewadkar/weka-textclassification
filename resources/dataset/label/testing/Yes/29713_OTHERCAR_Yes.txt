            So the wife and I decided to take a day trip to Seattle, and this required renting a car.  My wife feels unsafe in small econo boxes so we decided the extra $3/day from Thrifty was worth it for a bigger car.  We ended up getting a 2003 Dodge Stratus Coupe.  It was definitely worth $3 more than a Neon.

Exterior

The first thing we noticed was that this car sits low to the ground meaning sports car low.  This made getting in and out somewhat difficult, and I always got my pants dirty from rubbing on the door sill.  Nevertheless we found the styling attractive; it reminded me of Dodge Chargers from the 70s.  Since it was raining the entire day I didn't look at fit and finish too carefully, but it seemed decently put together.  

Interior

The interior was pleasant enough.  The seating position is very much like a sports car meaning low.  You sink down low, lay back, and peer over the dash and hood.  I kinda felt like I was in a low rider cruising the streets of east LA.  The controls and dash all had a Japanese feel to them, which is not surprising since they are shared with the Mitsubishi Eclipse.  This is a good thing since, since most Japanese controls are well designed and engineered, and indeed they worked well and were easy to use.  The white faced gages looked a little plain and boring in my opinion because they seemed too small in the big black dash.  The worst part about the interior was rear visibility.  The rear window is small and highly sloped, so there is only a small slit to look out of.  I found backing the car up to be very difficult, requiring the use of the side mirrors.  The seats were comfortable and in the 8 hours or so of driving we noticed no discomfort.  I can't comment on the rear seat, but I imagine it is fine for short trips.  Other than this there were plenty of cup holders and the trunk was roomy.  All in all the interior is a pleasant place to spend time.

Drive train
Our car had the optional V6 with automatic transmission, and power was adequate.  It wasn't as torquey as other engines, but it accelerated well and the automatic transmission worked well with it.  The engine was smooth, and had a nice exhaust note.  I imagine a 5 speed with the same engine would have given a more more sporty feel.  The car had more than enough power for everyday use, but it wasn't what I would call sporty.

Handling
In a word the handling is fine.  Since it was raining the whole day I couldn't exactly push the car to it's limits, but it drives similarly to most well engineered front wheel drive cars.  The was decent road feel and the car tracked well on the highway.  It was no MINI, but it should probably handle better than your average Toyota Camry.  I think most people that buy this car would do so for cruising around, and at this task it excels.  I have nothing really bad to say about it.

Economy
The one other noteworthy thing was that it seemed to get good gas mileage.  we only used about 8 gallons of gas in about 225 miles of mixed driving.  That's pretty good for a V6.

Summary
Honestly I don't know why there aren't more of these cars on on the road.  I see very few here in Northern California.  The styling is nice, the quality is decent, and it is not too expensive.  This is a good car for someone wanting a Mitsubishi Eclipse with more distinctive and elegant styling.  Since it shares the same mechanicals as a Mitsubishi Eclipse and there are plenty of Mitsubishi tuners out there, I imagine you could customize it into a fun car.  This is also a great car for someone just wanting a nicely styled cruiser.  If Daimler-Chrysler gave this thing 250 HP,  and a nice 6 speed manual transmission they would have a very nice car.
