            The purchase of a minivan is a gimmie for us, we're six in the family.
This is the 3rd caravan/voyager the first being a 86? and the second being a 96 caravan. The 1999 voyager seems to have gotten things right, with over 20000km (12000mi) on it so far no problems, the 1996 brakes had already been replaced along with the rack and pinion at that point. It's great for hauling kids to and fro, and for shopping. This van drives almost like a car, I have driven the ford aerostar and the windstar, both of which handle like wet sponges in comparison. Fit and finish on my model is good, with no rattles or excessive wind noise. I was recently in a rented 2000? grand caravan se and the fit and finish was poor, with wiper arms not adjusted and headlights aimed too low, so I guess it's a matter of chance if you get a tightly built van. The visibility from the front seat is great, and the climate controls work well at keeping the windows fog free, the rear defrost and rear wiper buttons are a little difficult to find however. In the base model there are no air ducts in the back seats, this should be a standard feature in any van as without them it takes forever to heat up the back. There is ample head room for an adult of 6' but leg room is somewhat limited.<br><br>
