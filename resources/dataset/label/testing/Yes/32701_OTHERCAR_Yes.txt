            I've worked in the automotive industry for over 10 years for a company that supplies most of the automotive manufacturers.  During the last 10 years I've driven almost every vehicle out there priced under $50K.  

My favorite vehicle from the last 10 years?  Hands down the Chrysler 300M.  I had a 300M as my company supplied vehicle for 6 months and when my 6 months was up and I had to swap, I kept postponing my appointment to swap the vehicle because I didn't want to give it up.

Not only does the car turn heads but it is so fun to drive.  The Autostick feature which allows you to shift gears like a manual transmission without having to use the clutch gives you the performance of the manual transmission without the ache of your clutch foot in stop and go traffic.

Nothing like whipping through the streets of Detroit with the sunroof open and the stereo blasting and the wind blowing through the vehicle.  All of this for only $30K....I have had much more expensive vehicles that I didn't enjoy driving half as much as this one.

So, if you are looking for a 4 door sedan that gives you the ability to pack the kids in the back seat and still turn some heads and squall some tires, look no farther than the 300M.<br><br>
