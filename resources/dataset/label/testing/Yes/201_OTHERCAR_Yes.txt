            My family and I have had the honor of owning the 95� Isuzu Rodeo for more than two years now. The SUV is at the top of its game when it comes to being rugged and dependable. We purchased this vehicle used already and have now put about 40,000 more miles on it for a total of approx. 90,000 miles. This vehicle is just like a Timex &quot; Takes a lickin and keeps on trucking.&quot; In the two years that we have owned this vehicle we have only put in a clutch and have changed the timing belt. This would be typical on any vehicle of this type though. It is recommended by Isuzu that the timing belt be changed at 50,000 miles. The clutch was just changed out about two months ago, so we got about 85,000 miles on the original. This is still not to bad when you consider that besides gas we have only spent a total of about $ 150.00 in maintenance since we bought this rugged beast. Bear in mind that this vehicle is with out a lot of bells and whistles that the SUV's now come with. This would be my only gripe if I had one about this truck. This truck is dependable, good on gas, low maintenance, and not to bad looking. We have three kids from age 5 down to 10 months and we all fit in with room to spare. This including three cars seats as we are very safe and by the book drivers. I would recommend this truck to any family starting out that dies not have a lot of money to spend and wants a good dependable but tough SUV. Also the � year does make a difference as the 95 did not have passenger side air bags and the 95� does. Consider this one a keeper....   <br><br>
