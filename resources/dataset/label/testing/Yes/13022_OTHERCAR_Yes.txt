            Volvo S80
Volvo has always brought to my mind the idea of safety and boring suburban smothering stodginess. I figured this would be my commuter car when I was in my forties. They were boxy and safe and rolled down the roads like yuppie tanks. Volvo owners seemed to feel that nothing was more important than their precious offspring cargo, added details like styling might indicate an engineer did not have safety top in mind. Then Volvo came out with a series of cars designed to attract a younger market segment. The first one was the C70 convertible, a lovely vehicle. The latest in this series is the S80. 
Impressions:

Exterior: The exterior has rounded edges! This may seem trivial, but heretofore Volvo designers seemed to have a toolbox that only had straight edges and now they seem to have sprung for a French Curve and a compass. The styling is muscular and reminiscent of the older Honda Accords, especially in the rear waterfall section of the car. As is typical, the paint and finish of the car is impeccable. 

Houston we have a problem!
Interior: Here Volvo really shines. The seats are superb. They are extremely large and comfortable and firm, they seem ideal for a long car ride. The instrument panel looks like one of the control consoles from the Apollo moon missions, tons of buttons and knobs that don't immediately reveal what they do. I had to stop to try to figure out how to turn on the heater. I had asked the sales person what the T.P button was for. &quot;Toilet paper?&quot; was his reply. I had a little better idea on the controls when I figured out that the climate control is actually divided into two sections, left for the driver and right for the passenger. It surprised me that two people might argue over temperature enough to need separate controls, and what good was that when sharing a 10 cubic foot area sharing the  heat/cool air? I had to remind myself that this car is from a history of cars designed for people in their 40s, who might very well have these kind of arguments. 

Performance:
The car is heavy and ponderous. It feels safe. It is not what I would call fast or agile. I am told the T6 version would be better. Driving is European, stiff and feeling every bump and rut in the road. 

Pricing:
This is a very expensive car! It starts out expensive and just gets stratospheric when you begin to add any level of options, sunroof, vehicle skid control, dynamic skid control, Navigation system, etc. 
	volvo s80
MSRP	        36000
Invoice	        33060
Destination 	575
Nav system	2140
auto	        0
leather	        960
stability control	880
scty	        480
Total	        $38,095
So  your pushing $40 grand without even adding that much to the car. The T6, which you will want for decent performance will push up that price another $6-7K. Too rich for me. 
Summary:
If you have children, or  an overly inflated estimation of the value of your own life, then I would recommend this car as the safest thing you can drive aside from military vehicles. The car is as luxurious as it should be for the price tag it comes with. Don't forget to factor in the heavy cost of repairing Volvos as well as the frequent down time they have while awaiting parts from far away. My next door neighbor has a S70 and it seems to always be in the shop.
