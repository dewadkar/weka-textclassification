            I have owned three trucks in my life, 1984 Toyota 2WD pickup (50,000 miles), 1986 Toyota 4-Runner (240,000 miles), and this 1998 Toyota 4WD Xtra-Cab Tacoma that I bought new in "98" (100,000 miles). I drive about 28,000 miles per year here in New England and use my vehicles to transport heavy equipment, materials then sometimes I head off into the woods for fun and 4-wheelin'. I have a manual 5-speed transmission and the 4-cylinder engine but I did upgrade the interior and got the power windows and door locks on the "98".

This 1998 with the 5-speed gets about 20-22mpg, always, without exception, highway, around town, etc. I don't beat up on my vehicles so maybe I'm short shifting a little but I am pleased with the mileage. None of my trucks have ever let me down and this one is no exception, always runs. It does not burn oil and I checked the original brakes 3/02 and they are still well within tolerance. My 1986 had a battery that lasted 8 years and so far after 4 years the Tacoma battery is fine. I do change my oil about every 3500 miles, and the filter every other oil change. I suspect that contributes to the longevity of the vehicle.

After 100,000 miles I have a few "sqwaks". In the cold weather (temperatures below freezing) there is a knocking sound when it starts but goes away after it warms up in a minute or two. The parking brake light will not go out (and yes, I did check the switch but it was OK. I think the harness shorted somewhere around the firewall feed-through.) There is a sqweaking noise coming from the dash when I drive on rough roads. I haven't found the source yet but I'll keep looking. And finally it does not handle rough roads or very tight curves that well. After all it is a pickup truck so that shouldn't be a big deal. Just remember that you're not driving a sports car, take turns a little slower, and everything will be OK.

Overall this truck is a workhorse. I recommend the 4-cylinder engine as they are indestructable and you don't have to change out the timing belt every 60,000 miles at $500.00+ a shot. You give up a little in acceleration but it's a pickup truck not a Ferrari! The smaller engine also gives you reasonable gas mileage and will haul anything you can fit in the bed, within the recommended specifications. The "backseat" of the Xtra-Cab is not suitable for adults on a long drive but it's ok for kids and will fit groceries and stuff that you want to keep warm and dry. The bed will take a full size road motorcycle but you'll probably have to take the tailgate off or leave it down. 

I love the truck and would recommend it to anyone.
