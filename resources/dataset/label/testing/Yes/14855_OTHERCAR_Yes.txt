            I bought my 1994 Firebird nearly 4 years ago and I still love this car.  It drives like a cruise missile, looks wonderful and has always been reliable.  So far, I've only had to replace the alternator and the catalytic converter. A stunning car when it's washed and polished and comfortable enough for a 3,600 mile road trip.

However, this car is not suited for wet or snowy climates.  I bought this in Detroit and... it didn't do well in Michigan winters.  Even with expensive snow tires, it couldn't get up a snow covered hill to save it's life.  I live in the Pacific Northwest now and it fishtails in the rain.  This is a dry climate car. 

It's also tough to tune up.  This particular engine has 3 sparkplugs seated WAY back and it's nearly impossible to get to them.  All of the rest of the maintainence and repairs I've done have been relatively easy, but... tune ups are rough. 

The hydraulic system in the hatchback squeaks and rattles.  It's not terrible, but in dead silence, it get annoying quickly.

Since this car just isn't great for the climate here, I'm getting a Jeep.  but, I'm really going to miss this car.  For a sports car, it's a tough little thing.
