            I owned two Corvettes prior to purchasing a Viper GTS/ACR in September 1999.  The Corvette is a superb sports car, but it does not come close to comparing to the Viper in terms of acceleration or handling.  In fact, nothing on the low side of $150,000 will outperform a Viper.

If you are single, extroverted, have plenty of money, and do not have kids to haul around, the Viper makes an excellent daily driver; it is nimble, quick, and easy to park.  Also, it is stunningly beautiful to look at and it draws a crowd at every gas station or grocery store parking lot.

The Viper has certain ergonomic weaknesses--for example, entry and exit requires negotiating a high door sill that gets hot because the exhaust is routed underneath it, and, also, the pedals are placed too close together and too far to the left--but, after you drive the Viper long enough, you will learn to accept these things as the price you pay for its truly astounding performance.  On the plus side, the seats are comfortable and supportive and the climate controls and stereo system are excellent.<br><br>
