            I've been the proud owner of my Saturn LS-1 for about 10 months now. This is not my first Saturn. Almost exactly a year before we bought this car we had purchased an SL, with which we were quite pleased. At the time, the dealer had given us information on the new LS series that was in the planing stages. My wife was intrigued, and when the larger Saturns became available we ended up trading in the SL for an LS. The service from Saturn has always been top notch. 

It was a wise decision. With three kids, the spacious LS makes our trips to see Grand dad in Philadelphia much more manageable. There's plenty of room for the kids in the back seat, and the increased trunk space allows me to haul home more great Pennsylvania beer, Tastykakes, scrapple, and soft pretzels. The CD sound system is impressive and satisfies this old audiophile quite nicely. Rear and front speakers in the doors allow for an even distribution of sound to all passengers. 

We chose the 4 cylinder model, and it provides the perfect combination of good mileage and peppy performance. It's the perfect family car, but it's also a pleasure to drive. I've often run out of road before I've run out of desire to drive this car. It handles like a charm around the S-Curve and Thurbers Ave curve here on 95 in RI, the true test of any vehicle. 

The little extras are here too: the humongous glove compartment, the removable rubber cup holder insert that makes for easy cleaning, the magazine racks on the doors, the rear seat cigarette lighter, the fold down back seats that allow you to carry long objects in the trunk, the fold down bucket seats.

Down sides? I've only come across two so far. There's a gauge that is supposed to tell you when the oil needs to be changed, it has never been very accurate. The front brakes spout black powder all over the wheel covers, I've seen this on a few other LS's too. Small details though, and although I'm no auto expert, I know what I like and what's good for my family. This car is it.<br><br>
