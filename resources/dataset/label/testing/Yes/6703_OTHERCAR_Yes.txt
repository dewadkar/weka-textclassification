            Being a salesman on the road 4 days of the week, I need a very dependable, comfortable, mid-size car.  I choose the Chevy Lumina because I wanted something different than most other salesmen's choice. (Ford Taurus).  No doubt about it...I picked the right car.  

I went with the &quot;fully-loaded package; V-6, power windows, power locks, AM/FM/Cassette, anti-lock brakes.  The warranty was 25,000 miles bumper to bumper.  The only mechanical problem I've had with this car was a snapped accelerator cable at 15,000 miles which was covered under the warranty.  I dropped my car off at the dealer and they provided me a rental for the day.  I haven't had one mechanical problem since.

The stereo has a really neat feature that adjusts the volume as the road noise increases.  The engine is a powerful V-6 and I was surprised when I figured out my gas mileage...I'm averaging 28 MPG on the highway using regular unleaded.  

The car is just shy of 100,000 miles and I haven't had any problems since the accelerator cable snapping.  I take it in for regular service (about 3,000 miles for oil changes, etc.) and I just changed the serpentine belt.  It actually didn't need to be changed; it looked fine. No cracking what-so-ever but Chevy recommends that it be changed every 60,000 miles.  I figured I was pushing it at 100,000.  

Overall, the car is an outstanding choice.  It seats 6 as opposed to 5 by most mid-size cars.  The handling and acceleration is much better than I had expected; and style...it definitely has style.  

My only complaints with this car are replacement parts cost.  I broke one of my headlights and had to replace the entire housing.  I check all of the auto parts stores for the headlight but the only place it was available was from the dealer...a whooping $236.00 FOR A HEADLIGHT.  Then it cost me another $50 to have someone install it. (It required special tools which I didn't own.) The other problem with the car is the placement of the ashtray.  It is placed under the dashboard and when it is extended you only have about an inch and a half of space between the dash and the ashtray to flick your ashes.  Needless to say...the carpet just below the ashtray has several burn marks

But with 100,000 miles...I have no serious complaints. You get more for the price of this car than can be expected.  I expect to get at least 200,000 miles from this car.

UPDATE:  I now have 135,000 miles on this car and I had a minor breakdown. The alternator died while I was on the Major Degan Expressway just outside of the Bronx. (Not the greatest neighborhood to break down in).  But I can't complain...this happened somewhere around 125,000 miles. That's longer than most alternators last.  Other than that I still haven't had any major problems.  I just had it in for a service and everything is in good shape.  No oil leaking, AC still works fine and the engine still has just as much power as when I bought it.  Best of all I don't have &quot;Firestone&quot; tires.<br><br>
