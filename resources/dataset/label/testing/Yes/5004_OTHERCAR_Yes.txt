            I admit freely cobbing my opinion's title from a well-known auto publication, but I feel that this is the best description available for this vehicle.  My other auto review concerned my 1996 Mercury Mystique.  Sadly, this reliable car became a victim of new-car fever.  I am now a proud owner of a 2001 Nissan Sentra SE.

Style

The Sentra was re-designed for 2000.  I don't consider it's body a fashion statement.  Compared to it's competitors, I think it's more luxury-oriented than anything under $20,000 save a base VW Jetta.  The exterior is very much Maxima, and I think it gets the job done without flair.  It's not going to be mistaken for a Bimmer.  Inside, the Sentra is roomy, and the controls are well-designed.  The hard plastics can get tiresome.  Fit and finish is excellent; much better than my old Mystique's. Creaks or rattles are not evident.  However, the Firestone tires can become loud on bad pavement.  Wind noise is generally muted; about on par with the Mystique.

Power

Ah, what a few more horsepower can do!  My Mystique had 125 ponies in it's 2.0L DOHC four.  While adequate, this amount of power simply was disappointing.  Well, the Sentra SE has a very responsive 145 pony 2.0L DOHC four.  There is no comparison.  This car can really get up and go, even with an automatic.  Most of the power resides in the middle and high RPM ranges, but for an economy car this level of performance is more than satisfying.

Handling and Steering

Another strong point of the Sentra is the well-tuned chassis.  Designed for the enthusiast in mind, the suspension on the SE features a more aggressively tuned suspension than the base model: stiffer springs, and firmer shocks.  Further improving handling, the package includes 16 inch tires; a rarity in this class.  Steering is very balanced, neither leaning towards light or heavy action; it can be a bit numb at times, but on bad roads this is a virtue.  On center feel is excellent.  Stability in cross winds is not a strong point, due to the unexceptional drag coefficient, but it's tolerable.  Just don't take your hands off the steering wheel for very long!

Ride

Probably the most important consideration for me is ride quality.  I don't like to be bounced around on the way to work.  The ride in the Sentra SE is sporty without being too harsh.  It can be a bit jarring on pock-marked pavement, but here in sunny southwest Florida that is not a problem.

Safety

ABS is not standard.  To me, this is the biggest drawback in the economy sedan class.  You usually have to pay extra for this essential feature.  I couldn't find a Sentra SE with ABS anywhere in my immediate area, and I didn't want to order one.  So I got stuck with the standard four wheel disc brakes.  These brakes bite well.  Still, I think this is an issue that all automakers should address in their future re-designs.  Driver and passenger side airbags are standard.

Value

I leased my Sentra SE for $291 a month for 36 months with no money down.  This included my trade, a 1996 Mercury Mystique GS with 60,000 miles.  I think I got an acceptable deal, and you may be able to do better.  I hate negotiations.  The only car I think is better than the Sentra SE is a VW Jetta 1.8T.  But you will be hard-pressed to get a good deal, at least in Florida, as these cars sell like hotcakes.  The Civic is an option, but I feel it's re-design has lowered this car's image.  The Ford Focus is butt-ugly, and unreliable to boot.  

For me, the 2001 Nissan Sentra SE is a winner.  It combines reliable transportation with a big fun factor thrown in for good measure.  If you can afford a VW, by all means go for it.  The Sentra is the car for the rest of us.
