            I have a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan, and I can honestly say I love it.  I may be considered a little biased, as this is the third Caravan I have owned.  We recently traded in our 1990 model for the 1997 model.  My main reason for trading up was the safety issue.  Our 1990 model did not have shoulder restraints in the rear seats, or airbags in the front seats.  The 1997 model has both of these features, along with an additional sliding rear door.  When they first introduced the second sliding door, I wasn't really impressed, but now that I have it, I don't know how I lived without it!  It's really helpful to have a second door when three kids need to get out!

Another safety feature I appreciate is the automatic door locks . . . when the accelerator reaches 15 mph, all doors lock automatically.  Again, not a huge thing, but a nice feature.

I've only been driving this car for about 2 months, so I haven't encountered any problems yet, but I know that our 1990 was still going strong, with 90,000 miles on it, so I anticipate driving this car for a long time to come.<br><br>
