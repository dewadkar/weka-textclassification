            We bought this car used and with nearly 100K miles on it and it has served us beautifully for the year we've owned it. Not once has it needed a single repair. Visibility is excellent. Our daughter can sit in the back seat with no complaints about not being able to see out of the windows. There's a lot of storage space and room to transport carpoolers. We love the computerized readings for temperature, mpg and average mpg, and directional compass. It also has cruise control, a/c and push-button opener for the hatch-back door. As far as comfort is concerned, I rate it high, because it's the most comfortable car I've ever owned.

If I were to try to find something to complain about, I'd have to mention the slow power acceleration. But, then, this is not a sports car. Furthermore, we live in the mountains, and climbing those steep hills tends to lower the efficiency of our overall gasoline consumption. Finally, we were told when we bought the car that the back windshield wiper did not work and we've never tried to repair it. We just haven't really needed it--even in during the rainy season.
