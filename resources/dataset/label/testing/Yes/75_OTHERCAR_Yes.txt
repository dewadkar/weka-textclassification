            This van is good at what it is made to do- move people. It doesn't really accelerate that well, and the ride is really bumpy. But, that is the case in most 15-passenger vans. The legroom is about equal to the Ford E-series. The seats really aren't that comfortable and after about an hour and a half they really get uncomfortable. 

Our Ram Van had a V8 in it, but with 15 people, it was still a bit slow. It ran well on the interstate. At about 65 mph there was no shaking and the ride wasn't terribly loud. Most people aren't really worried about the ride because they are busy talking with their friends, this makes the ride seem more enjoyable. For a driver, the controls aren't placed in the best of places, but they are sufficient. The Ford Van has shoulder seat belts for occupants at both ends of the seats, but the Ram only has one shoulder belt per row. Only two or three of the windows open, which does make it hotter and they only crack open. There are A/C vents at each row of seats, but they are on one side, about knee high, so they don't circulate very much. There are no backseat controls either so you have to constantly yell upfront to change the temperature. 

The radio is horrible. There are only speakers upfront, so to hear the radio in the back, the driver has to blast the volume. This usually results in the backseat passengers not being able to hear anything. 

I would recommend the Ram Van for church groups, etc. Its best characteristics are its ability to carry 15 people. It isn't real spacious or comfortable, but it isn't much worse than a Ford or GM. I do like the rear climate controls on the Ford and the overhead vents. All of them have about the same legroom and are just as hard to exit. The Ram has one large door to open the back, which is a little difficult to open in a crowded area or in a parallel parking space. It is an easy way to get into the backseat though.

The seats aren't really terrible, but they aren't comfortable for an hour- maybe 20-30 minutes. And it's not really the seats as much as the seating space. <br><br>
