            I bought the Tiburon because I know it is a car that is not common in Ohio, especially in Columbus.  I drive all around the town and I have yet to see another 2000.  I get stares in the city and on the interstate.  I commonly hear &quot;nice Honda&quot; because people glance at the slanted H on the grill and assume it is a wacked out Civic.  I love this car for it's head on looks as well as it's profile.  It has every option on a sports car you could ever want.  The stainless steel exhaust provides a nice throaty sound that reminds me a baby mustang.  The cockpit is very futuristic and compatible.  The worst thing about the 2000 Tiburon is the seat design.  I felt they are very &quot;Austin Powerish&quot;.  They look like a set a drapes my aunt has in her house.  Of course I could have opted for leather, but the leather design really isn't much better and it costs about $1000 more!  The tires, Oy Vey!, are too damn skinny!  The Tiburon boast a &quot;sport-tuned&quot; suspension, but what good is that if the tires won't grip the road?  The tiburon can have a bad temper. Especially if it has been sitting all night and you want to leave in the morning in a hurry.  It is very sluggish until that temperature gauge has a chance to wake up.  To drive the Tiburon however is something only thought of in fairy tales.  It can out handle just about anything thrown at you and at very high speeds.  The day I bought my car, I took it on Interstate 70 East and immediately zoomed up to 123mph.  I wanted to stick with it longer, but I did not want to go to jail.  The Tiburon's high-end power is where it is at.  Getting the RPM's above 4200 is when this land shark begins to attack.  My best advice would be to drive this car like you hate it and then you will begin to love it!  Anyone who enjoys affordable performance and outlandish styling should purchase a Tiburon.  Anyone who does not like constant comments and stares should buy an eclispe<br><br>
