            It can be hard to convert a Toyota fan into a Honda fan.  It was not an easy switch especially when one's life was protected by side airbags installed in the 1999 Toyota Corolla.  But when my wife saw the 2000 Honda Civic 4 door, she knew that she had to have one of them.  We test drove many of them before she settled down for an LX. So far, it has been providing us with lots of joy.  At first, I wanted to go with a 2000 Honda Civic 2 door hatchback, but with two children, the 4 door would make her life easier when it comes to load and unload car seats and other errands.  

<b>Models and features</b>

The 2000 Honda Civic 4 door comes in two body styles, coupe and Sedan and in four models:  DX, HX, LX and EX.  They are powered by a 1.7-liter,overhead-cam, four-cylinder engine.  Now, depending on the model, the engine power may vary.  This is why the LX and DX are rated at 115 horsepower while the HX has a 1127 and the EX, (top-of-the line) has 127 horsepower.  While I test-drove the LX, I found it to be very receptive to my acceleration.  The drive was smooth as I continued to press on the gas pedals.  

The 2000 Honda Civic 4 door has a great interior.  Its exterior comes in black, gray, and other colors.  Since the test-drive occurred during the Summer months, we checked the air conditioning to find out it worked.  The buttons are so large that nobody can miss them.  There was a sudden and steady rush of cool air coming out of the vents.  For the whole drive, we forgot that we were in the middle of the Summer season.  The speedometer and tachometer are well placed.  You can't miss them either.  I specially like the supply of light they provide while driving at night time.

<b>Large trunk to carry groceries and carry gear and necessary items</b>

In addition to the rear seats that can fold forward, the 2000 Honda Civic comes with a large trunk.  It also comes with power windows, mirrors and door locks. There are some options you can choose:  remove keyless entry and more.

<b>The only downside:  No side-air bags!</b>

I wish that the 2000 Honda Civic was equipped with side air-bags.  After all, they can make the difference between life and death in a side collision.

If you are looking for a great little car, the 2000 Honda Civic 4 door is a good choice.  So far, my wife has enjoyed hers.  If you have children who are attending school in a different city, you may want to purchase one for them.  And if you need a reliable vehicle for your commute to work, the 2000 Honda Civic is the answer to your transportation problems.<br><br>
