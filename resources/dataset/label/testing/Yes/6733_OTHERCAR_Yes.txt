            I own a Honda Accord and find it to be one of the finest made automobiles within it's price range.  It's 10 years old with 150,000 miles and it still runs like it's brand new!  I own the 4-door Sedan and it is my second Accord.In my &quot;e&quot;pinion, the '90 to '93 Accords were the best built.  They feel heavier and not as &quot;tinny&quot; as the new models.  I recently got a raise at work, and while most people would say their dream car is a Mercedes or BMW, mine is the 2000 Civic SI.  Figure that out!I've had little to no mechanical problems with the car (scheduled mantenaince is always performed). The most major problem that I've had is the molding around a door handle cracked.  If you can find a car that has had no mechanical problems in a decade, you found a great car.I would recommend anyone looking for a fun, reliable car that with scheduled maintences performed will give you 200,000 miles (or more) to buy a Honda or Acura.  You won't find a better car for the money.  (Remember some Honda SUV's are atually Isuzu's!)  My decade-old car still gives me more than 300 miles to a tank!<br><br>
