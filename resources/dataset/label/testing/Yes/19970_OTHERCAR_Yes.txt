            Model reviewed: Extended cab 3 door, 4800 V8, Automatic, SLE trim, 2WD. 6' bed.

The 1999 Sierra was my first full-size pickup after moving up from a Ford Ranger. So far it has been a good performer except for a few annoyances. My truck is truly a "gentlemen's pickup" as the bed doesn't get frequent or hard use in my case.

The third door is on the passenger side, which I think is inconvenient. If you are traveling solo and have a briefcase or bag, you must walk around the truck to access the rear seat. In 2000, a fourth door on the drivers side was added as an option. If I knew this was coming the following model year I would have postponed my purchase to a 2000 model. The rear door is larger than a Ford F-150 though, and allows decent access to the fold-up rear seat.

My major gripe with the GMC is the drivetrain. Since I don't tow anything or carry heavy loads, I opted for the Vortec 4800 V8 (245hp) since it had plenty of pep during the test drive. But in everyday driving it has a tendency to ping slightly on regular fuel. Also, it has a worrisome knock immediately when turned over to start. The dealer has checked these problems twice but assured me everything is "normal". During one visit they updated the computer program for the engine driveability & shift points. This improved the pinging somewhat but I still need to run the truck on 89 octane fuel. Fuel economy is decent-- if I can stay out of freeway gridlock I can average around 20 mpg-- good for a vehicle of this size and weight. From talking to other GM truck owners I hear that the 4800 engine is a cousin of the old GM 305 V8, which was considered a dog. My recommendation is to get the 5300 V8 if at all possible.

GM has always been known for silky smooth transmissions and here the GMC disappoints once again. If the gas is applied when coasting at 5-15mph (say in slow traffic) the driveline will seem to "clunk". Also, sometimes at low speeds the transmission seems to slip or not know what gear it wants. Again, these conditions are worrisome but the dealer says they are "normal". Hopefully any serious problem will show up before the warranty ends.

On the road, the GMC rides well, especially at highway speeds. There is, however, more engine and road noise inside the cabin than there should be for a truck at this price range & trim level. Handling and braking are competent and what you would expect for a vehicle this size- in other words, be careful in tight spots.

My truck has the SLE trim level with cloth captain's chairs, including fold-down armrests and a huge center console. The interior of the Sierra functions well. The captains chairs are comfortable and I have emerged after 12 hours behind the wheel with no backache. There are many cubby holes for storage although a few are shaped unusually. The overhead console also has a couple of small storage bins and a spot for your garage door opener, although this relies on Velcro to hold your opener in place and doesn't work very well. A Homelink system would be a welcome upgrade. The rear seat has adequate legroom if the front seats are slid forward a little, but folding up the rear cushion requires an awkward downward pull on a flimsy webbed strap that hangs from the cushion bottom, while pulling up on the cushion. Seems like a better design could have been made. Adults will probably want to occupy the rear seat for short trips only, but kids would be OK. The seat back is pretty upright and the bottom cushion short, but this is to be expected. The rear seats do have their own AC & heat vents however, which is a nice touch. The plastic used on the dash,console, and interior surfaces seems cheap and flimsy, however. 

Some of the controls on the Sierra have their own quirks. The door locks will lock themselves automatically when you reach about 10 mph. But, when you turn off the engine, you must hit the "unlock" button to unlock the doors; they will not open from the inside if you lift the door handle like some other cars. I realize that this is a security feature but unusual nonetheless. Also, the radio and some of the other power accessories stay on even after you shut off the engine and remove the key. They only shut off when you pull on the door handle to get out. I guess this is useful if you like to turn off the vehicle and sit in it listening to the radio but it seems strange to me.

Overall the GMC has been a good vehicle and receives a lot of compliments on its looks. During my purchase I did not really look at the virtually identical Chevy Silverado as the local dealer did not have any selection. The Chevy may be a tad cheaper and have a few minor trim variances, but it is pretty much a matter of taste on styling of the GMC vs. the Chevy. When I bought this vehicle new in 1999, it was rated higher than the competition by Consumers Reports. Now, I see that as a used vehicle it is rated as somewhat repair prone. In retrospect, I should have probably checked out the Ford F-150 much closer as maybe the drivetrain would be better. I recommend that you compare the competition unless you have a strong brand loyalty to GM- I don't--- but I know alot of truck buyers do.
