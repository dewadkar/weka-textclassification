            I have owned my 1995 Jeep Cherokee Country since it's birth in late 1994. And in that time, though the car has been for the most part reliable, I have had my problems.

I bought this car mainly because I needed a new car and wanted a sport ute.  I looked at the Chevrolet Blazer, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Ford Explorer.  Though all three are nicer (less truck feeling) than the Cherokee Country, the Cherokee Country was much cheaper and more in my price range.

The fit and finish of the car is was and still is good for the most part.  There were a few rattles from day one and over the last 5 years, the car has gotten more (for example, the driver's door hinge now make a loud noise when you go to close it.)

My Cherokee is equipped with Jeep's 4.0 High-Output I-6 that has been around for years (I believe but am not sure that it might even be a carry over from the old AMC days, however I could be wrong).  For a I-6 (that now has 103,000 miles) it still has some get up and go.  The car still gets really good gas mileage too! (about 300 to the tank full in the city).  My brother-in-law as a 1983 Cherokee with the same engine and it has over 300,000 miles on it! (Just don't back the tailgate into a tree, very expensive to fix, right Jim?)

As I stated above it does have more of a &quot;truck&quot; feel to it both sitting in it and driving it.  But the thing WILL go anywhere!  The stiffer ride is not as nice as the other, more expensive Sport Utes.  But it still is a nice ride.

I have had a few problems with my Jeep.  Two that really stick out are as follows:

-Had to replace the ignition switch.  Was traveling down the interstate here in Omaha during rush hour when the car just turned off.  Car wouldn't restart.  Ended up replacing the ignition switch (about $120 at my local Jeep dealer).

-Have had SEVERAL fluid leaks repaired under the car.  Those leaks included an oil leak from a gasket that went bad.  A transmission fluid leak in the rear differential that leak down both sides of the rear axle and made the back break pads no good.

I do plan on keeping my Jeep several more years and hope to get 200,000 miles out of it.<br><br>
