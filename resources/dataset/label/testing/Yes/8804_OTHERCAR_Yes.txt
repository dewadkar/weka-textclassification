            If you like Honda's, you will love this new 2000 Honda Accord LX.  If you've thought about buying a Honda, and haven't, this would be a good year to do so.

Having owned 2 Hondas before this one, it was easy to make educated comparisons.  The dash has been re-vamped as of last year and one of the better features is the increase in horse power from 130 to 150.  It may not seem like much, but it is certainly noticeable when trying to enter the highways in New Jersey!  The car has been raised in the back for better aerodynamics and gives the car the appearance of being larger than the previous Accords.

I like the fact that there is a lumbar support, but I'm not crazy about the knobs on the side of the seat.  They are a bit cumbersome to use.

Another thing that keeps Honda buyers coming back is the bang for your buck.  You can get the Honda Accord LX with auto alarm and trunk opener, tack on a 100,000 mile extended warranty with lots of perks, and still pay only around $22,000.<br><br>
