            This is the best digital camera you can buy for under $300. I just purchased one of these and I love it. This camera produces high quality resolution pictures and I have not had any problems with it. This camera produces crisp pictures and I think it takes better pictures than other higher priced digital cameras.  Hewlett Packard is the best computer company and I only buy from them. Moderately priced with all the accessories you need to get you started!!  So go out and buy another great Hewlett Packard product.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a great digital camera and not a hit in the wallet.<br><br>
