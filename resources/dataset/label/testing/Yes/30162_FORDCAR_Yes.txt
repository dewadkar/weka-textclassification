            A little more than ten years ago, my father was in an automobile accident.  His car was damaged beyond repair and the family was left with only one car.  With two people working, we had no choice but to look for another car.  At first, my family started looking at used cars.  We had no luck and found nothing but lemons.  Finally, we decided to splurge and go for a new car.  We found the Festiva.

At first glance, our small, grey car with a red stripe down the side looks much like an over sized child's toy.  The only thing missing is the key to wind it up and let it go.  But that is only what the outsider sees.  Anyone who knows &quot;The Festiva&quot;, knows that there is much more to the story.

This car has passed the test of time.  Almost ten years old, &quot;The Festiva&quot; has seen more road action than Joe Montana has seen Super Bowl quarters.  Every weekday for those ten years, our car has made the forty minute trip to and from my father's work place.  One might think that the car may get a break after this workout.  No, there are still baseball and soccer and football and almost any other game with a ball (and some without) to attend.  There are kids to be shuttled.  There is food to be picked up.  No, &quot;The Festiva&quot; sees no rest.  It works tirelessly and never complains.  Around town, everyone knows it.  It is a mark of the family.  It gets its awards in the recognition of the citizens.  It needs nothing else but some gas and an occasional bath.

There is nothing spectacular about &quot;The Festiva&quot;.  No AC, no CD player, only two doors.  None of this matters.  The seats are dark and worn from ground in dirt.  It takes a little coaxing to get up in the cold winter mornings.  But still it goes on.  Never complaining, always performing.  To drive &quot;The Festiva&quot; is great thing.  It goes smooth enough.  The clutch doesn't stick.  The brakes work.  It has decent pickup.  It gets the job done.

Who should buy this?  I don't know, I guess someone looking for a car that might last a while.  Someone looking for a car to get the dirty work done.  Someone looking for a car to give them some memories.
