            This review applies to the first generation Saturn.

Before I got married my wife (to be) purchased a 1995 Saturn SL1, brand new.  At first glance, I didn't think much of the car.  I figured it was just another small GM offering, with questionable build quality, and years behind the rest of the industry.  Man was I wrong!

I've had 5 years of driving the Saturn, and every new day brings more appreciation for this car.  Lets start with the build quality.  The fit and finish on the car is light years ahead of any other GM of the day.  It is slightly behind the Japanese cars in fit and finish.  The body panels come together nicely on this car, there are no huge gaps.  The interior build quality is excellent and well laid out.  My biggest beef with the interior is that once you switch the rear defogger on, it can't be switched off, until it does so automatically.  For the class of car, the seats are firm, and finding a comfortable seating position is easy, even for big folks. (I'm 6'1&quot;, 250lb).  

Exterior styling of the first generation Saturns is &quot;sportier&quot; than the second.  It is tasteful, and not some &quot;Civic&quot; knock off.  The durability of the polymor body panels is amazing, and conceal the bumps of shopping carts.  

Now to the biggest sore spot:  The engine.
The base engine in the car is grossly under powered, and far too loud.  I realize that people don't buy these cars to win drag races, but the car needs more passing power.  And GM should have better insulated the cabin for engine noise.  Saturns also are notorious for having loud brakes.  I have tried at numerous places to alleviate the loud rubbing sound the brakes make when cold, and everywhere I take the car, from the dealership to Midas, to my local mechanic tell me that it is something you just have to live with.

In summary, the beefs are just not that big.  The car in incredibly versatile, it provides excellent value, and gas mileage.  The car is pleasant to look at, and is a comfortable car.  I just can't stop thinking how good a car this is.  We've had ours since it was new in '95, and the repairs have been quite minimal.  These are fabulous cars, with awesome service backing them up at the dealership.<br><br>
