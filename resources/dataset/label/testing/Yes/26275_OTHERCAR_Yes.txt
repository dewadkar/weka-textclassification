            Now I don't actually own one of these, but I know several people who do, and I contemplated the idea but decided I didn't need to be that much in debt at 19.  If it weren't for the price, which is pretty reasonable about 17,000 for a 2000 model, I definitely would have bought one of these cars.  They are so incredible for a just a 4-cylinder car.  The V-tech on this car though is what really makes it great.  If you are unfamiliar with what V-Tech is, it's similar to a turbo charger but within the engine.  At certain RPM's the V-tech kicks in and the car just flies.  There is a good article on this car in the October 99 issue of the magazine Sport Compact Car and a follow up in the most recent issue, I'm not advertising for the magazine by any means so please don't take it that way.  There about a zillion options on these cars, whether from the factory or aftermarket, and they are all relatively inexpensive and very easy to find.  I own a Toyota, and an 88 at that and i wish parts were as easy to find on my car as they are on Honda's.  The car really doesn't need anything aftermarket to get performance out of it which is great, they are just a blast, in fact the only Honda to beat my Toyota Supra Turbo to date that i've raced is one of these new civic Si's, granted it was all tricked out though and mine is stock.  Even if you don't have the means to purchase one of these, at least go and test drive one and don't be afraid to stomp on it and open it up.<br><br>
