            <b>Introduction</b>
I bought this car in 1999 from a co-worker, partly to help him out of a jam, but mainly because it had such impressive lines and unique clean, trim look. This is the Super-Coupe version, which has a supercharged 3.1 L V-6, and independent rear suspension.

<b>What I like</b>
This car is fun to drive. It handles nicely, with electronic shocks automatically which firm up the ride when you flip a switch or exceed 65 MPH. 

The mileage is respectable, at least 20 MPG most of the time, and this car has good jam when you need it. The supercharger is well-protected from overboost by providing the driver with a combination vacuum/boost gauge, and a warning light which asks you do ease off the gas when you push it too much. The supercharger gives you more immediate boost compared to a turbocharged engine. Unlike the turbo, the supercharger belt-driven and is always running at full speed, but not drawing power from the engine, because it is running in a vacuum most of the time. Stepping on the gas opens a diverter valve at the back of the engine, allowing the blower to instantly provide boost to the engine when needed.

This car feels solid, strong and sleek. Lots of nice luxury features, a two-way sunroof, a multi-way adjustable seat for driver and passenger, and real leather seats to name a few.

<b>What I don't like</b>
This car is expensive to repair. It has lots of exotic parts that have their own special price-range.  For example, the serpentine belt and tighteners are a special high-speed, high-tension type that costs a lot and in my experience, they don't last any longer than the conventional, cheaper ones.

The car has 145,000 kms on it, and it has already had a new transmission, rear differential, water pump, head gaskets, and who knows what else, I bought it used.

This car is almost useless on ice, snow, and can be dangerous on a wet road. Too much of the weight is on the front end. I found it necessary to install a 150 lb steel plate in the trunk for ballast.

<b>Conclusion</b>
Overall, I love this car for all its faults. The T-bird Super-coupe has a strong following and several clubs exist. It was also MotorTrend Car of the Year in 1989.
