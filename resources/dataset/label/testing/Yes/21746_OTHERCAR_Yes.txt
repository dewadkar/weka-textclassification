            I bought a 1998 Cavalier in used condition (an ex-rental car that appeared to be relatively well maintained) in July of 1999.  I decided to get the car, since I was looking for something that I knew would get good gas mileage, compared to the 10-mile-per-gallon vintage 1981 Oldsmobile gas guzzler I was slipping by on before.  The car had 54,000 miles on it, and now has about 74,000.  (Yeah, I drive a lot, mostly for recreational purposes.)  

Indeed, the car has been fine for the most part... recently, it has needed new brakes all around (not surprising, who knows how many &quot;brake pedal riders&quot; drove the car in its rental incarnation), new tires... and pretty much nothing else, except for the religiously applied regular maintenance.  It runs solid, feels like I could drive forever.  

The only qualms that I've found is that, while it seems to drive down the road fine, it sure can't handle the bigger bumps too well.  You feel them pretty well in your seat.  Maybe I'm just yearning for what I've felt in other cars... where you practically don't feel a thing.  Also, it seems that the car is starting to develop some of the squeaks and rattles that I've seen mentioned in other reviews.  So far, nothing that I'm worrying about, it's fairly trivial.  I wish that there wasn't quite as much road and engine noise, particularly at speeds of 55 and over... makes it hard sometimes to hear my passengers.  I've been in similiar class cars and things were a bit quieter (but, at least the Cavalier is quieter than the Kia Sephia I recently drove.  That's a whole 'nother review (sometime).)

I'd say that someone who wants basic, reliable transportation could buy the car, probably more suited for in-the-town sorts of things, with the occasional highway trip possible.  Indeed, it doesn't seem to cost much to operate the vehicle, and repair costs seem moderate to relatively inexpensive...<br><br>
