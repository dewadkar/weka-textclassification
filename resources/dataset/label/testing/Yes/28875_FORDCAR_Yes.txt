            The 2000 Ford Explorer XLT is easy to like and easy to drive. This is our first SUV. After last winter's snow, we decided that a four-wheel drive would give us safer traction if we got similar snows this year. We are prepared for whatever comes.

My wife would not drive my beloved 1988 Ford Crown Victoria station wagon because she thought it was too big and hard to handle. However, she finds the new Explorer has a short turning radius and she loves to drive it.

We love the automatic door locks and have even come to appreciate the moon roof. However, the moon roof was not on our buy list. Rather, it came preloaded on the car as did a six-CD changer which we could have done without. Again, we like it now that we have it, but we feel it is a luxury that we don't really need.

The 2000 Explorer has more road noise than our 88 Crown Victoria station wagon. In fact, it is not clear whether the four-wheel drive contributes to the added noise even when it is not engaged (which is all the time at the present).

We wish that the CD would randomly select CD as our home CD player does. It appears to only randomly select tracts on the current CD.

According to my wife, the rear shoulder belt does not provide a reasonable amount of slack as does the front shoulder belts. As a result, the rear shoulder belts are not as comfortable
