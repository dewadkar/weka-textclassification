            I owned a Honda Accord from the first year that it came out in 1998 with the newer body style.  After having driven my friends 1995 Honda Accord, I can say that this is a much better vehicle than its forebearer.  The only reason I got rid of this car was I moved up to a Lexus.

The overall handling and poise of this vehicle is great.  The car handles well in any situation.  Performance in rain and snow is very good.  Acceleration is very good, especially considering it is a 4-cylinder engine.  I have always said that Honda makes some of the best 4-cylinder engines, and after driving this car, it's easy to see why.  Being a 4-cylinder, it is loud.  But, you have great fuel economy.  The 4-speed auto transmission shifts smoothly, and has a nice tendency to hold the car at a constant speed while going down hills.

Interior space is excellent.  The trunk is mammoth, and even the rear seat room with the front seats all the way back is still very acceptable.  The seats and driving position are very comfortable.  Plenty of storage space is also in the car.  The ergonomics of the dash are some of the best that I have ever seen.  The stereo is also very good for a stock radio in this class, and in some ways, is better than that of my friends BMW.  The ventilation controls are top-notch.  I felt that the A/C was a little underpowered (but I like it very cold), but the heating was excellent.  Nice touches are all around, such as the speed-sensitive variable intermittent wipers, and lockout protection (prevents you from locking the doors with the car off while leaving the key in the ignition).

Overall, this is a very good car.  About the only problem that I had with it was noise, from the engine, wind and road.  Since it is a Honda, you know that it is reliable.  If you are in this price range, I would recommend this vehicle highly.  Much more sportier than the Camry, but for less money.<br><br>
