            I just got my 2000 Mercury Mystique LS about 3 weeks ago and I love it! Mine is fully loaded except for the traction control and the cd changer.  I'm a college student and the value this car represents simply can't be beat.  After negotiations and the rebate, I walked off the lot with my car for 16,133.  My car has the no cost leather and moonroof, fog lights, ABS, power driver's seat, spoiler, Alarm, 15&quot; alloy wheels, automatic , keyless entry and the 2.5 V6.  Add to this great gas mileage and what more could you ask for at this price?A similarly priced Focus doesn't come with ABS, a v6, Leather, or a moonroof.  The Focus was my only other serious choice and when I found out that one optioned to my liking would cost me 15,550 without all of this stuff I couldn't say no to the Mystique.  I'm 6'5 and I fit comfortably in the driver's seat especially with the help of the 6-way power adjustment that is standard on the LS.  Perhaps more than anything else, I love the way my car handles and rides.  Since I've gotten my car, I've put to shame a few car and suv drivers who didn't know about the mystique's performance.  The steering is well weighted and very accurate.  The automatic transmission performs flawlessly and doesn't hunt for gears even up steep hills.  The engine is smooth and has no problem running strong well past average speeds. And the sounds it makes! Simply wonderful! The headlights are strong and light the road well.  I love the front styling but the rear is just ok.  Looks better with the spoiler thoough.  The woodgrain trim adds a nice air to the interior as well.  Ergonomics are as good as any I've come across so far. The suspension hugs corners and curves while still providing an exceptional ride.  This car is far more exciting than a Corolla, Civic or Saturn dreams of being.  Everything seems to fall into hand just fine for me.  I have had no problems with the front cupholders at all...they hold every drink I've gotten so far.  This car seems to do everything I ask of it with ease.No trips back to the dealer yet either.  Only things I don't like so far is headroom in the back seat is a little tight...but its not as bad as others like Sentra.  The brakes are wonderful with the ABS, but I wish they were discs in the back instead of drums.  Also, the CD Player is good, but the speakers could be better.  I'll probably end up replacing them.This is my first new car and I'm loving every minute of it.  Don't underestimate the Mystique: It's really a great car.  I'm not the only one to think so apparently; there are clubs for just Mystiques and Contours.  If you ask me, GET A MYSTIQUE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!! NO MORE AFTER 2000 AND WHAT'S ON THE DEALER LOTS IS IT!!!<br><br>
