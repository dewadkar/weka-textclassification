            Not only a great car to drive, but also fun. I purchased a '97 wrangler and fell in love with it the first day. 
The car is easy to handle has great torque and can go almost anywhere off road. Also the car is compact which makes it more easier to drive rather then those big huge cars. In the summer time my son especially likes the car because he likes to take the top off and try to impress the ladies. The top is easy to store as well as all the other parts that detach. 
The one downside to this car is the gas mileage. My old camry would last a week maybe a week and a half on a full tank of gas. My jeep doesn't even last which takes money out of my pocket.<br><br>
