            <i>I am not a professional reviewer. This is not a professional review. If you want to know the technical definition of megapixels or exactly what crankers crank to make the zoom possible, you should probably look for a different review. =)</i>

I had wanted a digital camera for a really long time when I finally got one a few years ago for Christmas. I didn't really care what kind it was, just as long as it works and it takes pictures. Before I got this camera, I would sometimes find rolls of film in various places around my house and wonder what was on it. Now I don't have to go anywhere to get my pictures developed, and none of my pictures are floating around in LaLa Land never to be seen.

My parents bought the FujuFilm FinePix 2300 Digital Camera at Wal-Mart for about $200. I'm not sure how much the average digital camera costs, but I know that you can get little ones that don't do much for about $25 and big ones that do a lot for about $2500. 

It comes with an 8.0 MB SmartMedia card, which holds a different number of pictures according to how high you set the size and quality. The way that I have it set (lowest quality and size), it can hold up to 75 pictures. You can also buy extra cards if you are planning on going on vacation or anywhere where you want to take tons of pictures. The cards can hold between 8 MB and 64 MB. They are pretty expensive, though...I have seen some for up to $300, which is more than the actual camera costs!! 

I had to read the instruction book pretty carefully before I understood exactly what I could do with this camera. It is easy to learn how to take pictures, but it took me a while to figure out how to zoom in/out and set the timer. I'm not exactly what anyone would call an <i>electronics whiz</i>.

The camera comes with a cd-rom for the computer. You will need to install the cd in order to view the pictures on the computer. It also comes with a USB cord, which connects the camera to the computer. I think all digital cameras come with a different cord, because there are about 3 digital cameras at my house, and sometimes I have to try all of the cords before I find out which one goes with my camera. When you get the pictures onto the computer, they are automatically in JPEG format.  They seem to look better if I change them to bmp format right after I edit them. They look kinda <i>swirly</i> if I edit them and don&#146t change the format.

There is a little dial on the back of the camera, with 3 option modes. One is for setting the time, date, and file size. The second option is what you should be in while taking the picture. The third one is for looking at the pictures after they have already been taken. There is a place at the bottom where you can put it on a tripod stand. I have never done this, but it would be useful for setting the timer for a group picture and running over to join the group. 

The FujuFilm FinePix 2300 is a 2.1 mega pixel camera. The only thing I know about mega pixels is: The higher the number, the better the quality. Usually the more expensive cameras have a higher mega pixel number (The most expensive camera that Epinions has listed has 11.1 mega pixels). I hated when I had to use my scanner to get pictures onto my computer because when I enlarged it just a little bit, I could see big squares all over the picture, and it looked really choppy (3 squares for each eyeball). Now I can enlarge pictures as far as they will go without seeing any noticeable squares (a zillion squares for each eyeball. The default file size is 1,600 x  1,200 pixels, but you can change the size and quality in the "Set" menu.

The only problem I have with this camera is that I can't take surprise pictures of people. Sometimes I run up to <a href="/user-judge_reinhold">Adam</a> and click the button, hoping to get a "funny face" picture, but the camera takes forever to actually take the picture, so I get a "normal face" picture (Not that I don't love Adam's "normal face" pictures). =) It only actually waits about one second to take the picture, but that is still long enough time between the click and the flash for it to make me cranky. The digital camera world likes to call this "shutter lag".

The zoom feature would probably bother me if I cared about zooming in or out to take pictures. I don't ever use the zoom option, so it doesn't matter. There is no zoom lens. You have to click on display while you are in the "take pictures" mode and then click the up arrow in order to zoom. You pretty much have to look at the screen while you take the picture for this to work. That just doesn't work for me. I do use the "zoom in after you take the picture" option ("digital zoom")in "look at the pictures" mode, which is pretty cool.

There is not a lens cover, which bothers a lot of people. I don't really care about that, because it doesn't seem to mess up the pictures any.   

This camera uses 4 AA batteries. If you don't go crazy with it by keeping the power switch set to "on" for long periods of time, the batteries last quite a while. However, if you don't use your time wisely, the camera will devour your batteries. I learned this lesson <i>very</i> quickly. 

There is a screen on the back of the camera that shows you the picture after you take it. It is about 1.6 inches in length and width. While in the "show picture" mode, you can flip through all of the pictures, deleted whatever ones you don't like, zoom in and out, and "protect" certain pictures (which means that it won't let you delete them). There are several pictures that I accidentally deleted that I wish I would have "protected".

This camera is great for beginners, as long as you have plenty of time to read the instruction book. Professionals would probably want something that has better zoom options and that doesn't have shutter lag. If you want to see an example of a picture taken with this camera, there is one at the bottom of my profile page. =)
