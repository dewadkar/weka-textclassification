                  This is one of the best cars I have ever driven, and trust me, i've driven many. I believe this car to be one of the best cars for its money. I have had mine for about 4 years and it is still in perfect condition. This car is very reliable, has an excellent looking design that will not be out of fashion for a while, has great pick up and is a very smooth ride. I am very happy with my car. My mother has a 95 Lexus LS400 which literally costs twice as much as this car and it doesn't even come close to the CL. I would rather pick the CL over the Lexus at any time. 
      The only downside with this car is that it may sometimes be hard to enter and exit the backseat which is pretty cramped already, but then again, what do you expect from a two door? If it's just two people, then the ride is great with its Bose sound system that is just incredible. And especially for you guys out there, this ride is a serious chick magnet. No joke, i've had the most amazing girls just coming up to me and complementing my car. They all want rides and i'm always more than happy to give it to them. So basically, this is an excellent car for both girls and guys, but especially for you single guys out there. The ride is smooth, the pick up is great and it barely breaks down. I highly recommend it, but not for road trips of more than two people.
