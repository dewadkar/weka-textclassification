            I purchased my first Nissan, then Datsun, in 1973, by 1978 I was using only Nissan products personally and in my business.

I have owned the Datsun 510, Datsun 810, Nissan Sentra Wagon, Nissan King Cab 4x4 Pick up and several other models including the Nissan Pick up, straying only once, in 1993 to an American brand name. 

Upon returning to Nissan in 1998, I was disappointed in the quality of the Nissan Maxima, the air tight seals around the doors were gone, you used to open a window to close the door, no more.  We were also disappointed in the performance of the vehicle, I now suspect that the 200,000 miles of use for the vehicle may not be a reality, however, my decision was tempered by the fact that in the past, the Nissan product has been good for a minimum of 150,000 miles without a single problem, and the fact that when compared to the VW Pissant, the performance was almost as good.

The ride is good, the performance sufficient for my uses at a little above the speed limit, with good passing ability and good response to driving commands.  The room for driver and passenger are sufficient for my uses, and we have placed 50,000 comfortable miles on the vehicle in the past year, without problem.

I would recommend replacing the cheap Nissan supplied tires as soon as possible, although replacement of the cheap tires did not change the performance, stopping or ride standards, it was just a safety consideration.

The interior seems to be holding up well, with the comfort maintained even after the &quot;heavy&quot; use of the seats for the first 50,000 miles.

The trunk is large enough for our use, and we are yet to fill it, the small pass through port between the trunk and the interior of the vehicle has been used a couple of times to transport longer items, and is functional and useful.

I have concerns that the quality that I am used to from the older Nissan models are no longer present, but I am hopeful that the vehicle will perform for at least my usual use of 150,000 fast miles, although I purchased the vehicle in hopes of getting 200,000 miles.  

I find that, even with my reservations, the vehicle is worth the money I paid, and based upon my past experience, I will receive good value for the money.<br><br>
