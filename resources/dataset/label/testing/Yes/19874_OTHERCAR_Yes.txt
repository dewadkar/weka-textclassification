            We purchased our HP C30 digital camera so we could easily publish pictures on our website for our out of town relatives to see.  Our experience with it has been wonderful.  It is very easy to use and takes good quality pictures.  It has 3 different settings which enable to store anywhere from 17 - 80 photos at a time depending on the setting you use.  We are able to use the lowest setting if we know we are going to put the picture on the website or we can use the higher setting to be able to print the pictures.  You are able to change the setting from picture to picture which is nice.  Once ready to upload the pictures to you computer you simply plug in the provided cables and follow the simple instructions on the software that comes with the camera.

The camera has a small viewing window, but it serves it's purpose.  You can view the photos as you take them and if they aren't want you want, you are able to delete them and retake as needed.  The zoom feature is a little difficult to use, but is operational if you have to use it.  I rarely use it.

Overall we have been very happy with our purchase.  It's definitely worth the money.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in trying a digital camera and working with a website.<br><br>
