            Okay I am here to talk trucks, and I do mean trucks.  I am not talking about the little Isuzu or Toyota tiny trucks that you see out there.  I am speaking of <b>HEAVY DUTY</b> Trucks! I got my Chevrolet 1500 HD Crew Cab 4WD LS Model.  From my research on the internet the average pricing I found was this: 

<b>MSRP: $33,950
INVOICE: $29,706
MARKET: $31,688</b>

This truck is in a class of its own.  You feel like you own the highway.  It almost seems as if you are going over the lane lines on both side since it is so wide.  It drives like a dream, or as my friend said, &#147it&#146s a Caddy on BIG wheels.&#148  Well regardless let's get to the basics and go from there.

The engine is a Vortec 6000 V8 SFI and has about 300 horsepower at 360 ft of torque.  It comes in a standard four speed automatic transmission because as far as I can see it would be a bit much to handle shifting and all.  There were two models, the LS and the LT.  I went for the LS because I was going to get an incredible deal on it. 
 
<b>The LS model comes with these features</b>:
AM/FM CD player single CD
Cruise Control
Leather wrapped steering wheel
Remote Keyless Entry
Power door locks, mirrors and windows
Self dimming mirror with a compass and outside temperature control

<b>From the base model it already was equipped with</b>:
dual front airbags
antilock 4-wheel disc brakes
daytime running lights  
air conditioning w/dual-zone manual climate control
power steering
tilt steering wheel
vinyl upholstery
split bench seat
folding rear bench seat
cupholders
rear-hinged rear doors 
digital clock
tachometer
engine-hour meter
trip computer
passenger-side visor mirror
cargo-box light
intermittent wipers
automatic headlights
rubber floor covering

So all these features were there but on the one I found I got those bucket seats that I love with a 6 way power switch instead of the 40/20/40.  It already had a trailering package on it which just included a trailer-hitch platform, 6-wire harness, high-capacity air cleaner, and transmission-oil cooler.  Instead of the single CD it was also already equipped with the Bose Audio System with 8 speakers, 6 disc in dash AM/FM stereo.  There are even controls for the stereo in the back seats, not sure that would be that great of an idea if I had a teenager.  However Chevy has a system that you can track your truck on the internet if you did have a teenager and wanted to see where they were going.  They also have a neat little device that works with your cell phone to alert you if your truck is being stolen.

Usually this would add up to about another two or three grand so the sticker on it was $37,245.00.  But we&#146ll get to pricing later&#133

Well like I said it drove like a dream.  When I am ready for my boat it can tow up to 7800 lbs.  There was also what I would call the push button 4WD but I think they have a more technical name for it.  I just remember back in the old days with my mom&#146s 4runner we had get out to lock and unlock the hubs.  Well that has been eliminated.  

The model I chose was pewter, but I know they have black, a metallic blue, red, dark green, and gray I think.  The outside of the vehicle is beautiful as far as trucks goes.  When you sit in the driver&#146s seat it is as if you are on top of the world!  It is so high and I being 5 ft just love that for once in my life I can tower over someone.  You also feel very safe with the ability to see over everything and also the sturdiness of the ride.  Surprisingly though, the ride is smooth.  My dad had a Toyota in the 90s that bumped me all over the place.  

I decided on stepping up to the Crew Cab level so it seats 5 comfortably.  You may be able to squeeze one more in.  The dash is set up for easy handling and touching within reach.  Overall I love my CHEVY!!

I went around to look for the best deal and here is my story:
I called around to about 15 dealerships.  I was not about to waste my time going from place to place to find my truck.  I found the truck and the did all of my negotiating over the phone.  The truck was listed at $37,245.00 as the sticker.  The specs included all that is standard on an LS Model but as I said earlier, added bucket seats, trailer package, 6 disc cd changer, wheel flaps, and a bed liner.  First of all I knew by doing all my research that this was the truck for me.  It is breathtaking beautiful.  

I started the bidding war and then they were firm on $31,500.  The manager didn't want to budge until I came down there.  Well I explained that I wouldn't come down until I saw that price under $30K.  Well I got it for $29K with all of the above.  The gas mileage is a bit rough with 7.5 in city and 15 on highway.  It is extremely comfortable.  I haven't had any real drawbacks to it yet.  I also went with the 3 year extended warranty.  I love Chevys but it always seems like when your warranty runs out the problems (little or big) start to happen.  

Anyways, I highly recommend getting this truck.  There is a reason that it is rated the #1 truck of the Year!  It can't even compare to Dodge, Toyota, or Ford and how can you beat that price???
