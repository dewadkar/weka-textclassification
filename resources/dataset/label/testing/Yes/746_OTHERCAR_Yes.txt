            We purchased our 94 Altima used about 4 year ago for $8900.  There was about 50,000 miles on it, and it is now just past the 150,000 mile marker.  This has been a great car for what we needed.

The EXTERIOR:  The exterior of the 1994 Altima is not the most sporty look you can find, but it certainly isn't the ugliest car on the road either.  The paint on our car is peeling, which can be expected at this age, but I do have a 1992 Geo Metro that doesn't have one problem with the paint.  The paint problem started probably 2 years ago, so not bad.

The INTERIOR:  The inside of the car is well layed out.  It has never seemed overly cramped in the front or back, but I would not recommend this car be used as a "family" car if your family has more than one child (mainly for the room you need for luggage, ect).  We are getting ready to purchase a mini-van for this very reason (baby number 2 is on the way).  There is a nice looking dash, and the controls are easy to reach, and it feels very comfortable to drive this car.  The A/C unit still blows as cold as a new car.

The DRIVE:  This might be an older car, but because of the comfort and smooth ride (as well as ample power for a car this size/price), it is still a fun car to drive.  We don't have problems passing or getting onto the interstate.  

The BOTTOM LINE:  If you are looking for a good cheap car, this one will fit the bill nicely, both figuratively, and literally:).  We have 150,000 miles on ours, and are not going to trade it when we buy the minivan because, frankly, we would feel comfortable taking this car across the country tomorrow.  It has never given us the first mechanical problem.  As a matter of fact, last week we drove it 7 and a half hours each way to Florida last week for a cruise we took.  And it didn't make the first odd noise, just delivered us in comfort to the ship:)
