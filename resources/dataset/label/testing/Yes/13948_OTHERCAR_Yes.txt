            I am a proud owner of a 1990 white Toyota Supra MKIII (made from 1986.5-1992).  This car is filled with options that make the ride smooth and enjoyable like cruise control, power steering, power windows, power locks, anti-theft alarm.  MKIII Supras come with a 3  Liter Inline 6 engine which produces 200 horsepower and a 187 lbs of Torque.  My Supra MKIII is equipped with a 6 speaker and 6 tweeter system which provides for good sound. I switched all the factory speakers and the factory stereo head so that the system would be better.  I have a over 200,000 miles on this car and it still runs fine.  I haven't had to spend a lot of money on repairs in the shop.  In comparison, my friend who has a 1990 Firebird has already spent thousands on keeping his car in shape.  Another competitor of the Supra MKIII, the 1990 Nissan which is a really nice looking car can cost a lot of money in expenses to keep in good condition.  Supras MKIII's are really easy to soop up too. As soon as I get enough money, I will add an HKS exhaust to my car which should increase the horsepower by 30 horsepower.  The record set by HKS Racing Team for an MKIII supra is at 800hp! As a used car, the Toyota Supra is a best buy for power, control, features, and reliability.     <br><br>
