            With our family of 4 plus two sets of grandparents, we really needed a bigger car to carry all 8 of us. Our trusted 1993 Toyota Previa was flawless; however, it only holds 7. When we go out, we had to drive two cars.

We narrowed our Previa replacement down to two: the Toyota Sequoia and the Suburban. (The Ford Excursion is just too BIG.) We are used to the reliability of the Toyota. The Sequoia is well made with the typical fit and finish of a Japanese car. We particularly like the fact that the Sequoia has head-rests and shoulder belts for the center seats in row 2 and 3. The only problem with the Sequoia is the luggage space in the back. The Sequoia definitely is not going to hold luggage for 8 people.

This takes us back to the Suburban. Our main need is to carry people. We have no intention of going off road or drive in the snow (we live in Southern California). We picked the 1500 2WD model.

Standard Equipment:
1. 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS
2. Remote and power door lock, power windows
3. Side mounted assist steps
4. Inside mirror with compass and outside temp displays
5. Daytime running lamps and fog lamps

The LT trim comes with the following:
1. AM/FM/Cassette/CD with 9 speakers/subwoofer
2. Rear seat audio controls
3. Leather seat for 1st and 2nd rows
4. 6 way power/heated bucket seats
5. Electronic climate control
6. On-star and Homelink (garage door remote)

Our car also came with Traction Assist package and the "Trailering" package.

We highly recommend the liftgate with the liftglass. The other option is the "barn doors", which will block off a large area in the rear view mirror.

The new On-star antenna is a short stubby antenna on the driver side roof top. In previous years, it is a cell phone like antenna on the driver side rear window. Other than that, there does not appear to be any body style changes from a 2001 model.

Here are some of the PROs:
1. We really like the rich leather seats. We did not expect it in a SUV of this class.
2. The roomy luggage space is one of the main reason we purchased this SUV.
3. The ride is smooth and relatively quiet, for a SUV, on the freeway here in Southern California.
4. The "standard" trailer hitch is nice. We have already purchased a bike rack for the Suburban and will be looking forward to do some bike riding trips with the kids.
5. Any finally, who can turn down 0% financing from GM?

Here are some CONs:
1. Since our main purpose for the Suburban is to carry people, we did not like the fact that the middle seats for the center, and back rows do not have head rests or shoulder belts. In addition, the center seat in the second row is rather hard. It actually flips down to become a tray.
2. Poor gas mileage... but it is still better than driving two cars.
3. The fit and finish is still not quite up to par. The center console storage area has a lot of wasted space. The area under the cup holder is totally empty. The plastic is better than previous years, but still look and fell kind of cheap.
4. We are hearing a little rattle noise already inside the Suburban with only 1000 miles.

Overall we are happy with our purchase so far. We have taken many trips already with all 8 of us in the Suburban. We are a little apprehensive about the reliability of the Subruban, since we were spoiled with the Previa for 8 years.
