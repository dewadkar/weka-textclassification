            I loved the look of the intrepid, I was tired of minivans and econocars so I bought a 1996 Dodge Intrepid 2 years ago.  The styling is sleek and sporty, with tons of backseat room where I put 4 children straight across when I have to.  I would have expected to pay alot more for what I've gotten.  The car now has 92,000 miles and it rides very smoothly, and I'm sure the 16 inch tires have alot to do with that.  They are more expensive than what I'm used to but the ride, traction and appearance make the extra expense worth it.  I've put only a couple hundred dollars of maintenance into the car so far.  The only problem I have is with the locking system.  Don't forget the keys in the car or it may sometimes lock you out.  This is a drivers car.  If you love to feel good cruising down the highway with radio on, you'll love this car.  It's fun to drive. Hey, even the gas mileage is great and who wouldn't love that?  I won't hesitate to update to the 2000 Intrepid but I haven't gotten sick of this one yet!<br><br>
