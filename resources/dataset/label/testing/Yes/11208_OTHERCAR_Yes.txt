            i own a 97 Nautica Villager.  I was bummed when i got a mini van but have actually loved every minute of it.

   This has been a great vehicle for my family.  Originally i wasn't to excited about getting a minivan but i wanted to carry more people than 4-5 people. 7 people fit in there pretty easily.  3 way in the back 2 in the middle and 2 in front.  

   This Mini-van is great.  It handles just like a car except that your elevated alittle so there is a great view of everything around you.  This one is even kind of sporty. There is a lot less sway to this van when it turns compared to the others we drove.

   This van has all the creature comforts. There is Climate control, a    6 cd changer with the premium sound. I was shocked, the sound is clear with enough volume that your ears will ring after a good song but still has a lot of depth at low volumes.  The radio and the cruise have remote controls that are perfectly placed on the steering wheel for easy operation with your thumbs.  Passengers are alittle cramped but the captains chairs back there help. There is also a separate control panel to control the temp in the back and control the radio and cd.  It has automatic headlights, keyless entry, power moon roof, powered rear wing windows. 

The only problem i have had with the van is the cd player has given me problems 2 separate times the past 3 years. The front windows start jerking alittle when you are lowering it. 

The seats are pretty comfy. i have been on several long road trips and have little trouble with comfort. the arm rests in the front help. they are a perfect height for me when i sit there.  The 8 way adjustable seat for the driver helps too.  i always look forward to taking those long road trips and actually plan them more now.
