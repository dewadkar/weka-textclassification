            When I purchased my 1280 nearly two years ago, it was going for around $800.00.  I purchased it on the basis of considerable research which indicated that it would easily produce high quality images in the hands of a fool, yet it has features which will allow a more accomplished photographer to ply his knowledge (just in case I advance from the fool level).  I was, and remain completely satisfied after nearly two years of use.  

On the positive side, it is simplicity itself to use with such idiot proof features as auto-focus and auto-flash.  Add to this a great deal of adaptability offered by such features as zoom, macro settings, manual focus, exposure adjustment, etc.  You pretty much have the same flexibility and control offered by any high end 35mm camera.  It is completely up to the task of any computer graphics use and if you have a high quality color printer, the high resolution images which can be obtained are quite startling.  The rotating lens is a wonderful features which allows you to take photos from any angle and still be able to see the viewer.  The controls are quite comfortably placed and operation of this camera is very intuitive, a great feature for those of us who hate manuals.  The lens is threaded so you can use standard photographic filters.  Not one problem with the camera after two years of fairly high usage is a good sign as well.

On the downside, there is considerable delay between pressing the &quot;shutter&quot; and the camera actually grabbing the image, which makes this camera practically useless for action shots where timing is important.  It also requires a fair amount of time to store the image and reinitialize for the next shot.  The battery charger which was supplied with the camera is (in my case at any rate) useless.  Battery consumption is rather high.  I can usually get about 15 minutes of continuous use with a new set of Energizers and about 10 minutes from rechargables. 

Now you can get the thing for under $300.00!  I feel like I got my money's worth at over $800.00.<br><br>
