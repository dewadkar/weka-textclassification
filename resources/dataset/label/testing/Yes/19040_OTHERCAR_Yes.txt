            I recently bought this camera as an upgrade to a the D-450Z, and I must say that it is well worth the extra money and towers over all other digital cameras that I have come across in this price range. It is incredibly small, yet so rich in functionality. Its great for the point and click user through more sophisticated photographers who want to monitor white balance, exposure, compensation, manual focus, etc. It has great macro features for close-up shots, has a remote control, and even has the fun option of making quicktime movies (no sound though...) My only fuss with this camera is with the lens cap, which is hard to keep track of since it doesn't come with a cord. Unlike other digicams in this price range, the 2020 comes with rechargeable batteries and the charger, along with an 8MB smartmedia card. GREAT CAMERA!!!Great pictures!!!<br><br>
