            The 1996 Honda Accord is yet another immortal automobile.  This car is dependable in all aspects.  I travel an average of 100 miles a day in stop and go traffic, and this car has no problem with it.  What makes those long drives even more comfortable and bareable is the roominess inside.  There is so much room in this car that you might as well add another seatbelt for another passenger.  It runs smoother than you can believe.  You feel like you are cruising at any speed.  If you are suffering from the rising gas prices, you will not be complaining with this car.  I get an average of 365 MPG in stop and go traffic.  With these kind of miles, you will never have to worry about continuously filling up.  I promise you, you will be saving alot of money from gas.  Everything about this car is great, but its too bad that I don't have one anymore.  I was involved in a near fatal car accident in this vehicle a few months ago.  Someone had ran a red light while I was making a left turn.  His speed was about 45MPH!  His car ran half way through my car from the passenger side, but never reaching me in the driver's seat.  This was unbelievable.  My car was smashed in its side, but relieved me with not a scratch on my body.  If you were to see my car after the accident, you would think that someone died, but rather, I was left untouched.  This car is not only great in basically EVERYTHING, it also SAVED MY LIFE!
