            I am not an easy person to please when it comes to electronics.  I almost always buy something, and then wish I had bought something else.  That is not the case with this camera.  I have yet to find anything wrong with it. In fact, it outperforms my expectations.  

First, the picture quality is outstanding.  It definitely is a few steps up from 35mm point and shoot cameras.  I am thoroughly impressed with this cameras ability to adjust to pretty much any light.  I have taken several pictures indoors in different types of light and this camera adjusts with ease.  

The video on this camera was also impressive considering it's not really made for that kind of work.  Many have said, if you are wanting a camera that shoots good video, then buy a camcorder, and I agree.  However, if you are wanting to shoot short "fun" videos, then this camera is great.  The video is choppy because of a small frame rate, but the detail of the video is awesome.  

The quality of this camera seems pretty good.  It has a little weight to it and doesn't feel like a cheap plastic toy like some of the other brand of cameras.  The camera also looks nice.  I know that is completely a matter of opinion, but I feel Panasonic did a great job designing this camera.

The LCD on this camera is really quite clear and quite handy.  

The menus were a little confusing at first and took some getting used to.  It didn't take long though and if you just get to know your camera, you won't have much trouble.

The downfall of this camera is it's battery life.  However, it's no worse than any other digital camera.  If you are in the market for ANY digital camera, then invest in an adapter or a rechargeable battery kit.  Panasonic sells the adapter for this camera for an astonishing 70 dollars, but i have seen "universal" adapters for much less.  

I had done a lot of research before buying this camera.  The main selling point to me was Panasonic's outstanding reputation for making products that last.  I wasn't sure of how this camera would perform because Panasonic isn't well-known for making cameras like companies such as Nikon, Minolta, and Canon; but I now have no doubt that this camera is ready to compete.  

If you are wanting to know if I would recommend this to my friends, then the answer is yes.  I purchased my camera and took it to my friend's house.  The next day, he went and got one exactly like it.  This camera is amazing and you won't be disappointed.
