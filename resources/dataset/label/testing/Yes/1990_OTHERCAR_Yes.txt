            I bought my Maxima used (off lease) about three years ago and I really have enjoyed it.  It drives very smoothly and the engine just purrs.  It does have a few minor quirks, but they are nothing serious.  I have driven on the highway  and on city streets and it performs well in either capacity.  The only problem  that I have had is with the oxygen sensor.  It caused my "check engine" light  to come on.  Shortly after this, I got a voluntary recall letter from Nissan and the problem was fixed immediately.  The only con I can find with the car is the gas mileage.  It gets decent mileage, but it uses premium gas.  With the high prices this past summer, I became very aware of the weakness in this area.  Overall though, I would definitely recommend this car.
