            I bought this '94 240SX Convertible last year ('99) after shopping around for a good used &quot;ragtop&quot; that I could use day-to-day , road trips , and fun . We (my wife and I) had searched around and looked at Chryslers and Mustangs but found these almost everywhere . Since I am a big guy (6'2&quot; and 235 lbs.) the field was limited . This has been an excellent buy and attracts attention wherever we go since it is kind of rare . I fit comfortably as well as my (5'4&quot;) wife . It is fun and sporty and we have had no problems at all . Our (3)dogs also consider it a real treat to ride in it and actually beg to go . <br><br>
