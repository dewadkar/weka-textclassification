            The Sony Digital Mavica MVC-FD81 ($800 street) is an innovative merging of PC photography and consumer A/V technology. This latest version of the Mavica lets you capture high-resolution 1,024-by-768 still images, as well as 640-by-480 images and MPEG-1 video -- all saved on standard floppy disks. Using JPEG compression, you can fit up to 16 high-resolution or 40 low-resolution images on a single disk. In video-capture mode, a single disk can hold 15 seconds of 320-by-240-resolution video or 60 seconds of 160-by-112-mode video, including audio. The MVC-FD81 includes four special-effects modes, six lighting modes, a bright 2.5-inch color LCD, 3X optical zooming, and built-in audio recording. But the MVC-FD81's core capabilities, excellent image captures, and easy file transfers are what make it a real winner.
