            I agree with others who have said that the Olympus D-450 Zoom is not a professional camera, it really isn't.  However, if you are like me, and have been using a high end point and shoot 35mm film camera for the last 10 years, this may just be the camera to leap you into digital photography.

The problem I've had with earlier model digital cameras has always been the quality of the images, not necessarily the size of them.  Although ultimately my goal in buying a digital camera has been to replace my film camera -- and that includes making prints of my best shots -- I knew for a fact that most of my images would be at 640x480 on a web page somewhere, not in print.  However, being able to take 1280x960 uncompressed TIFF images is a big plus for getting high quality images of my significant other's artwork (she's a visual artist) into a digital form for her to do further manipulation.

Overall, in 3 months of using the D-450 Zoom, I figure I've taken well over 2000 images.  It took me awhile playing with the various image controls to figure out just how to take really good pictures in all situations.  It isn't just as simple as point and shoot, setting the white balance and flash mode is very important.  With a bit of practice now, I've been especially pleased with the low-light images I've been taking.

One thing I found quickly was that downloading images from the camera via the serial port was just too slow.  I really do wonder why Olympus chose to put a serial port on the D-450 Zoom instead of going to USB.  The cost of going with USB shouldn't have been much more, and certainly the camera is new enough that USB was already proven in the marketplace.  I went ahead and got the Olympus USB SmartMedia reader, and have been much happier about transferring images ever since.  (My significant other is also happy that she can transfer images straight onto her iMac instead of having to go through my PC first.)

My only other gripe about the D-450 Zoom is that Olympus could do a better job simplifying their user interface.  Their icons are often confusing, and I admit that I accidentally erased my entire first batch of pictures by not having the manual handy to double-check the meaning of the icons.  (I know what the &quot;erase all&quot; icon looks like now though, believe me.)  The whole point of icons is to make the interface easier to understand, Olympus seems to have lost site of that fact with their digital cameras.

So I guess what it comes down to is this, the Olympus D-450 Zoom gives you excellent image quality and resolution for the money.  If you just want a pure point-and-shoot snapshot camera, you could probably save some money and go with a less expensive model, but if you want a camera that gives you a slightly greater degree of control and are willing to tweak the settings for your shooting conditions, the D-450 Zoom can't be beat.
Now if only the dye sublimation printers would come down in price, my replacement of my film camera would be complete.
