            The Honda CR-V is a good addition to the overcrowded SUV crowd.  It's not quite as intimidating as a Ford Expidition or the Lincoln Navigator.  It's also got all the handling and fuel efficiency of a sedan.  Let's take a look at some of its advantages and disadvantages.

A D V A N T A G E S

Fuel Efficient
If you've owned a small car for a long time,  then you're probably acustomed to only filling up every so often.  With the CR-V, you won't even notice a change.  You'll fill up about as often, but still reap the benefits that come from having a larger vehicle.

Manual Transmission
I admit it - I love driving stick shifts.  They're so much more safe in the snow (you don't always need to use your breaks) and they're so much more fun to drive.  It's becoming more difficult, but you can even find a CR-V with a manual transmission in it.  

Handling
Surprisingly enough, this handles much like a small car does.  The CR-V isn't much larger than a Accord or Camry, but does have a significantly larger cabin.  But, this Honda can handle the road just as well as any small car.  The first time I drove it, I didn't have to readjust how I guaged my left turns.  I never felt it about to roll over on freeway turns.  It was just as easy to use my mirrors as with my Ford Taurus.  Life in a snowy area?  No problem.  This thing handles the road better than any small car can.  It has a four-wheel-drive option to handle the Detroit ice and snow.  If you have a manual, you'll have even more control.  

Affordable
This is only a $20K truck.  Considering what you're getting this isn't a bad deal.  You also won't be bogged down with the same insurance payments that other trucks have (like the Dodge Durango).  If you have kids who are of driving age, you might want to think about getting this one instead - just for the insurance that you'd save.

This is a truck?
Now, let's face the facts.  Nobody buys an SUV for practical reasons.  We don't buy them because they're safe - because they're not as safe as a car or van.  We don't buy them because they're fuel efficient - because they're not.  We don't buy them because they have enough room for the kids - they don't; not more than a minivan or station wagon.  So why do we get them?  Because they look cool, that's why.  And that's okay.  

The CR-V is a good compromise because you get the good handling features of a truck mixed in with the good safety and fuel efficiency of a smaller car.  But this is definitely not an 'aggressive' SUV.  If you're looking for something that will make you look cool in front of the ladies/fellas when you drive, this might not be what you're looking for.  If you're looking for an SUV with all of the above features, than take a closer look.  

More power?
Now, granted, the CR-V has more power than most sedans.  But it can't beat other SUV's in a muscle test.  It only has a V6 engine compared with the V8 of a Ford Expedition.  If you're looking for towing capacity for your boat or car, you might need something a little more muscular.  

                                * * * 

So if you need an SUV with the advantages of both (SUV and small-car) worlds, than give the CR-V a try.  If you're looking for the hot new aggressive SUV, than keep on looking.  <br><br>
