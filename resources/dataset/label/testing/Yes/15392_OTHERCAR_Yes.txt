            This is the greatest digital camera.  Talk about convenience, ease and great pictures, this camera has it all.

This camera was bought for us as a gift when my daughter was born.  It has been nothing but a joy.  It uses floppy discs as the film so as long as you have a disc you have film.  The battery is a litium rechargeable battery so you are not spending tons of money on batteries.

The quality of the camera is great.  It has a zoom lens which is great for our purposes.  I love it for my sons basketball games and soccer games.  You dont have to be close up to get great pictures.  

We have been using the camera to send pictures all over the world.  My dad even printed some up on quality photo and the pics are almost as good as a studio picture.

The cost of the camera is $599.00. (worth every penny)

I recommend that you also buy the starter pack.  The starter pac comes with the carrying case, a cleaning cloth and an extra battery.  The price for the starter pack is $79.99.  The battery alone is worth it.<br><br>
