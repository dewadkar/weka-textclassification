            My parents purchased their first Isuzu pickup about 8 years ago--it now belongs to my brother, and has over 100,000 miles on it and still humming along, so when they needed another truck for errands, hauling wood, etc., the looked back to Isuzu and came up with the Hombre.  They purchased the 2WD, extended cab version (jump seats behind the main seats).  This has proven to be every bit as dependable as the previous one that they owned, getting great gas mileage (usually over 25mpg) no matter what kind of gas they put in it.  Driving it has the feel of a car, and riding it in you forget that you are in a truck.  While it doesn't have the feel of a fine auto, it doesn't feel like a truck, either.  It's suspension smooths out the road bumps and the cab (at least on this version) has enough sound proofing to blank out most of the noise from outside.  

The seats are bucket, and comfortable, and the instruments are all in easy reach/veiw of the driver.  While it doesn't have a full size bed, we have carried 4x8 sheets of plywood without problem, as well as garden mulch, trees, and other assorted items one finds to fill a truck bed with!  We often use the truck to attend craft shows, and use it to haul our display booth in the bed, it is amazing the amount of items we can fit into the bed on this truck!  We often haul all our 6' long display tables (6), our display framework, our dolly, chairs, cash register stand, display racks, lattice boards, and several plastic containers of product all in the bed.

One negative would be the turning radius, this truck takes a lot of room to turn--more so than you would ever imagine for a truck this small.  Often you have to drive foreward and back to possition yourself into parking places if you haven't made a wide enough approach to the spot. Otherwise, the motor gives good power, lots of zip, and good gas economy.

The jump seats are good child seats, but wouldn't recommend them for adult seating unless you are a contortionist.   Just too small a seat and too hard to get into and out of.

However, if you are looking for a good, dependable, economical truck, this one can't be beat, and for the price, you get alot of vehicle!
