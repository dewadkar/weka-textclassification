            Well the 222 horsepower Maxima raises another question.  How much hp can you shove in to an ugly exterior.  Quite a few as it turns out.  Anyway,  I personally dont like the exterior body design.  It is practically the same as the years before with the exception of the slightly modified rear lights.  The interior is quite nice with the full leather interior option.  But what car isn't nice with full interior.  Forgive me for not liking this car.  By all means its a good car as far as speed and luxury combined.  But still not good enough to live up to its 26k loaded sticker price tag.  However they managed to put 22 more horsepower in to that small v6 engine and still get 25mpg which I am quite impressed with seeing as how gas prices seem to keep going up.  Anyway my overall verdict is Solid car.  Very nice interior.  Good enough speed.  But ugly body design and lack of thought for the body design.<br><br>
