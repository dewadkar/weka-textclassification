            I purchased my Nikon Coolpix 950 at the end of June, 2000 to replace my Olympus D-400Z digital camera. I was very pleased with the Olympus, but as I learned more about photography I began to desire a level of manual control that the D400Z did not offer. I am writing this opinion on August 2, 2000 and in the 5 weeks that I have had my Nikon, I have taken 1,025 pictures with it. That is how much I like this camera.

First, the picture quality. In a word, it is outstanding. I have never seen a 2 megapixel camera that creates pictures as good as the 950. The pictures are so good, I picked the 950 over the 3 megapixel 990 because there just isn't enough difference in picture quality to justify the extra cost of the 990. With my Olympus, every picture I took went through Photoshop and got sharpened and saturation increased because the colors were a little too muted for my taste. With the 950, none of this is necessary. The colors are dead on accurate and the sharpness is perfect. The only thing I do in Photoshop now is to resize the 1600x1200 files to 1024x768. 

The second major strength of the 950 is the macro mode. No other digital camera on the market can match the macro abilities of the 950/990. It will get in closer (as close as 2 cm) and focus sharper than any other camera. It is truly amazing. If you are interested in seeing some of my macro shots, go to http://www.fototime.com/inv/3E85A4EE119AD66 for samples.

The level of manual control on the 950 is excellent as well. You can put the camera in full auto mode so that it is a point and shoot that makes all the decisions for you. Or you can select shutter priority or aperture priority and the camera automatically calculates the other for you (in other words, if you are in shutter priority and set the shutter for 1/250 second, the f/stop will be calculated automatically or you can set the f/stop for 3.5 and the shutter speed is calculated automatically.) It also has adjustable ISO, matrix/spot/center weighted metering, white balance presets, manual white balance (aim at something white and set the WB based on it,) continuous shooting mode, etc. and so on. I can go on but you can read reviews of the camera for full details. Suffice it to say, the camera is not lacking anything in the user control department.

As with everything in life, the 950 comes with a few sacrifices. There are some quirks that the 950 has that are downright annoying and some things that make you wonder what the designers of the camera were thinking. The most annoying thing to me is the horrible problem with red-eye in pictures of people. The flash on the 950 is placed very close to the lens and therefore the red eye problem is severe. There is a redeye reduction lamp on the 950 that is a total joke and makes no difference whatsoever. This problem can be fixed with an external flash (since the 950 has an external flash connector,) but that will cost you another $100 at least for the flash and bracket, plus it significantly increases the size of your rig. Another annoyance is that the compact flash slot is placed so that with the camera mounted on a tripod, the memory card is inaccessible. If you need to get your card out, you have to take it off the tripod. Same for the battery door. Third, the lens cap is not attached to the camera in any way and therefore is prone to being lost. The 990 comes with a string that attaches between the two swiveling halves of the camera. Why nothing on the 950? Another annoyance is that the LCD screen is totally useless in bright sunlight. Want to take a macro picture of a flower? You have to use the LCD for proper framing but if it is sunny outside you can't see it. So you end up using one hand to try and shield the LCD while shooting with the other and it is a pain. And while I mention macro shots, you can't use the self timer in macro mode. This is a problem because with macro photography, the picture is much more prone to being blurry because of camera shake since the subject is so close to the lens. One way to get around this is to put the camera on a tripod, fram your shot, and set the self timer. That way, you don't have to touch the camera when it takes the shot. On the 950 this is not possible. Lastly, the LCD screen sucks the charge out of my NiMH rechargeable batteries like there is no tomorrow, but most digital cameras are this way so I really can't complain too much about that. Besides, I prefer the optical viewfinder myself.

After reading the above paragraph, you may be asking yourself why in the world I like this camera so much if it has so many negatives? Quite simply, the picture quality and level of manual control far outweigh the negatives that I have mentioned. Most of them are convenience issues that are just annoying. Note that the 990 has corrected many of these issues (because Nikon listens to its customers) but the bad redeye problem is still there. I would wholeheartedly recommend the Nikon 950 to anyone who is concerned primarily with picture quality and user control and isn't afraid to get their hands dirty and play with the camera settings to get the best possible output.<br><br>
