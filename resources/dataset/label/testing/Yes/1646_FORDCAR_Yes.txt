            I've been following the news about the Excursion since it was announced as a concept vehicle and I scoured the web for pictures of early prototypes, and news of its arrival.  I am glad to say I was not disappointed when I got my first glimpse of one in person.  After waiting patiently for what seemed like forever, the first time I saw the Excursion on the lot of my local Ford dealer, I nearly drove off the road.  It was as impressive as I had imagined.  The stylish hood stolen from the truck frame that it's built on (F350 series) gives it a much cooler look than the plain old Chevy Suburban look.

In addition, Once I looked inside, I was very impressed with the creature comforts.  I am a big man, 6'6 and 350 lbs, and I have a hard time fitting in a lot of vehicles, but not the Excursion.  As well, in most vehicles the passenger in the seat behind me is pretty much cramped.  This also was not true in the Excursion.  The third seat was much more roomy than the third seat of a Suburban, and the storage area is slightly larger behind the third seat.  Another nice feature is entry access to the third seat is available from either side of the vehicle, not just the passenger side as with the Suburban.

I have a good friend who has leased Suburban's for a few years, and I like them, but the styling and the extra room of the Excursion really make it a better choice in my opinion for those wanting the most passenger/storage room in a large SUV.  As far as towing capacity is concerned, I am not very aware of the either the Excursion or Suburbans' capacity, and would not be qualified to make a statement on the towing capacity since I would not anticipate towing anything myself.

There are drawbacks, including Ford's history of getting the bugs out of their vehicles after the first release.  The other obvious down side is the gas mileage.  Expect 10 mpg at best.  However, most people spending the type of money that these things run (base price around 33K, nicely equipped around 41K, and fully loaded close to 50K) aren't all that concerned about mpg.

For what it's billed to be, the Excursion delivers.  It has a smooth ride, tons of room, plenty of creature comforts, and is poised to take the top dog spot away in the Large SUV market away from Chevy.  

I would recommend it to large families that can afford the payments and the gas.  This is not a vehicle for people who do not like to drive anything that is large, for obvious reasons.  However, you might want to wait a year until Ford refines it and comes out with the 2001 model, based on their history of having their premier models be a bit buggy.  By then, the hype may die down as well, and the prices may fall due to additional competition in this market from other truck manufacturers.<br><br>
