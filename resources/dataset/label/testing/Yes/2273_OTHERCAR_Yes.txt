            My husband recently traded in his Ford F150, and due to moving to the mounains of Colorado, needed something with 4wd. We drove alot of trucks, before opting for something &quot;fun&quot;. well, although the Amigo is fun to drive, the ride can be quite turbulent depending on the road or area you are in..it is small, but fits 4 comfortably for a short period of time. 

My greatest complaint is the dealership where we bought this car. Be prepared for a hassle! Isuzu is not known for their customer service skills i take it, and I was prepared to return the vehicle, just to prove my point.

postitive points about this vehicle are that it is affordable for being a 4wd, and handles nicely on turns, although dont turn to tightly to quickly or you might flip. its a quiet ride, (we got hard top) and the interior is set up nicely. It is a beefy little SUV that handles the road quite nicley.

on the down side, its bouncy. roomy, but not spacious. and i think there should be more clearance than there is. over all, id recommend it to a single guy who wants a fun car, not a family or someone who will be on the road alot..<br><br>
