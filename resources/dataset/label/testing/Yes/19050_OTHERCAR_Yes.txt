            This was actually the second digital camera I bought, replacing my Olympus D400 back in November 99. Personally, I've always been fond of Olympus cameras. In the digital market (until recently), it's been my opinion that the only other company marketing cameras that produced comparable image quality was Nikon with their CoolPix series (the new Canon's are also quite good, though). Here's a quick rundown of what I think are the Pros and Cons. 

<b>Pros:</b> 
<i>Image quality</i> - as I said, I've always been impressed with the Olys. Although this is only a 2 megapixel camera, the photos are still excellent for almost any use. I've printed a few 8x10s with it, and they looked fabulous. 3mp cameras are nice, but the increased image quality isn't always noticeable. 

<i>Usability</i> - it's generally well designed. Lots of somewhat-cryptic icons (although every camera has these), but if you play with the buttons or look through the manual, you can figure it out quite easily. The camera is a little bit small, though, so if you have big hands/fingers, that might be a concern. 

<i>Zoom</i> - has a 3x optical zoom, which is very useful. Although I wish more cameras would start including 5x or even 10x stabilized zooms like the Oly 2100UZ. 

<i>Program Mode</i> - more advanced photographers will appreciate things like the ability to control shutter speed, aperture size, etc. One of the things that I really like, though, is that even in the automatic (point and shoot) mode, you can still manually adjust the focus and exposure compensations. 

<i>Price</i> - with the 3 megapixel cameras out for a while (and the 4mp cameras coming soon), the 2020 has dropped in price considerably and represents and excellent bargain. 

<b>Now some cons:</b> 
<i>Lens cap</i> - unless you're really careful or tether it, you're likely to lose the lens cap. Same goes for the cap covering the flash socket. 

<i>Lousy accessories</i> - the camera comes with only an 8mb Smartmedia card and requires you to download images with an unbearably slow serial connections (get a USB reader!). The included software is worthless. They did, however, include a set of rechargeable nickel-metal hydride batteries and a charger, which are definite necessity and saves you $20. 

<i>Gimmicky</i> - depending on the user, this could go in the pro section, but I have yet to really use any of the extra features the camera has. They include things like: black and white or sepia toned shots, the movie mode, remote control, NTSC (TV) hookup, etc. Nice things for a feature list, but not really useful. I'd rather have them put a USB jack or larger internal buffer in the camera. 

And that's just about all I have to say about that...feel free to email me (nkeezer@ucla.edu) if you have any questions.
