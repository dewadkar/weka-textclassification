            I don't own one yet, but I will very soon. This is going to be my first new car.

From reading the reviews, this looks to be the most complete car in every possible way. What more can you ask for?  It will seat 4 adults with no difficulty, the car goes like a scalded dog, it has decent storage, decent fuel economy, looks pretty good, has all wheel drive, etc.

The question really is what DOESN'T it have???  When I shop for a car I want something sporty. A typical car these days is nothing close to sporty. And anything that does happen to be sporty is usually $50,000 or more in price and if it isn't, it's a Firebird, Camero, or Mustang and we all know how lousy they are.  This car really moves. The supercharger gets the most out of the engine. A textbook example of how you can get major league performance out of a small engine when you know what you're doing. (Clearly, no automaker in North America does.) This kind of engineering could only come from the brilliant minds across the seas. (Where all of the world's finest vehicles are made.) 

Then there's the all-wheel drive:  FINALLY!  I vowed long time ago that I would never buy a car that was front wheel drive because of the poor handling and lack of control you get. And because they just aren't fun to drive compared to rear wheel drive cars. Now we have a car that uses all four wheels. What a concept!  And if you don't think that's good, check out the world rally championship wins. 

I love the price of this car, I love the racy interior, the look is decent (could be even racier) but overall this is the most significant car to hit North America in a long time. Watch for it, because it's going to sell like hot cakes.

The WRX gives people what they really want.
