            I inherited my New Yorker when my grandfather passed away about 5 years ago. It had been well cared for and it showed. The interior was in mint condition. The body was in mint condition. The mechanical parts had been well cared for as well.

The car had some 87,000 miles on it when I received it. It was a very dependable vehicle. I did in the few years I had it have to replace the original starter at about 150,000 miles. Let me see the original radiator had to be replaced at about 170,000miles. We had to replace the water pump at some 180,000 miles. This was not an easy task, but was do able. The car had about 193,000 miles on it when it had to retire not due to it failure though.

The parts for the vehicle were not always available at parts stores. Dealer only parts are a little more but when I was replacing ones that had lasted 100,000 plus miles it is worth it, I think. 

The car handled outstanding. The front wheel drive makes life so easy. I feel a lot safer driving in the mud and snow in a front wheel drive. It was so comfortable. You could just melt into the seats and go. I never hurt getting out of it after a long drive. 

To do basic maintenance such as oil change and air filter are very easy and accessible. Gas mileage ran anywhere from 18 to 27 MPG. So for the size and luxury it was reasonable.

I did love the luxuries of an outside thermometer and gas mileage and reminders. The sound system was totally awesome for a stock radio and speakers!

The only thing I disliked about it was, as a family; we out grew it very quickly. 

I think anyone that has a family would enjoy this car.
