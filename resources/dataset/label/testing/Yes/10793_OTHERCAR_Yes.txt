            As your typical soccer mom, when looking for a new vehicle, I was looking at minivans.  My husband kept trying to talk me into a Suburban but I felt that it was too big and would feel like I was driving a school bus.  I have to admit I did have some white knuckle moments when first driving our Suburban, but after a few days I quickly got used to driving it.  The first long trip we took in it was to the beach.  I not only had my family, but took my parents as well.  There was comfortably enough room for all and all of our luggage and supplies.  The vehicle we bought had the leather seats and the comfort and security options.  We were not actually looking for these options, however the vehicle we liked had them and we didn't want to wait to order a Suburban without them.  I am thrilled that we got them now.  The heated seats are fantastic for the winter, and I have found that the leather seats are much easier to keep clean up the messes made by the kids and the dogs.  The four wheel drive has come in very handy during the snowy winter months, and I have found that when my friends who own minivans are unable to go out in the snow I appreciate this purchase even more.  The only drawbacks I have found with this vehicle are the gas consumption ($60.00 to fill up and we only don't get the mileage to the gallon that we got with our Ford Taurus) and parking at the mall is now not as easy (I usually have to park further away -- which is actually a good thing as it forces me to exercise more ).  All in all I would recommend anyone looking for a larger family vehicle to seriously consider the Suburban.<br><br>
