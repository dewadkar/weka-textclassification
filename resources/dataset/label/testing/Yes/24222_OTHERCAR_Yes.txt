            I loved my Dakota.  The first truck I ever owned, it was great just as a tuck.  But when I got to test the safety of it, it went well beyond what I expected!

  I hit a deer with my Dakota, a small doe, right in the middle of the grill in the front.  When the police man came to write his report for insurance purposes, he couldn't believe that it was running, and I had driven it the 10 miles after the accident.  It should have been leaking from the radiator.  It was crunched, but I'm convinced if it had been any other small truck or car, it would have been much worse!! 

 My husband also had an incident in this truck, in that we hydroplaned and ran into a rock bluff.  The truck ended up being totaled, bent the frame and everything, but we(my husband, my two year old son, and myself)  all came out of the accident without a scratch.

  I swear by this truck, and won't hesitate to tell anyone who wants to hear what I think of it.  I think it is the safest truck I've ever heard about.  We now own a 96 Ram, and so far so good!!  This Dakota had all the basics, drove great, had lots of room for the size.  It sat at a good height, and was very comfortable to drive, or ride in.  We had lots of miles on it, and no major repairs had been needed up to that point.  It was a great little truck!!<br><br>
