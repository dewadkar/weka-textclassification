            This is a good camera.  I bought it over a month ago at Comp USA for about $600 total, including the case, an extra picture card, a battery charger and a set of rechargable batteries.

First, I'll tell you the weaknesses of the camera.  

In order to take great pictures with this camera you need to be good at photography.  You can't just point and click if you want super high quality pictures.  No amount of money you spend can buy you that I think.

Digital cameras in general are all a bit heavy.  If you plan on taking pictures all day with this camera, your hands will get tired.

It doesn't have a phenomenal zoom.  It is 2x optical and 3x digital.  I could have spent more and gotten a better zoom but I didn't.  If you are looking to take a lot of pictures at objects really close up or really far away, don't buy this camera.  Spend the extra couple hundred bucks.  It will be worth it for you.

It takes several minutes to upload all of the pictures that an 8mb or 16mb card can hold.  It's kind of a pain to sit and wait for it.  I've had it crash once during uploading, but I think that was my computer's fault not the cameras.  The camera went into what appeared to be a loop and the only way to stop it was to remove the batteries.  No damage done though.

Now the strengths.

The camera is remarkably easy to use if you don't feel like you need to take pictures like a pro.  I'm happy to just point and click and get fairly decent snap shots.  For the novice user this camera is fine.  It takes as good of pictures as my old $50 35mm did.

The memory cards can hold a ton of pictures.  On the lowest resolution setting (good enough for most of my pictures, though I must remember to flip over to the higher settings more often), my 16mb card holds well over 150 pictures.  Do you know how much it would cost me to get that much 35mm film developed?

If you take a lot of pictures, you will save money on developing with this camera.

It is really easy to get your pictures up on the web with a digital camera.

It is a name brand.  You can get extra memory cards and batteries (Kodak alkaline AA) almost everywhere.

It works well with my USB connection.

The Adobe software that comes with it is great.

It will be a real asset when I go to Mardi Gras.
