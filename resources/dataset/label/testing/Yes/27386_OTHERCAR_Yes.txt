            I have a Grand Caravan Sport with a 3.3 4 speed. Most of the vehicle is well designed and well optioned.

The rear split seat is nice for storage flexibility but not very comfortable for the person sitting on the split. The rollers on the seats make them easy to take in and out.

The powerslider is very sensitive and sometimes needs to be closed manually because something causes it to reverse on it's way closed.

The power hatch is a great option but can only be operated from the front or the remote.  It would be nice to have a "close button" on the rear post.

My biggest concern with this van is the powertrain.  Maybe it's my driving or the terrain - My last van was a 98 Grand Caravan sport with a 3.8 - But this one just can't measure up.  It's gear ratio or torch coverter or something is off just enough to make it feel sluggish--I use that term cautiously though. It's hard to explain, I feel that is't either a stop or go feeling. It likes to jump into the passing gear at the slightist hint of the need for more power. ie: going up a grade or hill, or taking off at an intersection.

My best mileage has been 19mpg with a/c on and 4 adults with weekend luggage(-nothing in tow-nothing on top). The OME sticker claims an average of 23mpg but the dealership says I'm average. I think I got closer to 26mpg with my 98.
I do alot of traveling. I've had the van for 5 months and have put on 14,000 miles. The 20 gal. tank just doesn't seem to last very long on a trip. (about 380 miles--with  good mileage)

Otherwise there is alot of good to this vehicle. Many nice little novalties in storage and power accessories. 
The Dual and rear air is great with the family.
