            I recently bought the new 2001 Grand Caravan SE, and absolutely love it.  Previously, I drove a 4 door Acura, and although I loved the car, there just wasn't enough room with the kids and all the miscellaneous stuff you need to take with them.

This new version was redesigned with a sleeker, more updated body.  The larger headlights make for better night driving.  

The ES version comes standard with the electric rear door that opens and closes at the touch of a button. This is great when you come out of a store with your hands full of packages.  The ES model I purchased has an automatic passenger sliding door for easy entry.  Other models have both doors automatic.  All automatic doors have safety features if someone (or something) gets in their way while they are closing.

Driving the Caravan, I immediately noticed the large front window and newly designed slanted hood, which allow for ample viewing area.  Let's you see the open road with no distractions.  The controls are positioned better than previous models, making them easier to reach while driving.  

The seats are extremely comfortable, both front and rear.  Although the front passenger seat seems to be higher than the driver seat (probably because of the storage compartment under it).  At work, I took out 7 adults, who all fit very comfortably even in the rear seats. The rear seat is now split for easier removal.  They are still a little heavy, but very easy to take out and put back in.

There is plenty of room in the rear for cargo, even when you have the rear seat in use.  I love the shopping bag hangers on the back of the rear seat.  This really helps groceries from shifting while in transit.

The car drives great, and seems to get the stated gas mileage.  It's a smooth, quite drive, and surprisingly, the car has great pickup.  

It's the first Minivan I've owned, and I was leery about the size and being able to park it easily.  That fear was gone after the first day.  Parking was a breeze !  

I can't say enough good things about this minivan, as I really do love it. I just wish I got the model with both rear side doors automatic. I'd recommend it to everyone!
