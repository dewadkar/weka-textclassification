            I had been looking for an SUV for a long time, but was scared of huge payments. I went to one of those big tent sales where they have multiple dealers available. I tried several different SUVs and none had enough headroom for me to be comfortable. I'm 6'3&quot; so it's hard find a vehicle that I can be comfortable in. Then I tried the Kia Sportage. Although it's not huge, it's really roomy believe it or not. This is the only SUV I could fit in without putting the seat at such an angle that I was almost in the back seat. Of course I didn't try one of the big boys mainly because of the huge price tag. 
When I went to the dealer the next day I saw a 2000 Sportage EX with a sunroof. I took the whole family for a test drive and it ran like a champ. It has good pop for a 4 cylinder. I love how it handles. I used to have a big Van and there is no comparison. I made a U turn the other day in a tight spot with no problem. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I got the extended warranty bumper to bumper(100K miles 10 years) which is great for the peace of mind.
So far the only thing I don't like is using the key to opening the trunk. I wish there was an open trunk button on the key chain. But I can live with it! I'm looking forward to driving the Kia for years to come!<br><br>
