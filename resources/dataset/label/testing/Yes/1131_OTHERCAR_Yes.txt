              Where should one start in describing this incredibly remarkable vehicle? The appearance of the vehicle was what sold me at first. The older models are cute but the 2000 Dodge Neon has both an adorable yet sophisticated appearance. I�ve experienced no problems so far in the four months that I�ve owned this car. It rides extremely smoothly and it has great alignment. The front seat is incredibly roomy. The passenger side has enough room for a tall person to fully extend their legs. The console of the car has a nice place to store tapes/c.d.�s and includes three large cup holders. The back seat has a nice comfortable touch. The way the back seat lets down into the trunk comes in handy when large things need to be stored. The trunk is roomy with extra space. The brakes are highly sensitive and provide a sense of security. I spend about 14 dollars on average to fill the car up. It�s got good gas mileage and with the dual side air bags, I wouldn�t feel safer in any other car.<br><br>
