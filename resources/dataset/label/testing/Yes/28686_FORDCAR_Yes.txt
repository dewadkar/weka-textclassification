            The Ford Econoline E250 is a good cargo/utility vehicle.  There are many things that you can do this vehicle, like you can lift it up for a very minimal price. Another thing that you can do is you can put a very nice stereo system into it because of the substancial amount of room that it provides.  The E250's seating arrangment is very roomy, there is two captians chairs in the front, then there is two more bencehes behind that with an optional forth row. Also, the E250 is very affordable, stating at around twenty thousand dollars.  The cons on this vehicle is that it is very long and had to park and it is very bad on gas.<br><br>
