            A step up from my last car (a 95 Mercury Sable) driving my new 2000 Maxima is great.  Even after having it for several months the car is just fun to drive.  It has an incredible sound system (Bose with 6 speakers and a sub woofer for that added base) with a CD player (the first time I've had one in my car).  If you haven't tried it yet you have no idea how fun it is driving around with the windows down and listening to music obnoxiously loud.  The power of the car is just great.  Having 222 horsepower is great for pulling out in front of some slow poke on the highway or just letting loose down a less frequented back road (might I add that the traction control is great).  So far the car hasn't given me any problems (but then again it is rather new) and from what I've heard Nisans are rather long lasting reliable cars.  
The only regret I have is getting a black exterior.  Even the tiniest scratch shows up bright as day on black paint which means $$$ in the future on body work.  
So I still recommend the Maxima 2000 I would just suggest getting some color other than black.<br><br>
