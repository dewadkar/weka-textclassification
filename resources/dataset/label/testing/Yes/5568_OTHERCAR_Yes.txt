                 Recently I was rear-ended and my car was totaled.  This left me feeling very frustrated especially when I tried to find another car for the amount the insurance company wanted to give me for my old car.  I looked and looked and thought I would have to settle for something several years older and not as nice.  One day I was driving through town and saw a car (a Lincoln Continental) that caught my eye, with a for sale sign in the window.  I pulled in to look at it and immediately fell in love with it but thought it was too new and too nice for my budget.  I took the number anyway and on a whim decided to call about it.  To my surprise, the people had bought a new car and needed to get it sold soon to pay for there newer one, so they had it priced more than reasonably and right in my budget.  After talking to the wife, I found out that her husband had purchased their new car without consulting her, and that she really liked this car better, but they couldn't keep both.  We test drove the car and almost immediately decided to buy it.  It was everything we wanted.  The ride is smooth and the car handles like a dream.  features on the console are awesome. A couple of things that were really important to us, were the leg room and seat manageability.  I have a short waist and often have a hard time seeing over the steering wheel, but with this car, I can adjust the seat up so that I can see just beautifully.  On the other hand, my husband and son are bigger and need the seat down and back.  The two profile buttons are perfect for us.  When we get in, I just push the #1 and the seats go to my settings.  When my husband or son get in, they push the #2 button and the seats go down and back for them.  Both the front and back have plenty of leg room for comfort.  Even my 6'3" son with the size 16 shoe sits very comfortably in the back seat. The leather seats are comfortable and support our backs beautifully.  Another thing we like is that it manages so easily.  We have test driven the bigger town car types and though they had all the bells and whistles, they were so big that they were sometimes harder to manage.  This car is just right, and seems to just glide where ever we are going.  Even when we drove down a bumpy dirt lane, my husband commented on how smooth the ride was. The engine runs smoothly and cleanly, and so far, we can't find a thing we don't like about it. So, my big question was, "Are you sure this is a '95?"  We test drove a '94, of another brand, that was nice, but it felt and looked A LOT older that one year older.  This car looks and feels like a much newer car.  I'm sure that it helps that it was well taken care of before we bought it and only had 63,000 miles on it, but even so, we just couldn't be happier.  When we brought it home, my family instantly loved it as well.  They had been teasing us about looking at granny cars, but they don't feel that way about this one.  Everyone thinks it is the best car we have ever owned.
