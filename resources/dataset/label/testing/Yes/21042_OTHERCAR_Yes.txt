            I bought my tracker from my father about 6 mths ago. He owned it for four years and never had a problem. The first owner only drove it in the winter. I have the 4x4 version with a hard top and a soft top. The hard top is black and the soft top is white. The tracker is green. I have about 60,000 on it now and have put 10,000 on myself. As I said my father never had a problem with it, only thing he ever did to it was new brakes in the front and oil changes. It really is not that uncomfortable, I took it on a long trip and found it to be great for the ride. I have buckets seats in the front and a bench in the rear. The convertible top lacks convenience in its removal. I have it down to about 6 minutes to take down and about 4 to put up. But, it is not one you drop at the stoplight. I pulled a 28' pontoon boat out of the river with it!! But it will not pull a trailer worth a darn. Not even a small trailer. It has a hard time finding a gear to stay in, lot's of shifting. So, I built a little rack to fit into the trailer hitch receiver. The rack holds my large cooler and works great. I have been off road with it many times and it seems to take the abuse well. It is hard to find a "convertible" that is 4 wheel drive. I plan to use it for deer hunting this year instead of my ATV. It is much warmer, yet will still fit on the trails. I have not been able to get it stuck...anything I can't drive through I can back out of. I get an average of about 25 mpg. It is easy to park. I work in the big city. Great in traffic. Wish it had A/C. I have seen many different styles of soft tops on trackers, some look more user friendly than the one I have. On the long trip I took, we averaged about 70-75 mph and it had no problem keeping up with the rest of the group. Although it looks like it will roll over easy, it will not. It feels very stable in fairly high speed cornering. The short wheelbase has its drawbacks, the speed bumps on my block work well. I am looking into air deflectors for the door windows because it is very windy inside with the windows down. It actually sucked a can of pop out of the can holder while on the freeway (with the top down). What a mess that was. There seems to be plenty of after market accessories available. I saw a locking box that fits behind the rear seat for dry, secure storage. I have the fancy, multi color seats, which add a lot to its looks. Has truly been a trouble free vehicle. Happy driving !!
