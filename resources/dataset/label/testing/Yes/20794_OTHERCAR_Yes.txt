     Cadillac, the name itself conjures images of prestige and power, and the Fleetwood is a proud bearer of that tradition. I have broken down some essentials of this vehicle to review, and they are:
1)appearance
2)handling
3)MPG (or lack thereof)
4)stereo
5)repairability

APPEARANCE
   This is a good looking car. The 1990 model is not quite as boxy as the later models and has a &quot;smoother&quot; feel to it. My Fleetwood has the gold logos and lettering against a midnight blue background, nice! If you are considering buying this car be sure to check that the aforementioned logos and lettering are in place solidly. The interior of the car is amazing. The leather seats are like a pair of lazy boys behind a windshield. Both front seats are fully powerized to adjust to the comfort
of any passenger, and the driver seat is heated as well. When buying note the condition of the seats, this is a good indication of the care the previous owner has put into the car. If the seats are badly worn and dirty
most likely the previous owner took little care of the easy things so you can guess that they probably didn't take care of major ones either!
HANDLING/RIDE
    The Fleetwood is a very big car, yet its handling is respectable. This is not the car for darting in and out of heavy traffic, however I have driven through midtown Manhattan during the day and found no problems with manueverability. The sheer size of this car will give you the right of way in most instances, also I have found other drivers will give you more respect when you are driving a Cadillac. On the highway is where the Fleetwood is at its best. This car was designed for ultimate comfort when traveling and it reaches this benchmark. It literally feels like riding in a cloud when on the open road. The V8 4.5 liter engine is capable of breaking local speed and traffic laws with ease, and this engine tells it has more to give even when inching toward 80+ MPH.
MPG
     It's a gas guzzler. Conspicuous consumption of super unleaded gas is what this car is about. It is not an inexpensive car to operate. If you are concerned with MPG, buy a Yugo!
STEREO
     The factory sound system in the Fleetwood is superb. The system is made by AC Delco/Bose and has six speakers, 4 in front, 2 in back. It has a full bass kick and excellent clarity. The front load cassette deck is a little awkward at first, but all controls are easily read and operated. You have the ability to program 8 FM and 4 AM stations, and it's easy to do.
REPAIRABILITY
    This is important, as you will need to replace parts occasionally due to wear. The Fleetwood has many similar parts to the Sedan de Ville, this means an abundance of parts available for Caddys. Also, most parts are stock at many auto repair stores such as Pep Boys.
OTHER
    Incredible amount of trunk space, cruise control, large, lighted glove compartment, soft close automatic trunk, back wheel covers.
     When you own this car people will call you a gangster and a pimp and so forth, but see it for what is, unadulterated jealousy!<br><br>
