            The Olympus C-3000 is my second foray into the digital camera market.  My first purchase, a Sony was an unmitigated disaster, so this time I went for a manufacturer with some background in the photographic world, Olympus.

This is an idiot proof easy to use camera that does not require the engineering Ph.d you need to operate the standard Sony camera.  It has been designed to feel and function just like a regular 35mm, point and shoot. 

It comes with fully automatic and focusing, the option of manual shutter control, and a top knotch 32-96mm zoom lens.   It doesn't take long at all to master and you will be taking top quality shots in no time flat.  This camera is also surprisingly light weight given all the bells and whistles that come with it including the ability to take multiple shots back to back and record short bursts of video!

The real benefit of this camera can only be realized when you get home to your computer (Mac and PC compatible) and start to play with your shots.  You can do all sorts of neat things including compression for storage and web posting and high resolution for printing.  When you see the quality of the prints you will indeed ask yourself if this camera is indeed a digital. Also, get Adobe PhotoDeluxe when you buy this camera!!

Pack extra batteries, you're going to need them for all the fun this camera will give you.
