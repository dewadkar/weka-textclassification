            I love my Honda Accord! My husband bought me this car a year ago, and it has been a great reliable, comfortable, and quiet car! My family of four rides in comfort and style. It gets great gas mileage and the car stays clean! I love riding in style! The air bags and child safety locks were a definite plus feature for this car, and a reason we bought it. This car will stay in our family for quite awhile, or until we get a newer model year of the Honda Accord. I have driven a honda for many years and have never had any problems what so ever.<br><br>
