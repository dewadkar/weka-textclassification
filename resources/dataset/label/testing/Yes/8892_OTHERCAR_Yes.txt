                You know how when you are driving down the road and you see a new stylish sports car? And you automatically look at it and wish that you were the one driving it? Well this is one of those cars! 

    I just love this car! I saw them a lot but I never knew what they were called. Until my friend told me! And I wanted one soo bad! So I asked my dad if I could get one for my first car. And we looked around for one.

    We found a really nice looking one. So we went to check it out. My dad and I took the car for a test drive..and for that time that I was in that car....I loved the way that people would watch it! And for that little bit of time people were wishing the same thing that I had too been wishing! 

    The stereo in the car was awesome! The seats were very comfortable. And it was just an all around great car! I think that this would be an excellent car for a teenager or someone in their 20's.
