            Land Rover's slogan, 'Best 4x4 By Far', says it all.  This vehicle is well appointed with useful features and durability in mind.  Off road performance is exceptional, on road performance is adequate.  Although Jeeps, Explorers and Blazers may perform well (better than the Discovery)on dry pavement, the Discovery excels in inclement weather conditions and especially off road.  What truly makes the Land Rover special is the 'Safari Vehicle' feel and look.  Rovers have been roaming the wild terrain for 50 years and everything about the vehicle has been developed because of that fact.  The body is solid inside and out.  The vehicle is made using aluminum instead of steel for better weight distribution (it will never rust).  The engine has been developed with torque rather than horsepower in mind, it's not fast but powerful enough to do the job.  The interior is roomy but the rear seats may be a bit small for larger passengers.  One great feature of the Discovery is the 'Theatre' style seating, the rear seats are higher than the front seats.  The rear half of the vehicle also has the distinctive 'hump' with side glass panels, this makes the Discovery feel much larger inside than it really is.  In warmer climates the second air conditioning unit with separate rear controls is useful (there are actually two air conditioner compressors).  One of the most important aspects of a Land Rover though is reliability.  Again, with the off road and Safari aspect in mind, Land Rover has produced a vehicle that, in my opinion, is one of the finest pieces of automotive machinery made.  I have 10,000 miles on my Discovery and my only visits to my dealer was for 2 oil changes.  In comparison my Ford Taurus has been to the dealer 8 times in 9,000 miles.  And as far as dealers go, it just doesn't get much better.  The service is exceptional with a knowledgeable and helpful staff.  And oh yes, one of the best things about the dealers is the excursions that they organize for Land Rover owners only.  The off road experience I had made me a Land Rover lover for life.  If you are looking for a good, durable and somewhat nostalgic vehicle then the Land Rover Discovery is for you.            <br><br>
