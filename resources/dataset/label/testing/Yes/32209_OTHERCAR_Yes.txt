                 I bought my first new car in June 1999. I have always loved Cavaliers having first been introduced to GM small cars by a 1984 Citation.As this 95-2001 is almost a direct replacement for that Citation in size weight and room;I knew it was the perfect car for me.
     Unlike some posts, I DO get up in the a.m. looking forward to my morning commute. The car is the perfect size for breezing through L.A. traffic and a pleasant place to be when stuck in a traffic jam.And while it does seem tractor like after hopping from my friend's Maxima back into it,the Cavalier doesn't pretend to be anything else but honest, well made transportation with good styling, comfortable seats a smooth ride willing engine and loads of safety features for the price;sort of like the way full size Chevys were before they became bargain basement Cadillacs.
     I got mine at Rydell Chevrolet-Buick-Pontiac in Van Nuys. I paid 11,808 new. The price included:abs, air, 4 speed auto w/traction control,power steering, brakes,spoiler,preferred equip. pkg.#1 and WITHOUT[thankfully...how do you spell TROUBLE?] power windows or an OHC engine with a rubber timing belt that would have to be changed at 60,000 miles.Great price,great little car and a nice ride. It's stark raving white,and will be turning 12,000 miles tomorrow.
     Sat. we'll be driving up to the central Oregon coast. Can't wait for this road trip and to take on the twisties near Mt.Shasta!
     Peeves:yes the interior furnishings are cheap, a common and consistent flaw, but I knew that going in.MORE BLOODY SOUND DEADENING GM!This car is too nice to allow so much road noise[I think it's the all season tires ].It's quieter than the Ford Contour though.Where's the V6???Where is the youth marketing?
     Truth be told I especially like the &quot;yestertech&quot; engineering. My other car is a 63 Plymouth Valiant w/3 speed manual ON THE COLUMN and no power anything.I like the proven OHV engine, it's got a nicer sound than the 2.5 litre used in so many GM cars of the 80's.I like the retro like styling w/ hints of the 75 Monza and Camaro, with a touch of 59 Impala in the tail lights. I have gotten nearly 35 mpg.on the open road[I keep records on my vehicles]and am looking forward to this long trip to see what it does.
     Safety?Lab crashes and static barrier tests aren't real world data;I went from a car without:ABS,airbags, door reinforcement,safety cage construction or traction control to one with ALL those features so the safety factor is relative.How safe is safe?I'm 1000% better off with those features than without.What's the problem? 
     I love this car. A little old fashioned,cute but crude....but then so am I!<br><br>
