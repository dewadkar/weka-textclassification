            My parents have a Ford F250 Super Duty Crew Cab Truck and if I could afford one, I'd have one myself.  This is the &quot;Truck of all Trucks!&quot;  I've driven it a couple of times, and rode in it a number of times, and I must say that it drives just like a luxury car!  It's smooth ride!

It has a lot of room and is comfortable on long trips.  It's a diesel, so it's a little noisy, but I really don't mind that.  They have a long bed, so at times it can be a little tough to park, but other than that, there is nothing negative about this vehicle.  Ford hit the nail on the head with this one!

When we go to the lake, we are all able to ride together since it has so much room!  And you can't even tell that you're pulling a boat behind you!

So, if you have a large family, but need a truck, I suggest that you look into one of these!  Like I said if I could afford it, I'd have one myself!<br><br>
