             First off, this is my fourth Kodak digital camera, despite the fact that I have owned, or had the extended use of, several other brands of digital cameras, I always seem to come back to Kodak.

  Kodak has really done an excellent job with the new DC4800! Good looking and very functional, with razor-sharp  pictures as well as having the ability to use an aperture controlled mode, as well as fully automatic mode is just one of the many features which I am enjoying. Another really nice feature is an adjustable diopter in the viewfinder lens; this is very convenient for eyeglass wearers. On the "firmware" end, there are white balance adjustments (I leave it in the automatic mode), color saturation and effect adjustments, 6 file size adjustments ranging from 0.8 mega pixels up to a whopping 3.1 mega pixels, uncompressed! There are 3 different exposure metering options, spot, center weighted as well as "multi pattern". Sharpness, ISO as well as exposure can be adjusted and you can time/date stamp your images as well. All of these adjustments are carried out in the LCD preview screen on the back, which happens to be very bright and sharp. Plus /minus exposure time is set by an analog dial on the top part of the camera. There is a pop up flash on the top of the camera; you must manually pop it up via the switch in order to use it. Speaking of the flash, I have read other opinions that some reviewers are not happy with it as it can be ineffective at long distances, especially with the zoom on the high telephoto mode. This is due to the fact that a when a zoom lens gets extended, the lens aperture will actually shrink, due to the optic magnification (i.e.: f4 at 2X becomes f8).  At this time I know of no digital camera which has flash compensation for zoom mode. The best solution to this is to try not to zoom in while using the flash. There is also a slight parallax issue when you use the optical viewfinder. This is easily compensated for as long as you're aware of it. Naturally, it is not an issue if you decide to use the LCD preview screen for your viewfinder; however, this will significantly shorten your battery life between charges.

  Access to the compact flash card is at a side door, close to the on-off switch, the other side has an access door for the transfer of files via USB (cord included) video out (cord included) as well as the charger-ac adapter (also included) Speaking of the charger, the camera uses a proprietary NIMH battery, about as big as a penlight battery and I am happy to say that a charge lasts very well, with much more capacity than my trusty and beloved DC280's 4 penlight NIMH batteries ever did. On the subject of flash cards, the 16mb card that comes with the camera is a bit too small for 3.1 mega pixel use. I suggest going out and getting at least a 64mb. Right now, these are inexpensive, a name brand one goes for about $50.00 at warehouse clubs and discounters.

 The case of the camera is very comfortable to hold, and it is very light. Unfortunately, it is all plastic, but at least it appears to be a very good quality plastic. It is also quite modern looking and attractive, without looking like something from Star Wars, it is not intimidating looking in the least to the novice user.
 The camera is very easy to use, all controls are places in logical and human friendly locations, the only exception may be  that the on-off switch seems to be in a spot where the shutter button would usually located on a 35 mm. camera. I, as well as other DC4800 owners have noticed this, but it is easily overcome quickly. I am also happy to see that this camera has quality coated glass optics and much less "barreling and pin cushioning than a lot of digital zooms which I have used.

...And.. The pictures are sharp and FANTASTIC! The most important thing!

 Kodak throws in software for photo manipulation and printing; in all honesty, I have not even tried it as I have not been too thrilled with any of the past versions. Many of these software packages default to saving files to a proprietary format, such as flashpix. I prefer JPEG.  I am "hooked" on Paint Shop Pro as well as a lesser known software known as EZ viewer 3 which comes from a company called GJC software. Their web address is www.gjcsoftware.com, for those who may be curious. Kodak also provides a small sample of their photo quality printing paper in the box, along with the manuals, solicitations and warranty stuff. 

I am also happy to report that I have shot over 1100 exposures with this camera, it has worked great, without any glitches at all!

  Whichever camera you choose, I hope you enjoy digital photography as much as I do. It's fun, somewhat instantaneous and with a good software program and printer, you will control exactly how YOU want your pictures to look not some person who is unknown to you and your family.
