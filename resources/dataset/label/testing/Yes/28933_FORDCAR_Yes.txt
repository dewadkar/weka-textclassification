            The Ford Explorer is an inexpensive, luxurious sport utility vehicle.  The Explorer is spacious and makes a great investment.  When I first saw my Explorer, I fell head over heels for it.  They are just lovely cars.  The Explorer provides heavy duty storage for all my shopping and camping needs.  I think out of all this, the technology Ford installs in its products provides the greatest amount of money saved.  With the vehicle the passengers in the back can also enjoy the luxury of warm air in the winter and cool air in the summer with the separate air/heating systems.  Also if my passengers in the back choose to listen to music while I want to enjoy the peace and quiet they can easily install head phones and listen to what the want. <br><br>
