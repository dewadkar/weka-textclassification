            Ever since I was 15, I've wanted a Mustang Convertible. Well, this year I finally bought one. I'm 23 now, and by no means a car aficionado. So, keep this review in the perspective that it comes from, which is that of a normal, every day consumer. 

So, what does a normal consumer have to say about her low-end, high option pony car. Well, I really, really love it. It's great! Being the picky person that I am, and a first time buyer, I special ordered my car so that I could get the features I wanted on it. I ordered a silver 2000 mustang v6 convertible, with leather interior, the 16 inch alloy wheels, the mach stereo system, anti-lock brakes, traction control, rear spoiler, etc. It is a pretty decked out base model. 

I stayed away from the GT, even though everyone says I should have gotten one, because it was a few thousand dollars more for performance I didn't need. Also, it's much more of a gas hog, and when I placed the order for the car, the gas prices were up into the 2 dollar range for mid-grade gas. OUCH! 

I love pretty much everything about the car. My boyfriend, who is quite a bit taller than me, wishes the seats moved back farther, and my mother says I don't have enough trunk room. Other than not being able to carry large boxes and construction supplies in the back of my car, it pretty much does everything I need.

Also, it is extremely fun to drive. It handles beautifully (although the solid rear axle makes it bumpy in the construction areas near my apartment), turns on a time, and the pickup is great. The interior is really comfortable, and the leather seats are fantastic. The 8 speaker sound system provides great sound, and the CD player works great. I love that it will pause in the middle of the song when you shut down the car, and start right up in that spot when you restart the car.

The automatic top comes up and down nice and fast, and you even have time to put the top up at a stop light if it starts to rain. 

Despite my doubts, it actually does fit four people in the car, and none of them developed claustrophobia after riding with me. 

The car looks, drives, and runs great. It's got about 4500 miles on it so far, and everything is fine.

I have a few minor things I will mention, even though none of them overly upset me. 
- there is fairly poor visibility for a short person with the top up (not a big deal b/c you buy a convertible to put the top down, right?!)
- headlights come on when you pull out a knob, only you have to pull it out fully. if you only partially pull it out, it only puts on your parking lights. sometimes, i think i've pulled it out, but it's really on my parking lights. a minor pain
- glove box is tiny!
- gas compartment can be opened by anyone. i prefer a switch inside the car that pops it open.
- i get wind burn on my face from driving with the top down (but i guess that's my problem! :) )

My only real beef with this car is the hoops I had to jump through from Ford. I make good money, and had a hefty down payment, but they still tried to ring me through the wringer. It upsets me that my boyfriend had to step in even though I was the one purchasing the car. That's for a different review though. The car, itself, I love, and its great!<br><br>
