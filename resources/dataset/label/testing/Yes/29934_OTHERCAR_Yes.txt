            This is part two (of three) of my opinions on American cars. I spent the last summer in the US and had the opportunity to do some sightseeing and driving in rented cars.

The first car I rented was the Chevy Blazer (I encourage you to review my opinion on it). The second was the Chrysler Grand Voyager and the last one the Oldsmobile Alero (coupe).

I had the Grand Voyager for as long as 10 days and made about 2000 miles in it. I established a love-hate relationship with this car, but on the whole I have to say I quite liked it. It was a somewhat different experience from the one I had with the Chevy Blazer, but the cars are also different.

While the blazer is an all-terrain SUV, the Grand Voyager's main task is to provide it's owner/user with as much room on 4 wheels as possible. And this job - it has to be said - is done by Chrysler's Grand Voyager quite well.

Things I liked about the Grand Voyager:

- <b>size</b>; bigger in size than the Blazer, the GV still proved to be quite easy to drive and maneuver. I had no difficulties driving it in traffic nor on highways. But parking it was a different story, especially when I was forced to find my way into an open space driving backwards.

- <b>comfort</b>; this car is very comfortable. The seats are different form those you usually find in passenger cars. They are bigger and taller. GV offers lots of leg and shoulder room for bot the driver and front passenger as well as for those riding on the rear bench. Seats are comfortably soft and well shaped. The air conditioning could be more efficient, but nevertheless worked sufficiently well.

- <b>versatility</b>; you can arrange the interior in a few ways. You don't have separate seats (as you would if you bought an European Van), so all you can do is to fold/unfold the rear benches (there were two benches in my GV; so I had three rows of seats). You could also completely remove them. Doing is is fairly easy but required some effort. Except that I had a lot of storage space to use. The trunk is enormous and yet again (as in the Blazer) there are lots of holders for anything you would wish to put in them.

- <b>performance</b>; again I was a bit surprised how quick it can be, when pushed right. Taught by my experience with the Blazer I did not underestimate the car by it looks. It also wasn't as soft and did not develop such amounts of roll as the Blazer.

What I did not like:

- <b>gear-box</b>; it did stupid things and changed the gears where there was no apparent need for doing it. Yes it was an automatic. I hate them.

- <b>lack of character</b>; this car has no personality. It's as dull as a white sheet of paper. What you make of it depends entirely on you. But you have to try really hard to make this car anything but a bus.

- <b>visibility</b>; the Grand Voyager has a lot of glass all around it, so you might think the driver is able to see well in all directions. Nope, not this time. It is very difficult to drive backwards - you can only rely on the side mirrors, and that doesn't show you what's directly behind you. You also have a faulty impression of the distance to whatever might be behind the car. But the view forward and to the sides was perfect.

Summing up: a great car for a big family or a bunch of friends doing a trip. I can't think of any other reasonable purposes this car could serve. An all-rounder it is not. Nor is it (IMHO) a suitable car for every day home-work-home commuting. But if you like it, then why not.<br><br>
