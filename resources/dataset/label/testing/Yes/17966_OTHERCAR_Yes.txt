            So, you've decided to buy a jeep.  Might I recommend you stick with the newer models? They have a better suspension, heating system, and stereo system. Anything after 1998 model year will satisfy you and your family.  One of the surprising recommendations I received prior to buying our first Jeep was the one about air conditioning.  I couldn't believe anyone would consider even putting air conditioning in one!  Surprisingly, it was the best advice we received.  The addition of the cooling system made the normal heating system even twice as powerful as it would have been without it.  We are very comfortable in both the summer and the winter now, even on the days we can't be four-wheeling on the beach.
   Everyone I know wants a jeep.  People come up to me in shopping malls, gas stations, and several have tried to flag me over on the road to let me know how badly they want a jeep.  On warm days, I can go outside and within five minutes have a convertible to drive.  Sometimes I leave the top up and remove all the windows- what a blast on the highway.  No air conditioning needed- even on the hottest of days.
    Finally, you might want to invest in a seat belt securer for the passengers in the back seat.  Sometimes, it gets a little windy back there and the passengers get beat to death from the seat belts.  At any rate, enjoy your jeep.  You'll never have so much fun!!<br><br>
