            Jeep has successfully produced some of the best vehicles ever assembled. The Grand Cherokee, which is a heavily suped up version of the classic Cherokee, is an outstanding, reliable automobile. It is a very spacious, and very durable car. It hasn't given me a problem as of yet. It's body style is also sleek, and almost trendsetting. (It's a wonder other companies haven't copied it yet!) It is very powerful, and relatively quiet. Only noise it makes is when you start it up. It is unbelievably comfortable. In my opinion, it is the type that you could live in. With certain options added, this becomes the ultimate SUV! This one is a king among kings.<br><br>
