            Ok...our family has had a 94 Accord since, well, 94.  It's a nice little car.  Well, not too terribly little, but you know what I mean.  It's cute, comfy, has a nice quiet ride, drives smoothly...all of that stuff.  There's only been two faults with it in our entire ownership of it.  #1, it has that new air conditioning system (y'know, the one without freon).  It acts kind of weird.  Every year the car has to be taken back to have the thermostat on the a/c adjusted because when summer rolls around again, the a/c just isn't cold anymore.  And cold air is a must here in the south.  Other than that my only complaint is that with only 2 doors, it's kind of hard to squeeze an infant seat in and out of the back.  Lucky for me that's not our main mode of transport with the baby seat.<br><br>
