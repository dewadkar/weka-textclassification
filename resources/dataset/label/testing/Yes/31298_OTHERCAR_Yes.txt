            When our Honda Accord EX Wagon started getting a little long in the tooth recently, we decided it was time for a new buggy. We�d always liked the safety features with Volvos, but never considered one (too expensive). Honda stopped making Accord Wagons (we like that car a lot), so we stopped in at the local Volvo dealer (after extensive Web research) and checked out the new V40 wagon. The verdict: too small for carting around aging parents in the back seat.

Instead, we asked the salesperson (a great lady, Judith) to secure a 1999 leftover V70 Wagon. We wanted a base model, and she found one in our price range. A metallic silver version, with graphite leather, winter package, alloy wheels and a CD player. We didn�t really want the alloy wheels (expensive to replace) and the CD player (we already had a good one that goes both in and out of the car), so they took the extras off, saving us $900. We bought it, and in the past three weeks, it�s like driving a dream. We even battle it out to see who gets to drive (me or my wife). Why would you want an SUV if you can get a V70? Tough question.

We checked out VWs (the sleazy sales guy looked right past my wife at the door � big mistake!) and Subaru Outbacks (too small for the money).  But in the end, the Volvo was the best choice. Call us Yuppie scum, but with an 8-year-old, we feel more secure. And the car offers a tremendous driving experience. If you�re considering a wagon and can afford the V70, go for it!
