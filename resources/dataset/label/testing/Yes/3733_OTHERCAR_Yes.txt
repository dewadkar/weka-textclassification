            I just bought a 2000 V8 (with A/C) Automatic Silverado. $17,400 + 3.9% financing = inexpensive truck (July 2000 Maher Chevy in st. Pete Florida).  The dealer added a bedliner, cruise control and 2 (34 gallon) tanks of gas for no extra charge.  After 2000 miles I am still happy.  The 4.8 liter V8 (270 HP!) works well.  The truck is fast and often gets better than 20 MPG.  The A/C is fantastic.  The A/C unit has an insulator wrap (like some people use for their home water heaters to retain heat) around the evaporator (the thing that looks like a scuba tank?) under the hood.  The result is A/C that stays nice and cold for a long time after it is shut off.  The engine has 8 ignition coils mounted on the valve covers just a few inches from the spark plugs (one for each plug) and there is no distributer.  Four wheel ABS disk brakes are a standard feature for Chevys, not Ford or Chrysler.  

The only V8 regular cab Silverado available on the lot was a Longbed, 2 wheel drive model (No posi-track).  I really would have liked a shrotbed V8 with a Posi, and the tires spin way too easily now. 

My story is not all good:  The salesman told me that this truck would cost $16,800 + TTT.  The manager added a $260 dealer charge and slipped in an extra $1000 for a life insurance policy to pay for the truck if I die.  Tearing my check up and attempting to leave the dealership caused them to reconsider (I still paid the dealer charge, I am new at this stuff. I also lost the $500 cash back to get 3.9% GMAC financing).  Do not buy life insurance for an auto loan or a mortgage.  These policies are rip offs.  Buy regular life insurance if you want it, you will get a better deal.<br><br>
