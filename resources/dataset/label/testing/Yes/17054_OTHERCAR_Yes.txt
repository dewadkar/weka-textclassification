            We've had our Durango for almost 2 years now and it runs like a top! After a lot of looking around the Durango's unique looks caught our eye and we were very pleasantly surprised by the price when we stopped in to see one at the dealer.  We wanted a vehicle with good towing capacity, good looks, and at a fair price.  We liked the Tahoe/Yukon but they were too big and were about $3000-6000 more than a comparably equipped Durango.  My wife was a little intimidated by the bigger sport utility vehicles so this one made sense.

The only motor available in our area with the package we wanted was the 5.2 liter V-8.  It's plenty powerful but I would have liked the 5.8 at the time.  However, after towing a 4500 pound car and trailer 800 miles on flat terrain I think the 5.2 is enough for all but those with the most severe towing needs.  I think even the 5.2 beats the other SUV's in acceleration tests.  We had our first snow since owning the Durango and it was almost worth it's weight in gold!  I pulled 2 neighbors out of snowbanks and was able to drive through the worst areas in town without fear of getting stuck.  The 4-wheel drive is not push button but even my wife is able to engage it easily from the driver's seat (and she has a herniated disk in her back).  The seats work just as easily as they do in the commercials.  You can even fit uncut 2x4's down the middle if you cover the center console with a blanket!  The only thing I don't like about the Durango now is that too many people have them!  Guess that proves that it really is a great truck at a reasonable price.<br><br>
