            There's really not much to the Honda CRX.  It's small, low to the ground, easy to drive, and gets exceptional gas mileage.  I own a 91 HF CRX.  The CRX comes in three models, the HF being the most basic.  The SI has the most features, including a sun roof and more horsepower, and several others.  

Most CRX's have no back seat, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your situation.  As a college student, it's a huge plus for me.  The back is spacious enough to haul things, and I very rarely have to carry more than one other person.  It also makes a good &quot;second car&quot; for those who want something reliable and quick to drive for any reason, beit winter transportation of quick trips around town or to work.  I'm pretty tall, so the lack of a back seat actually gives me more leg room in the front.  The seats are low to the ground, so my head doesn't hit the roof.

They're relatively inexpensive.  Mine had 170k miles on it when I bought it, and I paid 1200.  Insurance isn't too bad, either.  It gets great gas mileage as well.  I'm getting about 25mpg in town, but from what I've heard that's not as good as it could be.  

There are also numerous fan sites devoted to the car, including some with a great deal of technical information such as error codes and discussion groups with informed people giving good, sound advice on any problems you might be having.  If you do get a CRX, I'd recommend searching for them on the net.

If you need a reliable, quick, sporty, attractive car with nice features (rear defogger, A/C, etc), get yourself a CRX.  <br><br>
