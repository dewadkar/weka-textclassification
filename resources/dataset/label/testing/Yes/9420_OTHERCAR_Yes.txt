            I feel great after buying my new <I>Nikon Coolpix 4500</I> digital camera. This camera cannot be described by its configuration; you will have to check it out personally and have that feeling of being comfortable. Besides Epinions.com does a good job of providing you with all the information about the hardware of the camera. Besides you can go through millions of sites on the net that give you this information

This camera is fantastic. You will need a few more accessories to make it better. Because the requirements will be different for different people. Those who go on wildlife safaris may require things such as the FISH-EYE view for more zoom. When I bought it simultaneously a bought a few accessories like the FISH-EYE. It adds a lot of fun to your camera world. There are few things that are not known by me. But this is great add-on to the Coolpix. The FISH-EYE gives a wide view for the cam.
                    					 								                 The base price of $700(In the US) and $750(In India and other countries) is considerably good but costly for the low budget ones. As mentioned in the cons section, the battery life is a bit short. I have put the third battery since I have bought it but I am not sure whether the batteries can be charged. The retailer did mention that 2CR5 batteries work on the cam but I havenï¿½t tried them though.
The lighting effects are pretty good. Do invest some bucks in an AC adapter when you want it to work on electricity provided an electricity outlet is there. I also bought a Lens hood for use when the sun is out. The <I> Nikon Coolpix 4500</I> has half a minute sound recording ability. There is a certain software that is available which can be used to convert the sound clips from the .MOV. The video ports can be used to have live action on a Television set.
 
So if your 9-month-old child starts walking or you want to remember an important incident in you life, be sure the Nikon Coolpix 4500 will be there to keep the happy moments alive forever. Go ahead and buy one now. Good luck and happy shooting	
	    
<b>NOTE</b> -As I am living in India,I bought it for $800(Including sales tax and FISH-EYE).
