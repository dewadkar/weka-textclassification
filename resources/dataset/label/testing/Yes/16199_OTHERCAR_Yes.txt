            I Love My Toyota!  I did my research before we ever went out and looked.  Consumers Report, online research, etc.  Then we went out to test drive as many mini vans as we could.  In my opinion the rest didn't come close! The ride is like a car.  I love the room i have with my van.  I have the power door which is great!  Moon roof is ok.  I never had one before, but when its open its just to noisy.  They may all be that way, I don't know.  I have been approached by total strangers that want to ask me about my Toyota.  My daughter has 2 small children and I have recommended to her that they get the Toyota Sienna for their next car.<br><br>
