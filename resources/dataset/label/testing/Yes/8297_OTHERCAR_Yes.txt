            I use the Corolla mainly for a 20 mile daily commute.  Even so, I wanted to be able to take my family of four (two teenagers) for short trips.  Previously, I looked at the Corolla, but it lacked leg room compared to other compacts I'd looked at.

My previous vehicle was a 1999 Mazda Protege.  My daughter needed a car for interviews and work and this would give her one that has been well maintained.

I test drove several cars (Honda Civic, Mazda Protege, Nissan Sentra and Hyundai Sonata).  I was ready to put a downpayment on the Sonata when we were driving past the Toyota dealer and my wife asked me if I'd test driven any Toyotas.  I told her that the back seat leg room was too small, but what the heck, we were right there.

I was pleased to see that the 2003's were just coming in and that they had put it on the Camry's old frame, making it more roomy.  When I test drove it, I was immediately impressed with its handling and overall performance.  The seats were the most comfortable of any other car I'd driven.

We did a little haggling with the dealer (we live within about 80 miles of Canada so I told him what I could buy the car for there and we settled on a price about $400 over invoice) and I bought the car.  I've had it about 3 months and I love almost everything about it.

The only real complaint is with the noise.  There is a spot on acceleration that transmits engine noise to the interior at about 40-50 mph.  Also, there is an everpresent wind noise at speeds of more than 50 mph (most of my commute is on country roads at this speed).  Given everything else, it's not too bad, but I would rate this a 10 if the wind noise was gone.
