            You need a Digital Camera ? You have just over $500 to spend ? This is the one. Forget the $799-$899 list price , as you can pick this baby up for about $560 with a little bit of work.

What will you get in return ?  You'll get a digital camera that looks like a 35mm, but will give you over 2 million pixels (thats 1760 by 1168) per picture. The photos at this high a resolution are stunning. Several times I've had to use the software which comes with the camera (Adobe Photoldelexe and PageMill)to touch up blemishes and defects in the subjects I've been shooting. Inside, outside - it doesn't matter , the quality is truly superb.

A 20MB CompactFlash memory card comes standard, which can hold 32 hi-res or just under 250 standard images (at 892 by 592 pixel). Several sites (like buy.com) are also offering free upgrades or add-ons so check them out). Download/transfer times to your PC, even with the hi-res shots are impressive, as the DC-280 uses a USB connection instead of a classic serial port. My one complaint was the battery life, which echos some other comments I've seen. In fact, my battery life was even less than most reviewers obtained - I got just over 350 shots.

You also get a sub-2&quot; LCD for viewing and shooting (1.8&quot; for the technically inclined), a good flash, and a quiet two-times optical zoom. I also found the shape of the camera very friendly, it seemed to just nestle in my hands and form a natural extension - which when you take a lot of shots is in important factor too.

Bottom line - For $550 - a great buy if you have the money and the need.

A Thought - you'll see many spots on the web where you can store photos instead of cluttering up your hard-drive. However, if you have a back-up device - like a zip or jazz drive ; why not use that instead ? You're guaranteed instant availability and you're in control.<br><br>
