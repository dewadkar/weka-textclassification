            I bought a 1995 Honda Odyssey new in 1995.  I drove it for four years and loved every minute of driving it.  The only problem I ever had was an air bag sensor that went bad which was covered under warranty.  The four doors that open like car doors was the main buying point for my wife and myself.  It is so much easier to get into a car or van if you have a door to grab onto.  All the other vans have sliding doors (the new Odyssey does too), but we liked the fact that the doors were like a car.

We also loved the way the rear seat folds into the floor.  It is so handy to be able to carry cargo and then fold up the seat and carry passengers.

The ride in our van was great.  It was large enough to give a great ride, but small enough to be nimble in traffic.

To say we loved our Odyssey would be an understatement.  We hated to part with it, but the lease was up.<br><br>
