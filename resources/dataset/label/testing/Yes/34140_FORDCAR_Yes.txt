                   I wrote this review to set a few things straight. Unless you bought a used police car it has a 302 (5 liter)
160 horsepower v-8 motor that has been around in various sizes since 1962! It has always been a good motor in all it's displacements. It is about the smallest motor that works o.k. in a full sized car. It uses regular fuel and averages about 18 mpg. I think the EPA numbers were 17/23.
This is a 1989 version I'm reviewing. I bought it new for $17,000 about $2K under list. It has 121,000 miles on it and it is now my commuter car. 45 miles each way to work and back. I average about 23 mpg on my commute and drive about 62 mph on average. Not a Freeway, lots of curves.
It handles quite well for a big car and the brakes are good. Not a great car on icy roads without some traction assistance! O.K. at 45 mph or less with street tires.
    It has 3.08 rear axle gear ratio standard and is not a fast car with this axle ratio. If you want a faster Crown Vic look for one with the towing or handling package. Dual exhaust, 3.55 axle, better cooling, etc. Rated 170hp also.
    The police package is quite different in that it includes heavier-duty everything and the 351 cubic inch motor and the miserable fuel mileage to go with it. (probably 14 mpg combined if you are lucky.)
     I have had zero electrical problems but I did have the alternator rebuilt at 115,000 miles just to be safe. It has only had one brake job 1n 121K miles but I did replace the front brake rotors recently due to brake pedal pulsation. Parts are cheap for this car compared to anything foreign or expensive. The fuel injection system has been without trouble. I change the fuel filter about once a year and keep the tank above 1/4 always. The car is starting to develop some jerkiness in the power window operation and the door locks are getting hard to operate. This is due in part to sitting outdoors since new and it wasn't driven often enough for a while. I don't recommend using performance style air filters as the OEM style are cheap and do a better job of keeping wear particles from your cylinder walls, etc. If you want a hot rod, get a Camaro or Mustang! 
     I am a big fan of 4-wheel disk brakes. Most of the time you have to have ABS brakes to get 4-wheel disks. Well worth having. The steering is a little vague on these cars as they have power steering of the older type and it is somewhat too easy. I like the newer power steering types with a little more feedback. However, you do get used to it and it is very durable. 
      The upper ball joint on the suspension is easily accessible if you reach over the front tire and feel for the zerk fitting. I use a compact grease gun with about an 8 inch long pressure hose grease all my vehicles. You don't need to turn the wheels to access the fitting in this manner. Just be sure and wear grubby clothes! 
      I installed air shock absorbers on the rear axle to make it easy to level the vehicle when carrying a lot of weight in the car. They work great! I have the air fitting under the rear bumper so it is easy to get to. Take it easy on adding air, you can blow the fittings off if you
get too "Ham-fisted".
      The air conditioning has developed some leaking of refrigerant from when the car sat too long unused. I will probably replace the R-12 with R-134A soon.
