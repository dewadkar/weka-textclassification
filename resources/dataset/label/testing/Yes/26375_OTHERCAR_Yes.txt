            I purchased my Suby 2.5RS just over a year ago.  The sticker price was $20,900, I paid $18,800 with an alarm system installed.  It came standard with all-wheel drive, AC, PW, PL, Sunroof, 4-wheel disk brakes with 4-wheel anti-lock, cruise, CD-cassette stereo system, fog lights, tilt steering, dual airbags and 3 point seat belts in the rear seat.  I live in New England so I wanted something with all-wheel drive but also a little sporty.  I have three children ages 12 to 7 so I also needed something practical.  The 4-door 2.5RS is perfect.  I drive for a living and I already have about 50,000 miles on the car in a year.  I change the oil and filters myself and even did a few performance modifications.  There has not been a single problem with the car, not one!  I've been getting about 30mpg on the highway and 23mpg around town so the mileage is a little higher than what they told me.  We can fit the three kids in the back and a weeks worth of groceries in the trunk and still have some room left over.  I'm a large man(6'0", 235lbs) and I feel comfortable in the car for 6-7 hour drives and have plenty of leg and head room even with the sunroof.  One drawback is the anti-lock brakes are little touchy and seem to kick in too often on wet and sandy surfaces, I was told this was addressed in the 2002 model.  The paint seems to be very thin and chips easy.  I would recommend and front end bra if you are doing a lot of highway driving.  Other than that the car has been perfect.  If shopping for a new car I would suggest looking in the spring and summer in the north, the dealers didn't seem to want to deal as much on these in the winter time because of the high demand for all-wheel drive cars.  I waited till April to purchase and saved an extra $1500 over the best deal they offered in November.
