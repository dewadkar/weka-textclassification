            We bought our 1997 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE 2 years ago. I had been looking for a specific model, and this was it: Long wheel base, roof rack, tinted windows, CD Player, Infinity Sound system, bench middle seat. Just perfect! We were happy to trade in our 1989 Grand Voyager LE, which was smoking from the tailpipe, a problem commonly seen in older Plymouth vehicles. We love this van. It is roomy, comfortable and smooth. We never did have to take advantage of the warranty. We have had no mechanical problems with this vehicle other than normal wear on tires, windshield wipers, brakes, etc. With our 4th child on the way, it is the perfect size for a larger family. I specifically like the long wheel base model, it is more attractive and has more cargo space and doesn't look like an &quot;egg&quot; like the short wheel base version. Car seats are fairly easy to get in and out, except for the rear seat, it can be tricky. The roll out seats are impossible for me to get out, it takes some strength, which is one drawback, BUT, overall I am very pleased with this vehicle and it is our 3rd Plymouth we have owned and loved. I only wish our model had the rear air, it takes a while for the air to circulate in the back and rear air should be standard on long wheel base models. Most of the newer vans coming out are taking their cues from the Chrysler van models, especially the cab forward design. We plan on trading our van in for another Chrysler product, probably a Caravan, which has more options and they look sporty. <br><br>
