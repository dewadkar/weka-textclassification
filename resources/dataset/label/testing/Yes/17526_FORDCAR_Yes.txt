            Ok so anyone who knows me knows im ExTrEmElY fussy. I mean I take it were it shouldnt even go, im so fussy.
That being said, My wonderful hubby bought this car for me for xmas of 2002. Just after we got rid of my Brand new Saturn which cost us 17k cause quote " Its boooring, and it looks cheap"

 So we trek on down to the car lot in 27C degrees, so Dawn can trade her car and get A better one. We had done no investigating, on quality, or safety. I just up and decided it was time for A new car that morning, so we got one. And let me tell you we are not wealthy in any capacity, my husband is A SSGT. In the US.ARMY. So you know we are broke. But im just that spoiled.



So after wheeling and dealing forever, We drive out with this adorable little car. It was only 10k can you believe that!! For that price it looked WAY more classy inside than any of the other cars under 20k, the interior is Black and Charcoal Velour, and Black Letherette. Which if kept taken care of looks gorgeous. And remember im fussy fussy fussy,if even the slightest squeek or rattle  is noticeable back to the lot it goes. But this car is So very roomy. I have 2 kids in Car seats still and there is still plenty of room in the back for A full sized adult to fit comfortably.
The sound system is very exceptional for being stock. All of the option available for such A lower priced car are awesome. We have it all, power everything, lots of pick up and go power, great gas mileage, and it is just darn fun to drive. It has excellent head room, which makes it feel even roomier. And the best part is the maintnance and up keep are cheap. I currently have 65k miles on mine. And yes it is just now A year old, Since my husband  is ALWAYS deployed ( bless his heart) im driving from Fort.Campbell Ky, To Long beach, Ca at least once every 3 months.For those of you who dont know the distance between my house in Ky, to my familys in Ca. it is 3268 miles one way.  I have never had one single problem, not ONE!! It drives beatifully, handles well in snow, ice, rain etc...... Great control, corners very well. Short of new tires and oil changes it needs no maintnence. It is awesome, I definitly recommend it to familys, teenagers (great ideas), commuters, it is great for everyone..

Update..............
Ok guys just A few more quick notes. I must feed the demand to know more, and baby im gonna tell  ya.

Now originally I thought my Focus was extra special not just casue I was in it, but becasue It looked like no other vehicle. The body styling is alot more sleek for cars in this price range. Which was great, now it is much more common but still A great car to look at and drive in. I cant tell you how smooth the ride is.....You can be going 110mph on the frwy, and not even notice becasue the ride is just that smooth. And unfortunatly for my hubby, I have gotten 2 speeding tickets doing just that. Oops!

This little car can go, it will do 150mph. Now that in now way is safe speeds for the fwy. But if your like me, and llive in the stix (thankyouverymuch Uncle Sam) then you can let her rip on A dirt road in the country and have the time of your life. My previuos car was A Jeep Grand Cherokee Limeted Ed. That was 3 times the price of this, and I didnt have even half as much fun in it.Now for just one last thing I want to add. Have you ever gotten into A vehicle and felt like you needed Yoga classes to do it. You are basically crawling into and out of it. Well not this car the body sits higher so you are actually stepping into the car instead of crawling, which I get sooo many complements on from those big soldiers im alwasy taken place to place.LOL. 

So go out, buy on and love it!!
