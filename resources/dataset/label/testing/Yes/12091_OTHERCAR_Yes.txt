            I have recently relocated to an area where a 4-wheel drive vehicle is highly recommended.

  I called a friend who sells cars and asked if they could hook me up with a 4-wheel drive vehicle under $20,000.00.  Much to my surprise at first glance you laugh but then when you get behind the wheel of the Grand Vitara you fall in love with it. Not only is it cute and small but a lot of fun to drive. This little SUV may not look as tough as some of the bigger SUV's but looks are deceiving.  

I use to own one of  those bigger SUV's and from my personal experience the Grand Vitara out does the bigger SUV's.  The Grand Vitara is zippier and handles those tight curves better. 

 When I have let others drive the Grand Vitara they too where surprised at what it can do. I know two other people that now want to buy a Grand Vitara and a third person that has already bought one. The Grand Vitara is perfect for those females whom are intimidated by those hogs of the road. 

Yes, it is true that great things come in small packages.  <br><br>
