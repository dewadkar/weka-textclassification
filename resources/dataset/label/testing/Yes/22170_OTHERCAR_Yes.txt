            Almost two and a half years ago I purchased my Tracer from a little car dealership.  I was looking for an automobile that would be small, have decent gas mileage, and inexpensive to purchase and maintain.  I have found the Tracer to be all of these. 

 I love that I have had to do little maintenance to the Tracer.  All that has been required is routine maintenance such as oil changes.  The only problems I have experienced with my car are the window tinting and the security light.  The tinting began to peel after only a few months.  The security light does not malfunction, but it is placed to the left of the steering wheel.  When driving at night, the light tends to be distracting, as it constantly blinks. 

 The Tracer has a smooth ride and is easy to handle.  The seats are comfortable and roomy.  The back seats lay down for access to the trunk.  This comes in handy when needing to transport an item that is long or roomy.  Anyone looking for a compact affordable car should check out the Tracer.  <br><br>
