            I am a college student and I have a 1992 Saturn SL1.  My mother bought it when it was new, and in the seven years we have had it, we have never had any major problems with it.  The only repairs we had done on it were on the sun roof, but that was an accident, and just recently we had to replace spark plugs because the oil was leaking.  And that only cost about $60 dollars.  

The car is great for me, because I do not have a lot of spending money, and it doesn't suck down gas.  I only fill my gas tank up once a week, if that, and it only takes about 10-12 dollars depending on the price of gas at the time.  That includes driving to school and work everyday, which is about 25 minutes both ways.  The car has about 90,000 miles on it so far, and I have no complaints about the way it runs.  

It is not the greatest looking car, and if I had a good paying job I would probably buy something that looks better, but for a less expensive car, the Saturn is the top car to buy.  I have the four door car, and it has plenty of room for hauling all of my stuff home for the holidays.  It is very easy to drive and to parallel park.  Obviously, a luxury car rides smoother, but the Saturn isn't a bad ride for a small compact car.  
Overall, it is a great inexpensive, durable car for a college student. <br><br>
