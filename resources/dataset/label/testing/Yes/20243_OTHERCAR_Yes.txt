            We nearly ended our marriage, trying to find a new car that was big enough to fit our tall statures.  Most of the new cars we tried, Ford, Chrysler, were so curved, that there was little head room for people like us, over 6 foot tall.  We tried them but kept hitting our heads on the ceiling, and we had a cramped, enclosed feeling.  Then we heard about the new Malibu, tried one out and loved it.  The great interior space, good looks, American Made, great price were just what we wanted.  The sporty V6 Engine, with automatic transmission on the floor made it fun to drive.  The wide oval tires, throaty exhaust, and large trunk made this driving experience a joy.  The only less than thrilling part of the car where the firm seats.  But I am confident they will soften with wear.  A great investment, with a lot of driving fun.<br><br>
