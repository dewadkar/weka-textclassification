            When it came time to buy a new car, not by choice, but rather because my old one that I'd driven since my junior year of high school had taken to dying on me in not-so-timely places, I looked around quite a bit.

A 22 year-old looking for his first NEW car can be quite a sobering experience.

I really liked the Volkwagen Jetta, the Acura Integra and the Toyota Celica. The problem with these cars was that they were running a little high on price. I was looking at paying between $20,000 and $27,000 with these cars when I felt my range was more $18,000 to $22,000. The Jetta did talk to me, with the fine German engineering and superb handling. I decided to take some time off from looking, frustrated at the difficult time I was having.

I told my salesman at Toyota to keep me in mind if he got something good.

Two weeks later I got a call from the same salesman telling me I had to come see this 99 Corolla LE they just got in. It was a factory car that only had 5500 miles on it.

I half-heartily went in to see it and was actually impressed with it. For a little car it's pretty sporty (being a little car kind of guy - having only had a Nissan Sentra previously) and well-laid out. The metallic black finish was very nice and the car handled extremely well, not as tight as the Jetta, but still very nice. The trunk is huge as well and it's more powerful than most cars of the same size. And the gas mileage! Prepare for much smaller bills at the end of the month!

My salesman and I added on a ton of features, including keyless entry/alarm system, cd player, a spoiler, and the gold package for a total price of under $16,000. 

I traded in my Sentra (and got a whole $350 for it!) and was on my way.

I've had the car for 10 months now with no problems. I have felt no buyer's remorse and if I had it to do over again I would do it the same way. Toyota makes some wonderful products and I am quite pleased with the Corolla. For students or just price conscious shoppers in general, I'd recommend it hands down.<br><br>
