                 When our previous car began acting up we decided it was time for a change.  When browsing a local lot we saw a 1995 Ford Taurus four door sedan.  We went for a drive and seemed really pleased.  We decided to purchase the car.  At that time it was about three years old.  
     We purchased it because it drove very nicely and seemed to have plenty of room.  We also phoned the previous owners and they said they only traded it in because they now had a company car and no longer needed a personal vehicle.  They told us how pleased they were with this car and how reliable it had been for them.  They said they had no doubts we would be pleased.  And we have been.  Only a time or two in the shop, but things do go wrong when you are pushing eighty five thousand miles! 
     I love the spunk it has when I need to get up and go.  I don't use that feature often, but this car can do it.  It drives very nicely and is easy to handle.  It is roomier than some other cars, however with myself, my husband, and two car seats in the back seat, not to mention the double stroller in the trunk, it doesn't leave much room for groceries, etc.  But that isn't the cars fault.  lol  
     There really isn't anything I hate about this car.  Overall we have had very good luck.
     I would say that it is a nice experience to drive a Taurus.  Not the most luxurious car by far, but it is nice.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Sedan or wagon depending on family size.  If you have the luck we have had to this point with our Taurus then you could plan to be pleased!
