            I have bought this truck almost a year ago, as part of maturation process that started with me getting married and then us buying our first house. It has been pretty reliable transportation so far and didn&#146t give me any serious problems as of yet. When I bought it, it had 122000 miles on it.

The engine in my truck is 2.2 liter 4 cylinder, since my truck is short bed and standard cab. I just never could justify needing leather seats, automatic climate control or power everything in a truck. It is strictly utilitarian machine after all. The engine is reasonably powerful, but don&#146t expect blazing performance out of it. It lets you take off from standstill fairly quickly, and maintains 70 mph on highway &#150 all you need out of a truck. The engine has its share of problems though: shortly after I bought it, the engine started backfire after releasing the accelerator pedal. Some mechanic told me that the reason is probably the small opening in the throttle body that got clogged, but I didn&#146t get around to check it out yet, since it involves removing the valve cover. It is just a nuisance though, as the truck drives fine. The bad part is the sound it makes when you stop at the stoplight and release the accelerator pedal &#150 pah&#133. Pah&#133 pah&#133 Sounds like the truck is 50 years old and never had maintenance done.
The engine is adequately powerful, but has trouble keeping up the steep hills, and requires you to downshift pretty often. But then it could be the axle ratio. I don&#146t know, but I think 115 hp engine with even more torque should not have a trouble pushing the small truck up the hill. I bought my wife 2003 VW Golf GLS with 2.0 115hp engine, and even with automatic transmission it doesn&#146t have any trouble going up the same hills. The VW is heavier too.

The transmission is 5 speed manual, shifts pretty smooth. The clutch is still original, and judging by the clutch pedal &#150 still has a lot of life left in it. Handling on the road is surprisingly smooth. It is small truck but it swallows the potholes almost seamlessly. On the rare occasion that I decide to take sharp turn it also behaves very well for a truck.

Interior could use some upgrading though. The cheap hard plastic that the dashboard is made out of is almost uncleanable and cheap gray looks awful. The seat though is different story: supportive, comfortable, and also high enough to provide ample view. At one time I made 14 hour round-trip to Baker City, OR from Kent, WA in one day, without any rest stops (besides fill-ups) and my back was fine. I also liked the floor covering using plastic/rubber combination &#150 very practical and easy to clean &#150 just wipe it off with wet cloth and you&#146re done.
