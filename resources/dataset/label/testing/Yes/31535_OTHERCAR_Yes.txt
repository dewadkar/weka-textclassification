            I originally bought this camera as a gift for my parents, but loved it so much I had to get one for myself.

The most striking thing about this high-feature camera is that it's JUST THE RIGHT SIZE!  It's small enough to fit into a jacket pocket and can almost be concealed in the palm of your hand.  But it's big enough to have a 2&quot; LCD viewscreen and an intuitive set of controls.

It takes good quality pictures (I highly recommend checking out http://www.imaging-resource.com to see samples).  The flash is a little weak, but good enough for 8-10 ft.

It takes two resolutions 1280x1024 and 640x480 and three different compression modes.  

You should be able to find this camera for around $450 online.  I bought from www.1unlimited.com and was very satisfied.

The one main drawback is...well, I'm scared what a decent drop onto concrete would do to it.  But that's probably a con for most digital cameras.

New ADDED: 7/5/00

My parents *did* drop their camera onto a marble floor.  And it bent the main imaging plate which the camera uses.  The good news is that they sent it in to Fuji and although a satellite repair site tried to charge them $250, the main repair site covered it under the warranty.  All in all, still very high on the camera!
