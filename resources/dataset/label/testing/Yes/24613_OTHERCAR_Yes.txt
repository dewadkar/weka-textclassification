            My parents gave me their Cutlass for my graduation for college.  Unfortunately, the mass air sensor went before I graduated.  It was about a $600 fix.  The good news is, that's the most problems I've had with the car.  Sure, there are cars out there that get better gas mileage, but its reliable in and of itself.  I've been driving the car for over five years now, and the mileage is getting to the 100,000 mark. I've had relatively few problems with it and definitely have an attachment to the car.  Because it has a reputation as an old person's car, many other cars are surprised with its power.  Mine has a V6 engine and definitely has pickup.  Overall, I think its a good car and I'm hoping it lasts me the next four years until I get out of law school.  It's a big car, so sometimes its hard to park.  I get about 19/26 as my gas mileage, so as long as the gas prices stay down, I'm ok.  It has a soft suspension, so I feel almost every bump in the road.  But overall, I recommend the car because of its reliability and safety.
