            If you're looking for a great value in a used vehicle, then look no further than a gently used Sebring!

I purchased my 1996 Sebring this year and I love it.  It handles nicely and looks sleek and stylish.  I don't have the convertible, but the 2 door coupe.  It's a great size for me, as I don't have a lot of things or kids to haul around on a daily basis.  It gets great gas mileage, too.

The interior is comfortable, with all controls within easy reaching distance, but is a bit cramped if you happen to be larger than the average bear.  My boyfriend is 6'2&quot; and he's cramped to say the least.  I am 5'6&quot; and it fits me perfectly.
The 4 cylinder engine leaves a lot to be desired, not a whole lot of pick up out of the chute.  I used to have a V6 and am probably used to more power.  This car handles very well in snow, too.
I like the car because I didn't have to spend a ton of money for a very reliable, good looking car. 
If you can get your hands on one, grab it.<br><br>
