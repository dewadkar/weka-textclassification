            First, let me tell you that I have owned 14 cars in the last 12 years (including cars driven by my wife).  This is the only car that I cannot part with.

I've always been a Ford guy.  So when I decided I wanted a big car, I immediately looked at Ford.  That is when I realized nobody made what I wanted....except Buick.  The Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis, while nice cars, lacked a few key features that the Buick has.  

First, the FoMoCo twins have a cheap, hard plastic interior, with door armrests that make noises when your leg rubs up against them.  The Buick interior is softer and doesn't feel like it came from a discount store.  Also, the Crown Vic has the smaller 4.6L V-8, versus the 5.7L in the Buick.  I'm a big fan of the reliability and simplicity of GM's V-8.  One other item...this seems shallow, but the cupholders in the Crown Vic seem like an afterthought.  A small tray slides out from the dashboard...it really isn't big enough for a large drink and it can hinder operation of the air conditioner.  The Roadmaster has a nice armrest/cupholder combo that holds big drinks (and small ones as well), while not interfering with any dash mounted controls.

The only other Ford product that I considered was the Lincoln Town Car.  However, while the interior quality surpasses the Crown Victoria, the TC is another foot or so longer than the Roadmaster and was $1,000 to $1,500 more for a model of comparable year and mileage.

That being said, I bought the 1992 Roadmaster in October of 2000.  It had 64,000 miles on it.  Today, it has 85,000 miles on it and I have only spent $500 in "repairs", that being a heater core.

The big V-8 (with 180 hp) gives the car plenty of pick up.  And, believe it or not, it gets good gas mileage....much better than any of the SUV's that are so popular.  In fact, on a trip from Texarkana to Memphis, I averaged THIRTY ONE miles per gallon (no A/C on).  In addition, overdrive is geared really low....at 65, the engine turns about 1400 rpm aiding in fuel economy.


The build quality is top notch.  Body panels fit well together; the car is tight with relatively little wind noise for such a square vehicle.  The one complaint I have is the grey body moulding that will not stay on.  When mine started to come off, I watched other Roadmasters...very few have all the grey moulding on them.  I lost one piece on the highway.  The other piece, well, I've used super glue, epoxy, "Bondini", and even silicone.  It fell off again yesterday.

For such a large car (over 4,000 lbs), it handles really well.  It will glide in and out of rush hour traffic.  Its size acts as a deterrent for smaller cars that would otherwise cut you off.  In all fairness, when the front shocks begin to wear, you can have a few white knuckle moments by taking a corner a little too fast.  The car starts "floating" over bumps and does not "plant" itself...that is, the car does not get settled down in the turn and you almost feel like you are going to bounce off the road.  This is easily remedied by two new front shocks (not struts, incidentally, which are more expensive).

Mine has leather interior which has held up well.  The power window buttons feel solid and have worked flawlessly (which has not been the case on a couple other cars I've owned).  The gauges are easy to read, and the inclusion of a tachometer is very helpful.  My car also has the climate control, where you can set the temperature and let the car adjust blower speed and air temperature to achieve your desired "feel."  

I will say this...this system lacks a control for "floor" and "panel", which is mildly annoying.  The system determines whether it blows out from the floor vents or from the vents on the dash by taking into account your selected temperature and the ambient temperature outside.  I would personally like a button to select one or the other...however, this is a small nit-pick and does not dampen my enthusiasm for the car.
