            I actually don't own this car, but my girlfriend does, and since I'm the one who always seems to drive it on long trips, I've probably driven it more than she does.

It's not like the Toyota Corolla is a bad car...compared to many cars it's pretty reliable (I've heard bad things about Kias and Hyanduais). But it suffers from a lacklusterness, and the Toyota name isn't the ultimate excellent end-all that some would have you believe. 

It runs smoothly, although it does lack a lot of pep. And mechanically, it has a decent track record (the only breakdown it had was a starter problem at 55,000 miles) that far exceeds its larger sister car, the Camry (a friend of mine owned a '98 Camry who's engine blew after only 16,000 miles). Its original installed brakes were horrid, however. You needed to press all the way down before you got any sort of stopping action. That made it a definete safety liability. After the new brakes were installed, they were slightly improved, although they wear out rather easily. And with its lack of zip or outstanding features, it's, well, bland.

My main complaint is the lack of leg room. The back seat does feature decent leg room. But the front seat, even pulled all the way back, must have been designed for midgets. It simpily is not a comfortable car. It isn't fun to drive for long trips. 

I would not discourage anyone from buying a Corolla, as they are not bad cars. It's just that they aren't that good, and people shouldn't buy them just because they are Toyota. (I personally think you would get a better value from either a Dodge or a Saturn, two American brands that are much better values than the overrated Toyota nameplate). If you are dead set on getting a Corolla, you might actually look at the Geo Prizm twin instead...same car, less money. Personally though, my 1994 Dodge Shadow is above and beyond this car...it did not have a single problem until after 105,000 miles, which is far superior than this Corolla.
