            I didn't really own a TT, but I have borrowed that car from my friend for a relatively long time when he was away for a business trip.  That can has a spectacular appearance. When driving it on the street, it gave me a feeling that I was ahead of everything, time, technology... The black leather seats are quite comfortable.  The only shortcoming of that car is probably the engine.  I stopped for a red light next to a volkswagen beetle.  I stepped on the gas paddle approximately the same time as the Beetle's drive and I didn't beat him in that "race".  It's kinda disturbing to know that the luxurious can that I was driving has an engine same as the Beetle.  The suspension is also very still... With 225-hp 1.8-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged five-valve engine, TT roadster is definitely a great car.
