            My husband and I purchased the 1992 Toyota Camry in 1991.  At the time we owned a 2-door Pontiac Firebird.  With a family on the way, we decided that it was time for a 4-door sedan, so that getting kids in and out of a car-seat in the back seat would be easier.  We opted to go with the LE model which was the middle option.  We didn't feel that we needed to spend the extra money for a sun roof or 6 cylinder engine.  We took the car for a test drive and instantly fell in love with it.  It was so comfortable and handled very well.  It has continued to handle well through many New England Winters!  The car is very quiet, no rattles at all.  I have even been impressed with the comfort of the back seats which I have had a few occasions to enjoy.  The trunk has been a truly amazing benefit.  It is just enormous!  You also have the option of putting down one side or both sides of the back seat to extend the trunk into the car, which is great for traveling with skiis and not having to mount a ski-rack to the roof.  I am also pleased to report that after 8 years and almost 100,000 miles later, the car is still running smoothly.  It has only been in the shop once, to have the brakes done.  We have not had one problem with this wonderful car.  When it comes time to purchase another car, which will not be any time soon, because ours is still running perfectly, I will not hesitate to purchase another Camry.  Perhaps the Solara?  Hmmmm!<br><br>
