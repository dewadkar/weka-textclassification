            After putting 180,000 miles on a 1992 VW Passat, I looked at the Jetta because my high mileage depreciated my cars too quickly. I bought a new 1997 Jetta GT sedan. I have put 120,000 miles on it, had four sets of tires (Goodyear &amp; Michelin), exhaust system, brake disks and rotors all round. This is not the same quality as the Passat, or anywhere near. However I do like the Jetta for ride, comfort, cruising on the highway is excellent, gas mileage is averaging 35 MPG city and highway. Parts are very expensive, but that appears normal today.
The trunk is huge, room in the front is ideal, but the rear seat is a little cramped for adults, but still better than most domestic cars.
VW's really hold their price, and the diesels depreciate very little.
I live in Canada and the car has performed well in deep, and packed snow over three winters, with All Weather tires. My son has 3 Jetta's, a '75 Beetle, and a '73 Westphalia, all on the road, we love our VW's...<br><br>
