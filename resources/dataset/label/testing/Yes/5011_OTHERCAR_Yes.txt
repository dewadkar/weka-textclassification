            Recently, I was forced into the horrific task of buying a car.  I decided to go with a new one since my old one turned out to be a lemon, and it was given to me by my grandmother.  So if you can't trust your grandmother, who can you trust when it comes to used cars?
Looking for something affordable, durable, and with a long lifespan, I was torn between the Nissan Sentra and the Honda Civic.  Although I wanted cheap, I also wanted a few features including air conditioning, CD player, and (potentially) power door locks.  
After having driven both of them, and researching them to the best of my ability, my decision came down to price and features.
The Sentra has a CD player, power doors and windows, keyless entry, and an alarm system that comes standard with the vehicle.  However, the Civic in the same price range came with a tape player and no power doors.  Let's be honest, who listens to tapes anymore?  
But I was still torn because the Honda still seemed bigger, had more space.  So it ultimately came down to price.  
Nissan was much more willing to bargain with me about the price and the financing.  So, between the two cars, the final price was a difference of approximately $4000.   That's a big difference to a poor graduate student.
I am extremely happy with my decision.  The Nissan people have been very helpful and service has been fantastic.  I would recommend this car to anybody looking for a compact, affordable vehicle.  It gets good gas mileage (between 26 and 34 miles to the gallon), it has great safety features, and many more extras that you would be surprised to see in a car.
