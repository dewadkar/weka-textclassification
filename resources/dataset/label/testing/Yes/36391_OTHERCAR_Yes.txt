            We bought the club cab with the V-6 and automatic transmission. A full size truck was bigger than my wife and I wanted to handle. Going from dealer to dealer looking at all the other small trucks. It left us with the opinion that for what we were looking for, the Dodge Dakota was what we wanted. It has a good size bed in it and was by far the sharpest truck on the market, inside or out. We got bucket seats with a full center console. With that console, the pockets in the doors, storage under the rear seats and glove compartment.There is room to store more stuff than I have ever seen in a truck or car before. There are three cup holders right there for you. Two of them allow you to adjust to the size of the container.The console also acts as a armrest. A little nicety that I require on any vehicle I own. They are great for long drives. With that console, you also get an extra power receptacle. Which gives you three in all.You can hook up your computer, cell phone and light a cigar and do it all at the same time.
My biggest gripes with the Dakota was with gas mileage and the tie downs in the bed of the truck. So far it's been around 15-18 m.p.g.for about 40/60 city/highway driving. There are four tie downs. The two near the cab are the worst. They are under the floor and you need to try and wrap your fingers around the bar with a rope to secure anything. The two in the back are a little easier. But the bed liner makes even those a little difficult to get at. I fixed that problem by buying four snap hooks. They are very easy to reach below the floor and clamp on to the bar. Then you can easily tie a rope or strap on to the snap hook. When not in use. Take them off and throw them under the rear seat. Anyone who has a Dakota will love those snap hooks. We have not had the Dakota long enough to tell how reliable it will be. But it's a solid truck with a good ride and nice power. It handles very nice. So far, I couldn't be happier with it.
Just to update you some since I wrote this. I now have had the truck for five months. Still have no problems with it.
Also have not gotten up to 20 MPG yet. That is with the a/c on constantly. One gentleman I see complained about the bed being small and resale bad. But he had a four door truck and got rid of it in less than a year. He should of been able to see that there was a small bed with a four door.The regular cabs and club cabs have the longest bed of all the small trucks. And expect to take a real beating  no matter what you own if your going to resell it after just a few months.Heck, you'll lose thousands as soon as you drive a vehicle off the lot. No matter what your driving. Consumers Report gives the Dakota good marks for resale value.
    
To farther update you. I have now owned my Dakota for 14 months. Have not had to take it to the shop for anything.
Still have not gotten 20mpg yet, no matter if a/c is on or off. Listening to most others on mileage. I would recommend you getting the V-8 instead of the V-6. Doesn't seem that much difference in mileage and the V-8 seems to be a lot better in take off and speed. Probably work a lot better in mountains. Still love the truck.
