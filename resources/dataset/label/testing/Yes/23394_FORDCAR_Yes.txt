            I'm the original owner of a 1996 Ford Ranger XLT Supercab truck. I got the 4.0 liter 6 cylinder engine, the manual transmission, A/C, and a few other options. As of 12/2000, I've put about 61,000 miles on the truck.

So far, it's had a few minor problems. When the truck was just a few months old, the top radiator hose had a pinhole leak which mysteriously appeared. It was tricky to figure out because it only leaked when there was positive pressure inside the radiator. Ford fixed it for free.

A year or so after that I noticed that one of my front brake rotors had a big groove in it. I didn't have that many miles on the truck so I thought it was unusual to say the least; when I took the shoe out of the caliper I found a hex-head screw embedded in the lining. Since the brake shoe was clearly manufactured with the screw there, Ford fixed it for free.

When the truck had 25,000-30,000 miles on it I noticed some funny behavior with the electronics. The windshield wiper switch was screwed and the wipers would just come on all of a sudden. As well, the &quot;door ajar&quot; light would mysteriously come on from time to time, even when the door was shut tight and I was rolling along at 70mph or so. This annoyed me but I was busy and didn't want to be without a vehicle for half a day, and on top of it my dealer closed their service department on weekends. So I procrastinated and finally broke down after the 36,000 mile warranty had passed. I took it in to have the problem fixed, but because I was 1,257 miles over the warranty period the dealer charged me $50.

Outside of these problems, the truck has been pretty good. I just paid it off and plan to keep it another five years, at least, God willing. I shelled out some $500 for the 60K service, but otherwise the truck has run very well without much service except the occasional oil change, etc. I like the power of the 4 liter engine, even if the gas mileage is usually around 17 mpg, and would have a hard time going back to a car powered by a four-banger economy engine like the one I used to drive.

I bought this truck so I could go hunting with my friend, and so far it has been quite functional in that capacity. It also comes in real handy for road trips where there is a lot of stuff to haul around, so long as there are just two occupants. The jump seats in back are tough for adults to use, so I've limited myself to just one passenger for longer trips (say, Los Angeles to San Francisco).

In spite of the minor problems I've experienced early on, I like this truck and may well buy another one. I think I'm pretty demanding as a customer, at least so far as value is concerned, and I think I've gotten good value with my purchase of this vehicle. Maybe I'll check back at 120,000 miles and update my review...

BTW, as far as other trucks are concerned, I can't claim much experience; my purchase was guided largely by the favorable review that Consumer Reports gave the Ranger, especially with regard to mechanical reliability. Personally I find GMC products to be poorly designed and of poor overall quality (I once worked for a rental car company, and I drove many, many, many cars of most makes and models), so I would probably not be interested in purchasing GMC. I don't know about Dodge trucks.<br><br>
