            The Mitsubishi Galant is Mitsubishi's sedan under the successful line of the Diamante.  The Galant is available in 5 different models: the DE, ES, ES-V6, LS and GTZ.  This review will focus on the GTZ which is the top of the line Galant available.

<b>Engine</b>
The GTZ model Galant comes with a 3.0 liter V-6 engine which produces 195 horsepower.  My brother recently traded in his 1999 Accord EX for the Galant GTZ, and I actually got to drive the vehicle home from the dealership.  When I hit the gas pedal, I was surprised at the sensitivity of the pedal.  The slightest touch to the pedal, and the car zooms off.  The 195 horsepower level is definitely ample power for this sedan.  Any driver of the Galant will be pleased with the engine and power of the car.

<b>Suspension</b>
The GTZ model has a special traction control option as well as a refined sport suspension which is only for this model Galant.  When I drove the car, I felt that it handled decent and had a nice, smooth ride.  The ride is definitely comfortable; and while you're not going to take turns at 60+ in this car, the handling is sufficient for everyday driving.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior of this car is nothing special, but it works.  Leather seating and stereo upgrades provide an enjoying ride.  The controls on the dash are definitely not too high-tech, but they service the purpose.  Infinity stereo upgrade is a great option for the GTZ.  Lumbar support controls are also available for this model.  Leg room is good in the front and in the back, so a family could definitely fit comfortably in this vehicle.

<b>Exterior</b>
The GTZ is available in four different exterior paint colors: silver, black, beige, and red.  I personally like the silver the best which is the color my brother selected for his GTZ.  The GTZ comes with 16 inch wheels that look really nice but not to extravagant.  The GTZ also comes with a spoiler which transforms the Galant in to a sport sedan.  The Galant GTZ is definitely different looking from the other four Galant models.

<b>Reliability</b>
My brother has only owned this car for a few months which will not give too much evidence to the reliability of this car, but so far, the car has been problem free.  My family has owned Mitsubishi cars before and have, for the most part, been problem free.  Mitsubishi builds a fine product and the Galant is a relatively reliable vehicle.

<b>Conclusions</b>
The Galant ranges from $17,000 up to $26,000.  Specifically, the GTZ ranges typically from $24,000 to $26,000 and maybe even a little bit higher.  The Galant is definitely a practical vehicle for those who want a nice 4 door sedan that is a quality vehicle.  For those wanting a more sporty sedan with more power, then the GTZ should definitely be considered.  The car is nothing spectacular when put up against other vehicles of the same class.  There are really no faults to this car, but I would not recommend this car for the person who wants to draw attention to themselves.  The car is a functional, practical 4 door sedan.  For the price, I think it is a great buy.  My brother and the rest of my family has been rather happy with the GTZ we've owned, and I'm sure that if you choose to own this car that you too will be happy with it.<br><br>
