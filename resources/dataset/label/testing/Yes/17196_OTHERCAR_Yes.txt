            I purchased a Maxima GLE '97 (29,000 miles) over a month ago.  It's got great acceleration and is very roomy.  However, the ride is a bit hard (stiff).  I thought it was a problem with the suspension, but I have been told that this is common with Nissan Maxima's.  It's apparently a harder ride with the SE version.  However, Consumer Reports rates the Maxima "exceptional" in reliability and this is pretty much what I was looking for when I purchased it.  It is very roomy and gas economy is very good, despite its need for premium gas.  It is a bit unstable at high speeds (80+), but cornering and handling is exceptional - the car stands it ground.  I find the transmission a bit jerky, almost undecided when attempting to switch gears (especially when driving between 20-40 miles an hour).  It's also got a lot of tourqe, letting off the gas sometimes is a bit abrupt and tends to drop the acceleration a bit - not very smooth flowing through and through.
