            My wife, two kids and I test drove a V6 Suzuki Grand Vitara. The engine was really quiet and they wanted me to get it even if it wasn't roomy in the back. Any person big or small will be very uncomfortable even on short trips. Imagine going from L.A. to Las Vegas? (The RAV4 was considered as well but the price was high if you start including a/c, auto trans, and stuff). So, I told them that we should try the CRV before making any commitments. Besides, we know that whatever vehicle we choose, the vehicle will be with us for a while.

We went to the Honda dealer and test drove the Accord and CRV. I told my wife to get the Accord instead because of the smoother engine ride, but we decided to get the CRV because of the higher visibility. It was roomy for the kids. It's got all kinds of neat things, like armrest in the back and extra cupholders all over. The car was responsive but noisy when pushed, but once you get to 70 mph it's a quiet ride. It has a long braking distance and feels like the vehicle will roll when cornering, but you get use to all of this in no time. The gas mileage is about 22 mpg, not too bad since we just got rid of a gas guzzler. We even installed a passenger armrest in about 15 minutes and added a keyless entry (from partscheap.com); worth every penny of it.

The more we drove the CRV the more we love it. I think it's a great family vehicle for us for years to come.
