            As a 20 something American Male, nothing can be more demeaning to my advertising fed testosterone laiden ego than driving a gold 1990 Volvo 240DL sedan.  It screams 'married with  2 kids' and prevents me from joining in any extreme sports (well that, and my fear of extreme sports).  HOWEVER, this is the best car that I will probably ever own.  It's dependable, safe, and will outlast my childish car buying impulses.  
I bought this car shortly after getting married, and my wife (who survived a head on collision on I-5 against a fully loaded tractor-trailer because of her mother's Volvo), turned my head from the Ferrari Testerosa which I was looking at (ya, right) towards the Volvo Dealership.  After a lot of research, my brain finally kicked in and we bought it.  What did I find that in my research that pushed me towards the 'tank of the highway'?  California Highway Patrol magazine (circa 1994) stated that the 1990 Volvo 240DL was the most crash-survivable car in the world. Every article highlighted it's dependability (sighting average lives of over 300k miles!) and overall record.  And while I have the occasional electrical problem (a documented weakness) and it's 4 cylinder engine prevents me from tearing rubber out of the stop sign by the elementary school... I CAN get to work every single day for the rest of my entire life because of this damn vehicle.  No matter what repairs that are required, they are still cheaper than new car payments and higher insurance rates.
So I say, &quot;Throw away your personality and ignore the advertisers, and buy a Volvo... it's what your brain would do if it was in control!&quot;
