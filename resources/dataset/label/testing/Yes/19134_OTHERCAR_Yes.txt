            The new Volkswagen Passat is possibly the cheapest and best luxury car out there.  You may not call it a luxury car but it is.  I have a 1999 one in silver and I love it.  I have not had any problems.  The car is spacious, has great control, and has a very quiet ride.  I love the look and would recommend it to anyone.  The Passat is priced less than most luxury cars which is also a great feature.  I had shopped around and this is much better than a BMW and even a Mercedes.  So trust me, go out and buy the new Volkswagen Passat.<br><br>
