            <b>Buying the car</b>
Toyota Siennas come in a wide variety of ways.  The base model is the CE, which runs in the low 20's and isn't equipped very well.  The mid-range LE trim is the most popular.  It is has more goodies than a CE does, but it runs in the mid to upper 20s range, depending on how many options you decide upon.  The XLE trim is the luxury trim with many standard features.  Priced in the upper 20s and low 30s, it is somewhat expensive.  All Siennas come with a 4 speed automatic transmission, and a 3.0 liter V6 producing almost 200 horsepower.  
   My parents bought a new 1999 Toyota Sienna early in the year.  This was the car I learned to drive on, and have spent many hours behind the wheel of this vehicle.  We have the XLE trim line including a package including a moon roof, leather interior, and a power-operated door.  The sticker price was just over 31,000.  Overall, the experience with the dealership was positive.  Even thought hardly a dime was taken off the sticker price, they offered a very generous amount for our trade in leaving us satisfied with the deal.

<b>The Driving Experience</b>
   There is no forgetting that the Sienna is a large vehicle.  Since it is based on the platform of the Toyota Camry, the Sienna rides nicely and has a smooth engine and transmission.  The car also remains quiet even at highway speeds.  On the down side, the steering is very light and communicates no road feel.  Obviously, the Sienna shouldn't be expected to handle like a sports car, but it feels somewhat top heavy when taking turns.  Wet braking is mediocre.

<b>Interior</b>
   The Sienna highlights the "mini" in minivan.  Even though it seats seven, it is difficult to actually travel with that many people aboard.  Leg room in the third row is minimal, and the middle row seats must be pushed forward to provide any room.  On the positive side, the seats are comfortable.  This vehicle is most appropriate for a family of four.  Having taken many trips in the van, an average amount of luggage can not be carried without completely removing the rear seats, dragging the seating capacity down to four.  Also, converting this van from a seven to a two seater is no easy task.  Each middle seat and the two sections in the rear seat must be removed individually.  They weight a lot and may require two people to lift them out of position and remove them from the vehicle.
   Most controls are logically laid out and easy to use.  However, in a vehicle over $30,000, automatic climate control would have been appreciated.  The rear seats receive their own air, but not radio, controls.  The major weakness is in the radio controls.  They are very low and require the driver to take his or her eyes off the road to change the channel.  However, controls mounted on the steering wheel help the situation.  On the safety front, this vehicle lacks side airbags and stability control.  However in newer models, these safety features are available.  

<b>In the long run</b>
Toyota vehicles are known for their reliability.  Racking in almost 75,000 miles on the Sienna, we haven't had many problems to report.  Initially, the steering stuck when making left turns, creating a safety hazard.  The dealer fixed this problem under warranty.  The only other problems to report include the power operated door that sometimes won't work in cold weather.  Also, the radio buttons haven't held out well, and three of the preset buttons have fallen out and are still loose.  Our Sienna has served its purpose.  We have taken many trips in it, and it has held up well overall.
