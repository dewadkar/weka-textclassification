            The 1998 Toyota Corolla has been a great little car thus far. Having just recently wrecked my 1988 Corolla that never had any problems beyond a loose fuel valve and a dying muffler, I was confident that the '98 (that I bought used) would be every bit as good and reliable as my previous Corolla. It hasn't disappointed me yet.   

PERFORMANCE & HANDLING: 

The Corolla performs well enough on city streets and the highway. It has sufficient acceleration for free on-ramps and getting out of sticky situations quickly.  And although I don't exactly take this car off-roading or on high speed thrill rides, the handling of the car is supple and it runs well at speeds in excess of 70 MPH. However, when I've got a lot of weight in the trunk or have the car filled with 4 people, I sometimes have to compensate a little when making sharp turns.  

INTERIOR:

As mentioned above, the Corolla is a tight car inside. If you've got an inseam much larger than 30" than you may feel a little cramped as the driver's seat doesn't go back too far. That said, if the seat did go back any further, the person behind the driver's seat would probably end up with bruised or crushed legs. Luckily I almost never have anyone sitting in the back seat, but if you haul human cargo around daily this may not be the car for you.  

For the most part, the controls are well placed, the climate control easy to use, and the automatic windows and doorlocks are all placed logically. Buttons, switches, etc. all feel solid and are of high quality unlike ones on many American cars in the same price range. I love the little touches like the CD storage area underneath the stereo and the sunglass holder placed within the armrest. There are also ample side pockets and a nice sized glove compartment. My ONLY complaint about the interior design (besides size) are the cup holders. If you place a cup in the holders that's even slightly less in size than the actual holder itself, the drink will easily tip on turns since there's little to keep it from falling over.  The old Corolla had a rubber lining that would hold smaller cups firmly in place. This version lacks that feature.  

Interior noise on city streets isn't too noticeable. At freeways it can get a little on the noisy side, but is at a level that allows you to hear conversations easily and the radio at relatively reasonable volume levels. 

The fold-down seats that open up to the trunk area are a nice convenience if you have skis or anything that's long and narrow that wouldn't otherwise fit. I wouldn't recommend buying ANY passenger car without this feature.

One other quirky thing about the Corolla (which I don't mind too much but others might) are the day-running headlights. They switch on automatically and there's no override switch to turn them off even if you wanted to.  The light sensor works well though to turn the headlights on at night and off when it gets lighter outside. However. it can get a little annoying when you're driving in broad day light and then go under an underpass (lights on!) and then out into broad daylight again (lights off!) within a 20 second interval.  

This car is great as a 2nd hand vehicle for students or anyone else looking for relatively inexpensive transportation that can be relied upon day after day with no headaches.
