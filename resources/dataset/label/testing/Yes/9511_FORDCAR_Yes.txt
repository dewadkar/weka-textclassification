            My sister has 95' Ford Mustang.  Unfortunalty it is not a GT model, but the 3.8L V6 that comes in it has plenty of power for that little car.  She has been very pleased with its performance and reliablity.  I like her car because it is sporty, roomy, and somewhat economical.  She gets around 25 mpg on the highway which is pretty good right now with those outrageous gas prices.  The interior of the car is nice.  She has nice bucket seats up front, an awsome factory sound system with tapedeck and CD player.  Overall the Ford mustang is a pretty good car and is very reliable.  I would recomend this car if you want a small sports car for a reasonable price.<br><br>
