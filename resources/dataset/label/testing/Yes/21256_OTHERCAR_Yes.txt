            I'll be honest.  I am too young to drive.  I probably can just barely reach the pedals.  And yet here I am,.  writing and e-pinion about the brand new 2000 Toyota Camry V6 sedan  my parents have just bought.  So if you want a general overview,  with a few subtle points made, continue reading.  If you only carte about the drive,  then choose another opinion.

The ride:  

Today we were driving on unpaved country roads.  We were also driving on the highway.  I can honestly say that I could not tell the difference between the suspension.  Yes, it WAS that good.  It has very tight 
turning,  which sometimes makes for slightly jolt-y turns at all speeds,  but this is only occasional. 

The sound:

...Quiet.  Very quiet.  You can not here the roar (or lack there-of) of the engine, nor could you here any outside noise�  In New York city the car was like a nice safe haven...Until I started blasting Bad Religion out of the incredibly nice 6-Speaker JBL sound system.  (Now STANDARD [!] on all models).  This stereo is on par with that that BMW uses in their 3-series (and possibly 5-series).  The bass is incredibly deep, the treble is indistinguishable when the bass is up, but when you lower the bass, that sounds good too.  My only complaint is the very sloppy control panel with rather small buttons, and a microscopic eject button.

The amenities:

Ouch...that is all I have to say for the heavy traveler.  Despite having a rather large trunk., There are NO compartments in the back (Including little elastic pouches in the back of the front, and , besides the glove and armrest, are VERY small (2 very skinny in the door, and 1 hard to open one to the left of the steering wheel.  But that�s just the beginning.  There is a compartment at the to for a garage door opener, that not only fell out several times while we were driving (A defect the dealership was happy to replace), but came with a practically useless glasses case, that ended up scratching my parents glasses, not protecting them.  While I'm in this complaining' mode I might as well say the all-time most annoying feature of this car: The spaz-taztic remote door opener.  It will not unlock all of the doors with a push of the &quot;Unlock&quot; button.  You have to push it 2 or 3 times for that to happen.  Sometimes the car just starts beeping when you try and lock the doors.  And of course there is the time when all of the lights start flashing on and off FOR NO REASON.  A major &quot;piss-off.&quot;  Oh yeah.  For those of you that care, it has 4 cup holders, 1 ash tray, and two 12v power sources (One of which being the cigarette lighter-holder.
