            I bought this digital camera at Circuit City because I was setting up an on-line business and needed to have some decent photos of my product.  It was one of the few affordable cameras that has both digital and optical zoom.  In laymen's terms that means better pictures and more flexibility in how close you have to be to your subject.  One of the best features of this product is the LCD screen on the back of the camera.  With this screen, you can look at what your are taking a picture of instead of having to look into just a traditional camera hole.  You can also view menu options from this screen, delete pictures, scroll through pictures, etc.  I actually take most of my pictures using the LCD screen view of the object.  Maybe it's just me, but when I take pictures the traditional way, the pictures don't seem centered quite right. Maybe the lens spectrum is just a little off, but when I use the the LCD screen to get my object in view for a shot, they come out fine.
This camera takes really nice pictures.  And what is neat is that you have the option to take 1, 2, or 3 star pictures.  1 star pictures are good quality, but lower pixels so you don't take up as much room and you can take more pictures and store them on your camera (105 pictures to be exact.) 2 star pictures are even nicer, but you can only take 15 at a time before you have to download them off your camera.  3 star pictures are top quality, but you can only take 8 at a time before you have to download them off the camera to make room for more.  Honestly, I take most of my pictures with just 1 star quality and they look great!  I have taken a few 3 star pictures and they really show a great spectrum of color and clarity.  3 star quality is great for pictures with lots of color or for pictures where you need intense detail.  And you can change the "star quality" with an easy click of a button on the top of the camera!
Also, I like the fact that when I plug the camera into my computer the HP software for "uploading" the photos automatically comes up and you can get started.  This software is also really easy to use and it comes with the camera.
A few drawbacks to this camera (and they are minor) is that the batteries don't last long at all.  This camera really sucks down the batteries in record speed.  Two recommendations if you buy this camera:  Get the rechargeable batteries and battery charger (about $30-50 for everything) AND shut off the LCD screen when you are done taking your pictures.  It will automatically shut off on it's own if you forget, but just shut it off right away.  I was told by the service tech. at Circuit City that the LCD screen is by far the biggest battery drainer.  So a word to the wise!
My only other complaint about this camera is that there is a significant delay between the time you push the button to take a picture and when the picture actually shoots.  If you are shooting an object that doesn't move, then who cares right?  Right.  But if you are trying to get a picture of your cat and dog snuggling together in a once-in-a-lifetime pose, you will probably get a picture of your cat lying there and a picture of your dog's butt as he walks away just after the picture finally "takes."  This can be quite annoying.  I have erased numerous pictures that have not come out because of this (people look away too soon thinking the shot is over or animals move, the scene is over, etc.)  My only remedy for this has been to push the button, then call my dog, or try to anticipate shots which can be tricky.  This is a bit aggravating, but shouldn't keep you from buying the camera.  I have heard most digital cameras are like this.
All in all, this camera is very user-friendly, takes really nice pictures and gives you a lot of nice options for shots like zoom and 1-3 stars.  I have had no problems with it and it was well worth the money.
