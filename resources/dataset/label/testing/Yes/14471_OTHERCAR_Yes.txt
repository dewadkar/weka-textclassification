            Over the summer, I needed a digital camera quickly. After glancing over review sites such as this one, I had a good idea of what I needed for my first camera. The problem was that I couldn't find any of the models that were highly recommended (The Fuji ones in particular) so I had to settle for a camera model that didn't receive such high marks from other users.

My first impressions with the Kodak CX4230 were pretty good. The camera has very little user settings so you can almost jump right in and start taking pictures. It is surprisingly light and feels good enough in your hands. The Easyshare software that you install on your computer does almost everything automatically and photos are transfered in a relatively quick pace.

That was 6 months ago. Now that I had the opportunity to take hundreds and hundreds of pictures with it and had time to test other cameras as well, I can add some nuances to my first impressions. 

For one thing, it is indeed slow. Most digital cameras have obvious delay problems when it comes to taking pictures, but this one is perhaps more sluggish than it should. I can take 2, 3 or even 5 seconds before the camera can snap a shot. The same goes when viewing pictures on the small LCD screen where the camera seemingly needs several seconds to load pictures to preview.

I remember seeing reviews for this camera saying there were several problems with corrupt photos. My first few months using it, I encountered no such thing. But that was until I added a new memory card where my photos started to get corrupted. I can not say for sure if the camera or the memory card is to blame, but considering other people's experiences, it seems to be the former.

While the camera was not daunting at all when I started using it, I've grown to realize that its lack of features, options and user settings were a downside. The camera could use some basic image manipulation functions such as cropping and image rotation. I think I would also like some control over JPEG compression of the photos and perhaps a way to adjust picture softness. 

Worst is the Kodak CX4230 lacks very important features that should be standard for a camera of its price. It has absolutely no movie mode at all. I didn't care when I bought it, but there's no denying the ability to capture videos can be better in some situation than static photos. The option should always be available. This model also has difficulty taking pictures in low-light environment. I take very little pictures in such conditions as a result. Greater sensitivity to ambient light or a flat-out night mode, like higher-end Kodak models, would be preferable.

And despite it all, I can not fault the Kodak CX4230 in certain areas. I've carried it in my jeans pocket for months and could take pictures in pouring rain and in the rigor of the Canadian winter. The camera looks kinda flimsy and fragile, but it is clearly not.

I've grown accustomed to its light weight to the point where it will be a definitive requirement for my next camera. I've been impressed by middle range camera models like Canon's Powershot A series in terms of user settings and picture quality, but boy, are those cameras heavy in comparison. This is not helped by the fact they require an extra pair of AA batteries where the CX4230 does not.

And as a guy who just keeps his photos on his computer and doesn't print them out, I've been more than satisfied with picture quality. I even like taking pictures at the lowest quality level (800x600). For casual photos of people and events, higher quality is overkill, IMHO. Only landscape photos with lots of details require bigger photos.

All in all, this is a decent level-entry camera. When I bought it, I didn't know much in the subject, but I've learned a lot since then. Part of the credit goes to my experience with this camera and my desire to get more of the same quality and features I've grown accustomed to.
