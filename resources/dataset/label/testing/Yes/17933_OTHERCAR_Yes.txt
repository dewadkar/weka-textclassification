            Well, we're going on year three for the Toyota Avalon and I am happy to say all is still going great!  58k miles so far and the only items to be replaced are a few light bulbs.  The new tires from Bridgestone/Firestone have made a world of difference in the ride/handling/cornering characteristics of this car.

I have never had a car so dependable and maintenance free.  The only thing we do is change the oil.  Even the brakes still have 40% life left on them and I'm a hard driver.

If you are in the market for a pre-driven car, don't pass up the Avalon.  You won't be let down.  Don't look for mine in the paper, I'm keeping it for a LONG time!
