            When you walk into the Pontiac store and you ask to see a new Trans Am, don't let them show you anything but the WS6 with the 6 speed manual. I drove the stock TA with an Automatic, and my Saab outran it.  The WS6 pakage not only changes the cosmetics, but the suspension as it has since 1976 when it debuted.  The new WS6 also has Ram Air.  Great feature to bring back memorys of Muscle cars.  This car comes darn close to the performance of the Corvette, which I own and Love.  SLP is the company that transforms the stock TA into the fire breathing 3700lbs. rocket that we have grown to love.  They do very high quality work, no ratles and all the aftermarket/factory upgrades look like they were supposed to be there from the begining.  This car is VERY fast and I don't recommend you buy if you are not looking for just that.  This car needs to be ran hard to keep everything working right.  Not too hard, just right.  If you want something that is considerably slower but still has the sporty look, try a mustang GT.  But I would be willing to bet that a V-6 Firebird would out run that Ford.  At least test drive one so you can understand the feeling of a real $28,000 sports car.  This is the way they should all run in this price range.  <br><br>
