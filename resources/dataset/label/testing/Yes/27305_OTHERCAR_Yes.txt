            After owning a dodge caravan for the running children around years, I wanted something a little smaller, but not sedan size. I was also tired of a 6 cylinder that sputtered when I went up hills. I found that with other Sport Utility Vehicles I could not get 5 adults seated comfortable and sometimes I need to transport 6 people.  I also did not want to feel like I was driving a truck or bus. I found that with the Durango I can seat 5 people comfortably on long trips and 6-7 on short trips.  I also love the ease of converting the seating space to cargo space and can carry large loads. I have had a few problems 2 to be exact and the dealership has been excellent with correcting any problems.  I do think it is has a little slower initial pickup than I would like but really does well once I am on the road.  I love the way it curves and how easy it is to park and handles. The biggest downfall is gas mileage, but this does not outweigh owning the durango and getting where I need to go in style and in a hurry. I do wish I could keep my front wheels cleaner as there is a lot of brake dust and my wheels are very hard to keep clean.  The other positive is when we do get snow in Kentucky, it handles it well even in 2 wheel drive, but I love the confidence of having a four wheel drive that rides and handles like a car instead of a truck and I love the ease of getting in and out without having a stepstool. I do wish there was a way to secure groceries in the back such as a net, but if I won the lottery tomorrow I would buy a new Dodge Durango for me and all my family members.<br><br>
