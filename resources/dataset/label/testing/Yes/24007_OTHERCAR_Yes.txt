            The Honda Accord was the first Honda that our family ever bought.  We bought it New in 1992, and we have never had to regret our decision.  The car has taken our family on many trips, and is the most reliable car we have ever owned.  We bought the car with a standard 5 speed 4 cylinder engine, and it has taken me and my family across country, up pikes peak (rigorous brake test on the way down), and just about everyone in the country.  Our car has 186,000 miles on it and it has NEVER has any significant problems.  We do keep good car of the car, with oil changes and tune-ups, so this may contribute to its great condition, but no other car we have ever owned has worked so well, and never developed problems.  

We have never had to do any major work on the car, the biggest problem we have had was the slightly weak engine with the car.  It is not weaker than any other car, but sometimes a 4 cylinder just doesn't have the torque that a V6 has.  In general though we prefer the 4 cylinder as it gets better gas mileage.  We get roughly 25 miles to the gallon, which is roughly average, 32 miles on the highway.  

Another great advantage of the Honda Accord is its HIGH resale value.  Since Hondas are such great, and reliable cars, they have a very high resale value.  Other cars have good resale value as well but Hondas are known for their excellent reliability, and resale value.  Buying our Accord was the greatest investment that me and my husband ever made.  I highly recommend that they be purchased.<br><br>
