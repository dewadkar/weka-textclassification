            Take a look at this one!  I bought a 1999 Infiniti G20t (the &quot;t&quot; stands for touring model) in June of this year.  To be honest, I cannot think of a better car for what I was looking for.  First of all, the G20 is a great-looking car.  Buy the touring model, and you have got spoiler, moonroof, fog lights, and chrome wheels all in one!  Add the usual Infiniti amenities (already included), such as 6-speaker Bose CD stereo system, auto climate control, and cruise control, and this fine machine is dressed to impress!  The leather package does cost extra but is well worth it.  The braking system and steering control are the finest that I have experienced in a medium-range sports sedan.  An extremely smooth ride that still allows you to feel the road, instead of the &quot;floating&quot; feel of a Camry or luxury sedan.  And then it feels like a racing car when I take the turns at 15 mph too high!  The engine is a modest 4C - 140 hp, and I agree it would be awesome to have another 20 to 30 hp.  However, the G20t is a well-endowed car at under $25,000.  The many safety features are also a big plus.  The only things I don't like about this car are the placement of the cup holders and the lack of a space for my loose change.  If you are looking for a sporty-looking car that is a big step up from a Civic/Accord, and a lot roomier than an Integra/Eclipse, and much cheaper that a BMW/Mercedes, you must check out the Infiniti G20t.  On the other hand, if you feel safer with a car that's more prevalent on the road (I hardly see a new G20 on the streets) or need a little more kick in your engine, the G20t is not for you.<br><br>
