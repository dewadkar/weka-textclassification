            I'm quite a big fan of convertibles and always take the chance to drive them.  The Mitsubishi Eclipse GS Spyder got about 1,000 miles over a couple of weeks, top up and top down.  Similar cars I have owned are a 1991 Eclipse GSX, 1996 BMW Z3, and 2000 Lotus Elise.  Comments about the 2002 Eclipse will bear comparison with those cars.

<b>To shift or not to shift</b>

The only 2002 Eclipse I have driven is the 2.4 automatic.  Immediately its chances of succeeding as a sports car are hurt.  The auto box, even though it is a good 4-speed with manual shift option, does not mate well with the 2.4 4 cylinder engine.  This engine has decent power, but doesn't really give its best until above 4,000 revs.  If you want the automatic then I suggest getting the 3.0 6 cylinder engine.  The automatic shifts very smoothly at some throttle/rev combinations but can get quite jerky at other times.  Manual upshifts can be a little slow, especially from 1st to 2nd.  Although you have a tiptronic-style manual shift, this is still a clutchless automatic gearbox, so don't expect much in the way of engine braking.  In fact it is usually best to leave downshifts to the electronics, especially if you want to avoid shifting down at the same time as the car decides to.  Hitting first from third can be a bit of a shock.

<b>Four cylinders or six</b>

The engine, as I mentioned before, provides its best power at higher revs, even though it is red-lined just over 6,000 revs.  It has a fairly large-bore exhaust pipe sticking out the back, but don't expect boy-racer noises.  Even when driven hard you'll get a muted buzz rather than a roar.  At times this can be irritating since the engine note tends to drone away without much reference to the way you are driving.  The six cylinder 3.0 has more power and is better suited to cruising with an automatic, but mileage suffers.

<b>Steering the boat</b>

You might be tempted to spin the large feather-light steering wheel like a ship's wheel, but at less than 3 turns lock-to-lock that won't be necessary.  The turning circle is very poor for a fairly small car and I constantly found myself failing to hit a parking slot and having to back up for another attempt.  On the move, the steering gives absolutely no feedback about what the car is doing.  The front-wheel drive setup understeers into fast corners, but will oversteer under power.  The trick is working out what it is doing without a compass.  When I did use some power oversteer, the steering was just too dull and slow to manage it properly.  The Lotus Elise is obviously superior in this respect and so is the BMW Z3.  What have Mitsubishi done to the steering since 1991?  My old Eclipse GSX had decent steering adequate for a sports car, but this 2002 model has lost it.  The roadholding is good once you are set in a smooth bend, but don't expect to slalom with confidence.

<b>Riding the waves</b>

Since the car doesn't really encourage racing, you might be entitled to some comfort as you cruise sedately along.  On the smooth roads of central Florida everything was very refined, with decent comfort from the seats and good isolation from the road (if that is good in a sports coupe).  However, hit a pothole or a patch of broken pavement and the Spyder loses its composure.  Small bumps feed through to the cabin more than they should and larger ones give the body a little shimmy.  The normal composed cornering gets upset when the road surface isn't so smooth.  All this in a new car leads me to believe that the Eclipse will be a jelly after 50,000 miles.

<b>Take a breath of fresh air</b>

To many people, everything I've written so far is irrelevant.  This is a convertible and it passes or fails on the open-top experience.  Unlatch two clips at the top of the windscreen and the top folds away at the touch of a button.  Nothing fancy, just folds into a compartment behind the rear seats, then you can cover it manually if you really want to.  It takes its time doing so compared to some cars but not so long that you'll need a coffee.  Once its down you can see behind you again.  Top up, the tiny glass rear window and overblown spoiler almost completely block the view out the back.  With the windows down its pretty breezy.  Windows up and its not too bad in the front seats, just a typical convertible draft between the seats.  Anyone in the back needs to be well tied down to resist the gale buffeting them around.  The highish waistline and sloped screen detract from the open-air feel a little.  All in all, its quite pleasant and civilised, at least in the front.

<b>Kids and luggage</b>

This sports coupe has two back seats and a trunk.  The rear legroom varies from very poor to acceptable depending on the position of the front seats.  Headroom is excellent with the roof off and way too little with it on, so the back is really for kids only.  Adults will suffer after only a few miles, if they can get in at all past the front seats and over or under the seatbelts.  The trunk is quite sizeable and would take a suitcase or two plus some extra bags.  The only drawback is the tiny opening which wouldn't accept my suitcase at all.

<b>Bits and bobs</b>

The equipment level is good, with electric everything, cruise, AC, and a good Infinity audio system.  That traction control and ABS are optional shows again that this car is not aiming to be a real sports machine.  The instruments are basic but adequate for the driver, if you consider a speedo crammed against the tach and reading to 140mph as adequate.  The unfortunate result is that all usable speeds are squeezed into the bottom left corner and tricky to decipher on the move.  The dash has a large expanse of moderate quality dark plastic and the standard cloth seats are comfortable enough for most jaunts.  I'm sure most Americans will opt for leather on a car which will probably run close to $30,000 on the road.

<b>Is it for me</b>

If you are looking for a sporty little number to be driven hard, or at least driven, then choose something else.  If you want to look like a sporty little number as you cruise down the street, this is your car.  The Eclipse Spyder is a good machine for breezing along with the wind in your hair, but it fails as a driver's machine and would be difficult to live with roof-up and transporting the family around.
