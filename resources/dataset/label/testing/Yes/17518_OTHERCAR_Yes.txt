              I have a 2003 325 convertible.  It is an absolutely amazing vehicle.  This car is a joy to "scoot" around town with, the handling is first-rate, and the ride is smooth--not at all harsh.  You could cruise all day and be comfortable.  The car is extremely nimble and maneuverable; most importantly, it is simply fun to drive. It is one of the best-balanced vehicles you can find--it has the fun factor of a Mazda Miata, but has room for four and more class.  
 
    Mine is an automatic--this transmission is probably the best auto I have ever driven.  And I've driven a few--I've owned a Jaguar XK8, a Jag XKR, a Lexus SC400, a Corvette convertible (auto), an Acura NSX and a Jaguar XJ8.  The 5 speed steptronic on this beemer  outperforms them all--its always in the perfect gear--never searching in that in-between mode that you often get with an automatic in an otherwise sporty  car.  And if you want more "sport," just slap the gearshift to the left and you're in Sport mode, which holds each gear a bit longer and is more sensitive to the input from your right foot.  If you feel the need, you can flick the gearshift forward or aft in Sport mode and manually control the gears, but this is not really necessary, as the car does quite well on its own. 
 
    My car has the premium package, which really makes the interior shine. It has just the right touch of wood to subtly suggest luxury, without overdoing it like some others.   The seats are  comfortable, although I do wish that an adjustable lumbar was standard--it would make the reasonably comfortable seats even better.   The 325  is only 184 hp, but the car handles so well that you really don't miss the extra power that would come with a bigger engine.  You won't win any stoplight starts, but you will have a lot of fun driving...anywhere.
  
   Most of the models I looked at were equipped with the optional sport package.  The one I bought did not have it.  I read somewhere that all 3 series models have a "sport" suspension, but the sport package gives you  more "sport" with slightly stiffer suspension, bigger wheels and lower-profile tires, for even better handling.  In my opinion, you don't need the sport package--the car handles great without it, and gives a smoother ride, with tires that will last much longer (treadwear of 400 on the stock 16" tires vs. only 240 on the 17" tires that come with the Sport package).  And if you want to drive so aggressively that you think you need the lower-profile tires, you should be looking at a Z4 or an M3.  This car does not need them--with the excellent suspension and balance, this car will easily outmaneuver most cars on the road--and keep a permanent grin plastered to your face.  But if you consistently drive your car hard, and don't want to spend the $$ for the M3, you should probably opt for the sport package, as it does give a noticeably firmer ride.
         
    I also have the upgraded Harmon Karden stereo---if you value good music in your car you definitely want this.  The base model stereo in the 3 series is terrible.  The Harmon Karden sounds quite good--not as good as what you get in a Jag or a  Lexus but good enough that it is more than worth the extra $675 charge.  Another extra worth the money is the heated seats, a feature any top-down afficianado will tell you is a must have.  These are far and away the best heated seats I've ever seen in any vehicle, as you feel a substantial rush of heat within seconds of turning them on. 
   
  My quibbles are few:  First, there is no lumbar adjustment--a car that costs this much should have adjustable lumbar as standard.  The 330 gets adjustable lumbar support--why not the 325?  Second, the tilt steering wheel does not tilt far enough down so that you can get a comfortable driving position with the steering wheel near your lap.  Why have it tilt at all if it only moves a couple of inches and still results in a driving position of arms near or above shoulder level?  If you ever drive a Corvette or an NSX, or even a Jag, you'll see what I'm talking about.  Those cars allow much more travel in the Steering column and thereby accomodate a wide range of preferred driving positions. And finally, the stereo controls on the steering wheel are awkward to use--you need to take your eyes off of the road to use them.  BMW got it right with the MINI steering wheel controls, as those are amazingly easy to use by feel alone.  Its too bad they didn't use the same setup on this car.
 
   Bottom line though is that this is one incredibly satisfying automobile.  Fun to drive and very classy.  I've often heard that BMW's are pricier than their competition--mine had a sticker of $42,995--but as one who has owned and driven many in this class or above, it is my opinion that this car is worth the money, and then some.
