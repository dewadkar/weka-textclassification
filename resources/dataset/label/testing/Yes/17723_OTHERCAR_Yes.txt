            I have been a Saturn customer for the past 5 years.  Above all what has convinced me to buy a Saturn again is the quality of their product for an affordable price and the wonderful service department. 
 
I recently purchased a 2000 SL2 model.  When I was researching to make my decision I looked at different cars in the price range of 15k.  I had to have a sunroof because it makes me happy to take a long drive on a beautiful day and feel the openness with the sunroof open and the windows down.  I wanted a car that would get good gas mileage because with the rising gas prices I don�t want to break the bank at every fill-up.  I also wanted an automatic transmission because with all of the traffic in the northeast I don�t want the bother of having to deal with a standard transmission.  And I wanted a cruise control because I have a tendency to speed when I take those long drives.  

I was surprised by all of the good deals out there right now because the 2001 models are coming out.  I wanted to research my purchase and make sure I was getting the best value for my dollar.  I went and looked at the Ford focus and it was too small to fit my needs.  I drove a Ford Escort and I was unimpressed with the pick up and the interior was not as lush.  I looked at the Chevy Cavalier and it was nice the pick up was good, but I was unimpressed by the interior.  When I went to the Saturn dealership I was captivated by the financing rates they were offering.  I had been on the website to see what prices I would be looking for the options I wanted.  I don�t like the whole haggling process so I was happy that I knew up front what I would be looking at price wise.  I was also surprised to find out that they were discounting the 2000 stock that were still on the lot.  

When I found my car I fell in love.   It was the dark hunter green with tan interior.  It looked luscious and it had all of the options that I was looking for and more.  The best thing is that the cruise control was not on the sticker so I got it at no extra cost.   It only had 5 miles on it when I drove it off the lot.  I took advantage of the great APR they were offering at the dealership.  I financed for 60mo @ 4.9%APR.  I have had it for a month now and love the way it handles tight turns and the suspension is much better than my �92.  The 92� that I traded in had 152,000 miles on it.  It didn't look 8 years old and was a good, reliable car.  I was happy with my previous experience with Saturn and I am positive that the good relationship will continue with my new car.  Above all the car is a wonderful value and I feel safe knowing the service department is so helpful.
