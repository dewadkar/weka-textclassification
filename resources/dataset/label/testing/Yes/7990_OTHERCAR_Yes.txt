            <i>�A Safe Box�</i>. For years the Volvo designers have wrestled with this paradox. How to capitalize on the reputation for safety and lose the rap of being box-shaped? Finally, in 1999, the designers got a spark of enlightenment and released the �new� Volvo�s.

Although it will never win any futuristic style awards, this is <i>not</i> your fathers Volvo. The styling has improved, the outward appearance has improved, the performance is outstanding and the safety is still everything you would expect from a Volvo.

I�m not going to concentrate on the technical specs of this vehicle. You can get those from the website, Edmunds or numerous car &amp; driver-type mags. I�m going to focus this review on what it is like to actually <i>drive it</i> and other practical aspects of the car.

Access to the S80 is by a dual standard/electronic key. A nice feature are the external pool lights which turn on around the car as you unlock it � triggered from the keyring. Very reassuring if you park in dark back-alleys or airport parking lots in the wee hours of the morning.

<b>The Insides</b>

The seats are what I�d call standard luxury. They tilt, recline and swivel in all the right places and provide excellent lumbar support. You can also set three positions into memory preventing those family arguments about whom left the seat where � the auto equivalent of leaving the toilet seat up. Both passenger and driver seats can be heated for those freezing cold winter mornings or to get those hot, passionate nights off to a fast start.

The dashboard is neatly laid out, without a great deal of fuss. There have been some complaints about gauge visibility, but I have never had a problem. Basic Cruise, CD and Radio controls are duplicated on the steering wheel, encouraging the driver to focus on the road ahead. <i>Remember that the most dangerous part of a car is the nut holding the wheel</i>.

Although very well appointed, you feel that the Volvo falls behind competitors like the Lexus 300 in terms of widgets and doodads in the car. The stereo, although functional, is just that (although there are several stereo upgrades available) - and Volvo S80 owners have been reporting AM radio problems for years. A few other touches like small cup holders and no place to put your sunglasses just irritate you if you are really into luxury. However, after driving the car for several months I look forward to climbing behind the wheel.

<b>The Drive</b>

Smooth and quiet. You can very quickly find yourself doing 75 mph down the highway and 40 down your local street if you don�t pay attention. There is almost no wind noise, engine noise is a gentle hummmmm, and nothing shakes or rattles. Acceleration is more than enough to get you out of trouble and the pick-up will leave most cars behind you at the light. Again, there are a few detractors because the Volvo is a tenth of a second or two slower than one of its competitors, but it�ll get you to 60 safer than any other car. As a personal comment, from a long-time SUV driver, the handling is very smooth &amp; responsive to the touch, as are the brakes.

Note: The <b>Volvo S80 T6</b> does feature a turbocharged V6 engine. The standard S80 <i>will not</i> generate the same acceleration and horsepower/torque the T6 does. 

<b>Safety</b>

Well � you have to talk about it. The Volvo is just designed with safety in mind. There are the usual two airbags in the front, plus two side mounted airbags that also extend backwards to cover the windows in the rear seats.
High impact absorbing safety zones are set a little higher than most other cars, to take account of getting whacked by a SUV or minivan, as well as handling a collision with another sedan. Other neat touches include putting the fuel tank opening on the passenger side � i.e away from the road if you�re pulled over to the side. There are also some technicalities involving the alignment of the battery and the engine � all designed to make sure that if the worst happens � it won�t happen to you, just the car.
  Urban legend has it that several policemen have been killed jimmying the side locks on the Volvo. The shimmy sets off the side airbags, which cause it to be kicked violently back, and through the neck or jaw of the cop. Beware.

<b>Overall</b>

The Volvo S80-T6 is a safe, reliable, luxury car � designed for people who want to enter that hi-BMW/mid-Mercedes &amp; Lexus market but are not willing to sacrifice too much dough for show. The safety features are a strong pull (although the Mercedes line puts in strong competition). At least you know that in the icy winter the Volvo will stay on the road, allowing you to sneer at the BMW drivers waiting for AAA to pull them out of the roadside ditches. If you are in the market for absolute pure luxury at this price range then go for the Lexus and load up on options, if you want to hedge your bets a little � check out the Volvo S80 T6.

<b>Post Sale</b>

Volvo is all over you in making sure you are happy. More than happy - delighted. They also offer a website to track your finance options and review your account.
