            Although I was smitten after my test drive experience in the Sentra SER, I still hadn't tested the new 2003 Toyota Corolla. Keep in mind, the soul purpose for me purchasing a new vehicle is for my daily commute to work and back. The Sentra was sweet as far as performance standards go, and I'll also tip my hat to the exterior fit and finish. But the interior is nowhere even close to the styling and quality as the 2003 Toyota Corolla. 

So, a week after my Sentra test drive I took a spin over to Toyota. As I walked in the main doors I immediately noticed a nice 2003 Corolla Sport (Black) sitting in the showroom. Wow. I liked what I saw. So I opened the door, sat down on the nicely upholstered seats placed my left hand on the beautiful leather steering wheel. Wow. I simply couldn't believe what a nice job Toyota has done with the re-style of the last model Corolla. Toyota would have had to pay me to drive last years model. After the salesman approached and we finished with all the price stuff it was time to take a spin. 

PERFORMANCE
We took out the LE, not my first choice but there weren't any Sport models available for test drives. Fortunately there was about two inches of snow on the road in some parts which the Corolla handled very, very well. Right away, the chassis felt firm but not 'jittery' this car was very solid and well made. The steering is excellent, very responsive and holds a straight line very well. Not to mention it's a beautiful leather wrapped steering wheel! The turning radius is handy for squeaking into tight parking spaces etc. Parallel parking is as easy as pie. Although the spoiler can make it a little tougher for those
who are 'challenged' parkers.

The Sentra SER almost chipped my teeth when I took the same test drive route. But the Sentra is a different car then the Corolla.The Corolla was very pleasant, I wouldn't say 'sporty' or 'sophisticated' just a perfect blend of the two. I have only owned this car for a few weeks, in that time have had at least 20 different people comment on how much the Corolla looks like a Lexus. Surprisingly, many of my friends who are devoted 'Yankee' car buyers had many complements for the Corolla.  The most common compliment 
was how 'beefy' is looks especially compared to the likes of Mazda Protege' or the Honda Civic. At work I park beside those two cars every day, they don't even look like their in the same class as the Corolla.

As for pure speed, you'd have to be a complete idiot to expect a 'fast corolla'. People always complain about not enough speed or 0-60mph or quarter mile times. Wake up, smell the reality... Most people that are purchasing a car like a Corolla, Civic, Sentra or a Protege aren't trying to break any speed records. These are the practically minded individuals who are aren't concerned with how pretty their car is and how fast it goes. These people are more concerned with reality, reliability, fuel economy and not living above their means by driving a car with monthly payments that is half as much as their salary. 

However there are a few cars in this segment that could satisfy some peopleï¿½s urges for speed: Z24 Cavalier, Sunfire GT or the Sentra SE-R. But the build quality and the fit and finish of the Cavalier and Sunfire would have you think they were assembled with a glue gun and duct tape. No wonder GM and Pontiac can sell so many of these junk boxes for so cheap. But then again, you get what you pay for and if you do invest in one of these cars you can almost guarantee having problems and a pathetically low resale value. 

INTERIOR
The cabin is nice and quiet, the interior makes me feel comfortable and gives me something to admire while sitting at red lights. There are many conveniently placed storage compartments through out the dash, all of them either have or will serve a functional purpose at one point in time. The center console under the drivers right arm holds FOURTEEN cd's!!!  Visibility is wonderful, I always
have a completely unobstructed view of my surroundings while driving. As for road noise, I'd have to say it's pretty good. The city I live in has several rough roads none of which produce harsh sounds inside the cabin. The double seals on the doors probably have a lot to do with the quite ride. You can try, but you will not find a car in this class that even begins to compare with the interior styling and high level of quality. If you're a minimalist, you will like the Civic or Protege; I've driven both and would have to say I was quite impressed with the Protege and less than enthusiastic about the Civic. 

The back seats in the Corolla are also quite roomy for this type of car. In this class of car you will never find tons of room in any of the back seats. Statistics show that only 5percent of the time on average you will have an adult in the back seat of a compact car. Overall everything down to the fabric on the seats is top notch. Make sure you get the sales person to pop the trunk open, it's huge for this 
class, I easily fit seven large bags of cedar mulch in the trunk on my last stop at the garden centre.

EXTERIOR
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, a few people may think the Corolla is too conservative, but I haven't run into anyone yet who has that opinion. Some people call the new Corolla a 'baby lexus', well it's in the bloodlines. But it's no Lexus. It's about as close as you could 
possibly get for a car under 20K (Canadian) without tax. Obviously I like the exterior if I bought the car. I'm thirty years old my wife is expecting in October and I certainly don't want to be confused with one of those punks driving a Honda Civic that's been lowered and has a stereo that's worth more than the car itself. I just wanted something that was kind of sporty, kind of conservative, economical and safe. This car has been assembled very well, all the exterior panel gaps are tight and consistent widths throughout the entire car. I personally like the Sport model (that I own) because it makes the car look thicker and more substantial. But the more LE models I see around town the more I like them too, especially with the leather, very sweet. The front headlights are beautiful and the tail lights match the same look and feel. The grill has tasteful chrome accents that give it a far more expensive look with titanium coloured bars behind.

OVERALL
If you are looking for a practical, pleasantly styled, economical set of wheels this car is for you. I only have about 2,000 km on my odometer so far but I am nothing less than thrilled with the overall performance and quality of the Corolla Sport. Do yourself a favour and take one 
for a test drive.
