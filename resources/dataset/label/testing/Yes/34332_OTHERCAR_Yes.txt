            I've never been one to buy a used car. My first car just out of high school was used and I vowed at that point, come hell or high water, I would never own another used car in my life (hah!) Considering that was a 1986 Ford Tempo, I didn't give the used car market much of a chance. Afte that old Tempo, I owned (new) a Hyundai Accent (also written a review on this a while back...) and a Ford Aspire (ahem... not even worth reviewing), and a Saturn SL1 (which is leased).

Enough of my car history now. In our lease of the Saturn, our mileage was getting up there, and with 10 months still left on the lease, we only had 7000 miles left. It was time to get another car, larger than the saturn to accommodate our family, without the price tag of a mid-sized vehicle. Tough task...but we did it.

My husband's uncle vowed up and down that this was the best car on his lot and that he would not sell us junk, and so far, the car has made him an honest man... lol.  At the time of purchase in July 2002, this 2000 Buick had 98000 miles on it. The previous owner was a salesperson and spent most of her time on the road.

Now, at 109,000 miles, this car is still purring. It is smooth to accelerate, easy to start on a cold winter morning, and an absolute joy to drive.

Mind you, the body style of the Buick Century is nothing to brag about. Its basic, and not much more exciting than a Ford Taurus, but the comfort in the drive and the overall reliability and safety of this vehicle make up for its plain-jane body style. Besides, if you are out to impress anyone, I don't think you would be looking at Buicks anyway!

Coming from a long history of teeny tiny cars, ranging from a step up from a tin can to the Saturn, the trunk space in this car is Enormous!  I know there are larger trunks out there, but I do feel the cargo space is sufficient for a family of 3 or 4.  To give an idea of the space available, I can fit a full-size stroller, a protable high chair, and about 15 bags of groceries into it and still manage to get the trunk shut without having to sit on it! Thats enough space for me.

There is plenty of head, foot, and elbow room in the front driver and passenger seats, and although the headroom diminishes slightly in the back seat, it will still comfortably seat 3 adults about 5'10". Leg room is ample in the  back as well... just be careful getting in that you dont bump the side of your head on the support frame of the door - it can hurt!

While I am talking about the interior... let me talk about the seats. Again, I am used to economy, so driving this car to me, is  like driving a COUCH with a steering wheel. You sit down and the seats just suck you in! (Makes for very comfortable napping on long road trips)


As far as power features are concerned, most are easily accessible and easy to use. The windshield wipers took me a few minutes to figure out in a rainstorm, but we got it all under control!

If you have a choice of features on this vehicle, be certain you have traction control. I don't know how I would manage without it now, especially in these NY winters.  ABS, although not my favorit thing in the world, are also a nice standard feature.

There are just a couple drawbacks of all the power gadgets on this car: programming the power locks and power headlights. It takes just shy of a rocket scientist to figure out how to program the vehicle so that it doesn't lock automatically when the doors shut (I managed to figure it out, but it took me over an hour). AND, programming the headlights are another story in and of themselves - and a task I have yet to tackle due to the lack of time and patience.  

This car has the option of light-sensitive, time delayed headlamps, which will automatically light up when it is dark or raining, and when you shut the car off, the lights will stay on for 90 seconds after the doors shut.  I hate this. So many people tell me "Your headlights are on..." then I have to proceed to tell them that basically I am a moron that cannot figure out how to program them... lol...

All in all, if you are considering purchasing a Buick Century, I would highly recommend it, under 2 circumstances:  make sure you can see the maintenance history of the vehicle (as I was fortunate enough to see) and be sure to check out the Consumer Reports website (www.consumerreports.org) and the National Highway Transportation (www.nhtsa.org) for vehicle safety and reliability information. Had the Century not had good reports on both sides, we would never have bought it.

Best of luck in your endeavor!!
