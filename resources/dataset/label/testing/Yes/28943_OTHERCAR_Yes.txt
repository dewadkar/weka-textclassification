            <b>History</b>

This car was my parent's car, not mine, but I have acquired it as a "first car." I have been with the car for about a year. I am a commuter (at press time) and drive for an hour almost every day so I have had a hefty amount of experience behind the wheel. I have had this car for a little over a year now.

This model is manual (stick shift) and in station wagon shape.

<b>Comfort</b>

The seats are nice and comfortable, but it cannot be moved up and down for short people. I have to put a seat pad to help me see better, because I am relatively short (5' 6"). The seats have a slight bucket shape to help you stay in your seat when turning hard.

The engine is not too noisy for every day driving at low RPMs (Revolutions Per Minute). The exhaust hums along with ease as well.

<b>Interior</b>

The inside is a little bland (it's an 80s car). Nothing "eye catching." The speedometer and other displays are in an drab orange color. Easy to understand all the functions without the need for an instruction manual. 

The speakers were OK at best. I'm a teen, however, and I like excellent sound (not to be confused with LOUD sound). The front speakers blew about 2 years ago and have been replaced. The rear speakers are still working with decent bass. 

The stick shift is comfortable to hold, yet a little tough to shift. It requires more effort than newer cars and I have been having a problem lately with the stick shift not wanting to shift into first at some times. Imagine in front of a red light and when it turns green, my car's transaxle refuses to shift into first! I put the car in neutral while waiting for a traffic light.

The glove box gives ample room, but the handle barely locks the glove compartment now.

The car has been electrical problems with some lights not working and the buzzer (to warn of open doors, lights left on, etc.) sometimes works. It might be a blown fuse.

The switch for the fan speed 1 and 2 does not work anymore, but speeds 3 and 4 are fine. The engine takes a while (15 minutes) to heat up the heater in very cold weather. The AC takes about 5 minutes to cool and still works fine with infrequent "charging" needed. Many positions are available for the air to come from (Vent, Head, Feet, Combinations). After many years, the fan on my car makes a lot of noise when starting up and for the first 5 minutes. It sounds as if it need a little grease around moving parts.

The pedals still work fine. The brake pedal requires more force than newer cars. The only problem is that the spring for the clutch squeaks when pressed down.

The hand brake had some issues in the past, but it currently suffices.

I have a 5 speed manual and the car did not come with a tachometer. I shift with the help of the sound of the engine and it's vibration to know when to shift.

<b>Handling</b>

When on a new set of tires, the car can handle gracefully without loosing traction. The roll bar is a little soft, as is the suspension overall.

Power steering is unavailable in this particular model, but for me it comes naturally to turn the wheel after many hours of practice.

For quick reactions to avoid accidents, a heft effort is required.

<b>Power, Engine</b>

This car leaves much desired if your looking for a sports car. This car is pretty slow, but since I have a 5 speed; I can still keep up. The power is good enough to drive safely. However, the car seems like it was designed to be going 55 mph, because at 55 and above, on the highway, the engine is at a high RPM and the drone of the engine can get annoying at times.

When I idle the engine idles at a low RPM and the steering wheel vibrates.

Amazingly, the clutch on my car has never been replaced and clutch "grabs" each gear with strength.

<b>Reliability</b>

After 16 years, some things don't work, but it is part of age and this is normal. For 16 years, many people are surprised this car still runs and I give credit to Mazda for providing a long lasting car.
