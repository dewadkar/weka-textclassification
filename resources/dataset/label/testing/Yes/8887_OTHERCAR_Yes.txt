               The Eclipse GSX is a dream come true for any sports car fanatic, especially if, like myself you're not well off enough to go buy a $80,000 BMW M5.  It is quite a looker and does get its share of glances as I drive through town.  It's very smooth and grips the road like the two are connected.  I love the all-wheel drive system on it, as it provides a sure grip and handling of the road.  The 225 hp 4-cylinder/turbo under the hood keeps you tied to your seat.  
   Now you may say, &quot;I'm a family person and there's no way I could transport my family in a sports car&quot;.  The Eclipse GSX provides: all-wheel drive, dual airbags, side impact beams, front/rear crumple zones, just to name a few of the safety features.  Well, I'll give you this, it is rather small inside and I wouldn't recommend this car for more than 2 adults and two kids in the back, but my wife, myself and our daughter in the car-seat love the feel of the power/ride of the vehicle.  
  In conclusion, I would have to say the Eclipse GSX Turbo is very fitting to it's name/style.  There are very few cars out there, within this price range that can even come close to matching the power and smoothness of the Eclipse GSX.  I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a sporty ride/muscle car.  <br><br>
