            I had always been intrigued with the Saturn commercials.  I hate car shopping or more directly, I hate negotiating.  Overall, the car buying experience was positive, though don't look at it through rose-colored glasses.  They are still car salesman and will make sure that the deal tips in their favor.  While the price of the Saturn isn�t negotiated, your trade-in value, financing and any upgrades are.  Be careful here, you can still get taken to the cleaner.

I would recommend not trading in your vehicle and securing your own financing.  That way you�re dealing with their rock bottom price and no ability to boost their profit in other areas.  Also, don�t be tempted to upgrade the stereo with something purchased through the dealership.  You will save some serious money by driving straight to a discount audio store like Car Toys.

The other area that the dealer can pad the price is the extended warranty.  I used to feel that these were for chumps.  However, after talking to a few professional mechanics, they feel that this is money well spent (they have no connection to any dealership).  I did have the transmission throw a flange through the housing and the 2,400 repair was covered under the extended warranty (along with the towing).

Overall, I do like the car when I�m by myself and it�s summer.  My biggest complain is the lack of room behind the drivers seat.  It is difficult to get the seatbelt in and there isn�t a positive feedback click to tell you when you finally get it.  The difficulty may be associated with the center console crowding it.  I would recommend not getting the center console; it doesn�t hold CD�s and is really only good for an armrest and change holder.

For the most part, the dash, radio and climate control are laid out well.  That is until you try to put a large drink one of the two cup holders.  This almost completely blocks access to the temp and the heat/defrost control.  That sized cup won�t fit in between the heater controls and the gearshift when in park.  The gearshift will push against the cup enough to pop loose the drink lid.  And God help you if you have your hand in the natural position when moving to park � you fingers will get jammed.  

In cooler weather (most of the year in the Pacific NW), the defroster is not adequate.

It doesn�t have the get up and go that I would like, but a little manual downshifting generally compensates for that.  Gas mileage seems to be okay, but the small gas tank means filling up every other day.

Everything else has been reliable.  Doors seal, power window tracks don�t break (like other cars I�ve had), engine performs without fail.  

The car handles very well.  The ABS and traction make it an absolutely wonderful snow car.  While I might buy another Saturn, it will definitely have to have more room.  I had the pleasure of driving a Buick Regal while the Saturn was in for some accident bodywork.  The roominess, acceleration, attention to creature comforts and flawlessly smooth ride will make me think twice unless the new SL is significantly improved.
