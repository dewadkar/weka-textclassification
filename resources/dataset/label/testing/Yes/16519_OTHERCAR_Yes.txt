            After reading all the reviews of the VW Jetta, I am happy to provide a positive and honest review of a car I have enjoyed owning for almost four yrs and 60k. The Jetta Trek is a limited edition model with a few extra features added to set it apart from the GL.

 To those who have written about &quot;plastic pieces falling off&quot; I can only say that the storage trays at the bottom of each front seat are an added minor convenience and unless you rip them from the seat they hold up fine. I did experience the drivers plastic piece loosen and was quickly fixed with a screwdriver, hardly qualifying as &quot;flying off&quot;. This is one great car: good mileage, the best in its class I have read, good acceleration with the 2.0 4cyl. with manual five speed.

 The car drives well, handles great, connects you to the road unlike any other car I have owned, and has a personality which causes VW owners to nod to each other like you are getting a pat on the back.

 With all the bland transportation out there in this price range, the Jetta is a true drivers car. My service experience has been positive, no problems since the day I bought the car. I have found the Jetta reliable, built with quality, no notice of any squeaks or rattles and the only car, seriously, that I can sit in, drive six hours straight, get out and stretch and not feel drained or tired.

 If there is a downside as some suggest, I simply can't confirm any, period!!

 With 70k on my Jetta I thought I would write a quick update , especially after reading some very negative views about this vehicle. I would only add that I drive my car fairly hard in heavy traffic and after what I believe to be a good number of miles to date, this car is absolutely QUIET, no rattles, no annoying sounds or parts coming loose as has been mentioned. I don't know what &quot;drives like a box&quot; means, but for those who have described the VW like this, I would suggest a nice bland cookie-cutter sedan like a Corolla or Civic. VW's like to be driven, they connect to the road and give back excellent response for the money spent on these cars, definetly not the ride and handling everyone is looking for so a good test drive is a great idea. I do confirm that VW was careless for not including a trunk light, it is a real pain at night. If anyone is interested in knowing more about my experiences please feel free to e-mail me. The new VW's look great and I would love to buy one someday, that is, after mine is broken in!! Happy Motoring. Skip<br><br>
