            I am the mother of two small boys.  I love to take pictures, and I can easily go thru a roll a week.  This camera is the answer to my prayers!  Now I can snap away for free--- I can keep the photos that I love and delete the ones that stink.  I find this camera easy to use. The instruction manual is great. One of my favorite features is how the lens has a built in slide open cover.  I bought re-chargeable batteries and very rarely have to charge them (maybe once a month).  For a first time digital camera-- I rate this #1. <br><br>
