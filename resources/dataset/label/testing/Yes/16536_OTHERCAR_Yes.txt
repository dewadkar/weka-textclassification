            I purchased a 1996 Jetta GL 5-speed as it was coming off of a two year lease in 1998.  This car is totally fun to drive, has incredibly tight handling, and looks as great as the day I bought it at 4 years old--No squeaks or creaks like the American cars I've owned in the past have had at this age.  

I put 25,000 miles on it the first year I had it, then moved to Boston, so I don't get to drive it that much anymore (with public transport and all.)  But when I do take it on the road it never lets me down.  

The only annoyance I have to report is one that several other reviewers have also experienced: the drivers-side rubber molding strip doesn't like to stay on.  I've had to glue it on twice, but it's not really an issue considering all the positives.

The stereo sounds great, and the dashboard layout is clean and simple.  The trunk is more than ample, and comes in handy when I make my semi-annual pilgrimage to IKEA in NJ.  (That's a 4 hour drive each way from Boston!) 

I've also heard good things about the 2000 Jetta from a friend.<br><br>
