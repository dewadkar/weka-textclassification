            My mother bought her Toyota Tercel in 1991 -- four doors, DX model, cloth seats, no A/C.  She drove it for over ten worry-free years, took care of it scrupulously, and then gave it to lucky old me (she decided to buy another Toyota -- the markedly more luxurious 2000 Corolla).

I love my Tercel because it's so reliable.  I've owned a number of other compact cars (Chevette, Civic, a dreadful little Mazda), and have had nightmares of trouble with them, so the fact that I can count on my little Tercel is terribly important to me.  It's not the peppiest car I've ever driven, but it's perfectly handleable and, with a five speed manual transmission, quite pleasurable to drive.

Up until six months ago I (and my mother before me) used the Tercel for city driving in Toronto, for which is it ideal. In August, however, my husband and I moved to Nova Scotia, and we drove out there, a distance of almost 2000 km, in the Tercel.  It was not a notably comfortable journey -- this car is really not made for long road trips -- but she got us there safely, without any worries at all.  Not bad for an 11 year old car!

There are now over 130,000 km on the odometer, and she shows little sign of slowing down.  We use her for frequent drives to Halifax (about 100 km away) and she seems to thrive on the work.

What would I change?  I'd make the car roomier in the back -- it's very cramped back there, even in the four door model.  I wish my Mum had chosen the A/C option back in 1991 (she regretted that, too, within a year of buying the car ...)  A tachometer would be nice, but if one pays attention to the sound and feel of the engine, it's not too hard to work things out.    

A friend of mine has a 1988 Tercel (the hatchback kind) which he bought new and is still going strong for him as he barrels towards the 200k km mark.  I have every faith that my beloved Tercel, with careful maintenance, will do as well for me.
