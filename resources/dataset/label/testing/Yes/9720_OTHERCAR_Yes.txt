            The Rivera definitely turned some heads when it was redesigned. Either you loved the looks or you hated it. Its long aerodynamic body with the available alloy wheels, and dual exhaust gave indications that this car was not your grandfather's Buick. The luxurious leather interior is comfortable, and the moon roof is a nice touch. The car could only seat four adults. The Buick's 3800 series V6 is a very reliable powerplant, and with the Supercharger, this car is pretty quick on the highway. Handling could have been better though. The radio was constantly going on the fritz, due the anti-theft component in it malfunctioning.
The tilt wheel broke and need the retaining pin replaced.
The rear tail-lights would often burn out bulbs, and the entire 4 foot tail light section would need to be removed from the trunk area in order to change the bulbs.
