              I bought a used '97 Grand Prix, SE, 3.8,  in the spring of '99.  I came away from the dealership with a sporty, yet sensible, car for a very good price! ($12,000)  I am very impressed with the appearance, and mechanics of this car.  It has plenty of power, it handles well and is one of the most comfortable cars that I have driven in a long while. 
  I have had to have some minor work done on it though.  At 32,000 miles the linkage in my wipers went, during a rainstorm of course.  At 55,000 miles I had to replace the water pump and my fuel pump is beginning to get loud.
  I would recommend this car to anyone.  It is sporty enough for the single person and roomy enough to allow 3 large car seats in the back seat.
  Overall, this is the best car that I have ever owned.
