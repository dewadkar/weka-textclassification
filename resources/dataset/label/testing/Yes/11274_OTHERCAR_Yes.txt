            I just bought a 2000 Forester after pining for a Rav4 for more than a year. Why? It rated better, test drove better and looked just as good. With plenty of passenger and cargo room, it offers plenty of space for a small SUV. Low to the ground, it drives, and best of all, parks, like a car.

The first few things I noticed about my Forester were its incredible turn radius and its surprising pick up. I can spin on a dime, and accelerate to 80 without leaning forward! Unusual for an SUV. 

The &quot;S&quot; comes with heated seats (perfect for the mountain area I live in)and heavy-duty tires. I highly recommend this vehicle for the rural, suburban or urban dweller   

The drawbacks? I bought the optional center arm rest. This added feature cost me the passenger cup holder. Annoying to say the least.    <br><br>
