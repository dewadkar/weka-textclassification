                I got my 1990 Geo Prizm 3 years ago, at the beginning of my college career.  I had wrecked my previous car, and this was my replacement.  It was very well priced (only 3000 dollars) and had one of my favorite options, a sunroof. 
    I must say, that after driving it for three years, and almost 50,000 miles, the Prizm has not given me hardly any trouble.  It has a GREAT ride, in fact, many of my friends who ride in the car for the first time often comment on how smooth the ride is.  I certainly like how it drives.  It has a somewhat sport suspension, you can really feel the response of the steering wheel and gas pedal, unlike my old car, which felt kind of wallowy on the road.  It gets phenomenal gas mileage, almost 30 highway, and 26 city, which is great considering it is 10 years old.  The only thing I have had to replace on it were the timing belts and the battery, but this is normal car maintenance.
   The interior is very well thought out, though I wish that the radio (which is positioned low) was where the air conditioning system was, and they do this in later model years.  Even the sunroof, which is often a source of problems as the years go by, still runs smoothly and doesn't leak at all.  There is ample room in the front seats, however, consider the back seats more of a large shelf.  They don't have much leg room in them at all, and don't even CONSIDER putting someone in the middle of the backseat, unless you really dislike them! The trunk has adequate room.  
     So in conclusion, I would recommend a Geo Prizm to any of my friends, for some reason the Geo nameplate has a stigma against it, but most people don't know that while the interior is mainly Chevy brand materials, the engine of the car is from a Toyota Corolla, which is an engine known to last forever.  I have found it to be true in my case. Anyway, dealers usually sell Geos at lower prices than Toyota Corollas because of this, take advantage of this and enjoy!<br><br>
