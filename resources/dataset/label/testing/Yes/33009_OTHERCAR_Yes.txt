            I've owned several full size GM pickup trucks. My favorite had been my 1996 stepside with a 350 v8 and the sport package. That was a great looking bright red truck.  So after seeing pictures of the new GM trucks (Sierra &amp; Chevy Silverado) I decided to look at one.  Result:  I bought the one I test drove.

Perhaps the best way to evaluate the new Sierra is to compare it to the old one.  The first thing you will notice is the styling. It's not radical like Dodge or Ford - it's subtle but very different when the old and new are next to each other.  Personally I think the GMC Sierra looks better than the Silverado.  Trust me, the styling does grow on you - you'll appreciate it's rugged good looks and the fact it doesn't look like a toy truck (like so many do).

The mechanicals are where the truck excels.  The new 5.3 liter V8 is amazing.  Smaller than the 350 this engine has awesome power and torque.  Not the most important issue but this truck is fast!  With the 5.3 it's faster than the Tundra, F150, and Dodge.  The brakes are ~excellent~, you'll really like the huge 4 wheel disc/abs system.  The truck feels solid, the transmission is smooth yet quick, the ride is quiet, firm but not harsh, and interior is HUGE!  I got the extended cab and four adults really can ride around in this truck!

Of less importance:  the stereo is good, paint quality good, ergonomics excellent, handling good, and fit &amp; finish excellent.

This is the best truck GM has ever made.  Don't let the conservative styling stop you from seriously considering this vehicle.<br><br>
