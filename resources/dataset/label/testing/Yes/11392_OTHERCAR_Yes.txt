            In life we are fortunate enough to meet people who have strong impact in our lives. When I started writing for Epinions there were many people who offered constructive criticism and their friendship.  I was inspired to host a write off called Epinions Helping Hands last November. I invited numerous people to join in this write off to raise money for those in the world who are less fortunate. 

It was through this write off I met a gentlemen by the name of Mike, Epinions id Roadiem.  I had read his reviews for months and I was very pleased when he asked to participate in the write off. I knew his contribution would be excellent. I expected a car review because that is his area of expertise but was enchanted with his contribution. He wrote about the NWT bible. 

We began conversing through email and continued to do so until about four weeks before he passed away. My wife had been trying to locate a particular book in audio format and after months with no success Mike jumped in and gave us a hand. He was able to order the book through a place close to his home. It is not often that a person you have never met will come to your aid the way Mike did. 

A few weeks ago when I learned of his passing, I was stunned.  I felt as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to my stomach and then began to wonder whether or not I had returned his last email. I am sure I did but it nagged at me for days. I felt that I wanted to do something for Mike�s family but was not sure how to go about helping them. I then learned of a write off that was being hosted by Wolfman309 in Mike�s memory. 

I have decided that all proceeds that I make from here on out at Epinions will be given to Mike�s family. I will cash out once a month and send them the money. I hope that through all those people that Mike helped as he cruised down the highway of life, his family will find comfort and peace.

In Mike�s Honor � I Was An Apt Student, I Hope!

2000 Toyota 4Runner

I purchased this SUV in May of last year. If I would have known how high gas prices were going to go I might not have done so. I spend about $250.00 a month for gas alone. SUV�s are not known for their great gas mileage and mine is no exception. I get about 17 miles a gallon in the city and 20 on the highway.

Interior

My 4Runner has three different shades of gray on the interior. The seats, fabric, are two-tone with the top portion of the seat being a really light gray and a medium gray on the underside of the seats. The carpet and the rest of the interior are a darker shade of gray. The cup holders are black and control buttons. I chose the fabric interior because I have two sons that would destroy the leather that was offered for an additional price of course. 

There is a driver side air bag as well as one for the passenger. The passenger side air bag can be turned off when children are seated up front but I do not allow the boys up front for safety reasons. The driver side control panel has buttons to control all the windows and locks, while the passenger control panels can only control the door they are on. In the front seat there is a console with two cup holders, an ashtray or as I call it a change tray, and a compartment for miscellaneous items. This is where I store CD�s, cassettes. 

Overhead there is a compartment for securing a garage door opener and two visors. The driver side visor has a folder type area to secure insurance paper work and such. The passenger side visor has a mirror. There is glove compartment, and storage areas on each door. It came with a CD player, AM/FM radio, and a cassette player. One of the features that I really like is the display on the dashboard that alerts me when someone is not wearing their seatbelt. 

The storage area in the back is a pretty good size. I store all of the boys baseball equipment in bags, a large cooler, two chairs, video equipment, and any other thing my wife feels wee need to leave the house in the back. The seats fold down to make for a larger storage area and we were able to get to recliners in the back of it to move for a friend of ours.

The front has two buckets seats, with adjustable headrests while the back has a bench seat. The bench seat can hold three people and has adjustable headrests for two of them. Typically the middle seat in the back is uncomfortable because of the hump, but I have sat in the back and did not find this problem and no one has complained of it being uncomfortable, yet. Of course no one of five feet has sat in t hat spot for any length of time.

Exterior

My 4Runner is black and chrome. The windows are tinted, all except the front windows. It is about 23 inches off the ground. The rear window has a wiper on it and also has the little sprayer attachment to keep it clean. There are rear view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. I am having a memory lapse right now but I cannot remember the amount of weight I can tow but I do have the towing package on it.

You can get a luggage rack or ski rack mounted on the top of the 4Runner but I chose not to do so. I do not travel by car and I do not like to ski so I did not feel the extra money would be worthwhile. Another option available is the runner-boards. These are on both sides of the SUV to assist in getting in and out of the vehicle.

Performance

Overall this SUV rides really smooth.  I have owned trucks, cars, and now the 4Runner and it has the least amount of discomfort when hitting bumps and such. It turns corners very nicely, which is a big relief because I have heard so much about how SUV�s tend to roll over when taking sharp turns. 

I have noticed that it is not the quietest ride I have ever had but since the stereo system is pretty good I do not mind the noise so much. I have heard that the automatics are quieter but I prefer stick shift and if this is one of the downfalls I am willing to live with it.

One of the major benefits I have found owning an SUV is how high you sit up. I am able to look over the cars in front of me so I can respond quicker if there is something going on ahead. I never had this ability with a car. Plus, psychologically I feel safer being so high up.
 
I was recently involved in an accident with a guardrail. I hit a wet patch when I was exiting the highway. The front grill prevented the entire front end from being annihilated but there was still some pretty hefty damage. All in all it came close to $4,000.00 for the repairs. I have not had any problems with it since the repairs were done.

I have always owned Toyota�s and in my opinion they are one of the best cars made. If you maintain them properly and on time they perform better than the energizer bunny. 

At this time I would like to say a special thank you to Wolfman309 for organizing this write off in Roadiem�s memory. He alerted us to Mike�s passing and has devoted much time in his effort to provide some relief for his family.
