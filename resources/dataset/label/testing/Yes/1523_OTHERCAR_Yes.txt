            I got a '96 based on price. It's a great car, but it has a fatal flaw. They advertise that it is built for Canadian winters, and it does OK, so long as you don't spin the front wheels. It seems the differential has a shear pin (worth about a dollar) that shifts when you spin the wheels. Later, when you�re cruising down the hiway, it comes loose, cracks the casing, and bounces around in side the trans-axle. In all, this $1 part cost me $2600 (Canadian) in damages and towing.

When I did take it in, I found it rather suspicious that the dealer knew exactly what was wrong without even looking at it. Is this a common defect? I�d love to know. If you have any info, please email me:  saturnproblems@cyberweb.ca.
