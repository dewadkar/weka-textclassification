            For my graduation present this year, my Mom decided to get me a digital camera.  We set out knowing nothing, with the intention of making a purchase before the day was through.  We wanted to make it a one-stop purchase.  After trying out several cameras, both stills and motion cameras, we decided on the Sony.  It was lightweight, simple, sturdy, and compact.  We also purchased a "starter kit" which included a case, a lithium battery and an extra 8MB memory stick.  The problem was that the lithium battery was for a different model.  I ended up returning the starter kit, and just splurging on a battery (which is necessary since the camera can burn through AA batteries in a matter of minutes)and a separate camera bag.  I decided to wait on the memory stick.  Big mistake.  As it turns out, with an 8MB memory stick, you can cram on about six pictures. So now I need to buy a larger memory stick, and as it turns out I also needed an AC adapter to charge the battery.  This was expected, but what was not expected was the fact that they don't sell the adapter for this model in stores... only through Sony.  

After all was said and done, I have been using my camera for a couple of weeks now.  It takes really good pictures, but you need to use the LCD screen to frame them properly (this uses up the battery quickly).  If you try to use the camera's normal view finder you quickly learn that it gives an untrue representation of the picture you will be taking.  Also, because the viewfinder is in the center of the camera, and the lens is on the side, it's very easy to get your fingers or hand in the frame without realizing it.

Overall a very good camera, but be sure to get all the proper accessories, and use the LCD screen to view your pics.
