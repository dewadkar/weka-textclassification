            It was only 1 1/2 months ago, yet the memory is vivid.  I had just signed the papers  and paid the deposit for my new car, yet my heart felt melancholy.  My 1988 Corolla had gotten me through so much for the 5 years I had it, that it was as if it had become a member of my family.  However, it was time for me to move on.

I had decided to purchase a new vehicle for a few specific reasons:  1)  I had recently gotten engaged, and once I will be married I will be commuting approx. 2 hours a day.  I felt I needed a safer car than a 1988 (i.e., one with airbags and side impact beams), a more comfortable car (where by 2 hours would pass without leaving remnants via a back ache), and a more reliable car (that would get me through the sleet and the snow).  2)  A car which could be use to transport children comfortably, some day. My fiance will certainly not be having children pronto, but I figured that if I was going to spend the hard earned money on a car, I would do so with the next several years in mind.  Cars depreciate rapidly, and I do not want to have to keep getting new ones.

As with anything that costs a substantial amount of money.  I did a thorough investigation before making a decision.  Let me take you through my fail proof process.  Because of this process, I am now worry free and thrilled with my 97 Camry.

RELIABILITY

I had virtually made up my mind from the get go to buy a used car.  As I stated, cars depreciate rapidly.  I didn't want to put a fortune into a vehicle, only for it to lose thousands of its value the moment I drove it off the lot.  So, I decided to buy the Consumer Reports Guide to Used Cars.  From the reliability stand point..I narrowed my future car down to :  a Toyota corolla or Camry (both CSR best buys), a Honda Accord or Civic (best buys), and Volkswagon Jettas and Passats (not best buys but more reliable than many).

SAFETY

As I mentioned earlier, this was a biggie.  It seems that with each passing year, there are more lunatics on the road.  Since I will be driving more each day, the probability of me eventually getting in an accident is increased.  If I am so misfortunate, I want to ideally  walk away.  So...I checked out crash test results.  

I went into Yahoo, and entered automobile crash tests.  I eventually reached the National Highway safety page which has crash test results from a number of angles.  I looked up MANY vehicles: Toyotas (Corollas and Camrys from 96 to 00), Nissan Pathfinders (96 to 00), Volkswagen Jettas and Passats (96 to 00), and Honda Civics and Accords (96 to 00).  The Toyota Camrys (97 and newer) had some of the best crash test results.  The 97 was not as high as the 98 and newer Volkswagons, or the 98 and newer Accords, but it was better than anything for those cars that was built before it.  To give an approximation of where the Camry fell at this site, it would have been roughly in the 80th percentile for the cars I looked at.  This is pretty darn good.

From the National site, I was able to find a link to another crash test site- one conducted by insurance companies using slanted angles instead of simply head on and side impact.  Once again, the Camry (97 and newer) ranked very high.  This was attributed to the side impact beams, dual front airbags, and weight.  There were still some other cars in contention...The Jetta, The Corolla, and the Accord.  So, I took this list as my second criteria, so that I would now begin to focus on comfort.  I had already eliminated the Volkswagon Jettas and Passats prior to 98, for their crash test results were not great.

COMFORT

Ah, the test drives.  Fun, yet nerve-wracking none the less.  First, I drove the Jetta (a 00).  It was an average to poor drive because a) the visibility out of the rear window was poor, b) the room from virtually any seat was comparable to the car I had already- a Corolla, and I was trying to get a more comfortable car, and c) A little awkward to drive...I felt that it was a bit jerky, but that could also be because I wasn't use to it.  Next, I drove the Corolla.  This was actually much easier to drive than the Jetta, with better visibility.  However, space was an issue.  Finally, I drove the Corolla.  Ah, sweet paradise.  Have you ever felt like you were driving a living room?  That's just about how comfortable I felt.  The seat was the most comfortable, the room the best, and the ride the smoothest. 

Now, let's recap the results so far:

RELIABILITY:  1)  Camry or Accord  2)  Corolla or Civic  3)  Volkswagon Passat  4)  Volkswagon Jetta

SAFETY:  1)  Passat or Jetta (newer models) 2) Camry or Accord  3)  Corolla or Civic

COMFORT:  1) Camry  2)  Corolla  3)  Jetta (I excuded Accords and Passats due to their cost at this point.  I also excluded the Civic due to its small size)

COST:  Given that I am getting married in less than a year, I did not want to put myself in the poor house.  So, cost was important.  This is how the costs ranked from the cheapest to the most expensive:

1)  Used Corolla (97)
2)  Camry (97)
3)  New Corolla (Loaded)
4)  Used Jetta (98)
5)  New Jetta or New Camry (99s being counted here too)

At this point I excluded the Jetta.  Their reliability, comfort, and price could all be beaten by those great Toyotas.

So, here's what I did.  I called up this great dealer near me (where they don't haggle prices and are really accomodating).  I said:  &quot;Please let me know when you get a 97 or newer Camry in that is a dark color...preferably black...Here's my number.&quot;  Well, the next day (a Saturday that I remember well), I got the call about my new baby.  A 97 black Camry had arrived.  It had 30K miles, was an LE, had a 10 disc cd changer, etc.  Halleluya!!!  After it was put through the rigorous process to Certify it, and after I test drove it, I bought it.  It cost me $15K.  All I can say is what a deal!  It was this cheap because, 1)  That was a great dealer, 2)  Toyotas are always very reasonable priced, and 3)  Since it was a 97 I saved a lot on depreciation.  

It is now 1 1/2 months later, and I love it more with each passing day.   Getting in my car and driving down the open (or even high-traveled) road is a real pleasure.  I can smile with confidence, for I made a very educated decision, and I can enjoy my new vehicle with a light heart.  Follow this advice...if you need a new car, do the research.  Although, I would bet you that if you are looking for what I was looking for, it will bring you to the same conclusion...a great 97 Corolla.
