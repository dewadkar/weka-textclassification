            I've been driving a 1999 Honda Odyssey LX since March.  I've found it to be the most comfortable and reliable car I've ever owned.  

The dashboard and controls are extremely well laid out.  Everything is within easy reach, nothing is blocked from view by the steering wheel or shifting lever.

The sightlines outside of the car are good, minimizing blind spots and improving safety.  Tinted windows on all but the front windshield are not so dark as to impair vision, even at night.

The Odyssey is exceptionally quiet.  When my daughter is sitting in the far back seat, we can speak to her in only a slightly elevated tone of voice while travelling at freeway speeds.

The ease of removing, or repositioning the middle seats is great.  The back seat folds very quickly and neatly into the rear storage area and makes big, long flush surface for big loads when the middle seats are removed.

With all the seats in their upright positions, the storage area behind the rear seat is big enough to hold a huge amount of luggage or gear.  It is possible for us to go on a camping trip and fit all of our equipment in the car without sacrificing any seating.

The engine is smooth and powerful and takes you up big hills with ease.  The transmission shifts smoothly and doesn't do the jerking around that some automatic transmissions can do when you are at speed they don't like.

The optional tape/cd player has good sound quality, but lacks some features that I like, such as time tracking.  It will do programmed and random play and even the tape player has track finding.

There are lots of nice little touches.  The seven cup holders are all in useful locations, although a different size base would accommodate more standard beverage sizes.  The fold down surface between the drivers and passenger seat is very convenient.  The two power plugs for cell phones charging are conveniently located out of the way.  The interior integrity seems very good.

We had a hard time getting deliver on this van because they are so much in demand.  They are worth the wait.<br><br>
