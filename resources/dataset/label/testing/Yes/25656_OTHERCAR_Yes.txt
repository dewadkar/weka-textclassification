            I have owned a large variety of vehicles over the years (I have been driving since 1961), and my new Highlander really is among the very best. I took delivery of it in Tucson, Arizona, and immediately put over 2000 miles on it driving back to my home in Mexico. Except for two quibbles--no reasonable place to put my cell phone, and a ventilation fan that is too loud--the vehicle is just wonderful.

I am 6'2" tall, and this is the first vehicle I have owned for years--the last was a 1976 Dodge pickup--in which I do not have to put the drivers seat back as far as it will go for comfort. With the seat in an intermediate position I have lots of room to stretch my legs. The seat is also wide enough for real comfort, and well shaped and padded. I have the eight-way power seat, and this provides a large range of adjustments, including adjustable lumbar support, which is really helpful on a long drive. Even after an eight hour stint, I felt relaxed and completely uncramped.

The handling of this vehicle is very good. I say this as an owner and driver of several excellent sports cars, including a Corvette and a Triumph. Naturally, the Highlander is no sports car, and should not be driven over 80 or 85 mph (in my opinion), but for an SUV it corners very well, feels stable and capable, and has just enough isolation from the road without feeling mushy or spongy.

The engine and transmission are a real delight. There is ready torque at all engine speeds, so that the Highlander gets off the line very well, and is also ready to pass at highway speeds. Up and downshifts are smooth, and practically transparent. The overdrive defeat button is a real plus. I used it often on my drive. The 4WD system works well. I drove off the road right into deep sand with no loss of traction at all.

Gas mileage was good. I got 22 mpg overall on my 2000 trip. This might improve slightly when the vehicle is fully broken in.

My Highlander is not the limited model. Instead, I bought the standard model with some options: the preferred package which gives the power drivers seat, the convenience package which gives remote control entry, and the appearance package which gives alloy wheels and tinted glass. Then I added aftermarket leather, and a great set of aftermarket speakers to the stereo system. Bought this way, the vehicle cost about $2000 less than the limited model and is better in two ways: the aftermarket leather is much better than the factory leather, especially since all the surfaces are real leather, not just the seating surfaces as in the factory version, and the $300 stereo speakers I put in the front doors are very much better than the JBLs in the limited system. What the limited has that I did not get this way are: fog lamps, automatic climate control, rear spoiler. I highly recommend going this way unless you must have the climate control--obviously fog lamps can be added if you like and will not cost $2000.

In my opinion this vehicle is the best of all the SUV's, and is better than the more expensive Lexus version, which I did test drive, because it handles better and has more interior room (also is better looking to my eye).

If you are near Tucson, Joe Micoletti at Precision Toyota of Tucson, Arizona sold me this vehicle, and dealing with him was a pleasure--also he gave me a super price.

Good luck,

Robert
