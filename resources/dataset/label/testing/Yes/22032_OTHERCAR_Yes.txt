            I love the Nissan Maxima.  My parents first got a Maxima in 94 when I was a junior in high school.  We loved it so much, we got another one in 97.  When my brother graduated college, he bought himself a 97 Nissan Altima (he's the oddball).  When I graduated college, I bought a used 94 Maxima.  Our family still owns all the Nissans we've bought, and we intend to keep them for another few years at the very least.  I am a die-hard Nissan fan, and I firmly believe that for the money, you can't get a better car.

Nissan is a flailing company.  They've plunged themselves into financial dire straits due to poor marketing and other assorted factors, but they still produce a great car.  The Maxima was designed to be a step above the Accord and Camry (the Altima should be the direct competitor), but Honda and Toyota have marketed themselves well enough to convince the general public that they are all same-tier.  That's good news for me.  That means I can take advantage of Nissan's inability to optimize its yield on inventory and get a great car at a low price.  Nissan's failure is your fortune.

Nissan's V6 engine has been consistently rated as one of the best engines around for the past 10 years.  These cars will easily live to 150 to 200K miles.  The Maxima just won't break down (I qualify that by saying on models older than the 95 redesign, the transmission gets a little weak around 100K, but it's easily replaceable and will run as good as new afterwards).  The Maxima handles like a sports car -- it's a bit of a harder ride than a Lexus, but it does handle exceptionally well.  The interior is spacious and well appointed.  

I love my Maxima.  I love all our Maximas.  This is a car that makes sense.  <br><br>
