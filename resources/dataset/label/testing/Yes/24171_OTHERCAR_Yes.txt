            I have had this car since feb. 99 and it has been real dependable it has the 3.8 v/6 and i have found that that's enough power for me.  It simply performs and if you take care of it it will do for you.
I made sure this car wasn't abused when purchased i am the third owner. You can tell when they have been abused  for example seat wear, carpet wear funny smells.  
I just enjoy this car everyday. I don't care for the new hood, and lights on the recent models. This is the 24th year for camaro and they had it right. 

This is the first year for dex cool in the camaro and i found that mine has gummed up in a reddish color. I flushed it and added more dex but found it does the same thing.
I have read article after article that discusses that they have had problems ( any dex cool chevy). Mine is not overheating or anything so i'm leaving it alone for the time being.
I would recommend changing to regular green antifreeze if you are having problems. The dealer tells you not to but who listen's to them anyway??

My tires have lasted so far since 99 if this helps anyone out and there pep boys futura 235/55/r16

I have seen several chevrolet cars produced since 82. I would have to say that the current camaro is the best one they produce.  I have heard people are having trouble with their trucks, blazers. I would not personally buy any chevrolet that is currently made except the camaro.  The 96 impala/ caprice was the next best car they made but they stopped making those.  Many people are buying suv/truck buses and the camaro is also going away real soon. It's said to see that the camaro go just for gas guzzling suv/trucks. It's just real sad i wish something could get done about it.
