            If you want a cheap camera that won't advance the film leading to exposed rolls and ruined memories, then this is the camera for you.
I wanted to buy an inexpensive camera that was simple to operate and cheap enough that I didn't have to worry about leaving it somewhere or getting it stolen. It would take the place of my nice Cannon T50 (recommended)when I was out at the bars or on vacation. I paid $15.00 for this point-and -shoot 35mm Vivitar and excitedly loaded a roll of 24 exp. Kodak 400 and met my friends for a pint at my local pub. We had lots of laughs and shot the whole roll. The camera was serving it's purpose by letting me enjoy the night without constantly &quot;policing&quot; said camera. When the roll was done, I attempted to rewind the film and noticed that there was no resistance from the spindle. I opened it up and sure enough, the film had slipped off the spokes and had not rolled onto the spindle causing the entire roll to bunch up in the housing. Of course, when I opened the back the entire 24 exposures were ruined. Needless to say I was very disappointed as I had just lost the photo record of my fun night with my friends. The next roll of film...you guessed it, the same thing.

I know that you get what you pay for and I shouldn't expect a great camera for $15.00, but I do expect a camera that works.
I think that Vivitar needs to redesign the spindle on this camera.
I can't comment on the picture quality because I haven't loaded the camera a third time. Of course that would be hard to do now as the camera has been ground to pieces under my boot heel.<br><br>
