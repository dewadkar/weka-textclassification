            I have owned a total of four Jeeps in my lifetime.  Having said this, it should be obvious that I have a definite love for them.  This however does not imply that I think they are the best vehicles out on the road � or off.  It is a niche vehicle and not intended for an all-around competitor.  The finish quality is good � not excellent, it is loud on the road, the ride is rough when compared to a �car�, gas mileage is not great, and there is not much room to carry your gear or people.  All of this being said, I would still highly recommend this to the right type of person.  They are very fun vehicles that can take you basically anywhere you want to go.  You can choose to drive with a hard top on, a soft top, or no top at all!  Not many vehicles offer this type of variance.  
One of the most appealing aspects regarding Jeep vehicles is their ease of use and their simplicity.  My favorite models are the 1997-2001 Sport/Sahara TJ�s with the straight six cylinder engines.  Jeep made an impressive, drastic change in the performance of the Wrangler�s suspension, steering, engine, and overall ride quality as compared to the previous YJ models (1987-1995).  The TJ is actually a pleasure to drive on the highway and off.  You can easily get your Jeep up to 80 mph (not that I would recommend it!) and pass other vehicles.  It even feels pretty stable.  You still have to use caution when corning at high speeds.  I have never had a problem with any of my Jeeps rolling � a very close call in a 78� CJ-7 though.  The main thing is �just use your head�.  Off-pavement use is also a blast in a Wrangler.  Their new coil spring suspension is a great improvement and enables the owner to modify the jeep�s suspension easier.  The ride is also a lot smoother on the road too.  I have since upgraded my suspension with an Old Man Emu 2.5� lift to gain extra clearance and articulation in sticky off-road situations.  The ride quality is still excellent.  
The beauty of this vehicle is that you can actually use it as your daily commuter and take it to the mountains on the weekend for some excellent four wheeling, unlike many of the other so-called �sport utility vehicles�.  If you�re the type of person who likes to tinker with things and keep adding parts or modifying things�.this is the vehicle for you.  The just empty every pocket part of owning this vehicle is �.I have put approximately $3000 worth of extras on my current 97� Wrangler.  The list includes: winch; heavy duty front bumper; rock slide rails; heavy duty rear tire carrier/bumper; seat covers; aggressive tires; suspension system; overhead rack; and floor mats.  Even with all of the added weight of these extras (about 500 lbs.) my Jeep still gets about 16 mpg, not bad for a vehicle like this.  Since owning the Jeep I have had to replace the exhaust manifold � a distinctive �pinging� noise could be heard.  Also, regular maintenance items such as brake pads, etc. 
If your in the market for a TJ, here are a few points to consider:  1997 � new model year; 1998 � cruise control is an option; 1999 � new manual transmission (seems to shift smoother), updated heater/air control knobs, steering updated; 2001 � new soft top utilizing sail material (50% quieter than before) w/ tinted windows as an option, new console.  Good luck and If you have any further questions, please email me and I will try to help.
