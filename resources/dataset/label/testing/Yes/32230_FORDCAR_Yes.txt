            My dad has a 1995 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer Edition. This truck is very well suited up interior wise. It also is a vehicle that is reliable and will last a long time. My dad�s vehicle has been very well maintained but he in no way babied it. 

You see my father is the outdoorsy type, so as you can probably imagine he did a lot of riding it off road. We have gone through some really rough situations with the help of the push button four-wheel drive. As you might have heard Ford hubs sometimes have problems. Well for us this was true. The hubs went and the four-wheel drive would not engage because the hubs wouldn't lock. 

But if you ask me since it only cost $300.00 to fix and that�s the only maintenance it needed in five years it's a reliable vehicle. My dad loves it so much he will not get rid of it!
