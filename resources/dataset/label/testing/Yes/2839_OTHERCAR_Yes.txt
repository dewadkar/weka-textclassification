            <i>I guess now that I look back, I consider myself a very lucky (maybe spoiled) girl.  My parents decided to buy me a 1999 Prelude as my first car two years ago.  They knew that I wouldn't settle for anything less than a middle class car that was fun and sporty but then they also worried a lot about my safety.  So why you ask didn't I end up in a Volvo?  &quot;Oh my gosh, me in a Volvo?  Isn't that for Mommy's?&quot; =)

Being that I was still young, 18 at that time, my parents didn't want to invest a grip in getting me a BMW or something nicer so they decided on sticking to a Honda (I know how could they?!?!).  Well, my parents quickly ruled out Honda Civics, since they were known to be tin cans, Accords were ruled out next because they were just too family orientated, so the next step up was a Prelude.  After a lot of careful research, talking with a lot of people, and getting all tangled up in a mess with the sales reps at the dealer, the decision was finally made and on December 2, 1998, I drove home my brand new <b>Pearl White Honda Prelude</b> (base model) from the dealer.</i>    


<b>Exterior</b> - Rating: A

<i>Colors for 1999</i>: Premium White Pearl, Nighthawk Black Pearl, Milano Red, Ficus Green Pearl (in other words puke green), Crystal Blue Metallic
<i>New Colors for 2001</i>: Electron Blue Pearl, Satin Silver Metallic

Chances are that you've seen this car somewhere out on the road and it just made you look twice and hey, I don't blame you.  I remember when this model first came out in 1997 and I was dreaming that someday I would be driving it (dreams really do come true).  

I have heard some complaints about how the back end of the car looks too big compared to the 4th generation preludes, but in my opinion, I think it just makes the car look better.  The headlights are what I call my &quot;eyes&quot; and they add a cute little touch to the car reminding me of Mr. Herby.  You either like or don't like the headlights to the car.  I'll be honest and when I first got my car I hated the way the headlights just sat there on the hood, but over time it grew on me and now I absolutely love them.

Honda has been long known for their sporty designs of their cars and the Prelude does not let you down.  Overall, take one look at the body of the car and it just screams out at you...&quot;take me for a ride&quot;.  The cars sleek and innovative design make the car look fast and clean.  So does the inside hold up to it's looks outside?


<b>Interior</b> - Rating: B
If you are looking for a roomy car, then look elsewhere.  Even though the Prelude can seat up to 4, I would not recommend this car as a 4 seater.  Remember it's a sports coupe!  The car is quite roomy in front and seats two very comfortably, but when it comes to the back seat there's not much leg room at all.  I have been in the back seat a few times and it was a horrible experience.  By the time I got out of the car I had a horrible leg cramp.  From then on, I had a two rule person for my car.  I would never want someone to go through what I felt sitting back there.

All Preludes my year came with black interior so I didn't really have a choice.  If you live in a hot city (Los Angeles) like I do you tend to shy away from dark interiors, but surprisingly enough the black interior has never bothered me.  The pattern on the cloth seats can be a little irritating and tacky to the eye, but I was planning on ripping the interior out when I got the car so this set back didn't really affect my decision.

The dashboard is quite conservative for this sports car and I was a little disappointed especially since this was a sports car but nonetheless all the instruments are easy to read.  The windows, mirrors, and door locks are all powered making life easier on you.  The car even comes with a child lock for the passenger side window even though I do not recommend this car for family use.  The moonroof is also powered with a nice tilt feature that comes in handy when you want to show off your car.  The car looks great from the outside when the moonroof is open. 

Other standard features that come with the car are cruise control (something I never use), air conditioning/heater, an adjustable steering column, a height adjustable drivers seat, 12-volt power outlet, two front and one rear cup holders.  If you are a smoker, beware, this car does not come with an ashtray.

The 6-speaker, AM/FM/CD system that came with my car was wonderful and reliable.  I wouldn't change my stereo system in my car if you bought me a new one.  All CD's play fine (even burned CD's) and the sound is crystal clear.  I have been using this stereo everyday since the day I got it and it's still going.  I rarely clean it too.


<b>Performance</b> - Rating: A
Ok, you can call me a girl, but I opted for an automatic.  I can hear it now...How could you?  An automatic sports car?  Well, yes.  I do a lot of driving everyday and find myself stuck in traffic all the time so I can't imagine driving a 5-speed even though I know how.  Don't think I'm left out of the fun though.  

The base model prelude comes with <i>Sequential Sportshift</i>.  What's that?  It's basically driving a 4-speed without the clutch.  So, you're telling me that I can drive it manually changing gears without the clutch?  Yes, I am.  You get the control of a stick shift in the convience of an automatic.  No more riding that clutch in traffic!  I have a lot of fun driving my car in sportshift and all my friends are always dying to try it out. 

The car is powered by the VTEC 2.2 liter 4 cylinder engine which cranks out about 200 horsepower at around 7,000 rpms.  This engine is a very powerful engine especially since it's only 4 cylinders.  If you ever have the chance test drive a prelude and ask to feel the VTEC, you will be amazed.  You have to take the car up to at least 5,000 rpms at WOT (Wide open throttle) to feel the VTEC (tell your local dealer that if you plan on test driving this car).  You can be assured that I love to feel the power of my car every time I get on the freeway.

Now how about a brake check?  You don't have to worry about going quick when you can rely on the brakes that come with the car.  I always feel safe driving knowing that  I've got a good <i>anti-lock braking system</i> in my car, and trust me, I've tested it out before, it really works! 


<b>Handling</b> - Rating: A+
After I got my car, I decided to lower it an inch or so to get better handling and performance and let me tell you this car handles beautifully regardless if you modify anything on it at all.   I can take turns on the freeway going about 70-80 mph without braking or slowing down.  If anyone has ever driven the 110 Pasadena Fwy like I do everyday, you know your cars handles good when you don't have to brake at all zipping and zapping through the turns.  


<b>Gas Mileage</b> - Rating B
This car only eats up <i>Premium</i> fuel so it can get a little expensive, but for the performance that my car gives me it's all worth it. I get about 24-25 miles per gallon which isn't that bad for a sports car.  Most of those miles are from highway driving so, if you drive the streets a lot you will probably average a little less than that per gallon.


<b>Noise and Ride</b> - Rating: B
If you are looking for a sleeper car, this car could disappoint you.  My mom thought that my car was a little noisy, but for a Honda, it was not bad at all.  You can just tell slightly when you gas it through your engine and exhaust, but hey isn't that part of the fun of driving a sports car?  I like hearing my baby <i>purrrrr</i>.

Again, this is a sports car so the ride isn't smooth sailing.  You can expect the ride to be a little bumpy at times, but overall it does not bother me at all.  It's fairly smooth on the highway.  If you are looking for something with a smoother ride, check out Lincoln, I heard their cars ride like the wind.


<b>Safety</b> - Rating: A
The Prelude is protected by a state-of-the-art <i>&quot;lmmobilizer&quot;</i> anti-theft system. Your key is digitally coded with a radio signal and when you insert the key into your ignition, a signal is transmitted to a control unit and if the key is recognized, your car starts.  If there are attempts to start the car without the key, the car will automatically disable the engine's fuel injection and ignition systems, reducing the chances of someone stealing your car.

The car comes equipped with dual-air bags (SRS) and 3-point sealtbelts to help keep you secure in your car at all times.  The car is also built with front, side, and rear &quot;crush zones&quot; that help provide better protection in case of an accident.  

Now trust me on this one, I have been in some minor fender benders in my car and it's still in one piece.  You can ask my boyfriend about this too, I accidentally rear-ended him with my car two times.  Can you tell he really loves me? 


<b>Other Options</b>
You can choose to get a rear spoiler for about 500 dollars more, but I didn't opt in for this.  I like my cars clean and sleek without things hanging off it.  Many people say that this car looks a lot better with the spoiler on and most Preludes that I see have this option, but I guess I just wanted to be different. 


<b>Maintenance</b>
I get an oil change once every three months, or every 7,500 miles, whichever one comes first.  I take my car in regularly for the checkup services and nothing has gone wrong with my car and I have almost 40,000 miles on it.  Hondas are very reliable cars and bottom line, you can't go wrong unless you get a lemon (but wait, that's Toyota of Orange!).


<b>Conclusion</b>
I hope I didn't just completely bore you all with a review of my car.  I can almost guarantee you that you will love the way this car drives, handles, and purrs right beneath your eyes. If you are in the market for a new sports car that is loaded with all of today's latest technology at an affordable price, be sure to test drive one of these babies out and let me know if you end up getting one.  I'd love to race you! =) Vroom Vrrooommm and away she goes....
