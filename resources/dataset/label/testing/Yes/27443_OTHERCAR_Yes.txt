            I bought my Neon in Summer '97 with about 33,000 miles on it.  It is now over 3 years latter and I've driven it another 45,000 miles.  It is nearly impossible to find a car that gets 30 MPG and will do 0-60 in less than 9 seconds and costs as little as a Neon.  I have the 4 door standard version with an automatic transmission and very little in the way of extras.  

My Neon has been fairly reliable.  I have had 2 small problems.  First the rear passenger side break squeaks all the time and I've had it looked at twice.  Each time they fix it for a few months and then it is back to squeaking.  My turn signal doesn't automatically reset after left hand turns so I have to remember to manually turn it off.  Each of these problems falls into the 'annoying' category and I don't consider them major.  These are the ONLY problems that I've had with the car in 3 years and 45,000 miles.  For a cheap car like the Neon, that isn't too bad in my opinion.

The car is comfortable.  You can fit 4 adults easily in the standard 4 door.  The seats are OK and I make 6 hour road trips at least 6 times a year.

The best thing about the Neon is that it is quick and fun to drive.  It has plenty of power and I've never encountered a hill it had problems with.  On the freeway, it doesn't break a sweat up to speeds of 90 MPH.  I haven't taken it over 100 MPH myself but don't doubt it could easily do so.

One down side is that the road noise is rather high.  The car doesn't squeak or rattle or anything, but it is not very well insulated from the noise of the tires on the road or the wind against the car.  It is relatively loud at higher speeds.

If you are expecting too much from the Neon then you will be disappointed.  This is a cheap car so don't look for a high quality interior or anything like that.  But for it's price range, this is probably one of the best vehicles made.

*Update March 2001*

In the past few months I've had a couple minor failures on the car.  First the oil light came on and it turned out the sensor was out.  Took $100 to fix under extended warranty.
Second, I had the engine light go on.  The dealership has said that a part needs to be replaced for about $200-300.  The car has been running just fine the whole time irregardless of the lights coming on, but I have now had to take it into the shop a couple times.  The car has about 74,000 miles now.
