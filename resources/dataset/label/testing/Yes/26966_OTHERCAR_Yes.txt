            My husband and I went out looking for a new car at the beginning of the year and heard about the 0,0,0,01 deal from Mitsubishi on the Galant.  (It was the deal where you put O down, 0 payments, 0 interest until 2001.)  We thought well it is worth a try Car and Driver did name it number one in it's class.  We decided to see what the Galant had to offer.

The 2000 Galant was amazing.  I drove one from &quot;95&quot; and was not impressed, but the new 2000 V-6 one was impressive.  The seats were comfortable the car was extremely quiet and the ride was smooth and this is one car that can get up and go.

The styling on the inside and out screams luxury sedan.  I would have never put Mitsubishi up there with the Toyota and Honda, but now with the new Galant that is definitely where they belong.  If you are looking for a nice sedan that looks and feels like luxury and you don't want to pay the luxury price check out the Galant.  Even if you can afford the luxury price this car will amaze you.

The price tag on the car was only $20,000 which for a car like this it is a great price.  I now see why Car and Drive named it number one.                                <br><br>
