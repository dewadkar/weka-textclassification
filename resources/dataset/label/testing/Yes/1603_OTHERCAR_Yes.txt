            &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ONE YEAR UPDATE - JANUARY 2001&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Just to update our experience with this car, after one year and about 14,000 miles we have not had (knock on wood!) one problem. Not even the slightest, tiniest problem. It remains reliable, solid and fun to drive. 

It even seems to shed dirt! The lighter color doesn't show the dirt like its darker colored predecessor. I don't think I'll ever buy a dark color car again.

The only maintenance has been an oil change every 3,000 miles - that's it!

I would still highly recommend the Prizm.

I'll continue to update this from time to time or if problems develop.

     ------------------------------------


We purchased 3 cars recently. The 3 cars we replaced had almost 500,000 combined miles on them so we were due! One of the three new cars is a 2000 Chevy Prizm which was purchased instead of its Toyota Corolla clone because of an accumulated $6000 GM MasterCard rebate. (The GM MasterCard offers 5% of your purchases back in the form of a rebate towards a GM car. The maximum rebate you can accumulate is $500 per year for 7 years but used to be $1000 per year maximum.)

It's a beautiful little car outside but the inside is more econobox looking. The seats are firm and comfy but a little thin. The cheap looking instrumentation brings back bad memories of a 1970 Pinto as does the sound of the poor quality radio.

But...I knew all that going in. What you get for the money is an extremely reliable and dependable little car that is fun to drive. The engine is a smidge too &quot;buzzy&quot; on the highway for my liking but none-the-less has plenty of pickup and power for our needs. Gas mileage has been about 26 - 28 MPG. Handling is excellent - as good as my old Infinity G20 - and that is saying a lot! A front stabilizer bar really helps and is a welcome addition to a car in this price range.

In 4,200 miles there has not been the slightest problem or need to return to the dealer. There is not a flaw or rattle to be found. By reputation I can expect a long trouble free life which is why I bought it. So far, my research has paid off.

It just seems that for a little money, Chevrolet can upgrade the interior a bit and make this truly the best small car going. All in all, I would highly recommend my Prizm to anyone.
