            After owning a '97 Integra, driving it 135,000 hard miles over six years, having it give me not a day's trouble and getting a cash buyer 24 hours after I put it up for sale, I felt if I didn't at least consider the next-generation Integ, now known as the RSX, that god would punish me.

I was hesitant only because I couldn't convince myself to like the exterior. Many a night I would drive by the dealer lot, hoping that at some angle, with some moonlight passing over it, that I could get to like the aesthetics of the car. I couldn't, not even visualizing it in Tafetta white and having the rocker panels below the door painted from black to white. And I wasn't going to pay $1400 for all-around spoilers.

I finally went inside the showroom. Upon inspecting the car, I was astounded by how many major improvements they made. For example, that annoying hatch cover is now hidden under the rear door in a much-improved mesh material. Absolutely brilliant, it will be imitated, I'm sure (are you listening, Mistu Eclipse motors?). They also put a nice big handle on the back door, another nice touch.  Inside, that balky slide lever to adJust the temperature is now a nice big knob and turns smooth as silk. The dash is gorgeous and that gauze-like material over the top cuts down on glare. The radio now faces you. Ergonomics? Can't be improved upon..if you close your eyes and reach where your hands naturally fall, that's where everything is. Honda's engineers are all magna cum laude. Perfect driving position. The power windows move faster and don't wobble anymore. All in all, you get inside, shut the door, crank the engine, put it in gear and everything tells you this is a Honda product--quality with a capital "Q".

Although the same width as the old model, cabin space in front seems less obtrusive. The front passenger's legs never bumped into the shifter, an annoyance in the old model. Driving position and entry/exit is remarkably comfortable for a car of this type, as is the additional headroom, even with sunroof.

On the road--at idle, the engine purrs like a car costing many G's more. Short-throw gearbox still a winner. On-center feel of the steering wheel felt so secure, I felt tempted to put my hands behind my head. Steering has right amount of boost, plenty of feedback when you turn it.

Downside? Out on the open road, I took 1st and 2nd gears to 5500rpm. Despite having 20 more ponies and 15 lb-ft more torque kicking in 1000rpm lower, I did not feel an appreciable amount of increased power over the old model. I thought the variable valve timing would give more power in the mid range, but that did not happen, even with the a/c turned off. These multi-valve 4cyl engines are great to rev and will last forever but off-the-line they just don't happen. The salesman reminded me that the higher priced Type S model has 40 more horses but I reminded him that the xtra HP is available above 6000rpm and actually has LESS torque than the base model. Horsepower SELLS a car but TORQUE is what pushes it from a stand-still.

Also, I did notice that on secondary roads, the ride gets VERY busy and the cabin rocks like you're on rocky sea. For a car modestly priced at twenty grand, weighing in at 2600lbs, it's not unexpected. Another reviewer complained that the rear end kicks out when pushed to the limit. Again, remember this is a sport-luxo version of a Civic. It is not going to handle like a Prelude but then again it's not $26G like the Prelude (which ultimately led to it's demise). And it won't be as resistant to bumps as the CL, at an additional 1/2 ton curb weight (and additional ten grand).

This, combined with my dislike of the exterior, is making this a most difficult decision.

If looks and major acceleration are non-factors for you, then by all means, run, do not walk to your Acura dealer and put down a deposit on this car. Manual trans is a must in the base model (Type S comes ONLY with a stick).

Finally, one minor note: the sound system in the base model is underwhelming. I'd rip out the head unit and, for as little as two hundred bucks, install a detachable-face Kenwood or JVC, it will MARKEDLY improve the sound.
