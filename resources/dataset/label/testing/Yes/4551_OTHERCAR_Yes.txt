            I have a  35mm camera that I've enjoyed using, but I've lately the majority of my pictures end up being scanned & e-mailed to family members.  Waiting to finish rolls of film before I can show them the "latest & greatest" things we've done was getting old.  We shopped around looking at various digital cameras, and this one gave the most bang for the buck & had the "feel" of a real camera.  Many other digital cameras we looked at felt flimsy at best.

I've also been doing more photo editing, and the software that came with the camera has worked well for enhancing pictures.  This is a great working camera.  We've been to the beach, and recently I took it to a retirement party.  I had a 32MB card with me and towards the end of the party I went back home for a few minutes, uploaded the pictures onto my computer via the USB port and saved them on a CD which I then brought back and gave to the guest of honor at the end of the party.

Battery life has been a lot longer than I expected.  The salesperson said that digital cameras are huge drains on their batteries, but this hasn't been a problem so far.  

One of my favorite things about this camera is the fact that you can use it either as "point and shoot" where the camera does all the work for you, or you can play around with the settings to get just the shots you want.
