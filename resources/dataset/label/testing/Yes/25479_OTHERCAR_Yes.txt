              My husband had looked at Saturns before we were married.  And he was really impressed with them.  Due to money we could not afford a Saturn when we married but we bought a used car from a Saturn dealership, which was not a Saturn. They were great about fixing anything that was wrong with it.  We able to buy a Saturn in late 1998.  The dealership was very helpful and did not pressure us to add any package on the car.  We knew we wanted a Saturn because my husband knew he send me to have the oil changed and not come back paying hundreds of dollars for work that was not needed.  Safety record and price were a couple of other reason.   When we bought the car it had 185 miles on it.  Now almost two years later it has almost 30,000 miles on it.  The car is a pleasure to drive.   We drive the car everywhere.  With cruise control traveling long distance is a joy. 


 The only problems I have had is that the car would not start twice.  One time I took the car to the dealership on a Saturday and the there were not a whole a lot of people to work on it.  I was giving a rental until Monday so that the could try to find out the problem.  The lack of space is another problem. Now that we have two children the back seat is a bit crowded.  Truck space is limited too.  We are going to buy a LS2 to solve the problem of room.


  I think a Saturn would a be a great choice for anyone. You never have to haggle with the dealer to a get the best price. I always say Saturn is the kind of dealership where you see a price for on the window for what is on the car and you pay that for it.  If you want it cheaper just take  off the some off the options and it will be cheaper.

  Overall I think buying a SL2 was the best buying decision were every made.<br><br>
