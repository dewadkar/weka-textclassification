            I have driven a chevy camaro for around three months.The year 1990.Even though the car has some drawbacks,the good parts about the car over rule the bad.My best thought about the car is that it is a great look on almost anybody.The model comes with some good options.You can either purchase a camaro with a v-6 or a v-8.Most real tough guys choose the v-8 because of the thought that it is much better.That is not entirely true.Although the larger v-8 has a little more get go the v-6 doesn't change too much and is a little better on the wallet and the gas tank.My camaro was a teal with black highlites.I can tell you one thing,That car gets alot of attention from people.Another thing is that the car has an awesome sence of power when you rev that baby up.The camaro isnt the fastest but for the price it rules many nice expensive cars.I raced a 99 mustang and smoked him.The camaro cost me a genorous $3,150.Not too bad.The year still looks modern and keeps the muscle look to it.The only downsides to the car is if you want to take the car on a long vacation with the kids.The back seets are pretty tight.I noticed that after driving the car for a couple thousand miles the stearing gets sticky.I have no clue why.I know alot about cars and they are my hobby to work on,and I can tell you this car isnt that hard to work on.You can buy a basic set of items to juice up the car such as,Headers,air filter,cam gears,A nice exhaust and a nice set of all season tires(expecially in wisconsin).These are the items I always make sure to put on my cars.Overall the 91' camaro is a great buy with good looks and performance.
