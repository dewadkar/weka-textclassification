            Hey folks,

For those of you who are looking into getting the Accord Coupe EXV6, you are going to be getting TONS out of the car, in that all the options are not options.  They're all standard!  And what's even better for the people who are buying the 2001 model, you're going to be getting an in-dash 6 disc changer as a standard and you get even better looking rims than the 99 model.

I went all out on my car.  I got the EXV6 in Flamenco Black Pearl with a dealer installed underbody spoiler kit and rear wing spoiler.  That threw on about another $2K, but was WELL worth it because it makes my car look THAT much sportier.  And seeing how everyone has that car now, that underbody spoiler kit is the only thing that makes my car special :)  The only drawback was the fact that the V6 wasn't available in a manual transmission.  Some people were saying that there was a &quot;delay&quot; in the pick up, but no worries folks!  All you need to do is to throw it into 3rd gear and trust me, you will just take off!

So now that I've raved about the car, I'm gonna have to be completely honest by letting people know about the problems I've had with my car as well.  These are minor problems, but you should be aware of them anyway.  The fuel gauge never reads full.  I took it back to the dealer and they told me that it was a common problem for the V6 cars.  However, they did replace it and it was under warranty.  Another problem is the clock light.  It works intermittently.  That was also replaced.  So you see, minor stuff.  Performance has never been a problem.  And I'm now at 28K miles.

Here are questions to any other accord coupe owners:

1 -have any of you had problems with the brakes?  the braking time/distance leaves a lot to be desired.  My old little corolla had even better brakes than my new accord.  I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the fact that it was assembled in the states instead of Japan?

2 -second order of business --&gt;have any of you noticed that the body just doesn't flow very well?  My hood isn't flush with the side panels.  But I've looked at other coupes and they look better than mine, but they're 98s (you can tell the difference because the side mirrors don't move).  Is it just a 99 thing?

Any comments/answers would be much appreciated!
-------------------------------------
One more thing to note:  
My friend has the 98 EXV6 model, got into a car accident, and his driver side airbag worked, but the passenger side airbag didn't.  Hmmmmm...That's scary.  But good thing there wasn't a passenger with him...When he took it to the dealer, they couldn't explain why the passenger side airbag did not deploy.

If you're looking to compare the accord coupe with the toyota solara, please don't.  The handling on the Solara is a joke.  Wishy washy handling.  I don't know why they even claim to call it a &quot;sports coupe&quot; because it isn't.  Forget it.  BUY the accord.  Honda!  Aside from that, happy car buying!<br><br>
