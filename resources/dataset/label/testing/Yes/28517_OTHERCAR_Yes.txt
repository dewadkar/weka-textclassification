            The SAAB 9-3 convertable is a great car for almost 39,000 bucks (what I paid for mine.) The interior is semi-luxurious, it has a good sound system, leather seats, however the back seats are not so spacious. What is great however is the power, speed, and finnese about the car. The top comes off rather easily, and I havn't had many problems with it. The color of my car, bright red looks very nice, especially in a hot summer day. I love the convertible, it's good for picking up chicks around the strip or any place else I go on the west cost. The car gets great gas mileage, but once again, I think it's too small for a two-door hatchback. It does need some minor alterations, but I think it would be great for anyone who wants speed and power in a convertible. <br><br>
