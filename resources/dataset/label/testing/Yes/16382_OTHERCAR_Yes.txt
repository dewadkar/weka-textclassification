            Amazing new way to see your shots as soon as you take them!!!  I like this new digital camera because it takes the guess work out of photography.  
Until now I spent several weeks completing a roll of 24 or 36 photos and hung around WalMart waiting for them to be developed.  Now the feedback is instant and the price wasn't bad either.
Watch out when you take backlit photos that there is not enough light from the flash to show people's faces.
Also watch out that your hard drive has enough space to download the entire contents of the camera at once.  There doesn't seem to be a way to download just one photo.
After you download photos the software allows you to play around with them on the screen.  This is really fun for kids to do.  Even 2 year olds can handle it.<br><br>
