            Bought this van with the need for a newer van with more room and comfort for future family members.  We went to a dealership where we trusted the sales people &amp; told them what we were looking for &amp; our price range (around $10K).  We were told we would be lucky to find a newer mini van for that price, but he would check out what was on the lot. 

The first van we came to was it...  The 1994 Dodge Grand Caravan LE, 4 captian's chairs, and a bench in the back.  It has A/C, Cruise Control, Power Windows, Power Locks &amp; we were in love!  It was &quot;decked out&quot; with all the bells and whistles we could ever want.

It was only $10500 just right.  We test drove it &amp; I was amazed at how easily it drove &amp; how smooth of a ride it had.  So we bought it.

Now 9 months later we are still in love with it...  Only had to have in shop once for the serpentine belt tensioner to be replaced (there is a service bulletin out on that).

It is fun to drive, the cruise control is very easy to use, the A/C works well and it has a great sound system stock in it.

The only complaint I would have is getting used to how large it is and getting used to parking it &amp; driving through tight places (Bank drive ups).<br><br>
