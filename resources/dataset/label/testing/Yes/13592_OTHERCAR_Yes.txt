            My husband and I bought a 1996 Mazda Miata in early October.  It is the one car that satisfied both of our qualifications: he was looking for a sports car he could really &quot;throw around,&quot; and all I wanted was a good looking, affordable convertible.  We found everything we wanted in the Miata.  We couldn't believe how much fun this car was, especially for the price.  We paid under $15,000 for our used Miata, and it's been one of the best investments we've made.  Amazingly enough, my husband's 6'2&quot;, 210lb. frame fits *comfortably* in both the driver's seat, and the passenger's (though he doesn't spend much time as a passenger).  It's got a great stereo, with speakers in both the seatback and headrest.  The only thing it's missing is a CD player, though I think we'll put a changer in the trunk.  I'd advise anyone buying a Miata to put door guards on the ridge of the door base, as we find it's difficult not to scuff the floor of the door when getting in and out.  The car handles great and is relatively quiet for a convertible.  The trunk is small - as expected - but fits a set of golf clubs and small luggage bags.  There isn't another car on the market today that I'd recommend as highly as the Miata for summertime fun and overall satisfaction.<br><br>
