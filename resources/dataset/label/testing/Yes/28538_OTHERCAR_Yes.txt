            We were in the market for a new car that combined the speed &amp; handling of our Honda S2000 (which we kept), the utility of our Toyota Tacoma (lease is up), and the four door comfort of a sedan.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee V8 had the speed but horrible handing, so we were left with two wagons - the Saab 9-5 Aero and the BMW 323.  The 9-5 Aero was bigger, better looking, much more comfortable, much faster, and a size-and-a-half larger - not to mention much cheaper if you lease, given the astonishing subsidized leases Saab is offering.  So we went with the 9-5 Aero wagon, black/tan.

Let's start with the pros, in case you are looking at similar vehicles.  The power from the 230hp aero engine is truly awesome; it's not the 0-60 sprints that will impress you, it's the truly effortless 50-90 power that blows even our S2000 away unless we drive the hell out of it.  At the same time, the ride is extremely comfortable - the most comfortable of any car I've ever had - and with the exception of torque steer discussed below, the handling will exceed most people's expectations and is close to the 323.  The power really is amazing; it's hard to keep the car at 70-75 even with cruise control because it just wants to keep going to 90-100.  The BMW just doesn't have this kind of torque - not even the 330 sedan.  I also love the styling; the BMWs and Audis are all so derivative of each other - people stop and stare at the Aero wagon at the Stanford mall, but they pass by the 911 and CLK430 convertibles.  They only make something like 5000 wagons a year, and less than 1000 are Aeros as I understand.  So it's unique.  It is also very, very spacious in the front, back, and luggage compartment.

Two real cons: torque steer and quality.  I had read a lot of reviews of the 9-5 Aero, and they all noted that while the 9-3 Viggen had preposterous torque steer, that the superior balance of the 9-5 and its additional weight had cured the problem.  Well, they are wrong.  Granted, in every day driving, there is no torque steer.  But when you floor it on an on-ramp, or at any speed below 40 or so, it's there.  It's not dangerous, but it's low quality - you have to actively correct the steering.  When you punch the 323/330 or S2000 (both rwd), they just glide.  I don't regret having bought the car, because I test drove it first, but a real purist who doesn't appreciate the other attributes of the Saab might pass for this reason alone and go rwd/awd.  Quality is also a little disappointing considering we are used to Hondas and Toyotas; the sunroof rattles, the car came misaligned, the bolts in the fender wells had some corrosion, and there were some chips in the paint in the tailgate.  All are being fixed this week, and none suggests fundamental quality problems, but I was very disappointed given that the list price of the car is $45k (don't pay anything near that though), and that Saab wants to be a luxury brand.  Also, compared to the S2000 or the BMW at least, the manual is mushy and unfun - the auto is a must.

The bottom line is that I love the 9-5 Aero, but if I didn't need the space or all its speed, and if I wasn't sick of the BMW image and derivative styling, the 323 or 528 wagons might be a better choice.

UPDATE:

I drove a base 1999 9-5 2.3t auto sedan with 11,000 miles as a loaner while my Aero was in the shop for its 1000 mile service + getting the sunroof, other rattles and alignment fixed.

A few observations after being able to drive a new 230hp Aero back to back with an 11,000 mile loaner with 170hp:

- the loaner buzzes like a bee hive.  there are multiple rattles from the dash, and the sunroof rattles almost as badly as my aero.  real long term quality concerns here.  also, these buzzes and rattles are pretty embarrassing on what is supposed to be a luxury car.
- this one is out of alignment, too.  i hope this isn't a weakness in 9-5's: it is very annoying to have a car that easily goes out of alignment
- avoid the cloth seats, at least in beige.  the rental's seats were very dirty and looked terrible.
- there is absolutely no torque steer on the 170hp version.  it is also quite slow - i couldn't live with it.  but it all you want is a swedish taurus with snappier styling, 170hp might be enough.
- the sport suspension on the Aero isn't THAT great.  the base 2.3t is definitely floatier (and therefore also less comfortable in my mind), and leans more in the corners, but frankly it's good enough for the 170hp engine.
