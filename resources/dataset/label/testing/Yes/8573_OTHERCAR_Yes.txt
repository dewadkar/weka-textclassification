            I bought my 94 Grand Am GT in June of 2000, with 58,000 miles on it. I've put this car to the test, a little over a year since I bought it, now with 89,000 miles on it. This car is quick, getting on the freeway is no problem and just touching the gas at red lights will get you going in no time. I don't know how well it does with the little 4-cylinder. It handles curves really well, with the right tires, low profile on mine. Usually the sings on the side of the road that say "take curve at 20mph" you can usually do 20mph or more. This car is great on gas, with a 15.2 gallon tank i get about 320 miles to a tank, when I was driving 40 miles each way on a trip on the freeway I would get closer to 400, but thats with light touches to the gas pedal, when I first got the car I would floor it all the time and still get at least 280 miles to the tank. 
The set backs that I've encountered have been the brakes, I've had to replace the pads twice. The first time everything had to be done all around and cost me $400. I think the person that owned it before me didn't really care how well the stopped. The pads were under warranty so I got them fixed for free. Brake dust does build up on the rims, they have to be cleaned about every week to keep them looking presentable. I also had to take my car to the tranny shop, as common on most Grand Am's, there is a lockup on the torque converter, cost me about $300 to get fixed. The power door locks went, no big deal. The only thing that this car didn't have that I wanted was a sunroof, which I had put in for about $250. The one for this model has to be a certain size and is the only one you can get.
