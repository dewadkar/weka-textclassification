            We purchased out 1993 Dodge Caravan in 1997 because we had just had twins the year before and were expecting again. 
It is the best vehicle we have ever owned and having 3 kids, it is very roomy! 
It has many features we like alot, such as rear defoggers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, am/fm cassette player and air bags, just to name a few. The only thing we didn't want when we were looking for a van is all the power thing, such as power windows and locks, having three Dodge mechanics in the family, we know they are very expensive to replace. 
I love driving my van, sometimes I have to open the window or door to listen and see if the motor is running because it is so quiet. It is a very smooth ride, hardly any bumpiness at all.
I love everything about my van, it is very comfortable to drive and I feel very safe driving it. Even the gas mileage is great for a six cylinder. 
There is plenty of leg room for up to seven people to fit comfortably.
I would recommend this van for anyone with a larger family or for anyone who travels alot.
