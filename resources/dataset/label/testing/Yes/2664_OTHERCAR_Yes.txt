            My wife and I always wanted a Jeep Wrangler. It took a while to arrive, but we ordered it with certain options that weren't on any dealers lot.  I'll try to be as detailed about the whole process with buying and driveing the Jeep as possible. First is the most important part is the pricing. A loaded Wrangler can cost (sticker) $24,000+. A stripped down one(I mean no back seats, only front speakers) can cost under $15,000.  You need to see what you want, need and could live with out. I feel the best way is to order one, get things that you want, some things are grouped in a package, but some are not. Origianly we were going to try to save money, by getting the four cylinder model, the SE.  With this you basically get nothing with it. Automatic is extra, the sound bar (two speakers on the over head bar)package with the backseat is about $1000. Next step up is the Sport package. The sport package is basically, the in-line six cylinder engine and the sound bar package. The next step up is the Sahara model, this has more options standard that most can be purchased seperately, and also has a palm tree logo on the sides and rear tire cover. Most options and things that would normally come with a car, you would have to pay extra for. The standard doors are half doors, with canvas and plastic zip-out windows. Full metal doors, with glass windows cost around $125. The doors are removable, no power options, and the windsheild comes down. The soft top of the jeep is less noisy than earlier models, but a hard top(2 person job to remove) is avaiable for about $900, or both is available for $1500. As you can tell at this point, things start to add up. Currently an automatic 3 speed transmission is aviable and no extra charge for a six-cylinder engine. Normally cost about $625. Air conditioning cost $890. Some places and situations you need air conditioning, so this was something we needed.

Originally we were going to purchase a 4 cylinder SE, with the sound bar, dual tops, automatic and air conditoning. The cost almost came out to what we actually decided. I test drove a 1999 4 cylinder and it was very sluggish. I drove a used one, because I figured how long is the car new. This was a good idea. It was slow. A vehicle weighing this much (about 3000 lbs) need a little more power. My wifes car is a Toyota Corolla 4 cylinder, and it seamed to move quicker. So we went for the Sport with the I-6, and sacraficed the milage(but by not much)with out the dual tops, just the soft. We live in an apartment with no room for the hard top, plus saved some money. The Sport,$19,155.00, came with the sound bar, the back seats and the auto would be no-cost. I know most people think you should get a manual transmission with a Jeep, but this car would have two drivers. My wife, although should can drive it, is not comfortable with a manual. So free automatic, no problem, their going to build it from scratch any way. We also got a few other things, speed control (a must for long trips, in my mind) $300, Side steps (my wife is small and would need the help if she was wearing a dress) $75, full doors $125, Soft top, Tint for the soft top windows $125, CD player (have a burner, no need for tapes) $125, air conditioning $895, Sentry key Immobilezer (no hot wireing the car, we shall see) $75. Didn't get cloth seat for an extra $140, the paterns are ugly and we could always buy covers for the vinyl seats. Please not these prices were all sticker prices, in New Jersey. I did not pay these prices. The prices I paid were "invoice" price. about 4-6% less then the above mentioned prices. My sister used to work at another auto dealer, got me those prices, and they matched it. It was a better dealer, where we got the Jeep, so I didn't mind that they matched it. Saved over $1250 off the sticker and that was fine for me. I didn't have much to bargin with since they had to order it and I wasn't doing the a favor by getting one in stock. 

It took about 6-7 long weeks to come in. But when it did it was worth it. Beautiful. I feel in love. All the little details, such as the Jeep is all black, the soft top, even the tires were all black. On the pricing sticker, the top had :This Jeep was especially made for my name. We got the vinyl seats, they are a solid slate grey, but every one thinks they are leather. The body is all metal(beside the plastic tires flares) and looks great. Also at the time Diamler-Crystler actually had a sales promotion so we got special intrest rate on the loan.

The Wrangler itself:
I feel it might not be for every one. The ride is smoother than older jeeps, but still is bumpy. It was made with off-roading in mind, not going to the country club. It doesn't get great milage, about 16 miles per gallon, but you do have great fun driving it. Taking the top off is time consuming, but with worth it. It comes with a video, watch it. It took along time with just the driver manual. For quick trips I like to just take out the back window, but it is really fun with out the top. I love it. There is a draw back its not to friendly for storage. With four adults in it there isn't much room for anything. The little trunk can hold about 2 maybe three grocery bags. Its more like a two seater with stuff or just four people. Its small, but roomy for the passengers. Im not average size, 6'4" and I fit comfortable. Maybe just because I like it so much, I'm blinded by the size. The air conditioner cools off the front passagers, the rear doesn't get it as much. Its still a soft top, so its not a freezer.

Over all I think it was a great purchase for my wife and me. We love it. We like the ruggedness of it and the tough, metal body. Its doesn't have rosewood console or climate control sections. Its a Jeep. A tough, 4 wheel drive machine. Although more modern than earlier models, it is still not a Lexus or BMW 4-wheel drive grocery getter, nor claims to be. If you want a leather power seats, power windows, digital dash and expensive extras, don't get a jeep. If you want a basic vehicle, with the things you need and the toughness to do serious off-roading, go test drive one. Test drive one to see what its like and ask people that have one. The internet has a lot of info and Yahoo has a few clubs that you can read info on posts and ask questions. People that have a Jeep Wrangler love to talk about it.  

Most people that own a Jeep wrangler are a different type of owner. They like to personlize them, take them out and treat them like one of the family. There is sense of connection to other Wrangler owners. They wave to each other as they pass each other by on the road. There is a lot of tradition, over 60 years, associated with the Jeep. I am certainly glad we purchased on and are every happy with it. 

Some quick pros and cons(in no order of importance):

Pros:
Best 4 wheel drive vehicle
No extra stuff you'll never use
Convertable
Very respectable vehicle
Smoother ride & less-noisy than older models
Long tradtion
Very Fun
Alot of products for after-market add-ons
Price

Other Wrangler owners waiving at you

Cons:
Mileage
Room for storage
Time consuming for taking top down
Seeing sad people's face that dont own one(I was serious untill that one)
