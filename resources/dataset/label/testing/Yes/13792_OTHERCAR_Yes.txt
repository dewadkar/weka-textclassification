            I bought this truck because I liked its looks. It looks like more truck for the money.
I like the spacious cab and everything is handy, all the little cubby holes come in handy. It has a large adjustable beverage holder located close to the floor which should help eliminate spills.
It sits up high and makes you feel like you are driving a big rig, but it handles very well. It's a little hard for older people to get in because of the height.
Anyone who likes pickups should like a dodge pickup. Older people should choose something lower to the ground.<br><br>
