            Having been fortunate to have had a succession of fine, fast cars - my wife became pregnant with our second child. 

This imminent arrival meant that my then-current car (a '96 Porsche 911 C4) probably wouldn't fit any more. The backseats are fine for kids to sit, but then there's nowhere to put all their paraphernalia, you see...

As someone who changes his car at least once a year, I viewed the new baby as an opportunity for another purchase, so off we went on the hunt.

I usually have an aversion to 4 door cars - so the first port of call was BMW, where I tested a series of M3s - Coupes and Convertibles. 
While undoubtedly quick and nice, I could never live with that featherlight steering - nor the slightly brash image - so we went to Lexus. Unfortunately, my wife hated the GS300 looks. 

So maybe an imported STi Subaru Impreza WRX? Undoubtedly a Good Car. At least as quick in real terms as the 911, but a very cheap interior, and it all felt a bit lightweight. 
So did the Impreza 22B. 
And the Mitsubishi EVO VI. 
Maybe a Jaguar XJR? 
No. Just too big.

As a very last resort, I went to Mercedes to look for an SL, or maybe a CE (I don't like the look of the CLK). 

And this is where I saw my new car. A Metallic Black AMG C43 with a black and silver interior.
A short test drive later, and we were discussing p/x and finance. This thing was THAT good. 

Ultimately, I know it's probably not as quick as my 911s had been. Ultimately, the steering is probably no better than that of the M3. Ultimately, it's not as nimble as the Subarus or EVOs. 
Nor is it as luxurious as the Jags and Lexus. But this thing is so much more than the sum of its parts. 

Being an automatic shift - and a very good automatic (it uses a modified 500SL 'box)- it tends to flatter your driving, as you usually find yourself in the right gear - and it downshifts better than I do. 
The kick that this thing has is truly unbelievable. Again - I compare to the 911, and this feels faster. 

Practically, my son loves it (he can see out of the window) - and my daughter probably will too (she's too young to opine at present).

The quality of fixture, fitting, and finish is absolutely top notch. The upholstery has that matt finish that Mercedes leather always has, and a year later - it still looks new. 

The C43 is different to the 'normal' C class in a number of ways. Under the skin, AMG take the 4.3 litre V8 seen in E Classes, S Classes, and M Class vehicles, tune and tamper with the cylinder heads, add 16 platinum-tipped spark plugs (thankfully they have a 100,000 mile warranty - they cost over $25 each to replace!) to make it produce 305 bhp. They then mate this to the aforementioned strengthened 500SL 5 speed gearbox. 
Moving under the car, they tune and lower the suspension, add 13inch fully floating vented front discs and 11 inch rears, and place the resultant chassis on 17 inch monoblock wheels. The exhaust system is custom built, culminating in twin chrome tailpipes. Heaven knows how much  that'll cost to replace!
Externally, a curvy bodykit is added, consisting of a front spoiler with foglamps and brake vents, side skirts and a rear underbody spoiler. The black/silver leather trim is another C43 feature - although a single tone black leather is available as is a duotone black/blue. The front seats are replaced with fully powered sports units, including power 2 stage lumbar support, and adjustable side bolsters. These seats are fun enough without even driving!
The C43 replaced the old AMG C36, which was a similar idea, but used a 3.6 litre straight six, and had a different bodykit.

My particular car has the 'Sport' trim (I insisted that the dealer remove the 'Sport' badge from the flank. What this translates to is that instead of plastic inserts painted to look like wood, it has plastic inserts painted to look like carbon fibre. The same effect is used on the C pillars. I can't say I like this much, but then I don't really dislike it either. I've not seen any US models with this trim - maybe it's Europe-only - but then they only made 1500 C43s worldwide in 1999, so perhaps you just don't see many of them fullstop. I've certainly never seen another one outside of a dealership.

The justification for the exorbitant cost price is not the bodywork or interior - either of which can be specified on regular C classes, but the engineering on the motor and chassis. The resultant sub 6 second 0-60 time and electronically limited top speed of 155mph speak for themselves.

Therefore, it has a very subtle, stealthy image - only attracting attention from true enthusiasts - and is fantastically secure. It really feels like a safe drive, both passively (airbags all over it, crumple zones, blah blah), and actively (very surefooted).

I also told my wife that the car would be relatively economical (again, compared to the 911s, where a $2000 service was the norm...)
The C43 has a two year/usage-based service interval, and routine servicing starts at less than $200. 
It has a 30 year recovery warranty, and a two year factory warranty. 
It also shares many body parts with any C Class, so repair and insurance costs should be lower. (In the event, the insurance worked out the same in the UK, so no gain there).
I even thought I'd save money on tyres as opposed to the doughnuts on the 911s (In fact - the tyre sizes on the Benz are IDENTICAL - 205/40/17ZR Front and 245/40/17ZR Rear). 

Oh well... I do still think it will be cheaper long-term than any of my other cars have been.

Talking of other cars, after I've had my cars for a while, I like to find their one unique feature - the one feature I wish all cars had. Let me explain (these are very personal things, you understand)-

My BMW 325 had extendable underthigh support
Volvo T5R had a plastic clip on the windscreen for holding parking permits
Porsche 944S2 dash lights were selective
Saab 900 Turbo16 ï¿½ Recessed sills.
911 (964) had a little luminous dot painted on the inside door handles (invaluable in a dark garage).
911 (993) had a leather owners manual (q.v.)

And this Mercedes? Well it has that 305 bhp V8, it snarls, and hits 110 before your son can tell you to slow down. 

I hate to sound like an acolyte of Benz, but it really is the best car I've owned. 

I do, however, have two criticisms.

The owner's manual covers all models from the base C180 up. Now I don't want to be a snob, but this thing cost me 50,000. Pounds Sterling. And I think they could have produced a slightly nicer - and more focussed manual for it! I know they don't make a lot of these things, but the C43 seems to be treated as an afterthought here, and there's insufficient information regarding tyre pressures, technical specs, etc.

And the other pain is when you wash it. It has so many water traps (window trim, rubbing strips, skirts, fluting on mirrors, etc), that it is impossible to prevent water gathering and then dripping out later to leave unsightly marks (being black - every mark shows). Newer-designed cars seem to eliminate these traps.

Anyway, I've had it a year now and I can't even say I'm getting itchy feet yet.

Although I did recently test an E55 - and I saw a one-off C55 a week or so ago...
