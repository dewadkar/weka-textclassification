            Want a truly world class, exotic sports car?  Something with outstanding performance?  Something that will turn more heads than any Porsche, BMW or anything else short of a Ferrari?  Something that costs about the same as a good entry level luxury sedan?

Then look for a Mitsubishi 3000GT Spyder VR4.

Styling:  The outstanding thing about this car is that it was the first hardtop convertible made since the 1959 Ford Skyline.  That's right - hard top convertible.  With the push of one button, the entire top folds up and stores itself in the trunk in about 30 seconds.  It even has a glass rear window equipped with a defroster!  So you get the best of both worlds: the joy of a convertible with the warmth, safety and security of a hard top.  This is an exotic looking car, especially with the top down.  It's low, wide and very aggressive, with beautiful chrome wheels.  Pull up to a light, hit the button, drop the top, and watch evereyone's jaw drop as well.

Performance:  Hang on.  This bad boy has a twin turbo, twin intercooled, 3 litre V6 that pumps out 320 horsepower.  All wheel drive provides outstanding handling and superior launch capability. Coupled with the same-phase all wheel steering the VR4 provides unbelievable cornering, especially on off-ramps and on-ramps.  Performance tires and big brakes help finish the package.  The suspension is electronically controlled, giving you the option of a Tour setting, or a stiffer Sport setting for those real twisties.  Numbers?  0-60 in 5.7 seconds and top speed of 160 MPH.  It would be even faster but this is a heavy car, weighing in at just over 4000 pounds.  That's the cost of all that comfort and technology.

Interior:  This is a GT car, which means it does not sacrifice luxury in the name of performance.  Comfortable, power adjustable seats.  Power windows, locks.  Climate control.  210 Watt Infinity sound with 6-disc changer. It even has back seats, although my three year olds have trouble with leg room :)

Exclusivity:  Like to drive something unique?  Only 1,034 Spyders were ever made, and not all were the twin turbo model.  They were made by Mitsubishi, but shipped to ASC who did the convertible conversion.  These cars were only made in 95 and 96. This is truly a rare car.

Cost:  When new, you could easily pay $65,000 or more.  Now you can get one in good shape, with around 40,000 miles for mid-30k$.  But it might take a while to find one - look on autotrader.com or ebay.  BTW, expect this to be a fairly expensive car to maintain.  It is loaded with high tech, and that stuff can be expensive.  Luckily, there were a lot of 3000gtVR4s made - just the Spyders are really exclusive.  So the only hard part is the top, which must be serviced by a factory trained mechanic who has special diagnostic computer equipment.  You may want to check with the Mitsu dealers in your area to see if they still have someone capable, or you may be driving your car a long distance to get the top serviced, should you ever need it.

Bottom Line: This is a rare, fast, exotic looking sports car that is relatively affordable when compared with anything else that performs or looks as good.
