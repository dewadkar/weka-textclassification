            Im thinking of renting Dodge Viper or buying but I love but I hate it since it lacks for we older types: a Auto Trans or Porsche style Tiptronic trans since my coordination is Bad.
Otherwise Id buy it ( for NV , not for CA use: Insurance. No I have never driven this car and any Single guy or girl who likes Speed should buy this It looks Fast vs a 99 Vette. I love its looks but to pricy for the average Joe driver But Id never buy this or similar car in RED.
Colors Id buy this in: Green, Silver, Blue, Turquoise, Salsa Red,
Pasta sauce red, Mint green, Gold, blended colors.
Please Dodge add an AT option to car, even Prowler.
