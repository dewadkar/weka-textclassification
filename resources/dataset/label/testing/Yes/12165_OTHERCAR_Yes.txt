            My mom now has our third Capri. It is a red 1994 with the removable hard top. It is one of the best cars we have had. We first got a White 1991 automatic with hard top new from a local dealership. About a year or so later we decided to trade it in for a red 91 with a five speed and kept the hard top having it repainted to match the paint of the red car. The auto is very good in this car but if you enjoy driving a stick, the five speed is incredible. In 1994 my mom decided to get a new one and decided to get a new Capri and my sister got the 91 and my mom traded in my sister's car for the new Capri. My sister had the car until a little over a year ago when she decided to trade it in on a new car because she wanted something with a little more room. When she traded it in the car had close to 140,000 and had had almost no major repair work done on it except the typical upkeep. The 94 Capri which my mom has, has about 150,000 and the only major repair that it has had is the air conditioning compressor had to be replaced. Other than that it has only had standard maintenance. The car gets about 30mpg and the engine has more than enough power. the five speed transmission is very well matched with the 1.6L 16 valve DOHC Mazda engine that the car has. the front seats are very comfortable and all of the controls are very well laid out. Mercury claimed that the seating was 2+2, two in front, two in back. There is about enough space in the back seat for a few bags of groceries. This car is very much a two seater. This is a car for someone that wants to have fun and is a very good bargain for what you get.<br><br>
