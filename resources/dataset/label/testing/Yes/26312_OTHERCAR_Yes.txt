            The 2000 Honda EX Coupe is worth the money overall. I drive the car rough sometimes but I have had no problems mechanically in the year and a half I have had the car.
The positives include good gas mileage. I have a heavy foot on the gas pedal but still get 30 miles per gallon. 
There are six speakers in the EX coupe including two tweeters on the doors. The overall sound system is decently loud. If you want something people can here from a block away you're going to have to add some bass. When the music is turned all the way up the sound is still clear. The only negative is that the cd player is not one of the best. It tends to skip more than other car CD players.
This car is not great for people living in a snow belt. If you want something that handles well in the snow get a Subaru. The car is too light to get good traction in the snow. I add weight in the trunk every year to get a little more traction but I can still feel the car sliding and slipping.
