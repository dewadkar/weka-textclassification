                It was quite a shock to realize our compact car was too small for all the friends our son has. 
    We bought our Venture because you never have just one child( as we do), he or she always has a few friends that need rides, carpooling to baseball games, class fieldtrips, etc... We definitely needed a larger vehicle. Moms, you will appreciate the seven seats the Venture has( models vary according to what you want of course).There is plenty of trunk space left over for the groceries or gym equipment or sleeping bags and tents. We went with the extended cab for this reason. 
    We tested all the minivans that were out at the time and found the Chevy had a more comfortable ride and roomier interior. The look of the exterior isn't so bad either. The Venture comes in a rage of colors and has many luxuries if you ant them. The price was a little more expensive but Chevrolets are well built and worth every extra penny.
    Two thumbs up for the 1998 Chevy Venture. Good job.    <br><br>
