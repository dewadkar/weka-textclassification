            "awesome" - if I had to describe the 2002 Mustang in one word that would surely be it!

The 2001 Eclipse Spyder Convertible I rented 6 months prior was very nice and had a slightly better build quality, but the general image and feel of the Mustang definately made it a winner in my heart.

Driving the Mustang is a pleasurable experience as the car drives like a dream, demands a lot of attention (especially in yellow) and all the gadgets and dials are present and correct.  

On the subject of gadgets this car has it all - Leather interior; ABS; Traction Control; Power windows/mirrors/hood; Air Conditioning; 6-disc CD player etc.  Best of all the gadgets - Two cup holders (one for a large McDonalds/Burger King beverage and one for a can of coke).  All in all the aforementioned makes the Mustang a very good "value for money" motor and puts it in direct competition with high-end convertible Chevys, Pontiacs and their Japanese counterparts. 

The 3.8 litre engine is no slogger, being very responsive and torquey low down in the rev range.  The only thing that could be improved is the "kick-down".  Although the car pulls ok I am sure it could be a bit quicker (for the likes of overtaking quickly on Interstate 4).  I drive a reasonably powerful and good handling car back home, but rest assured if I lived in the States I could comfortably trade it in the Mustang - it's that good!

I suppose the only 'cons' would be: 

a) the fuel consumption of about 20mpg - but at 22p per litre I would't worry too much.

b) the hassle of raising and lowering the convertible roof - When raising the roof I found the hooks didn't line up with the clips properly.  I had to yank the roof over a bit to clip it in place.  This may be as the car was brand spanking new.

c) Rear leg room - but that's to be accepted and expected in a car of this nature.

On a final note - if you would like to view pictures I took of my car (the red one), the Mustang (the yellow one) and the Eclipse Spyder (the silver one) I rented surf over to http://www.tsutton.f2s.com

Yours truly,

Terry Sutton.
