            After driving a SUV for a couple of years I decided to make a change and purchase a car. As many people may know SUV's are not the most reliable vehicle which is why my Chevy spent more time in the shop than on the road. Since I did not want to make the same error twice I did the research on what car people found most reliable but also appealing. After I read numerous reviews and specs I knew I wanted an Acura CL 3.0.

It was love at first sight! The Acura CL 3.0 is a sporty V6 coupe. I purchased a 1998 model without the premium package. I bought the car used with 30K miles; however it was like brand new. The Carribean blue paint is a beautiful and unique color that is a head turner. The car also came with a spoiler that adds a touch of style to the slanted trunk.

The inside is where the car varies from all of the others in its class. The tan cloth interior is average. It matches the wood grain dash very nicely but the quality of the interior cloth is not that great. The CL models come stock with a Bose stereo system, sliding moonroof, power windows and doors and a power drivers seat. The only downside to the model I have is that it did not come with leather. The premium package is an upgraded model that has luxurious leather seats as well as seat warmers. The back seat is roomy and the middle section will fold down for more room for items such as skis. The car also has a center console that will accommodate six CD's and has two cup holders. 

The Acura CL 3.0 definitely has power. The V6 engine coupled by a strong transmission will impress any driver. The car can take turns at a pretty fast speed. After driving an SUV for several years, I must say this car is fun to drive! If you want a fast, attractive car for a reasonable price get an Acura CL.
