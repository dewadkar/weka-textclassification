            My wife and I bought this car used a few months ago with, 73,000 miles on it. The dealer we bought it from included an 18/18 all inclusive warranty with the car, definitely a selling point for a used vehicle. We had the car three weeks and the water pump went out, fortunately we were only about 15 miles from home. If you do purchase a used Intrepid make sure to to try and cover yourself on the water pump, this is a common problem. Other than the water pump I have no complaints, so far this has been a great car, very comfortable, quick, excellent handling. This was a great mix for my wife and I...she wanted a family car, I wanted a sports car..we got BOTH! We have an 8 year old son and several younger nieces and nephews, the built in child seat is very handy when traveling with kids, a lot more convenient than lugging one around. The car is great looking, ours is teal and shines like brand new when we clean it. I love the seats big, firm, comfortable, a great car to take a trip in. I have heard some people complain about the AC in these cars, but you could store frozen foods in ours with the AC on. I haven't had the car long but so far I love it. Don't forget, the dealer makes a difference to, used cars are bound to have a few problems, it's whether or not you can get the problem fixed easily that makes the difference. You can also do a title history on a car by VIN, checkout Carfax.com, be informed!<br><br>
