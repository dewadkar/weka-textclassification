            I've been using the FD-71 camera now for about 2 years. Im in the Navy on Submarines and the ship needed a good quality Digital camera for use with our training program. We purchased the FD-71 based on my prior use of it at my previous duty. And it has been a very durable high quality addition to the ships equipment. The camera is used in many areas from taking pictures of equipment to show problems that are e-mailed to engineers to providing pictures for use in power point training. It is very versatile and I have never had a problem with the camera not being able to focus on any subject. The cameras menu system is easy to use and I have not seen one person not be able to pick it up and take a picture. The ability to review your picture to ensure its what you want is great. You can take the picture look at it while your still set-up! No waiting to download and see what you got. This is a real time saver. It does have a light sensor and sometimes the flash will go off when you dont need it. (I have found that most of the time this camera takes better pictures with out the flash) The flash tends to bleach out the subject. I recommend turning the flash off. Durability is outstanding as I stated being on a submarine I can tell you this product has been tested in an extreme setting. Its has been dropped various times from different heights and splashed with salt water and hydraulic oil. It is used continuously and to this day it provides very high quality pictures. The only real problem has been that the battery seems to be dying as it does not hold a charge very long. But this has been after almost 2 years of use and an unknown amount of battery cycles. We have had to purchase a new battery (Cost about 60.00)I would recommend this to anyone looking for a digital camera with good quality pictures and a durable camera<br><br>
