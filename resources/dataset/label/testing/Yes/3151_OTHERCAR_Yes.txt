            I bought my 2000 Hyundai Elantra after researching on various internet sites the pros and cons of different new autos that cost under $15,000.  I was looking for a vehicle that gave a smooth, fairly quiet ride, had comfortable seating for 5 people, automatic transmission and air conditioning.  At the time I had a 13 year old Toyota Camry with 208,000 miles, so I originally looked at the Toyota line.  I considered a Toyota Corolla due to price, but found the back seat to be too cramped for even my 12 year old daughter to sit in comfortably and all the features I wanted were extra. The Elantra on the other hand had plenty of leg room in the rear and included a lot more standard features for less money and compared favorably to my Camry in its younger days. Its safety record, which I checked out on internet auto sites was also very acceptable for its size class.  Best of all the rebates offered were good and the warranty couldn't be matched by even more expensive cars.  I've now had the car for two months with no problems.  If you can't afford a luxury car, want some comfort features standard, are interested in a great value, and desire the security of an extra long warranty (6 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper and 10 year 100,000 mile power-train) you should consider buying a Hyundai Elantra.<br><br>
