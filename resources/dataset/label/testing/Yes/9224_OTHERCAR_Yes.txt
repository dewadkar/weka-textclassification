            This is about how a little big car made me change my mind and finally feel really good about our choice to get a Honda CR-V ... (for my wife)

<b>Why a small SUV?</b>

It may have to do with my German heritage or simply overdeveloped pragmatism, but SUV's were somewhat off my radar screen due to their 'gas-guzzling' nature.

Getting married changed that, and we finally got to the point where my wife's 10-year old car simply didn't cut it anymore. After a few arguments the SUV became more and more attractive, mainly due to the smaller sized SUV class in which the CR-V holds the crown for 3 years straight now.

Anyway, not only have I been convinced by my 'better half' but also turned into a (semi-)believer. After all, <a href="/content_39031508612">my car</a> wasn't the most suitable vehicle for hauling any kind of load bigger than a suitcase.


<b>EX = Top of the (CR-V) line.</b>

The EX is virtually identical to the LX with a few exceptions in pre-installed options. The remote entry system can be found only in the EX model and realistically should be standard for any line in 2004. (Option for the others)

One feature sported by the EX model only is the <b>power moon roof</b>. It gives a little bit of freedom and allows sun and fresh air to enter 2 different ways. It tilts open and also fully retracts. Nice touch is the pinch-proof controls which stops the roof before smashing fingers. However, it would be nice if it also automatically closed upon locking the car when parking. Unfortunately it doesn't and rain may have it easy to enter being as forgetful as I am.

The <b>6 CD changer</b> combined with a <b>6 speaker</b> system also only comes with the EX model and is a nice touch and of good quality. Audiophiles, however, may crave more and will be faced with a non-DIN sized device that makes it harder to find a fitting replacement or requires an additional cover. The radio does not seem to be XMReady and requires an additional stand-alone tuner.

The EX leaves the factory 'safer' than the other models and offers <b>front side airbags</b>. While I hope we will never get to actually use them, it's a nice thought to have them. Also within the roam of added safety is the anti-lock braking system (ABS). Frankly this really should be standard and is one of the main reasons why we chose the EX since it's not available for the other 2 models.

The other differences are more of cosmetic nature. The 15" <b>alloy wheels</b> have 5 double spokes and -- despite being a little small for an SUV -- look good on the CR-V. Body-colored <b>mirrors</b> and rear <b>privacy glass</b> are the only other obvious features that set the EX apart from the rest of the line.

Most of these features, however, are available as <b>accessories</b> for the other two models as well with exception of the ABS, sound system, and the body colored mirrors.


<b>Attractive Exterior</b>

Since its makeover in <b>2002</b>, the CR-V looks more grown-up than its predecessor and styling may be nothing outrageous but very much fits into our times. In fact, its main treat is the absence of very timed flashy design elements that are 'cool' upon release and turn old soon after.

Though not changed over the last <b>3 years</b> (counting 2004 as a year), compared to the previous model, the 2004 CR-V is more square yet refined in its appearance and slightly bigger (inside and out). The most obvious changes in the rear are the removed body shoulder and relocated tail lights.

The <b>front</b> is bulkier and more modern looking than its predecessor. It also sports a lot of black plastic which is mainly in form of the oversized sculpted bumpers. Not as much as the Element but sure in line with the recent development. In fact, the CR-V manages this way to break up the big panels into smaller more attractive ones which helps the overall appearance of the car, err I mean SUV.

The available exterior <b>colors</b> are mostly mainstream (another Honda typical). We liked the Mojave, Blue and Red (Burgundy) the most. The 'pearl' effect is nicely pronounced for the CR-V line. 


<b>Functional Interior</b>

While there is no leather interior available for any CR-V model, the fabric still manages to make passenger feel at home. The 'pleather' accents of the <b>seats</b> boost the otherwise average look slightly. Seats are both firm and comfortable. In lieu of a center console, each seat has a small arm rest attached to it -- functional and unobtrusive, but not the most comfortable ever. Other than that there is little to complain about the seats. Some drivers might prefer a more tilted foot rest for the driver than the one at floor level.

Since we chose the <b>red exterior</b>, the only option for the interior color is Saddle which is a mix of tan and brown. After initial mixed feelings about a dark tan interior, it grew on me and now I am joining my wife in enjoying it. Sure, not the flashiest choice but quite livable. Apparently to keep cost down, Honda offers only one interior per exterior and the only choices are saddle or black. No leather seats are available.

The <b>instruments</b> and dash board are well organized and esthetically pleasing. Honda disseminates information on a need-to-know basis, means information overflow is one thing the driver doesn't have to be concerned about. However, some more modern-day information would be a nice touch. I am specifically missing EPA and outside temperature (incl. Ice Warning). And while we're at it, how about a temperature automatic for the cabin?

The <b>console</b> is simple and well defined with the radio/cd at the highest point and controls underneath the CD storage. Having the entertainment unit up that high makes actually a lot of sense safety wise, since the road stays somewhat in the field of view. The controls consist of 3 similar shaped rotary switches. Their function is very intuitive and easy to navigate.

The CR-Vs inside is all about function and <b>space</b>. No hindering console or brake between the seats and certainly a big trunk when folding the rear seat over. This is one of the most useful innovations in the CR-V since the seats don't only fold down but also fold completely out of the way for maximum cargo space.

The chosen <b>materials</b> are divided into 2 categories: (a) those that are of high quality and (b) those that look cheap but are still of very good quality. I think my main issue is with the chosen surface patterns for door panels and the console. PLASTIC is written in big letters on those. I guess I kind of prefer the faux leather look of the other parts.

Since <b>my wife</b> is the main driver of this vehicle, it may be noted that she especially likes the mirrors for both driver and passenger (in the front row) as well as the 5 storage places and the center tray that can be folded out of the way.


<b>Efficient Engine and smooth drive train</b>

Who says a <b>4-cylinder</b> engine cannot be smooth? Well, the CR-V's 2.4L VTEC is quiet and smooth under normal operation. In fact, I was surprised how quiet the ride is in normal city driving and especially on the interstate. The Civic based chassis may be the reason for it.

The <b>160 HP</b> don't sound like a whole lot and for sure is not enough to make this Sport-Cute a race car. However, despite the seemingly underpowered engine, the LEV-II motor does a good job in moving the CR-V to 60 in under 9 seconds. The available 162 ft-lbf of torque deal well with the 3,300 lbs of weight (add passengers). Towing may be a whole different ball game but we currently don't expect to need that anyway.

The 5-gear automatic <b>transmission</b> consists of 3 forward gears, 1 over-drive and 1 reverse. The shifting happens very smoothly and at no point seems abrupt. The overdrive can be disabled for steep hills and towing situations. The shifter is placed somewhat unconventional on the dash board but very likeable since it doesn't clutter the steering column.

The <b>AWD</b> (all wheel drive) watches the differential speed between the front and rear wheels to detect slipping and directs power to the rear wheels when needed -- without any interaction with the driver. Great feature in Winter as long as one remembers that 4x4 can go faster on a slippery road but stopping doesn't get advantage over 2 wheel driven vehicles.

<b>Efficiency</b> of a any truck sized vehicle is worse than a good car due to greater weight and resistance. The CR-V doesn't break this rule either. However, with 20 - 26 MPG it is one of the most efficient SUV's on the road. We currently manage 19 MPG in pure city driving -- maybe a function of the cold weather? In fact, I like Honda's philosophy in this regard ... why carry around several hundred extra horses if all they do -- most of the time -- is feeding. ;-) Of course one might question this rationale when looking at <a href="/content_39031508612">my car</a> ...


<b>In a nut shell</b>

The CR-V didn't win the top rank in its class several years in a row for nothing. It's a well built and good designed little SUV. A size that should be sufficient for most families. A good compromise between the bigger gas-guzzling vehicles and the smaller, more fuel-efficient sedans.

Honda follows its company philosophy of a 'minimalistic' design and with focus on usability and efficiency. In this area the CR-V does very well regarding ergonomics and a clean user-machine interface. Not the most attractive I've ever seen, but one of the most efficient ones. In fact, within its class I didn't come across a better solution.

The CR-V might as well be the best SUV for the money. Dealers know that and it is currently very hard to get better deals for both used and new CR-Vs. That helps to retain value but makes it harder to get one.

<b>Update (27-Jan-2004):</b>

It's the 3rd day of driving in actual snow and ice. (First time this Winter in NC!) So far the AWD does an excellent job and engages very transparently when needed. The combination of Bridgestone tires, real-time AWD and the CR-Vs handling make it a great proposition for driving in this kind of weather.
