               I've driven this car for around 13 years, since my parents bought it new in 1990.  I bought it from them in 1995 with 69,000 miles, and currently it has over 101,000 miles.  Up until I bought it, it was doing hard duty in a Los Angeles suburb, but has since spent most of it's time on long highway drives out in New Mexico.  

   The only things requiring major service have been the timing belt, which lasted 69,000 miles (9,000 miles longer than replacement interval), and the clutch, which lasted around 90,000 miles.  The only time I actually broke down at the side of a road was when the clutch finally died, after weeks of audible and tactile warning.

   Though it's by no means a sports car, it handles accurately and predictably even if you try to drive it like one.  Its rated 80 horsepower won't exactly give you whiplash, but handles freeway merging and most hills quite nicely.  The 1.8 liter Fox does get about 26 miles per gallon on the highway, giving you about a 300 mile range with its 12.5 gallon gas tank.  The '90 Foxes came only with a 4-speed manual transmission, which makes the engine run pretty loud at highway speeds.  The wagons received an Analog clock instead of a tachometer for some unknown reason.  They did include a nice coolant temperature gauge, however. 

The GL models have fairly nice seat fabric, and the driving position is quite comfortable.  The quality of the interior is generally weak, however.  The seat tilt is adjusted by turning a large knob; it works, but it's clumsy.  The sun visors, glove compartment, door pockets, and instrument light dimmer, and side view mirrors on my Fox are all usable but broken in some way.  However, none of the really critical interior components, such as the light switches, speedometer, door handles and such, have had any problems.  Back seat room is minimally adequate for adults on short trips.  The wagon does, of course, have plenty of cargo space; more so with the back seat folded down.
