            I researched digital cameras for 5 months before deciding to purchase the mavica 83 and did alot of price comparison. I bought the camera for $500 although it sells for much more but it is being discontinued so get it while you can, there are few left out there. 

The down side of owning this camera is: it is clunky, there is no cover for the lcd (but you can buy them through mavican.com), it doesn't come with a camera case, and the mpeg movie mode feature is not good quality at all. For the movies , sony recommends saving the movie to your hard drive and then watching it rather than playing it directly from the 3.5 but the picture is still distorted.

 I have used the mavica 73 also, and I must say that compared to the 83, the pictures are far better. the 73 takes good pictures for the money, but there are lot of jaggies and you must have good lighting for your pictures to look nice. As for the 83, pictures look great all the time. Although there are a few things I think sony could have done to improve this camera, the pros far outweigh the cons. This camera has a 2.5 lcd, essential for seeing exactly how your pictures look. It has in camera editing. And you can pull up thumb nail images of all your pictures at once. It is so so easy to use!! I guess what sold me on this was that the camera came complete. you don't have to worry about buying batteries and chargers, and all the extras. With this camera you get one rechargeable battery and don't have to use AA's which I've read only usually last 50 pictures on other digital cameras before they have to be replaced. Unless you are a professional photographer, i highly recommend this camera.<br><br>
