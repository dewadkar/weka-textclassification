            Not many weeks ago, I was offered a TT Roadster for the day by my local Audi dealership, who by the way are nice people who value customers. Anyone with even a vivid interest in cars cannot have overlooked the TT for its phenomenal styling alone. The car looks great, as if the styling gurus had for more of a say than the guys at engineering. The design is radical, but still reminiscent of the Beetle, an icon of Audi's parent company. 

As you get in, the most striking feature is the size of the windows. You feel like you're in a pillbox, waiting to gun down some trespassers. The quality of the interior is as excellent as anywhere this side of a Bentley. Audi provides supportive and comfortable seats from which you're supposed to have fun. I would absolutely recommend getting the BOSE sound system, unless the engine noise is all you like to listen to.

The engine is a 1.8 litre four-pot. Doesn't sound like a powerful thing really. However, Audi's four-pot has five valves for every cylinder, and puts a nice turbocharger on top. The result, in my test case, was 225 rather beefy horses. This is a car which bashes out 202 lb ft of torque as low as 2200 rpm, resulting in decent pace no matter which of the six gears you may be in.

The roof is not completely automatic, as you might find in a BMW 3-series. It involves the turning of a handle, after which buttons and motors do the rest. Trying not to sound discriminatory, this is a car that is so easy to use that even women will enjoy it. Everything is neatly planned and detailed, the car doesn't require much technincal know-how to operate, and the electronically operated glass wind deflector is a stroke of genius.

Sadly, during the first year, the TT had several serious accidents on the autobahn and other places. These were the results of high-speed oversteer, which Audi corrected with new suspension settings and a boot-lid spoiler. Unfortunately, whilst I can understand the aerodynamic necessity of the spoiler, the new suspension settings have made an impact on how fun the car is to drive. It is fine around town (except for a slightly heavy clutch), and excellent on the open road. It is when you try to explore its limits as a sports car where disappointment first rears its ugly head. The main handling characteristic is understeer. This is fine and safe for your average driver, or newly baked, wealthy drivers.
However not newly baked (hey, I'm 19) drivers, who use the car as more than transport, the lack of classic rear-wheel powerslides can be a bit dull. The nice thing is that car communicates well when the front wheels are about to slip, and Audi's excellent ESP will only brake with the rear wheels when you're going off the road, allowing the fronts the maximum friction to steer. Don't get me wrong, this car can be used for hooliganism on the road, but when you throw that rear end out by weight-shifting, the front end will follow, in a scary four-wheel powerslide. As a contrast, I recommend a Honda S2000 for tail-happy antics, or even a TVR Chimaera 4.0 (quick as hell, dodgy build).

Still, the Audi earns my respect for what it is. A motor car in which one will be seen as fashionable, creative, and successful. A motor car that is as safe and reliable as a VW Golf (which shares its platform) and a true object of beauty.<br><br>
