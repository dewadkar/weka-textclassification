            I test drove every sporty convertible out there when looking for a car recently.  OK, every <i>affordable</i> convertible.  I kept my search under $45,000.   I skipped a few - the Sebring is not 'sporty' enough, and the Honda 2000 and new Celica Spyder are very hard to get, so I didn't bother.

<b>V6   200 horse</b>
I went for the GT.  That V6 is so smooth.  And it purrrrs.  I'm not a car guy.  Don't know anything about the engine, just know when to change the oil.  And I don't want to know anything about it.  I just want to have fun.   My wife's car is an Eagle Talon AWD with Turbo.  It's 210hp, but it's turbo.  I used to like the feel of the turbo kicking in, giving you a nice power surge.  It's what got me craving power.  But once I tried the V6 here, I now like the instant response.

<b>Automatic / Clutchless Manual</b>
It's an automatic, which for me is a necessity.  I know everyone says that a sports car must be a standard, but my feeling is that when someone invents something (automatic transmission) to make my life easier, I use it.  After all, I don't manually change the channels on my TV, I use a remote.  :)    Seriously though, I like to have a cup of coffee now and then, and I also find myself in traffic in the NY area, so I find standard a pain in the neck.  And... I can always <i>switch</i> to manual.  I simply move the stick to the right, and I'm in manual, able to control when the car shifts.  

This is great when on the highway and it's time to pass someone.  I just pop it down to a lower gear and fly around them.  Is it as responsive as a full manual?  Probably not, but who cares?  I'm having fun.  When I want to 'play' sports car, I can stay in manual.  When I just want to relax and enjoy, I stay in auto.  Best of both worlds.  Oh, and the car downshifts automatically in manual, which is good for us 'lazy' shifters.  :)

<b>Fun Factor</b>
Did someone say fun?  If you've been dreaming about a convertible, then this is the one for you.  It's affordable - under $30,000 (note, it goes for sticker price because of demand) and rides well.   And I feel guilty driving a car like this with the top up, so unless it's raining, the top is always down.  If it's chilly out, I've got the heat cranking.  If it's hot and humid, the AC helps to keep the sticky mugginess out of the cockpit.

<b>Comparisons</b>
There are two types of convertibles to compare to.  The roadsters like the Z3 and Miata, and the sedans like the 325 and Mustang.   The roadsters were a bit too small for me.  The Z3 rides REAL nice, and it's quiet, but there is just no room in it.  The trunk is a glove compartment.  The Miata is just a shadow of the Z3.  It's nice and sporty, but it's a little tinny.  It just doesn't feel solid, and it's a bit noisier of a ride.  And a little cramp for a 6 foot driver.

The BMW 325, I know, has fans.  It looks real sharp. It's a classy looking car, and it drives nice.  But it didn't have enough pep for me.  I don't know why, it's supposed to be a performance type car, but it just didn't do it for me.  The Mustang had pep.  It's got room, a nice back seat and good size trunk considering that part of the trunk has to shared with the retracted roof.  The newer model Mustang doesn't look as Beefy as last years model.  For some reason, don't know why, the old model Mustang looked too much like a muscle car.  It looked real nice, but I just couldn't get past that it looks like something to be cruising High School parking lots with... not something a thirty-something cares much about.  :)  The new stylings though have toned down the look a bit, and I was leaning towards the Mustang - though not the 5.0, I didn't want the extra insurance headache.

After leaving the Ford dealership, I thought I was going to go with the Mustang as I headed for the Mitsubishi dealer.  One last car to look at... the Spyder.   The stylings changed a bit from the Eclipse of 1999.  It's not as curved.  It seems to be a hybrid of the Eclipse and the 3000GT.  Not what I was expecting, but I give it a test drive.  Sold.  One test drive.  OK.  Two.  I first tried the GS (V4) and liked it, but then decided to try the GT.  Goodbye Mustang.   

The Spyder is a fantastic ride.  With the top down, there is less wind than the other vehicles.  Probably has something to do with the slope of the windshield.  The wind just seems to flow right over you.   The seats are comfortable, the back seat is adequate, with plenty of leg room if a short person is up front.  No one supposed to ride in the back anyway.  ;)  The stereo sounds good, even with the top down.  Of course, to hear it better you might want to roll the windows up - that seems to keep the sound in a little better.

<b>minors negatives</b>
Very minor.  The gas cap.... it looks sharp, but it's plastic.  Cheap plastic.  With such a nice looking car, you'd think they'd make the gas cap cover look a little less chintzy.  And, <i>it doesn't lock.</i>  I guess the designers got a bad tip that gas prices were coming down and we don't have to worry about someone siphoning gas?  Or worse, tampering with our tank?

Only other negative, so far, which isn't really a negative unless you weren't expecting it....  Premium Gas Only.  With gas going for $2 now, that just adds to the expense of this car.  But that would be the case with any performance car anyway.

<b>Advice</b>
Don't test drive this car unless you are ready to buy.  Otherwise you will just keep wishing you were in it.


Comparing it to the BMW Z3, it's not as sporty or flashy, but it's got more room.  To the Miata, well, let's just say the Miata looks cool, but it's kind of a toy.  And again, small.
