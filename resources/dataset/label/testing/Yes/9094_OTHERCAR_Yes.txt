            Kia's were first recommeded to me by a coworker, she and her husband were looking to buying one and since I was in need of a new vehicle, in a hurry, I started checking them out.  My main concerns were centered around the four wheel drive ability and the seeming lack of ground clearance.  I researched some online, and decide to actually go and drive one.  I ended up driving a 1999 Sportage 4 door with 4wd.  I loved it!  It handles great, the ground clearance has not been a problem and despite having our first snowstorm of the season I'm getting around great.  If you're looking for an SUV that is actually in your price range, check these out.  They are not as powerful as some of the larger vehicles such as the Durango, but so far it hasn't been an issue for me.<br><br>
