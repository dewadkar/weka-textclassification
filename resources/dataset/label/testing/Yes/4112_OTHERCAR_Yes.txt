            To start with, the '98 Nissan Pathfinder is a good solid bet in a midsize SUV.  We bought this Pathfinder XE (2WD)  in Southern Calif. in 1998 and we've never regretted owning it.  My only regret is that now that we live in the northeast and without the 4WD it has very poor traction in snow.

The strong points of the Pathfinder are its unitbody constuction, which provides a supple, yet taught ride, with literally no squeaks or rattles even over rough roads.  I love driving our Pathfinder into New York City, it has a great ride over Manhattan streets, potholes, metal plates and all.  The ride deteriorates somewhat when the vehicle is fully loaded with people or cargo. The chassis is coupled to a very strong V-6 engine that is quiet and smooth.  This SUV won't break any speed records though, as the horsepower is trying to move 4,000+ pounds.  Still, I found it has more than enough power to pass on 2-lane roads.  The fit and finish of the Pathfinder are excellent, as you would expect for a Japanese made vehicle.

Our Pathfinder is also very reliable.  In the 5 years and approx 50,000 miles, all repairs have probably totalled under $500.  The blower motor was squeaking, requiring replacement of the fan shroud ($85), it needed new front brake pads at 30,000 miles and it also needed all 4 tires by 40,000 miles.  

One comment on the air conditioning: If you live in a damp climate and keep the a/c on recycle, moisture can build up in the system and it starts to smell like dirty sweatsocks.  The dealer recommended using the a/c only on fresh air to reduce this problem.

There are some notable omissions on the 98 Pathfinder that might be appreciated: one is a carbon filter, since the fresh air intake is down low and if you are driving behind a diesel truck or bus or car you will breathe fumes through the ventilation system.  99 and later Nissan's have the filter and do not have this problem.  I also find the front seats uncomfortable on long trips.  There is not enough lumbar support or side bolster.  Otherwise, the driving position is good and all controls are within easy reach.

Another comment is that I don't like the placement of the rear door handles.  On any other car, kids can open the back doors, but the high location make it hard or impossible for kids to open the rear doors.  Reat seat comfort is OK for 2 adults, 3 would be tight for a long trip.  I can tell you that the interior of a minivan has way more space than a Pathfinder.   With a family of 4, I don't find that there is that much more cargo or interior space than in a Nissan Maxima.  Keep in mind when carrying kids- you can only take 2 kids in car seats since the front seat cannot be used for a child due to the airbag.  If you're driving/carpooling other children, you have very limited people capacity.

The Pathfinder is a rather wimpy cargo carrier.  With the rear seat up, there is not THAT much space, as compared to say a Ford Explorer or other midsized SUVs.  It is a pain to fold down the rear seat.  You must first remove both headrests, then flip the seat bottoms forward, then the back folds down.  If you are doing a lot of hauling, you're better off with a minivan.

The engine is coupled to a nice automatic trans with overdrive and it shifts well under most conditions.  Some Pathfinders have had some transmission problems in the past.  Antilock brakes work well in rain and snow although dry braking could be better.  The Pathfinder can easily cruise at 75-80 mph on the highway.   I like the cruise control, it makes long trips easier.  The sound system is good, although much better if you have the Bose stereo option.

If you're looking at a used SUV, the Nissan is a good bet, because it's reliability is much better than Ford or Jeep.   It has been a good vehicle to own, but since we do little/no offroad driving we will probably get a minivan for our next vehicle.
