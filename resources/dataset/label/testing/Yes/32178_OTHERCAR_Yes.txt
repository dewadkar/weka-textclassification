            I own a 1999 Chevy Cavalier LS, 4-door sedan. Other than one problem when it was initially purchased in December of '98 I have never had to have any work done on it, period. It gets wonderful gas mileage...I average around 33 miles to a gallon (that's highway/city combined driving). In a year, I have put about 25,000 miles on it from several trips made out of state and it still runs like brand new. I think Chevy cars have come a long way in recent years and the Cavalier is a perfect example of it. The Cavalier gives you far more for your money than any other car on the market in its class. It has standards like anti-lock brakes, traction control, and others that cost far more on others in its class, if even available. If you purchase on and have to finance it, going through GMAC works wonderful because they usually have great interest rates available. (Mine is 4.9%) Overall, it's a wonderful car and a wonderul value.<br><br>
