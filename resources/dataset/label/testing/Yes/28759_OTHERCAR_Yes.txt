              I absolutely love my 1998 Black Honda Prelude!  When I went car shopping, I looked at other cars such as the Ford Mustang, Chevy Camaro, Chrysler Sebring, etc, but the Prelude caught my eye!  I bought this car because it has great exterior styling and performs wonderfully.  I also like the interior of the car.  The dashboard and controls in the car are pleasing to the eye and simple to use.  
  The Prelude is an awesome performance car even though it has a 4 cylinder, 195 horsepower engine.  My Prelude has the DOHC VTEC engine that runs wonderfully and sounds great too.  The car has good pickup especially once you hit 3rd gear.  My car is equipped with the automatic sports shift which gives you the best of both worlds.  I drive back and forth to college everyday and I look forward to the drive because of the great handling of my Prelude.  
  This car is for medium to small framed people.  If you are rather tall, you may not have enough headroom and legroom.  I am a 5'8&quot; female and I have plenty of room.  The backseat is rather small, but hey it's a sports car not a sedan.  My friends do sit in the backseat with little discomfort.  I find the car a bit noisy at times because of the wind, but it doesn't bother me a bit.  I do live in  South Louisiana where it tends to be rather windy at times! 
  Honda offers a lost of extras standard such as anti-lock breaks, cruise control, a cd player and a window intergrated antenna. Other options include a sunroof and a spoiler which add to the car's exterior sporty look.  I've also added fog lights and a leather car bra to my Honda Prelude.  I get good gas mileage, about 28 miles to the gallon on the highway.  I believe that the price of the Prelude is reasonable, especially with the great performance, looks and reliability I have received.  <br><br>
