            My Sony MVC FD83 was a birthday gift in July. While stating over and over that I would love to have one, I certainly did not think my children were paying attention to me. Surprise!!  After the shock of it, I was scared to death of this camera. Being 61 years old, I do not like to have to study directions for a long period of time.  I am thinking I will never learn how to use this camera. WRONG...... The next morning I sat on my porch with the camera and information, I followed the easy steps and Bingo in less than a hour (seemed more like 10 minutes) I took my first picture of doe who loves to eat up my flowers.  The directions are very clear and  easy to understand. My camera goes where ever I go, I have wonderful pictures that I would have never had with a regular camera. My very favorite, is a shrimp boat coming thru a dense fog. BEAUTIFUL!! Buy for yourself and your loved ones. <br><br>
