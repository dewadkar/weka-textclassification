            I recently purchased a Canon D60 camera with 2 USM lenses.
The 28-80 EF USM and the 70-300EF USM.

The only edition that I will probably add is the 17-35 Tamron(due to the price) over the Canon lense.

The camera has a learning curve so if you think you can just run and use it to it full extent don't kid yourself.
Download the user manual and read it first. 

I ordered mine in May and it arrived in Sept.
I also as of yesterday purchased a Canon EOS ELAN 7E as my film camera. Uses all the same stuff except the battery.

I shot quite a few pictures in the last couple of weks and they are great.  But you must add a better flash for those darker pictures.
The 420ex works fine. Note I was talked into a sunpack unit the 4000 which had more power and was cheaper by the salesman who I have relied on for more than 30 yrs. But the unit didn't work it was TTL and the Canon EOS D60 uses ETTL only so it didn't work on that camera but it did work on the rebel series just fine. It would track the zoom but the unit would not fire in any mode including manual.
So take that into account you must use their flash as of this writing. The pc outlet worked fine with my standard candlestick Sunpack but even with the hot shoe adapter the flash wouldn't work.

I looked at and was going to the store to buy the FUJI S2 PRo when I was told mine had just arrived. The thing I do not like about the Fuji is the 2 battery style CR123a and 4 AA batteries. Also  reports were jaggies when items are 45 degrees.

The camera of course is big just like a real 35 mm SLR.
The Elan 7E is noticably lighter but the digital for most work is great.

Picture size in the jpeg format in the very best mode is about 1.5 meg average so be ready for using at least 128 meg cards.

And get the kit one with the battery charger etc.
All in all the camera is great and I feel it is better than the Fuji and the D100 as I use a N-80 Nikon at work and I am not really pleased with the number of times it misses the proper focus.
Good luck hope this review helps.
