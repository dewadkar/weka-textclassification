              We recently bought a 1998 S70 T5 used.  With the impending arrival of our second child, we realized we needed to find a replacement for our 2-door sports car.  We were looking for a sporty 4-door sedan, not willing to entirely succumb to the family image.  We were pretty set on buying a new car, and were looking at spending ~23k.  We were looking at the Saturn LS300, Nissan Maxima, Chrysler Sebring, and Dodge Intrepid.  The wife had always wanted a Volvo, but we realized they were beyond our price range, and I really didn't want what I assumed was the un-sporty Volvo.  We were leaning more towards the Nissan or Saturn, but to placate my wife we went to the Volvo dealership to look at what they might have.  Looking at their used cars we came upon a aqua blue T5.  It had a little over 47k miles on it, but was otherwise in near-new condition.  We were looking to trade in our '98 Saturn SC2 (a great car in it's own right), and it had similar mileage on it.
  I wasn't expecting much as I took the T5 for a test drive.  Boy was I surprised!!!  This car hauls a$$!!!
  I had the salesman holding on to the "oh-sh!t" handles as I put the car through its paces.  The 5 cylinder Turbo puts out 236 horses, the turbo kicks in at 2300 rpms like a rocket.  On the freeway, if you press down quickly on the accelerator it automatically kicks into the lower gear and the turbo kicks in, taking off!  It was easy to pass and get through the traffic.  This is where the power shines through.  The T5 isn't that quick off the line until the turbo kicks in, then you are thrown against your seat as the car takes off.  On the freeway, feel free to pass all the other cars out there with ease (even in Ca where the average speed is around 80mph).  This car handled and outperformed all the others we looked at.
  Being a Volvo, you know the car is safe.  I have since learned that Volvo stands for "I roll", and they are legendary for protecting the passengers.  Airbags are standard, as are many safety related items.  
  Although the luxury appointments in this car are rather spartan compared to others, it has plenty to make to passengers comfortable.  Leather seating, memory and heated seats are all optional.  The 6-speaker stereo puts out more than enough volume and clarity for me.  Roomy trunk, sliding sunroof, fold down seats.  The car makes long hauls easy.
  Although I would not have thought of owning a Volvo, I am ecstatic about this one.  Once I drove it, I was convinced.
  I only wish it was a bit more sporty looking, but it is fairly stylish in the Volvo way.
  I have not dealt with repairs yet, so I can't comment on cost.  Although it seems like the dealership may be the only repair option, and most parts will have to be purchased from them.  My insurance only went up $80 a year for the T5 from the Saturn SC2.
  Bottom line:  It is worth the cost, and an exciting ride!
