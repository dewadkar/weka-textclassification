              In charge of the newsletter for my church's college group, I was sick of wasting whole rolls of traditional film in order to process a few pictures that I needed for a deadline.  I needed a digital camera able to take high quality pictures, which could then be quickly transferred to computer without worrying about film processing.  I had previously tried a borrowed Sony Mavica (convenient for its use of 1.44 floppy disks) but was unsatisfied with the low 640x480 resolution it offered.
  After reading scores of reviews concerning the Kodak DC280 Zoom and the competition, I decided to take the plunge and purchase the digital camera.  The camera was very intuitive in its controls and I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening the box.
  The quality of the photographs is excellent, provided the picture is taken of a motionless object by a steady hand.  Any movement, whether by the target or the photographer of the picture, and the quality declines from excellent to great to good to blurry, relative to the degree of movement.  Zoom in, and the blurring effect caused by motion is multiplied significantly.
  The zoom on the camera is 2x optical and 3x digital.  I feel that Kodak would have produced a better camera by manufacturing the camera to 3x optical and 2x digital zoom.  The optical zoom works wonderfully, but once the digital zoom is employed, the pictures begin to look grainy and picture quality decreases.  The flash is wonderful for use indoors, but it does not fill adequately for low light outdoor usage.  The camera is able to take 3 pictures in quick succession before requiring a pause to write to the memory.
  The DC280 came with 4 alkaline batteries as well as 4 Ni-MH batteries with their charger.  I was initially concerned after seeing how quickly the alkaline batteries were drained.  However, the rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, betters suited for use in energy hungry electronic devices, provided great battery life for the camera.  On a negative note, if Kodak had included an AC adapter with the camera, instead of requiring the customer to purchase it separately for &gt;$30, it would have been extremely welcomed.  This would eliminate the battery usage when downloading pictures from the camera onto the computer.
  The camera comes with some extras, which can be used to add some simple flair to pictures.   Black &amp; White and Sepia effects as well as borders, which can be placed around the pictures, can enhance the mood of shots.  The USB connection is a wonderful feature that cuts the time downloading the pictures from camera to computers significantly from serial connection.
  I highly recommend this camera for individuals accustomed to the point-and-shoot, automatic cameras.  Kodak seems to have orientated this model towards the mainstream consumers, looking for an easy to use digital camera with excellent picture quality.  The resolution and picture quality is perfect for web pages and low-res publications.  Downloading pictures onto computer is easy with the bundled software and USB.  However, consumers desiring the control and power of a professional camera will be severely limited by the simplicity of the camera.  This digital camera is not intended for professional level publications in resolution or even file format (it can not save the pictures in an uncompressed format such as TIFF).
  Ultimately, the DC280 provides incredible quality in comparison to the competition within its price range.  The convenience of digital coupled with the excellence of its pictures make the Kodak DC280 Zoom a fantastic bargain.  Iï¿½ve found that it does the job nicely for the needs of our newsletter.<br><br>
