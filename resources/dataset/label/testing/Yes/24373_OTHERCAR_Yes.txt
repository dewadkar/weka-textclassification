               I bought this product about two months ago. I bought it because My family and I wanted a good Digital Camera that we could take pictures our friends and family members that are down here and then we wanted to send them to our friends and family in other parts of the country. We were planning on only spending about five hundred dollars on a camera because we thought we could get a good camera for that amount. We looked at eight different stores for a camera at the price we wanted but they we all junky. 

   One day I went to Best Buy and I saw the digital camera section. I walked in and saw the perfect camera. The Sony DSC-F55 was the nicest camera in the store. When I found out that the price of the camera was more then I wanted to spend, I didn't even care. I asked the sales people about the camera. They let me test it out. It was so amazing! There were so many features. I couldn't believe it and neither could my family. Now that we have it, we use it all the time.

   If you are looking for a tough, durable, and amazing camera, this is the camera for you. The Sony DSC-F55, don't forget the name!
