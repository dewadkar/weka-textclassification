            The Toyota Tacoma was my first choice in buying a new pick-up.  From past experience with Toyota cars and trucks, I knew that it was reliable and economical.  I was surprised when I started having problems with a heavy vibration in the drive train.  This was within the first five days of ownership.  I discovered that the drive shaft had been damaged prior to my taking delivery and was the primary source of the vibration.  The salesman and sales manager were not helpful in getting the needed repairs.  The Toyota hotline was next to worthless.  Finally, after getting the local better business bureau involved, the repair service manager had the drive shaft, U joints, six gears in the transmission, and two sets of bearings replaced.  Since those repairs were made, the pick-up has had no problems.  My wife is only 5'1&quot; tall and has a real problem depressing the clutch to start the vehicle.  The bench seat causes a person to effect a lean to the outside.  Three adults are a big squeeze getting into the front seat,<br><br>
