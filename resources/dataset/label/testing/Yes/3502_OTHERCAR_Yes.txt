            This MB can be the answer to the car lovers dream. Roomy interior, wonderful ride quality, nicely appointed interior. It feels like class every time you sit in it.
We bought ours new at the beginning of the '97 model year and were thrilled to have a truly quality automobile that lived up to the reputation of the Mercedes Badge. Our first trip of any consequence was from upstate New York to Georgia and it was delightful. Seats were multi adjustable for both drivers. Ride was smooth and quiet. When you got out of the car, after a day on the road, there was a definite appreciation of good your body felt. It does make a difference.
Good gas mileage, both city and on the road was a pleasant surprise. It was also nice to have a motor that was very responsive. I had forgotten how a powerful engine can give you a little thrill when you hard accelerate. It was fun to drive.
Complaints  are basically related to quality. Fine fit and finish were no problem. However, I did not think that the special, extra cost, seats with air bladders for all parts of your body should have needed replacement within a year or so because they developed creaks whenever a grown man accelerated the car. Also disturbed by having to replace an engine gasket that leaked oil. Even more serious was the failure of the transmission which also had to be replaced. Seems to me that a $50,000 car should be above all that. All was done under warranty, but still a pain in the neck.
Very much difference in dealerships. Two that we used were questionable. They were not sharp at diagnosing problems but two others were &quot;the best&quot;. Had loaner cars for us and couldn't have been nicer, even though we had not purchased the car from them. One , in fact, delivered a loaner to us, and picked up our car, a distance of over 100 miles, at no cost to us. Pretty classy.
Would I buy another?? Hard to say. We bought this one off lease after our three years were up, so I guess that we really like it. When replacement time comes, maybe a new MB, or I will seriously look at the BMW for a little sportier ride.
This assumes that I can tear it away from my wife. She adores the car and I don't blame her.
