            I've been using my Canon S10 for almost 6 months.  The camera was recommended to me by a friend and I have been having a lot of fun with it.  Apart from taking great pictures of memorable events with friends, it is also a great camera to take scenary pictures, action pictures and also taken panoramic pictures.  
The camera is very versatile, you can basically take it to anywhere you want, as it fits in pant's pockets very nicely.  It can also taken great pictures of pretty much anything you like.  The stiching program that comes with it allows you to stitch pictures together, therefore 360 degree view can be taken and quality is not affected.  
Several of the not so great things about the camera is the fact that the battery's life is very short.  Even though it is a small camera, it sucks the battery's juice out fast and if anybody does decided to buy this camera, it is highly suggested that an extra battery should be purchased, and preferably a rechargeable one.  The camera is fairly heavy in weight, therefore when it is in your pant's pocket, make sure you are wearing your belt, if you don't want your pants to fall off.  Lastly, due to the palm size S10, it suffers in the quality of pictures slightly.  Quality is still great, but S10 is not suitable for photographers who are looking for perfect quality pictures for professional use.  If you are looking for a camera for home use, then this is one of the best cameras there are.  
Canon did come out with the S100 as a replacement of the S10 a while ago, but from what i know, many people have criticized the poor quality of S100.  That is why I think the S10 is still one of the best cameras in the market.
