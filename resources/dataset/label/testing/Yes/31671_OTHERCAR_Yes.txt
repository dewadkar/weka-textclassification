              We bought a 1996 Chevy Lumina van about 18 months ago.  The van was a program car with low mileage.  Since we've had it, we've put an incredible 35,000 miles on it.  We call it our &quot;workhorse&quot; and it's served us pretty well.
   Positives are the gas mileage.  We still can get 25 mpg most of the time with it.  It also runs well and is extremely comfortable.  The seats have multiple configurations and we'll change them around depending on our needs.  We've had no maintenance issues in those 35,000 miles with the exception of ruining tires after running over a curb.  This was our fault but other than that the van's cost us nothing in repairs.
   The negatives for us are the handling.  The van seems to have a really wide turning radius.  It also a long hood which makes it a little difficult to park.  We also knew of course knew that it didn't have the second passenger door and I must say that's been more of an inconvenience than we thought it would be.
   Would I buy it again.  Yes.  For what we've put it through I think it's held up remarkably well.  It's a good, reliable family van.<br><br>
