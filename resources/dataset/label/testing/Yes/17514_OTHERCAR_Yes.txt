            A few years ago, I leased a BMW 328i.  I loved the car - here's the <a href="/auto-review-49FD-5DEC4A2-38F72EDA-prod1">old review </a>.  It was the perfect size for me and my then girlfriend.  Although the trunk was not huge, it was serviceable, and because it was a sedan model, it was more than enough room for 4 if we needed to go somewhere with another couple.  

It had one huge drawback, however.  It didn't like the winter up here in the Northeast.  Not even a little.  It was also sketchy in the rain.  In both cases, I found that using the traction control and the clutchless shifting made it a better proposition in the weather.  But honestly, there were times that I was just fish-tailing my way home, sweaty-faced and white-knuckled.  This past winter was especially hard (and I'm not sure its even over yet)!

Since buying a third car was not an option, I knew that I had to get a safer car.  Since we are trying to start a family, I knew the car needed to make my wife feel secure, and I was ready to have a less sporty car anyway.

I test drove two models:  Infiniti's i35 and the BMW 325xi.  

I had seen the new Infiniti on the road and liked it's looks, but didn't like the drive.  As with all Japanese cars, it's more of a "floaty" or "mushy" feel.  You are not really driving the car or attached to the road -- the engineering of these cars is so advanced that they are more a part of the process than the driver.  I don't like this, though I know that some do.  (Incidentally, the car was very nice -- just not for me.)

I then drove the 325xi.  BMW came out with it's all wheel drive mode the year after I bought my car.  It's still an option, and it's a costly one.  I traded down in engine size 2.8 to 2.5 so that I could afford this comfort.  It was worth it.

<b>The Body</b>
The car is heavy, weighing in at about 3500 lbs.  For a car it's size, this is meaningful.  You can really hear and feel the difference in the car when you shut the doors.  They are heavy, too. The weight is fairly evenly distributed, at 52%/48%, which makes the rider feel glued to the road.

As I purchased it, the car is black, with the luxury package (with a moonroof).  It has a clean look, that differs a bit from earlier models.  It's also shorter than the earlier models, but I can't find the specifics on this difference.  Please send me a comment if you get this info.

<b>The Internal</b>
As purchased, the internal of the vehicle is also all black, nicely appointed in leather and wood grain.  The design is very much like a cockpit, and the driver never has to move very far to reach his controls.  The radio and cruise control buttons are located on the steering wheel itself.  This makes for safer driving, as your hands never leave the wheel.  As in most luxury cars, the window controls are in the center console, which is always a bit confusing, as you'd like them to be on the door.  Even 5 years later, I still reach for them there :).  The shift option is activated by moving the shift to the right and up or down as necessary (more on that below).  

One of the better options is the heated seats.  Always feels great on a cold day.  Underneath the seat on the righthand drivers side is the seat memory option.  It's a great way to make sure that you always get your car the way you like it, and up to 4 drivers can store their preset seat levels.

Though I didn't get it, you can install a great radio in this car -- a bigger Harmon Kardon system than it ships with, and you can have a 6 CD changer.  I decided that the radio was fine for me, and it actually has 6 speakers in the front of the car, with a mid-range component.  It's far and away more than any non-serious audiophile needs.

<b>The Differences</b>
There are a few differences in the styling of this car.  BMW took all the chrome appointments off the car, excepting the grill.  This makes the body color more complete, and the car lines cleaner.  I think that the 325 is also a bit shorter than the 323/8 model, by about 10 inches or so.

The steering wheel is smaller, for more of a racing feel.  Before, the car had a larger, somewhat easier to handle wheel.

The steptronic transmission (the clutchless shift) is still available, but with one odd switch.  They changed the direction in which you need to upshift and downshift.  To downshift, you need to push away from you, where before it was the opposite.  On the plus side, this should not affect anyone except the users of this feature on older cars.  This is still the mode that I use in foul weather.  Since I've driven in 3 snowstorms in March/April, I can definitely vouch for the better feel in the snow.  The car doesn't exactly ride like a 4X4, but the all wheel drive makes a huge difference.  You are certainly more in control.  You can also drive up inclines.  This was (no kidding) a real problem in the rear wheel drive model, as the car was not heavy enough to stick to the road on any hill steeper than say 15 degrees.  I had to reverse my way up several hills in my development in inclement weather.

An interesting (and valuable) additional feature is called Hill Descent Control or HDC.  I'm not clear HOW it actually works, but it automatically slows down your car when you are proceeding down an incline in bad weather.  This works without the driver touching the break, so it's a safer way to slow down.  I've used it a few times.  It feels odd, but it sure does the trick.

Passengers who've ridden in both cars tell me that there is more head room in this car, and I think it's because the all wheel drive cars front wheels are moved up a bit toward the front of the car. 

The engine is smaller, and due to the change from rear wheel to all wheel drive, you don't feel the familiar press against the seat when you hit the accelerator.  I'm no Mario Andretti anyway, so I don't miss it that much.  There's enough pep for me.

All in all I love the car, feel safe in it in all weather, and most importantly, think that I look younger and cooler when I drive it :)
