            	May of 03 I decided it was time for a new vehicle. My Isuzu Rodeo was getting up there in mileage and I hate driving SUV's in the first place. Might as well drive a truck. But our lifestyle dictates certain priorities. Mainly I need to carry two bicycles on the interior of the vehicle. And we do many miles on weekends so mileage has become somewhat of an issue as well.
 So I went on a quest for something a little more sporting as well as somewhat economical to drive. After much measuring with a tape measure I had it narrowed down the ZTW Focus or a VW Jetta wagon. Interestingly enough I found both of these cars to have more interior room from the front seats back than my Rodeo. 
The VW dealers in SoCal tend to not be willing to deal. Now I was going to buy something, but I always want a deal. And for some reason at that time the ZTW&#146s were in short supply with options I desired. At that point I had pretty much given up for the time being, and was going to wait a month or two. We were heading on a weekend bicycle adventure and happened to stop buy an eatery that was near a Ford dealer. So I just stopped on past and there before my eyes were the exact color and optioned ZTW I had been looking for. It wasn&#146t over a half an hour before we struck a deal and we were off. 
We now have over 11,000 miles of weekend driving on the car and it has made quite an impression on me. 
Having to drive trucks and SUV&#146s most of my life I&#146ve gotten used to pushing them to their limits during mountain twisty driving. Not fun, but I hate those Porsches and Beemers passing me&#133. This little thing rocks in the mountains. Totally predictable handling. And this new 2.3-liter motor is exceptionally quick. It continually has impressed me. 
I fabricated a rack that fits in the back that holds the bicycles in place. You just pull the front wheels off and place the forks in the quick releases. Takes only minutes and we&#146re ready to roll. 
Recently we were heading to a bakery (this may sound funny) in Santa Ysabel to buy some bread. Dudley&#146s has the best bread in world&#133 But more importantly there is a cool twisty road heading the place. It was getting late and we wanted to get there before they closed, so I was heavy on the right foot. I came up on a newer BMW. As soon as he spotted me in his rear view mirror he got on the gas himself. We soon came upon another Beemer that actually pulled over for us. They jumped back in behind and we were having quite a fun threesome. It was probably as fast as I&#146d ever traveled that road except on a motorcycle once or twice years ago, but that&#146s another story. Evidently all three of us were heading for the bread store, as we all pulled in one after another. All of us were grinning at first until one of the Beemer owners asked me what sort of car that was. When I told him it was a Focus he looked confused. And that&#146s when he noticed that I had two bikes in the back. I think he felt bad&#133. Sorry but maybe he needs to learn how to drive a little better. But the Focus is impressive when driven correctly.
And I&#146ve only had one problem with the car since May. The rear door was slightly hard to close. It required a minor adjustment that I did myself. That&#146s it. Oil changes of course, but that is it. The Goodyear&#146s are just showing some wear but they are working hard. I&#146ll probably get some stickier rubber the next go round so I can play harder. 
All in all I&#146d say this vehicle has impressed me more than any car I&#146ve owned in years. I&#146m looking forward to buying another for the wife soon. She&#146s going to retire her Camaro to the Garage. She wants to play Focus with me&#133.
