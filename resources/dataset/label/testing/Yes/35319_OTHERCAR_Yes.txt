                 First of all, let me qualify this by saying that the B2300 is not a heavy-hauler.  The 2.3L engine lacks the power to haul large loads, and the owner's manual specifically states that the towing capacity is light or zero, depending upon the transmission installed.  If you're looking for a hauler, you need something else.
     That said, I love this thing.  I bought a used 1996 B2300 for a personal commuter/light hauler (I'm a college student living 850 miles from home, so I get to haul my stuff back and forth periodically).  It is small enough to use in town, easy to park, but has the conveniences of a truck.  It is very quiet (I've driven loud trucks; I have an '84 full-size pickup that you don't talk in, you yell), and very pleasant to drive.  Handling is outstanding--it's not a sports car by any means, but for a truck, it is exceptionally tight and responsive.  Mine is a 5-speed stick; with the 4-cyl, a stick is almost essential.  The engine, though small, is perfectly suitable when paired with the manual transmission.  It has plenty of get-up-and-go at low speed, though the power is somewhat lacking at highway speeds.
     As I said, it is a pleasure to drive.  The 60/40 split bench seat is comfortable, the upholstery is nice cloth, and the controls are well laid-out.  The stock sound system is excellent--very clear, good bass response, and develops plenty of volume.  The shifter is crisp and easy to use.  The layout is identical to that of the Ford Ranger; indeed, this truck is a Ford Ranger (since 1992 or 1993, all Mazda B-series trucks have been made by Ford).
     I bought the truck at 62,000 miles, and have put about 2500 on it since then, including one trip from home down here (850+ miles).  It is comfortable both for short- and long-haul driving.  One note: while there is a center seat, I would not use it for anything more than a few miles.  This is a compact pickup, and therefore the center seat is very small.
     I don't know anybody else with a Mazda B-series, but I do know some people with Ford Rangers; I have heard stories of the 4-cyl running for 200,000+ miles (I don't know anything about the V-6's, good or bad).
     Overall, I'm very happy with this truck, and would buy it again.<br><br>
