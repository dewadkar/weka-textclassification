            We recently purchased a 1995 Montero LS (flew down to Texas to pick it up).

So far we are very pleased with the car.  I am still undecided if it's a car or a truck. I think of it as a diminutive Suburban.  Speaking of Suburbans, this Montero replaced our aging `91 diesel Suburban (316k miles).  Sure it has less room than the Suburban, but it also offers outstanding comfort and adequate space.

The suspension is great!  It floats over Railroad crossings and other bumps.  I heard several complaints about tippiness (is that a word?) before we bought the car.  After driving it for a few months, I must say that the complaints are overdone.  No, it doesn't corner like our old Acura Legend, or my Datsun 280Z did in my teenage years, but it will get you there without ceremony.

I really like the Japanese attention to detail. For instance, there is a detachable flashlight in the rear compartment, alond with an extra 12-volt outlet. This is a thoughtful touch, often missing in American cars. The compass & thermometer on the dash are first rate!  These are very helpful features for us men--preventing us from having to stop and ask directions, and warning us of low temperatures in case we have to.  Very helpful.  My wife doesn't yet appreciate the 360-degree compass bearings, but someday she will.

Power:  Adequate, but not overwhelming. Actually it had more power than I anticipated (after reading various complaints).  It has a transmission button that alters shift points for more power when needed. Torque is about normal for a 3.0 V-6.  I am probably spoiled by my Powerstroke diesel trucks. The Montero is powerful enough for all driving. If I wanted to tow something, I would use one of my diesel trucks.

I love the driver view. Nice and wide. The sunroof is great too. The stereo is first-rate.

I haven't used the four wheel drive much (too nice of a winter).  It will work fine when needed.

Automatic transmission is nice. Seems to work well.

Interior is well thought out. It would be nice to have a few extra inches in width, but we don't suffer either way.

All in all, we like our Montero a lot, and it is a nice vehicle to travel in.  The `95 is a real nice year-- according to my research before buying ours. So are the 96-99 years. Feel free to get one.
