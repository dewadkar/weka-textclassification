            Last week, I traded in my Pontiac Grand Am SE for its sister, the GT version, which boasts a speedometer of up to 150 mph.  This really appeals to the child in me which is always ready to be the first off the starting line at every green light.  This baby packs a punch on acceleration and gives even my Honda motorcycle some competition.

This auto sports a rear spoiler, power sunroof, power windows, seats and doors, a cd player, dual tail pipes, RAM air, and a low body to ground ratio which gives it a more European appearance than its kissing cousin the Ford Mustang.  It's smooth and sexy for those young at heart folks who enjoy a good cruise now and then as well as a good drag race.  (Be sure to wear your seat belts)....

Whether you are a teen exiting into the real world of bills and expensive car payments, a middle-aged person in search of a little action, or a cute little old lady or man from Pasadena, you might just feel like a kid on Christmas morning, thinking that you were paid a visit by old Santa Claus during the night.  It's just that much fun.  I know, there are those stuffed shirts out there who think that driving is only a practical chore that is necessary to get one to and from work, the kids to the games, and shopping for necessities.  But if you think back, for some of us, way back, to the time when you got into your first car (or something resembling a box on wheels) and you recall that anticipation of turning on the ignition, hearing the plugs and pistons fire and feel the smoothness of the steering wheel in your tightly clenched hands, then you can imagine that it is only yesterday that you were young as you push the pedal to the medal in this sweet and smooth machine.  

True, it's no 57' Chevy Bel Air, but rather a marvel of modern technology--more smooth and much easier to handle than those bad boys of olden days.  You can cruise in luxury if you'd like, or you can be the first one off the line at the next green light you see.  If you can't tell from my enthusiasm, this is my very first new car, and I aim to enjoy it to the max.  It's all possible with this little GT.  Didn't you know?  GT stands for Good time, and that's what you'll have driving this sweetie.

Happy driving!
