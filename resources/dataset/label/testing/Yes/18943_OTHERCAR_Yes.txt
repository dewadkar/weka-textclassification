             I rented this car on our trip to Florida. We stayed at a very nice hotel except for one thing the Valet Parking service. On one day I had to go to a very important meeting close to my Hotel in Orlando. I called down to the Lobby, they said they would get my car. So I went down to get my car and the Galant was not here I! I asked where is it they said they lost my key. I got very mad, just think I flew from Austin Texas to Orlando, Florida for one meeting and I was about to miss it. I said give your car! They called a cab, on the way the cab driver told this was not the first time the hotel lost a key to a car. While I was away this happened. They called the rental company to ask what their policy was, they said the person who lost the key was to pay five houndred (500$) so they did not want to do this, they called their locksmith. He made a key but the car did not start. As I later found out the key has computer chip in it that will let only the original key start it.
 The only thing I did not like was the wind noise when you went above sixty-five. The cup holders are nice and the engine has good acccelaration.
