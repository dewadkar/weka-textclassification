            We had been looking at the 2000 Chevy Cavalier to be our first new car. It was not a lot of money, roomy for a small car and with 115 Bhp it had quite a bit of spunk. One day while out looking at cars with my brother we stopped at a Pontiac dealership to so he could look at the Grand Prix GTP, my husband and I were walking around the lot and saw quite a few 1999 Sunfires. They looked nice, but I wasn't to impressed. Then I saw the 2000 model. I decided right there that it was the car for us, and of course my husband liked it too.

What did I like about it? The body shape is demanding that you look at it. The front bumper has two 4&quot; amber parking lights that double as turn signals that can't be mistaking for anything else. The reverse lights are large and round and light up everything behind you. With the rear spoiler it gives it the look like it could go up against the big boys. We decided on the 115 Bhp instead of the 150 Bhp (and more expensive) engine. We were on a budget so we couldn't spend to much. The interior is done very nicely. It almost seems like it was molded around the passengers. The back seat was more than enough room even with the front seats far back. Believe it or not our Chevy Corsica is supposed to be a bigger car, but it has less room than the Sunfire. It's stereo system is unbelievable and I'm not just talking about the sound. The radio is an RDS system that allows the stations to send information over the waves along with the music. It has plently of storage space in the trunk, glove box, doors, and center console. 

Now how does it drive? 115 horses really get it moving. And with the optional 4-speed automatic it gets really good gas mileage. The engine itself makes almost noise, but does have a nice exhaust note that makes it sound tough. It has a very smooth ride and cornering is no problem for it. It also drives great in the snow because of the traction control system. It keeps the wheels from spinning to much so you can get going. Wind and other outside noises are almost not even there, even at 70 MPH.

So do I recommend this car? Oh yeah. But only for those that want a fun, reliable, inexpensive, nice looking and great car. If you want a more expensive car like this look at the BMWs. <br><br>
