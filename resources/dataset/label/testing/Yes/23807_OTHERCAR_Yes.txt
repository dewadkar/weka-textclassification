            I want to respond to &quot;Asianmistress&quot; who posted a comment about the Echo being a &quot;ridiculous car--you get what you pay for.&quot;  First of all, I am assuming you do not own an Echo, as every comment you made was specious, at best.  True, when I first went looking for a car, the Echo was not my initial choice because of its, shall we say, &quot;different&quot; look.  But the VERY moment I sat inside this little gem, I knew it was a great find.  On a public school teacher's budget, this car is a dream.  And, yes, I did test drive the &quot;crapass&quot; Kia and the equally &quot;crapass&quot; Hyundai.  Neither of these makes are known for reliability.  Furthermore, at this price level, don't purchase a car based on how it looks (as if the Kia actually had looks); it doesn't matter how hard you look, you're not going to find a 2000 Lexus-looking car for under 15k.  How can you go wrong with a Toyota product??  I even test drove a Civic, before purchasing the Echo--it was ordinary, at best and at price came with NONE of the extras my Echo did.  The Echo is peppy, extremely roomy (huge trunk) and amazing on gas mileage. I recently took my Echo up to Tahoe for a ski trip and it flew up the hills.  This car will make its owner happy.  One final comment about looks:  I get more attention on the road with the Echo. People smile and wave when you drive by, and at gas stations they say &quot;What kinda car is that--can I look inside??!!) They're always impressed by it spaciousness and &quot;space-age&quot; appeal.  VIVA LA ECHO!!!!<br><br>
