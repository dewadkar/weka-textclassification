            I recently purchased a Olympus C-2020 Zoom digital camera for our school.  We were in need of a versatile, light-weight, compact, yet easy to use digital camera.  The C-2020 is all of that and more.  

In addition to taking the traditional color photos, it has the ability to take black and white pictures, and also to take up to 60 seconds of QuickTime movies.  

There are three modes of color photos available:  normal quality, high quality, and super-high quality.  The super-high quality photos are virtually indistinguishable from regular photographs that have been scanned.

There is a timer and a remote control for taking photographs with the photographer in the picture.  There is a 3x physical zoom lens, with a 2x digital zoom to go with it, or a total of 6x zoom.

There is a LCD screen from which any picture or the menu may be viewed.

As I am using this camera more and more, I am finding it to be a great camera which will accomplish what our school needed it for.<br><br>
