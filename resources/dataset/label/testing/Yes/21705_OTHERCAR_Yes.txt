            I just bought my FIRST truck.  I've been running around in a little Pontiac Fiero for the last 4 years and decided it was time to get into something bigger.  I took a look at the Frontier on a dealers lot and said that's the one.  Without even looking inside the cab I could tell it had everything I needed.  I was looking for a small truck, an extended cab and style.  When I got into it, it was like a little piece of heaven.  The bucket seats were comfortable and there is plenty of leg room.  The fuel mileage should be great.  I was told it should be around 30 mpg on the highway.  I'll find out at Christmas time.  Having owned the truck for less then 24 hrs...it's hard to give any bad reviews.  The only 2 things that I noticed that wasn't right was 1) lack of anyplace to put things such as an emergency kit in....the extended cab area is great but there aren't any holders to keep things from rolling around and keeping things neat. #2 is the drivers' seat...it might be just the difference of a sports car and the truck seats but my hip felt like I was sitting at an angle instead of straight on....We'll see over time if this is true or just my imagination.<br><br>
