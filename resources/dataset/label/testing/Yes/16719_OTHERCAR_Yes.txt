            For most of the years until now , Indonesian Market not so good for all used peugeot Cars resale value , What's wrong ? There was a certain reason like high maintenance cost , not reliable engine , petrol thirst , and the worst issues especially on 405 models that : This car often burn on the road !!!.  This makes me wonder Why ? . So on July 1996 I try to buy the second hand 405 SR with overheating problems, with the Price Rp.27.500.000,- (arround Rp.1 = US$ 4,000.- rates).
Soon I find that The fan (2 Pc) on front just work on 85`C on half speed and 95`C on full speed !(noted that Indonesia on Tropical &amp; many heavy traffic jam) I adjust it with a potenciometer that I put under dashboard which makes me able to control that situation. ( contact me at susantosan@yahoo.com for detailed figure ). That's all !
until now (Nov 2000) I feel happy with that Black coloured car !.
Other problem on that fragile machine just need special attention for leakage sealing (rubbers part) that sometimes makes trouble for you!   <br><br>
