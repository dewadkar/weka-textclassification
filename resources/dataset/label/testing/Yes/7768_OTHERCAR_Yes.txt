            My husband and I just got our 325i a couple of months ago.  IT IS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  I have always been a "cheap car" person.  I was pretty hesitant about this purchase, but have no regrets now.  

I have NO IDEA what "Ally McBeal" is talking about--"handles like a Ford Contour"?!?  I don't think so.  When someone backed into our new 325 and it was in the body shop, we rented a Contour.  That car was a disaster in comparison.  Looks like Ally is a typical female driver who has no idea how to approach and analyze the driving experience.  (Come on, men: admit it.  We have no idea how to appreciate a car.)

So now about the car: Ah...the crisp handling, the good acceleration, and the easy maneuverability are just where it starts.  The braking system is totally excellent and goes way beyond the usual anti-lock.  This car is quiet and very responsive without overdoing it: i.e., some cars will continue to turn the steering wheel when you've just lightly touched it, etc.  Not this car.

The way the cruise control works is slightly unique from that which I have experienced in other automobiles.  It's a little easier to operate.  

I like the bilateral lighted mirrors, convenient invisible change holder, and other sleek places to stow miscellaneous items.  Smokers (I'm not one) will love the front AND back ashtrays, each with its own lighter.

We have the "sports package", which includes a ski bag in the trunk that expands into the passenger area via the arm rest; 17" low-profile tires (not crazy about these, but it looks good on the 325); fold-down rear seats; front seats that extend forward for extra leg resting; and stereo controls on the steering wheel, which has a slightly different design than the usual 325 steering wheel.  Leather seats are mandatory with the sports package.  

As an aside, I don't generally like leather in cars, but this is textured such that it doesn't get too hot or sticky.  It's quite nice.  

There are other items in the sports package, but I can't remember them all.

Safety features include bilateral front, side, and head airbags for those in front, and side airbags for those in back; the complex computer-chip key that makes the car just about impossible to steal; and an alarm system.  There are some other things such as a valet key.  Also, the frame is in one piece instead of different panels--no seams.  These come to mind now, but there are others.

I have used the car both as a commuter car and for a couple of very long road trips so far, and it has proved to be quite adaptable in both situations.  On the long trips, the CD player and the forward-extending front seats have really come in handy.  On the commuter trips--well, let me put it this way: my husband and I work together, and he drives us to and from work.  He used to get really bad headaches in traffic in our old cars (a Neon and a Jeep Cherokee), splitting headaches.  Well, he doesn't get them anymore.  This BMW is quiet and just sooooooo goooood in traffic.

We are both medical residents, so this purchase was a bit of a stretch for us.  However, we did want to try an entry-level BMW to see if we'd want one later.  I have to tell you: I don't think I'd want to drive anything else after this.
