            It was the best of vans; it was the worst of vans.  It ran forever; it barely ran.  It never went to the shop;  It was never out of the shop.  This is the story of the two Plymouth Voyager's that my parents have owned.  

Surprisingly, my mom's van ran like a charm.  Even though she drove like a bat out of hell compared to my dad, her van has lasted twice as long and has had 1/2 the cost of repairs.  My dad, the ever-so-careful driver, the never takes the gas pedal down more than an inch, the never take the RPM over 2,000, the never slam on the brakes, the Sunday driver (forgive me if you're a Sunday driver), the lover of all cars big or small, accumulated more miles driving his van to the shop than he did driving anywhere else.

It is fairly obvious that my dad got a lemon of a car and my mom got the non-lemon (cherry).  My mom's van, a 1994, has been on many vacations and has over 180,000 miles on it.  My dad's van, a 1995, has been sold, but was a year newer and had less than 100,000 miles on it.  After 3 years of ownership, my dad had to replace the transmission on his van.  After 180,000 miles, my mom's van is lucky to get a fill-up on gasoline, but it's heart still beats.  It will not die. 

My dad's van had many other problems, besides the transmission.  I am not exactly sure what was wrong with it, but it was in the shop at least 5 times per year.   Both vehicles were put on a military like regiment of 3,000 mile oil changes and routine maintenance.  One van just outlasted the other van by a few lifetimes.

You may be asking, &quot;Okay, so what's this supposed to tell me about Plymouth Voyagers?&quot; 

My reply, &quot;That buyer should beware and check out a few other opinions before buying a Plymouth Voyager.  My experience has been with only two vans, which allows for great deviation due to random sampling error.&quot;  <br><br>
