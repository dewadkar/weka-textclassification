            I've driven both the newly designed and the late model (pre-200) Grand Cherokees, and I'll be very enthusiastic in saying the new Cherokee is a vast improvement over the old one.


The DRIVE:
As far as SUVs go, this Jeep drives nicely on smooth pavement. The limited V8 model has an unbelievable amount of power. It will out-accelerate many cars. The handling, however, is poor as the Jeep has a high center of gravity. Granted it does well for an SUV, but I basing the "standard" of handling on that of your average car.
The brakes on this car are powerful. They are able to bring this beast to a hault quickly and efficiently. Steering seems a little numb while on the highway.
In general though, this SUV drives well on smooth roads.
Off-roading, or rough roads are another story. When driving on uneven or no pavement, this SUV rocks from side to side quite violently. It will cross over most terrain that other SUVs will, and does so quite capably (I took this truck off-roading) however, the quality of the off-road ride is poor. 

Interior: The cabin of this car is very nicely crafted. The leather on the seats is soft and comfortable. Climate and radio controls are intuitive and within easy each. The sound system appears to be very high quality. Sound is very clean, and bass is powerful. The rear seats fold up, so plenty of cargo room is available. Also, there's plenty of room up front for the driver and passenger.

In closing: If you must get an SUV, this is a fine choice. No SUV can handle or drive like a car, but for what most SUVs are used for, the Jeep does a fine job.
