            Christmas is upon us and my family needed to remember the occasion so we needed to take pictures of the holidays.   We went for a digital experience and found this polaroid camera to be simple to use with the results we wanted.  The price was in our range and the experience was wonderful.  The download to my computer was effortless and the whole experience was painless.  The best feature was how simple to use, the worst feature was waiting for pictures to print.  Overall I found this product to be a best buy for my family.  I truely recommend this camera for a newcomer to computers such as myself it was and is a learning experience about technology.<br><br>
