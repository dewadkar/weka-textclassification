            I bought it as my first digital camera and was satisfied totally 

The look was great. The LCD screen size is ample.

The only con is that the battery drains out too soon. So have a backup set of recharge able batteries

As a first time buyer of a digital camera, I did not know anything about digital cameras. When I was looking for a digital camera, my brother suggested to buy a camera with pixels between 2 and 3 mega pixels. It seems that cameras with 1.3 mega-pixels are the standard for the most of digital cameras in the market. However, the quality of a picture taken by a 1.3 mega-pixel camera seems slightly less than a normal picture taken by a non-digital camera. 

So how good is 2.1 mega-pixels? The real quality of pixels can be tested when a picture is enlarged. I was just amazed to see how much a 2.1 mega-pixel digital picture can be enlarged without losing its clearness. A 8"X10" blow up can be printed with great results when clicked at best resolution and quality. You need to try it. 

The camera also comes with a 8 MB memory card and 2.5x digital zoom. I bought a 64 MB card for cheap and this stores as many photos as 600 photos at 600X480 resolution and 125 photos at the max resolution of 2.1 mega pixel.

As is the case for other digital cameras, the data can be easily sent by e-mail to a friend or can be printed by a high level color picture printer. 
The included software and the U.S.B. link-up make uploading photos to your computer a breeze! The software makes a virtual drive for the camera and can use the windows explorer to download pictures. There is a good image editing and album software included.

The quality of the picture printed by those high quality printers is not different (or better) from a picture taken by a non-digital camera. Also, if a picture did not turn out as you intended, the picture can be erased immediately without getting printed. 

Considering its price (less than $150), Fine pix 2300 offers the best value for a digital camera with over 2 mega pixels. 

In summary, just beware of the lack of optical zoom and bad battery life.
