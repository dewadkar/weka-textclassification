            I&#146ve been a semi-professional photographer for nearly 30 years now, depending on my trusty Canon AE1 and viewing digital cameras as either inadequate or far too expensive. The Z1, however, brought me into the digital fold. It is a benchmark in digital photography, providing professional-level controls and speed with excellent optics and features at an entry-level price.

The controls of the Z1 are well laid out, and the menus are easy to navigate, discrete controls are provided for flash, macro, zoom and exposure programs. Exposure programs allow for Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture priority, and full manual mode, as well as a wealth of pre-programmed options. 

The Z1 is fast. In manual focus mode, there is no perceptible delay between pressing the shutter and actuation. In autofocus (AF) mode, the AF takes only a fraction of a second in regular light, but can be a bit indecisive in low-light situations. Continuous shutter mode yields approximately 1.5 FPS. 

With an optical zoom equivalent to a 38-380mm lens, the Z1 has a phenomenal range. Optical quality is excellent, with few effects in head-on lighting situations, little distortion and good clarity. Macro up to 1.7 inches rounds out a very flexible arrangement. 

One feature which I really enjoy in bright light is the digital viewfinder. Rather than trying to shade a LCD monitor to see the image, the viewfinder provides a through-the-lens view easily visible even at the beach. When you switch from monitor to viewfinder, a shade snaps over the monitor with a satisfying mechanical click and the viewfinder illuminates.

The built-in flash is adequate to provide basic fills and low-light illumination. A hotshoe for external flash is provided for more demanding applications.

At an average retail price of $399.00 ($499 MSRP), the Z1 is an outstanding value. If only they would bring the price of the AC adapter down, ($70 for a transformer and plug?) they would have an absolutely unbeatable combination.
