            The Chrysler Town &amp; Country is the second mini van we have owned and it is a pure pleasure. I was never into min vans and really had to have my arm twisted by the family before I considered buying one. My first experience with a Mercury Villager was good but I eventually got frustrated with the single side door, and the lack of cargo space when all the seats were installed. 

The Town &amp; Country has removed any last reservation I had about a mini van. It comes fully loaded with all the features you could ask for, and is a pleasure to drive. The two side doors really helps in loading small children and even with all the seats installed you still have an impressive amount of space both inside the car and behind the bench seat. Installation and removal of the seats is simple, and having the bench seat on castors is a real back saver. The list of features is endless, but things like the leather captain seats, split air system (even for driver and passenger), sound system, automatic lighting on entry &amp; exit, built-in garage door opening, etc. make this an easy to use family vehicle.

The 3.8 V6 delivers adequate power and even with a full load the van is responsive and nervous. Road noise is minimal, doing long trips is easy and relaxing. In most cases the kids fall asleep which says something for the comfort and calm in this van. 

Few vehicle have ever really satisfied me across the board, but this is the exception. If you have a family and miss the comfort and pleasure of a luxury car, this is the van for you. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one, and I haven't seen another van that I'd replace it with.
