            If you want a great looking car that is sporty, but is not to expensive, I think you should consider the Chevy Camaro. The new camaros are unchanged for 2000, and you can buy them 3 different ways:

3.8 liter/200 horsepowe v6,
(not enough power?)
5.7 liter 305 hp v8
(STILL not enough?)
SS 320 hp.  0-60 mph in 5.2 sec.

The camaro will cost about $17,000-$34,000
The new camaros are a pleasure to drive, and the ride so smooth, and offer a decent amount of power, even witht the v6's. I am not disappointed with them at all.

The camaros do have a new wheel design for this year, and you can get an optinal 12 disc CD changer in the SS package, along with its very own SS spoiler.

Onr e thing I must say about chevy, and I am not to happy about it, is the body designs that have on the camaros these days. The ugliest yet....<br><br>
