            My wife and I purchased our CRV as a replacement to my wife's love of her Ford Explorer which was traded in.  As the CRV is considered a sub-SUV, it's hard to compare it to other SUV's such as the Explorer.  However, as a owner of two previous Honda's, I knew what the CRV was lacking in size and power, it would certainly make up for in dependability and gas mileage.  

The closest comparison would have to be the Toyota RAV 4.  From the outside, the RAV 4 has a better &quot;immediate&quot; attractiveness, however one soon finds that the CRV has better overall lines.  The front has the typical Honda look, similar to the Accord, Prelude and Civic, which it's based on.

Inside there is no comparison.  Honda went to the extreme in making the inside very roomy.  My only complaint would be the front seats.  Better lumbar support would help on extended drives.  The backseat is probably the most spacious and comfortable of any backseat, car or SUV.  Driver and passenger sit more in a chairlike position, rather than an inclined position, with legs out front, similar to a car, and other SUV's.  One feature backseat passengers would enjoy are the way the backseats incline, making long hauls that much more comfortable.

The car handles very well, with a very tight turning space.  Navigating busy malls or grocery stores are no problem.  Even turning into a space facing the other direction is no problem.

For basic transportation, the CRV is tops.  I wouldn't recommend it for hauling anything over 2000 lbs though.<br><br>
