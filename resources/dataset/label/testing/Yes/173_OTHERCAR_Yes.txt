            Although I have been taking pictures for a long time, digital cameras are new territory for me.  I bought my Fuji MX 1200 from Computers 4 Sure.  They gave me the best price.  The controls are easy to understand and it doesn't &quot;eat&quot; batteries like some others I've seen.  The Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home Edition 3.0 that comes with it is GREAT!  You do not have to have a degree to take and share great shots.  Keep in mind, it does not come with a case or power cord adaptor.  If you purchase extra flash cards and the floppy adaptor, you will have an unlimited amount of shots to share!  Also, the floppy adaptor eliminates the need for a power cord.  I keep an extra set of alkaline's in my case.  You don't have to buy expensive photo batteries.  Rechargeable batteries can make it even more cost effective and environmentally friendly.  Although, I haven't had it very long, I have yet to find anything about it I don't like.<br><br>
