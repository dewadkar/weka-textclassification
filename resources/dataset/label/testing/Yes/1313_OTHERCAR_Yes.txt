            Why did you buy this vehicle?

I leased a black 1998 Honda Passport because I was tired of having my '83 Chevy Blazer towed and repaired.  At the time, there was a lease offer by Honda that I couldn't pass up.  I had other SUVs in mind, such as the Ford Explorer Sport, Isuzu Rodeo, and even a new Chevy Blazer.  The Passport had appealed to me the most after test driving all of them and checking out their numbers.  Also, this was the year that Honda/Isuzu decided to give their SUVs a facelift from the past of hard bulky corners and edges.  That year, the new Passport was given a new front grill in addition to the softer and bulgier wheel fenders.  Plus, I must admit that I was slightly Honda-biased.


Describe what you love and hate about this vehicle.

I loved the new lines and profile that this Passport had compared to the older editions.  The instrumentation of the dash was also very Honda styled with softer key buttons and controls and very legible gauge read outs.  From what I understand, the newer Passport was redesigned from the chassis up and expanded and lengthened for extra room all around.  You can also notice the stance of the truck was more wider thus giving a more stable ride around cornering.  


What is it like to drive this vehicle?

I thought this vehicle gave a quiet, smooth and decent ride compared to the other SUVs I had mentioned earlier.  It had decent power and I liked the fact that the 4-wheel drive option was accessible through the touch of a button.  There was also plenty of cargo room in the back.  I also like the fact that the newer Passport attached the spare tire to the rear access door and still have the rear window able to open.  

The only thing that I could probably complain about this SUV was that it housed a 3.2l engine that wasn't too great at the gas pumps.  I thought that Honda/Isuzu could've put a bigger engine to haul the heavy truck with ease.


What is it like to drive this vehicle?

The drive of the Passport was quite enjoyable.  The noise level was down to a minimum and the ride wasn't harsh.  The seats were of cloth that added to the comfort of the ride during long trips.  this particular model didn't include a CD player rather an am/fm cassette stereo system which had pretty decent  sound and base for a stock audio system.  Around cornering, I thought that this vehicle could've used better shocks to hold it's tilt.  However, the trade-off would be a stiffer ride than a comfortable one.


Who should buy this vehicle? Who shouldn't?

I think the only person(s) who should seriously consider purchasing this vehicle would be the start-up families with 2-3 kids.  This is a decent SUV that offers all the creature comforts and quality that Honda is known for in their automobiles.  Though the Passport is originally built by Isuzu and is really a Rodeo with different badges and details.  I believe that this would be an excellent choice for a first timer of SUV buying.  

However, consider the Isuzu Rodeo since it's practically the same vehicle and has a better warranty.
