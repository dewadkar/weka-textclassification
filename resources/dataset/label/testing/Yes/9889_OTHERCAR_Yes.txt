            	If you can't afford a Dodge Ram, or want something smaller than that beast of a truck, get the Dakota. Put quite simply, there is no better small truck. Whether an automatic or stick, the Dakota is a very smooth and easy truck to drive--in fact, the only difference between driving a Dakota and a nice car is that it's longer, a little trickier to park, and definitely has some guns under the hood.
	Although the paneling seems to have less durability against dents than I would have liked, the Dakota feels both solid and also not too heavy to drive. With the R/T option, you get plenty of horsepower for either hauling cargo or hauling ass! Quick off the start, there are few trucks, and even few standard cars, that will beat this truck off the line. I would suggest, however, customizing the truck a bit--tires, a bed cover, and a better stereo system are recommended.
	For the price, though, you will not find better. Reliable, quick, safe, attractive, and easy to handle, the Dakota is the small truck for all purposes, city or country, carrying cargo or just your friends--you won't regret buying Dodge!<br><br>
