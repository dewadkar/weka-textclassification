            Amid the crowded world of compact and subcompact cars you may wish to consider one that is currently still a market sleeper with accompanying lower prices, too. I'm speaking of the all new Mazda Protege (which unlike Civic, Corolla, and Sentra is still built in Japan, by the way). As you may know one or another version of the Protege has been around for quite a while. Like some/most of you I have quite a number of acquaintances who drive one of the earlier versions. I am chagrined to say it now but I actually had to rid myself of some wrongly held prior impressions gained from all that secondhand knowledge, particularly that the Protege was an okay ride, but clearly very forgettable in comparison with the best of a host of other choices. Luckily a clear head showed me the danger of this secondhand info because upon fully considering all the choices I found the newest little Mazda enough improved and such a good value for the dough that I brought one home for my daily driver.

Even the briefest glance shows the looks of the current Protege to lie somewhere between boring and acceptable, depending on the viewer. The interior matches the outside ...okay, I'll say it, it's very functional. All Proteges are four door, four passenger family sedans. I know... I know... What's that about them seating only four passengers? Yep... Please take my word for it. Don't plan on using the middle seatbelt for any human being bigger than a toddler. In a crunch, maybe you can squeeze the mother-in-law in (that is, if she REALLY has been staying on that diet), but otherwise leave that space for the big atlas case ...because there is no map pocket on the seat back :( . So why did our little family of three buy one of these? Hmm... I suppose for all the standard reasons: price, mileage, Japanese reliability, and of course, price, price, price. Along with what we paid for we were delighted to find more than a bit of style and comfort had been thrown in at no extra charge. Pretty nice. The Protege comes in three levels: DX, LX, and ES. But even in the DX (cheapest) model, there's lots of stuff standard, including a pretty nice-sounding CD. The ES (the top of the line) comes loaded with power everything, yet still remains reasonably priced. The LX is ...well... it's in the middle. For us the difference in price between an LX and an ES was so small that we opted to spring for the little bit higher price and enjoy the very top of this nice line.  I especially liked the slight horsepower increase, the missus liked the color *shrug* Anyway, when we made the final deal we both agreed to get the one with the power sunroof, too. While it probably will only be rented by the day by drag racers, the little car delivers very acceptable freeway acceleration and handles much, much better than it really has to. I can also say it does not suffer any of the nervous darting or highway rub strip bouncing that we noticed when driving several of its more familiar competitors. Like you this was not the only car we considered. We also drove (and almost bought) a new Honda Civic--this is also a very competent small car--so let me say something special to all those of you about to buy from the tried and true segment leader: Folks, you really owe it to yourself to drive a Protege BEFORE you write out that Honda deposit! It's my bet you may find a use for the thousand or so bucks that the fine little (and oh-so-similar) Mazda Protege will save you if you will just give it a bit of a closer look.

Let me summarize all this for the latecomers. Mazda's Protege is one of only a very few smaller cars that have been built for buyers who though are on a budget still are young enough at heart to be swayed by a fun little car. Those who are and give this car a look and a test drive might well be writing their own glowing reviews next year.<br><br>
