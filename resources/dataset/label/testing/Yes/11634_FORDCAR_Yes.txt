            I wanted something that could haul anything, anywhere, and at anytime.  At the same time, I wanted it to have a comfortable ride, and good handling.  My Ford Explorer Limited has done all of this and more. I've only had to do regular maintenance services. If I were to knock it, I wish it stood taller on the road.  Mine is a 1995 and has performed better than I expected.  I do wish utility vehicles got a little better gas mileage.  The seats are comfortable on long trips.  I'm not beat up nor fatigued when I get to my destination.  It's a nice compromise between a regular road car, van &amp; pick-up truck.  I'd highly recommend one to any one looking for versatility.  If you want a vehicle that will do many things besides get you there, you should definitely consider a utility vehicle.  You won't be disappointed.       <br><br>
