            In March of 1999, we purchased a 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager.  Our daughter just turned two and we were planning for more children.  At the time, we owned a 1999 small sedan.  Even with the one child there wasn't enough room, so we looked at the Grand Voyagers.  We purchased one with built in car seats and double  sliding doors.   Those options were a major selling point.  We also like the CD player, power windows/locks, and cruise control.  Space is not an issue anymore.  There is more than enough room for a stroller, diaper bag and groceries. It is a great handling vehicle and is great on gas.  It is the best vehicle purchase that we have ever made.  I highly recommend it to a growing family!!<br><br>
