            The Dodge Durango, classy!  Very sporty with many luxuries.  Built to last.  It has a solid seven frame, with boxed 35,000-psi steel with seven crossmembers is the stuff this ladder frame is made of.  For extra protection, the ladder frame is coated with corrosion-resistant paint, so no hot wax coatings here, like competetors use.  It has a 25 gallon fuel tank with nylon fuel lines to resist corrosion, and it is mounted very securely.  Now the body is electrocoated in a nine-step immersion process.  The winshield was extended to increase visibility.  You can take your pick of the 3 different engines, all delivering amazing horsepower.  The only bad point would have to be the price but with a vehicle like this why not spend the extra to get what you want.

I recently bought a 2000 Durango and I love it.  It is fully loaded.  It is classy, powerful, as well as sporty.  I really love the room I have, I can carry my whole family or my friends with out any one complaining.  Driving the Durango isn't as bad as you might think it is smaller than most SUV's so it is easier to manuver, I can whip into any parking spot there is and not have any trouble at all.  If you are looking for alot of room with out driving a huge SUV this it the vehicle for you.  <br><br>
