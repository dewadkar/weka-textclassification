            Being a young professional, money was tight yet I wanted the feel of a luxury automobile at a reasonable price. Having looked at the BMW 3 series and Mercedes C-class, my mind was set on the Audi A4 2.8. No other car offered a mix of luxury, sporty ride, and aesthetics on four wheels. 

When I say this car drives like a good book, I mean you don't want to stop once you've turned the key. It goes where you point it, and it moves at the driver�s command. The 2.8 is fluid like in acceleration and torque. The gears shift seamlessly and the vehicle makes lane changing on the freeway almost effortless. Furthermore, this car is an excellent head turner. The lines are simple and the many different color pallets the factory offers makes it hard to have two of the same at your office parking lot. Once in the drivers seat, all the luxury amenities you can ask for are at your fingertips. Audi has designed all the buttons and controls with the driver in mind. Unlike BMW or Mercedes, the climate control is simple to use esp. with the traditional "German icon" displays. Other perks such as the Bose Symphony Stereo System is well worth the extra cash up front. The highs are crisp and clean, the bass isn�t annoying but rather complementary if tuned correctly with the 8-band eq, a radio feature which the owners manual forgets to indicate. The leather power seats ease any long commute and the red back light on the instrument cluster and control panels are not only different but also easy on the eyes at night. 

My only complaint is that Audi has been known for having electrical problems with their vehicles since time began. My problem was with the Bose Stereo Head Unit. I did experience a slight LED problem a month after purchasing the vehicle. The LED displaying the radio station would periodically flash and this did get a bit annoying esp driving at night. However because Audi stands firmly to its Audi Advantage warranty, my stereo was replaced at no cost and I haven�t had a problem since. Secondly, rear legroom is just enough for small children or short adults. Just be prepared to see shoe marks on the rear door panels. 


Aside from these minor glitches, I am completely satisfied with my Audi. I can�t wait till the payments are finished so I can move on to the A6.
