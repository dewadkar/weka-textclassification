            i've been using my huge 1.3 mega pixel camera for quite a while.  It's too big to fit comfortably in my pocket, and 1.3 mega pixel is pretty much way-out-dated.  starting up speed is slow, and taking pictures take even longer.  I need something that fixes all of that.

So one day I was visiting a Sharper Image store and found out about the EX-S2.  The incredible size instantly got my attention.  So I asked the store person to take it out of the shelf and let me play with it for a while.  After about 5 minutes I decided that I absolutely need this.

Usually when I'm looking for electronic things I would research online first, find out about all competitive models, find out about all the features, goods, and bads, and find out about street pricing.  Not in this case.  As soon as I tried it out it was already too good for me to pass off.

So I decided to get one but the Sharper Image store don't have it in stock (the initial shipment of 5 EX-S2 all sold out and they don't carry EX-M2) so I ordered one.  About 10 days later I got it in the mail.  Everything I need is in the package.  Software, manuals, USB docking station, the battery, wrist strap, and of course the camera itself.

PHYSICAL:
the camera is tiny.  About the size of a credit card, and about the thickness of a credit card case.  Fits perfectly in my pockets.  Lightweight yet sturdy.  No loose parts.  The docking station is small and good looking also.  LCD screen is pretty big and works fast enough to catch up to my movements.  I love the tiny size.  I can carry it around like I don't have it, and take it out to take pics without looking like a tourist with a big camera.

USING:
navigation through menus are easy.  Everything is laid out pretty intuitively.  The only problem I find is that the joysticks are a bit small.  Sometimes clicking to the sides would end up being a pressing-down-click.  But after a few weeks of using it I'm more used to it now.  Switching modes are easy, deleting/protecting pics are easy also.  Basically a very easy to use camera.

UPLOADING/SOFTWARE:
I installed the software but never really used it.  When I plug the camera onto the docking station and turn the power on, it will show up as a REMOVABLE DRIVE on my computer.  I can simply click-and-drag the JPG and MPG files right off the camera and paste onto my hard drive.  This is so simple, I don't need to use the included software.

TAKING PICS:
When you hit the shutter that's about the EXACT TIME the camera would take the picture.  Super-fast response, super-fast refresh rate.  Perfect for instant-moments or spying-shots (nice cars you see on freeways, ugly faces friends are making, etc.)  Using BEST SHOT mode, 6 pre-configured configurations (lol) can be selected for different types of images ranging from nightview or portrait to twilight and black/white.  White balance, flash mode, and EV shift can be set to the quick-keys.  Very intuitive.

IMAGE QUALITY:
I find the image quality decent enough for a tiny camera like this one.  I assume the targeted consumer range for the Exilim is not the hardcore professional digital photographers, but those who needs a camera that is very easy to carry around yet offers great image quality.  2.0 mega pixels is the minimum requirement for today's digital cameras (coming from 1.x mega pixels I've suffered enough from poor image quality.)  The 3 picture sizes (640x480, 1280x960, and 1600x1200) matched with the 3 levels of quality (fine, normal and economy) gives you alot of freedom as to which type of images you would like.

For example, on a day when you are out with friends attending a birthday party.  Using fine quality with 640x480 image size gives you 56 available image spaces.  That is enough pictures to keep track of people places and things, yet the quality and image size is perfect for viewing on the computer and E-mailing them to others.

When you want to take a picture of your wife/girlfriend (husband/boyfriend for ladies who are reading this), using 1600x1200 image size with fine quality offers 11 available shots, more than enough to get the best quality pictures to edit on the computer or for digital prints and custom mouse pads.

Now having expanded memory means taking MANY MANY pictures with the largest size and the finest quality.  Imagine going to a car show with hundreds of pictures to take.  extended memory in SD or MMC card formats will dramatically increase the memory size, giving you maximum freedom to snap away.

Of course 2.0 mega pixels will not satisfy those who demand the best image quality and image size, however keeping a credit card-size digital camera and taking fine pictures with it will not get any better than this.  I think the EX-S2 has done a great job on keeping its promises:  feature packed digital camera in a handy size.

Some small good things I like:
- quick-keys that are define-able (I have mine set to white balance for quick indoor/outdoor adjustment when AUTO doesn't do it fast enough)
- turn the beeping off for quiet operation
- easy "removable drive" style drag-and-drop file transfer

Some small things they should improve:
- more quick-keys for shortcuts.  2 is not enough. (I need at least 4)
- joystick could be bigger.  My big fingers usually messes up.
- digital zoom isn't all that great.  optical zoom would be much better.

UPDATE (Dec. 17th, 2002) ESC-1 Leather Case for the Exilim

Got the ESC-1 Leather Case for Exilim cameras today.  Cost me 19.99 plus tax (same price as from Casio.com)  Very nicely made.  Genuine leather is soft on the surface yet sturdy under.  Snaps close with a button-lock.  The back of the case features cut-out openings for the joystick, all the buttons, and the screen.  Very convenient.  Lets you take pictures without taking the camera out of the case (I first thought only the suede case ESC-2 lets you do that.  I'm wrong.)

This is a very important accessory to me, as I keep my camera in my pocket all the time, and it will rub against my cell phone (my other pocket has my wallet and car keys).  With this case it protects against any scratching or even accidental drops (somehow cushions it alittle).  The classy look of the case will match with most wallets (it looks just like a leather wallet, not a camera case that's cheesy and made from plastic).  Definitely a must-have.  At 19.99, it is and will pretty much always be the best camera case for the Exilim camera.
