            I am from the UK, so I am going to just saythat you may not have heard of some of the cars in the following op, but you will have heard of the car being tested...

I am going to be frank. I am not old enough quite old enough to drive. Despite this I love cars from the BMW to the Volvo. For years I have had a huge - and often disturbing - amount of car knowledge. I know many things apart from being able to drive. Which is why when my Dad has to change hsi car every few years he is harassed by me so I can get him the best possible car. 

In 1999 my Dad was in-line for a new car and yours truely was the first to get involved. Now my Dad doesn't really like cars but he bares with it. Being part of a company my Dad was to get a company car and so we got a list of cars we could have. As his job involved ferrying things around the country he needed a big car - prefrably an estate. Soon I was delving into the brochures, trying to find the best car for my Dads needs. The list consisted of ... (you may not have heard of these)

Ford Mondeo (the most popular passenger car in the UK) estate 
Mazda 626 (slightly different to the US version) estate 
VW Passat estate 
Vauxhall Vectra (based on the Saturn L) estate 
Citroen Xantia estate 

The list was small but I worked hard to find the best car. First up was the Mondeo. We decide that the Mondeo was a big car but was ageing rapidly. The dumpy looks put my Dad off so he didn't bother with the test drive. He never really thought of buying a Mazda and the bland 626 was the pinnacle of boredom. Unforunately, my Dad can be a bit car-predjudice - you know he'd buy a VW not a Skoda or buy a European car not a little known but just as good Korean car. This meant the Vauxhall, and their image which has been flushed down the toilet more times than Vanessa Feltz TV career, was never going to be on top of the list. It was the same with the Citroen. To him it rented the phrase 'A French car on my driveway' - see what I mean. 

That left the VW. The Passat was the favourite from the beginning - I sound like a football commentator - and in the end saw my Dad reaching for the cheque books - well the company anyway. For the last few years we had been tootling around in an Audi A4. It was the best car we had ever had - no problems or anything. Its quality, drive, style and of course that badge meant it was a cut above the rest in the street. But it had to go as the contract ran out. It seemed only real if we stayed in the VW group. So we now owned the VW Passat 1.6 Estate and we were all looking forward to owning it. 

My dad took delivery of it at the beginning of 2000 and has since ran without a murmur. My Dad has truely enjoyed driving it. He is constantly telling me how good the car is. He always says that the car handles better than any other estate. The larger body doesn't compromise the Passats handling either. We live in Suffolk and the twisty bends should take its toll on the big car but no. Apparantly the Passat remains nimble and involving - those journalsts no nothing. 

From my point of view there are no better looking estates around at the moment even after a few years. True the Passat has just been refreshed but it is just a small makeover on an already good-looking car. The simple styling is understated and although it doesn't jump out at you, its clean-cut lines wouldn't look out of place in the worlds most competative area - the executive car park. Indeed, my Dad has inspired many to buy the Passat and many have done. The interior is superior though. It like its exterior is simple but very effective and the build quality is second to none. The reassuring black plastics look and feel as solid as the day it left the production line. 

Thanks to my Dads demanding job he needs a big boot to take his equipment and the Passat doesn't fail there either. Flick the remote cental locking and prise open the boot and you'll find yourself staring into a dark abyss - no I haven't forgotton to open my eyes. Okay its a bit exaggerated but the boot is that big. Drop the rear seats and the Passat is as good a workhorse as any other car. It is finally the first ever spacious, stylish estate on the market. 

The best thing about this car though is the name. The Passat doesn't need to attach Touring or Avant to its name. Although estate is dowdy its quality is enough to secure any buyers names to their sales list. 

So far I have praised this car to the moon and back but unfortunately like all cars there is a problem. When we had the Audi we went to our nearest Audi dealer. When we bought the Passat we went to the same dealer but the VW derivative. However, while the Audi sevicing was exemplary, the VW service has been appaling. The Passat has been very good but when it goes for a service there is always a problem 

The list of VW dealership problems... 

Should have been back by 12.00 - didn't get it back till 5.00 
The VW badge on the engine goes missing 
The seat is ripped - new one has to be bought 
Have to pick up the car instead of having it dropped round like they should 
Water from the engine, straight after the service, gets into the headlights. 
When we went for the new seat they said they hadn't ordered it yet - after 2 weeks 

Considering we have only had the car for a less than 2 years this is awful. In the JD Power survey for customer satisfaction VW were one of the lowest marques and we acn see why. If we buy another VW we are getting it serviced elsewhere. ( If anyonelse agrees leave a comment ). 

In a few months time we could be taking order of a new car. It now has to be an estate and a diesel. My Dad hates diesels but I have desperately tried to convince him that they are getting better. We dont know what is on the list but I have a very good idea... 

VW Passat 
Renault Laguna II 
Vauxhall Vectra 
Ford Mondeo 
Nissan (Infiniti G20 in the US)Primera 
Volvo S40 
Citroen C5 

If anybody owns these cars as an estate or sallon or hatch than let me know as it would really help. Just leave a comment. ( Anybody who owns a diesel variant of these cars will be much obliged to tell me ) 

Overall the Passat is a great car. Its poor servicing prevents it from being better than the Audi A4 but it rates a close second. We will be looking very closely into the new Passat because it is a fantastic car.
