            Compared to the 95s and earlier, the 96 model was greatly improved. It has Ford's newer engine computer, the EEC-V and it is OBD-II compliant. It continuously monitors and adjusts the engine for optimum performance. No more frequent tune ups. This truck has the 100,000 mile tune up schedule. Previous years required more frequent maintenance. 

A very popular truck. Parts are inexpensive and easy to find. It drives and handles well, without the big truck feeling. The four cylinder engine is pretty weak. The 3.0 and 4.0 V6 are the best options.

The factory radio provides decent sound once I replaced the four speakers with higher quality aftermarket ones. A simple 30 minute task. The only reason I'd replace the stereo would be to install an MP3 capable CD player.

The factory paint and clear coat amaze me. It is still shiny. My neighbor thinks I wax this truck all the time. I waxed it maybe three times in the past 3 years. I don't "baby" it either. I go through the car washes at the gas stations about once every two weeks. Most of the time, I go through the ones with the brushes. Those brushless car washes just don't cut it. 

I have 71,000+ miles on it and it still looks good and is going strong.
