            We love our 1999 Forester that we bought new in May 1999 and have now owned for a year.  It handles like a dream!  Which means it corners beautifully, as opposed to feeling 'mushy' and unstable like a Ford Explorer does when you try to take a corner at a higher speed. In a Forester, you feel zippy with the 165 horsepower engine and totally in control as its handling makes you really grip the road, and that makes it safe.  Apparently, having a boxer engine means the engine can lie flat and lower, which makes the car have a lower center of gravity, which again makes handling superb and adds to safety (in a bad crash, the engine would crumple and go under the passenger compartment, not in it.).

It is excellent on wet pavement.  It can go nicely through snow.  The all wheel drive is better than 4 wheel drive in that it is always on and always ready to help you get out of a slip to pull/push you further on.

The Forester has huge head space, so you don't bang you head, and great leg room.  You can comfortably fit 5 adults, and you can add a sixth person in the cargo area if you must.

The Forester has excellent visibility, so when you are driving, you see so much of the road as compared to what you see driving a true SUV.

The crash tests are excellent for this car, and it has decent gas mileage.  Everything is right with this car, nothing is wrong.  Actually, the front cup holder's location is not ideal, but that is my only rant.

We've gone off road with this SUV, and on a nasty logging road with no problems.  We've driven over curbs, the Forester has enough clearance from the road to do that.  It is the best small SUV when compared to the Honda CRV (which has 20 hp less) or the Toyota RAV4 (which is ugly beyond words).  The Forester got better crash tests than both of them, and has more space than both of them, yet is essentially the same size.

My husband and I will probably replace our second car with another Forester when the time comes.<br><br>
