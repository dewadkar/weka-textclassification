            Chevrolet motored into the sport utility market with a solid background, then went ahead and downsized a reliable name i.e. &quot;Trailblazer&quot;, a somewhat reliable vehicle for hauling the groceries around or even taking the dog to the vet.

 I purchased my S-10 Blazer in &quot;98&quot; brand new, didn't even have road film on the tires, boy was it shiny, decided on the &quot;VORTECH 4.3 V-6&quot;, I was tired of those four bangers and had heard these little sixes could deliver when asked. The love affair began, running as smooth as a well oiled watch.

 I have travelled from OHIO to MONTERREY, MEXICO and all points in between, some for pleasure some for business, gas mileage was what I would consider to be just below average for this size of vehicle, but that little Blazer held the road and was a comfort to drive, no excessive road noise and rough roads seemed to float under my wheels at highway speed, and passing trucks, that was a real pleasure right up to the point where the speed governer kicked in and it started to buck like a mare in heat, what was this I thought to myself.

 This little powerhouse has a limiter that activates around, well errr, lets say between 92 and 100 mph, no confessions here folks!, this is when I noticed that although my blazer has great take off power, it can't run with the big dogs after about 60mph, even the Ford Explorer, slow on take off, walks away after 60mph, Nissan, Toyota, Honda all have that desired effect when you reach 60 and need to go just a bit faster. I don't understand why Chevy would do this, a Fine Sport ute in it's own right but underpowered from the get go. the seating is some what comfortable and leg room is better than I expected (front and rear), I'm over 6 ft and can sit in either for extended periods with out needing the jaws of life to get out.

I am impressed by the ability of this vehicle in bad weather, it handles similar to a small car, but watch the tire wear, tire rotation is a must in accordance with maintenance schedules

 All in all a pretty good &quot;MACHO&quot; station wagon and depending on either the four door or the two door, the options packages are what sell this vehicle. Do you need the Chevrolet Blazer?, I can't answer that. Did I need the Chevrolet Blazer? yes! and although it does have some shortcomings it can still handle my family of four on those seventeen hour road trips and I feel confident that the little Blazer that could, Does! <br><br>
