            30,000 miles and she still runs like new.  Much like Toyota, you can expect as few problems as possible.  3.000 mile oil check and the oil is not only still full, but it is spotless as well.

For under $15,000 you get a sporty looking car that could pass for a family joy ride vehicle, or a night out to the opera car.  The inside is roomy, unless you are an adult sitting in the back seat over five feet tall.  

If the front passengers are over five feet and have to sit with the seat further back then there is even less room in the back.  

Four adults can ride comfortable for a short road trip, say four hours or so.  If your trip requires a longer ride than that, then in no way should you take on five.  

It does not come with many standard features, which is okay considering the functionality of the items it does come with.  

The air conditioning and heat work more than well.  In winter I find myself turning it off and maintaining heat all the way to work.  The same goes for summer time.  The lowest setting on the air conditioner can keep the car ice cold.  

It is a no smoking car, so if you require that little heating unit that you push in, you have to request it.  Either that or the dealer forgot to give me one, but I don't smoke, so I don't really care. 

The sound system is great for a car.  I wouldn't consider getting another system, except maybe to put in a CD player, but as far as quality of sound and volume capability, it needs no assistance.  

The hubcaps are sweet for people who like the finished look on the car.  I've seen all the colors on the road, and I would have to give the award to the forest green color.  It just looks more sleek in that color. 

Trunk space is good.  The spare tire and the jack that it comes with fits under the board for the trunk without a hump, so it does not effect what you put in the back.  I can pack in quite a bit back there and still have room.  Even under the board, I have stored all of my emergency equipment and tools and stuff, and it's still pretty roomy down there.  

It's a fun car to drive.  The handling is really good, and it has a really good turning radius for an everyday kind of car.  It is not made to be a sporty car, but she can hold her own on a turn, and has a really good response to wheel play.  

For a four cylinder engine the pick up is really good, as long as you don't let off the brake and then try to floor it while you are going uphill.  No car really cares for that anyway, so it's not a big deal. 

Gas mileage is really good.  I get in the upper twenties for city and the upper thirties for highway.  Exceptional with the rise of gas prices.  It's a thirteen gallon tank, so I can last almost a whole week in heavy traffic commuting for less than twenty dollars a tank.  

My favorite feature would have to be the lights.  They automatically adjust to suit the light quality of the outside.  Besides the daytime running lights, your lights brighten if dusk were to befall you while driving.  Also, when you turn your lights on, if you forget, a soft alarm goes off when you open your door to remind you to turn them off.  A feature I've grown to value very much with my forgetful habits. 

The seats are really comfortable, and the seat belts don't choke you like some cars do.

Driver's side and passenger's side air bags come standard.  An awesome feature, but that means no children in the front seat.  But that's made up for by the three across the shoulder straps so that children can sit in any of the three back seats.

It's got a cute outside, and the lights give it that luxury car look.  I still get asked if it's a Lexus, even though they see the Toyota logo on the front.  

As usual Toyota's services keep your car purring like a kitten.  Not that there are any problems with it, but it comes with a bunch of free items to ensure total satisfaction.
