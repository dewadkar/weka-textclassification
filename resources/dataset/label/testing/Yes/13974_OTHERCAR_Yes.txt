            	I think the dodge viper is the best car in the world. It is a better sports car then the Chevy Corvette and is quicker then it too. No car can beet the Dodge viper in a race because it can go from 0-60 in only 3.5 seconds. My favorite type of Dodge Viper is the Rt/10, the Gts/r is beautiful too and is the fastest but it is a hard top. It is a beautiful car and it is fast too. Most of the people I know, say that the Dodge viper is their favorite car and they would prefer that car over any other. The Dodge corporation is my favorite, they make beautiful cars and I love them. I love the Dodge Ram, Dakota, and Also the Durango. They are beautiful cars. But if you were to buy a sports car with a price range
around $55,000-$115,000 dollars, I prefer the Dodge Viper. <br><br>
