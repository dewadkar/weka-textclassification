            I bought my QV-11 about 3 years ago when they were running about $300 (amazing how the price drops so dramatically on consumer electronics). I chose it pretty blindly, mainly because it was the best priced digital on the market at that time. The features seemed adequate for what I had in mind - photographing my jewelry line for selling on the online auctions.
I have to say it did the job, and the macro feature was just the thing  for the close up photography I was doing.
I must say, that I no longer use my camera for my jewelry auction photos - having gone to scanning the items instead - mainly because of the much better lighting and resolution a scanner provides (I also found a decent scanner for $69 at Office Max - but that's another review).
I do have one complaint about this camera though - it takes POOR people pictures. For some reason unless the lighting is perfect, people come out with dark shadows around their features and don't even look like themselves (which disturbed more than just a few of my photography subjects). I DON'T recommend this camera for that purpose.
Things yes - people no.
All in all - I feel this is a good utilitarian product for the cost. All in all - a good value.
