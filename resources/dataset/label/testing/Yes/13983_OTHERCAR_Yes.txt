               We always bought American cars, and many were very good. My husband was 
forever under the cars for one reason or another, in to the dealer the car went for some silly repair of ... you name it.    Our daughter  -- who knows nothing about cars -- had purchased two Honda Accords and never really did much of anything to or for her Accords.  We decided that maybe she had a better idea, or maybe a better product than her father and I had purchased; so we bought one.  The same luck came to us: no repairs and reliability that we had never experienced.  No more &quot;under the car&quot; stuff for us or her dad.
   The Honda Accord is great for its simplicity: simple and rounded body curves make it easy to clean or to wash. The controls inside are again simple and easy to get at.  It has four cylinders for great gas mileage: always in the low 30's or high 30's. It is not, however, and easy car to step into -- lots of stooping.
    But then, again, its lowness to the ground makes for fabulous road-hugging.  We've driven around many deer, while others behind have hit the deer or nearly rolled over in the act of swerving.
    If you buy this car, you will be buying a car which nearly every car has copied in many ways.
