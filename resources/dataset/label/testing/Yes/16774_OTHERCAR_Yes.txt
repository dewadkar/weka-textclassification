            I have mixed feelings about my 1994 Mazda minivan. On one hand, it rides and handles more smoothly than the cars I have owned. On the other hand, problems such as door handles breaking off and noisy valves have been an ongoing irritation. But a minor irritation when I compare them with the 107,000 problem-free highway miles I have subjected the vehicle to.
	I purchased my MPV for $7,500(a steal!) from a private party in 1997. At the time it already had 65,000 miles on it, so I knew that there would be some engine parts needing replacement fairly soon. I have kept up on the factory-recommended servicing and had no engine problems. The only complaint I have about the engine is the excessive valve noise that seems to come and go. It�s something you don�t want to hear in the middle of the Oregon desert, a hundred miles from a service station. 
	My problems have been with the exterior of the vehicle. It almost seems to have been made at a different plant than the chassis and engine! First, my right-side mirror broke off. The metal seemed to be low-grade and just broke at a weak spot. Then, my rear hatch lock fell apart, which was strange considering I almost never used the rear hatch! I tried to fix it myself but gave up after twice pulling the panel off and reassembling the mechanism inside. And shortly thereafter the driver-side door handle broke off; the same weak-metal problem as the mirror. I still haven�t fixed it. I guess I�m afraid to find out how much it would cost!
	Okay, based on the above you would think I dislike my MPV? Wrong, because I think the positives far outweigh the negatives.Take the ride, for example. It has the feel of a comfortable car with the sleight height advantage of a truck, and it handles the curves and corners with more stability than my Aerostar ever did. It seems to have the turning radius of a small car; I can pull a U-turn on the narrowest of roads with room to spare. And it has an amazing amount of power for a six cylinder. I have no problem passing anyone, even on hills.
	For the price, it has been the best vehicle I have ever owned.<br><br>
