            The E36 M3 is a fantastic Driving School and Lapping Day track car that also doubles as a great daily driver.  The car has plenty of power and handles like it's on rails.  I bought my M3 after owning a 1994 E36 325iS.  I drove an M3 at a Driving School and had to own one.  The car is one you look forward to driving every day and can take to the track and really experience its true potential.  Everything about this car screams performance; engine, transmission, suspension, brakes, and steering.  The car is extremely reliable even when driven to its limits in a track environment.  I have driven mine over 57,000 miles of which at least 5000 miles are track miles.  The car is bullet proof.  I've replaced the radiator and the water pump, both of which were track driving failures.  Would I buy another M3? You betcha!<br><br>
