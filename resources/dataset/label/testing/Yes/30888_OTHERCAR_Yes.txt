            This little SUV truck is fun to drive, great for stashing snowy ski or snow gear quickly, hospitable to two dogs, easy to clean (except for console), and a delight to look at (once you get used to it).  It handles well in the snow, even on back roads to the trail head, going up hill and breaking trail.  You can put a mountain bike in it upright, just walk it right in.

I think Honda meant the Element for 20 year old lads. I am a 55 year old female. Ha ha, Honda. Here in the mountain country of south central Montana, the car is selling to people between 35 and 80, and most of them female. There are 6 of them in a town of 6800 people. 

It is great for car camping, although a little short on stowage room. If you plan it right and put your gear in bags or containers that will fit under the back seatback when it is folded down for sleeping, then you can just move the containers under your "bed" when it is sleeping time. Or get rooftop storage (which I chose not to do since it ruins the fun lines of this boxy vehicle with the neat curved roof).  It's so easy to fold down the seats, take out the sleeping bag, sleep relatively comfortably, and then just scoot up into the driver's seat, upright the seatback, and drive away for an early start. Then when it is light out again, pull over and re-fit the cargo area and stash your gear for the day.

Minor flaws: rear bumper could be larger, less sloped. Can't even set down a cup of coffee on it. Console between driver and passenger is low enough to make it easy to reach into back (good), but impossible to clean (bad). If it had a liner that popped out for cleaning or a lid, that would be perfect.  Overall, storage compartments could be a little better thought out.  Otherwise a perfect vehicle.
