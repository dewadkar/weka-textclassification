            This is a good product but it does have it's limits. The camera is small and to easy to use. The LED's are clear and the the menu is easy to read and understand.
However the disc capacity is very limited if your going to use this on vacation or for family outings.  For quick work related jobs(like the real estate agent) this is a good choice, it's inexpensive, quick and will take pictures under various lighting conditions.
The programs that come with it are not very user friendly and require a bit experimenting but they will do the job.  I'm finding that programs I already had are easier to use.
Another draw back is the power drain- this unit eats batteries.
Over all I am happy with the camera and do recommend it just understand it's limits and work around them<br><br>
