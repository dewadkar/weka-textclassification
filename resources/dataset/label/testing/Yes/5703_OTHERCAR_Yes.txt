            I drive a lot and I need a car that is durable and handles well in a bad weather. I love the way my Altima handles in a heavy rain and in the snow. It is also very comfortable which is important if you are on the road driving 3 or 4 hrs per day. It is also a pretty smooth, quiet ride - not exceptional, but acceptable.
I wish that the next model would not have such a bulky look. It could be a bit more stylish. What I am missing are the lights on the mirrors located on visors. Serious problem for women, especially business women. No way to put your lipstick on.
This car is great for the money you pay. Your basic working horse.
Back seats are also very comfortable if you drive a lot with passengers. Rear seats can be folded down and it gives plenty of room for transporting large items. 
 I am leasing my second Altima and had no mechanical problems ever with either one.<br><br>
