            Yep, I'm one of them.  Part of the twenty to thirty something that the Xterra is marketed towards.  And guess what, you got it, also a proud owner.  
This vehicle was purchased in order to fill the void that my Honda CBR or my Nissan 240sx could not fill, the need for room.  Being an avid outdoorsman (surfing and diving here in Hawaii) and the proud owner of a Golden Retriever that travels everywhere with me I needed to expand.
When I began shopping, I knew my limits (about 25,000 absolute max).  Anyone else who has purchased an SUV lately has found this a nearly impossible goal to meet.  I found myself looking at Jeep Cherokees, Honda CVR's (yuck), RAV 4's (double yuck), pickups with a topper, or the Xterra.  Being that the Xterra was still being market tested when I purchased, I do not know if retail has increased.  However, when I was shopping the Jeeps and the Xterras were the LEAST expensive SUV's and the same price as a dang truck.  So this narrowed the field.  The Jeep being the old reliable and never changing entity it is, failed to stir the soul and promote interest.  
The Xterra had fresh styling and bold aggressive looks.  The test drive went well, and even brought a smile to ones face.  The initial look around the cabin is not show stopping.  The colors match well, but are not impressive.  A closer look shows some cheezy attributes such as the plastic molding around the A/C vents, and the flimsy plastic around the console.
A look under the hood is at first a little disturbing.  It just seemed very excentric and messy.  Several exposed wires everywhere, little fit and finish, it all seemed a little rushed to be designed and assembled (in contrast my 240SX was carefully assembled for a clean look).  The six cylinder it houses however is more than ample to push the Xterra along.   The Mountains and mud are no problem to be conquered.
A few other things that I like; seats are water resistant, back seats are comfy, roomy, and fold down flat, running boards are impracticle but very cool, the same styling of the roof rack is actually practicle, rear seats sit higher than the front.
A few things I dislike; stupid darn rear seat cushions have to be removed for the back rests to fold down, cheap plastic moldings, lack of attention to detail when it homes to certain things such as the engine compartment, and they still try to sell you the floormats seperately for 75 bucks A PIECE (hold out until they throw them in at least).
In all, the Xterra has been a great vehicle for the price with a tried and true engine and chassis platform(frontier pickup).  In the next few years I'm sure they will perfect the details, put the price will surely increase as it already has.<br><br>
