            This is one of the few cars I've seen which can live up to some of the expectations we've had of cars for today. Not the kind of expectations which put us behind the wheel...or stick...of flying jetsons cars, but the real predictions of where automotive transportation would take us.


If you've driven an older car, it doesn't even have to be that old perhaps just from the early 90's, then you've driven a 99 or 00 model you can feel the difference. Not necissarily just because it's a new car, but because everything comes much easier.

My car is a '92 Geo storm. Not the best of cars certainly but it always gets me where i want to go. Unfortuanetly the site won't let me write a review on that, but on the bright side it means i get to tell you about how wonderful this car is.

In the past people have complained that it has a bad blind spot, but the many times i have driven this car (and believe me many is the word) i have never come across any problem in the cars visibility that any other car wouldnt have. In fact i find dodge cars in general to have exceptional visibility.

Compared to cars of the same price or type from other companies the visibiliy these vehicles offer is amazing. Beyond that, as i was saying before, the car is just easier to use in almost every way. That is what i ment in the beginning of this epinion.

Throughout time cars have gotten more and more convienient and easy to use, for a while there were no real inovations in this department. But with the year 1999 came a whole slew of new ways to make driving easier and better for everyone involved.

Even without being a luxury car the intrepid is able to show off how driving can be made easier with mew innovations. Everything from just a better layed out driver's area to great steering and great response from the accelerator go into making this car a downright pleasure to drive.

If you are a faithful-four-door owner certainly next time it comes time for a new car go to this first and check out the years model before even looking at another. However on the down side, it's not very realistic as a first car. First off because it is rather large for a four door car and it's best for somene to start out driving something small making most manuvers much easier.

Secondly because of the price. Not a good first car since the only new models arent going to be at the used car lots, just on the road. Otherwise you'll have to buy one of the old taurus looking intrepids which don't even compare.

In short i recommend this highly to anyone who wants a four door car you can have some fun with and still not destroy your bank accounts. But for those of you looking for a first car or a cheap car i recommend reading some of the reviews of the dodge neons.<br><br>
