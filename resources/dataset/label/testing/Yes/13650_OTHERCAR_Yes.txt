            We bought our 1998 Kia Sportage in October of 1998.  It's really been a great little truck.  We get stopped all the time by people asking how we like it, etc.  We have the 4-door base model (sticker price was about $18,000) and have had no real problems with it.  We did have to replace the battery in December, 1999.  But other than that there have been no mechanical problems at all.  It drives nicely and possibly the only complaint I have is that it can be difficult to shift into 4wd.  You really have to put some muscle into it!  I would definitely recommend the Kia Sportage to anyone that is considering a smaller sized SUV such as the Toyota RAV4 or the Suzuki CRV.  Happy driving! <br><br>
