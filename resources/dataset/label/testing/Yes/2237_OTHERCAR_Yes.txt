            I bought my SL with almost all of the available options.  AMG sport package with 18" wheels and Dunlop SP9000 tires, multicontour heated seats, xenon lights, fiber optic CD changer, built in phone, etc.  The body was slightly updated in 1999, the taillights look sleeker and much nicer, the exhaust was changed to an oval twin exhaust (looks very trick), the dash was redesigned.  It actually looks very similar until you look at them side by side.  The old dash had all of the guages mounted together with one piece of clear plastic covering them.  The new design has individual guages with bezels around each one.  Looks far nicer!  The HVAC controls were updated to the newer style but still lacks separate temp controls for driver and passenger.  A huge oversight in my opinion.  A car of this price should have separate temp controls.  The door panels were also redesigned.  They look much sleeker and nicer than the pre 1999 models.  The sport package was pricey but well worth the cost.  It became standard for 2001 which was a blow to people who paid $5000 for it the year before.  The only difference is that you don't get the little sport badges just aft of the front tires on the lower panels.  The sport package consists of the front air damn with black grates covering the openings, side skirts, rear skirt and the huge 18" AMG wheels.  The downside to getting the sport package is that the front air dam tends to scrape on entry and exit of steep driveways.  Also, the low profile tires 275/35/18 in the rear are a little harsh and tended to flat spot.  At least mine did.  I took my car in 4 times in the first 2 months of ownership to rebalance the tires because of the wobbling.  If you let the car sit in the garage, it will flat spot the tires.  The car is just too damn heavy.  The last thing that was changed for 2000 or 1999, not quite sure which year it was introduced, was the engine.  They put the 305hp 3 valve V8 that was designed for the new S-class.  It is an awesome motor that just pulls and pulls.  It is super quiet and very torquey.  The drawback is the weight of the car.  It still accelerated briskly but I'm sure it would do better if it weighed about 1000 lbs less.

The top worked great but a little slow for my tastes.  Still, very high quality.  Listen to the top mechanism in the SL (solenoids etc) compared to a BMW or a Porsche 996.  The Mercedes is much quieter and solid feeling whereas the others use electric motors.  The hardtop latches and unlatches at the push of a button.  Totally hands free.  I purchased a hardtop hoist made by Sto-Away that worked very well with the SL top.  Highly recommend that product.

The one drawback to the car is it's dated electronics and cowl shake.  The design debuted in 1991 so it's not surprising but it is surprising for a Mercedes.  I did not anticipate that problem but it was there.  The car feels totally different with the hardtop on than it does with the softtop closed.  The other thing is that the softtop is very noisy.  It is basically canvas with a thin headliner for looks.  Almost no noise insulation.

Still a great car and I still love it!  The sport package makes the car look agressive and it still gets looks and comments.  Silver with ash interior is the best color combo!
