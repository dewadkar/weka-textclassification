            We use three factors in determining which car to purchase, its main function, durability of the last 2 years model, and how much we wanted to be in debt over the car.  After studying and contemplating when and what car to purchase, my husband and I settled on the 2000 Honda Civic LX.  We had actually narrowed down our choices for a basic commuter car between a Corolla and the Civic.  The Civic won.  Both vehicles are comparable in price, but the Civic was a lot more comfortable to ride, to drive in and more versatile.  I have to admit though the 2000 Corolla did have a peppier engine.  We approached some of my co-workers who had purchased the 98 and 99 models and asked them how they felt about their Civics and unanimously they all said they were very satisfied. Since we have only own this car for 2 weeks, we have not seen any major or minor problems with the car.  

We live on a hill so we wanted to stick to a manual transmission for the extra pull up the hill.  Funny thing we discovered is most people in the SF Bay Area prefer an automatic....must be the traffic jams.  The engine is a 4-cylinder 1.6 liters, so it would great on fuel efficiency.  We had no problems with acceleration on freeways, but like what Astrid has mentioned in her review, the car is slightly wimpy on the hill climbs.  

We enjoyed the quiet ride and we had no problems fitting 4 adults in the car.  Luckily my husband and I are under 5�6�, so the guests sitting in the rear did not complained.  I really appreciate the tight turning radius the Civic can do.  Design of the interior is very functional and I had no problems reaching for anything.  Unfortunately the two cup holders are located in the front and there are none in the back.  The trunk is spacious and becomes more spacious when the rear seats are folded down to give the trunk extra space.  We would have preferred a full size spare tire instead of the �donut� that is available.

We would highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an entry-level car (car dealer lingo for one of the more affordable car in its line).  The Civic has been a real joy to drive and I am looking forward in keeping this car for a long time.  However, the Civic is not a car for someone to stand out in the crowd.  I felt like every third car in a shopping mall lot or on a college campus lot is a Civic.
