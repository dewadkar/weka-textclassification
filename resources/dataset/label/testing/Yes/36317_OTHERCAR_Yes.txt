            I purchased a 2003 Infinity G35 sports sedan about 10 weeks ago. It's silver, with a black leather interior, moonroof, sports suspension package and Bose stereo. I wrote my first review, just days after taking delivery, and in retrospect, I feel I didn't do the car the justice it deserves. After spending more time behind the wheel, I now believe I can give a fair, accurate report. Much of my initial impressions are still valid. The car has incredible power, awesome handling and spectacular brakes. The seats are really comfortable and the car looks just great. But one of the nicest things about the car is the sound. The engine has the warmest purr at low speeds (not too loud, not too soft) and a tremendous roar when you nail it. I really enjoy just putting down the windows, opening the moonroof and just cruising. However, in my initial review, I felt the sports package made the ride too firm. But in hindsight, I believe it's just right. My former car had a much softer suspension and I when I first began driving the G35, I wasn't used to the ride. After several weeks, the car's ride now feels fine. It is firm, but nicely so, and not too jarring. I was also not too kind to the Bose stereo. But with some adjusting, I was able to get a really clear, crisp sound. You just have to crank it up. I still have some small gripes though. The ergonomics of the stereo and climate control systems are just plain confusing and difficult to adjust while you're driving. And one aspect of the car's operation is, in my opinion, somewhat dangerous. When you start the car, the dash lights up automatically. During the day, no problem. But at night, it gives you the impression that your headlights are on when they aren't. (with every car I've ever driven, the dash lights come on when you turn on your headlights) The first time this happened to me I was pulling out of a parking lot at night and just about got nailed. It's really something Infinity should look into. All in all though, the G35 is a great car. Great looks, great performance and a great price. There's nothing wrong with that.
