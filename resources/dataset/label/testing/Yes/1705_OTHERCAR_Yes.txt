            What a great looking SUV!  How do they make all of this room in here with such a small body?  Check out this little table in the back and the storage room under it!  Look at these cool arm rest and reclining rear seats for my kids as we ride to Wal Mart!

All of the above was my initial thoughts while checking out my soon to be CRV on the dealers lot.  My wife and I had been eyeing these cool little SUVs since they came on the scene in early 97.  This was mid 98 and it was time to buy!  I went inside to get the keys from the dealer and my wife and myself took off.  Well we left for a ride, I don't think &quot;took off&quot; fits the description of a ride in this little SUV.  

I just don't understand the engineers of this car.  I admit that I don't know it all, but if I had just designed a cool car like this I would have insisted on it having a motor that had just a little kick to it.  To get this thing to do anything in reference to the word &quot;quick&quot; you need to nail it and tach it up good.  If you don't mind taching it up all of the time then you should be able to live with this motor.  It is just lacking torque.  Honda made up for this poor little motor's faults by attaching a very intelligent automatic transmission to it.  What I mean by saying that this cars transmission is intelligent is the fact that it really knows when to gear up or down.  When going down steep declines it knows to down shift for you.  When climbing hills it down shifts just like any other auto trans but it really understands that you should not shift back up until you reach the top of the hill.  What I mean here is referring to the way some auto transmission cars will gear down then as you speed up a little it will gear right back up then it realizes that it geared up too soon so it gears back down again and so you just gun it cause you get tired of the gear shifting.  Well this Honda doesn't have this problem.  It makes the most out of that wimpy little motor.  

Okay, now back to my test drive and life there after with the CRV.  I can't believe how easy and sharp this thing turns.  I let my father drive it one time and he said that it felt like driving a go-cart.  This is a compliment totally.  It is so easy to park or jump around in tight traffic, and yes even though it lacks torque badly it will hop around very well in tight city traffic.  Just tach it up!  The car is a little top heavy but you can live with it knowing that the trade off is plenty of head and storage room.  Braking is very good.  I have antilocks on my CRV and they work very well.  The All Wheel Drive and Antilocks make it a great snow vehicle.  The stereo is satisfactory and the Air Conditioning is very good.  It is still a mystery to me how there is so much room in these cars, but it parks easier than any other car that I have ever driven.  What I feel this car is lacking besides power is a passenger arm rest and lumbar support for the folks in the front.

I highly recommend the CRV to those wanting a small sport utility.  Gas mileage is around 25 MPG.  The good far out weighs the bad here.  I bought this car with 14K miles on it and it now has 47K and it has not given me any problems so far.  I plan to hang on to this car because of the good gas mileage, Honda's great reliability reputation, the way it accommodates my two children, and most of all...because my wife likes her CRV.  She doesn't care that it is so slow.

While all is happy within my home with the CRV on the carport I will always wonder why those highly educated engineers forgot the passengers arm rest, forgot lumbar support for the front seats, and left so many of the horses out grazing that really could have been of better use under the hood of this cool ride.<br><br>
