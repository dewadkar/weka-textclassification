            This car is a nice balance between comfort and function.  Its potential for holding around nine passengers makes it ideal for large families or long road trips.  Ford has really added a nice touch to their already dominant lineup of light trucks.  It comes standard with dual airbags and antilock brakes, and for the additional safety a possible side airbag feature can be added.  A downfall to this vehicle may be the output of 5.4-liter engine.  It produces only a 10 second 0-60, which is slower than the Vortec engines in GM models.  The rear sonar system and the adjustable pedals are the two main improvements made to the 2000.  A sensor at the rear of the vehicle beeps when it is backing up and getting close to objects within 5 feet.  Another advantage to the Expedition is that it is a lot easier to maneuver than the Suburban or other full length SUVs.  I would recommend this to everyone interested in a large comfortable SUV.<br><br>
