            I bought this car used, because it seemed like a relatively good car for a relatively low price. Well, I've been driving it for awhile, and it is a good car! It has almost 200,000 miles on it, and It still drives comfortably. Well, I have had to replace a few things, like the alternator went out once, and one hot summer my air conditioner died. But other than that, as long as the car is kept tuned up and definately not neglected, it will last for quite awhile. One bad thing is definately the noise level. If you don't mind car noise, then you will love this car. It tends to make lots of noise, but if you turn the volume up on the good factory radio system, you will not even notice! Overall, This car would be best for teenagers, or young adults. The car is a little small, so it does not have the comforts of a luxury car. But it sure does meet all the needs I have!<br><br>
