                 The 1996 Cutlass Supreme IV is a good car, and it was a good deal for the money.  It is seen a old persons car.  I can get up and go.  You can be any age to enjoy the power of this car.  With leather, power roof, antenna, doors, windows and cruise, the Cutlass is s good solid car at a good price.  Now that I have said the good, there is one bad.  At 17,000 mile, it had to have a new transmission.  It frozen together.  It was stuck in 1st gear.  It took a week in the shop, and a new transmission, we were back on the road.  I read the transmission was one of GM's best transmission.  We haven't had a problem with the new transmission.  We are at 42,000.  If you can find a used one, I would recommend buying it.  You will enjoy the car and the car should be reliable and with you for sometime.  <br><br>
