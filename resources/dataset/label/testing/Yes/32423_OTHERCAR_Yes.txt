            Have you ever read the story of a little engine that could? That's how this Honda Civic was on my last spring break trip. This car is a great spring break car because of it's good gas milage and it's decent packing space. 

While this car isn't the most powerful car around, it's good enough to whatever a college student such as myself would need to get done. It comes with everything I need, such as a cd player, AC for warm weather, and good gas milage which is the most important for a starving student such as myself. 

I have never had any problems with this car whatsoever mechanically. The only problem I had was when I was on a dirt road and didn't see that there was a huge ditch in the going across the middle of the road. Even after hitting that the car held up well. 

I think that overall if you know that this is the type of car that you're looking for then this is the top of that class (inexpensive compact car).
