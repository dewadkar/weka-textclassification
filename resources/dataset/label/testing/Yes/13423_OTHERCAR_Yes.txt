        About one year ago we needed a passenger vehicle and were looking to buy a minivan, then my Stepfather had a friend who was selling a 1996 chevy blazer, my Mother instantly thought oh no this gas milage is going to put a hole in my pocket, but she was very wrong, we averaged 19 miles a gallon on city conditions, and 23 on highway conditions. It is great during the winter. It is a safe way of traveling, and it is stylish and sporty appearence. We had bought it from him with a custom paint job. The seats are very comfortable, and the ride is soft and smooth. It has never threatened to rollover on us, and it has been very reliable.The engine is a strong, quick, and responsive v6 vortec engine.It can get my Step Fathers small honda out of a ditch in the snow, without having to use the inteligent 4x4 system.We have never had to repair it and the engine and body are very low maintenence. The stereo system also sounds better than any car I have been in. I would highly reccomend this vehicle to anyone who has a family, lives alone, has a pet, or lives in an off road terrain.
