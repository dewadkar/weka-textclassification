            I purchased my model year 1994 Isuzu Rodeo on December 27, 1994. It is the base model S, with a manual transmission. I have now been driving it for a little over five years. Overall I am very pleased. I bought my Rodeo new, and at the time of writing it now has nearly 110,000 miles behind it.

I drive this great SUV all over. I live in San Jose, CA and routinely drive to Los Angeles, Lake Tahoe and all over the Bay Area. I have also driven my Rodeo to eastern Canada and back, twice. It has been a super vehicle on all the long trips as well as local traffic. I have an extremely short commute to work, so the vast majority of driving has been on my long road trips, which often include journeys of 200 miles or more nearly every weekend.

THINGS I LIKE:

*Very roomy. Lots of leg room up front and also in the back. I am six feet tall and I am always comfortable both as driver and passenger.

*Reliable. I have had no major mechanical problems at all. It's only off the road for routine oil changes, tune-ups and the like.

*Nice to drive. The perfect SUV in my opinion. Fairly small for a SUV, so it drives and handles like a car making for ease fitting into parking spaces and it fits nicely into my garage. Corners well too. As an SUV it also gives you good cargo room and a good view of the road ahead. My Rodeo does not have 4WD or a tow package however. 

THINGS I DISLIKE:

Nothing much to complain about here, as I had a choice between the base model S and the more upscale LS model, and I chose the S. If I could change a couple of things on the '94 model S it would be these;

* The radio was not standard so I had to buy it extra, but the location of the radio is low in the centre of the dashboard, so one has to hunch over and reach down to adjust it. This requires you to take your eyes off the road until you learn the button locations my memory. 

*Small engine. Only a 4.2 with 4 cylinders, which in 1994 was the only engine offered for the model S. Not much power when going over grades, especially with a full load. (Of course the small engine has fuel advantages and on long trips this benefit tends to outweigh the power issue.)

LITTLE THINGS HERE AND THERE:

Although nothing major has yet gone wrong after 5 years, here are some little things that have occurred;

The back-up lights stopped working about a month after I bought the truck. I returned to the dealership who quickly fixed the problem at no charge. However only three days later, the lights failed to come on when the truck was in reverse yet again. Once again the issue was quickly resolved, but only to have the lights again fail only 15 days later. I have since decided not to bother with the situation any further and have simply never had operational reverse lights for all these years. I have never had any problems because of this. 

The seatbelts for the driver and passenger seats do not recoil back into position when released very well anymore. This is a new problem which has just shown up within the last 2-3 months. It's not a major issue but the belts hang down outside the door if you don't manually pull the belt and help it recoil back to the neutral position when exiting the truck.

All of the dashboard lights have failed in the last month (Feb. 2000) which made night driving a little more interesting. There are two bulbs in there, and one went out before the other. First only one half went dark, then a week later the second bulb burnt out. With the dashboard black you cannot see the fuel level or speedometer at night. After five years I know my speed and know when to switch gears and I am always in the habit of never allowing the fuel drop below a quarter tank, so running out of fuel was not a concern. This problem was more of a nuisance then a hazard. I had the problem fixed by a friend of mine for minimal cost.

The spare tire is mounted on the inside of my SUV. Occasionally it comes a little loose and rattles while driving. This problem is very quickly and easily solved by tightening the screw holding the spare tire in place. It is very easy to access and takes no effort.

There is nothing else to report. I love my SUV very much and would not hesitate to buy another one.
