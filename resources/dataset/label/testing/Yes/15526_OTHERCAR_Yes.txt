            Recently while vacationing in Las Vegas I rented a Chrysler Sebring.  I had no idea what to expect but let me tell ya, it was the greatest car I ever drove!  At home I have an SUV so being in a car that sits lower was hard to get used to, but once I got it on the open freeway with the top down.. I was sold!  The car had a lot of get up and go and seemed to handle well at both high speed and low speed.  The convertible top was easy to handle and very air tight on the freeway.  I am very tall and need leg room so I was a little concerned about that, but once I settled my rear into the seat, again.. I was sold.  The only problem I had was when I tried to take 4 other friends someplace.  Three of them (two who are VERY small) fit but were very uncomfortable in the back seat.  The other person in the passenger seat was tall and was unable to put his seat forward to help out with the room in back.  But, when my friends saw the looks that we got while cruising the strip in Vegas.. they seemed to forget all about how uncomfortable they were.. LOL.. :)  <br><br>
