            I'm a little ashamed to admit, I was first attracted to this camera by it's looks - boxy, "snub-nose", brushed metal, retro look. Beautiful.

After doing a lot of research on this camera, and reading the excellent reviews here by "mbfd316" and "keithw_2000", I made the purchase decision.

In it's price range, I really don't think there is a better camera. Before this, I've bought and used cameras by Olympus (three of them), Nikon (Coolpix), Sony (1st generation Mavica) and others. 

If you have Windows XP, setup is more automatic than you can imagine. Plug it in, XP finds it, identifies it as a "USB Storage" device, and installs drivers. You don't even need the supplied drivers (or software). Please make sure to click the "Remove Hardware" icon in your system tray and "stop" this "USB Device" before unplugging it. The world won't end if you forget this, but it sure won't hurt.

You are then given the choice of launching whatever image-editing software is in your computer & begin editing, or simply launch Windows XP's explorer to drag & drop photos. 

For Windows 98se, you may be asked to insert the supplied CD, then click enter to let Windows find and install the driver. 

Some of the reviews I read around the internet on this camera complained of less than stellar performance in low light. I have found this to be at least as good as most or many digital cameras in this category. I even tested it under "no light", by putting it on a tripod at night and taking a  photograph of a city skyline. The photograph was great. 

ALL point-n-shoot cameras are going to have some limitations in poorly-lit, indoor settings. Any camera that attempts to use a tiny, built-in flash will inevitably encounter limitations ... particularly, digital; you just have to remember to keep your subjects WELL-lit for indoor photos.

Testing this camera indoors with existing light - I've found it to be passable, and no worse than what is "normal" in the Point-and-Shoot world.

Features - 

- I'll begin by saying that this camera has some great ones. Most notably, the ability to adjust your ASA / ISO settings. There is also a "forced-flash" or "fill flash" capability, as well as cancelling flash, and even a low-light sync mode ... which I tested in a night photo with great results.

- Adjustable white balance and manual adjustment to exposure compensation (from minus 1.5 to plus 1.5 in third-step increments) is GREAT for a camera in this price range. 

- Macro capability is outstanding here, I am amazed at how close, clear and sharp my extreme close-ups are. 

- Video Out. Having the Video Out capability means you can record your little clips and photographs to Video tape and send them to friends and relatives who don't even have a computer. 

Useability - 

This camera is EASY to use, in the automatic, point-and-shoot mode. Some will complain about the lens cap, just make sure you have it tethererd to the camera with the supplied cord, and you'll be alright.

Overall - 

I was amazed at the care with which this was packaged. It was definitely intended to be a quality offering and it is. The owner's manual is a BOOK; about an inch or two thick, and weighing nearly a pound. Detailed and informative!

BONUS - the Imaging Software supplied with this camera is "Image Expert", which you might also know as "After Shot", by the excellent people at JASC ... the people who bring you "Paint Shop Pro". Consider this a $49 bonus, it is excellent software made specifically with digital cameras in mind.

I've been printing up some OUTSTANDING 5 X 7 photographs of portraits, wild life and even night shots ... a few 8 X 10, but that costs a lot of money in ink.

The Costco where I live has a processing station where you bring in your smart media card and insert it ... select the photos you want printed, take your card back .. then come back to pick up your printed photos a few days later. Just as if you'd dropped off a roll of film. I tried this and am now HOOKED on it. What a fantastic benefit, and at only 24 cents per print!

My prints from the processsor were great. Maybe I just wasn't asking enough of the digital realm, but I've gotten much more than I'd expected with this camera. 

If you're considering the Fuji Finepix 2600 or the Canon Powershot A40, consider this one as well. I think this a near-equal, and in some cases better camera; and a MUCH better value.
