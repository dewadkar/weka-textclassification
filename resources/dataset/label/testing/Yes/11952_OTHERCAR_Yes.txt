            After years of owning Honda Civics and Nissan Altimas, my wife and I decided to step up (no pun intended) to a truck. Here's our take on this vehicle. 

I could not believe the ride quality over my Civic and my wife's fully optioned Altima GLE! This truck is so well balanced on the interstate that road noise is almost non-existant. The ride isn't nothing like I expected from a 4x4. NOTHING. It's quiet even with the largest tire combo that came factory with this truck (31" tall 265/70r16 Dunlops with alloy 5 spoke rims). Even though the Toyotas trucks have always seemed a bit lacking on sound deadening material, this truck is quiet and conversations can be carried on at a whisper.

The interior is placed right, my only gripes are the clock placement and the antiquated "e" brake location. I would have liked the "e" brake location to be in the center console and would have liked to see the clock in the radio face. I would also like to see the radio cluster higher so your eyes won't have to wander so far from the road. The white faced, red backlit gauges are very readable and frankly look very sporty but would have liked to see oil pressure and ampere gauges instead of "dummy lights". Overall, the dash layout is well proportioned and easy to read even at a quick glance.

Fit and finish were impressive as well. After going over this entire truck with a fine tooth comb (after taking delivery 7/18/02), the only thing I noticed loose was the license plate light socket. Not a biggie, I think it may have gotten loosened when the towing package was installed.

The V6 has loads of low end grunt and the automatic 4 speed shifts well without undo noises or shutter. I haven't really experimented with the electronically controlled shift points. I believe the difference between "power" mode and "normal" mode will be more evident after the truck is pulling a 3,000 lbs trailer. It cruises at 70-80 with very little wind noise or suspension recoil. I could easily drive for hours without getting uncomfortable, however if lumbar support is offered, I would try to get it, IMO. 

My wife and I were fortunate to be able to find a non-TRD packaged Tacoma since most 4x4's have this package. The TRD package has a bit stiffer suspension due to beefier Bilsten shocks which we didn't want. However, the TRD package incorporates the lock-up rear differential. I would have liked have the locking differential option on mine since I have heard nothing but good things about it. When the rear differential is locked, power is transferred to both rear wheels at the same time. If you get the 2wd Prerunner, this option would be a must if you live where snow is a possibility or you frequent mud/rock combinations.

I highly recommend this truck. It rides flawlessly (compared to other 4x4's I ridden in), the build quality is also flawless. Add all of these things up and then remember this is a Toyota. Toyotas have a long bloodline of strength, high mileage, and minimal problems.

I would recommend this truck to anybody. And no, I am not a Toyota dealer........ Just a very satisfied customer.
