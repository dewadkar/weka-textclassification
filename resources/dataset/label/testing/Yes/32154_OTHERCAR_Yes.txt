            When we were strapped for cash, but in need of a second vehicle, we checked out all the usual suspects, suzuki swifts, hyundai's and the lanos.  Basically the goal was a car that came with a warranty and we could afford.  

We found a Daewoo that had been repo'ed and had 12,000 km's on it... and still had the balance of the warranty and seemed to be in good shape. 

We've had it for about a year and half and used it as a commuter and the occasional "weekender" without complaints.  The engine runs quietly and smoothly, same for the tranny and the braking.  Once the hose that feeds the windshield air vents came off, but was easily fixed.  SO for reliability we'd have to give our 'woo high marks.

The car's interior is what you'd expect for the price.  Bare bones, but not brutal (similar to other cars in its class for sure) Amazingly, the seats have multiple dials and knobs for customizing the seat.  I've driven it for as long as 4 hours without major complaints.  The radio is very quiet and I'll upgrade it when this car becomes my commuter.
The hatchback is a great design, though the sill is a little high making unloading somethings troublesome.

With the warranty and the price, the woo does what you'd expect.
