            With the unexpected demise of our much beloved mitsubishi Expo my wife and I began searching for a replacement vehicle.  Unfortunately no one makes anything like the Expo anymore and the closest we found was the Mazda MPV.  Unfotunately the local Mazda dealership doesn't stock many and their sales staff represent the worst stereotype of salesmen you can imagine.

We already own a Plymouth Voyager so I didn't really want to look at another full size minivan (isn't that some kind of oxymoron).  Anyhoo like most of you minivan shoppers out there we rapidly found ourselves looking at the Odyssey and the Sienna.

The local Toyota dealer had about 30 sienna's yet even with that they weren't particularly willing to negotiate on price.  The LE model we were looking at was stickered at $26752 and they wouldn't budge below $25752.

I wasn't too impressed with the ride in the Sienna as I'm use to the Voyager with felt more stable and a little "Heavier".  My wife however like the sienna but before committing I wanted to try the Honda.

First impressions.  This is a very big car.  I didn't realise how much bigger than our voyage it was until I tried to get it into our garage.  Inside it is incredibly spacious.  I can just barely reach my daughter when she is sitting in the middle seats and I'm 5'10".  The rear cargo space is enormous even with the back seats up.  The depression in the back end is where the seats fold down into is real handy for groceries as it stops them slamming around inside the car.

The middle seats can be positioned together as a bench on separated into captains chairs.  The procedure is not as slick as that on the Mazda.  You have to pop out a couple of covers on the floor and then unlatch the seat and reposition it.  The middle seats can be removed completely if desired.

I love the rear seat arrangement.  Anyone who has had to struggle the "easy-out" seats from their dodge/plymouth minivan will truly appreciate this set up.  All you do is release two latches and the seat folds down into the floor.  You can even flip the seat backwards and use it to sit on with the tailgate open.

There are lots of little storage areas and holders for all sorts of things.  My wife and I particularly like the fold up tray table between the front seats.

The driving position felt just like our voyager which is mostly what sold me on the car.  The visibility is good and all the controls are easy to reach with the possible exception of the stereo volume control that gets hidden behind the gear shift when in drive.  Side mirrors are huge and give good rearward visibility.

On the road the car is incredibly stable and has very little body roll when cornering.  The turning circle is amazing for a car this size making it very easy to park.  The engine is very powerful and smooth.  I used to the voyager speedometer where the 12 oclock position is about 60 mph but on the honda its about 70 mph and with the power of this car you can get going a lot faster than you think in a short time.

We've only had the car a week and haven't driven it much yet so there may be things I've yet to discover.

Perhaps the biggest downside about the Odyssey is availability and pricing.  They are very hard to find on dealerships and they go for premium prices.  Conspiracy theorists chime in here.  There were extra markups on the sticker that made no sense to me they seem totally arbitrary.  We did in the end get the Vehicle for $24,500 which is what we were prepared to pay for the Sienna but overall more than I wanted to spend.

Not really a problem but unexpected was that the car has a little more road noise than I expected given Honda's reputation.  The engine is very quiet even under hard acceleration but the noise at freeway speeds is louder than I'd like, though quieter than our older voyager and about the same as the Sienna we drove.  This could just be a tire issue also.

The other problem is that I had to spend most of Sunday cleaning out the garage and moving shelves to the side wall so we could get this beast in and still have enough space to get around it.
