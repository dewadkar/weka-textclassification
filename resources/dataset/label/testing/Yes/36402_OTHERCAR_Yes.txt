            This is probably the nicest pickup truck I have owned. I did have some
           problems with the truck when I bought the truck new. I didn't have the truck
           home fifteen minutes when the truck just poured antifreeze from the
           firewall area of the engine compartment. It was an inconvenience to take it
           back to the dealer. At the factory the heater hose going to the firewall was
           not attached and clamped properly. The only other problem I've had was
           the front right wheel hub leaking grease after 5 months. The dealership
           made all the repairs under warranty. There are a few areas on the truck that
           the paint quality is lacking. But overall, compared to the new truck problems
           I've had with the new Fords and Chevrolets I've owned, and how they
           responded to the problems, I like the Dodge product. Everyone who has
           driven my truck wants one.
