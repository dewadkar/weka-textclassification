            I have owned a 1988 4 cylinder Caravan and a 6 cylinder Voyager, both standard vans.  Unfortunately, neither van could clear 80K without major engine or transmission troubles.
Needless to say, I was not enamored of  Chrysler's offerings.  I used Consumer Reports, to guide me through the usual thicket of offerings this time and went back to the basics for car buying, which I had tended to ignore in recent years.  Kelley Blue Book will give good information on the MSRP, options and some specifications (www.kbb.com).

I bought my Odyssey LX in December, 2000 for list, which was about $23,800.00 plus tax and license.   I had to wait it out three months before the dealer had one available and found it using the internet.  I bought mine from Autowest Honda in Fremont, California and they actually have an internet sales department.  They actually followed me during my search and they five Odesseys come in, which dwindled to two my the time I got there.  It didn't matter, they had the color and trim level I wanted most, so I was quite lucky.   (It is silver and an LX, hides dirt very well).  The other interesting feature of their internet department, is that I pre-negotiated to the point that I actually went down and did some more when I got there.  It was the usual conference, but I was well treated and I actually had a good time ribbing the sales guys about the negotiations. 

The handling and power of this van is very good.   It is quiet enough on certain roads that I find myself speeding.   Yes, it can go 110 mph, but 70 at 2000 rpm is my modus operendi.  I am averaging 19 mpg in town and about 24 on the road and about 20 overall.   It goes up hills without complaining and it give the BMW guys a second look.  The handling is very competent.  it took about two months  for me to believe that the Honda could be pushed harder than the Caravan.  The interior space is very similar to the standard Caravan and the hiding third seat is very nice.

The fit and finish on this car is extremely good.  It is clear that Honda Motor Company will not take a back seat to any manufacturer.   The rear air is great for or family herd of dogs, too.

I wish it power seats and a CD changer, but it's not a big deal.   The radio works quite well and I am more than satisfied with it.  I will get an aftermarket  CD changer for it, soon.

Even though it was new, my insurance rates did not go up.  It has antilock brakes, dual airbags, an anti-theft lock system and something call Traction Control system to help handling at low speed on slippery surfaces.   I have had one case where this TCS did go on and I couldn't tell what the true nature of the road was so  I presumed it worked.

If you looking for a van, I believe this is best of all choices in its class.  It's powerful, it's comfortable, it's easy to drive, it is very easy to enter and exit, the visibility is commanding,  it's reasonably economical,  it has real room for six real people, it has so many standard features, that what little an EX will give seems a little silly.  I intend to own this van for ten years and, with good maintenance and preventive maintenance, the Odyssey will very probably give me 150K of trouble free service.

So there you have it,  Consumer Reports to narrow the field of choices,  Kelley Blue book to guide me the options, none of which I picked,  and an internet savvy Honda dealer, Autowest Honda in Fremont ,CA to get a good price.   I feel I did a reasonable job in research and spent the appropriate time to achieve my goal of finding a "good" car.
