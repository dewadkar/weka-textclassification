            This is my first digital camera.I love it. Before I bought this camera I did allot of research on cameras and for the price range this one was highly recommended. That price range was $800-$1000. Imagine my reaction when I went down to Beach Camera(Greenbrook,NJ) and got it for $699! On top of that it comes with a bag,strap,digital film and software. The software is useless. The serial port cable is too slow. If you have a San Disk compact flash card reader you're good to go. The red eye thing is a problem but you can fix that with the software you normally use to print your photographs. My favorite feature is the video out jack. As soon as I get home I connect it to my TV and view the pictures right away in the living room with my family. The very first picture I took I got a picture of an orb! I love the way it twists! That's an eye catcher and it's so small you can stick it in your coat pocket. As far as the power consumption goes. You're better off buying rechargeable batteries because this camera overdoses on batteries! I got Radio Shack's Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries. They're good. The pictures this camera takes a great. I prefer not to use the flash as much as possible. The flash is so powerful it makes everybody look like a smoker. I also try not to take to many close-up shots because this camera is too accurate. It picks up every zit and mole on your face! I'm not kidding. <br><br>
