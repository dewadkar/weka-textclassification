              I received the Kodak EasyShare 4330 digital camera as a gift in Dec 2002.  This is my first digital camera, so all points listed will be through the limited experience of a virgin user.

  The camera cost $339 at Sam's Club and came with the camera dock II and a Ni-MH rechargeable battery pack.  

  The camera dock is an easy interface that connects to your computer through the USB port.  The dock serves the purpose of downloading your pictures to your computer and recharging the rechargeable battery.  
  
  Place the camera in the dock, press the button on the front, and the Kodak EasyShare program will automatically boot up and prompt you to download any pictures contained in the camera.  You will be given the option to have the pictures on the camera automatically deleted after they are saved on the computer.

  The camera is capable of shooting pictures in 5 different settings.  You will have the choice of using the auto feature, which will determine the best setting by examining the light and movement of the subject.  This setting is good for basic photos indoors or at stationary objects outside, but for better quality, I would suggest practicing with the other settings when the situation demands it.

  Other settings include the sport setting, for objects that are in motion.  The shutter speed is faster at this setting and the flash will fire if needed.  There is a night setting for night scenes or low light situations.  This setting is better used with a tripod or by placing the camera on a flat surface because the shutter speed is slower than normal.  The flash will fire in this situation if needed.  The landscape setting is used for distant objects and the flash will not fire unless you turn it on.  I use the landscape setting for most of my outdoor shots.  Finally, there is a close-up setting for objects that are 2.8 to 28 inches from the lens and the flash will fire if needed.

  Not indicated on the camera specifications is the video mode.  The camera is capable of taking short video clips with sound.  The quality is actually pretty good.  The internal 16mb memory contained within the camera will store a video of up to 1 minute and 10 seconds.  Additional time may be saved if a multi-media storage card is purchased.

  The camera shoots at tight and wide angles (a 3X optical zoom)that helps the user select different picture sizes.  The camera also has a 10X digital zoom.  The digital zoom feature is not actual photographic zoom.  This means that the lens does not bring the item closer to the user, but uses software to zoom in on a certain photo.  If you have ever zoomed in on a picture on the internet, you know that the closer the zoom, the more pixilated the picture.  Using the digital zoom all the way to the 10X feature will cause a pixilated picture for subjects closer than 50 feet.  It is a good feature, but I wish that I had an actual photographic zoom feature.

  The battery life is not very long, as stated in most of the other reviews, but this can be controlled by the user.  Using the LCD viewfinder will burn up the battery life very quickly.  To prevent the battery from discharging too quickly, turn this feature off and use the optical viewfinder.  You will NOT be able to use the digital zoom this way.  The battery life is also shortened greatly when used in cold temperatures (below 41 degrees F).  

  Additional features that camera has include date stamping, self timer, picture quality settings (for when you just want a picture to email that won't take up too much memory on the computer), orientation sensor (so that pictures with the camera held sideways will show up vertically and not on its side), artificial shutter sound (so that you know that the picture was taken), and a quick view that allows you to see the picture that you just shot so that you may delete it right away (and save storage space) if you don't like how it came out.  This will also help you to decide if you want to take another shot.  The camera can also be hooked up to your television to view pictures by more people and can be set to a slide-show setting.  

  Another point, the specs listed on this website list the camera as a 3.3 megapixel.  The camera is 3.1 megapixels.

  The included software package allows for some picture editing.  The editing feature is very limited and to do some real alterations, you will need to acquire some different software.  The editing does have a nice red-eye remover though.  

  You will also be able to email pictures straight from this program or have them sent to a picture production service (kodak, walmart, walgreens, etc.) to have regular photos printed.  You can also print your pictures from this software package.

  Another not of interest, I dropped this camera from about 15 feet up in a tree (don't ask) without damage.  It landed on soil and not concrete, but I was still quite happy that it still worked.

  The pictures come out great and I love the ease of use.  I am very happy with this camera and DO recommend it.
