            First off, I have to say that this is &quot;technically&quot; my husband's truck...but, I still get to drive it occasionally...and do I love it!  :-)

The Pathfinder makes for a smooth, comfortable, and downright pleasurable ride.  The seats are very comfortable, even for long trips, and the interior is durable (doesn't rattle when hitting bumps etc).   The V6 engine has a good &quot;get-up and go&quot; attitude, and the sleek design is visually pleasing to look at.

We are expecting our first baby soon, and I have already decided that this will be my car of choice very soon.  It has tons of room for the stroller (and all of baby's other things), as well as for my growing belly that soon won't fit in my other car!  :-)  I have to say, I am really looking forward to driving it.  It handles like a car, and I adore sitting up high!

In summary, the Nissan Pathfinder is a wonderful vehicle for your family.  We have had this car for 2 years, (1998) and have had no problems thus far.  It is fairly economical on fuel and is a sheer pleasure to drive...and to ride in.
