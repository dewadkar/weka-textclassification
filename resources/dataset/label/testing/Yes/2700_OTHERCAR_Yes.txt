            Based on dated reviews I was impressed by Agfa's  color rendition of earlier cameras. Especially regarding skin tones. The nickle hydride battery system is unbeatable. Results may vary but I usually get 100-117 exposures on a set of these rechargeable batteries. HYDRIDE batteries outperform nickle cadmium  10 to one. I would never buy a nicad operated camera if a comparable unit was available with hydride batteries. I added 4 sets of batteries and two 8 meg media cards to my set up. The lowest resolution allows me to go on safari with 20 megs of media to capture 275 images.  In an emergency you can use regular AA batteries. The view pane and lens section rotate independently. Great feature for long arm shots over a crowd.
Downloading to your computer is a snap. The video feature would allows you to view your pictures at greater size if you are away from a computer as you might be on vacation. 
deleting bad shots is simple and can extend your capacity while in the field.
Photo prints, even from low resolution are quite acceptable. there are several free services on the web where you can store your digital images and arrange to have photo prints made. This combined with the quality and ease of operation make this an excellent value for any one who wants to share their interests on the internet, be it a new baby, the team in action or envy generators for the guy on vacation.
This unit came with instructions in 12 different languages. 
The only drawback is viewing the screen in bright light.<br><br>
