            The 2000 Pontiac Grand Am GT1 is the most equipped value for your dollar today. This is my second GT and the nicest that I have owned. The controls are logically arranged and easy to understand. The seats are very comfortable and multi-adjustable. All power equipment works smooth and effortlessly. The standard 3.4L Ram Air equipped V-6 provides plenty of power, even at low RPM's. I have only two complaints about this vehicle. The first is the hideous rear spoiler on the trunk. It looks like something right out of &quot;Batman&quot;. It is either &quot;love it&quot; or &quot;hate it&quot;. The second is the rather rough ride that comes with the GT suspension. You will feel every bump and pothole. Pontiac really hit it right with this car. I recommend this car very highly. It is good to see a car so well equipped, and so affordable, that even a kid in college can afford.<br><br>
