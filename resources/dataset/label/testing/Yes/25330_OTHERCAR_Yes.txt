            I recently had an opportunity to drive a 1999 Mercury Mystique GS, rental package, and found the car to be worthy of note in several areas.  The Mystique, like it's sister car the Ford Contour, is based on the European Mondeo platform (which is also responsible for the new Mercury Cougar).  Based on that knowledge, I expected the car to exhibit good handling characteristics.  However, I was expecting a little more in the Mercury trim.

The interior of the car leaves much to be desired.  Cheap feeling plastics dominate the dash, including a nameplate placed just to the right of the gauge cluster.  A poor attempt at faux woodgrain surrounds the stereo and climate controls and the lower dash.  Seats are finished in inexpensive looking velour and cloth.  Exterior trim is a little better -- even in base trim, door handles and body moldings are color-keyed, and the car is equipped with an attractive chromed grille.  

Interior comfort and ergonomics are acceptable, but far from refined.  Front seats in the GS model have limited 4-way manual adjustment, and lower back support is lacking.  Head restraints, while incorporated into the seats, are sufficiently high to protect taller passengers.  A mini-armrest, just large enough to support an elbow, is placed enigmatically where only a taller driver will be able to use it.  Most controls are placed reasonably well, and are rather intuitive, however it is a bit of a reach from the steering wheel to the rather short turn signal and windshield wiper levers.  The rear defroster is poorly placed on the left of the dash, far away from other climate controls.  The brake-shifter interlock, which prevents the transmission from being moved into a driving range unless the brake is depressed, is very noisy.  One-touch down operation of the driver's window is difficult to use without practice, as anything more than the slightest touch accesses normal operation.  Interior storage is adequate, with decent room in the center console and pockets on the back of both front seats.  

The Mystique does offer a decent array of safety features.  All five passengers benefit from three-point safety belts, and the driver and front passenger are protected by front-impact airbags.  Side-impact protection airbags are not offered on the Mystique.  I strongly recommend selecting a model with anti-lock brakes, as the car I drove would not have performed nearly as well without them.   

Ford has a lot to learn from other makers of four cylinder engines in designing an engine that offers sufficient low end torque to propel a smaller car to speed.  The DOHC 2.0L Four is very weak below 3500 RPM's, and very noisy above.  I suspect the automatic transmission is responsible for some of the sluggishness of this engine, still, overall performance is inexcusable, especially in a car which exhibits the ability to control additional power.  I would recommend selecting a car with the 2.5L Duratec V6 if one requires an automatic transmission.  

The car's best point, however, is it's handling.  The Mystique is very capable in both high-speed and low-speed maneuvers, leaning gently into even the most daunting of corners.  Steering feel is very heavy, and very accurate.  The slightest turn of the wheel will serve to execute even a high-speed lane change, and feedback through the wheel is very easy to read.  Ford has done and excellent job of designing a constant, confidence inspiring steering system, as the handling of the Mystique reminded me more of that found in older Volkswagens (1990-92 Jettas, for example), than of any previous Ford vehicle I had driven.  Unfortunately, the Mystique does not have the power to follow through a turn.  The car does exhibit some understeer, but it is not particularly pronounced, even at higher speeds.  The engine was too weak to produce torque steer, although this might be a concern with the V6.  Braking is good, however, the car's nose dives substantially in harder braking.  Rear disc brakes would be a good improvement.

Overall, the Mystique is an excellent vehicle for those looking for an inexpensive car with European handing characteristics.  It is a far cry from a BMW, but at around half the price of a nicely equipped 3-series, one wouldn't expect it to compare.  It would serve nicely as a family car for a smaller family, and still offer Mom and Dad a little fun behind the wheel, as well.
