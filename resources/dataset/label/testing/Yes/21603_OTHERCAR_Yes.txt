            I purchased a 1997 Dodge van a few months ago and love it!  This was actually a replacement van for the 1986 that I had for 10 years.  The old van was a good one, I hauled heavy loads, traveled across the country, and even camped in it, but like all good things, it just wore out.  It was rarely in the shop though throughout it's life.  This 1997 van is an even mightier version of it's older sibling.  It has excellent power (of course this has a V8 as opposed to an in line 6 the old one had).  Even though it has a larger engine and does use a bit of gas, the fuel economy is about the same as the smaller engine.  As vans go, I would buy a Dodge!<br><br>
