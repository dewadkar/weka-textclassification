            I bought my Honda because i told myself if Honda came out with a truck that was usable for all seasons i would buy it. We had a Honda motorcycle and we have a Honda Prelude and they are good vehicles.

I wish they had built a rack for them as that is what most buyers like when they are out doors skiing,snowboarding,camping and other outdoor activities.I have to put heaver oil in it every 3 months but thats good maintainence on the owner part.

I just love my Honda as it gives me the ability to be comfortable but safe. I enjoy the cd player,or tape deck and that i can listen to music of any kind while in my vehicle when i go on a trip. 

I drive my Honda to work every day and love the comfort it gives me. It is very safe as i have been in an accident with it (someone ran a stop sign) and it hardly damaged the truck but the other persons car was not good. I hardly felt the impact as it is will contructed. I would not give my honda up for another unless it is to get a newer model.

If you are a very active out door person and want a vehicle to preform well in the rain and snow and be able to haul items in the back this is great. If you are not a truck person or afraid of to much Vehicle then this is not for you. I enjoy my Honda very much!!!.
