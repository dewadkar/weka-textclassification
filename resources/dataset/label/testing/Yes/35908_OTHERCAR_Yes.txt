            I bought this camera because of its low price. This is a fully automatic point and shoot camera with no manual controls except for white balance and certain flash settings. Having had many pro grade film cameras, this is my first digital just to get a feel. The camera came with a pouch which is nice and of course you will have to invest in a NiMh charger and batteries for reasonable battery life and economy. On the top of the camera is an LCD display(rare even in higher priced digital camera) which shows shots remaining, resolution and flash settings. Pictures are of good quality and sharp even when I print if off a color laser on 8 x 11 letter size considering it is only a 2 megapixel. Outdoor shots were very good, colors generally accurate. However lacking an autofocus illuminator, the camera does not focus well indoors especially if not too brightly lit. The only manual control is white balance which you set to auto or some fixed settings. On one occasion I was not able to prevent a bluish cast when the picture was taken in a shade even though I tried all the different white balance settings. It takes SD memory cards and a 64M yield a maximun of 88 maximum resolution shots. It has a silent movie mode although it is low resolution and grainy. Overall, for the price, I think it is a very good camera. The camera looks identical to the more expensive Minox DC 2133 possibly rebadged for Minox by Konica.
