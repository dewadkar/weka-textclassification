            The name caprice classic says it all, CLASSIC!! This car is the best car that I have ever had, I just had it repainted a two tone brown and with the camaro rims is a definite eye catcher. The year is 83' the old body style looks great and is for sure in imnaculate condition. 

The other thing is that the engine is a 350 diesel and thus gets great gas mileage and is pretty much mechanical free. The car rides great, I have owned the car for 9 months and in that time have put over 22,000 miles on it and have traveled all over with it. 

The car it self has 224,000 miles but because of it's (tlc) it's whole life it runs like it's brand new! The only complaint that I can scrape together is that I wish it would take off a little quicker but when it is moving passes and climbs hills great. 

This car is a great buy if one can find a caprice with a diesel, because it has massive trunk space and room inside the car, and gets great gas mileage a great pick for a long trip, or if you just want to tool around in a big great looking car. 

I can't believe they stop production on such a great made and great looking car. To sum it up a excellent buy, an excellent car!!<br><br>
