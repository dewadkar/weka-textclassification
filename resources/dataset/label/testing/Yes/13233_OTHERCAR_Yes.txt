            Plymouth Grand Voyager I have been driving for over 15 years now. I got my first Plymouth Grand Voyager one year after it first came out in 1985. I got my second just 1 year ago. I traded my old one in for a new one. I now have the 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager LE with tri-zone a/c. There is two a/c's one in the front and one in the back. The front one is dual zoned. The driver can have it one temperature and the passenger seat may have it another temperature. The back a/c is controlled either from the front or the controlls in the back. This Plymouth Grand Voyager has made it through multiply 1000 mile trips and still comes out looking and feeling and driving like new. The space in the Plymouth Grand Voyager revails that of the Chevy Suberban! There is enough space in this mini-van for 6 adults and 1 child sitting comfortly! There is enough cargo space with all of the seats out except the driver and passenger seat to hold sheets of plywood and more! The only bad thing about these kinds on vechicals is that they at the max going downhill without the a/c running you can get 25 miles/gallon. And who drives all the time like that? like no one! I usually get around 16-17 miles/gallon and I usually drive suburban driving.
Conclution- Plymouth Grand Voyager is a good buy!
