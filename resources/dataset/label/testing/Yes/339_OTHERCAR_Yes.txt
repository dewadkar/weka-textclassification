            My husband and I test drove the 2000 Nissan Xterra Manual 4WD SE.  It was great.  There was very little noise in the cabin.  The engine was quiet and we didn't experience the road noice we had when we owned a Honda Passport.  Also when we made turns (left or right) or U-turns, we didn't experience the heavy roll we'd experienced with our Honda Passport.  It handled very well and we could even live with the price, about $25,000 with the extras my husband wanted added.

What we could not handle was the dealer.  We live in the Suburbs around D.C. and we intended to use our Ford Aerostar as a trade in.  The dealers here wanted us to not only trade in our vehicle, but to give them $5000 as a down payment as well.  

We felt this was unreasonable.  If a person looking to buy this vehicle can find a reasonable dealer, than by all means, buy it.  It's a wonderful SUV, the best we ever test drove.  But be sure to do your research first.  Make sure you are getting the best possible deal.  And do not leap at the dealers' first offer.  Remember their first goal is to make money.
