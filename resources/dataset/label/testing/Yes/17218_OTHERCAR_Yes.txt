            The 1991 Mercury Capri was the first car I ever owned.  It proved incredibly reliable and so much fun.  Many memories were made with this car.  It got me where I needed to go and farther!  I went everywhere in my little Mercury.  I owned this car from June 1991 through May 1997 and in that time, put in over 100,000 miles on it.  I burned out one engine, bought a rebuilt one and the car was never the same again.  I no longer own this car but I have some fond memories as well as a few attributes I didn�t care for.

COST
I bought this car brand new, putting $4,000.00 down.  After tax and license fees I paid $15,000.00.  My payments were $207.05 for 60 months.  

CONVERTIBLE TOP
Unfortunately, because the car had a vinyl top, this was an open invitation for vandalism and theft.  My convertible top was broken into twice.  The top was recalled once, which came at an appropriate time because the plastic window in the back turned yellow, than orange with time in the southern California sun.  After I received a new top, I bought special conditioner for the window to prevent weathering and keep it in good condition.  Naturally, I needed to see out of it when I drove, but I also wanted it to look nice.  It lasted slightly longer than the first top, but eventually the yellow haze began to creep up the window from the bottom and worked its way up to the top.  Soon I could no longer see out the back window at all.  Poor vision is an understatement!  

Right before I sold my Mercury, I had trouble getting the top down.  It wouldn�t go down into the compartment.  I had to keep the top up until I sold it.

On a positive note, when you have a convertible, you have an invitation for fun.  Nothing better than driving with the top down, the wind in your hair, other cars pacing you so they can "yell" at you across a speeding highway!  Fun stuff!

BODY
The size was perfect for fitting in tight spaces while driving and parking.  This car could go anywhere�well, almost!  No 4x-ing of course!  It was definitely a car that drew the attention of others and I met many interesting people on my Friday and Saturday nights out.  This car is cute, sporty and compact.  

On the other hand, there are those out there who don�t allow people to have anything nice.  This car gained its share of dings and dents.  No problem, they just gave the car more character!  Funny story:  someone actually tore off one of my windshield wipers in Hollywood, CA!  I was left with one wiper -- had a good laugh over that one!  

ENGINE SPEED
For a 4-cylinder with an automatic transmission, this car was quick.  I loved how easily I could whip around other cars and brake fast when I needed to.

However, this car had a hard time making it up hills and after about 50,000 miles did not have take off speed.  It would creep slowly, going about 0 to 60 in 2 minutes!

INTERIOR
Cleaning this car was not a fun chore.  The wheel wells had many small nooks and crannies.  So did the console between the seats.  It was a magnet for dirt and many a q-tip was used for gaining access to small, inaccessible parts all throughout the inside of the car.  Most notably hard to clean was the cup holder and the area under the manual break.  Many small slats were lined up, (looked like a coin holder), and they would trap dirt.  It was almost impossible to get clean.  Because of this hassle, my car rarely got a good cleaning treatment after a while.  I would take it to the car wash out of laziness.   Procrastinating a good cleaning job became habit.

There is a back seat but it is minimal.   It fits approximately two people not too comfortably.  However, I did cram seven people in this car at one point.  (Don�t try this one at home�not too intelligent!)

MAINTENANCE
Parts for this vehicle were expensive � they came from Japan, or so I was told.  Because everything was electrical, fixing broken windows and locks cost plenty.  The windows failed to work more than once.   At one point, the motor failed and the window was stuck right in the middle of trying to roll it up.  It was left partially down until I could get the money to get it fixed.  (Not pleasant in a good rain!)

CONCLUSION
This car is perfect for young girls.  This is a "chick car" to the fullest.  Obviously, this is not a family car, although I did use it for a short time after the birth of my first child.  I would not recommend this car to someone looking for ease of care or affordable maintenance.  This car is perfect as a first car and for someone who doesn�t mind attention.  Anyone looking for a unique, fun and cute design will find it with the Mercury Capri.

Because this was the first car I ever owned, I was young and na�ve when I bought it.  I am ashamed to say I didn�t take very good care of this vehicle.  If I would have been more responsible, and listened to those around me more, I probably would still have this car to this day.  I do miss it.  I miss the feeling of freedom and fun times it provided me.  Although, I do have a nice big Chevy now, but that�s another epinion!
