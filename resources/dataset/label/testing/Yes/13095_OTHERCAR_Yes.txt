            Ever hear the phrase &quot;refrigerator car&quot;? That's what they
call the Honda Accord. I read it in an online review someplace while I was researching cars to buy...
I read up about coupes in the 20-25K price range for three months 
before going in for this one... I loved the Prelude, it wasn't too expensive (the base model) and excellent performance..it's just too small. I wish I could have afforded one when I was a teenager :(
The only other decent comparable cars were the Acura CL and the Camry
Solara. It's not that I don't like Acuras, but for the price range
(definitely more expensive than Accords), I think they could
be a little more tasteful with the interior (and the exterior).
The Solara...well I think it's just a plagiarized version of the Accord and the only advantage is that it is available with a stick shift
if you opt for a V6, which I wasn't gonna buy anyway.
My priorities were clear, I wanted a car that I could drive for a
year, pass on to my girlfriend and buy a Prelude :)
So I went in for a 4 cylinder automatic transmission...coz it was
a cool looking car and no one really wanted a 4 cylinder Accord Coupe,
they all wanted a V6 :)
And since I walked into a dealership on the last weekend of the year
(it really works...) they were in a hurry to get rid of the 4 cylinder
one (they just had one in stock) and I managed to walk out of the
dealership in just 2 hours with a '99 Honda Accord coupe for under 
$20K.
Oh, one more thing...the EX is a fantastic deal, it comes with everything, there are no options other than a spoiler and a sport package...even a security system and a keyless entry are included.
One more cool thing is that the car keys have a chip inside, so the car cannot start without these keys (bimmer style). But lose them and you'll have to spend about $130 or so for a replacement.
Anyway, it's 13 months since I first drove the car and I still love it.
So much that I convinced my girlfriend to keep her old car and let me
drive this one. I still can't believe I'm driving an automatic and
liking it, but it drives well, the driver and passenger drive 
comfortably (the space in the back is not bad at all for a coupe, but 
access is restricted), and it's low maintenance. So far, I've had just
several oil changes and a 15K mile tuneup. 
Another advantage over other cars: everything about this car is decently priced...the mats, the tune-ups...everything...sure, it's more expensive than a Ford Escort or a Toyota Corolla, but it's worth the money. You save a lot in the long run.
All the people I know spend about $300 on tune-ups (Japanese cars). 
I just had one a few months back and I spent about $110...talk about low
maintenance!
The ride is a little noisy compared to a Solara, but definitely quieter than an Acura Integra or CL.
Cons:
The ergonomics are unbeatable, except for the seats, which are kind of 
uncomfortable compared to other cars. But that's a matter of the driver's
size and comfort level, I guess.
The rearview mirror is too narrow and the real windshield is kinda high (making it harder for smaller drivers to back the car out)
Overall, this car is very reliable, has very low maintenance needs, and is very good lookin' (I love the streak that runs along the side of 
the car)
The Accord coupe used to be a rare sight about a year back, but now
too many people have it. So don't buy this car unless you really have to, else you're gonna drive my car out of its exclusivity status (or whatever's left of it :)
