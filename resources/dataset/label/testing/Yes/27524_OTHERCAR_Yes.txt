            Hi everyone. I am writing to you to tell you about my experience with the Jeep Grand Cherokee. I have had this 1996 model for two years now and I love it! This was my first luxury purchase and let me tell you, it is one smooth vehicle! The limited (which I have) has every option you could want. Power mirrors, brakes, locks, seats, and luxury surround. The stereo is an infinity gold system which will shake you out the door! CD and cassette with controls mounted on the steering wheel makes for easy control while driving. The on board console center tells you when your next tune up and oil change is due. The overhead center tells you temperature, direction you are going, ETA, gas milage you are getting and an electronic odometer. All driver controls seem to be at your fingertips and easily accssesible. The center console is very generous in inside room for storage and it also has a pull out cup holder for two backseat passengers. The rear seats fold down and you(and another passenger) can fit in the jeep with a full 4x8 sheet of plywood in the rear with the tailgate closed. Factory tinting on the windows ensures cool summer days. 

I live in WV and I have had this Jeep in places you would not believe! I have been in sludge ponds in the coal mines, back in the woods off road, and all over in the snow. I have never been stuck yet! 

*****I would like to mention one more thing if I may that kind of relates to safety. Last JJanuary, my wife was traveling at 60 miles anhour with cruise control set. A coal truck came around the corner and tapped my wife's front bumper on this Jeep. It spun her around, into the truck, threw the Jeep into the gaurd rail and ripped both bumpers off, caved in both passenger side doors and ripped the back tailgate in half while blowing out two tires and crushing two aluminum mags. My 8 year old daughter and my mother in law were also in the vehicle and thank GOD!, no one was hurt. When we saw the damage it broke our heart because we knew our Jeep was totaled. After taking it to the body shop, we were suprised to learn that the frame was totally unharmed and it all could be fixed. After twenty two days and 6,254.00 of insurance money, the Jeep looked brand new! We have been driving now six months and never have had a problem with alignment, brakes or anything else.

 I do feel comfortable knowing my family is in a safe vehicle but still with so much luxury and style! My advice....Grab one if you can, you will love it!!!<br><br>
