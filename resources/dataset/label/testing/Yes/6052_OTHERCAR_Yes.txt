            For those of you looking for a bargain, this is the camera to go with.  I received mine from a friend and I have enjoyed it immensely since!  It comes with all the cables you'll need to hook it up to the t.v. and computer.  The images appear almost instantly on the t.v. and if you use the USB cable that is included it is really fast to download on your computer to save or print.  The clarity is amazingly nice, although, you have to have just the right lighting and distance from the camera.  It isn't a camera you would want to use for scenery, more for people.  It has an automatic flash and I love that it has a timer so everyone can be in the picture.  It is nice and small and is easy to carry around.  I have never had a digital camera and although this isn't probably the BEST camera out there, it is a good camera, for an affordable price, with all the features you would need to set up a power point presentation, or just print pictures for your friends.  It's a great first camera to learn how to use a digital camera and I was very impressed with the quality of the pictures.  It also uses two double A batteries.
