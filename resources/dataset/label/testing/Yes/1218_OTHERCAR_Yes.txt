               During my senior year of high school a good friend of mine, Greg, had scrimped enough money together to buy his realistic dream car, a Toyota MR2.  After a lot of begging and pleading Greg finally let me drive his wonderful machine.  It was a beautiful spring day so the T-tops were off and the car looked fabulous.  I got into the drivers seat and all the controls were exactly where i expected them to be.  The ergonomics of the MR2 are quite good.  I started the car and the engine made the normal Toyota sound that i am so very used to, however the MR2's engine has a lower more powerful sound than the Corolla's. (I drive an '86 Corolla, if you couldn't already tell from the screen name.)
    
I pulled the car out of the parking lot and out into the street, with a slight push on the gas pedal we were gone.  Even though Greg's MR2 is not turbocharged, it still has quite a bit of power and torque.  The shifter throws are a little long, but i could get used to that.  The handling is very good.  The weight of the car feels well distributed.  There was very little body roll even at high speeds.  I love this car.

    The only real annoyance is the fact that there is no trunk or back seat.  It is strictly a two-seater, and you can't take the car to the grocery store and buy a weeks worth of groceries for a family of four.  The MR2 is definitely a toy car, something to scoot around town in.  If you want to carry passengers buy a four door, but if you want to have a great time behind the wheel, buy an MR2.
