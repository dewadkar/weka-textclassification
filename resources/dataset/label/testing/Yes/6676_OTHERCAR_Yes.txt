            My wife and I decided to buy this van when Nicole became a traveling nurse.  She has allot of baggage that she takes with her.  She first bought a 1996 dodge van in Minneapolis 2 months ago.  It was a conversion van.  She really loved the way it handled while driving it home.  When she arrived home we have a Dodge dealership 2 blocks away.  She then noticed this new 1999 Dodge Ram conversion van sitting on there lot. 
To make a long store short we traded the 1996 in on the new 1999 Dodge Ram van.  The day we took it home I noticed stop welds showing through the out side of the body where the floor meets the outside shell.  I took it back to the dealership and showed them the spots welds.  They got with there dealer rep and the rep stated that this is a vehicle
characteristic and will not be repaired under warranty.  I have done a little searching and found that in 1998 when Dodge was letting the conversion companies convert their vans that the rubber door guard that went around the van was left off due to the looks of the conversion kits.  This left the spot welds exposed.  When you but a 36,000 dollar van you really do not want to see spot welds showing through.  Chrysler so far is doing nothing about this.  I have one Ave. left and that is going through Arbitration.  We will see what happens then.  I really think this is a poor Ave. to take on Chryslers part.  It is OK to have
the door guard on the work van but when you get a conversion package added to really make it look pretty, you leave the door guard off and let the spot welds show through.

I would recommend this van to anyone.  It drives and rides great.  But I would have to point out the spot welds<br><br>
