            Prior to buying this 1999 4.0 liter V6 Super Cab 4 WD I had a 1997 Ranger with standard cab.  I am glad that I have the 1999.  It has more room, seats are well positioned, very comfortable on long drives (500 miles in a day).  Mileage around town is 17 mpg and trips 20+ mpg.  It handles well on the highway and OK off road (Can't compare to my 1985 4Runner).  We own a 22' Four Winns bow rider and pull it from dry storage to ramp (8 miles).  Have pulled the boat 200 miles from 7000 ft to 800 ft altitude and back.  It will do it, but I don't think it likes it.  

The truck now has 23000 miles and still feels solid.  It has the Wilderness AT 16 inch tires (makes me nervous).  The 4wd seems to function well with the limited slip differential.  Lately the brakes have felt less than solid.  Leaving a parking lot the pedal barely moved and vehicle would not stop immediately.  I have not had time to take this issue to the dealer.

Over all this is a great vehicle for the price and I would recommend it to anyone needing a small pickup for recreation and light business.   <br><br>
