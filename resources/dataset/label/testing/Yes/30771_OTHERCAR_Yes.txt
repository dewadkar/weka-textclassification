            If you�re looking for a high quality, fairly inexpensive digital camera check out the Olympus D-340R.  I love it.  It takes great quality shots indoors and outdoors.  This camera is listed among the 100 most popular digital cameras on cnet.  You can snap several shots at half-second intervals.  It takes 4-AA alkaline, nickel metal hydride, lithium or NiCd batteries, you don�t have to purchase those expensive camera batteries.  This cameras has lots of features.  The pictures are easy to download and can also be viewed on your TV with the video output connector.  I compared several different digital cameras and this was one of the best for the price.<br><br>
