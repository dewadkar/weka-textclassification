            I loved this camera from the moment I got it. It is compact and handy, gives excellent image and has tons of options for all kind of situations.

I took pictures and printed (8 X 10) them on a HP printer and you cannot tell if they have been developed at a photo shop from a 35 mm or printed at home. This camera has a cool option to save each picture in small mode to share online and emailing and stuff. The amount of detail this camera captures is amazing. Even the pictures in Auto mode come out very nice and sharp. It can be a point and shoot or for advanced users it has tons of settings.

Since this camera uses a Compact Flash which is a very generic storage option, windows XP based machines instantly recognize and download stuff from camera even without installing Nikon provided software - which is nice to install anyways so you can play with pictures with nice editing software that comes with it.

One of the features I love is, you have an option to charge batteries in camera or with the charger that comes with camera. This gives you flexibility. Lot of cameras do not come with external chargers (you have to buy them as accessory) and if you use camera to charge battery you cannot use the camera but not so with Coolpix 4300. It comes standard with an external battery charger as well as you can use camera to charge battery and use camera too (Although you have to buy the A/C cable separately)

One of the things I would recommend is to buy a bigger compact flash card because the one that comes with camera is too small to hold too many pictures especially in Fine quality.

Another little annoyance is camera does not come with a neck strap, but I worked around that by carrying camera in case that has a neck strap, not as convenient but thats the best I could think of.

Some people complain about no audio in video mode but if you want to shoot video go get a video camera, the primary function of this device is to take stills.

Other thing is you cannot attach an external flash but for home users you do not really need that, anyway if you need a camera with this option you will end up shelling out couple of 100 bucks more than this.

I bought this camera online from buydig for $394 (base price for camera was $349) including a bigger card, lens cleaning kit and a carrying case.
