            I bought this camera about eight months ago to replace an Olympus D-340 camera that I loved except for one major problem...ZOOM LENS!  This camera has an exceptional optical zoom lens.  That coupled with 1.3 mega pixel resolution (which by the way is more than adequate for most users), makes for a great combination.

First, the camera...LOVE IT!  It's less expensive than the 2.1 mega pixel models but still delivers great photos in HQ mode.  It looks, feels, and acts like a standard point and shoot camera.  Controls are in convenient ergonomic locations.

Photos come out great at all focal lengths and lighting conditions.  There are several flash modes on this camera.  Learn them, their proper application, and put them to use!!!  You will get much better results than if you just turn the flash on and off depending on how light or dark it is.

POWER...This camera eats batteries like no other (especially when using the display!)  Throw-away batteries for this baby are a no-no.  Believe it or not, I've gotten great results from Raovac Renewal Rechargeable Alkaline batteries.  Eight batteries with a charger are about $12.00 and additional packs of four are about $6.00.  Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are about $25.00 for four NOT INCLUDING THE CHARGER.  You do the math.  I have one set (four) in the camera and carry another two sets in the camera case.  The key to keeping the Rayovacs up-to-snuff is charging.  After using the camera, charge the batteries whether they're fully discharged or not.  I know what you are thinking...eight spare batteries is a lot to carry around!  Remember, you're only carrying the camera, some extra batteries, and spare memory cards...THAT'S ALL!  NO BULKY FILM!

MEMORY...When I bought the camera it came with an 8mb card.  If you are going to be shooting on HQ mode (and I know you are), you MUST have more memory.  Check the web...cards from Simple Technology work great and were the least expensive.  Have at least another two 8mb cards available for swapping.  And, don't underestimate the value of deleting the photos that don't come out right.  A quick check on the display, and some deletions will maximize those cards greatly.

Transferring images from the camera to your PC or MAC is a breeze with the included serial cable cable.  Mac users have an Apple-talk adapter.  Software for both PC and Mac are easy and straight forward (MAC users...follow the instructions carefully and make sure you install the plug-in into the proper folder or else your photo software won't recognize that it's there.)

The only thing that's a little messy is the menu system on the camera itself.  Once you're using it regularly it's a snap.  But if it's been a while since you picked up the camera, you'll have to take a short refresher course.  Therefore, keep the instruction book handy!

Another thing...you're not using film!  Press the shutter and don't worry about it.  Delete the photos you don't want right away to maximize memory.  There is no wasting film with digital.  You can get some great shots this way!

Now, lets talk about optical vs. digital zooming.  Optical is by far better.  Optical zooming uses the camera's lens to zoom in or out on a subject whereas digital zooming uses a computer program to increase the size of the composition.  This camera has both a 3x optical zoom, and a 2x digital zoom.  The digital zoom it is only available in standard resolution (640x480), not HQ mode.  When considering cameras other than this one make sure that the zoom is NOT just digital!

What resolution should you shoot at?  Higher gets you better, larger photos but uses more memory.  And standard mode will give you generally adequate photos at 640x480 resolution.  Personally, I never use standard mode.  Why?  The quality of HQ mode is better for printing and if I want to use a photo for the web, I use photo editing software to cut the file size.  Fact of the matter is I never know when I'm taking a photo whether I want to print it or not.  So better to play it safe and have all my photos be better quality.

One last thing...when shopping, make sure you can see some results at the store.  Therefore go to a camera store, not CompUSA or Staples, etc.  CompUSA's &amp; Staples cameras are bolted to the display, and rarely have power connected to them.  A good camera store will power the camera up for you so you can squeeze off a few shots.  Make comparisons about everything.  When you're ready to buy CHECK THE WEB for the best deal, then buy where ever you get the best price.  $500 is a lot to spend for something that fits in the palm of your hand...you better be sure it's right for you.

UPDATE 5/24/2000...Out of curiosity I checked some prices and the best I could find are:

D450-Z... Best Stop Digital (www.beststopdigital.com)... $362.00
D460-Z... BUY.COM (www.buy.com)... $399.00<br><br>
