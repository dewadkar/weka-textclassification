              I recently decided to jump into the digital camera pool.  As I have a tight budget, I opted to go towards the lower end of the price spectrum. I found the Concord Eye-Q 1300 on Ebay for about 70 Dollars or so, and I bought it.  
  The camera takes a little getting used to, in terms of learning to carefully stabilize shots (you can attach a tripod if desired), learning optimal shot distance (about 2-6 feet), and learning the peculiarities of the camera, as with any camera.
  The camera performs best outside, in well lit areas. Indoors, the picture can be very grainy if flash is not used.  With flash, an indor shot which is done right (again, this comes with practice) can be pretty good (keep in mind flash does use alot of battery). Outdoors shots done right can be surprisingly good.
  The camera-computer interface via the USB cable is very smooth and fast.  Pictures are conveniently downloaded in JPG format.  
  The camera has several picture quality levels, as well as options such as 2x zoom, timer, flash, and also takes short videos (a few seconds long).  The quality that I have experienced with the video and zoom are not great, but when used as a webcam the image is low-res but acceptable. Note that at least on my computer, the included webcam software seems to have some bugs in it, and it seems to crash on my machine, but at least for me I dont care since I dont do web-camming.
  The camera itself has a small, volatile (i.e. lost if batteries are removed) memory, but you can add a data card and not only increase memory but not worry about losing the pictures with the batteries.  Also, the camera does use conventionalor rechargable AA batteries, no special hard-to-find ones (keep in mind that to conserve battery you must shut off camera when not in use, even between pics if you are just stanging around; like many cameras, this one can be battery hungry, but this is not such a big issue if you use rechargables).
  Overall, I am quite satisfied with the camera, image quality for my purposes (moslty outdoors), ease of use, and more.  It is a good value for the price, and even though technically is at the lower end of the digital camera spectrum, it is a decent starting camera, and adequate for casual use.  I have had no problems with it yet, and if you are not ready to spend a few hundred for a more advanced camera, I would reccomend starting with this one.

P.S. If you do buy this cam and need any advice on usage tips, email me at sscheinfe@aol.com
