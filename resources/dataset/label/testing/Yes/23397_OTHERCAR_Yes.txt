            I love these cars they are very fast if you need to pass quick it has no problems at all. They have been one of the safest cars in the world for a very long time. They have a very smooth ride even at high speeds (i should know) SAAB has been making cars since 1946. They have consintrated on safety, reliabilty, price, economics, and performance for a long time they are the people you can thank for great Turbos, self repairing bumpers, heated seats, headlamp wipers, side impact beams, SAHR (Saab active head restraint system), and many other things todays car manufacturers have now. SAABs are great cars they have there own look to them and i promise you that if you drive one you will either love it or hate it but if you drive it chances are you will love it. They are very solid cars. I was in an accident in mine on the freeway going about 75 a pick up cut me off do to great braking i stopped in time but when i did a suberban rear ended me then another pick up rear ended him i was not wearing a seat belt and i walked away with out a scratch on me and i still have that same SAAB to this day but it is in better condition then it was at that time. SAABs handel very well and do not slide easy. They are the car for people who like to ski and/or snowboard they handle great in the snow and ice. They are made in sweden they should know about snow. Due to the massive trunk space you can haul just about anything you can fit in there which is alot. They can tow things too i have seen SAABs towing small boats before. They are the most versitile car i have seen. If you have kids you can feel safe in a SAAB knowing that if something does happen you and your kids will be safe the car will die before you do. Do yourself a favore and at least try a SAAB i bet you will love it.
