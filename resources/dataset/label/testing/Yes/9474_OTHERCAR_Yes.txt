            for those diehard trucking enthusiasts, the 2000 dodge ram 1500 is the ultimate machine with an extensive bank of capabilities.  ground clearance: i'd take this monster off-road any day without fearing the worst.  made for rugged terrain, this truck handles very well off road as well as it does on concrete.  if you wanted to take your house with you when you moved, this truck would do the job.  with a powerful engine and towing ability, sometimes you wonder if there's just too much power in this little truck.  

although dodge builds the most powerful trucks (for hauling and towing), they put an extremely high price tag on their products.  for the dodge ram 1500 complete with options, you can purchase a chevrolet silverado (with all options, extended cab, and extra door options, more luxury) for about the same price and cheaper than the dodge.

also if you don't mind paying for gas all the time, the 15 miles per gallon gas mileage really doesn't matter.  

if you're looking for a great heavy-duty truck made for any terrain and any type of job, the dodge ram is a great truck.  it's for trucking fanatics who appreciate all the power and don't care much for gas mileage or luxury.  if you want luxury, more options on a lower price tag, and a family truck that you don't intend on taking off road very often, i recommend the chevy silverado.<br><br>
