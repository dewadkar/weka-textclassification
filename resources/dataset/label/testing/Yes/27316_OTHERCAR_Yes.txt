            Now this is a vehicle, for those of us who have kids, this vehicle blows the minivan out of the water. Its compact yet feels huge inside and has enough power to get you out of any situation.  Having a Dodge Ram extended Cab pickup, My wife was really interested in a new vehicle, so we went shopping around we tried em all, and this is our top choice.

This Vehicle feels very plush inside and the stereo system will blow you away, the 3rd seat is comfortable and easily removed for more storage.  I'm amazed at how well Dodge has put all the best from all the SUV's I've looked at into one  vehicle.  Do yourself a favor and if you thinking about a new vehicle take the time to take this for a long test drive, its comfortable, roomy, and rides like a high priced luxury car.<br><br>
