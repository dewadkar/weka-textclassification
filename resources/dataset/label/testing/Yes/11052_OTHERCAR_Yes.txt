            I bought it in February and now have over 12,000 miles since I use it for sales work in eastern Washington, Idaho and Montana.  I am VERY impressed.  In my work, I have driven other cars, trucks and vans; but this is the ONLY one I would buy again.  The driver's seat can be adjusted so I don't have a sore back at the end of the day... I can't say that about the others.  The power is there to pass on the 2-lane without drama or fear... and the engine just pulls eagerly.  I weighed this one day: with me and a half-tank of gas it hit 4010#, so it's no light-weight, and this is good going over Look Out Pass in the winter (which I did).  At the same time, it takes those mountain pass corners very securely, and sucks up pot-hole bumps amazingly well.  According to the user's manual, you can actually form a bed out of the reclining seats!  (I have not tried this, yet.)  THEY SAY that this is a "family" car.  I SAY that it is just fun AND practical.  The balance, power and stability are just amazing.  I can't tell you the number of people that I have "surprised" when I could pass and they couldn't... poor little Civic didn't have a chance  ;-)
