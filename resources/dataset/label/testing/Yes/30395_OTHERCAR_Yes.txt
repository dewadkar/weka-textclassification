            I don't know about you, but I am sick of looking out over the highway and seeing hundreds of cars that I can't tell apart without looking at the name on the side.  I welcome the originality of the Pontiac Aztek.  Of course, I realize that different does not always equal good, but in this case it does.  I have been driving the Aztek for about three monthes now and have no regrets about buying it so far.  

I get mixed reactions from people when I am out driving, but I always love to see them, good or bad.  I drove a Pontiac Grand Am for ten years before this and the Aztek handles in a very similar fashion despite being much larger.  I do wish it was higher off the ground, but it gets over small obstacles with no problems.  

I have taken it camping and enjoyed it very much.  I haven't yet bought the camping package.  Rather I bought a 15 dollar air mattress on my own and with the seats taken out two people slept comfortably in the rear with the rear hatch closed.  It happened to be very cold and we were able to just start the car and turn on the heat for a few minutes to warm up.  You know, really roughing it with heat, lights, and a cd player.  The radio controls in the rear are another excellent feature.  The worst feature, however, is the gas cap.  You will understand when you try to use it a few times.  A small inconvience, but no big deal.

People usually are skeptical about this car, but most people who have really taken a look at the inside of my car and ridden in it once are twice end up liking it.  This is not a car for the close minded.  You must give yourself a chance to get to know the Pontiac Aztek, but beware you might just fall in love. (X)<br><br>
