            D-490 Zoom
Well, I sold my last Olympus Digital camera on eBay and purchased a new one this and this camera is incredible!! 

While my old camera was great for a novice I quickly grew bored with it. I needed something better. The D-490 Zoom is a  2.11 megapixel and still easy to use. For the most part it is a point-and-shoot digital camera and has 3X optical zoom and 2X digital telephoto. This alone was the kicker for me. I take a lot of close-ups and they turn out great.  It has a movie option: 15 frames per second for up to 60 seconds. You can view the movie via camera, computer or TV. 
 
It is small and smart looking. I took this camera to the International Airshow and took some stunning pictures. I was surprised at how well the rapid shooting option really worked. The rapid shooting works 1.3 frames per second allowing you to get several succeeding pictures depending on your quality as to how many you can take. 

The LCD allows you to look over and edit the pictures you have taken. As with my last camera you must be good at the game twister � at times taking pictures outside you can find yourself with your leg in the air, one hand around your head and jumping up and down on one foot to see the LCD due to sunlight!!

The software that comes with the camera is alright, although I am partial to my own software. I don�t have a quick card to download pictures I use a cable, it takes about 10 minutes for 36 pictures. Just enough time to make a sandwich and chips!! The camera did come with long-life lithium batteries but I use a AC adapter. This camera gets a work out, almost nightly I take 36 to 72 pictures.

You can find one on sale for about $550.00 (worth every penny)

Some other features copied out of my book:
Five-mode flash system with red-eye reduction, force-fill flash, automatic low-light and back-light mode, flash-off and slow-sync.
4.5cm (1.8-inch) color LCD monitor with ability to display 4, 9, or 16 images at once depending on your preference.
2.11 megapixel CCD for photo-quality output up to 8x10 inches on inkjet or dye-sublimation printers
