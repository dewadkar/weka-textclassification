            The Lincoln Town cars is the finest car in the world. It is the pride of the North and the Jewel of the south. At only 22-years old I got my first Town car.  1995 Lincoln Town Car Signature.  I think that the 1995-1997 is the best.  They hold the old style and drive like a dream. Smooth, powerful, fast, super reliable. <br>I lost mine in an accident. A 1994 Dodge Ram 2X4 hit me head on. we were going about 40-m.p.h. The town car is very heavy and safe. If I had been in my Ford Tempo I would have been killed.<br><br>If you like style, value, smooth ride, power, good fuel mileage, and safety, buy a Town Car.  I like the 1995-1997 the best. The new body style has not grown on me yet.(Some day it will)<br><br>Town cars are with out any doubt the best cars on the road. Anyone can easily enjoy driving one for 10-years or more with no problems and with out getting tired of it.  Safety!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Every one should have a Town car. I will buy another one as soon as I am out of college.  Used insurance money to pay rent and tuition.<br><br>Thanks,  Freddy<br><br><br>
