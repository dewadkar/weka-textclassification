            I have had my '98 BMW 528i for approximately two years.  It was my first purchase after law school, and was well worth the price!  It rides smoothly and has a luxurious interior.  It is a quiet car, yet it has amazing power that I definitely feel during those times that I need a little speed!  In the year and a half that I have owned my car, I haven't had ANY mechanical problems, and have only taken my car to the dealership for regular &quot;checkups&quot;.  

I liked the 528i because I wanted a BMW not so much for the speed or driving ability, but for the luxury.  Consequently, I chose the 528i, which is much bigger than the 3 Series, but for not much more money!

I am thrilled with my purchase, and would definitely do it all over again!
