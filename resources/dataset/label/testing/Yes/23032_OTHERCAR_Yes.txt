            I just started using the PDC640 and can't get enough of it.  The download and picture taking aspects are great.  The large optical viewfinder is great for waiting for the right picture without missing what is going on around me.The software that is included is very easy to use and can accomplish much of what you need.  It makes great shots and will save the files for use elsewhere.  The one problem that I had is that it uses batteries very fast.  This is especially true when you are using the viewfinder mode.  I have fixed that with rechargeable batteries.  You can also get a AC adapter for it for when you are downloading.  Over-all I highly recommend checking this one out.<br><br>
