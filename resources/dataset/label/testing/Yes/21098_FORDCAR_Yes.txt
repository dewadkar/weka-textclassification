            We bought this vehicle as a second van for the family.  The first is an Aerostar.  This van is wonderful because it drives like a car not like a truck like other vans.  By this I mean, when you go over a bump, you don't get bounced all around. It also sits lower to the ground than the Aerostar or Astro van, making it easier for seniors to get in and out of. 

 The cargo area is a wonderful size.  There is also a place to put a cargo net so your items won't fall out when you open the hatch.  We have rear air conditioning and controls in this van which I now believe is a MUST!  

 There are plenty of little things like drink holders and cubby holes. The drink holders in the front can be pushed in and out of your way.    I do wish, however that the van had a center console. I also wish that the back seat were just a little wider. This van drives very smoothly and although we bought it used, we have had no mechanical difficulties at all.   

  I believe that you should buy this vehicle if you are looking for a car with a lot of room or carry a lot of passengers with you.  This van carries 7 people.  If you have a family this would be a smart purchase.<br><br>
