            As a previous owner of sports cars, I began seriously researching the Jeep Wrangler back in 1997 when I got tired of being unable to take my mountain bike with me (not to mention scraping bottom at the slightest of road bumps!)  Over 3 years, I read multiple articles, books and so forth.  I also test drove many times and most importantly spoke to every Wrangler owner I could find.  I was sold...I quickly came to know that the Jeep Wrangler was the only vehicle for me!

I'm now the extremely proud owner of a 1999 Wrangler TJ Sport with 5 speed, 30 inch tires, towhooks, and full steel doors (lends a bit of added protection and allows for quick rolling of the windows).  The soft top is incredibly easy for one person to operate.  I've only had the Jeep for 1 week and I can easily get the top up within 10 minutes and down in closer to 5.  If you ever want to hear your stereo, definitely opt for the soundbar...worth every cent.

A quick note for the ladies...As a woman Wrangler owner, I can tell you this vehicle is incredibly fun and lends a great sense of power on the road...I can now travel anywhere!  Contrary to popular belief, the Wrangler community is not just a boy's club.  No one should miss out on this!!  I love my Wrangler and can't imagine ever again driving anything else...I enjoy looking over everyone instead of only at bumpers and tailpipes!!<br><br>
