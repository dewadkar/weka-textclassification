            Four years ago, when my old Camaro died, I needed to purchase a new car. I always liked the Saturn TV ads. They seemed very women-friendly. I did my homework and discovered that they are generally rated well. So, hating the car-buying experience, I set out to the Saturn dealership. 

I was not disappointed. The salespeople were cool, not the typical stereotypical car salespeople. There was absolutely no sales pressure. I was not talked down to because I was a woman. There was none of the price haggling that I loathe. I was simply told, "This is what we charge for the car. This is what we charge for the options. Would you like to buy one?"

I did.

I didn't have a lot of money to put out right then, so I got a base model, with not much added to it. My only gripe was that Saturn doesn't seem to throw in as many bells and whistles as standard equipment as some car companies do. 

Four years later, I still love my car. It gets great gas mileage. It handles nice and tight. It has a surprising amount of zoom for a little car. It has needed no repairs. Even the basic stereo is awesome. I have friends that have put out a lot of money for premium sound systems on their cars. They don't sound as good as mine. 

One of the best features is the dent-proof sides. Despite many whacks by shopping carts and other people's car doors, it still looks pristine. It resists nicks and dents very well.

The only caveat I would offer is that very big or tall people might find it a tight squeeze. I'm 6 feet tall. I don't feel at all cramped in it, but I would imagine that anyone much taller or bigger might. 

I'm no car expert, but for a thirtysomething woman who's had a few cars in her life (and I know a little bit about cars), I'm quite pleased with my Saturn.
