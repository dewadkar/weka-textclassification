            In my 18 years of driving 15 of them have been in Toyota's so I'm speaking from experience when I say this one is the best yet. I've had the 1985 hi-lux solid front axel 22-r work-horse of a truck that I bought new in 85', just traded($5500.00)it for a 2000 V-8 four door TUNDRA!
 I also bought a 95' Tacoma king cab new and sold it in 98'and made a few grand. The point is that Toyota'S don't lose there value.
I love my Tundra and probably will keep this one for the rest of my life, the ride has to be the smoothest of any truck ever. I call it my four wheel drive Cadillac. Off road performance is the best with power to spare, towing on and off road is also no problem. All around it's got to be one of the best trucks ever made by anyone! That motor will pin you back pretty well with minimal loss of traction. 0 to 60 too dawg gone quick! My wife said &quot;you better be careful with this thing,you can't tell how fast you are going&quot;. 
 All I have left to say is if you plan on test driving one you had better go get your loan approved first because you will want to take the truck home with you! I sure did! That is if there are any on the lot they don't seem to sit there for to long before someone grabs them, So you've got to move quick, And if your in a new Tundra you'll have no problem doing that, I promise.
