            Our family just purchased (Aug. 2002) a Jewelcoat Red 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada.  We were able to receive many rebates, discounts and offers that may not be available to other GMC Models like the Envoy and the Trailblazer.

We previously owned a 1998 Oldsmobile Silhouette, so the conversion to a smaller vehicle will have to be sacrificed.  Needless to say, I won't be hauling a Den of Cub Scouts around town anymore - there's room for five passengers with the front seat reserved for those twelve and over (as ALL motor vehicles should be!).

We purchased the vehicle because it has the towing capacity we need to haul a large cabin boat we will be purchasing soon.

We received a REBATE as a "loyal" customer - someone whose last car owned was an Oldsmobile.  We were told we got a letter in the mail, but it was not necessary to have it with us during the purchase - GMC faxed a copy of the letter to the car dealer for verification.

We also received a rebate for opting to go from a 5-year/60,000-mile General Motors Protection Plan to a 3-year/30,000-mile plan.

With the rebates and the trade-in, we saved over $8,000!

After Oldsmobile goes out-of-business in 2004, we can take the SUV to any GMC Dealer for repairs, warranty problems, and recalls. (Buick, Chevrolet, Pontiac)

LUXURY FEATURES

- Leather Bucket Seats with 8-way seat adjustment.

- TravelNote - allows up to three minutes of time to save information into a digital voice recorder.  Leave notes to yourself or to your loved ones.

- Driver Information Center - this is COOL!
This features 22 character message center that can display trip information, fuel economy, and personalization features, or warnings.
You can adjust how the vehicle locks, un-locks, headlights when exiting, perimeter lighting, memory seat position, easy exit seating, tilt mirror in reverse, and other neat stuff.

MY OPINION
Acceleration is unbelievable!  It seems to take off without a lot of effort, but the effort is SMOOTH.

The transmission is easy with the gear shift on the floor.

The drink cups could be better; they are for smaller drinks.  One holder is really close to the gear shift. A drink can get in the way when you place it in PARK.

I especially like the tilt mirror in reverse and easy exit seating.  The side view mirrors can be tilted towards the curb, making the vehicle easier to parallel park or just back down the driveway.  The easy exit makes the driver's chair move back when the ignition is turned off - now that's just plain FUN!

Other epinion reviews will tell you, this is one luxury SUV you don't want to pass up!
