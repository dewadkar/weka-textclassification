            Wife purchased vehicle after last one (1994 Concorde)was totaled (by son).
Primary reasons were ride comfort and roominess.

Ride quality is very good, and handling is surprisingly good for a vehicle of this size.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone whose primary concern is roominess and a quality ride.

The only problems to date have been with the transmission.  There was a trouble light that was lighting up occasionally.....when checked, it was determined to be connected with the torque converter.  Eventually, the transmission was rebuilt (at the dealership), and the trouble light has not come on again.
There are 30 thousand miles on the car, and it now needs a new set of brakes (it seems to be too soon to replace them, but what can you do?)<br><br>
