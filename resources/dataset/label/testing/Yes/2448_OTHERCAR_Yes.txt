            Toyota has greatly improved the new Tacoma. The new styling not only looks great but new function is also there. On the outside there is new body design, which includes fender flares, vertical grill and hood shape. All of these give the Tacoma a stronger look. On the inside they finally got around to moving the cup holder. It is no longer over the radio and temperature controls. There is one adjustable holder behind the shift and in front of the center armrest. There are also two additional cup holders along the passenger side of the center drive shaft. One of the most interesting new features is the white gages. Not only are the easier to read they look pretty cool. I use to have a 1987 Toyota truck, the new 2001 truck has kept all of the good features of the 1987 and improved on the bad. I also currently have a 1997 4runner and I find myself comparing it with the Tacoma as well. The Tacoma defiantly feels lighter and there for a little less stable then the 4runner. However the 4runner does have the 15in tires where the Tacoma has 16 and the 4runner also has wide tires. I want to put wider tires on the Tacoma so I am going to see if that improves the handling. Over all the Tacoma is a great truck though. There is plenty of horsepower for the 4-cylinder engine, I haven't had a chance to see towing or hauling power but if it is anything like my old pickup it should be no problem.<br><br>
