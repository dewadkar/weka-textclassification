            OK....so you want a sports car that looks great and performs like a dream, but you don't want to spend a fortune? Well my friend, your prayers have been answered! The new Toyota Celica GTS is all that and a bag of chips.

I've been impressed w/ the new Celica since day one. The first time I saw it on the road I told myself I would have to find out what that car was! So since the 2000 model I've wanted one. When the 2001 model came out(which is the same as the 2000 model, no changes have been made) I decided to go for it!

Looking at the outside of the vehicle, its sharp lines and dramatic look make the car look fast even when standing still. If you look closely you can tell that Toyota puts great effort into the finished product. The fit and finish is absolutely superb. All lines are perfect, no slack at all...everything matches up perfectly. Sitting inside the car, I felt like i was in the cokpit of an F-18. Most controls are within good reach with the exception of the hazard light and instrument dimmer switch. The quality and textures of materials used are up to standard Toyota quality. The one interior feature I admired the most were the Recaro style seats. I'm a tall guy..and for once a manufacturer has designed a seat that can actually support me, and have a headrest that actually reaches to my head! I went w/ the leather interior which is of great quality and comfort. Overall...the interior makes you feel like you've just purchased an expensive sports car.

Finally, the drive! As soon as I fired up the engine I knew this was going to be a great ride. Toyota isn't kidding about the 180 hp VVTL-i engine. I was actually pushed back in my seat by this little 4 cylinder, which by the way impresses the heck out of import and domestic sports car owners alike. With the 180 hp engine being linked to a 6 speed manual transmission, the ride only gets better. The transmission feels a lot like the 1995 MR2's...a short throw,with solid gear changes. The clutch takes a bit of getting used to, its not as heavy as most sports cars like it...but who's complaining? The suspension is just stiff enough that taking corners at generally high speeds, yet it doesn't rock your kidneys on surface streets. The large front ventilated discs w/ the optional ABS provides excellent stopping power.

Now for some bad points. The rear seat is a bit cramped for rear passengers, but you can't expect too much from a sports car. Also the color of the instrument panel and the center console controls are different...it would have been nice to have it all match. One last down-point is the moon roof. It's a bit noisy when open since there is no wind deflector. A nice touch would have been a built in one that pops up like on the BMW's.

Overall I am greatly pleased with my new Celica, and I feel pretty good about my purchase. I am always getting complements on the vehicle, and even better, I can't stop giving it compliments. At a price of $22,788 before tax and license, my pocket book feels pretty good too!
