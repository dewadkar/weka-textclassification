            In August we purchased this camera from Sears and since then it has become my husband's camera. He never really took interest in actually taking pictures with any of our cameras, but this is his.  We had looked around at quite a few and for the price this had a lot of great features. 

 We went on vacation in October and with the 10x zoom we were able to take some really great photos.  we were with friends and we were able to make a copy of the photos right on the spot for them to take back home.  

It is quite easy to operate and did not take too long to get the feel for the camera.  The fact that you can easily operate this made it very worthwhile and it is also very light to carry. 

 It is not very large and it uses regular 3.5 floppy discs. The battery recharges very quickly and it lasted a full day so that we plugged it in at night and in the morning it was ready to go. 

 I have seen cameras that use a special disc and you can't view your pictures and they are not worth the bother.  With this camera you can take a picture, view it and if you don't like it you can delete it immediately.  You do not have to download to a computer and when you are traveling you just bring some floppies and start snapping.   <br><br>
