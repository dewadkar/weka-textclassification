            Dear sports car fans,
    The Mustang is the all around wanted car. Your grandfather told stories of how when he turned 16 his dream car was a Mustang, and as hard as it can be to believe, teens still go on about how they want a Mustang. This car has been wanted through the ages and isn't just some here-and-gone-next-year fad. This classy car has lasted through the ages and it's not hard to tell why.
    One of the reasons it might of lasted so long is because of it's sleek body style. Yes, looks DO matter to the designers of this vehicle. As if that wasn't enough to sell the Mustang they put in a V-8 engine that runs smoothly and quietly.
    This vehicle is the perfect one for city dwellers, but it might not be so hot for country folk. The Mustang can't drive very well on gravel roads because of how low it is to the ground. Another let down is that it doesn't hold very many people.
    So, yes, it has its down points, but the engine and looks have this sleek sports car kept in my heart.<br><br>
