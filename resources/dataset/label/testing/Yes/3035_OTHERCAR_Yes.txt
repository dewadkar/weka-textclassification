                 The Acuras have always been some of the greatest cars in the upper-end, all-around great category. The 2000 model is no exception - it is fun, VERY reliable, does not guzzle gas like some Suburban, and most importantly (for me, at least) - it can easily and cheaply be turned into a Ferrari with the help of a HUGE aftermarket industry! 
     The car has all the best qualities of the previous Integras - it is well-balanced, has very precise steering control, and of course, the great VTEC! The only thing that saddens me in this car is the styling - although some may like the look, I personally prefer the more &quot;digital&quot; design of the 1993 model, with its wide and narrow headlights. But to me, styling can take second place when there's 195 horsepower under the hood, easily upgraded to 230 and up. I already started on customizing my Type R by upgrading the exhaust, wheels, and intake. Racing suspension is next!
    Driving impressions: Great, great, great!!! The car feels light when you press the right pedal and very solid going through corners - it is not hard to throw it into a rear-end skid when you know what you're doing! In general, I'd say that to truly enjoy driving this car you have to be an enthusiast of high-output inline-4 engines. If your true love is a 69 Camaro with 4 liters of gas-burning displacement, then the Integra is not for you. Driving this Honda-powered toy is all about high-RPM's, redline gearshifts (don't even THINK about getting an auto on it - you won't experience half the fun and look like a poseur), and back-cracking corners. So, spoiled brats, this car is NOT for you. Get a Mustang or one of those over-hyped New Bugs.
