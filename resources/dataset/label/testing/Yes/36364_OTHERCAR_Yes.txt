            I confess...I'm a Toyota guy. I have had Supras, Camrys, MR2s and Celicas. However, I've owned a 1987 Accord too so I'll try my best to be as unbiased as possible.

This review is for a 1994 Accord EX sedan (2 door) with leather. My car is Maroon, and has 99K miles on it. I bought the car almost a year ago and it is, beyond doubt, the best used car I have ever owned. 

Let me start with the car's annoyances first. The gas gauge does not read accurately at all. When you fill it up, it read 7/8 full. At 1/2 full you still have 3/4 of a tank remaining. The clutch has a chatter or shutter for the first few minutes you operate it (oh yeah, I've got a 5-speed). And finally, there is some kind of light exhaust buzz at 1750 - 1800 rpm. That's it. Yep, that's it!

I don't have enough room to wax eloquent about all of its attributes. Suffice it to say that it's a wonderful blend of road manners, comfort, gas mileage and reliability. I forgot power? Yeah, I did. Well, having had a Toyota Supra turbo it's kinda hard to compare. Needless to say, the 145 hp 4-cylinder is, how should I say, "adequate". But then again, I didn't buy it for 0 to 60...

Expect about 27-28 mpg in suburban driving and 32 (Summer) to 34 (Winter) mpg on the highway. Expect excellent finish and fit and expect world-class reliability. 

What can I say? It's a Honda. It's much better than the 87 I used to own and the 87 was better than everything else on the market at its price range. Ditto for the 94.
