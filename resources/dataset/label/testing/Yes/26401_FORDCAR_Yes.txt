            Ok, all you MEN out there, dreading the thought of driving (argghhh) or owning (oh nooooo!) a minivan??  Well, after having our second child, my wife wanted something to replace our aging (14 yr old) Honda with a bunch of miles on it (230k+).

Of course, I was very resistant at first because I didn't want to drive this slow, ponderous behemoth of a vehicle around.  I felt I was justified - &quot;Minivans are emasculating..&quot;, I said, &quot;They're slow and the suck gas..&quot;  And worst of all.. They SCREAM &quot;FAMILY!!&quot;  I didn't think I could handle it.

Nevertheless, my wife convinced me to test drive a few vans, starting with a Mazda MPV (too slow and tippy feeling, plus no side impact beams until '94).  I'd driven Dodge Caravans (weak engine, questionable reliability) and Toyota Minivans (ugly and expensive.  Weak motor 4-cylinder) before and I hated them.  They were usually ugly or they were slow or both.  We even looked at a new Honda Odyssey, but man, you're looking at top dollar for those!

We then looked at a 95 Ford Windstar (7-pass, dual air, 155Hp 3.8 motor).  The looks were not too objectionable and it had every bell and whistle, but, as I suspected the engine was weak and I said no.  We wandered around for awhile, testing other options such as a 4 door sedan, but nothing really grabbed me until I test drove a 200HP-equipped 98 Windstar.  When I first got in, I figured it'd be the same as the 95, but it was in better condition, had fewer miles and was a more pleasing color.  Besides, the wife pleaded me to try it.  Wow, what a difference!  This van had a 3.8 litre motor like the 95, but it was WORLDs apart in power.  

To make a long story short, we ended up with a 96 Windstar with the same 200HP motor (identifiable by the SPLIT PORT INDUCTION sticker (available only 1996 and on) on its intake manifold) and we've had it for a year now.

It has been reliable and comfortable and I have a few gripes still, but I regularly embarrass kids in their &quot;Rice rockets&quot; from signal to signal.  Yes, the seats are a bit soft and the handling isn't like a sports-car, but for a family hauler, it has guts and can chirp its tires easily.

For utility, it can't be beat.  I have done everything from haul garbage to the dump to carry a full load (7 persons) of passengers around town and I have no complaints about its straight-line performance.<br><br>
