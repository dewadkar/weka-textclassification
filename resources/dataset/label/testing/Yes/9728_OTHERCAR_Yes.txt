            I've been appointed the task to purchase 5 new Digital cameras for a work project.  As usual I have the joy of going through each brand and model to find the best.  The Sony DSC-770 is a very high-quality camera, with some hefty consequences. 

First of all the camera takes great pictures!  It's got a 1.5Megapixel image (indistinguishable from a regular film photograph).  It includes 5x zoom, a feature I love, and a manual focus to selectively blur out the people you don't like.  The camera has a nice viewfinder outside of it, which works great unless you are in direct sunlight, as with all LCD viewfinders, you can't see anything.  A feature which makes this camera a bit more professional is it's White Balancing feature.  It enables you to adjust the colors before you shoot, and even with a flash option, so you can count on perfectly balanced and natural colors all the way through. 

A couple features that are cool on this that are a little more unique, is the 2fps rapid shoot.  That will let you take photos at a time of 2 per second automatically.  This is cool for simple time lapse.  

Images are saved as TIFF of JPEG, you save as TIFF for high-quality no-loss and JPEG for compressed images.  Both look great, but I'd save TIFF for prints.  The memory cards are easy enough to pull in and out, and the pc-link is great.  Being my first shot at loading/unloading digital images to my PC it was a piece of cake.  That may be because I'm so used to Digital Video and scanning, but I'm sure anyone else would find it simple enough with the cables and software supplied. 

Overall this is a great camera, a bit out of price range for most people, and should be saved for techies that want high-quality and don't want to fuss with film.
