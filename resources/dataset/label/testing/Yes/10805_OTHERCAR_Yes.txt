            I received the Camera a couple of days ago, and I am still amazed of the features packed in it!!!!!  I was convinced that the Camera was larger than it is, IT IS VERY SMALL!!!!!!!

It work very well and it is a very capable Digital Camera, having almost every feature of the other ones (Excluding a mechanical zoom and a large capacity smartmedia card), but it's shortcomings are overwhelmed by the other list of features, including the MP3, which sounds amazing.

If you are getting the camera, go ahead and buy the 64 meg Smartmedia card and that is all you need to have a great and versatile package to carry around!!!!!!!!!
