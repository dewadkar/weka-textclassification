            I bought my 95 Mazda 626 used, there had been one owner, so I figured it was still a pretty good car. It's beautiful on the outside, I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. The inside is comfortable, there is room for 5 people easily. The car ran great until about two months after I bought it. The gears started skipping, and once you got over 65mph the car shook violently. I took my car to a mechanic to get fixed. It cost almost $1500 to fix. It also took a long time, because its very hard to find mazda parts. When my car is running good, most of the time, I love it. It drives like a sports car, it corners well, and can handle any speed test you put in under. If you want a good dependable car, go for it, I love mine....<br><br>
