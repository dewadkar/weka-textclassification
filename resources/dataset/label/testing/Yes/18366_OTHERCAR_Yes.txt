            I have owned station wagons for years and have always been a "cruiser" with a family that likes to have room. When it came time to get rid of my '86 Caprice wagon (God, I loved that car!) I settled on the 99 Villager Estate. 

As a man, I'd rather be driving a pickup or a coupe but as a father this van is plenty. The air handling and entertainment systems are excellent. I don't mind at all being seen behind the wheel of this car!

Acceleration and braking are good, steering is tight enough for a vehicle this size, keeping in mind I'm used to driving land yachts. Road/tire noise is not unacceptably high; if the driver's window is open, though, it's kind of hard to hear the stereo. 

I do have a couple of complaints. The seats are comfortable, but the seat belts inexplicably lock up on their wearers. This can be most uncomfortable, especially for the little ones. The rear seat and mid captain's chairs are very tough to get out as they require both hands to unlatch (you have to be in the vehicle sitting/squatting behind them) and the sliding side doors open exactly - no space for knuckles! - wide enough to get them out. 

Overall, we cruise smoothly, and happily, with reasonable mileage and no mechanical snafus. 

P.S. You must make a point to open up and check your back lights, say when you check your oil. Water seeps in and corrodes the contacts on the light bulbs on the brake and rear turning lamps, and they may burn out on you unexpectedly. Mr. State Trooper was not amused by a van full of kids on the expressway with no brake/taillights except for the high center.
