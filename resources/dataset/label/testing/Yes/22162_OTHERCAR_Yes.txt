            This is my first car and I really can't say enough about it, it is a great car. The power is unbelievable. I have only lost one race on the road, and, considering I am a 17 year old teenage guy, i do that alot. Don't get me wrong, i have not only raced escorts and cavaliers, i've actually raced an older mustang (not 5.0 of course) newer eclipse and several other cars that you wouldn't expect a 13 year old car to beat. My only loss was to an integra GSR that i was guessing was really hooked up. It KILLED me but i soon regained my pride. But, there are a couple of things that need to be discussed. I have put good money into this car. Since I've had it (about a year now) i've replaced the water pump ($250), cam sensor($150), brakes ($250), and tires ($400). Now, granted, that is a lot of money and i do only have a part time job and am paying my $140 a month insurance bill (even the insurance company agrees that the car is fast). But, the good things far outweigh the fact that i have put a lot of money into it. First of all, my car is ABSOLUTELY LOADED! It has leather, power driver seat, power mirrors, power windows, power steering, power brakes, power sunroof, power locks, 4-wheel disc brakes, 3.8L V6, floor-mounted 4 speed automatic transmission (i think the floor-mounted is very important because my friend has an 88 regal that is almost exactly the same except hers is not as loaded and she has a steering column shifter and i hate it), 16" rims (not hubcaps), 2 doors, power trunk release, 6 speaker stereo system (which i replaced with a very nice aftermarket clarion/polk/infinity system for $500), cruise control, vanity lights, rear-window defroster, and electronic guages. That is a long list of features including some that farely expensive NEW cars do not have. I am very happy knowing that my parents and most of my friends' cars do not even come close to the types of features that mine has. The electronic guages are also very nice because you can just glance and see the speed(which i've had up to 112 MPH) and RPM and you don't have to actually analyze like on most traditional analog cars. Now, don't take me for the safety advocate but it takes half the time to look at the electronic guages on my car than it does on analog ones and that second can be very crucial in certain situations. Now, the wierd things. The car sometimes makes some funny noises. For a while i hear a noise coming from my right front suspension components whenever i went over a bump, almost like something was rubbing and i had my mechanic look it over and he said that he didn't see anything. But the very wierd thing is that the sound has gone away and come back and is currently not there. Also, whenever i took off there would be an interesting almost rubbing (like two bones rubbing) sound under the driver's seat, but that is also mercurial. So, these types of things make me worry some times, but that's just me, it's probably nothing. Also, the electronics are funky. When i first bought the car, the previous owner told me that the air conditioning did not work. And, when i test drove it, it didn't. But, now, it does, explain that to me. Also, the stereo system (factory) began to make a very loud almost static noise occassionaly. It must've been the radio because i replaced the speakers and still heard the noise but when i replaced the receiver, it worked fine. Also, the power mirrors. When i first bought the car the passenger's side power mirror did not work, but then it started to. Now, neither of them work, again, explain that one to me. Besides the little quirks and occassional problems, this car is great for anyone, especially first time buyers.
