            I come from a long line of truck owners.  We have bought Dodge for as long as I could remember.  But I wanted a car for traffic situations.  So I did some research.  About 45 hours to be exact.. All before I found out about epinions unfortunatly, but anyway.  

I bought a Saturn SL2 4-door..It is black with gold flakes in the paint. (not real gold of course)  It has leather interior, A/C, fold down rear seats and a huge trunk.. I bought it with a tape deck (there was one just like it with a CD player for 350 more.)  This is so I can play me MP3's with a tape adapter.

Off the lot,
The dealership is right on US75 in Richarson (near Dallas), so right off the lot I had to merge into traffic.  This car fits me like a glove.  I just stepped on the pedel and before I knew it I had forgotten that I was in a new car. The mirrors were perfect. The seat was perfect.  And most of all when I stepped the car moved.  There was no delay I was at 70 mph with hardly no wait.

I was worried about having a 4-door but that qualm was squelched in two ways.. The performance on US 75 and in my insurance bill. The two door model would have cost me 200 dollars more (I am 23 and male)....

The only real gripe (and it is not Saturns fault) is that I have a automatic transmission.. I perfer a mannul.  My dealer called around to find me one, and I did searches on the internet to find one but no luck.. The closest one was in Washington DC.  So Automatic it was...

This car is a great car.  The leather is a nice touch and the power is awesome.  And as for the price...A car this good would be 11 to 12k but was a small 9k.  The kicker is the 96 only had 40,000 miles on it..for 9k. WOW.. I love Saturn.<br><br>
