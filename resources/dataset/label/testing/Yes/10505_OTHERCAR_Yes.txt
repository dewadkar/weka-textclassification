            The Acura TL Sedan is simply an incredible car.  Let me first point out that this car competes, and then some with the likes of Mercedez Benz, Audi A6, Lexus, and the BMW 3 Series.  In my honest opinion, it blows the doors off all of them.  The Acura TL offers legendary quality of build, and fit and finish.  Honda/Acura has done an incredible job once again.  The car has the most powerful standard engine in it's class.  The engine is Honda's 3.2L VTEC Engine.  This is a powerful engine, that runs extremely quiet.  I kid you not, if you have the radio on, it would be hard to tell if the car engine was running, until you slam on the accelerator, and your neck snaps back.  

This car has an exceptional level of luxury.  With the only option being the DVD driven navigation system, you get a lot of toys.  Dual heated leather bucket seats in the front.  The Tip-tronic style automatic transmission is neat too.  The instrument cluster is complete, and well layed out.  Gauges are large, and ledgible.  You set yourself behind the wheel and you feel like you are within reach of everything.  The Center Console is very Honda Accord like.  I like it, and find it to be an elegant yet simple layout.  The controls on the Bose premium sound system are large, and easy to get at.  Not to forget the stereo controls mounted on the steering wheel as well.  The only piece of the interior that I found to being cheap looking were the doorlocks, in the &quot;chrome&quot; color, and the switch on the driver's side for locking power windows.  These are small complaints, and minor.  You could live in the front bucket seats of this car.  Plenty of headroom, even with the moon roof.  The back seat is not too bad for comfort either.

Exterior styling is a bit like the Honda Accord, but more upscale.  There is a sport package available with a rear spoiler and ground effects, and fancier wheels.  It looks a bit over done.  This car has nice clean looks with out all that extra plastic.  

What I hate about this car.  Hmmm, tough call.  I had a faulty sensor in for my side air bag.  I kept getting a warning light on the dash.  The dealer came to my office and picked the car up and replaced the sensor.  That really is about it.  The car rides and performs great.  I kill myself laughing when I see people driving Lexus's, or Infinitys.  The Acura is at the very least the equal to every car in the class, if not superior.  Best of all, it is offered for thousands of dollars less!  Infact, Anyone considering the Accord V6 should look at this car.  The diffrence in price isn't that great, considering the car!<br><br>
