            I began taking digital pictures to sell items on Ebay.  My first digital camera was a Polaroid 640 which worked fine for low resolution pictures, but only allowed about 12 pictures on the memory card at a time.  After becoming accustomed to the digital format, I wanted something that would not limit the number of pictures that I could take in one session.  I was also looking for a megapixel camera.

After looking at several cameras, I decided that I liked the Sony Mavica format.  I first purchased the MVC-FD75 for about $475, but took it back the next day when I found that the picture quality was no different in essence than my inexpensive Polaroid and so I could not justify the cost.  

I then checked out the different models of Mavicas and bit the bullet, paying about $800 for the MVC-FD88.  My camera includes a 16x zoom lens, a macro feature, and a lot of different settings for everything from shooting in low light to creating effects such as sepia pictures.  There is also an MPEG feature which will allow you to make a short 1 minute movie, however, I have not used that feature.  I also purchased a generic camera case--$10, that fits the Mavica rather than the true Mavica case.  I chose the generic so as to avoid advertising the fact that I had a Mavica strapped to my shoulder when traveling.  I also purchased a second battery and charger to increase the amount of time that I could shoot pictures so that I could leave one charger at home and take one with me when I travel after forgetting my charger on a tip.

To get the best performance from this camera, you really need to practice and read the web site.  Also, I would not view a digital camera as a replacement for my 35 mm camera.  There are needs and uses for both.

Though the camera is bulky, I was willing to give on size to have the availability of using 3.5 floppy disks as my storage medium.  They are inexpensive and can be found anywhere when traveling.  The camera will even reformat 3.5 floppies that are formatted for use with Mac's if that is all that is available.

I was initially disappointed with this camera and the picture quality that I was achieving.  Since I belong to a board for other Ebay sellers, I asked for help with this camera and received several great hints for use.  One of the most helpful answers contained a web site URL for people with Mavica's which contained so much helpful information that overnight I was snapping great quality pictures!  That site is:  http://sharpwebpage.com/MavicaQ&A/MavicaQ&A.html

My best hints for using this camera are to protect the LCD screen because it scratches easily which will make taking photos very difficult.  Though LCD screen protectors are available for purchase, I cut a square from the cardboard box that the camera came in and taped it to the back of the camera.  This serves the dual purpose of protecting the LCD display and giving me a shade when I am working in bright light.

Next, since the flash is so very very strong, even on low, I use frosted scotch tape across the flash to diffuse the light of the flash and reduce picture "hot spots".  Depending on the level of light and closeness, I might use as many as 6 layers of tape, but it gives wonderful results and is very economical.

Also, it is very important that you have good light in which to photograph.  If you are photographing still objects, use some sort of spot lights.  When photographing in low light situations, I have found that using the manual focus is best as the camera seems to have a hard time with automatic focus if the subject is not brightly lit.

Taking photos when using the zoom to the max is difficult if hand held.  It is best to use a tripod or to set the camera on something solid if you wish to use the 16x zoom.

With the macro feature I have taken some truly stunning photos of tiny items with this camera.  People often ask what camera I have because the pictures are so good!  

It has been great for use with my genealogy.  I have taken excellent shots of old photos, documents, buildings, etc. as I have traveled.  With genealogy, as with many situations, you may not get the chance to return for a second chance at a picture if your photo doesn't turn out well and with my Mavica, I know right away if I have a good, usable shot of the item unlike a regular camera which was always a little "iffy" for me when copying something as small as a photo or as fine as a document.

I love the fact that all I have to do is grab a bundle of floppies and head out for a day of snapping pictures.  I can get about 15 pictures on a floppy when using 640 x 480 fine resolution.  I can get about 4 pictures on a floppy when using 1280 x 960 fine.  There is also a 1024 x 768 resolution which allows for about 10 pictures per floppy.

The fact that this camera takes no special cords or software to download the pictures is a definite plus.  When traveling or when I wish to share pictures, the floppy can be placed in any computer that has software that reads a .jpg format.  It's a snap and FAST to download the pictures into the computer and print them out.

The many effects that are available with the camera are a lot of fun to use.  I am particularly fond of the sepia and I like the b&w option as well.  The solorize and negative effects are just a lot of fun.

The camera comes with photo software, however, I prefer to just use my Paint Shop Pro 7 to manipulate my pictures and print them when I am at home.  

Overall, I would recommend my Mavica.  It won't replace my 35 mm, but it takes great pictures and is very flexible and since the floppies are so economical, it is quite simple to keep the photos once they are taken, which is not realistic with the memory cards and memory sticks.  If you really want a versatile digital, this is the one!
