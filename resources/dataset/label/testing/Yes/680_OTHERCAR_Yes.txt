            I've been using my 950 for 4 months.
Primary uses:
	photo's of my daughter (now 11mo old)
	documentation of surgical procedures(xrays and subjects)
	photo input for powerpoint presentations
Strengths:
	good image quality
	auto whitebalance does reasonable job
	swivel design is rugged so far and very useful for shooting in aukward
		positions.  Definately a plus.
	battery life is excellent.  With NiMH rechargables I can shoot over a 
		flash photos.
Cons:
	Severe Red Eye problems with the flash.  It is almost colinear with the lens and the pre &quot;flash&quot; is ineffective and creates a lag, bad for candids.
	Most photos need a tweak from photoshop to really look good.  Autolevel and Unsharp mask together work best.
	Serial download speed even on my mac, &gt;220bps is intolerably slow.  CF reader is a must.  USB support like Kodak's would be nice.
	The built in flash tends to wash out the subjects, but external flash support is good if  you have a nikon flash.

Overall, It serves my purposes well, but you need the CF reader, you need to tweak in photoshop, and you have to fix red eye.<br><br>
