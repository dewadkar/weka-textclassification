            Chevrolet has recently unveiled its new 2002 Trailblazer to the delight of SUV lovers everywhere. This new vehicle is supposedly going to replace the Blazer (although there are still 2002 models of the Blazer being manufactured), a Chevrolet icon that has been around for decades. Trailblazer is similar to the Blazer in size (they are both considered midsize SUV�s) but the vehicle itself has been revamped, for the new model year, 2002.

<b>Features:</b>

Trailblazer comes in three trim levels: LS, LT, and LTZ, and each model is available in either 2- wheel drive or 4- wheel drive. The engine is a powerful 4.2 liter, with 270 horsepower, on all models. The dimensions of the Trailblazer are slightly larger than the Blazer. Measuring the length of the Trailblazer yields a total of about 192 inches (16 feet), the width is 74.6 inches (6 feet, 2.6 inches), and the height is 74.5 inches (6 feet, 2.5 inches). All of these dimensions are slightly larger than the old Blazer, but the one that is most noteworthy is the height. I could really tell a difference, when I stepped into the back seat of a Trailblazer. There was a lot more headroom than the Blazer offered. This increase in height might concern some potential buyers who worry that the chances for rollover are greater, but I didn�t feel any sensation of �tipping�, when I drove the vehicle. I haven�t read any test statistics on this, so I can only assume that it�s just as safe as the Blazer. 

The curb weight of the Trailblazer is about 4,440 pounds for the 2- wheel drive units and 4,630 pounds for the 4- wheel drive units. Cargo volume is 41 cubic feet for all trim levels, with seats up (more than 80 cubic feet with the seats down). Towing capacity is pretty good- about 6,200 pounds maximum. Fuel economy is not so great: only 16 mpg in the city and 22 on the highway, but this is right in line with the competition. 

All trim levels come with the standard 3-year, 36,000 mile basic warranty. The powertrain is also covered by the same warranty, and the warranty against rust corrosion is good for 72 months or 100,000 miles. 

Of the three trim levels, the LS offers the least options, LT is in the middle, and LTZ is the top of the line. All three models come complete with standard equipment like air conditioning, power windows and locks, AM/FM radio with CD player, tilt steering wheel, luggage rack, and a few others. With the LT and LTZ models, you also have additional options like leather seats (standard in the LTZ), cruise control, power seats,  rear window defroster, retractable cargo cover, overhead storage, and remote keyless entry. In the LTZ, the audio system comes standard with AM/FM radio, CD player, <i>and</i> cassette player. With the other two, cassette is an option. 

<b>Handling/Ride:</b>

Trailblazer has a 6- cylinder engine. There is no option to get 8- cylinders. Nevertheless, I found that the 4.2 liter, 270 horsepower engine provided plenty of power. Trailblazer doesn�t have land- missle power, like you experience in a high performance sports car. But, for a large vehicle like this, the acceleration is very good. Braking is adequate, with this SUV. It takes a good push on the pedal, but the anti- lock brakes stop the vehicle in a relatively short distance, compared to the competition.

The steering of the Trailblazer is a little bit rough. I say a <i>little</i>, because I tend to compare it to the steering of a sports car, which is what I�m accustomed to driving. Compared to other SUV�s that I have driven, the steering is acceptable. The ride is not rough at all, despite the steering. I felt it was very smooth, even when making a sharp turn. 

<b>Final Thoughts:</b>

Chevrolet Trailblazer is a very good, rugged- looking SUV, with all the features that you expect in a mid- sized sport utility vehicle. The retail price, depending on model and options selected, ranges from about $25,500 to $33,000 or more for a fully- loaded LTZ model. 

One thing that was overlooked on this vehicle is having the option of a third passenger seat. The 2002 Ford Explorer <i>does</i> offer this, and I�m a little surprised that the engineers at Chevrolet failed to make a third seat an option with the Trailblazer. I�ve read somewhere that they <i>are</i> going to offer this on next year�s edition, but that could prove to be a little too late. Those who want extra passenger seating might just skip over the Chevrolet Trailblazer and go with Ford instead, rather than wait another year for this option. 

Overall, this is a solid vehicle, with lots of cargo space for hauling and a good amount of power. It�s definitely a step above the old Blazer and it should have no trouble competing with the Ford Explorer (unless you really want that third seat!), Honda Passport, Toyota 4Runner, or Nissan Pathfinder. I don�t like it quite as much as the Dodge Durango, but the 2002 Trailblazer is still every bit as good as the other competition.
