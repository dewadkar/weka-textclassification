            The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-U30 is made for the person who wants to take a camera with you most of the time that is easy to carry along. The camera will fit easily in a shirt pocket or a purse being 3 3/8 inches x 1 3/16 inches x 1 5/8 inches and weighs only 4.3 ounces. The camera is also good for the beginner who want a point & shoot camera that needs no manual adjustments. 

The DSC-U30 is 2.0 megapixel digital camera that takes some nice photos and it can also take movies for you. It is designed for quick action use by sliding the front lens cover over which powers on the camera and then in just a few seconds it is ready to be used. This camera powers up faster than the digital cameras with built in zoom lenses. 


<b>~~~ The Pluses ~~~</b>
The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-U30 has lot of nice features starting with a <b>retail price of $199</b> which is sure to come down in price when the newness wares off.

This little camera offers you the <b>choice of three different colors,</b> silver, blue and charcoal gray. Now you have a choice of more than one color.

A big plus in my book is the <b>included two AAA Rechargeable NiMH Batteries and Battery Charger.</b> I do recommend buying two more AAA NiMH batteries so you have a second set charged up and ready to go if the other set dies on you.

The DSC-U30 has <b>great photo quality</b> for a 2.0 megapixel camera with two resolutions to choose from, 640 x 480 or 1632 x 1224. The photos are <b>taken rather fast</b> with the 640 x 480 mode it can take 2 photos per second and with the 1632 x 1224 mode it takes them at around one second per photo. These fast times are with the flash off, with the flash on it can add several second per shot.

I love the <b>lens cover</b> that slides to open the camera lens and turn it on. The camera turns off when the cover is placed back over the lens. This is a nice feature because you do not have to worry about keeping up with a lens cover. 

This is no big deal for me but if you want to <b>take movies</b> it will let you take them in a resolution of 160 x 112. The movies are small on the screen but the quality is pretty good.

A <b>One Step USB photo transfer</b> from the camera to your computer. Once you load the provided software, all you have to do is plug the camera up to your computer and it automatically loads the photos to the directory you have picked. This is true plug & play with fast results.


<b>~~~ The Minuses ~~~</b>
My biggest disappointment was <b>not having an optical zoom</b> built in. They don&#146t even give you a digital zoom! This is truly a point & shoot camera with a fixed lens. 

Another complaint I have is with about all digital cameras and that is they never give you enough storage. The DSC-U30 comes with an <b>8MB Memory Stick</b> which gives you 15 photos in the best resolution and around 80 photos in the lower resolution. This is not too bad on photos but in the movie mode it will eat up 8MB very fast. They should have included at least a 32MB memory stick.

The camera is new and they give it a <b>USB 1.1</b> which in my book should be the newer and faster USB of 2.0.

<b>No audio included</b>, what good is a movie without any sound?

There is <b>no optical viewfinder</b> which comes in handy under bright outdoor conditions. 

The <b>LCD is too small</b> at 1 inch; for me it is hard to see with.

<b>~~~ Overall ~~~</b>
The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-U30 comes with everything to get you started from the CD with software to the rechargeable batteries. For a retail price of $199 you are ready to take some nice digital photos.

For the main part of the camera &#147Photo Quality&#148 it is excellent in both modes. The camera is very fast from when you slide open the lens cover to when you shoot your first shot. The camera is easy to use and understand. This is basically an easy to use point & shoot camera that needs no setting to use. 

Photos turned out great but when using the flash I had to stay within about 5 feet to get a good clear photo shot. This camera is best under good lighting conditions.

Using the high setting of 1632 x 1224 produces some very nice 4 x 6 inch photo prints. I printed up a couple 8 x 10 inch prints and they also turned out pretty good. I shot some photos in the 640 x 480 mode and the 4x 6 inch prints come out fairly well but in a 8 x 10 inch print it didn&#146t do as good. I recommend using the higher resolution all the time. 

As far as movies, well they look pretty good but they are very small on the computer screen and not having any sound really bugs me. The movie size is a good small size if you wanted to e-mail them to someone. 

Overall it takes good photos but it is a camera for a beginner and not for me!
