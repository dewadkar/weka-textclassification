            The audi TT....yes, that is the car that was driven by the beautiful woman in this summer's Mission Impossible 2.  I fell in love with this car the second i let the clutch out.  This sporty 2 seat roadster that i was ever so lucky to come to own is one of a kind on the road today (even though my friends tell me it looks a bit like a squashed vw bug).  A guarantee to turn heads, get honks and yells of admiration.  

My 235 hp Quattro roadster model takes me on a real 'ride' every time.   (this is a good thing).  Its six speeds shift with beauty and grace...the only sad part being the initial ummph from stand still untill one gets up to around 2500 rpm  at which time the turbo kicks in.  The brakes are a bit sensitive at first, but this was soon fixed as i got used to the pressure.  I hate driving other people's cars now because i forget that it can't corner like mine or maneuver through rush hour.  

This is the perfect car for anyone looking for a quality ride, and doesnt mind sacrificing space. ... a good 'weekend' vehicle for those of us who have only one friend that they'd like to take along...and one doesnt need to sacrifice music quality to have the top down with the bose sound option<br><br>
