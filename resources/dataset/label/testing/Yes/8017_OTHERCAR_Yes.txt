            Bought our '97 from the first owner with 40K on it for $9K. Put new Michelin X1's all around and new front Monroe Sensatrac struts. Also needed new battery. Orig. owners did maintenance by the book so the van runs great.

This is our first van and we love it! Just like a big cadillac after driving hard pounding SUV's and two door sport coupes. Getting in our 1 and 3 year olds is a breeze...and we still have room to carry Grandparents and stroller.

3.3 engine has a lot of power...I own a hot rod and am impressed with torque...some guys are even starting to hot rod these vans and I see why.

Two biggest concerns: headlight illumination is terrible so I'm adding Sylvania 9007XV bulbs...they made a huge difference on our Olds car. It also helps to aim them higher...no one has flashed their "highs" at me yet.

Second is airbag light is on but goes off occassionally. Have heard this could be a safety defect due to the clockspring cable fraying. Other older models had a airbag recall on harness and Dodge trucks also had airbag insulation recall. Hope they claim mine...or it's a $400 repair from what I've heard.

Other minor gripe is air filter location. This is a two hour job to replace. Located on BOTTOM of engine bay near front spoiler. Read about how someone went thru deep puddle and damaged engine...can see why as this would suck up any water higher than  bottom of front bumper.
