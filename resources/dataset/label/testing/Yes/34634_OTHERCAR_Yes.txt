            I like this vechile because it has class.  A vechile says so much about  the person driving it.  It rides so smoothly, its like riding in a cadillac.  And I know cause I use to own a cadillac.  It is roomly.  Has plenty of leg room.  That is very important when you are taking trips.  Transporter is a vechile of commfort and  ease.  there is no stress when driving a transporter.  The seats are easy to remove and to put back in.  You can lay the seats down and haul bookcases if necessary.  If you wanted to leave the seats out for awhile you could help move or use them going to an auction.   I have never had a problem with this vechile. it is very dependable in every area.  The transporter is the best vechile to use when the roads are icey and snow on them.  it wll take you everywhere safely.  I love the fifteen inch tires.  Another feature is the air pump on it.  It will put air in your tires when you get  a flat out in the middle of nowhere. I like the windows because you can se all around you.  While you back up , pull up and the mirrors makes it easy to back up with.                                      <br><br>
