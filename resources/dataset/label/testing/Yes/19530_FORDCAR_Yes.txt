            Definately a great sports car. It has the looks and the GT has the power.  Realize that it is not quite the racing machine that it has been in the past.  It still will sit you back in your seat, but I wouldnt race anyone for pink slips unless you really modify the car.

We bought the car new and we now have almost 50,000 miles on the car and we haven't had any problems.  Change the oil every 5k miles and just did tran service and all that at the 50k mark.  So it is WAY more reliable than I expected.  

The problems that I noticed.  As a tall person, we had to nix the stick model.  Although the manual transmission is popular for sports cars, I would steer away from it on the mustang unless you have shorter legs.  At 6'1" I would have serious back problems from leaning forward to use the stick so I opted for the automatic.  The auto seems to shift fine (it's the first I've ever had, so that isn't speaking from experience) but it seems to eat gas.  I definately get below 20 miles per gallon (of course I tend to go 70  most of the time with a high percentage of freeway time).  Besides the stick location and the MPG, I have only one complaint, wind noise.  The good news is that it is from a defect that is fixable under warranty.  Both my windows were letting in way to much wind noise.  I had them both replaced, one stopped making the noise, one still does.  I will go back and have it replaced again when something else goes wrong (I bought an extended warranty).
