            My Mother bought this car because she wanted a nice luxury car, but didn't want to spend $50,000.  She was going to get a Toyota Camry, but the LEXUS name caught her greed.  She ended up paying about 2-3 thousand more for the Lexus Logo, leather seats, premium sound, and the full package.  At first, I had my doubts about this car.  I was like everyone else who felt this car was an expensive Camry.  In a sense, that statement is true.  However, there are many factors to put into play to characterize this vehicle.

I drive this car about 5-10 times a month, and it is a pleasure to do so.  The ES300 is no where close to it's Sisters LS400, GS Series, RX300, or the big LX450, but it carries it's own essense.  It's not as fast as the GS, as Classy as the LS, as Durable as the LX, nor as expensive as teh LX, but it is a beautiful car.

Toyota made this model just as smooth as the rest.  The ride that Lexus is known for (floating on a cloud) did not skip this model.  I can honestly proclaim that this car has a soothing ride.  It does look like a Camry, but it has a classy twist to it.  Besides the Lexus Intake Manifold, I have yet to see a stock Camry beat me in a race.  The Front Wheel Drive ES has surprising pickup, and it is comfortable enough to drive for Hours.  The Leather Seats are plush, and the 50 million positions that seat can move into to fit your comfort makes the world of difference.  I honestly can say that it is worth the extra bucks to get this car if you are in the market for a camry.

I recommend this car to anyone who wants a luxurious family car, or if they want a nice car that can smoke any Honda (except the S2000) right off the start.  To tell you the truth, I gained true respect for this car when it beat an Integra with Turbo, Exhaust, and ignition Kit by three car lengths from one light to the next (distance is est. at 3 blocks).  That was the best feeling in the world.  Those little teenagers shouldn't have all the fun.<br><br>
