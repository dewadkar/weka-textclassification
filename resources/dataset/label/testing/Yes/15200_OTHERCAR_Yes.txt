            I bought this Sienna van because of the quiet ride and the way I was treated at the dealer compared to the Honda Odyssey.  When I visited the Honda dealer the salespersons were stuck up, because they knew they had a hot selling van in a hot market. There were quite a few dealership that I visited where the salespeople would not come over to talk to the customer if they wanted to purchase or see the Odyssey.  I visited 1 Honda dealer and the salesman gave me his business card and told me to call him back to see if the Odyssey came in.  Here I am trying to spend my hard earning money to purchase a car and this is how they want to treat me.  I think that the salesman should call me instead of me calling him.  No way will I spend my money here.  Just wait till the market for the Honda van cools down and then he'll be pressured by his sales manager to sell more cars when business has slow down.  I have purchased 2 other Honda vehicles before.  I had owned a 87 and 93 Honda Accord.  Honda has gotten too big that they don't care about customer service anymore.  They do not value their customer anymore.  I wrote a letter to complain about their dealerships and what did they said, there was nothing that they can do because these dealership are independently owned.  Remember when Honda used to advertise their cars to be a practical car.  But their sales force is not practical anymore. Honda does not even have a website where you can write to them to express your opinion as compare to Toyota which has a website for owners to express their concern and for other owners of Toyota to be able to communicate to others. I would never ever buy a Honda again.  Honda has just lost a valuable customer for all I know.  Since I owned a Honda vehicle before, I know how a Honda rides.  The Honda van was very hard to test drive because of the availability of the car.  When I finally got a chance to test drive the Honda Odyssey, I was very disappointed with the way the van rode and drove.  It drove and rode like my 93 Honda Accord.  But when I sat in the Sienna there was no comparison to the Honda.  The Sienna was very smooth and quiet.  The salespeople at the Toyota dealers were very friendly.  I was treated like a king.  After a couple of days there was a follow up call from the salesman in which he told me on the day that I bought the Van that he would call and checkup on how I was doing in a couple of days.  From now on all of my vehicle purchase will be Toyota. <br><br>
