                 I am a mother of three boys and desperately needed a vehicle that offered a lot of room and comfort for long road trips.  We took our van on vacation the day after we bought it and we absolutely love it. We have the Dodge Caravan SE fully loaded with the remote keyless entry. With two adults and three growing boys we had more than enough room for us and all our luggage for a two week vacation in the mountains. 

     This vehicle has a lot of power for a v-6 even when going up a mountain. The only thing that bothers me about it is the lights on the dash for the wipers and a/c controls. Every time I start the van the lights flash for 10.5 miles then the computer resets (so I was told by the sales person).

     I love the way all the seats recline and the seat belts adjust comfortably for your height. My van has almost 55,000 miles and it rides very smoothly. When at a stop light I have to let off the brake just to be sure it's running, because the engine is so quiet and there is absolutely no vibration in this vehicle what so ever. Driving is a pleasure since I can see the road from every window, and it handles like a car.

     Anyone who needs room for hauling packages to children can appreciate this van. I bought mine used, two years old with almost 50,000 miles for $13,200. A great price for a large family vehicle.
