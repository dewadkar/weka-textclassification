            This is my second Sunfire. I loved my first one better, but I smacked it up. The cost of fixing air bags is a bear.

I bought my 1996 Sunfire in 1999 and I loved it. It was spacious (coming out of a Dodge Shadow) and stylish (coming out of a Dodge Shadow) and reliable (coming out of a 1986 Dodge Shadow) and hot (coming out of a Dodge Shadow). It had very high miles but was extremely reliable and I thought it was very cool. I had it for about a year and loved it so much that when I toasted it (my fault, and yes air bags are expensive to replace) I wanted another Sunfire.

I bought a 1999. It was 2000. I got a terrific deal, ($8,000 and very low miles). The dealer cautioned me against buying a colour I didn't like, but I bought it anyway. I hate it. It's green.

The tan interior with its mundane upholstery makes me feel like I'm wearing old slippers. I hate that.

The dash is taupe, or tan or some such nothing shade. I hate that.

It's not air conditioned. I hate that.

But the sucker has speed. Do I need that? Probably not given the price of speeding tickets, but I love it anyway. She has great pick up. I had to learn to drive stick to drive her, but I wouldn't drive anything but now. I've read a few reviews complaining about cheap door handles, et cetera, but they're fine with me. Nothing terribly cheap about them for an $8,000 price tag. I didn't buy a Mercedes for gawd's sake. You get what you pay for. No rattles, smooth transmission, excellent pick up, great gas mileage. Roomy seating. Everything handy. (I'm only 5'2" - what isn't roomy? A Dodge Shadow is not roomy.

I've had this car for three years. I've spent $39 every few months for an oil and lube. Nothing more. Nada. (Christmas, can I write this without cursing my luck?) The '96 was smooth on the wallet too.

My car looks good. I wish it was red. The 96 was. Shows what chicks want hmmmmm. I wish it had air conditioning. 

Those are my only complaints. Would I buy it again? No. I'd buy a red one.

I want basic, not ugly, transportation. My child doesn't like riding in the back seat because even for a 12-year-old it's a bit of a struggle to get out of a two-door Sunfire. She sometimes hits her head on the door on the way out. She's 5'6". I can't imagine being a regular sized adult trying to get out of the back seat.  However, I've packed a couple of bikes in the trunk with the seat pulled down. I've hauled lumber. It's a good size trunk - but the Dodge Shadow was better.

Would I buy it again? NO. I'd buy a red one. A red Sunfire, over and over again. Great mileage, solid car, sporty, great pick up.
