            We became the proud owners of our first &quot;bug&quot; this last October.  We chose the diesel (had to order it and wait 3 months to receive it) and the fuel mileage is terrific.  We get approximately 45 miles to the gallon average for both city and highway driving.  We are a tall family....6'4&quot; the tallest and 6' the shortest....and the leg and head room is incredible in the front seat.  The draw back is that the back seat is a bit cramped if all three of us are in it at the same time (rare).

There were a couple of things that surprised us and one is that it did not come with an ashtray.  We purchased that separately and it still is difficult to reach.  

The options we purchased with it are wonderful, such as the alloy wheels, and the sunroof (terriffic).

One pleasant sideline here is that we have noticed many other bug owners wave in passing.  It's almost like a shared pride in our cute little vehicles.<br><br>
