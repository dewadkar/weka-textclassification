            The new 2000 4-Door 4WD Silverado is a true pleasure to drive.  When this truck was updated in 1999 I was amazed at the new braking system (4 wheel anti-lock disc brakes), roomier, more powerful, more efficient, longer torque curve for towing, etc.  This truck re-affirmed Chevrolet's dominance of the truck market.  Now the 2000 is available with the extended cab fourth door.  It is really nice to be able to access the rear of the drivers cabin without having to walk around to the passengers side of the truck.  That advantage for me is great because I have two children, so it is nice to not have to lift one child seat over another.  Or worse yet, climb over the most comfortable seats you've ever sat in and get them dirty!

This truck is more than just the fourth door.  The interior room of the drivers cabin is extensive.  My personal choice was the front bucket seats.  However, you can get it equipped with a front bench seat (one more passenger if that important to you).  Foot room is very nice as well as head room. I'm 6'2&quot; so I notice these things.  The driver can easily access all vehicle information.  The drivers message center is concise but offers all pertinent information on the engine, transmission, temperature, and electrical components.  I really like the tow/haul mode which changes the computers shift mode for the transmission when hauling a heavy load.  What this does is reduce transmission wear from unnecessary shifting in and out of higher gears.  It also allows for a longer shifting from the lower gears to really pull the available torque from the engine.  The torque curve from the 5.3L V8 is longer than it predecessor the 5.7L 350 V8.  Plus it has more horsepower.  My experience has been that I get 2 to 3 MPG more on the motors.

The rear seating area is greatly improved from the previous design.  The seat is reclined at an 18 degree level.  This gives you a much greater back comfort especially on longer trips.  You don't feel as though you are setting back on a straight board.

Some of the little things that I like for example is that you can't lock your keys in the truck if the keys are still in the ignition.  You can lock your tailgate using your ignition key.  That is really nice if you ever equip your truck with a tonneau cover or a camper top.  Speaking of tonneau covers, you can order one from the factory now as an option!

This is really &quot;The Truck&quot; as Chevrolet has so branded it.  If you want a truck, this is the only one to have.  The bonus is that it holds it's re-sale value longer and at a greater value than it's competitors Ford and Dodge.  Yeah, it costs more than Ford or Dodge, but you get more back in the end.  And to use an old adadge from my grandfather, &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot;  This is the best truck by far!!<br><br>
