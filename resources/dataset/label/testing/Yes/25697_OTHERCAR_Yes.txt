            Hi, I'm Jean-Pascal Servant, and I want to talk to you about my car, a 1995 Nissan Pathfinder XE.

First of all, this car have a 3.0-liter SOHC V6 engine that give 153 horses. You can have it with manual 5-gear, or, like me, auto 4-gear.

Nissan, from the start, have always made excellent reliable car. Like my old Nissan Multi 1986 that was still running good when I sold it 500$ last year. You cannot compare that to a Dodge or Ford, Nissan is Japanese, that make the company more reliable by far away. For reliability, always Japanese.

The comfort is great on this car. For vacation, of anything else, the comfort of the front and rear seats are really good. The suspension is not hard, but I'm sure this will give problem in off-road experience. You can have, in option, a button for adjusting the suspension, to SPORT or COMFORT, that should solve the problem. 
With the comfort come the sound system. The sound system is designed with 8 speaker. It make a TERRIFIC sound!
The system is an outstanding fidelity, and gives deep, solid bass response. For car system (stock) I have never hear something better that this.
I don't like the rear-left seat that can't be pushed by the back because of the emergency tire that block the seat (for the Pathfinder who have their emergency tire in the cargo). This tire reduce the cargo limit, but it's the best place you can put it. You can put it outside, on the back door, that is really annoying, or below the car, that make the rim rust, like almost all cars, like the Nissan Multi 1986.

In off-road, I don't think this thing can be compared to a truck or a more smaller SUV. The Nissan PathFinder has been made for normal road, but on difficult road, I don't think it can make the job done as quick as certain competitor. Of course, this SUV have a 4WD system, that can be selected with a shifter placed next to the gear shifter. 2WD, 4WD, and 4WD LOW is the option. On snow, you NEED to put it on 4WD, because this car is rear-wheel drive, that make it difficult to drive. The Nissan company told us we can change 2WD to 4WD when riding lower that 60 km./h., about 40 miles an hour. At this speed, a major problem occurred, it's like the differential couldn't stick on the wheel. That give the wheel to hit the differential instead of connecting it. At each turn of wheel, it hit something, and that freak me.

I think it's the only problem we got with the car. Everything else work perfectly. AH, don't forget that there's no cup holder, and that Nissan have made a cup holder that can be placed in the cigarette holder tray.
But this thing put the radio control difficult to use.

If you buy this, I'm certain you won't be disappointed. This car has a great engine, excellent reliability, and the comfort of an SUV very superior. This car has been the best car I ever had. :)
