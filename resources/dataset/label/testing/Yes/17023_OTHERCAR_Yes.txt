            I liked it's style after viewing the first photo of the Dodge Durango. It was different than most of the box car type designs that are on the market. It sported a V-8 with great towing power. 
I live in the Rocky Mountains and spend many weeks each year towing a travel trailer at elevations between 4500 feet and 7500 feet elevation in and around Yellowstone National Park. The Dodge Durango performs as advertised. I can honestly say that there are times that I don't know the trailer is behind me and on days when I'm not towing the Durango delivers almost twenty miles per gallon. It's quiet ride makes it a pleasure to drive. The optional third seat allows at least six adults to travel in comfort.
I would highly recommend this vehicle to friends and family.<br><br>
