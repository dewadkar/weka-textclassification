            I bought this car in Feb 2000 used, with 15,000 miles on it.  I needed a good reliable car for commuting, with excellent gas mileage.  I did my homework, and finally decided on the Neon. I ended up getting the Plymouth Neon, but it's identical to the Dodge Neon.  I went for the 2 door since it's just me and my wife, and I liked the look of the 2 door, as well as the ability to open them up and be able to put large objects in the car (I've moved a desk and a 6 foot high cat tree to day... takes some work, but it'll fit!)

I haven't had a problem so far, 2 years later and 30,000 miles.  I regularly chain the oil, I had the brakes done once, and the tires replaced, but otherwise nothing.  No mechanical problems what so ever.  I've been really impressed.  And the car drives as well now as it did back at 15,000 miles.  

I've read on a few Dodge Neon enthusiast sites that the car can start having problems around 60K, but alot of that has to do with how you drive it and care for it.  I've also talked to people with over 100K on their car with no problems, so take that for what it is worth.

Right off the gas mileage is awesome.  Since I live in Los Angeles and commute about 60 miles round trip each day, I wanted something easy on gas.  This car has been excellent.  Whenever I talk to others about gas mileage I always seem to get the best.  The flip side of course is that the car is only a 4 cylinder, and doesn't accelerate as quick as I would like, but it's a trade off worth having.  

The interior is great.  The back is a little less spacious, but again this doesn't affect me.  The front is great, all controls are easy to use and clealy marked.  The drink holders dont really work for larger beverages, but anything like a Starbucks Venti or smaller is fine.  

The back seats fold down, giving you access to the trunk from inside.  

There's not much more I can say.  I could go into every detail, but your best bet is to go test ride one yourself!! Why cheat yourself when you can treat yourself!!!  For the price, it's definately an amazing car, and I would buy another Neon once mine gets high in miles.
