            The new Tundras are unbelievable, I'm an experienced off-roader and this is by far the best truck for it. Its more powerful than any other truck, its more faster, its more durable, more fuel efficient and less weighted than other trucks of its class. With all of that in mind it makes it the &quot;King of the Dirt&quot;. I have always been very impressed with Toyota's truck, I've just been waiting for them to create something much bigger than what they've had in the past, and now it is here. Maintaining a Toyota is simple. It will generally cost more to fix a Tundra than a Chevy, but you won't have to fix nearly as much as you would the Chevy.
I recommend the Tundra to anyone who can afford it.<br><br>
