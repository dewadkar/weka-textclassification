            I bought this car 1994 and have had minimal issues with it.  Here are a few that I have had Fuel Pump in September 1999 for $325.00, the alternator in October 1999 for $194.00, and it also had an oil leak in May 1999, I had the dealer look at it, but they said I had to steam clean it so they could see what was going on.  I steam cleaned it and took it to my mechanic and he fixed the leaky seal for $90.00.  

I am not easy on a car, I like to drive quickly and it keeps up with me... it only has a 3.1 liter engine, but it feels bigger.  It gets about 20 to 25 miles per gallon.

I drive approximately 28 miles to work (one way) and 80 percent of it is interstate... it does very well.  I have 120,000 miles and the only time my car has left me on the side of the road was with the Alternator and Fuel Pump issues... otherwise it has been very reliable... of far... to be continued...<br><br>
