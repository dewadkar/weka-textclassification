            I wanted a new 350Z so bad, I've had pictures up in my house for months (I had a '93 300zx and loved it). But my wife pointed out (many times) that a baby seat wouldn't make it in the 2-seater 350Z. So I got the g35 coupe (w/ performance package), and I love it. Baby seat fits just fine.

This is a fast car...off the line it is quick (not crazy fast, but definitely fast enough), and on the highway, I feel like I am invincible. Passing in sixth gear is a pleasure. This car loves doing 80.

Handling and especially the brakes are superb, the car is glued to the pavement and the brakes are just beautiful. I never thought I could love brakes so much.

Engine and exhaust sounds are perfect, a little aggressive growl that I could listen to all day.

For $38k (no discounts and no sympathy from the dealers down here in Miami), I was a little disappointed with the interior, but it is growing on me. When you compare the interior to the BMW 330ci, forget it (the BMW interior is beautiful). But like I said, it is growing on me.

In general, I love this car. A speeding ticket is inevitable.
