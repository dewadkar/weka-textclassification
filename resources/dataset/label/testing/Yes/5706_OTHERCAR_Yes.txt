            I bought this vehicle due to the fact that I had leased a '96 Sentra and put an excessive amount of mileage on it, so I did not want to get killed in charges upon return.  

The great thing about this car is it is consistent, it picks up when you want it to and gives you the acceleration you need (it's no Mustang GT or anything).  

One thing I can say I hate about it is after only about 20,000 miles it started to have a little squeek in the windows.  When you would get up to high speeds the windows will have problems with air making them shake and squeak.  I sometimes get the feeling they did not tighten all the nuts and bolts completely.  

However, that is the least of my concerns.  I do alot of driving ~50,000 miles in the two years I have had the car and have had minimal problems.  The only major one was that the evaporator on the A/C unit went bad.  In Atlanta summers this is something you might expect though.  

This car is a meat and potatoes kind vehicle.  It has an interesting look to it, but it is not fancy, it gets you where you have to go and back and does it well, another reason I bought it.  Also most people I know have had good experiences with Nissan, and claim they run forever (~200,000).  You should buy this vehicle if you want good reliable transportation, not if you want something to define you as an individual.<br><br>
