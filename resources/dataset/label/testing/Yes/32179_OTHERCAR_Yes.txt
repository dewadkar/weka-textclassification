            When I wrecked my truck in October, I decided it was time to buy a new car.  The maintenance and repair bills were taking a big bite out of my budget.  I researched online and off but when the research became hands-on, the Chevrolet Cavalier was the hands-down winner.  

At 5'2', it isn't always easy to find a car that fits but the Cavalier does and yet, there's room enough for my 6' dad and brother to ride or drive.  

As a woman, I did have an unpleasant experience with one dealer. In my online research I found that as a credit union member, I could skip all the haggling by going straight to the fleet managers.  Within 48 hours, I had bids from two dealers and one dealer had my deposit.

I like the fact that for the first 36,000 miles (or 3 years), I don't have to worry about getting stranded by a flat tire or car trouble- Chevrolet will come riding to my rescue for free.  After that, I only pay for the services.  As a special plus, if I keep the dealer's display license plate on the front of my car and the decal on the back, my dealer will change my oil every 4,000 miles free of charge.

Pssst! My car and insurance payments fit nicely in the hole in my budget that was once reserved for repairs!!!
