            The 1999 Chrysler 300M has been a great car for me.  This has been one of my family's main cars since the summer of 1999, when we bought it, then took a road trip all the way from Portland, OR to San Diego, CA!  It runs great and looks great, too!  We have a 300M that has white as the exterior color, with a tan interior theme.  It also has the optional "sport package."  The sport package has better wheels than the standard, better tires, and a better engine.  I paid $28,500 (with a Freightliner Discount).

<b>Interior</b>

The dash board on this beautiful automobile has an elegant "Swiss Watch" look.  All of the gauges, spedometer, RMP, and clock all have the same theme.  What makes a gauge have a "Swiss Watch" look are the hands and numbers.  The hand is fat in the center, ending in a narrow point, making it very stylish.  The numbers, or, in the clock's case, lines, are set in an elegant typestyle.
All of the interior knobs are easily identifiable with numbers or text saying what each one does.  They, too, have a stylish design.  The seats are 4-way adjustable using two different knobs that form the shape of the seat.  How handy and user friendly!
On the dash board, above the radio and the climate control system is a simulated wood panel.  It looks stunningly real!  It extends from the very left of the interior to the very right.  There are also simulated wood panels under the interior door handles and on the side of the doors (interior) that extend for about 9 inches.  There are also seat heaters for both front seats, with Hi and Lo options.

The seats are pure leather, and high quality leather it is!  It has lasted my family the two years we have had the car, while showing no age whatsoever.  Very high quality American product.

<b>Exterior & Performance</b>

The exterior features beautiful shiny paint and beautiful wheels.  The body of the car has a very stylish design, too.  With a round front and a quick to end back, this car is designed to be very sporty!
I have taken this car up to 110 MPH on the highway, and it rides so smooth.  I didn't even realize I was going so fast!  This car delivers a smooth ride every day, and a powerful ride, too, as Chryslers are known for their powerful engines.  It gets fairly good gas mileage for a car with its power and size (18/26).
The first time I looked in the trunk, I was amazed at how large it is!  It can fit about four full sets of golf clubs in carry bags, and still have much room to put other stuff on top!  Very huge.
<b>Conclusion</b>

This car has been a great addition to my car collection.  It is a very powerful automobile.  It's nice to finally see a great American car that combines luxury and performance in one stylish package.
