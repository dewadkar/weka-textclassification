            This is my 5th new Saab and I must say it is the most comfortable and sophisticated Saab I have owned.  The drive is comfortable but not too isolated from what is going on.  The SE V6t engine does produce a notable engine noise when you press firmly on the accelerator from a standstill.  However that is probably a good thing since it reminds me that I am wasting a limited resource driving that way.  On the highway the impressive torque provides quiet and smooth performance in the 55 to 85 range.  I haven't taken it up to its limits because honestly that is truly foolish and un-safe on U.S. roads.  As an FYI - - check your tire pressure - - I find the most practical pressure to be between 33 to 36 psi.

The car was delivered with zero defects.  I carefully inspect a car when I take delivery and there were no paint, body, interior or other defects.

The interior fit and finish is as good as what I have experienced in Audi's and Mercedes.  As typically with all Saabs the seats are very comfortable both for short trips and on long trips.  I find myself free of that 'fidgity' feel even after several hours planted in the seat.

The creature comforts such as ACC, sound and trip computer functions work as expected.  The cars cools down quickly on 90+ degree days and the ACC is truly set and forget it.

The inclusion of leather insert on the door panels for the 2000 model year is a welcomed addition when compared to my sisters 99 9-5 SE.  The ashtray has been replace by a dash bin (don't worry smokers can still have an ashtray installed).

My only wish is that SAAB still produced the paint Citrine Beige.  This was the first time I had to break my tradition of a citrine beige Saab.

Remember to read your owners book.  There are features and programmable options that make the car even more customized to your needs.  A residual heating system on the V6 keeps the car warm for you when you run into the store etc.  Also you can program the car to automatically re-circulate the cabin air when you are in slow moving traffic etc.  

Saab has produced a sophisticated, pleasurable and comfortable car while maintaining harmony with good performance, outstanding safety and a visually unique package.<br><br>
