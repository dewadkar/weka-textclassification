            The Honda Accord is a wonderful car.  Before I purchased this car I searched the net for as much info as I could.  This car was rated so high on all scales that I could not think of why I shouldn't purchase this vehicle.  I purchased the four door LX model and it still looks sporty with the extra doors.  If your a person who like to take off at a light, this car is the one for you(it has great pickup).  There is a fresh air button that lets the air from outside come in, so you don't have to use the ac all the time.  It has a one touch power window button(all you do is touch the button and it lets the driver side window down all the way without having to hold it.  The gas tank locks so you have to pull the lever on the side of the driver side seat.  The seat belts are also adjustable according to height.  The stock radio has a nice sound to it with many options.  The ride is very smooth and there is barely any cab noise.  The good thing is that all you have to do is make sure you have your regular oil changes and the only major maintenance is not until 90,000 miles(change the timing belt).
  The only downside that I have come across is that it takes about $20.00 to fill the tank(NJ prices).
 Overall this is a great car either for the young(I'm 22), family(very roomy), or old(very easy access).  I would recommend this car to anyone.  <br><br>
