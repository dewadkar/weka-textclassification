            I cannot say enough about the quality of the Lexus ES 300. In October 1995, I purchased my first luxury vehicle...the Lexus ES 300. What a dream of an automobile! I loved every minute of every mile.

In February 1996, I was traveling on an Interstate highway on an icy early evening. I hit an icy patch on the road and lost all control of my vehicle. My Lexus went into a circular rotation several times before slamming head on into a concrete barrier. WOW! I just knew that I was going to die, but...because of the quality built vehicle, I can still write and tell the world that I am alive and well.

The car? The entire front end of the car was demolished. I only had 2,000 miles on the car, but luckily my insurance company took care of my repair bills. ALSO, the LEXUS dealership was a charm! After my insurance rental reimbursement maxed out, the dealership paid for the remainder of my rental agreement until the vehicle was repaired!

Today and over 50,000 miles later, I am still driving the Lexus. WHAT A TERRIFIC AUTOMOBILE!<br><br>
