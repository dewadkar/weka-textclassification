            You know, when I went shopping for a digital camera, I was astounded at the number of choices on the market.  Makers I never heard of before were getting some pretty good reviews on this site and elsewhere.  After a little research I knew I wanted a camera with a USB connection, one that was light enough and solid enough to carry around without a case, and my new camera definitely had to have a macro mode since I was going to be doing some close-up photography.  I found all of these features in many cameras in many price ranges, but the one that fit my budget and had all the features I wanted was the PowerShot S-10.  And what a camera.  I'm very pleased.

First of all, I'm not a professional photographer, nor did I want to become one.  I didn't have the time or inclination to learn about lighting, depth of field, or white balance.  I just wanted to take some pretty pictures for my eBay auctions.  So it was important to buy a camera that was easy to use out of the box.  I was unsure about this with the S-10, but it fit my template so well in every other area that I thought I'd chance it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Right away, within the first 8 megs of shots, I was taking very good pictures with very little knowledge.  
As I began to play with the S-10 more, I became aware of its flexibility.  If you're into manually controlling the settings on your camera, the S-10 won't disappoint you.  It gives you control over most any aspect of the shot that you could think of (if you're an amateur like me).  I've found that in some cases, like when lighting conditions are darker, manually tweaking some of the settings produces a better quality image than what you would get with the automatic mode.  So playing a little can produce some excellent results.

The controls and buttons on the camera are logically thought out and well placed.  The camera feels good in your hands because of its weight and brushed metal exterior case.  The back of the camera is the location for the smallish LCD screen, which performs very well, even in bright daylight.  Five dual-function buttons and two multi-function toggle switches also sit on the back panel.  The top of the camera hosts a wheel that, when rotated to a particular position, turns the camera on in whatever mode you need: auto, manual, image mode (where default settings for varying conditions like nighttime or panoramic are loaded), and stitch assist mode.  Playback mode and PC link mode are also controlled by this wheel.  The shutter release button feels realistic, and requires just the right amount of finger pressure to depress it.  The viewfinder is located above the LCD screen.

You can read other reviews to get into the technical aspects of image quality, functionality, and specs.  I'm just here to tell you that this little camera has the goods to perform very well.  There are a couple drawbacks, however.  The S-10 feels nice and heavy in your hands, yet it lacks a very defined grip and sometimes you feel as if you're might drop it.  The metal case is great, but is a bit slippery.  Some rubber in key places would help a lot.  Another gripe: there's no easy way to preview a shot you've just taken on the LCD screen.  I've read that there is a way to do this, but it's not something that's very important to me, so I haven't bothered.  Also, as with all cameras with LCD screens, battery life is pretty dismal.  I only get around 60 images shot before I've got to charge the battery again.  

The contents of the box included the camera, a battery with charger, a USB cable and serial cable, camera software, and a couple printed manuals. 

I've seen these cameras advertised for $380-$550 on various electronics sites.  I found mine on eBay for $360, and it was new in a factory sealed box.  Look on an auction site to find a really good deal.  

Try an S-10.  You'll dig it.
