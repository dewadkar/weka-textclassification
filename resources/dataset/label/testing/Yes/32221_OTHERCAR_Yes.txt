                 I recently purchased a '93 Vigor GS and it has brought me nothing but fun.  It is truly a driver's car.  I bought this car because of the attractive styling, Honda reliability, and uniqueness.  

     The Vigor is truly one of a kind.  It has a 5-cylinder engine that is mounted like a rear wheel drive car as opposed to the traditional laterally mounted engine of a front wheel drive car.  I love this car because of it's great stereo system (8 speakers), impressive handling, and powerful acceleration.  After 134,314 miles, the engine still runs like a clock at idle, and drives like it is right off the assembly line with no squeaks or rattles.  When I bought this car, it had an oil leak near the distributor, which is common in Vigors.  Other than that and a rip in the driver's seat, it's perfect.  

     From the minute you sit down in its luxurious, full leather interior, you can tell you're in for a comfortable yet fun ride.  When your foot hits the gas, the 5-cylinder power plant comes to life, giving off heavenly sounds.  It's quiet at cruise, yet you can hear the engine during acceleration.  The 4,245 lb chassis is balanced perfectly and it handles like a dream.  In my opinion, the perfect combination for a sport-sedan.  

     Anyone who loves to drive, yet wants a practical, fuel efficient automobile should consider the Acura Vigor.  If you are lucky enough to own this rare car, hang onto it.  Acura knew what they were doing with the Vigor, too bad they only produced it for 3 years.  <br><br>
