            PLEASE RATE MY REVIEW AND SEND FEEDBACK



The review I just read from Eclipse 780 is untrue.  Saturn does not offer a 3000 mile satisfaction trial period, and the two month period is not true either.  I know this because I have been working for Saturn for over two years and the only things I can say about this company are good.   No other car company offers ANY sort of moneyback guarantee, and if our friend Eclipse780 would have bought a car anywhere else, he/she would still be stuck in it.  

Saturn does however offer a full 30 day/1500 mile moneyback guarantee on all their new cars.  Also, all Saturn Service Plans covers paying for rental cars if your car has to be kept overnight.  

The other thing said about the insurance pricing is simply a matter of different factors that are weighed in when getting insurance on a new car.  Factors such as driving history, safety equipment, what region of the country you live in, and coverages all can make insurance prices vary.  Have you ever really shopped insurance?  Three different companies come up with three completly different amounts they want you to pay every six months.  Also, the two cars being compared are not the same.  The Alero, two and four doors, are considered sedans.  The SC2 is considered a sports coupe.  There's a difference.  You have to compare apples to apples on these things.  And if you did, you would see that Saturns have the lowest insurance costs, in their class.  A comparable car to price insurance against the SC2 would be a Ford Mustang, or a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  I guarantee they will be higher.

But the thing that bothers me the most about the review in question is the fact that even after everything Saturn has done to make things right with Eclipse780, he/she still holds a grudge.  The moneyback guarantee was up; they refunded him/her anyway.  He had to pay for a rental car; they refunded him/her again.  It sounds to me like Eclipse just got a 100% free car for two months, and then badmouths it.  

Saturns are great cars, I am an employee, and an owner.  But the best part of owning a Saturn comes after you buy it.  When you become more than just a name in a salesman's sales log, and you become part of something much larger.  A PART OF THE FAMILY.  Saturn does everything they can, and more, to make sure that each and every person who is out there on the road in a Saturn 150% completely-over satisfied.  If you don't believe me, try one yourself.  The worst thing that can happen is that you give it back after you decide you don't like it.<br><br>
