            For many years people have been telling me to get a Volvo, get a Volvo... so finally I gave in. About 4 months ago I bought my first Volvo. I searched and searched, and finally found one in southern Mass. It was a 1991 240 DL sedan. I instantly fell in love with it, and when i took it to the mechanic whom I have known for many years he told me to buy it as soon as I could......
Well I ended up buying it and so far it has been the best car I have ever owned. (knock on wood) I have had no problems with it. The a/c works great and the heat, once it gets going, works fine.
The car has 137K miles and I have had no problem with it. It is very roomy which is amazing because it is a four door sedan. I am 6'2 and have always driven an SUV because I could never get any room for my legs. This car has plenty.
While a Volvo may not be the sportiest car on the road, it is one of the safest most reliable cars anyone can get. All ages should buy one, and lets hope since Ford bought them out they don't ruin Volvo's great reputation.
