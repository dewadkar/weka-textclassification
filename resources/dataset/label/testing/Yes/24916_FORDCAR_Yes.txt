            My first car in life was a BMW 320i.  It was already eleven years old when I bought it, so needless to say, it was not the best car I ever owned.  Then again, whose first car is?  After that, I owned a 1992 Ford Explorer.  I was very pleased with the Ford brand and with the dealerships that I took the car to.  When I decided it was time for a new car, I knew that I wanted another Ford, but couldn't decide between another Explorer or a Mustang.  I finally settled on the Mustang because I had been eyeing a sports car for years.  I test drove the convertible LX model as well as the hard top LX and wound up buying the hard top, automatic LX with leather interior.  I highly recommend upgrading to the leather seats with this car.  I don't like cloth interiors in general, but the Ford cloth interiors are especially ugly.  

I have a 1999 model, the first of the newest body style.  It's also the 35th anniversary and has a cool &quot;corral&quot; around the Mustang emblem on the side.  They have upgraded the HP from 150 to 190 and this car needs them all.  It's an exceptionally heavy car.  I don't know the exact specifications, but I can tell you that it feels like it weighs several tons when you are behind the wheel.  That's another thing that I like about it.  A lot of sports cars don't feel like they weigh enough to keep you from getting airborne in a windstorm.  The Mustang doesn't have this problem.

I can't talk intelligently about 0-60 times or acceleration or anything like that, so I won't.  What I will say is that this car was designed to be a straight shift and the automatic suffers from that.  The transmission is somewhat erratic.  I plan to get a GT for my next vehicle and I will definitely be making it a straight shift.<br><br>
