            you dont wanna wreck this one. Not only is the car itself costly, repairs are outragous. The new 5-series in extremely roomy and comfortable, even in the back. Has 6 standard airbags, Duel airbags, side airbags (only in front), and eye level side airbags. 4-wheel ABS are standard as well on both models in the 5-series. The engines differ in each model as following: A 2.8 liter, in-line six engine is equiped on the 528, and a 4.4 liter V-8 engine with six speed transmission is on the 540. A sports package is available which gives you 17-inch tires and a stiffer suspension. If you have go the money and/or are looking for speed, i reccomend you go with, or check into the 540 BMW.<br><br>
