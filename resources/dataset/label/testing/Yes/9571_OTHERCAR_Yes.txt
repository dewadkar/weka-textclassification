            The toyota Celica is a really nice car compared with the price you have to pay. It has a small/compact size and it has some pretty nice features like leather, sunroof, power everything and lately Toyota has come out with a crewzer model. It extends the rear passenger area and it now has a trailer hitch and trailer that looks just like the rear end of the Celica. I was not able to get this car for my first car because my parents claimed that insurance would be too high, and the car was too small, so instead they baught me a sport Utility Vehicle. For6 weeks straight I went to the Toyota car lot just to sit in the Celica and wish that I could get one, the new car smell of the Celica is unlike anyother car Ive Ever been in. I recommend this car to mostly teenagers guys and girls, andi recommend it to slightly older people who are wishing to be a little bit sportier. <br><br>
