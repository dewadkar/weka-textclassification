            I just leased my brand new 2004 Nissan Quest minivan. I am happy because I have the room I need for 3 kids plus a baby on the way. I have room for backpacks, groceries, library books, tons of stuff to take to goodwill. No matter how much stuff I pack in, everything comes out nicely and there is still plenty of comfortable space for everyone.
I love the sleek style and great gas mileage. I think its amazing how you drive down the road and you see people smiling at your car since they are impressed at the cool style. Its not like any other minivan on the road. I have to agree with another Epinion writer that I do have people stopping me as well to ask all about the van.
I went to a kids birthday party and pulled up to get my daughter. This woman ran over to see it. She said to her hubby look honey this is it!! I want this van. She made me open every door with the keyless remote and flip down the DVD player (for the kids of course) and she was on cloud nine. 
The van is smooth. The ride is awesome. I must say that the Nissan dealer is WONDERFUL out in WESTON, FL. If you have any questions or problem they are on it in seconds. That means everything to me. Good Luck.
PS. I would like to add that all doors can be opened by the touch of a button including the back of the van. They all have safety features in the event of little fingers. I was very impressed with the side curtain airbags which go all the way back on both sides. The front air bag turns off automatically if a child weighing a certain amount occupies it. THAT comes in handy! This van comes with all the safety perks.
Added information to help make your decision:
--Under the hood lies a 3.5-liter V6 engine producing 240 horsepower &#151 that's 70 hp more than the previous Quest.
--19 mpg city/26 mpg highway with the four-speed and 18 city/25 highway with the five-speed.
-- With plenty of storage room there is a triangular bin located on the dash board directly in front of the driver. A slotted device on the steering column is perfect for parking lot tickets or directions.
--Four-wheel antilock brakes, full-length side curtain airbags, brake assist, electronic brake force distribution and traction control are standard on all Quests.
--This van provides a smooth quiet ride no matter where your seating position happens to be.
I hope this helps!
