            I received the HPC315 for Christmas this year and have found myself taking photos just about every day since. Once I got my wife to tell me how much she spent on it ($299), I decided to compare it to other cameras with similar functions and found that the other cameras cost much more than this one did. I think this camera is well worth the price. I found it very easy to operate and download to my pc using the usb cable which comes with it. I do wish it would have came with a power cord, but I cant complain considering everything this camera has to offer and the price which it is going for. I am not going to tell you everything it has and does because reading the other reviews, I believe that has already been covered. If you are considering buying a HPC315, I would recommend it. I took a picture of a printer I am selling on Ebay with this camera on its lowest setting (640X480)and I feel it came out just fine. I guess it all comes down to how picky you are. The photo I am talking about can be found at http://www.angelfire.com/geek/abel/Im000047.jpg    . This photo was taken in poor lighting only using the flash on the camera.<br><br>
