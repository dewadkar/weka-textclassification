            In June we purchased a 1999.5 Nissan Pathfinder SE Ltd.4x4, in Sierra Silver, and Slate Cloth interior. We chose the 
following options: Popular Pkg.(which includes the Bose Audio system, fog lights, power antenna, and dual illum.
visor mirrors), Auto Transmission, Limited Slip Differential, Sunroof Pkg.(which includes power tilt &amp; slide sunroof,
overhead console w/ compass and digital exterior temperature, and Home Link System). The Home Link System is
really nice, it allows you to program things like the garage door opener, security system codes, house lights, all
at a push a button on the Home Link Pad, on the driver side visor. We have added a few accessories, like towing
reciever hitch, hood deflector, and sunroof wind deflector. The vehicle is awesome looking, with all the Titanium
colored accents, great wheels and beefy tires, Honey Comb Grill (SE Ltd. only), and the tubular running boards.
  We drove just about every SUV on the market, before we decided on the Pathfinder. It simply had everything
we were looking for, and the best price of them all. We nearly bought the 4Runner Ltd, but could not come to a
good enough deal. We actually got a better equipped SUV, that is 5.5&quot; wider than the 4Runner, and we saved 
almost $6000 buying the Pathfinder. We have 6000 miles on it now and I can honestly say we love our Pathfinder!
We had a little bit of unceartainty about the amount of power (172 hp) but that was quickly set aside after a big
camping trip this past August. We towed a 5'x8' Utility trailer, loaded to the hilt, as well as a fully loaded vehicle
and roof rack. We probably had 3000-3500# of gear and trailer, and it handled it with ease. We had several steep
inclines,(6% grade) for several miles, and we never got under 55mph. The vehicle is really great for towing with 
it's peak torque @ 2800 rpm's. 
  The Bose stereo system is simply unmatched. It is powerful, crystal clear, and the bass response is great. The 
closest other system in another vehicle, is the Nachamichi sound system in the Lexus RX 300, and it costs about 
$1600, as an option. I really do not have one bad thing to say about the Pathfinder, take one for a test drive and
prove it to yourself. And if more convincing, go to http://edmunds.com, go to the Town Hall section, Topic # 1504
and read the comments of other Pathfinder owners.

I have an update, with the new 2001 Pathfinder comes the addition of much
more power, 70 hp and 60 ft lbs of torque. All this is standard on any of
the 2001 Patfinders. I drove one and it is just fabulous! That simply put,
makes this the best, even better. They also added a 6 CD in-dash changer
standard on the SE &amp; LE Models. The only down side to all that power is,
that the vehicle uses Premium fuel, OH Well, a small price to pay for the
best SUV on the market!!<br><br>
