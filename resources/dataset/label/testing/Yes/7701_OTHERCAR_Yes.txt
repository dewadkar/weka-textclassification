            The Chevy Tahoe is a beautiful and practical vehicle.  I bought the LT model which comes with the things that you would expect in a luxury SUV.  It has leather seating with power as well as heated driver and passenger seating.  Another great feature is automatic dimming mirrors, which reduces the need for constantly re-adjusting mirrors for glare.

The Tahoe is a large SUV but easy to manage.  It is a few inches shorter than the Suburban so if your needs don't include transporting a hockey team, it is a lot easier to parallel park.  The 1999 and newer models feature next generation airbags which are less likely to injure the occupants of the front seats.  This vehicle has automatic 4-wheel drive available, which sends power to all the wheels when it senses a loss of traction.  This is a great thing for winter driving.  You can,of course, use the other drive train options, such as 4-HI or 4 LO.  The Tahoe allows the driver to control the mode with just a push of the button.

This vehicle is very sturdy, capable of off-road driving but so comfortable that you won't mind driving for hours in the city.  I love the Tahoe but there are a couple of small items that could be added to make it the perfect SUV (it's already close).  A memory driver's seat would be a nice touch, along with the option of a moon-roof.  

The bottom line is that the Tahoe is a safe, comfortable vehicle that is fun to drive and practical.  It's low key good looks are appealing without being pretentious.  I love it and would buy another.<br><br>
