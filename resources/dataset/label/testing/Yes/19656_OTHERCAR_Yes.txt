            My husband and I bought our 99 Saturn SL1 in July of 1998 and have really enjoyed it! We bought it after doing lots of research and found that it was highly regarded among it's size class. Our salesperson, Donna, was very helpful and stayed late with us to work out all of the details. She even went over to service department and helped pick out some sturdy boxes for our upcoming move! Very soon after we purchased it, we drove it from Lubbock, TX to  Macon, GA for a new job that my husband had accepted. The Saturn got really good gas mileage on the highway and didn't give us any trouble during the trip. 

I never mind taking the Saturn in to be serviced as I am treated with respect at all times. As a woman, I have had bad experiences in the past with mechanics and always dreaded taking my previous cars in for service. At Saturn, they offer me a free soft drink and a nice place to sit while they service the car. They even wash it for me before they return it to me! Earlier this month ( December) they gave us tickets to a Christmas event at a local museum. 

We have already decided that our next car will be a Saturn. We have also convinced several friends and family members to seriously consider buying a Saturn for their next car.<br><br>
