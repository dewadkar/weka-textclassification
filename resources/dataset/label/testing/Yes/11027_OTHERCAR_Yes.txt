            This van is very reliable.  We had a 1989 Astro which we kept for 10 years before deciding we wanted a new one.  The biggest thing it was in the shop for, was the brakes and that was just typical wear and tear.  We have since bought a 2000 Astro.  Chevy doesn't seem to have changed much.  It still has a hard time going up hills.  Slow off the starting line, but that's to be expected, it's a minivan, not a Ferrari. The biggest problem I have with this model is the passenger seats.  They're difficult to slide back.  You have to be directly in the middle of the seat when sliding it back, otherwise only one side will slide and it will be all crooked. And are they ever heavy!

Another thing I didn't like about the '89 and which is still a problem with the 2000 is the rattle from the sliding door.  I live in Northern Ontario and our roads are little more than logging trails.  Whenever we ride over the slightest bump, the door sounds like it's going to fall right off.

Plus, this van is not the most economical re: gas mileage.  It's heavy by minivan standards, probably because it's built on a truck frame.  (It's actually listed under trucks on the GM website.)

The main reason we like this van is because the driver and passengers are so high up.  It's like driving a truck and everyone gets a better view.

Northern Ontario residents take heed.  We have yet to find car mats that will keep the melted snow and salt from trickling into the base of the seat.  All that salt cannot be good for the bolts attaching the seat to the floor of the van.  All that slush just trickles down there because of the slant where the pedals are and sits there a while if you don't take the time to sop it up.

All in all, if you're looking for something that will last and take your families on trip after trip, this is the one.  If GM would take care of a few minor details, this van would be close to perfection.
