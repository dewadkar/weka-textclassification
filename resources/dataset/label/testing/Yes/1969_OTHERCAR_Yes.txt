            The Nissan Maxima SE has long been one of my favorite, reasonably priced sedans. This sedan continues in that tradition.  This is mainly because of its smooth 222-hp V6 and available five-speed manual.  And it is a fact that it's the best Maxima powertrain yet.  The Maxima also provides more interior room, especially in the backseats, than the Accord and Camry for not much more money.  The lowest base price is around $21,049.

The styling may be a bit um...ugly...and the steering doesn't seem to have found the feel of the previous Maxima SE.  But still, the Maxima has found a place in my heart.
