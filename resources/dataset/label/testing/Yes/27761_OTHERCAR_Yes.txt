            First of all, there are only 2 bad things I can possibly say about this camera, so let me get them out of the way, and then move on to all the good things.  First, it doesn't capture video, and second it doesn't capture sound.  Those are nice extra features, but if they are important to you, then this isn't the camera for you.

The images generally come through very clear and sharp as long as there is reasonable lighting.  I tried to take a picture of the moon, and all I got was a blurry sphere. Perhaps with a tripod, it would have looked semi decent.  I also tried taking a picture directly into the sun at the beach. I ended up with a lovely sillioute of the beach with people on the horizon, and a reasonably blue sky.  These of course are the two most drastic conditions I can imagine to take a photograph of, and both turned out better than I had anticipated.

The camera comes with an 8 meg Compactflash card, which hold about 15 pictures at middle high quality.  It's pretty useless, so I would recomend immediatly buying a 64 meg card (just over 100 pictures at middle high quality).  

The selling factor for me was the USB connection and the Lithium Ion Battery.  It is difficult to find a camera with all the features you want, and so I had to compromise on a few things.  For instance, the camera only has 2x optical zoom.  I have a palm pilot cradle connected to my serial port, so a camera with a serial connection was not even an option (and I didnt want to buy an extra card reader yet).  

The camera is almost exactly the size of a pack of cigarettes, and so I carry it at all times in my pocket with my Palm V.  It lets you take shots that you normally would miss unless u always lug your 35mm camera around with you. 

The camera feels solid in your hands, it has all metal casing, and so its not going to get crushed in your pocket, purse, or backpack.  The lense opens/closes and extends/retracts automatically when you turn it on and off.  (unlike the Olympus one which I was also considering which you have to bang the cover against the lense everytime you close it).

As with all Digital Cam's the LCD screen is what eats up batteries the fastest, but with a li. ion battery, its only a matter of minutes before you are back up to capacity.  I kind of wish they had a car adaptor charger so that you don't need to be near a wall socket when the battery icon starts flashing.  The battery is so small that no other company makes one to fit the camera, but you can find a spare one on ebay for about $40.  

They also make fun accesories for it, like an underwater case.  By the way, it comes with an adapter to plug it in directly to an RCA Video In jack in your TV.  It will display whatever would normally appear on the LCD screen on the TV.  Normally this is used to view the stored images, but you can instead use the TV as a viewfinder, or you could use it as a video camera in conjunction with your VCR.  (fun stuff for geeks like me)
