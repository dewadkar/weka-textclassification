            Back in September, I had the opportunity to test drive this new 2001 Mazda Tribute 4WD all the way to Santa Barbara and Carpinteria, CA.  My wife, my kids, and I used it for a whole week-end.  We departed from Modesto, CA and headed to Pismo Beach.  Our final destination was Carpinteria because we found the best hotel reservations there.  It was a great ride.  Everywhere we turned, onlookers could not stop looking at the shining metals covering the Mazda Tribute 4WD.  On the way to the beach, we stopped at many rest stops and shops to let the kids stretch out a little bit.  You know how that is when you are traveling with kids.  All the while, none of us ever thought about any defects that could come from this vehicle.

<b>What's so great about the LXV6 model?</b>

<i>First things first, I had enough space for my frame.</i>  Not too many vehicles can fit a 6'2&quot; frame most of the times.  I truly enjoyed the way the control panel was placed.  The limited night driving we did for dinner in Carpinteria was uneventful. Just for your information, the 2001 Mazda Tribute 4WD comes in four models such as DX, DXV6, LXV6, and ESV6.  The LX6 I was test-driving had all the standard equipments and more.  They include:

* air conditioning
* automatic transmission
* Power door locks and windows
* A roof rack you can use to carry lots of loads.  If you are cyclist, skier or snowboarder, or surfer, this is great for you!
*  80-watt AM/FM stereo with CD player
*  Aluminum alloy wheels, remote keyless entry and privacy tint in the 

In short, there are a lot of other available packages on the Mazda Tribute 4WD.

<b>Owners and shoppers should be aware of this recall</b>

<i>What's going on with all of the recent recalls regarding tires and defective parts in vehicles?  Can't manufacturers just build a vehicle once for all any longer?  </i>

On Nov. 18, Ford sent notices to dealers regarding the New Escape and Mazda Tributes.  These two vehicles share basic parts and were built in Claycomo, Mo.  The dealers were advised to check for damaged windshield wiper link ball sockets.  They are supposed to replace them.  What will happen is that the wipers could stop working due to inappropriate construction.

&lt;Recalls are very common these days! but keep your ears open and act fast&lt;/b&gt;

We can wonder why auto-makers should be in a hurry to put out unfinished vehicles or at least vehicles with major defective parts.  The previous warnings had to do with the coming off of the steering wheel, leaky fuel lines, incorrect wheel hubs and problems with the cruise control that can eventually cause the throttle to stick.  I don't think Ford wants to add another PR problem in addition to the one it currently has with the Firestone tires.  All the more reasons to put out reliable products! 

Now that I look back at all the things that could potentially go wrong, I remain thankful that we had a great trip to the coast.  No matter what, if you take all the precautions, you can end up with a state-of-the art vehicle.  But make sure that everything works on it!
