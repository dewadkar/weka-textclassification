            I have the SL wagon. This car has met all my expectations, including great acceleration, plenty of room including head and leg room. Important for my 6'2&quot; husband. All this within my budget price. It handles well especially in snow and rain. The only draw back so far is that it's not quite as large in the back as my last car, but they now have the new larger version. I have had a few little bugs, but they were quickly fixed to my satisfaction during my regular oil changes. The one time they had to keep my car, they drove me home and told me they would come get me if necessary. I'm very impressed with the customer service every time my car is seen at the dealership. I always receive response cards from the dealership, and the main office. And, usually I receive a follow up call to assure I received good service. I've never experienced this type of customer service from any other products I've purchased.
Although I've never been in an accident with my car, my sister was driving a Saturn and was told if she had been in another subcompact she would have been killed. Don't know if this is true in all cases, but it was another consideration when I chose this car.<br><br>
