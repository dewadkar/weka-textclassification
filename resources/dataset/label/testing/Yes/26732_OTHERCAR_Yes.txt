            The Olympus 360L is a perfect digital camera for those people that never owned one before.  It is also one of the best values today for a quality mega pixel camera.  I got mines for about $280 online, which should be a little cheaper by now.  First off the camera is also one of the best looking digital cameras around.  It really looks just like a regular camera, many people don't even know I'm using a digital camera.  It comes with a 8 mb SmartMedia card which is good for about 40 or so high quality pics or 100 lower quality pics(use for web).  The batteries really drain on this camera.  If you don't have the rechargable batteries or AC adapter(which doesn't come with the camera) expect to go down to Costo to pick up batteries cause you'll need them.  The camera it self uses 4 AA batteries.
Overall I definitely recommend this camera.  It is very convinient and cool :)  <br><br>
