            After buyin the Toyota Camry 99 Xle V6, I have had nothing but pleasure driving it. At 25,000 miles, there is not a bit of problems. The engine is still very quiet, and the gas mileage is very good. Everything still rides and works like new. It rides smooth and quiet and there is nothing not to love. The braking is excellent and the car comes with complete luxuries including leather, spacious intererior, a CD player and 6 speakers, and even nice hub-caps. The trunk is extremely large, even able to fit two of my golf bags and a golf caddy. The windows are, of course automatic and both the driver and passenger seats have electronic reclining buttons. This car even compares to a Mercedes or BMW.

After reading don't forget to comment on it.    <br><br>
