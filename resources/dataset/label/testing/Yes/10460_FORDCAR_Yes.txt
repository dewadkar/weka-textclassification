            After going to dealership after dealership, looking at sticker prices that I really wasn't sure that I wanted to dish out, my husband drives up to the house one night in a beautiful 1993 white Ford Explorer Limited and says if you want it, it's yours. There it was, my dream SUV sitting outside my house, saying, &quot;Please buy me!&quot;  Our friends had decided to sell their Explorer, that by the way, was in Showroom quality.  It was 2 years old, with 20,xxx miles and had sat in a garage with a tarp over it when not being driven.  I said, &quot;How much?&quot;  And my next words were, &quot;Sold!&quot;  I have never regretted my decision.  
I love my Explorer because not only is it fun to drive, it's a great family car. There is room for 5 people and plenty of cargo room in the rear.  The back seat can be folded down to allow for additional cargo space or leave half the seat up for seating and additional cargo space.
The leather interior is great, especially when you have children.  Spills are cleaned easily and no more worrying about wet bathing suits leaving wet spots on the seats.  I like the convenience of a compass(my husband says this is truly a women's car) and a thermometer on the rear view mirror. The rear window can be lifted up to remove items from the cargo space or the hatch can be lifted.  It has locking windows and doors from the driver's door and also there is safety switches on rear doors to prevent them from being opened from the inside. 
The four wheel drive can be engaged from the inside by the mere push of a button.  I live in the country and after a big snow, the lane to my house is often drifted shut. Snow plows don't plow private lanes and in fact often push more snow at the end of your lane when clearing the main road.  Therefore, on many occasions, I have engaged the four wheel drive just to get out to the main road, then with a push of a button I am again in two wheel drive and on my way without ever having to leave my warm SUV.
Another thing that I like about my Explorer is the visibility that you have when driving. Since owning a SUV I'm not sure that I will ever go back to driving a car.  I think that you have to be a defensive driver and watch out for the other guy, with a Explorer you can see him coming first!
So do I have any cons about the Explorer?  Sure, but not very many and not enough that I am unhappy about my decision.  The price, almost $30,000 new and $20,000 used!  I think that all SUV's are overpriced and not just the Explorer.  My answer, buy used if you can't afford a new one! I wish that the rear window would roll down versus raising up!  Big deal right!  Told you!  I love my SUV!  I have had many people call me and ask me how much I wanted to sell it for because the wanted to buy it!  It's not for sale! I now have 140,000 miles on it and it's still going strong.  I will drive it until I have to haul it away and give it a proper burial. Then more than likely I will go and buy another one just like it! <br><br>
