            After a lifetime of conventional 4-wheeled transport, I decided a while back to treat myself to a 2-seater convertible just for the hell of it.  I checked out the Z3 when it was first released, but at that time decided on the compact 318ti instead as it seemed more solidly built. However, when I started car-hunting again last September, one test drive was all it took to convince me that the Z4 was a totally different kettle of fish to its predecessor. I placed my order as soon as I returned the test car to the dealer.  Best decision I've ever made!  I went for the 2.5 liter Steptronic, as the manual(SMG) version is only fitted to the 3.0 over here in Japan, and unlike the States, there is a $10,000 difference in the price between the two engines!  Admittedly, the 3.0 has the Sports package as standard, (18" wheels, leather interior) but unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not find the standard 16 inchers a problem in terms of either appearance or handling. In fact, I prefer their ride after having tried another Z4 fitted with the larger set. A lot easier on the back, I can tell you!   I do agree that the seats are a little thin on bolstering, and could do with some sort of lumbar adjustment.(a la new 5 series)  I took the salesman's advice by having the (cloth)seats re-upholstered in leather (before delivery) by a local custom interior shop, who also fitted additional cushioning and seat-heaters. It certainly looks and feels lot better than the factory optioned leather package, and was significantly cheaper!   
     This is one heck of a car! It's design may not be to everyone's taste,(judging by some of the reviews) but from personal experience, it sure is a head-turner once the top is down! I've heard nothing but praise for it's revolutionary styling,particularly in the stunning "Maldive Blue" finish I chose.  I'm 6ft and go 185lbs, and I've got room to spare (head & shoulder-wise), which is a lot more than I could say for the Porsche Boxster I took for a spin. It may not have the on-road performance of the Boxster, but I wanted it primarily as a wind-in-the-hair cruiser, not to chuck around mountain roads and terrify the life out of my wife. I'm a bit past that stage!   Fuel consumption is a little heavy around town, (I live in Tokyo; the main reason for going automatic!)  but improves dramatically on the open road. I'm getting around 17-28 mpg depending on the conditions.   One gripe that I do have is the quality of the BMW sound systems. I've had 3 BM's now, and they've all sounded pretty thin & reedy in this department. Even running 8 speakers, it's still lacking any real substance, so maybe the optional Carver system (10 speakers with sub-woofers) is a worthwhile consideration.(if a bit pricey!)  Also, the steering does take a little getting used to, as it doesn't have the usual self-centering feeling to it that comes with a conventional set-up.  You find yourself having to physically turn the wheel back to the straight-ahead position. Not a bad thing, but a little disconcerting at first.   I'm not totally sold on this Run-flat tire system either. It's fine to say that you can run for 100 miles at 50mph with no air in the tire, but what happens if you're stuck in the middle of nowhere when you puncture, or more critically, if you have a blow-out?  No problem in Japan, as it's only 15 minutes between gas-stations anywhere you go, but what about in the middle of Nevada?
     Quality-wise, the panel-fit, paintwork and interior are all first-rate, and the Navigation system (at least, in Japan) is a real bonus. The car handles like a dream, stops on a dime, and Oh, that beautiful engine!  If there's a smoother six out there, I'd like to find it!   Can't wait for the Z5 (or would that be Z6 with the new numbering system?)
