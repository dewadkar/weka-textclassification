            Want a car smaller than the Expedition but larger than a Durango?  The new 2000 Chevy Tahoe is for you.  Let's start with the specifications and options, shall we?  The Tahoe come in four different trim levels: LS, LT, SLE, SLT.  For 2000, the Tahoe offers a more room, better ride and handling, and this year it has a more rigid body structure.  The new Tahoe offers an optional 3rd row seat, a Z71 off-road package, a towing package, and a preferred equipment group that includes a nine-speaker AM/FM/cassette/CD sound system, leather seating surfaces, Onstar commmunications system, and aluminum wheels.  

I recently bought the new Tahoe in LT trim level.  I also added the 3rd row seat option($750) and the LT preferred equipment package($10,587).  The Tahoe also carried a 4WD system that could be switched from 4WD to the fuel-saving 2WD mode.  Although the Tahoe has a base price of $27,845, after all of the options its price tag rocketed to $41,109.  My Tahoe also came with the optional 5.3 liter/285 horsepower/345 pounds per foot of torque engine.  Enough of options let's talk about how this car really drives.


My friend has a 1999 Chevy Tahoe, and I can tell you that the new 2000 Tahoe drives a lot better.  It has more of a car-like driveability than you would expect in a SUV this size.  The new Tahoe's tighter turning radius is also a big plus for all of you off-roaders.  All in all, this is the best SUV I have driven and I think you will feel the same.
