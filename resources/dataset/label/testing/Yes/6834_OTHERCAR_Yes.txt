            The 1995 Legacy Outback was really a Legacy with a different option package.  When the dealer told me that the 96 Outback would be different, but $4K more, I opted for the 95 version.  The 95 has the regular suspension, riding lower than the subsequent model years.  

I've had my wagon for just under 5 years and 63K miles now.  The quality of construction has been great.  The fit and finish and the mechanics have held up great.  The handling is great.

Cons: This is not a quiet car with the large air space behind the rear seats, there is significant wind noise.  Much needed headrests for the rear seats came in 96.<br><br>
