            I have a 92 chevy lumina with over 150,000 miles and love it....
Although I have had my share of problems with it, I am still a happy chevy owner. My wife is currently driving it toteing my son around doing daily errands. She is quite petite and does not like big cars, so this one is perfect for her (size wize). I am happy with its very solid american car feel. Its size is right between a compact and a luxury car. After all these miles Ive had,
the transmission filter changed&lt;&lt;  I thought I would have to replace it (whew)
A whole new cooling system put in&lt;&lt;&lt; the old radiator was part plastic(yuk)All new metal radiators are not cheap 900.00
Tires and the usual small things...
If you ever get a chance to ride in one they are very comfortable,roomy, and my v6 pumps power for having so many miles.
I would say that this car would be great for the beginner executive type.
p.s. when you want to change the spark plugs you cannot directly access the three farthest plugs.(the motor has to be unbolted and tilted)weird huh?<br><br>
