            I bought my '92 Camry during my senior year of high school.  I knew that I wanted a used car because that was all I could afford.  I loved the look of the camry which was the new version, very rounded, no more boxed look.  I had also heard that camrys are very reliable.  So I bought the car, and have been driving it for two years...with virtually no problems.  The car itself is not very old, but when I bought it there were already 100,000 miles on it.  Now there are 130,000 miles on it and it is running as well as the day I got it.  It is a very comfortable car...plenty of room both front seat and back, plus a lot of trunk space for a compact.  It is a heavy car so it does well in the rain and snow.  It is four cylinder, but since it is a smaller car...the pickup is great and so is the riding.  It is a smooth ride and very easy to drive.  It is a perfect car for anyone, and a great car for a teenager just starting for a couple of reasons.  First because it is easy to handle and it is safe and heavy as I said before.  And second because it is a nice looking car that will not break the bank.  Overall I am very happy with my decision.  <br><br>
