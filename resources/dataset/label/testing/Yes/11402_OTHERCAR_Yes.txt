                 When designing the 2000 Toyota 4Runner, the folks at Toyota must have considered the wants of every single individual in the market for a sport-utility.  From the driver's seat, there are minimal blind spots, and overall view is good.  Controls for the sound system as well as the optional automatic climate control are easily reached.
  
     The seating is firm but spacious enough for even an above average-sized adult, both in the front and rear seats.  Toyota has done something with the 4-wheel drive engagement that I personally admire....while there is a pushbutton, there is still a lever as well.  It is not only a pushbutton system (4-high, limited slip), but 4-high and 4-low (rear lock) are still operated by lever.

     I put more faith in this 4-wheel drive system (and have the 
results to prove it) based not only on Toyota's superb off-road capabilities in the past, but on actually driving one in three feet of snow.  In the past, the 4Runner has given very, very few problems, so reliability is well above average.  The acceleration is somewhat sluggish, but there is plenty of power to pass on the highway.  

     Braking distance is surprisingly short, and fuel mileage is average.  There is plenty of room for a couple of golf bags, a cooler, and a change of clothes in the rear cargo area, and a tonneau to hide your cargo if necessary. 

     Overall, considering the average price of the Limited model (about $40,000.00 US), I still feel that you are getting more vehicle than what you are paying for, considering the 2000 4Runner is just as welcome in the parking lot of the Ritz as it is in hazardous-terrain environments. <br><br>
