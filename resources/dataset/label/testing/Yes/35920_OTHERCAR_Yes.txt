                I bought my MR2 just two weeks ago.  I found it on AutoTrader.com and had to drive 200 miles to see it.  When the owner (who had to drive 270 miles to meet me) arrived, I fell in love with the cars look immediately.  Black, shiny, TSW wheels, and a beautiful body.  It had the 2.2 litre engine and it sounded great.  I had just driven a 93 MR2 two days earlier and loved the way it handled.  So when I drove this 91 I knew what to expect.  I made the owner a little nervous when I fishtailed out of the Texaco we met at and sped off to about 70 mph.  I loved the drive and bought it right there.  As I was filling up with gas, two young, attractive, female gas attendants pumped my gas and remarked about how nice the car was and how they would take a ride if they weren't on the clock.  Heh, heh.  
    So now it is two weeks later and I am discovering some things.  The car is a babe-magnet.  It's uncanny how much of "it" the car pulls in.  I love the fishtail factor and one day it will probably get me in trouble with Johnny Law.  The car takes off just as quick as any other NA sports car in it's class.  The handling is unreal.  Solid suspension make it bouncy going over the speed bump in front of K-Mart but I wouldn't trade that smoothness around the hairpin turn at 55 mph for anything.  In fact I get to take it to my old stomping grounds 50 miles outside of town and I can't wait.  
    But there are some negatives too.  The car has 81,000 miles on it so some trouble is understandable and quite easy to handle.  First off the thing that is really bothering me the most is downshift from 3rd to 2nd.  I get a nasty grind every time I do it.  And I mean every time.  Second, the air-conditioning is out.  This is really expensive to get fixed because I have to convert the air-conditioning from R-12 freon to R-34.  Spendy.  Third at high speeds but not max speeds (e.g. 70-95 mph) the car shimmies a little.  Not a big deal but a deal non-the-less.  
    I think that for MR2's in general (meaning not just mine) the only problem with them is the seats.  They are great for tooling around town but I wouldn't recommend driving this car for more that an hour at a time.  Your buns will start to ache.  And as everyone should know the car only seats two so leave the kids at home.  But you wouldn't want them around anyways when the gorgeous blond in the Mustang next to you smiles and when the light turns green you blow her and her stupid Ford out of the water.  
    In short, the car is awesome but we are still really getting to know each other.  I would suggest that if you are thinking of buying a sports car that you seriously consider the MR2.  The car is super rare, drives fantastic, loves the ladies, and is fairly comfortable.  Don't buy it if you aren't going to respect it though.  The instant you think you are better than the car, you will be in a ditch.  This car isn't meant for stupid 18 year old football players that think it will drive the same as their old Nova.
