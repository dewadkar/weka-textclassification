            My 1998 Ford Ranger is a standard transmission and I've been happy with it since buying it.
I decided to buy the Ranger instead of other trucks because it was the most comfortable of all makes and models I tried (that list includes Nissan, Toyota and Dodge light trucks). The bucket-type seats are easy on my back and comfortable to sit in for long drives (I made a 19-hour drive in my Ranger in December 1998). The driver/passenger panel (where the air conditioning and heating and radio buttons are) is easy to reach and easy to use.
The main factors in favor of this truck in my opinion are that it offers superior comfort as light trucks go and that it is priced affordably (I have seen the Ranger advertised in my area everywhere from $9,000 to $14,000, depending on which options and packages you get) I wanted one with no add-ons except air-conditioning and that's what I got. No carpet means it's a breeze to clean (and keep clean). Your gas mileage will depend on the terrain where you live, how far you drive and whether those are city streets or interstates (stop and go driving uses more gas).
The factors working against this truck in my opinion are that it is a 'light' truck, which means it's not as heavy as some other vehicles and can be bounced around easily by strong winds. I have also noticed that the engine in my Ranger races at odd times and I'll have to take it to my mechanic to have this fixed, but it's been a recurring problem. Not a serious problem, but a recurring one nonetheless.
People who should buy this type of truck include people who own livestock trailers (big enough for one or two animals -- the bumper can't support larger vehicles in tow) or small watercraft that need to be towed behind. People who need to have the extra space a truck bed can provide for moving things, taking things to the shop and so on. It's also an ideal vehicle for single people or people who don't have regular passengers riding with them.
People who should not buy this vehicle include parents of more than one child because three or more people cannot fit comfortably in the cab.<br><br>
