            Have a neighbor who seems to find any and every possible way to annoy you.  No problem.  All you must do is purchase a Mercedes Benz 300D and be certain to start it up very, very early each morning.  I assure that within one week a for sale sign will magically appear besides your nieghbors mailbox.
However, the cacaphony of bangs and metallic clanks which greet you every time you prepare to travel seem like a small price to pay when considering all the positive attributes of the vehicle.
I recently had the oppurtunity to drive a Diesel Mercedes for the first time over the holidays.  A good friend had gone away and allowed me to sample driving his 1987 Mercedes 300D.  Expecting the worst I planted myself behind the REALLY big steering wheel and enjoyed the suprisingly comfortable seats.  At 6'2&quot; I had no problems finding a position that was comfortable for me. However, the back seat passenger directly behind me became very unhappy.  The power functions all still worked and the interior was quite spacious.  The Mercedes elegant body design is timeless and helps this 12 year old car look as good as any mid-1990's Mercedes-Benz. 
As far as the performance is concerned, it was a love and hate relationship.  I loved the smooth, very quiet ride.  I hated getting beat off the line by 85 year old Gladis in her 1980 oldsmobile.  Although the turbo charger helps compensate for the Diesel engine its still a Diesel engine.  Don't get me wrong diesel is great on mileage and is built stronger but it still accelerates slowly .
This particular Diesel impressed me when I learned the odometer stopped working at 138,164 miles in 1991.  The current driver estimates that his commute alone has put it well over 300,000 miles.  Even so the car feels as safe and well built as the day the dealer parted with it.  Today give that Mercedes a couple minutes to warm up and be patient as you accelerate.  Just like the 2000's, this mercedes will get you where you are going in peace, comfort and style. <br><br>
