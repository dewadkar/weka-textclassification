            I had a 91 Ford Probe that I bought new.  It was a 5 speed, 4 cylinder GL.  Brakes and parts lasted normal amounts of time. I am a veterinarian and put a lot of miles on the car going to and from work.  Routine maintenance and a paint job were the main expenses until I got to 100,000 miles.  I had the throttle stick once at about 30,000 miles and had to replace the brakes because of that, but it never happened again.  The paint had to be redone in 1996, but I had a really good body shop repaint the car.  As I got to 100,000, I had to replace the clutch and radiator. Next, the exhaust pipes had to be replaced. At 110,000, I had to replace the struts, brakes and cv boots.  Father's Day 2000, a drunk driver  (100mph) rear ended the car on the highway at night.  I was traveling 66mph on cruise control.  I was sent into a spin and bounced off the guard rail 2 or 3 times until finally able to stop the car.  Needless to say the car was totaled, but I walked away from the accident with only minor injuries.  I had planned on never selling that car.  If the engine had finally gone, I would have replaced the engine.  I always felt safe in that car and the accident proved me right.  I would recommend one to anybody who wanted a hassle free, safe car.
