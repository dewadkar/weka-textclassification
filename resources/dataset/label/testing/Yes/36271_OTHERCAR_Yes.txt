            I bought this vehicle after much searching and asking of questions and opinions.  You see I live in a small town and I am a nurse, my job requires that I travel 56 miles one way to work- 5 days a week.  I bought this vehicle in 1998 just before I graduated from registered nursing school.  As of today I have 61,000 miles on it and have only had to have scheduled oil changes and new tires.  I have not even had to replace the brake pads yet,  I just had them checked and they are still okay.  

The only part that is inconveinent about this vehicle is lack of leg room in the back seat, but that is easily dealt with when you consider what a great car this is.  My mom owns a 2000 chevy 4 door compact vehicle and my car runs smoother and the engine does not work as hard.  This vehicle is great for someone who drives alot of miles but needs as something with great looks and room to sit also.  We use this vehicle for alot of family trips and it is wonderful. 

 I would recommend this for people who just want a great running and pretty smooth riding vehicle for the less money that most American made vehicles that are comparable.  <br><br>
