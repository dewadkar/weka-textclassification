            We have a 1998 Mountaineer and are somewhat satisfied. Rides great for a SUV, better than most. Really quiet. Have the large V6 and love it. Good acceleration and moves when it has to. Haven't had any problems other than 3 recalls.  We compared to Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Durango, Chevy Blazer. Most room for the dollar.  Good gas milage. We now have 28,000 on it and still like it. Rides better loaded. It came with the Firestone Wilderness tires and I like them. Good stereo and really innovative rear seat console controls.
I have some complaints though.  Why doesn't it have Flow-thru and re-circulated air? Why does the interior lights go out as soon as you shut the door? Most todays car's it slowly dims out.  Why doesn't it have Day-time driving lights? For $31,000, why doesn't it have a glove compartment light? Why doesn't it have a place to hang the gas cap? The drive seat is 6 way powered seat and no matter where you adjust it, it is very un-comfortable, should have purchased the leather seats. Why doesn't it have a 3rd head rest in the rear seat? When the driver gets out, why doesn't all the doors &quot;automatically&quot; open? It's a problem when I get out and go to open the back door only to find it is locked. So I have to remember to hit the unlock button before I get out.<br><br>
