            I wish I could already describe the breathtaking feeling of driving the new stylish BMW M3, but we all know, it's not out yet.  You can't even see the picture in any of the magazines.  Nevertheless, you don't really have a choice to wait for a test drive, if you want the car once it is available at the dealership.

The sales of the new 3 series has broken new records and forecasts predict the same for the new M3 models, especially since the production numbers are so small. Many BMW dealerships started their &quot;M3 buyers' list&quot; early last year and only the few top names on the list will be the first ones to drive it on the streets.  If you haven't done it yet, now is the time to secure yourself a spot on that list.  

Depending on the dealership, you can accomplish that by putting a small deposit down toward the lease or purchase.  If you want to increase your chances of receiving your car right away, you might consider putting down a deposit with more than one dealership.  The deposits are refundable in case you decide not to buy it, so no money is lost.  Simply contact the dealership in your area, ask for the sales manager or your sales representative and find out if such a list exists.  If not, then I am sure the dealership will be happy to start one, with you as number one on the list.  Good luck!!!<br><br>
