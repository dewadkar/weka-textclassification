                 I was lucky enough to visit Autobahn in San Mateo, CA for a test drive of the CL500.  Went there about a month ago, didn't have time to write a review right away, but at that time, there were 2 2000 CL500's and 1 2001 CL500's.  This is the thing, they're suppose to go for only 80K, but they were asking 130K!!!  Anyways, this is how the car drives.

     Since this car has a shorter chassis, the car drives totally different with an &quot;S&quot; class, not to mention &quot;ABC&quot; (Active Body Control) system on the car.  It's the BEST system I have ever experienced on a car.  The suspension system basically will adjust by itself minimizing the car's body roll to the fullest extent...&quot;this suspension system, utilizes a coil spring and an electronically controlled hydraulic cylinder in series, plus a separate gas-pressurized shock absorber at each wheel.  ABC also provides automatic 4-wheel level control, driver-selectable ride height control and gradual automatic lowering at higher speeds. Driver-selectable Sport mode virtually eliminates body roll for even flatter cornering and sharper handling response&quot;...  We took the Belmont exit which had a 25 MPH speed limit at 50 MPH without feeling any body roll on the car.  The interior of the car has hand sewed consoles, which really helped making the CL500 one of the most luxurious coupe on the earth.
