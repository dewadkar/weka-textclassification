            I will begin reviewing the D-340 Itself but if you're not sold on a digital camera, read the last couple of paragraphs.

The D-340 is a beautiful machine.  This is too much camera for the money.  Olympus must have made a mistake when the priced a 1280x960 digital camera below $600 and to think that you can get this one for around $300!

   The best way to go about this review is for me to compare the Olympus to the Sony Mavica, which I have also used extensively before. The Sony had a high quality resolution of 800x600.  The Olympus resolution is 1280x960.  This makes a huge difference in picture quality.  The Olympus takes pictures that are over 50% clearer.  The Mavica uses 3.5&quot; floppy disks to sore it's photos - which is a great idea, but the camera has to be large enough to accommodate the both the optics and the diskette drive for storage.  Also, the capacity of the 3.5&quot; disk is only 1.44 MB.  Which means only four or five 800x600 images per disk.  If you're taking lots of pictures, you need to carry around lots of floppies which are a large burden on pocket space and can be easily damaged.  The Olympus uses a super-thin memory card that is about an inch long.  The cards can hold up to 64MB of memory.  My 8MB card holds about 22 images at the 1280x960 resolution.  Granted the cards are more expensive than floppies - actually they're not cheap at all, but they're worth it for the convenience of their size.  The mavica I used had a few more features than the Olympus, but the features the Mavica had were colorization processes that could just as easily be done in Photoshop or PhotoPaint.  Yes, it is easier to transfer the Mavica photos to the computer, but not by much.  The Olympus came with a floppy disk adapter so that I can slide the memory card into the adapter, then the adapter into my computer, and I can manipulate the files just like they were on a floppy disk.  The Sony at the time cost around $500-600.  My Olympus was $350.

  There are some problems with the Olympus, however.  The camera is not loaded with features.  The functions are basic, but truthfully, I have never missed the options that drive other camera prices through the roof such as zoom and video features.  The Camera I bought has a few dead pixels on the LCD screen.  And the most annoying quirk is that the power supply is terrible.  After a few minutes of use - perhaps five or six pictures even with a new set of batteries - the camera flashes low battery.  After I give the camera a few minutes of rest, however, the batteries work fine again.  This is really obnoxious and I don't know for sure if this is just a problem that my camera has or if it's a problem across the whole line.

  Overall, I am extremely impressed with the D-340.  I would definitely buy another Olympus digital camera.  This camera does everything I want it to and has become such a wonderful tool for so many things.

WHY TO BUY DIGITAL

  Due to the extremely high cost of owning a digital camera in the years past, I tried to ignore the benefits of having a digital camera.  It was not until I received the Olympus D-340 as a Christmas gift, that I could admit my denial.  This camera is an exceptionally sweet piece of equipment.   There are so many benefits to owning a digital camera that to put them in paragraph form would be ridiculous, so I will simply list them:

- Ever hear someone say &quot;Will you make me a copy of that?&quot;  First of all, how often does it happen that the copy is actually made?  And second, what a pain in the neck to remember which picture it was and how many and what does it cost and who's it for?  With a digital camera, you can simply say:  &quot;I'll e-mail you the whole roll!&quot;  Very nice.
- Excellent for making a web page (You don't have to develop and scan photos of your friends or product)
- Great for customizing Windows wallpaper
- Great for e-mailing family and friends to keep them updated
- Great for making pictures for auctions (such as EBAY)

Hope this helps,
