            The other day on the advice of my children, I went car shopping.  I test drove a Saturn, a Kia (which I also loved) and a <b>Cadilac Eldorado Sport Coupe</b>.  After driving about a half of a block, I decided to take my time.  I enjoyed this car so much, I wanted to get the most out of the test drive and stay in it as long as I could.  This was like driving a dream compared to any other car I have ever driven.  Okay, so I haven�t driven very many, but I know a dream when I feel one.  At my age I have to enjoy feeling anything as long as I can.  

The <b>Cadilac Eldorado Sport Coupe</b> has a 275-horsepower Northstar V8 engine.  That is how the manufacturer lists it.  To me it simply means a smooth and powerful ride.  Instant pickup at a light so I don�t feel like I am creating traffic every time it turns green.  There is only one thing worse than some big jerk guy yelling �Come on� Lady!� and that is hearing, �Come on� Grandma!�  Arrghghh!!  I�d leave him in the dust in this baby!  I would do it in extreme comfort too.   The leather-trimmed seats are so soft and they are bucket seats so that adds to my driving comfort.  

The whole interior of the car is beautiful.  From the supple leather trimmed seats to the leather wrapped steering wheel with adjustable tilt, this car has class.  A real plus is this thing they call <b>�programmable personalization features.�</b>  To explain this the way it was explained to me I should call it <b>�My passport to luxury�</b>.  There is a keyless pad that I can attach to my keychain, it holds my personal setting information.  I can preset the way I want the seat and the mirrors to be adjusted for me so that every time I open the door with my keyless pad, it adjusts automatically.  That means that if my daughter or anyone else has a key to my car, their key will do the same for them.  In other words, no more mirror adjustment battles and no more constant seat changing.

Something I learned about this car that I feel was good to know even though I�ll never notice it, the special ability of the Northstar System.  It works behind the scenes to track and audit the activity of the V8 engine, suspension, steering, anti-lock braking and traction systems.  It monitors the driver�s input, factoring in road conditions and makes undetectable changes while you drive.  You won�t notice this going on, it just does it for you.  What you will notice is that no matter where you drive or what condition you drive in, you�ll have a smooth, steady ride.

Since test driving this car, I have decided two things.  

1) I am going to test drive many more to see what compares in making me feel that comfortable and in control.
2) I am saving.  I think I may have found my dream car!


On top of everything else, I was told this baby gets great highway mileage.  I wouldn�t know though, because the man from the dealership made me take it back after our little, very short (to me) 45-minute test-drive.  I am sorry to inform you that I never even looked at the gas gauge.  I do know that it runs on 8 cylinders with 32 valves and still delivers excellent gas mileage for this vehicle class.
