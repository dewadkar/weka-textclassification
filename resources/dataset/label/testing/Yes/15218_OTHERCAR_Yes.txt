            I recently bought my 2000 Toyota Sienna and so far I am completely satisfied with the comfort and quality of this vehicle. I love the powerful 3000cc V6. The 194 horsepower has come in very handy when I hauled everything from my living room to seven grown adults. Although the Sienna is not considered one of the &quot;big&quot; minivans, I find it very comfortable and just perfect for my family of four! This is a perfect car if you don't have a big family. There are also a lot of places to store useful things. However, the best reason that I chose the Sienna was its reliability, I have owned defective cars all my life and I am happy that for once I own a car that I can depend on for long trips and everyday chores.<br><br>
