            How to start?  I bought a Ford Escape XLT 4X4 for my wife as we needed a new car here in western nevada.  We've had it for about 3 weeks and put about 4000 miles on it with a cross country road trip to the mid west.  This thing all in all is a solid dependable vehicle with minimal personality.  It comes from the factory with a set of Continental Contitrac SUV tires.  Believe me these aren't car tires and that shows up in the road noise.  I have read elsewhere in other reviews peoples various complaints about the Escape and frankly while most of them are valid it seems that they refuse to take into account that suvs are a compromise between pick-up trucks and passenger cars.  Based on my experience the Ford Escape is the result of a number of compromises.  On with the meat of the review.

Exterior:
Personally I like the overall appearance.  Our truck is "satin silver" so it hides the dirt and salt well.  Just from looking at it, it looks smaller than it actually is.  Getting in and out of the truck can be a real challenge for small children but my wife (5'2") and I (6'1") don't have any problem at all. ground clearance is all around good with the exception of of the secondary catalytic converter.  this thing is the lowest point on the truck and with no doubt get scraped on a tall speed bump.

Interior:
in a nutshell it's huge.  We got the power drivers seat and my wife and I have no problem getting comfortable.  The only thing I can say about the drivers seat is that the seat bottom could be an inch or two longer and it needs an adjustable lumbar support.  The controls are all clearly marked and with the exception of the AM/FM-CD button are all easy to reach.  The reason the AM/FM-CD button can be a challenge to reach is when the shifter is in Drive the handle is just a hair below the button.  One other glaring ergonomic hit which makes me glad that it's my wife's truck: the pedal spacing.  The gas pedal and brake pedal are simply too close together.  I have size 12 feet and it took me a few hours to figure out how to find the gas pedal without also finding the brake.  Ford needs to address this issue with the '05s. 

Driving:
Overall it is a very neutral feel.  I think you would be making a dangerous mistake in thinking that because this is a compact uni-body based suv that it drives like a car. This is an suv it's tall big and feels heavy.  The 3L v-6 is absolutely perfect for this sized vehicle.  The take offs are crisp and solid the automatic transmission shifts are firm an authoritative.  The suspension is a bit on the stiff side but I've noticed that when the truck is loaded it feels softer.  That should be expected given its 3500 lbs towing capacity.  The brakes are adequete but not up to the rest of this machine.  When braking the truck stops in a completely straight line with no tendancy to pull to one side or the other.  In snowy conditions this vehicle is completly predictable.

In short 2004 Ford XLT 4X4 is a solid vehicle that is slightly to the truck end of the compact suv crowd unlike the more car like CRV.  If you want a small suv that can handle a family of four on a long trip in snow and ice.  than this is definatly worth looking at.
