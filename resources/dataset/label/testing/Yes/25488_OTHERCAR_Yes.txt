            I bought this car in March 1998, and I have enjoyed every moment of it. I test drove all the other comparable cars in this class and even the Honda Accord and Toyota Camary. I thought the price of this car and the style were perfect for me. I asked other family and friends about their opinions of this car and car company and heard little to few complaints. 
I especially enjoyed the whole buying process of this car company. I searched for a new car for several months, and I was sick and tired of car dealerships acting as if I didn't exist. I thought that they were open and explained things regarding the car in simple terms that I could understand and grasp. The car is comfortable and quite economical. I get phenomenal gas mileage and it is my decompression chamber at the end of the day. The one complaint that I have on this car is that my passengers have a difficult time getting out of the car. I would have to caution people who may have some mobility problems need to investigate this further. Driving this vehicle is a breeze, and it handles well on the road. My roommate has a BMW, and she enjoys going in my Saturn as much I enjoy her car due to the ease in driving. I think that anyone who is wanting a comfortable car with easy care and affordable would be impressed by this car and car company. <br><br>
