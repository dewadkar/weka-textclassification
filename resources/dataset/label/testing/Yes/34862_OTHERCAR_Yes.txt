            <b>Please see the end of the opinion for updated information</b>

As the birth of our second baby approached, we decided it was time for a roomier car.  Since our first would only be 18 months old at the time, we needed something big.  Big enough for 2 car seats, strollers, diaper bags, toys, etc...

The Odyssey is something else.  It's big and has awesome features.  The best thing has got to be that back seat.  It's comfortable for both kids and adults to sit on, it folds easily into the floor making a ton of room, it's great for tailgating parties and has made a wonderful emergency changing table!  We also love the fact that the middle seats can either be together or apart.  With 2 young kids, this feature will be a life saver!  With the back seat down and the captains chairs out, there is ample room for cargo.  You could fit a twin bed and more!  We also like that it sits high, giving us great view of the road and traffic.  The dual power sliding doors on the EX model are great, but for us, have been a bother.

Now to the problems.  It just may be our luck to have these problems because we have asked other Odyssey owners and no one else that we've spoken with has had them.  First off, less than 3 weeks after getting it, the sliding doors started giving us problems.  One would jam and the other would not close properly.  According to the dealership, there is a problem with the latches.  It seemed serious enough that the service rep wasn't comfortable letting us drive it until it was fixed because she was afraid the door may open suddenly.  We even got a rental van while the repairs were made.

Second, the rubber around the wing/spoiler totally came off.  Third, there was a problem with the body in one of the wheel wells.  The mechanic at the dealership said he had never seen a frame problem like this on an Odyssey (Just our luck?).  We've had creaks and rattles already and have had the van less than 3 months.  Another peeve is the location of the power seat adjustments on the driver's seat.  Many times as we exit the vehicle, the button covers get stuck on our clothes and pop off.

The van drives well and is a good value.  It may be that our van got all the problems because all I've heard from other owners are praises.  The van is a must for families with young kids.  Regardless of the problems we have had, I would recommend this van to others.


<b>UPDATE</b>

<b>Well, our Odyssey is now 9 months old and we have had our van in for service on the power sliding doors twice more since I wrote the original opinion.  We mostly keep having problems with one door locking itself unexpectedly, even when all others remain unlocked.  A couple of times it has failed to close properly and other times, it will close properly, but the "open door" alarm will sound anyway. (REALLY ANNOYING!)

I'm hoping that the problem has been resolved.  Apparently, the connector was not grounding properly, causing our myriad of door problems.   I think this problem may be more common than I thought.  I say this because on my paper from the service there was a notation "TSB".  I asked a friend that's knowledgeable in the automobile field about it and he told me that it stood for "Technical Service Bulletin" and that these are sometimes put out in connection with recalls or for troubleshooting purposes.  The fact that there was a TSB out for this problem leads me to believe we are not the only ones experiencing it!

After living with our Odyssey for the last 9 months, I have come to love or dislike some features that I may not have outlined in the first opinion:

**LOVE**

1.  I cannot say enough about the innovative back seat.  The deep well in the trunk is outstanding!  I usually have a single AND a double stroller in there, and I always have room for groceries, umbrellas, diaper bags, toys and more.  And I love how easily the back row folds right into the well making oodles more room.  And I can do this all by myself since it's not necessary to remove the whole bench.

2.  Although they have been problematic at times, I absolutely love the power sliding doors.  They have made my life so much easier!  I like being able to open both doors while holding my 2 kids or have the doors open when we make a mad dash for the van in the rain.

3.  This is a biggie with my husband - we have not experienced any rattles!

4.  This is a biggie with me - I really enjoy the many configurations of the power driver seat.

**ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT**

1. The power doors are quite loud when opened or closed.  My poor kids always get startled when I open the doors.

2  Storage - I wish there were more little cubby holes around the van.  Seat back pockets are OK, but things tend to get lost in there.  I thought the little folding tray between the front seats was neat at first, but now I wish that it was a real console will lots of storage.  We have so much stuff in the van because of the kids and really nowhere to put it.

3. The cupholders are all mediocre at best.  They don't hold things securely!

4.  Some of the safety features are a bit annoying.  I commend Honda for thinking so much about safety, but I wish they left some options up to the owner.  First, if you have power sliding doors, you MUST put the car in Park before you can open the doors.  Second, there's a little alarm that sounds continuously if one or both  of the sliding doors is not closed properly.  It sounds if you try to open the doors when they're locked.  It sounds if you try to open them while driving.  AND it's really loud.  I'm glad that the doors don't open when locked or when the car is moving, but is the added noise really necessary?  Is there an off switch?

All in all, we are still very happy with our Odyssey, and it has and will continue meeting our needs in every way - EVERYDAY!</b>
