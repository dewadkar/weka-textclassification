            I love gadgets, so when digital cameras came on the scene I wanted one soooo badly, but they were sooooo expensive! So I waited and waited and FINALLY I found a great deal on the Kodak DC-215.

This camera is very easy to use! I did not take great pictures with my regular camera but hey, if I don't like what I see in the viewfinder, I can instantly delete it &amp; try again!

I use it a lot at the school I work at and we have found a lot of creative ways to use it. Last year the kids made Mother's day cards &amp; we were able to put their pictures on them. We were assured of great pictures because we could review them before printing instead of being disappointed when pictures come back from regular film.

Transferring pictures is a breeze with this camera as is everything thing about this camera, and I find my prints turning out quite well for a 1 megapixel camera.

I find my only problem is that my family is sick of me taking their pictures so often, so I am left with the cats as my subjects!<br><br>
