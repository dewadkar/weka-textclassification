            We bought a fly yellow 2000 Wrangler Sport with black trim, an inline 6, hard and soft tops, and alloy wheels.  We've driven it to Alaska from San Francisco over some knarly roads, and we drive it a lot around town and to the Sierras.  About 10,000 fabulous miles so far.  We bought it because it has character--it's the authentic article--and it's FUN!

Me:  &quot;That's the coolest-looking car on the road!  It's SO fun to drive with its firm suspension and short wheelbase.  I love being able to lose the top or unzip parts of it.&quot;

Her:  &quot;Oh puhlease...  It's squared off with rivets on the body.  It looks like a relic of World War II.  It's bouncy and dodges around on the freeway when the wind blows.  The roofs leak, both of them.  You have to shout to hear people talk on the freeway.&quot;

Me:  &quot;But our kids are crazy about it!  They think we're the coolest parents on the planet.  They always vote for the Jeep when we go places.&quot;

Her:  &quot;But it's a pain to fold those seats forward to get the kids in, and then we don't have room for anything extra.  There's absolutely no room in this thing for luggage or groceries.&quot;

Me:  &quot;Hey this is the best off-road vehicle there is.  Those puffy, fake SUVs like that Honda Passport we had are a joke out there.&quot;

Her:  &quot;It breaks down all the time.  It died and had to call roadside assistance.  It boiled over when the radiator cap was defective.  The heater fan went out, the windshield washer tank leaks, the differential drips.  We've only owned it 7 months!  I'm not taking it out in the middle of nowhere.&quot; 

Me:  &quot;Hey, a guy's gotta have a little fun!&quot;

Her:  &quot;Can't a guy have fun with something that gets more than 15 mpg?&quot;
