            It was in May of this year that I purchased my 1997 Neon, the best impulsive purchase I've ever made.  It was after several grueling months of shopping around and pricing (and the nearly unbearable realization that the Dodge Viper was way out of my price range) that I finally took a salesman's advice.  It was to be the first car that I actually paid for and I wanted it to be something that was dependable, affordable and preferably not a tank.  

He brought me to a little Neon in the front of the lot.  Cute, I thought, but I was almost ready to settle for a comfortable pair of walking shoes when I reluctantly plopped down in the driver's seat to test drive the car. I drove the car about ten miles and observed the pros and cons of my potential vehicle.  Instantaneously, I noticed the tight steering and sensitive brakes.  I also noted that it hugged curves like a champ and provided a very comfortable seat for the smooth ride.  The only con I found was the color of the car, but after the impressive ride I decided that the color was only paint deep and that it's what's inside the hood that really counts *valuable learning experience*. I parked the car back at the dealership and I was sold.  After a thorough overlook of the engine I went inside to start the paperwork.  I drove my new car (that I now lovingly refer to as Bubbles) home that night, pleased as punch:0)

Since then, I've had very minimal work done on the car.  It's all been regular maintenance i.e. oil change, new front tire (the wrath of the evil curb befell upon me) and that's about it.  The engine still purrs like a kitten even in weather below freezing.  It's also taken me on several trips from New Jersey to Atlanta and back with no trouble at all, which in and of itself is impressive.  The gas mileage I get on the car is amazing, which is a definite bonus considering gas prices these days.  

I would definitely recommend this car to anyone as a first automobile or to someone who doesn't know all that much about car maintenance.  It's small, good gas mileage and very affordable.  The car itself is also very light weight, therefor giving it a little more get-up-and-go.  Granted, it's not a V-8 engine, but the Neon can hold it's own.  However, if you are the type of person who enjoys repairing cars and having them frequent the hobby shop or if you're just a plain glutton for punishment, buy a Ford Problem, er, Probe.  I truly feel like I made the right choice, especially for my first car.  Maybe it was luck of the draw or maybe it was a salesman that knew exactly what he was talking about, either way, I'm still proud of my car from the engine to the body condition.  Thanks Dodge!<br><br>
