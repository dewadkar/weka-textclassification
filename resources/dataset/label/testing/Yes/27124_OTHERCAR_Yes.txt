            We traded in a '97 Blazer because we wanted more room.
At $27,000 we landed on a '99 Safari AWD eight-passenger
van.  It is surprisingly stable on the road and a remarkably
quiet ride.  Having owned three other vans, we have found
this one to be superior in interior room.  There is abundant
room for eight passengers and good storage behind rear
seat.  The three-way opening at the back is very convenient
for loading and unloading cargo.  Visibility is great, gas mileage
is 18mpg city, 23mpg highway.  It has a great turning radius
but is some-what rough when the AWD kicks in.  We would
recommend this vehicle to families and anyone looking for 
solid, stable transportation in all-weather conditions.
