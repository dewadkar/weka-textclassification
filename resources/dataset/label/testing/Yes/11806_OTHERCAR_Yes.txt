            Not having quite enough money for the coveted Toyota Tacoma, I purchased my Nissan Frontier new in 1998 and have been fairly satisfied with this choice. Compared to the higher-quality Toyota, the driving the Nissan sometimes resembles driving a toy Tonka truck. It picks up a few more bumps than I'd like, and I would not recommend driving it in snowy weather. However, I do feel safe in this vehicle, and it is easy to drive in normal conditions. My main complaints with the vehicle would be thus: my battery was low quality from the start and gave me problems within the first year and a half; my pop-down seats in the extended part of the cab are coming apart from the plastic piece they are attached to; and maintenance is a problem with a manual that has more than one version of the maintenance log included (all items are not covered, either). I expect my truck to last a long time, and when it finally bites the dust, I'll get a Toyota. The Nissan Frontier is a good (affordable) starter truck and has served me well.
