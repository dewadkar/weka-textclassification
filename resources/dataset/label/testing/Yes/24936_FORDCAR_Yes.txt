            I've drooled over Mustangs since I was 14.  When I bought my first - a 1999 - at the age of 23, my eyes were opened to a new level of automobile ownership.  I live in a small town, and let me tell you, every head turns when I drive this beauty down the street.  

Let me give you a &quot;virtual tour&quot; of my 35th Anniversary Stang.  He (yes, I've decided it's definitely a &quot;he&quot;) is black with an automatic transmission and V-6.  He has a cassette/CD player, power seats, windows, locks and mirrors, an anti-theft system, keyless entry/alarm, and spoiler.  The new angled exterior sets it off from the older style Mustangs and from all other cars, too.  It makes the Stang look very aggressive and sporty.  The interior wraps around the driver so everything is close.  The front seats are comfy and roomy.  

Let me say this, though: THIS IS NOT A FAMILY CAR!!  If you plan on using the back seats regularly, invest in something else.  They are about the same size as every Mustang I have seen - TINY.  The seats themselves aren't too bad, but leg room is virtually nonexistent.  

However, if you are looking for a sharp, head-turning, performance-minded car, look no further.  As far as performance goes, I will say that my automatic lacks a little when starting in first gear, but when it kicks into second, LOOK OUT!!  I have yet to run out of power after hitting second.  I've had mine to about 105 mph and it was still cranking out the power!  And all of this out of a V-6!  

Another point I want to hit on are the standard options - it is loaded with them!  The sticker on mine was around $18,400.  I ended up with it for $16,900.  Not bad when you consider that Cavalier Z28s (4 Cyl!) are in the $17-18,000 range.  It came with the following options: power seat, smoker's package (which I don't use - I don't smoke or permit smoking in my car), keyless entry, and floor mats.  That's it!! The rest was standard:  a/c, tilt, cruise, cass/cd, pw, pl, anti-theft system, alum. wheels.  I have yet to see another car with as many STANDARD options.  I worked at a Chevy/Buick/Jeep dealer for a few years, and nothing in any of those car lines compared.  

I love my Mustang and I know you will, too!!  This is by far the best looking car out there in this price range and the quality is unbeatable!  I hope that my opinions will steer you towards a new Mustang of your own!      <br><br>
