            I had the misfortune of having my compact car vandalized. It went into the shop for four days.

The good news about this? The car rental company put me into a 1999 Lumina! Forest green with plush interior. It took me a couple of minutes, but I began to wonder, &quot;How will I ever give this car up?&quot;

For starters, it has all the amenities ï¿½ automatic transmission, automatic windows, automatic steering, automatic headlights, air conditioning/heating, AM/FM radio, a huge trunk, lots of leg room, etc. etc. Above and beyond all that is an engine that you can hardly hear, and a ride that's as smooth as the engine. It's not as maneuverable as my little compact, but then, you can't have everything.

This vehicle just about drives itself. The driver just goes along for the ride.

Since I rented and did not purchase, I can't speak to the cost. I understand it's about $17,000. That seems very inexpensive to me for the quality of ride you get.

I'd recommend this car to the baby boomer crowd, and/or to anyone who wants luxury without breaking the bank.
