            Have used this camera since June 1999. Have found it to be very easy to use and fast.  We are using it to picture items for sale on eBay and can get through lots of pictures quickly.  This camera takes the standard 3 1/2&quot; disk - your images are recorded here. Transport to your hard drive is really convenient when compared to the other brands.  Just pop in your disk and &quot;File Open&quot; - no wires to hook up. This feature alone should make your choice simple - Sony. We have seen other users struggle with memory problems and problems moving one image at a time to their PC - I move the entire disk full to my PC.  Also, pleased with the battery service.  I use it only on battery.  Have take several thousand pictures since last summer - original battery still going strong.  Paid a littl more for this one, but worth it. Good luck with your eBay selling or creating your digital photo library - this camera really has made it easy for me.      <br><br>
