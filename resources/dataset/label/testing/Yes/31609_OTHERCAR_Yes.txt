            When my mother asked me to research and buy a digital camera for her work, I had no idea what I was getting into.  I did a bit of research and decided on the CP 800.  I bought it, and played with it for a little bit so I could show them how to use it.  After a week with it, I was so impressed I was reluctant to give it up.  So I bought myself one.  Then a friend bought one at my advice, as did another.  They did so after using mine for a few hours, and I know they couldn't be happier with their purchases.

The camera is extremely simple to use.  The interface is quick and easy to navigate - if you ever need to.  You can open the box, put the batteries and the memory in, and just start using it.  It's so easy.

The quality of the pictures is excellent.  With a maximum resolution of 1600x1200, you can print 8x10 if you're not entering any photo contests or picking nits with a magnifying glass.  The other resolution is 640x480, which is more than enough for use on web pages.  An in between resolution would have been a very nice feature to add, since there are times I've wanted better than VGA, but not enough memory for more than a few at 1600x1200.

Two things you'll want to get (and this goes for just about any digital camera) are a bigger memory card, and a USB reader.  The 8meg is nice, but you need more if you plan on really using this (or any camera).  While the serial port connection is easy to setup and functional, it's unbearable slow, so a USB reader is necessary if you have a bigger memory card or plan on using the camera a lot.  Let me make that three things.  Regular batteries just don't cut it.  I got a charger and some rechargeables, and there's just no comparison - they last MUCH longer.

The LCD display is one of the best parts of the camera.  You know exactly what you're getting with it.  The colors and exposure are accurate.  The only times I've had problems using it were in bright conditions, where the ambient light overpowers the display, making it hard to see.  

One of my biggest gripes, and I understand it's an issue in most digital cameras, is the delay between hitting the button, and the picture being taken.  I tried taking some pictures of runners in a marathon.  The first few all I would get are the back of the person leaving the frame.  Since the LCD goes black once you hit the shutter button, it can be hard to follow the runner and keep them in the frame.  I got used to it, and some shots came out very well, but I think digital cameras are just not ready for timing critical applications.

In this price range, I wouldn't buy any other digital camera.
