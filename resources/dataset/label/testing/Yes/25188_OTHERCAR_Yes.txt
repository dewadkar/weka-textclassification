            As a new father in a relatively new job, it was not an easy task to find a new car that I would be happy with and be able to AFFORD at the same time. Not having the luxury of time made the process even harder. Given my price range of (In Canadian Dollars) $15,000 to $19,000, my choices of quality options were limited. 
After looking at both the Protoge and the Corolla, my choice was easier to make once I test drove both. I enjoyed driving the Protoge in a way I could not appreciate the Corolla. My 5-speed manual transmission shifted so smoothly and cleanly that I was able to get the state of not thinking about my shifting very quickly, after not having driven a standard in a few years. The Clutch was extremely forgiving, and the steering smooth and  pleasant. 

I picked up a two options, namely A/C and ABS brakes, both of which I highly recommend. If you are comfortable driving a standard get the A/C instead of the automatic transmission, as I found the trade more than equitable during those hotter summer months. 

The shocks on the Protoge found that balance between tight and spongy so that you can feel the road and yet not regret the fact. 

For pure entertainment value the Protege stacks up even better. The standard CD/AM/FM sound system lifts this car to the top of it's class for value. The Speakers put out a pleasant sound, good for your loud rock, or for the baby's lullaby CD's on those nights only a car ride will get him to sleep.

What I particularly liked was how they thought of the small things. From the Coin and cup holders to the driver and passenger vanity mirrors.

One thing to note. As a 6'5" man, I was not able to comfortable fit myself into the Corolla. the Protoge however was a completely other story. The tilt steering, slightly higher head space and better designed driver's consoles allowed me not only to fit, but to be able to drive for long stretches in comfort even without cruise control. 

And of course the most attractive thing about this car is the price. My price tag of 18,000(Canadian) Meant that my lease payments were smaller and managable. 

The thing I would wish to add would be VARIABLE speed intermittant wipers. While the one speed intermittant wipers do the job, I often experience situations where Variable speed would be preferred.

The last comment I have about it's Cons is the fact that it could be a slight bit quieter on the highway. It allows a fair bit of a noise in. Not enough to detract from it, but enough to raise your voice over.

************UPDATE****************

As of February 28th, I had 3 minor accidents within 2 weeks of each other. One was my fault, one was the other persons (Both Fender benders The third I was run off the road in a blizzard. In all cases my car took virtually no damage...just scrapes to my fender and a loosened wheel well cover. In one case, where I hit a Honda civic of the same year, the Honda's bumper cracked, while mine only was scraped. Becuase of this I now raise my safety opinion of the car. The bits that are important to safety don't break under little provocation. Becuase of this it is doubtful to see me in a Honda in the next 10 years.
