            I purchased this vehicle because I was going to drive to Alaska and I didn't think my old car, a 1988 Toyota Camry, would make the trip.  I was quite impressed with my Toyota's performance, and I loved the reliability, so I decided to try and purchase another one.  I knew that a new car was out of my price range, and I figured the Camry was too expensive also.

  I decided to try out a late model Toyota Corolla.  I test drove a '97 with all of the whistles and bells (power all, dual bags, spoiler, sun roof) and I decided I liked it.  After doing a little research, I found out that not only were the Toyota Corolla and the Chevy Prizm similar, they were even made in the same plant, exactly the same except for colors, interior designing, and stereo, other than that I was told they were the same car.  

  I then test drove a '98 Prizm LSI with power everything, upgraded stereo, dual bags, no spolier, no sun roof.  It was the same exact car for me, no difference besides the cosmetics.  The Corolla had 42,000 miles on it and the Prizm had 29,000.  The Corolla was 11K+ and the Prizm was an even 10K (10500 after Tax Tags, Title).  For me it was no contest, I purchased the Prizm and it took me and my wife all the way from Texas to Alaska with absolutely no problems.  
  
  On the trip I got about 30 mpg, but up here in Alaska with studded snow tires I am down around 25 for city driving, the car also handles quite well on the ice and snow up here.  I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing this vehicle, and I will recommend it to anyone. The interior is laid out perfectly, with everything with in easy reach,  the ride is quiet except when I need to floor it on the highway, but that is it.  

   The trunk is huge and if you need more space the rear seats fold down, the only problem with them is that the only way to release them is in the trunk. The vehicle lags somewhat when the trunk is loaded up with groceries and there are extra passengers, but what do you expect from a 1.8L 4 cyl. engine.  When only my wife and I are in the car the acceleration is brisk and quiet.  I am 6' 1&quot; and the only gripe I have is when someone needs to sit behind me I have to put my seat up uncomfortably far, but when that is the case, I just get my wife to drive and the situation is taken care of.  

   For its price this car will be an instant hit for anyone who has a small family, or is single.  I don't think this car would be acceptable for anyone with more than three people in their family, but if you have any question, just test drive one yourself.<br><br>
