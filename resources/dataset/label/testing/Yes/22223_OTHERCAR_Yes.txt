            <b>Summary: <b>

I drove a new 3.0 Z3 from LA to North Carolina this past weekend and wanted to share some of my impressions. My first impression was of the agressive appearance of the car. This one has the sports package with its larger and more performance-oriented wheels (relative to the 2.5) and tires (relative to the non-sports models). It also had the luxury package, which amounts to heated seats, mirrors and washer jets and some fancier interior trim. The tires and flared fenders definitely suggest performance and the car lived up to the promise. Especially nice is the low end torque. This makes it very easy to pass or move through traffic without a lot of commotion. In at least one situation, I was potentially saved from a violation during a passing maneuver (woops, there's a state police car on the side of the road!) by the fact that I hadn't downshifted, wasn't creating a lot of commotion and my rate of speed didn't seem that out of line with the rest of the traffic. Had I been going the same speed with another 1500 RPM on the tach, I suspect the officer and I would have gotten better acquainted.
I've driven performance cars virtually my whole adult life, ranging from a '72 Datsun 240-Z to a third generation RX-7. The latter still wins as the most fun car I've owned, but the BMW is a strong second and may end up in first place over time. ALthough I avoided high-RPM gymnastics in deference to the newness of the car, I clearly recognized its potential as a fine performer and handler. The turning radius is surprisingly tight. Clutch and brakes are progressive and predictable. Driven at some safe distance from the limits of traction, it handled predictably and controllably. I senses that it could have been pushed much harder and would not have misbehaved. Over rough pavement, cowl shake was noticeable but not excessive and the car felt fairly rigid overall, but not like a fixed-top vehicle.

Another surprise was the snugness of the top. Temperatures were in the low teens at times and at highway speeds, there was not a draft to be found in the cabin. The electric seats worked very well, which is a good thing, because the heater took some fiddling around with to get it producing consistent airflow at the desired temperature. In fairness, though, the temperature variations between the bright sunlight and shady areas was considerable, so the heater had a lot to put up with.

A couple of gripes I've seen in other reviews bear mentioning. One is the plastic window. ALthough I would prefer glass, I understand why it isn't there. First, the window must fold to be stowed. Second, the excellent visibility is achieved by having the rear window wrap around to the sides a bit. A rigid pane of that shape would not stow very conveniently. Thus far, at least, I consider the greater viewing area an acceptable reason for the plastic. I might change my mind if the thing statrs becoming impossible to see through down the road. The other gripe worth addressing is the sound system. I'd heard bad things. Now, this was all top-up driving but I found the Harmon Kardon sound system (with in-dash CD) to work admirably. I listened to a variety of music (excluding rap by choioce and heavy rock by availability) including jazz, classical, oldies, contemporary rock, and folk and all came through clean and clear. If anything, I felt the "flat" setting for the tone controls de-emphasized midrange and boosted treble and bass, but the settings are adjustable. 

I've also read that the seats get a bit uncomfortable after a couple of hours and I concur. I haven't ridden in too many sports cars where this isn't the case. Lateral support was excellent. The cold weather and new leather made sliding forward in the seat a bit easier than I'd prefer but not to the extent of it being a problem.

I got the car virtually at dealer invoice because there was a factory sales incentive to move them off those cold New England lots. At that price, I regard the car as an excellent value. It was comparable in cost to Honda S2000s, which are still commanding prices above MSRP. The latter are also fine cars but need to be worked at very high revs for maximum performance and suffer badly in the torque department. I personally prefer a bigger, less extremely tuned engine that relies on torque rather than revs, but that's strictly a personal preference and the Hondas, by all reports, are wonderful cars. They are a bit thin on creature comforts, though, and those are more important to me than they once were.

For someone looking for an open vehicle that is clearly oriented to performance but that also provides a reasonable level of creature comfort, I'd strongly encourage a careful look at the BMW. Frankly, I would have preferred a coupe to a roadster if it were not for the fact that the Z3 coupe is, in my estimation, one of the least attractive designs ever conceived. It looks like a case of "Honey, I shrunk the station wagon." But the top on the roadster (even without the removable hardtop which I think will prove superfluous for most drivers) is very tight, indeed, and it's easy to forget that there's only cloth above your head.
