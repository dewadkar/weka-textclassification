            I have a 1995 Chevrolet S-10 with the SuperSport (SS) package.  I have it for five years and 91,000 miles.  In those five years, I have made the following observations:

1.)  It's useless in the snow.  With a 190HP Vortec V6 and no weight on the drive wheels (posi-rear), I spin the tires in the snow, rain, loose gravel, and whenever else I try moderate acceleration.

2.)  I am officially a member of the GM Recall-of-the-Month Club.  Pretty safe to say that the dealerships ask me which recall I have when I show up.  Seems there are so many, they can't keep them straight.

3.)  Initial quality was sketchy.  I had intermittent problems that took a long time and four dealerships to resolve.  Since then, knock wood, no issues except normal wear and tear.

4.)  The truck eats wear parts for dinner.  New front end and exhaust system before 70k miles.  Tires don't stay balanced because they're always spinning, alignment virtually always off.  (The guy at the shop says his is the same way.)

5.)  Now for the good stuff.  Truck is as fast as you &quot;need&quot;.  I have done ~110mph and it is smooth and actually handles the speed very well.  It looks great.  I had at least a dozen offers for it without even a &quot;for sale&quot; sign.  One reviewer said it was small and uncomfortable, but I'm 6'2&quot; and 200lbs and I have not noticed.  I have hauled well over 500lbs of fire wood in the 6' bed, and it performed admirably.  Certainly not going to use it on a job site, but definitely for the 2x4's at Home Depot.

I love my truck.  I think it's a pretty good buy.  I paid $14,300 for it in 1995 and it was loaded.  Considering a crappy little Toyota or Hyundai will cost the same or more for a four-cylinder, econo-box, the S-10 is worth looking at.<br><br>
