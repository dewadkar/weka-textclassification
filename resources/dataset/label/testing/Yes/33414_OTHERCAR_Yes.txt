            I bought this car because I just joined the Marines and needed reliable transportation. I decided to buy it for several reasons. The first reason was because im into car clubs and stuff and they are very upgradable. If you want a preformance part for it you can find it. I mean everything. the car is a very good deal for the price, but i would definently pay the extra thousand and get the VR6. It has quite a bit more power. The car gets decent gas mileage and has alot of safety features not always found in similiar mid-size cars. The gas mileage is good and so is the ride. I love it and would highly reccomend this car.<br><br>
