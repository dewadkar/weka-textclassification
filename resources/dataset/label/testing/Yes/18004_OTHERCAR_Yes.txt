            I own a 1993 Saturn SL1. It's a great little car. In our part of the country, it only takes $8-10.00 to fill up the tank. A tank of gas seems to last for ever. I bought this car used and have had no major problems with it in the year I've had it.We owned a Saturn Wagon in 1995, We loved it, but traded it in on a truck. We missed our little car so much we went and got another one. 

The only downfall to my &quot;Little&quot; car is we are a family of 5 now, and it gets kind of cramped.We will be trading this one in on a New full sized Saturn. It's great for traveling, it sure has the &quot;go go&quot; power. My car has over 110,000 miles on it and is still running strong. It's a great car. Also Saturn is a great company to buy from. They actually do like on the commercial and sing and clap when you buy your car. They don't try to haggel you, or feed you any line of bull. The people we delt with were sinceare and straight forward. To this day we are very pleased with the overall service we have recieved from this company. <br><br>
