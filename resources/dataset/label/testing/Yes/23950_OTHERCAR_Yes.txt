            <b>The Holy Grail. - Size Matters. </b>

This is my first digital camera. Before I purchased this camera I used a 35mm SLR camera to take pictures.  It creates high quality photos but is very bulky to carry around.  To me, the holy grail would be a tiny camera that takes awesome photos.  The smaller the better.  There is no such thing as small enough.  However, it needs to be ergonomically designed. I use my camera to take family snapshots, but I am picky about the quality of the photos.  The Coolpix 3100 is small and takes quality photos. 

<b>Focusing</b>

I tried 35mm compact cameras but they do not take good photos because they do not focus through the lens (TTL).  Current 35mm SLR cameras focus by sharpening a high contrast area it sees TTL.  Good digital cameras focus that way too (incl the coolpix 3100).  Thus, digital cameras are able to focus better than compact 35mm cameras.

<b>Exposure Options and Manual overides</b>

The professional reviewers tend to get all excited about exposure options and manual overides(that is why they love the Canon A70).  This camera does not have a lot of manual overides, but manual overides are very low on my list of requirements for a digital camera.  The best thing for me would be a camera with one button that always knew the best exposure.  The Nikon does have some neet scene options but, not as many features as the A70.  One option that I use a lot is the sport mode because it continuously focuses which reduces the shutter delay.  One bad thing about exposure is that the camera switches to ISO 400 in low light (even with flash) this makes the image grainy.  Nikon should update their software to allow an overide to this function.(hint hint)

<b>Shutter Lag</b>

Be carefull listening to the Best Buy salespeople.  They said the shutter lag was horrible on the Nikon.  However, I tested it compared to the Canon and it was faster in all conditions.  There is some lag, but if you put the camera into the continuous focus mode (sport) there is almost no lag.

<b>Ergonomics</b>

The Nikon blows other cameras away in this category.  The camera is very small but, it has a nice bump on the right side which allows you to grip the camera well.  The on-off switch is twisty thing around the shutter button.  It is very easy to operate but impossible to be accidentally activated in your pocket.  The zoom is under your thumb (perfect).  The buttons to navigate the menus are great.  Especially the one touch view images button.  The canon Elph and Canon A70 are much more awkward in the ergonomic category.

<b>Battery life</b>

Duh, goes through batteries quickly.  A stupid comment by other reviewers.  Compared to what?  All digital cameras go through batteries quickly.  This camera only holds two AA batteries compared to the A70 which holds four.  However, it does not go through batteries twice as quickly as the A70.  Three different Best Buy stores told me the 3100 would only take 35 photos on a set of batteries. (they must be trained by canon) I get about 100-120 photos on a set of batteries (some with flash).  However, I turn the cammera off between photos.  The great thing about two batteries is it is easy to carry a spare set around.  Easier than carrying 4 spare batteries around.  Think about the space required to carry the A70 with four spare batteries compared with the 3100 with two spare batteries (about half the space I would say).  

<b>Image Quality</b>

The first time I used the camera I took my kids to Disneyland/LA for a week.  I took about 350 photos and kept about 150.  A digital camera changes the way you take photos.  You take more photos, throw away more photos, but end up with more good photos.  I had the images developed by online photo developers (i will be writing a comparison of 5 of them soon) and the quality was awesome.  I can't imagine ever using my 35mm camera again.  Another good source for developing is Target 29cent/pic or Costco 19cents/pic.  You just hand them your memory card and they copy the photos off of it.  You can even program how many copies of each image you want onto the memory card(directly from the camera).  I don't have any actual images to compare, but from what I have read, the photos from the Nikon are sharper than the photos from the Canon. (typical of 35mm Nikon vs Canon.  Canon = Features, Nikon = Less Features, Better photos)

<b>Image Control</b>

Digital images can be cropped, red eye removed and exposure corrected (a bit) on your computer.  I love that.  (A good free program is the free snapfish editing program.  The Nikon view software that comes with the camera is crap.

<b>Memory Card</b>

Yes the card that comes with the camera is useless.  I purchased a 256MB card on sale at best buy for $79.  You can get them online for less.  I purchased the Sandisk "Ultra" because some of the larger cheaper cards are slow.  This card can hold about 200 photos of the highest quality setting on the camera.

<b>Batteries</b>

I purchased a set of 4 Panasonic 1950mah Nimh AA batteries with charger at Wolf camera for $25.  A bargain compared to the $40 1700 mah batteries that Best Buy sells.

<b>Final Note</b>

Yes, I love this camera.  It is tiny and takes great pictures.  You probably notice that most digital cameras get great reviews.  That is because they are incredible pieces of technology.  The current price/performance point for digital cameras is amazing.  In general I would stick to cameras made by camera companies.  For me, this is an almost perfect camera.  Tiny (my wife carries it in her small purse with two spare batteries), great ergonomics, great photo quality.  Plus I can crop, fix red eye , and exposure on my computer.  I did not give it 5 stars because it has more than one button and cannot read my mind.

Total Price (Camera, Batteries, Mem Card) $455 plus tax
