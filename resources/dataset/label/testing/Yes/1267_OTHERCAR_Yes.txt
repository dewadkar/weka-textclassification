            	Nikon's 990 model is the successor to the extreamly popular 950 and has a 3.34 megapixel sensor, with a maximum image size of 2048 x 1536. The camera can take 2 frames per second at full resolution, or 40 seconds of QVGA Motion-JPEG at 15 frames per second in its movie mode.The 990 has a 50-step manual focus, and four exposure modes: automatic, shutter priority, aperture priority and full manual. It also provides auto bracketing in 5 steps. Its lens is a nine-element 3x Zoom lens (a 38-115 in 35mm equivalency). that accepts optional Coolpix add-on lenses such as a fish-eye. The new CoolPix uses CompactFlash storage, and has a 1.8-inch LCD. It has a 5-mode flash, USB and serial jacks, and TV video output. With a magnesium chassis, the camera weighs 13.1 oz. It measures 5.9 inches wide x3.1 H x 1.5 D.

	As an owner of the 950 and a soon to be owner of the 990, I can without a doubt recommend this camera to anyone wanting to get into digital photography with a high end consumer model camera.<br><br>
