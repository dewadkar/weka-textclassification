            Purchased my 2nd digital camera, the S100.  I also have the S10 that I enjoyed very much until Canon announced the smaller S100. 
The camera has well built stainless steel body and is easily carried in your pocket. 
One of the short commings I have found with digital cameras is that the shutter is not responsive enough for me.  The camera has to &quot;think&quot; before it decides to operate, unlike my 35mm Nikon. 
Digital photography is great for immediate viewing and sharing with the family and friends over the internet.
I am really happy with the camera's small size and have recommended this one too.<br><br>
