            After the birth of my son, I needed to get rid of my trusty but cramped coupe and get a sedan with room for the diaper bag. Lured by the low financing offers flooding the market, I set my sights on a 2002 Nissan Altima. That dream ended when the tester I was driving stalled in the dealership lot (it was an automatic). I turned to Mazda, which at the time was offering 0 percent on all 2001 and 2002s. Our choice came down to a base 2002 626 or the dealer's last 2001, an ES-V6 with automatic transmission, leather, moonroof, Bose CD and 16-inch alloys. Naturally, I bought the 2001. 
When it comes to roadability, the ES-V6 handles well. The automatic gearbox is fairly smooth though it sometimes sounds as if it is hesitant to shift when coming up to highway speed. Steering is very smooth and braking is adequate (my car is not equipped with ABS, which is an option). There is no mistaking the V6 under the hood, though I'm sure it is be more fun paired with the available 5-speed.
The interior styling of the 626 is quite comfortable. The leather seats, though not heated, are very supportive. Controls are very easy to operate, but sometimes awkward for those of us with shorter arms to reach. Cruise control buttons are mounted on the steering wheel, but there is no indicator light to tell you if the system is on. As in the Toyota Camry, the cupholders are mounted just behind the gear selector and in front of the center armrest, which has a built in power plug and CD case. The rear defrost switch is somewhat obscured by the steering wheel, something Mazda is reportedly addressing. As for noise levels, don't expect Camry quietness. While not loud by any means, the 626 always lets you know it running.
Exterior styling is very smooth. The 16-inch alloys give the car a bit of an aggressive stance. It's not Altima-like styling, but it's nice nonetheless.
I have had to take the car in once since I purchased it. A piece of door trim was installed incorrectly and ended up bending another piece of door trim. The dealer replaced both pieces under the warranty.
