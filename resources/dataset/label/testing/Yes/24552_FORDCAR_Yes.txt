            I, like some other Epinion writers, owned a Dodge Dakota before picking up a used 1997 Ford F-150. So far I have been satisfied with the trucks performance.

It's a 1997 Ford F-150 XL with the 4.6 V6, Automatic, A/C, Tape Deck, Split Bench Seat, Sliding Rear Window, Short Box, Regular Cab, with metallic blue over a grey lower portion. Two-wheel drive. The floor is vinyl with no carpet.

Pros: The truck has excellent visibility, even in the two-wheel drive model. The height difference between my little Dodge and the Ford was more than what I expected. The interior of the truck is simple, useful and spacious. This is the first vehicle I have owned where I don't have to put the seat back to the last notch in order to comfortably drive it. The vehicle is equipped with dual airbags and features a shut-off control for the passenger unit.

I use the truck for light hauling, mainly and expeditions into the local junk yards. When serving this duty, the truck has performed like champ. It's agile enough to traverse some of the nastiest junk yard ruts that I have seen, yet sophisticated enough to handle pretty much like a large car on the highway. The good-sized 16 inch tires put the truck high enough to avoid most road hazzards.

In a downpour, the wipers are just fast enough and the lights are bright enough with plenty of left to right illumination so you can see what ever critter might be planning on a kamakazie mission into your path. One thing that my passengers like is the grab handle located on the A-pillar. All vehicles should have these. The interior is so expansive there just isn't anything for the passenger to grab on to when the going gets rough so the handle is a great idea.

Mileage varies on gas quality and the nature of the driving. A steady 55-60 MPH pace on the open road will net you 21 miles to the gallon. Normal mixed city/highway use puts us lower at 19 MPG. On a recent rip we fit a full-size suitcase BEHIND the seat, and this is a regular cab pickup.

Maintenance is a breeze. Everything is out in the open and you don't have to jack up the vehicle to change the oil. The oil filter is out in the open, yet protected by the frame. The entire undercarriage of the vehicle is rock-solid.

The V6 has enough power for every-day use but it sure isn't a rocket ship. Passing is comfortable and if you put your foot into it she'll take you where you want to go in a hurry. Although, my next truck will have a V8.

This is the best selling vehicle in the United States, period. Nothing out-sells a Ford F-150. That means parts are plentiful and insurance is pretty cheap.

Cons: There a couple things I don't like about the truck. The sheet metal on this vehicle is paper thin. My tailgate weights about a ton but the slightest pressure to the metal bows it in and I have put a dent in it by closing the gate with my knee, something I did a thousand times with the Dakota with no ill effect.

The paint shows every little scratch that you get in it.

The biggest problem I have had with this vehicle is the rear window would leak in a severe fashion when it rained. A couple of trips to the deal won me a new, tinted, sliding window so all was well in the end but the truck did develop a slightly musty smell that has yet to go away. The jack was also rusted up since it sits under the seat. 

The truck does have some mystery sounds, like a fairly good clunk in the rear end when it comes to a stop. It also has a noisy A/C unit under the hood, something you don't notice with the windows up. I'm not worried about either of these simply because I have owned other vehicles in the past that make this one sound as quiet as a Cadillac.<br><br>
