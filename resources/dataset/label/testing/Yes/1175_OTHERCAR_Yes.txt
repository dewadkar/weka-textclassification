                 The Dodge 2000 Neon is a near-impeccable improvement from those of previous years. I had previously owned a 95 Neon, and within a year, we experienced MUCH break trouble and a broken valve causing overheating. In contrast, the 2000 Neon has neither had any problems or shown any hint of problems in the time I've had it. The 2000 Neon's small, compact build, dual airbags, great sound insulation and affordable price make it ideal for a single person or college student. As my first personal car, I have found it to be perfect. Unfortunately, for larger families or those needing more space, the Neon would not be appropriate.<br><br>
