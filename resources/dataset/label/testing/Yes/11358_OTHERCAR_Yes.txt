            We bought ours in May of 2000 when it was a year old. We got it from a local van rental agency that specializes in renting vans for trips to Southeastern Conference football games. This van had 46,600+ miles on it, and it just turned over 98,000. It had been extremely well-maintained, to the point that my mechanic, when checking it over before I bought it, said he couldn't find a thing wrong with it and considered it as good as new.

This van has been extremely reliable. Other than routine maintenance, I've only had it in the shop twice, both times for speed sensor problems. 

We do a lot of DYI around the house, and with the removable rear bench seat and two intermediate captain's chairs, we can stack 4x8 sheets of drywall or plywood. You can't do that in an Odyssey, I'm told. I've been able to carry lumber as long as 10' inside, by reclining the front passenger seat. That open space is also great for taking big loads to the dump or to the recycling center.

Comfort is a big plus with this van. It's great on trips with both big and small people. We have two children in college and a third one that's 13. Everybody can find a good seat, and the rear air keeps even the bench seat  comfortable. The sunscreen glass also allows our 13-year-old to change on the fly in privacy into baseball or football gear.

If I could just find some long-wearing tires, my satisfaction would be total. The current Kelly Navigators have 35,000 miles on them, one of them being close to worn out, and this on tires that are supposed to approach 60,000 miles of treadwear.
