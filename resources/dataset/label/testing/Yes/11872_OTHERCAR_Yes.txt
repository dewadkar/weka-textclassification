            Italian style with Detroit ala carte, this semi exotic is a lot of fun when it runs. Like a lot of Italian cars, it looks great but often doesnï¿½t hold up in the reliability department. Even low mileage Allantes are tormented with abs brake, electrical, and convertible top problems. Considering the cost of the car, one would expect a power top and heated seats. On the up side, people are now making a hefty profit by buying "Parts Cars" to provide for declining parts availability. I saw a wealthy celebrity whimper over repair costs. New shocks/struts $975, windshield $500, and eventually you'll probably need abs brakes $2000. Dealers no longer train techs to repair Allantes, so work is often hit & miss. Allante owners are a very tight group, happy to share info in various websites. In fact, I found this website when I was searching the internet for parts for my "89". Ultimately, this is a nice "2nd" car. In most cases, I think it would be a major mistake to have this car be your one and only. The problem is, this lady has a wandering eye for mechanics and auto parts stores.
