            So Car & Driver started raving around mid-1994, anticipating the "new M3" would be a remarkable mix of high performance, practicality, and reasonable price.  I wasn't even in the market for a car, but it just sounded great.  In the fall I found a dealer with a demo car (an hour and a half away), and was just smitten.  In love, but not wanting to get gouged, I bought a spot 9 months out on the waiting list (for a late-model-year 1995) at $3K under list.

When it finally arrived, it was athletic and beautiful.  I went 1000 miles the first week, and ended up quietly raving to the extent that several friends bought one the next year.

Since then I've put about 55K miles on it (no serious commute), but can honestly say I consciously enjoy the car nearly every time I'm in it.  It just moves exactly like you'd like it to.  Every non-exotic car I drive seems imprecise by comparison, including many that are supposed to be great.

Here is the complete list of my negative observations:
* it's low, and takes a little attention to not scrub the front or middle on abrupt driveway transitions.
* the 1995 model (alone) doesn't have traction control, so I've popped the back end out in the rain (or a flooded roadway) by unconsciously being deeper into the accelerator than I realized.  By the way, in the course of some crazy fast runs on isolated backroads, I've never experienced the snap oversteer some have reported here.
* rear tires have never lasted more than about 15K miles.
* the stereo is no better than OK

After 6 years, I still love it, and someday I'll get the newer, more spacious, faster model.  My one warning: because of it's enthusiasm and precision, you may end up driving around thinking that people are especially slow and inattentive in their lesser cars.  Your M3 will be great fun, but will not inspire calm and tranquility.
