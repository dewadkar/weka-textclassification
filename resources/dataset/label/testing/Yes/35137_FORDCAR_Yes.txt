            I have owned 4 Escorts, and have been very happy with all of them. You have to understand the Escort is a compact car, so you will not get unbelievable power or a cadillac-ride. But if your looking for the best-riding, roomiest, dependable, maintenance-free, and reasonably priced sub-compact, then the Escort is for you!! My current escort is only 10 months old, and I have over 45,000 miles on it. I deliver newspapers, and spend over 4 hours a day in my Escort. I find that the car is very comfortable, maneuverable, and cost-efficient. I drive everyday rain, snow, or shine, and I am very confident that my Escort will get me through my day safely! All my escorts have been pretty much maintenance-free, just change the oil, tires, brakes, and fluids. 

I have a son, so I'm moving him in and out of the car during the day. I find that the escort is a very roomy car for a compact, there is more than enough room for the the standard 5 person family. To sum it up, if your looking for the best compact car for the money, then you need to try the Escort!!<br><br>
