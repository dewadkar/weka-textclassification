            Yesterday my Ply. voyager died. 165,000 miles.I had been so dissatisfied with the dealers repairs to the transmission, that I vowed never to purchase another one.  So when GM sent me an invitation to the Showroom in Motion, I jumped at the change.
I was treated to all the most popular mini vans on the market.  Each competitor had their best to show and I drove them all...like a bat out of hell.  In the end the Montana won my $$$$.
Control:  First I demonstrated it's manuverability by doing a full 360 with finishing w/ backing into Parking space, on the move. no problem.  Over the ruff- it was a bit bouncy, but did well enough. I like it because it wasn't soft and mushy. On all the turns it held tight with little side to side sway.
HIGH SPEED BRAKING:  Excellent- as soon as I came out of the &quot;s&quot; turns I floored it. About 1/2 way through the stdraight I actually stomped the brake and waited for the rear to pull loose. Nothing. A straight hammer on stop from about 55mph. excellent handling during the force stop.
SEATING: For most woman with wide hips the seats feel a bit snug, but that is forgotten by the comfortable lumbar ajustments. I think the material used for both the seats and floor coverings is not as good as the caravans and should be improved esp. for the price.  Changing the seat is easy, once you get the hang of it and storing them made simple. You can stack them either one top of one another or side by side, but his will deminish the integrity of the seats.
CARGO:  Once you have removed all the seats,I don't like the way the rear  cargo area, directly inside the lift gate, is narrow compaired to the front cargo area behind the drivers seat.
