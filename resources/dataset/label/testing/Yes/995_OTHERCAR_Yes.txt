            First of all, this is my first brand new car, and was well worth the wait.  We got the 2003 Toyota Matrix base model with the extra mile package, power windows/locks, key less entry, and VIN etching.  It comes stock with CD player. 

Features:
CD player
Latch system (for child safety seats)
Bucket seats w/ center console
(2) 12-volt outlets (one hidden in center console)
(4) cup holders (2 front & 2 rear)
Full size spare

This car is considered a sport wagon.  It has a lot of cargo space especially if you fold down the rear seat, and front passenger seat.  They both lay flush with the far rear compartment enabling you to haul large bulky items.

I absolutely love this car.  Considering I was driving something very untrustworthy, having a new car is wonderful.  I have had no problems with it except a compartment in the front wouldn't stay closed after a couple weeks.  When I got my oil changed for the first time they fixed it and I've had no problems with it since.  As I said, this car is very versatile.  I have already put almost 14k miles on it and have had it for less than 6 months.  I have used it to move, and it holds a lot of stuff.  It gets good gas mileage...around 28-32 mpg depending on how you drive it.  It's great for grocery shopping because stuff doesn't have to go in the rear seat with my 3 year old, it goes in the far back which is high enough where it's easy to unload.  

There's not much negative I can say about the actual car except it doesn't have much engine power, and my husband says it's an uncomfortable ride for someone who is tall.  (His legs rub against the side piece of the center of the dash when he drives.)  For someone small it is very comfortable.  I do wish my model had the adjustable lumbar support, but it's not that big of a deal.
