            I bought this vehicle because I liked the size and handling characteristics of mini-vans.  The windstar has a six cylinder engine that is needed for adequate power.  The smaller engine would be a mistake.  The minivan handles like a car, but has the carrying of a van.  I remove the back seat and use only the four captains chairs.  That compensates for the small space behind the bench seat.  It would have been better had Ford designed the rear seat to install in place of the two captains seats.  Overall I would purchase the car again, the best recommendation possible. The drivers seat sits up higher than a passenger car, thereby providing excellent view of the road.  The blind spot is small, but the addition of a small convex mirror to the drivers side mirror overcomes the minor problem.<br><br>
