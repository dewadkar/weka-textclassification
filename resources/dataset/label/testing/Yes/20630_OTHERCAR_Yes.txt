            A product by Creative Labs .

I have stated that I paid $149.99 for this. I am in the UK and payed a very cheap price for it. So i found the American equivilant of a cheap price which it is going on offer for. (Not very good when it comes to currency converting!) 

I purchased this camera early 2002. It comes nicely packaged.

It has an included memory size of 16 MB, which is built, with a resolution of 0.78 megapixels. 


This camera is extremely easy to install, and even has web cam ability! It comes with a nice stand also. It also acts as a low quiality cam corder, and allows you to take short clips. I advise that you make sure that you use this feature sparingly however - in my opinion this drains the batteries significantly. 

Once photographs are take,they are compressed as JPEG images. Once the software is installed, it is easy to use and shows previews of the images you have taken, along with any audio or video clips. Yes, this also has ability to record just sound, as well as sound and video. 

It utilizes 4 AAA alkaline batteries, but once plugged in to the PC, uses the power from the PC. Good quality batteries in this camera last a long time! Cheaper batteries, obviously do not.

It comfortable and easy to hold, as well as use. You can turn the flash off, or on, and all the usual features you get with a camera. Apart from the fact you don't have to wind it on or use film!  

The image quality varies depending on the lighting. Some pictures appear grainy, some crystal clear. You have to just learn to understand in what circumstances it takes the best images. After pressing the "snap" button, it takes a few seconds to actually process the shot. I have many a time pressed "snap" and moved the camera and ended up with a blurred shot. 

The only problem with this I have had is that the flap that keeps the batteries in has snapped! However masking tape helps me stick it back in place.

Cheap and friendly to use! A good buy if you are on a budget.
