            The first time I saw the Audi TT on the internet I fell in love with its looks right away.  Finally here is a car that has shirked the conventional boring designs that plague our roads today.  I just get so tired of all the American and Japanese look alike cars that have a low level of creativity in their design.  With the TT Audi has smashed these ideas and come up with a very competent sports car.  With either trim level this car is quite satisfying, however if one has the resources they should step up to the Quattro model with the 225 hp motor.  

The fit and finish of this car is exceptional and remains true to Audi form by solid as Fort Knox.  It's interior is very sports car like with very primal braces and things left showing.  There is a support from the dash that reaches the floor that is in the brushed aluminum that takes you back to older sports cars.  This car is truly nostalgic while still being tasteful.  Even with the 185 hp trim level acceleration is excellent and the motor is smooth.  There is minimal turbo lag.  Audi's legendary Quattro system makes this car a fierce competitor for BMW and Mercedes (especially in Seattle) and blows away the Honda and Mazda drop tops.  The selection of colors available for this car is great and has a selection of two different types of rims.  

The car has limited cargo space, just enough for a weekender for two.  An infant car seat may fit in the back seat.  Visibility is also limited in this car for non aggressive drivers.  They may find the rear posts to be intimidating when changing lanes and parallel parking.  However, amenities such as brushed aluminum rings around the guages and climate control vents and a golf ball style shifter may smooth those objections away.  The car has a great deal of storage compartments for maps, cds, etc.  Without question the car is a head turner where every you take it.  

With an Z3 or SLK costing thousands more Audi has once again come up with a product that will eat the lunch of BMW and Mercedes.  The price is competitive enough on this car to make SU 2000 and Miata buyers to take note of this car on account of its style and finish quality

Audi has a growing network of dealerships and these cars are pricey to work on.  I have owned Audi's previous to this car and you can expect to drop $600 at least any time you take it into the shop.  Even still, this car is so satisfying, much like other Audis that it is worth every penny.  Obviously in during the warranty period it is not going to cost you a thing to have the car worked on.  

This is a great car and I think one who test drives it will surely purchase one.<br><br>
