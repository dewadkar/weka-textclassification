            My wife and I travel quite often.  I always forget to bring the camera or if I do, I don't take many pictures or develop the film when returning home.  I'm glued to my laptop at least 3-4 hours a day and thought a digital camera would be the ticket.

I did some research and was sold on the Kodak DC260.  When visiting my friend who works at Ultimate Electronics she informed me that they did not carry Kodak cameras and that she recently got back from Hawaii with their new Sony DSC-p50.  I value her opinion and the cost was a bit more but I am a big Sony fan and havn't been disapointed yet.  This was no exception. 

I bought the camera right before a trip to Cancun in early December.  Wow it was easy to use and the additional 64mb memory stick was great.  I never ran out of space and took nearly 70+ pics.

The Stamina battery was nearly $119 with AC charger and camera bag but the best item about the camera.  Without it the camera is worthless.  Just plan on spending an additional $150 for the accesory package and additional memory stick.

The picture quality is excellent and great zoom capabilities.  The downfall is indoor night pictures, quality is very dissapointing.  I took some pictures when relatives were in from out of town over Christmas to e-mail them.  I took 10-12 pictures wich came out grainy even with the flash.  I guess nothing is perfect. 

Overall I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to suggest the Sony to others.  A good friend bought the Kodak DC260 and the quality for $50 less isn't comparible.  

You won't be dissapointed
