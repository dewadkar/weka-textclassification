            I bought a used 1992 Nissan Stanza in 1996 from a mechanic. At the time I purchased the vehicle it has 78,000 miles on it. The car ran great for 2years. I had to replace the clutch which was very costly. The good things is that the car had the original clutch in it,so that told me the durability of the car. 
This year I have had to replace the power steering pump,which again was very expensive. Everything else in the car is the original parts. I now have 176,000 miles on the car and its still going strong. I strongly recommend Nissans to anyone looking for a durable car. This car is great for a college student
Again,the only disadvantage is the cost of the parts. If you can find a good mechanic you can beat the price of the dealership. I also learned that the majority of the parts that have to be replaced must be ordered by the dealer,so you won't be able to find the parts at your local car parts store. Excellent car whether new or used. <br><br>
