            I was gifted Casio's QV-3000EX 3.34 Megapixel digital camera about two years ago for my birthday (by a rich uncle) when it was just released in the market. To me, this seemed like the perfect choice. Even though it cost my uncle a fortune, I don't complain about it one bit, for a gift is a gift, even though it is an expensive one.

The best feature of this innovative device is its removable IBM MicroDrive - a mammoth 340MB hard drive the size of a miniature matchbox. That's enough room to save 250 images at a maximum resolution of 2048 by 1536 resolution. Alternatively, you can use the unit to capture scores of 30-second AVI video clips at 320 by 240 resolution. Better still, you can use a combination of crisp still shots and video. Unfortunately,there's no audio.

The camera packs a razor sharp 3X Canon optical zoom lens, which you can increase effectively to 6X, with the digital zoom activated. I was especially attracted to the long list of features and modes that this has to offer. You can fine-tune image quality and appearance, shoot panoramas (joins individual images into a multi-photo panoramic picture), take time exposures in low light, and capture portraits or macros with soft backgrounds (for extreme close-up images). But perhaps the best feature of this whole deal is Casio's Photo Loader software that automatically launches and downloads all images when the camera is attached to a USB port or to the MicroDrive.

Image quality is simply excellent. Colours are vibrant and look realistic. Moreover, images come out sharp and well defined. 

The only disadvantage with this device is the fact that with the MicroDrive attached, its rechargeable NiMH batteries run out within an hour's time. So, you have to be sure to keep a quartet of batteries on hand. The camera's design seemed a bit bulky to me, but I guess that's because of the removable MicroDrive. 

All in all, this is the perfect choice for serious photographers and will certainly overwhelm novices with its wealth of features.
