            After driving a 1990 Sunbird for over 3 years, I finally traded it in for a 1995 Saturn SL2.  I got an incredible deal on the car and it's fully loaded, power everything, sunroof/moonroof, all leather interior.  It drives beautifully!  The seats and neck rests adjust in so many positions, anyone could find comfort in them.  I've dreamed of owning a Saturn for years after hearing so many good things about them and after only owning it for 3 months, I am VERY pleased!  One week after bringing it home, my husband decided he wanted one instead of his truck so we now own 2 (the other is a 1994, same exact features).  The insurance is dirt cheap on them thanks to all of the safety features Saturn has.  We love our Saturns so much we named them Pandora and Phoebe, after 2 of the moons on Saturn.  Is that love or what????<br><br>
