            The Grand Cherokee is THE BEST SUV I have ridden in. With all time four wheel drive this monster can take you virtually anywhere you'd like to go. While on those bumpy off road trail, there is less bouncing due to the padded leather seats underneath you. Not only do the seats recline, but they can be automatically adjusted to your own specified height or and other position with the push of a button. Rear folding seats allow fro extra luggage you might aquire or need for long trips. The pare tire is stored inside the car to insure security and hardly takes up any space.
Keyless entry is also a benefit for when you're in those not so nice neighborhoods where you don't have time to be fumbling through your keys to find the right on. Also, you'll never have to worry about locking your keys in the car. You aren't able to lock the doors while exiting the car if the keys are still in the ignition. Automatic lights are nice to. You can leave the light setting on automatic and you have no problems. They stay off during the day and then turn themselves on when the light goes down. They even switch off automatically after you abandon the vehicle. If you leave the lights on the normal setting, you'll get a dinging as you exit the car to remind you to turn them off. A built in overhead compass tells which direction you're headed and the themometor gives you the outside temperature. The heat and air conditioning can both br set to the degree you want, and you can even switch between farienhiet and celcius. This vehicle has all the requirements for any off road vehicle and all sweet accessories for the perfect on road vehicle also. It's a great.<br><br>
