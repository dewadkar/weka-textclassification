            This car was bought for our family of 4 as a family car.  I also drive it to work everyday (I am a music teacher and I have to carry around a lot of stuff).   It is a very roomy car.  It is great for road trips-my sister, her little girl, my kids, and I are going from IL to CO this summer in it.  There is lots of storage space in the back.  This vehicle handles wonderfully on the road, and I once had to stop from going 70 to let a squirrel cross the road 10 feet ahead on a country road.  One time, a crazy woman backed into my door while I was driving, and I barely even felt a bump!  I can also take the seat in the way back up to the seat in the back (take out the back's bucket seats)  to fit 5 people inside instead of 4 with the same amount of storage space.  (The back is so big without the seats that we fit an upright piano in there!) The car stopped in time, and the squirrel crossed safely!  This is even a &quot;sporty&quot; minivan (if there is such a thing.) It has a great 10 speaker stereo system.  A great family car!<br><br>
