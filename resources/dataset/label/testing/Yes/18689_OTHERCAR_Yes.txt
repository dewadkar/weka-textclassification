            The C-2000 is the best digital I've encountered. It's the closest digital I've found to the standard SLRs that I'm familiar with, with all the expected SLR-type features -- even ASA &quot;film-speed&quot; selection. I replaced the Smart Media card with a larger capacity card (16 Meg) and purchased a Flash 3.5&quot; diskette Smart Media reader, which makes for a nice package. The camera has never disappointed me. In fact, it has consistently amazed me in the quality of the images it takes. With a little tweaking in Photoshop, I've been able to produce top-quality photos from just so-so images. And printing the images at about 200 dpi on an Epson Photo inkjet produces results that are difficult to distinguish from a conventional photo. If you can find them, the prices have plunged because the 2000 has been replaced by the 2020 and the 3030. These newer models add higher resolution, more features, and correct some minor problems with the 2000. I would buy one of the new models in a minute if something happened to my 2000. Olympus knows how to build digitals.<br><br>
