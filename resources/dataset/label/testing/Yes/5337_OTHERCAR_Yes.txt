            Before purchasing our Grand Voyager I was one of the people who swore i would NEVER drive a mini van. I drove an SUV (Jeep Grand Cherokee). 
After the birth of our first child we made numerous trips a month to my home town (Atlanta) 4 hours away. That Jeep would be so loaded i was afraid we would lose our daughter in there.
You also realize after you have one child that if you want to go anywhere with another couple you end up taking two cars because you have no room.
We started looking for the right vehicle and to my surprise it was a mini van! I tried anything with a third seat. The suburban was just too big!
With all the extras in this van i never really feel like I'm in a &quot;mini van&quot;
It has 4 captains chairs, 10 cups holders, cd player, 4 doors, dual temp control plus a separate control for back seat passengers, ect.... The list just goes on.
I felt it was a bit high in price when we started looking but in comparison they are all round the same once you figure in the extras.
My van is 3 years old and still looks like new. I just put new tires on it and had the water pump checked and that is all I've done besides routine maintenance.
I have since looked at the Durangos's thinking I'd like a sportier look. My Mother has one and once you ride in it you realize it's not as functional for a family. No leg room in the second seat even for children.
I love my van and recommend it to anyone with children.
