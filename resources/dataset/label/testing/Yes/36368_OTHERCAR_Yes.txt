            When we had our first child it dawned on my husband and I that the little sport car in our driveway was NOT going to cut it. We couldn't even fit the carseat in the back seat! So I set out to find a reliable, nice looking, affordable and safe car for all of us. I had a few choices, but the Accord was my final one!
 We purchased an EX model with lots of bells and whistles(my husband HAD to have them), and I just fell in love with it! The ride was so smooth and quiet. And the EXCELLENT gas mileage wasn't too shabby either. We owned it for a little over 3 years and and had no problems.
 We have since had 2 more children and grown into a MUCH larger vehicle, but I would certainly recommend this car to anyone!
