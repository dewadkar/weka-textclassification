            I am a single parent and need a reliable car for transportation of the children to school and myself to work.  I am on my third Toyota, my second Camry.  The Camry is definately reliable, dependable and seems to run forever on a tank of gas.  My Camry is 4 cylinder and the ride is a little rough, however, I have driven the V6 and it has a smooth, quiet ride and lots of power.  The front seats are really comfortable for extended trips.  The cooling system can really crank it out to fight our
100+ degree summers here in Texas.  This 4 cylinder of mine is zippy, handles extremely well and the ABS braking system is great.  Mine has kept me from sliding many times.  Another great thing I love about my Toyotas is this:  I am a large woman, and I understand from talking to some of my large women friends that some of the other car manufacturers' seat belts do not fit.  Some will provide an 'extender', either free or at a small charge.  Saturn has small belts and will not make nor provide extenders for larger people.  Well, we can take our money elsewhere and purchase a car from a manufacturer who understands that 'one size fits all' is a lie.  I have had a Toyota Tercel, a Toyota Camry station wagon, and now my Camry LE and even for a big woman, there is ample room in the seat belt.  I highly recommend this car.<br><br>
