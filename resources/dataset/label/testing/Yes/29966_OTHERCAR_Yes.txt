            After learning that I was expecting my third child, my husband and I realized that it was probably time to start thinking about buying a minivan.  At first we thought that minivans were &quot;nerdy&quot; and maybe we should just stick it out in our very sporty Honda Passport.  Getting closer to my due date and realizing that our very sporty SUV was seeming smaller and smaller we started shopping for a minivan.  After researching all makes and models we decided on the Dodge Grand Caravan Sport.  It is the best buy out there.  It is very luxurious and there is so much room.  I was worried about not having enough cargo/trunk space.  The Grand Caravan has enough room in the trunk to comfortably fit a double stroller and there is always plenty of room for groceries.  I also couldn't believe how well it drove and how easy it is to handle. It is very peppy and yet it is extremely smooth.  The kids all fit very comfortably, and there is still room for more passengers.  This was definitely a great buy.<br><br>
