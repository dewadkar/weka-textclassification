            Wow...that was the first word I said after my first Mini Cooper test drive.  This car is the most fun I've ever had on 4 wheels.  See, I have been driving a Land Rover Discovery for years, and never in a million years thought I'd end up with a Mini Cooper.  Well I took delivery of mine before the Mini hype started, so I didn't have to wait for more than a month.  Now I hear the wait can be anywhere from 2-4 months depending on dealership.  I got a dark silver Mini Cooper S w/ the sport, premium and cold weather packages along w/ the HK sound system.  For all the BMW-like amenities...I only payed $23500.  

The best way to describe the car is it is like a BMW built go-kart.  It feels very solid (the frame is stronger than BMW's 3-series).  The materials feel rich, BMW-like.  The ergonomics are great, even the center mounted speedometer which makes for a unique driving experience.  The sport seats are very supportive and are easy to find a good position.  I'm 6' ft.  and have no problems with leg room, front or back.  I actually have a friend that is 6'3" that prefers sitting in the back!  But trunk space is only good enough for a couple of bags of grocery, but if you fold down the seats...it's actually pretty roomy.  Performance wise, the engine lacks torque for freeway passing.  Also the engine has a stumble issue that MINIUSA is working out. With the addition of a 15% pulley and a new ECU ($600 for both), this really opens up your engine to power.  With those mod's, the car's speed is very comparable to a BMW 330i.  I highly recommend this mod from http://www.turnermotorsport.com/html/index.asp?content=project_mini.shtml.  Handling is simply phenominal.  I find myself taking turns at twice the speed of any other car on the road.  Simply put, no other car is in the same league as the Mini is this department.  BMW did a great job w/ the suspension.  The brakes, although a bit small, provide great stopping and feedback.  The safety of this car is also much better than what most people think.  It&#146s built by BMW ,so you know it is safe.  I have read stories of Minis in accidents with Suburbans with the Mini and it&#146s occupants just fine.  The biggest problem I have are the 17" inch S-lite wheels that come with the sport package, they are by no means light.  Each one weighs in at over 25lbs!  So changing to lighter wheels will benefit the performance some.  Even my brother who drives a much faster Subaru WRX admitted that the Mini is more fun to drive.  It's hard to explain this phenomenon, but it just is amazing to drive.  All it took was one test drive, if you haven't driven one yet...do it
