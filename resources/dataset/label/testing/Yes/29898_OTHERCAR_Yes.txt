            My last car was a leased '99 Oldsmobile Alero and overall I'd have to say that my experience with Oldsmobile was good.  They have they options I want and styling that I like.  So when the lease was up and with my children getting bigger, of course, the first think I looked at was Old's next size up car, the Intrigue.  After doing the usual haggling I sat down for my first test drive of the car.  At first I thought "uh-oh, this is just a bigger Alero."  And certainly all of the styling cues were the same, an almost identical instrument panel, etc.  But I started her up anyway and now, after owning it for a couple of weeks, I can definitely declare it is not just a bigger Alero.

While the fit and finish on the Alero were good, the Intrigue's are great.  The refinement in all aspects seems to be a notch or two better.  Since this is my first review, I'm going to steal the format of a predecessor to break things down for you.

EXTERIOR: 9
Wow, I love the looks of this car.  Clean and muscular.  I didn't get the rear-deck spoiler since I personally think the things "spoil" the looks of a car.  But if you like the "old" Olds Aurora, this definitely has the lines (IMHO the new Aurora looks like they just didn't quite finish before they went to production).  It is more of a family car than the Alero, but if you really want a sporty look, try Pontiac instead.  This car hasn't changed it's looks since it was introduced, and I don't see why they would.

INTERIOR: 8
Clean and useful.  Maybe not so much as some other cars I've driven (my Dad's '97 Sable had a much more useful center console/arm rest) but everything you need is there.  If you don't care for faux-wood grain finish or flashing dials, this is your pick.  The heated leather seats are a wonder on a cold winter day.  The rear seat has all the room my kids could ask for and I have to say I found the room quite agreeable when my Brother and Dad took turns up front for their "test drive".  The climate control is a breeze, just set the temperature you want and forget about it.  It even determines if you need the defrosters on or not.  And if the passenger wants to be a little warmer or cooler, he just turns a knob.  As for the sound system, well, the car I initially test drove had the Bose system in it.  I decided against it and haven't been the least disappointed.  In the words of some of my teenage friends, "this car rocks!"

ENGINE: 9
The 3.5L 215 HP V6 "shortStar" engine gives out 230 lb.-ft. of torque.  This engine a 6 cylinder version of the Aurora (NorthStar) V8.  Red-lining at 6400 RPM, you definitely feel it when the torque kicks in.  It just has a refined sound and feel to it.  While it will get you off the line fairly well, I think the Alero was a bit quicker to break the rubber loose.  Of course it may be the bigger tires and better traction control on the bigger car that keep in touch with the pavement.  At highway speeds though, I can't imagine it much better.  The surge of power at higher RPMs and the 6400 RPM red-line are incredible.

HANDLING: 8
My Alero was such an upgrade from my old Pontiac 6000 that I really didn't expect much improvement here, but once again I was surprised.  The anti-lock brakes and traction control seem a step or two above what was already sufficient in the smaller car.  The variable assist steering makes turning in tight spaces at slow speeds a breeze, while keeping highway speed handling from drifting too much.  It's ride is like a large car, but handles at least as well as the Alero in the curves.

RIDE: 8
Smooth and quiet.  I drive only 5 miles to work but have over 35 lights to get through on my daily round trip.  And in Michigan, of course you have to deal with the potholes and road crews fixing the potholes.  Even with all this stopping and starting and dodging the potholes and the fine ladies and gentlemen fixing them, I can enjoy my ride to work.  My kids are still bugging me to just go out for a drive.

RELIABILITY: 9
OK, I've only had the car 2 weeks, but I did my research before I bought this car.  You can probably do your own research but remember this.  This car hasn't significantly changed since its introduction several years ago.  Most first model year cars are bound to have some problems but by the second or third year they get the bugs worked out, if anything just to avoid the warranty work.  And speaking of warranty, 5 years/60,000 miles isn't bad.  And if you're worried about Oldsmobile not being there, remember that if/when they're gone, you can get your car serviced at any GM dealership, something they frowned on in the past.

VALUE: 8 
These aren't the cheapest cars out there, but the 2.9% financing sure helps (0% if you can pay it all in 3 years instead of 5).  I've driven/ridden in the Sable/Taurus and while they cost less, they also "feel" less.  This car "feels" like most luxury cars I've driven in the past.  I don't know about the imports.  Living near Detroit, it always seemed un-American to send your money over-seas.  But I'd be surprised to see much better than this car.

THE VERDICT: LOVE THE CAR.
A beautiful car with a wonderful engine, handling, and ride to match.  Plus those little extras that make you happy weeks later when you notice them.
