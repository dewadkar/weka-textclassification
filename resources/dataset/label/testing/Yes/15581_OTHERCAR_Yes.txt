            I find that my GMC can out-run most of my friends cars (one of my friends has a dodge neon and put about $600 into performance) and my truck is stock and AUTOMATIC(I find this amusing). I love my truck, it is reliable, and gets up to 90 mph in no time. 0-60 in about 8 seconds(not positive)and the V6 4.3L makes the light weight truck very nice. I bought it from my grandpa for a buck, cant beat that! If you want to make a racing truck I would say this is a cheap way to start, just make sure you get the engine upgrade that I have. 
   I love the way the style is, it looks sleek and would be awesome if lowered and had a body kit. I see too many people out there with Hondas thinking they are cool. But how many trucks do you see that have nice mufflers and engine modifications. Trust me, if I had the money to do this I would. With a paint job my truck would be one of the best here in Klamath Falls.
