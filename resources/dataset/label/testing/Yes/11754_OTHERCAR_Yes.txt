            Having had Kodak cameras in the past, from the &quot;Brownie&quot;, a 110 instamatic, and then a automatic focus 35 mm, I knew that Kodak continued to make reliable products for photography. When I saw this <b>Kodak DC3200</b> bundled with a <b>Picture Maker 100</b> printer, I knew I could not go wrong. I wanted a simple-to-use digital camera by a name I could trust.

The price was unbeatable for the bundle at $379.00 with a $50.00 rebate. The <b>Kodak DC3200</b> can be found for $189.00 to $219.00 in stores and on the web. The <b>Kodak Picture Maker 100 by Lexmark</b> can be bought for around $179.00 to $199.00 also. So I feel that I got a good deal buying them together. Especially, since extra supplies came with the bundle, such as printer cable, paper, camera adapter, album page, compact flash card, and serial transfer cable.

I have been practicing with the camera for weeks so I would be ready for the holiday picture taking. The manual is so easy to follow with step by step instructions. Even a novice digital photographer like me can be taking pictures in just a few minutes.  I recommend reading the manual thoroughly so you can get the full benefit from the features of this camera. I have tried them all, to see what each entails.

<b>What do I love about this camera?</b>
Actually I haven't found anything I don't love about it so far.  It is just perfect for my everyday and holiday picture taking. It is lightweight, comfortable to hold, and buttons are easy to access. It is a 1.2 megapixel with 1152 x 864 pixels with means I can get good quality 5 x 7's. I have to attest to that, they are really good. I even made an 8 x 10 that was a little on the grainy side, but acceptable. 

It is a point and shoot camera. Once you set your functions on the LCD screen you just have to aim and shoot. The functions can stay preset to your preferences until you change them. There is a 2x zoom, which is adequate for my use, but if you want a camera to take to sporting events or school programs, your shots from the audience would not be close-up enough with just a 2x zoom.

The flash modes are: automatic (for regular use), fill (to fill in on cloudy days or when needed), and off (for &quot;secret&quot; no flash photography places...haha). 

It has a 2 MB internal memory so you can actually take a few pictures without using a removable compact flash card. It came with a 4 MB compact flash card, but for a day of picture taking, such as a holiday, that would not be enough. Flash cards come in all sizes, from 4 MB to 198 MB...and maybe even more for professionals.  

The LCD screen is a 1.6 inch view. It really has a vivid picture quality to preview your photos and review the functions on your camera. You can see your photo before you take it, instantly after you take it, or go back and review all your photos to keep or delete any you choose. With my practicing, I have deleted many because of my &quot;playing&quot; around with the features and settings.

The camera came with 4 AA batteries, but it is recommended to purchase Ni-MH batteries and charger if you want to get more life from your batteries. The original batteries lasted through taking about 40 pictures, and many hours of playing, deleting, and viewing the LCD function screen. The drain on the batteries is really from using the LCD screen.

It came with a wriststrap, which I immediately attached since I didn't not want to drop it while shooting. The Kodak software took just seconds to install on my computer so I can transfer the photos onto my computer with the serial transfer cable. It is much faster to use a USB transfer card reader, unless you have all day to transfer photos. The AC adapter is so that your batteries are not needed in the transfer process when using the serial cable. Or you can use the adapter if you want to use the LCD screen for extended periods of time to view photos, etc.

Photos can be taken in different qualities:<i> Best, Better, and Good.</i> The highest quality requires more memory on a picture card, so you will get less pictures. I am using a 20 mb card and on the BEST mode I will get 60 photos. On the Good mode I would get around 150. Of course,after printing or uploading on my computer, I can delete any or all, and reuse my card over and over. 

The flash is very bright! Everyone has remarked just how &quot;blinding&quot; it is. I have noticed that many times I don't even need to use a flash. Some of my best photos are without the flash. Of course with the brightness of snow outside glaring through the windows for the last month, we are having unusually bright white conditions inside and out.

The compactflash card slips into a compartment on the bottom of the camera, very easy to insert and remove. The compactflash cards are tiny, about the size of a VERY flat matchbox.

<b>Extras I have purchased to make my <i>Kodak DC3200</i> even better:</b>

I wanted a <i>lens cap</i> to protect the lens from smudges and damage. It was $4.95 from the Kodak website. I bought a <i>camera bag </i>(not Kodak, Samsonsite) at Walmart for $7.00. It carries the camera, adapter, batteries, and other things easily. I purchased the <i>20 MB compactflash card</i> for a great price of $29.95 at a holiday sale on the Kodak website. It would be regularly $59.95. I ordered a <i>Kodak Picture Launch Compact Flash Reader</i> from Kodak for $39.95, but haven't received it yet. The Lexar Card reader I found locally, I could not get to work for me, so I decided to go with Kodak again. I also purchased online the <i>Kodak Ni-Mh battery charger with 4 EXTRA batteries</i> for $29.95. So that makes 8 rechargeable batteries I have now, instead of the AA regular batteries.

The Kodak website is just jam-packed with goodies for you to browse through for your Kodak camera, or for any camera. It has accessories for any camera.

The compactflash card can be inserted directly into the PM100 printer to print out beautiful photos without using the computer. That is the great feature of the Picture Maker printer. Using the flash cards was one of the reasons I bought the <b>Kodak DC3200</b>, you can find them everywhere in all sizes.

For a beginning digital photographer, or your everyday photo capturing, I don't think you could go wrong with the <b>Kodak DC3200</b>. It has lived up to the Kodak quality you would expect. Having the Kodak website (www.kodak.com) to go to for support and additional accessories is like having an added benefit also.

You can  upload your photos to the Kodak site and make and send your photos to others, or just STORE them on the site. I was able to edit, crop, and correct some photos I had taken previously that weren't taken with the Kodak even. You can even have them develop your digital photos for you!

Kodak, thanks for making another great camera!
