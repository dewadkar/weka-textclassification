            I'm not sure what to think about the Subaru Forester.  I was ready for a change when I bought it so I had lots of time to think over my decision to purchase it.  I knew I was in trouble when I picked the vehicle up from the dealer after signing the loan papers.  The &quot;door ajar&quot; light would not go out.  After a few minutes of walking around the car and opening/closing every door, the light went out.  Turns out that it only goes out when it is good and ready to.  After two years, the light still comes on at random and now has linked up with the overhead/map light and that now goes on while I am driving down the road.  (The first time that happened was at night and I kept looking for someone in the back seat!)  

The transmission is annoying also.  The dealer told me that it is &quot;normal.&quot;  Apparently, to save wear and tear on the brakes, the AWD system downshifts when you apply the brakes while on a downhill.  Strange!  The speed change is so severe that I lunge forward in my seat when the car decelerates.

People ask me if I like my Subaru Forester S.  Overall, I guess I do.  It handles well, has plenty of interior room, I like the heated seat option, is great for hauling stuff around and I don't have to pamper it.  I don't care for the design though.  The exterior is kind of boxy.  The interior controls are not intuitive and the heater outlet at the foot area is lame.  In all fairness, I'd recommend it.  But I doubt that I would buy another one.<br><br>
