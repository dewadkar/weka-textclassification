            Interesting title but I believe it to be true. Because of the high residual value of the Honda Accord EX-V6 Coupe (the vehicle in review), lease payments are very high and standard Honda Financing and affilliate bank lease programs offer limited mileage options.

If you can afford this car, buy it! 

Style:
The smooth lines and dynamic look create a very attractive vehicle. If you're the type to add accessories, you can purchase the wing, the sunroof/moonroof shield, or the full or hood bra (all extras) to accentuate your needs.

Comfort:
Although some complain of a "boxy" look, this allows for plenty of arm and leg room and a very nicely sized passenger compartment without jeopardizing aerodynamics. Leather interior is of very high quality and softens to the broken in point while still looking brand new. Ergonomically, everything is in perfect reach for the driver and the passenger. 

Driving:
This car is powerful and very low maintenance. You can maintain 80mph easily without thinking you've exceeded 45mph. Suspension makes the ride tight and controlled. Sound level, from a 1-10, would be an 8 or 9.  
Front wheel drive along with its weight and tire configuration combine for a smooth, dependable and safe ride in inclement weather, snow, rain, and slushy ice.
