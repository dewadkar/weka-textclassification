            This 96 Cavalier has been a really outstanding car for me, I have had no major problems with is car at all since a have purchased it new.  It's really a surprize to me because I have about 70,000 miles on it now. It may seem a lot but I have used it to commute a good distance to college and well as some heavy highway traveling. I mostly have highway miles on this car. I pretty much needed a small durable car to drive around in without having to worry about any constant repairs and improvements needed with a descent used car. 

I only things that I have replaced on the car which have even lasted longer than I would have thought possible were all four tires as well as the front brakes. I got about  65,000 miles on my original brakes which is just unbelieveable to me.  I only replaced the front brakes due to the fact that I still have a good thousand miles left on the back.

This car is ideal for long car trips across state because the seats are comfortable contoured and relaxing to sit in, and the plus is It gets great gas milege.  There also is good safety features such as the dual airbags for the driver and the passager. And you really do get a very smooth ride driving, You would really have no trouble reading or sometimes writing during car trips due to the smooth ride.  

As for the car's space to move around and haul certain items, it indeed has the extended room with the backseat having the ability to fold down and back to allow larger, longer items to be placed in the car.  The backseat  is very comfortable and has more space for foot room than one would think for a relatively small car. 

I really have no serious complains about this car, the only thing that would be really noticeable is that sometimes the front console and dash rattles somewhat but it's really only minor.  Some people have complained that there is no steeling wheel adjustment but I really don't notice it and it hasn't really bothered me.This car would be great for students, first new car and even a first time family car because this really is a great dependable car that will get you anywhere without having to maintain it often and it has a very comfortable ride
