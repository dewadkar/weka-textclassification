            Who says a mother of 5 can't drive a sporty car?  Not me!  I purchased a 1999 Grand Am GT last May and I love it.  My two previous vehicles were Honda products and having really enjoyed both of them, I was a bit reluctant to purchase anything else.  However, after test driving the Pontiac Grand Am GT, I was hooked.  

As far as leg room and space inside the vehicle, it is comparable to the Honda Accord.  It is a comfortable ride for the driver and front passenger.  The back passengers may not be quit as comfortable though.  If you have children that require car seats, you better hope at least one of the people riding in the front are not too tall.  When car seats are placed on either side, the amount of leg room available depends on the position of the front seats.  My four year old found it very uncomfortable to ride in the car seat behind his father, who is over 6' tall.  

The Pontiac Grand Am GT may not be the most comfortable car for large families, but it is a fun car to drive.  It handles nicely and has the power to get up and move when necessary.  I'm not one to do a lot of fast driving but when I need to pass someone out on the road, I like to get it done and get back in my own lane as quickly as possible, and this car lets me do that with confidence.

Equipped with all the latest bells and whistles, this vehicle will notify you if one of your tires is low, when it is time to change the oil, if your gas cap is not on tight, when your seat belt isn't buckled, if you have left the keys in the ignition, and a multitude of other things.  At first, I wasn't sure I appreciated all these features because I tend to panic when lights and bells start going off at me.  But once I read the manual and became familiar with the different messages and their meanings, I have become rather spoiled to these extra features.  My favorite is the automatic headlights. They come on when the vehicle starts and then shut off a few seconds after the vehicle is turned off, and as one who has had to look for a jump start on many a foggy morning after forgetting to turn off my head lights, I can really appreciate this feature.  The only draw back to this is that people in parking lots are always yelling at me to let me know I have left my headlights on, not knowing of course,that they go off by themselves after a few seconds.

The exterior of the Grand Am GT is very sleek and sporty looking.  The spoiler and body design, as well as the window tinting (which is optional)make it a very attractive vehicle.  However, I have found that the tires on this car are not your average passenger car tires and are rather costly to replace.  In addition, this car sits relatively low to the ground, and although it performs great on the highway, it is not something you would want to use if you do much driving on country roads or bumpy pavement.  I have found I tend to have a problem entering and exiting some driveways without dragging, if I am not being extremely  careful.  

The Grand Am GT gets good gas mileage.  Not as good as the Honda, but then the Honda didn't have as much power either.  I tend to average somewhere around 27 miles to the gallon.  Another feature I like is the low fuel signal.  I tend to get busy and forget to refuel, but this car reminds me well before I am in danger of actually running out of gas, and keeps reminding me every time I start the car. 

The trunk space is about average, nothing spectacular, but certainly roomy enough for both the stroller and groceries. There is a trunk release button inside the car with an added feature I really like.  It will not work while the car is in gear.  It only works once the car is in park preventing the trunk from being opened accidentally while the car is going down the road.

Thus far, I have had very good experiences with the Pontiac service departments.  They have been helpful, friendly and quick about getting my car in regularly for service.  I really like the roadside assistance package that came with my vehicle.  Just a week after I got my new car my 4 year old  decided to be helpful and locked the doors when he got out, not realizing that my purse with both sets of keys in it, was still sitting in the front seat.  I called the 800 number and a locksmith was dispatched immediately to bring me a new key at no charge.

When comparing prices, the Grand Am GT actually offered more luxury options than many other cars in the same price range, and in most cases was a much more attractive vehicle.  Buying a new car is probably one of my least favorite things to do, but I certainly have enjoyed my new Grand Am GT.  If I'm lucky, I won't be going car shopping again for a long time.
