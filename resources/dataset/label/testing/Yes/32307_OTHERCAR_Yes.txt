            First off, let me say that I love Nissans!  My 1999 Sentra GXE is clean, economical, and maneuvers well in the tightest of spaces.  This is my second Sentra, and it's loaded with tons of options!  I got the Special Edition package, which features AM/FM/CD and cruise control, among other options.

Like I said, the Sentra's light weight makes it highly maneuverable and fuel-efficient, major concerns for drivers on a tight fuel budget (and who isn't?).  But what about highway/interstate mileage?

Well, I just gave my Sentra its first major taste of highway driving with a trip from Birmingham, Alabama to Branson, Missouri.  It got killer mileage, averaging 30 -35 or more... but at a price.  The light weight of the Sentra, while wonderful in cities, is a liability on long highway trips through areas such as Arkansas where fierce crosswinds blow... and potentially lethal if truckers pass you at insane speeds, or try to crush you between them on I-40 crossing the Mississippi...

In conclusion, the Sentra is great for knocking around town, but for highways... take a tank!<br><br>
