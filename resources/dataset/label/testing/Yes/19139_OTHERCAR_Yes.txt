            Before my husband and I purchased the Volkswagen Passat Wagon we did extensive research on it.  We also had a Volkswagen Jetta and really liked it, so that is one of the reasons we were sticking with Volkswagen.  
The first thing that I noticed about the car was the way it handled the road; I loved it.  Even with the 4 cylinder 1.8 Turbo and 5 speed transmission the car accelerated like it was a 6 cylinder.  If you have never driven a German engineered car, you don't know what you are missing.  It is nothing like an American or Japanese car.
The second thing that I liked was the amount of room for the passengers in the rear.  My husband sits in the back with our daughter and he is 6 ft and 215lbs. There is a generous amount of head and leg room for him to stretch without hitting his head on the roof of the car.  There is also a lot of room in the rear for baby gear, groceries and a full size spare, which is hidden under the panel in the floor of the trunk.
The third thing I like about my Passat Wagon is how good it looks, for the price.  It looks like an Audi, but for $10,000 less!
The fourth thing I liked about this car was all the safety features that came standard.  It has a driver and passenger side airbag, side impact airbags, daytime running lights, and anti-lock brakes.  The Passat received a consumers best buy award for safety from a top selling family magazine.  It also was best pick in the Insurance and Highway Institutes offset crash test.  This was very important to my husband and I, who were planning on having children at the time we bought the car.  
Lastly, I love the dashboard lights in this car.  Everyone that has ridden in my car has commented on these.  They are purple and red, easy on the eyes at night, but very cool!
The only bad thing about this car is the limited warranty it comes with.  It's bumper to bumper for 2 years or 24,000 miles whichever comes first.  This is not long enough, in my opinion it should be at least 3 years.  Most other car companies give at least 36 months.  I have never had to replace anything under this warranty, but my 2 years ended in February 2001, knock on wood!  The drivetrain comes with the standard Volkswagen 10 year 100,000 mile protection plan, which is a plus.
