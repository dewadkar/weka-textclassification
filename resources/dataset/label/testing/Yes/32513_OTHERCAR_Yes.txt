            Audi A6 sedan 2002

Ambition, Ambiente or Advanced?

You do not have to own a Rolls Royce or a Bentley to be able to personalize the interior of a car. It can be done with the Audi A6. Audi calls this selecting the atmosphere for the interior of your new automobile.

This gives each owner the opportunity to select the texture and appearance of the seats upholstery, the type of the wood grain and the color, plus the aluminum trim all this to make the interior of the car you drive nicer than your apartment. 

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Audi A6 sedan is a large automobile; aside from given the new owners the selection of the type of interior they want the A6 comes equipped with a very long list of standard features.

If the A6 is the car you are looking for than you will have to select the trim that you want. The A6 comes in four different models, the sedan, the Avant which is a wagon, the 2.7t and the 4.2.

Both the sedan and the Avant are equipped with a V-6 engine developing 200 horsepower, the 2.7t with a bi-turbo V-6 that develop 250 horsepower and the 4.2 with a V-8 that will give you 300 Horsepower.

The Audi A6 I drove is a sedan, so I will concentrate on this version of the A6.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The atmosphere selection of the A6 I drove was Ambiante, it is very conservative when I see what were the other options but this can be understood since the car is a demonstrator.

Nevertheless I did like the way the selection had been done. Who ever decided on the options did very well to my taste.

Once after taken place behind the steering wheel, I immediately noticed that I found the view from the rear to be a little obstructed, I tried to find a proper seat selection and adjusting the rear view mirror but I never could get exactly how I would have liked. If I had purchased this car, I would have the dealer re-position the rear view mirror.

From the driver&#146s seat all the gauges are easy to see and all the control buttons are within easy reach of the driver.

The Audi A6 comes with a long list of standard equipment: Air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, tilt steering, heated seats, AM/FM cassette radio, rear window defrost and alloy wheels.

I just can not understand why in a car that price, Audi refuses to put a CD player as standard equipment. Audi will have to get on the ball with this one for sure.

The legroom and headroom for both the front seats and rear seats passenger is very good.

The exterior:

Looking at the Audi A6 from the exterior you would not guess how luxurious the interior is. Not that the exterior is bad, it is just that it gives no indication that the A6 is a near-luxury automobile.

The selection of alloy wheel is very nice for the A6; I would have like to see some chrome but not for this year on the A6.

The cargo space is excellent at 17.2 cubic feet of volume available for your gear.
