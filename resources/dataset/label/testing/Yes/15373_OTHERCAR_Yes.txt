            I received this camera as a gift from my husband. We had a friend pass away a few days before our anniversary and so he gave it to me early.  I went up north to be with my friend and brought this camera with me.  I never even opened it till I got there. 

The camera was easy to operate even the first time. The instructions were very understandable. I filled up 12 floppies at my friend's house and she was so thankful. I was able to print them up on her computer before I even left to go home.  She was thrilled to have those memories so quickly. The color was vivid, and they did not appear grainy like other digital pictures from other cameras I had seen. 

Since then I have used it almost weekly. I work for a Parks &amp; Recreation Dept. and I can easily take pictures of the events and have the results immediately. At first I thought I would not like the view screen as it is quite dark to see through in the sun but then when I read further in the manual it explained about the brightness + and - and now I no longer have that problem. 

I have had this camera for 16 months now and have had no problems.  Anyone who wants to take good pictures and have great results should buy this camera. It is dependable and works in any weather.  We have taken it camping with us and it even took a beautiful picture of a night moon sky. I also took a picture of the ice fields over Juneau AK. from a jet through the window. Beautiful pictures they are!<br><br>
