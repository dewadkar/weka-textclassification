            My husband and I own an Audi A4.  Last year, after having no trouble from this car we decided to lease an A6 through our business.  I love this car!  The A4 is fun to drive; it is manual and maneuvers easily in and out of traffic.  The A6 is the most powerful, luxury car I have driven in quite sometime.  We test drove BMWs and Mercedes before we went back to the Audi A6.

This car has plenty of room on the inside.  Even a tall person can sit comfortably in the back seat.  The trunk is huge, it gets great gas mileage, and the service from the dealership where we leased it is outstanding.  

I have always driven Nissans and Toyotas, but Audi has me loyalty now.  My next car will be an A8 and my husband wants the TT.  Maybe for Christmas!<br><br>
