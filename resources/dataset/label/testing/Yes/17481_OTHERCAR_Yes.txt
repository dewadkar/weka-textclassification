            Our 2002 Kia Sedona has been nothing but good to us thus far.  The ride is nice.  It fits my wife, 6 yr old son, two of his friends, my infant daughter in her car seat and myself very comfortably.  Not a ton of room left in the very rear of the van if it's all full, but we make do.  If one, or both of the very back seats are vacant, we just push them all the way forward and use them for our cooler, backpacks, bikes etc.

We purchased the base van.  The cheaper version if you will.  No bells and whistles.  We just had a baby girl and needed a larger vehicle, but had very little to spend and didn't want to still be paying on it until she graduated valedictorian!

So far no engine prob's or anything to speak of, and except for tiny little annoyances (front ash tray wont stay closed, back arm rest storage won't either) I love it.  We've moved since we bought it, and with those seats out in the back, it was a lifesaver!  Uhaul aint' got nothin' on us!

We bought ours at the end of 2002 for $19,000.  The warranty at this time was good for 100,000 miles on the  transmission.  The vehicle included the standard power windows/locks, CD player and roofrack...this also included anti-lock brakes which is *not* standard.

There is no question that this vehicle is not a BMW, but for the money, you get a whole heck of a lot of van!
