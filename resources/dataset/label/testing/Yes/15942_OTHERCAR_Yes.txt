            I've been looking for an affordable digital camera for quite a while and I finally bought an EPSON PhotoPC 650. It was only $280 on Buy.com and it comes with a USB enabled CompactFlash card.

On the whole, I'm quite impressed with the pictures. The colors are generally pretty accurate. It does a great job with bright colors, although occasionally some colors are darker than they appear. For example, I took a picture of the Rockies with a cloudless blue sky above them and the sky turned our darker blue than expected. However, pictures taken of my children in bright clothes have been excellent. 

I really like the ease of use of this camera. Most of the controls you need are buttons on the top of the camera. There are some modes to deal with in the LCD, but these are rarely needed.

Something else I really like is the USB enabled CompactFlash card. You simply plug it into the included JumpShot cable and the CompactFlash card becomes a hard disk on your computer. This makes getting photos very simple. It's also very quick! I'd hate to have to buy a separate CompactFlash reader just to get quick downloads. 

The megapixel size is more than adequate for me. With a digital camera, most of my pictures are destined for an online photo album. Indeed, I find that I can generally leave it on the lowest setting and still get good results. When I want 8x10s, I always go to a professional photographer, so I'll never need a 2 megapixel camera.<br><br>
