            In 1996 I bought my Neon new for my 18th birthday.  I needed new because I travel extensively between work and school and needed a reliable car.  My Neon has been perfect.  Comfortable, cute, fast,and best of all, reliable.  I didn't have to use the car phone for any calls to the mechanic.  Plus, they come with a great warranty, so if you do suspect something is wrong, take it in, and it's almost always nothing, free.  After putting on about 75K miles in 2 years, I traded mine in for a 1998 model, and this model is also awesome.  The car seems to have been upgraded extensively from '96, and my '98 is just as great.  This model seems to get even better gas mileage, a cd player that is great, and better interior design.  I have no complaints other than the car is somewhat noisy at high rates of speed, but that's only when going over 80.  I would recommend this car for the teenager, young adults, young families, and everyone else.  Two of my friends have also bought Neons after driving mine, and they are completely satisfied too.
