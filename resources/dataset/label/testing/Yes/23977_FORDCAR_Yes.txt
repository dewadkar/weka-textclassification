            We have been driving a custom conversion van for years.  Our Dodge was getting old, when looking for a new van, it was difficult to find a conversion package that we liked.  The Ford E150 with the Starcraft conversion package fit our needs.  We bought the van and in our first year of use have put over 15,000 miles on it traveling the Southwest.  The van has the 5.4 L Triton V-8, a good engine combination for the unit.  We tow a trailer, normally loaded with a car, and this motor and drive train combination has no difficulties in the Southwest mountains.  We have had no problems with the unit during our first year of use.  It handles the heat well, no overheating and the AC keeps us comfortable in the large cabin. It is comfortable to drive, the kids enjoy the conversion features and it has been extremely reliable. 

The CONS:  You can't drive with the front windows down, too much noise and wind input.  Even with the windows closed, there is a lot of wind noise around the front doors. They could have a better seal.

Quick update:  The brakes wore out ahead of where I would have thought, at 17,000 miles.  There are no &quot;tell tales&quot; on the brake pads, so you know they are gone when the pad is gone and you are grinding metal on metal.  I about wore out a front rotor real quick.  If you do a lot of stop and go driving, get them checked regularly after 12,000 miles.  I know in the future, I won't run a set of front pads past 15,000 miles, cheaper to change the pads than ruin the rotors.  <br><br>
