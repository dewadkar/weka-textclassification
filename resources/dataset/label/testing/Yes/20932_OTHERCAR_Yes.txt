            I fell in love with the Chrysler PT Cruiser &quot;at first sight,&quot; which was in January when my daughter received a brochure from her Chrysler dealer with a picture of it on the cover.  I read about the car in the magazine and also checked it out on the website.  I love the retro styling and the colors!  I have not had the privilege to drive this vehicle yet but I have sat in two of them.  One was a Patriot Blue base model and the other was a Silver limited.  The seats are nice and firm.  I felt there was ample legroom in the back.  I plan on having alot of fun &quot;tailgating&quot; this summer!  Anyone who desires a very different-looking automobile than the &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; models out there should look into getting one of these!  Its performance will be quite adequate for the average person going to work and doing their errands, etc.  It would also be comfortable on a long driving trip.  I haven't found anything yet that I hate about it!  It's adorable, affordable and efficient!<br><br>
