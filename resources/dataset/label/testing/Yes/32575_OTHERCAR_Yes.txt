            It was early 1997, and my husband and I were looking for a second car. We were newlyweds and very inexperienced at car buying. Many of the dealers we visited sensed this, and tried to use it to their advantage. Then we went to Saturn.

The first thing we noticed was the laid-back atmosphere. They didn't try to tell us what we wanted, they asked us what we wanted. There was no pressure, no price negotiation games (the part I had dreaded the most) and they seemed to really want to make us happy. It was totally different than any other dealership we had been to. 

We decided on a blue SL2. One of the things we really liked was the safety features. The car has daytime running lights, dual airbags and special crumple zones to make the car crumple in a certain way in the event of a crash. They actually have a wall with pictures of crashed up Saturns showing how they all seem to crumple in a very similar way in order to protect the passengers. The coolest thing about the doors in they are made of plastic and will actually bounce back if hit! At the time we were living in an apartment complex where dents in car doors was becoming a problem. These doors spring back if hit.. they even had a door in the showroom that you could kick to test it out. We also added the optional security system, which gave us a little transmitter to open and lock the car remotely. You can also pop the trunk by pushing the button, something I liked to do for fun. :)

Driving the car is a nice experience, it's a fairly quiet car and very smooth to drive. I'm no car expert, but I like to drive it. The traction control is very helpful in the snow and antilock breaks are helpful. The seats are comfortable and the engine is very responsive. We have a cassette player and radio, the sound is very good.

The car has behaved well in the last 3 years. We did have a problem with a check engine light staying on, but it turned out to be a minor problem with something I can't remember. We also needed a new battery about 6 months ago, which was thankfully under warranty. Otherwise all we have had done is routine maintenance. We have driven the car about 30,000 miles.

We are now a 2 Saturn family, so I guess that makes us a little biased. Saturns are nice reliable cars at reasonable prices sold by nice people. I think anyone who is looking for a car should look at a Saturn. The low pressure, no haggle policy makes car buying a pleasant experience. They take your picture with your car and cheer you on as you drive the car away from the lot. It sounds strange, but they really do believe in the Saturn family thing. 

Bottom line: If you are looking for a good car at a reasonable price, consider a Saturn.<br><br>
