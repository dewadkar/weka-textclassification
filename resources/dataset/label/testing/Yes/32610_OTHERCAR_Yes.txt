            I have a bright red 1997 BMW M3 4-Door, with "modena" tan interior.  It has a 5-speed manual and a single option; the on-board computer.  It now has 23,000 miles on it.  I just purchased it recently because it's been my dream car forever and the lease on my '98 Civic (see 12/00 review to feel my pain) is about to expire.

First off, it's a stunning looking car.  Initially, I wasn't thrilled with the idea of "Hellrot" red but I've since changed my mind.  The modena leather (baseball glove color) is just gorgeous and smells fantastic.  The paint and leather work are perfect in terms of fit and finish.  Lives up to its reputation for quality.  I don't think the car has a single quality related defect, and not so much as a single squeak or rattle.

The car's stance is low and mean, with those fat 245/40 rear tires giving it the perfect aggressive profile.  In traffic and in town, I was thrilled to learn that it grumbles along and behaves much more like an American muscle car than a German sedan associated with Yuppies.  It has short gearing and gives you that indescribable-in-words "power jerk" and little push at low speeds, with an engine sound that sounds almost like a V-8.  An elegant looking Bavarian sedan that valets will park in front of a restaurant possessed by the spirit of a long dead 1969 Pontiac GTO.  How cool is that!  

At speed is where the machine really shines.  Acceleration at highway speeds is utterly explosive and she'll rocket from 80-130 in very short order indeed, in 5th!  Shift down to 4th to pass at 70 and she quakes with power and blasts forward as though shot from a cannon.  I've found myself doing that for no reason at all several times on the highway.  Very fun!  

The only thing preventing a highway trip from being like something out of "Fantasy Island" is that the car needs a 6th gear.  5th gear in manual transmission versions of this car is not an overdrive, it's a 1:00 gear, so it's like you're driving a 1970 Olds 442 with a 3.23 gear on the expressway.  Automatic M3s have a .74 overdrive for 5th so they may be a tad better.  At 90, the tach is at 4g while the suspension and body are yawning and asking for 50-60 mph of more speed.  

And what a suspension it is!  The car, with its 50/50 weight distribution, sticks like glue and feels balanced and poised at all times.  The vehicle does go a little crazy when the road surface gets irregular, and will sometimes try to follow grooves in the road, which can be a little unnerving at first.  This probably has more to do with the stock (and no longer available) Michelin Pilot SX tires than the suspension though.  Steering feel?  Someone once wrote that this car's steering allows you to feel Lincoln's head if you run over a penny.  Well said.  The brakes will literally suck your eyeballs out of their sockets if you hit them hard.  

The only drawback is that the car rides rather hard.  Comparisons to my deceased �87 Firebird Formula 350 come to mind, though without the attendant squeaks, creaks, groans, cowl shake, rattles, rear axle hop, jolts, and parts clanking to the ground.  The hard ride doesn't bother me personally.  Those looking for more luxury than sport should probably drive one first to see if he or she can live with it.

One thing that should be mentioned here is that there's, uh, political issues.  To put it bluntly, I may as well etch "if you're a loser unhappy with your life here is the symbolic embodiment of your position which is of course in no way your own fault.  Please tailgate me and then fly into a pointless and dangerous rage after I respond by leaving you sucking on exhaust fumes inside the fat pig SUV for which you paid more than I paid for this car.  Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day" on the back window glass.  

Believe it or not, women are, by far, the worst in this regard.  Not exactly the sort of female attention I envisioned when I bought the thing to be sure!  I think VW should do a commercial on this, like the one where the subject character is hustled into a menacing van by bad guys or the one where he is presumably mauled to death by a massive mob of school children because his new Volkswagen looks so expensive.

Aside from that, a couple minor issues.  On a car just filled to the brim with thoughtful little touches, what's up with those cup holders?  I think the only thing that actually would fit are those little Styrofoam coffee cups they give you at the police station or hospital, probably a good thing if I keep it up with the soccer moms.  

There's no remote control for the trunk (even on the keyless entry system), rather annoying because, being a firm believer in no loose objects in a moving car, I use my trunk a lot.  On a positive note, the trunk is hooked into the central locking system and has neat hold down straps in the floor.

A fantastic automobile, but not for everyone.  If you're not a true enthusiast, you'd be better off elsewhere.  You'd more likely than not find the ride too harsh and the car too sensitive, high strung and macho in general.  Those 4-doors, pretty shape, and aromatic Nappa leather are extremely misleading in that sense.  

The particular M3 I bought was purchased by its original owner for his wife.  She wasn't too crazy about it and only put 18k on the odometer in 4 years.  Buy a 328i with a sport package instead, which is the same basic car without the BMW's equivalent of BW-3 "blazin" sauce poured on it. It's a bit cheaper too.  

As to enthusiasts, it's like highway robbery.  I paid $28,000 for mine and it's in (no exaggeration) brand new condition with only 22,000 miles at purchase.  That's about the price of a new but inferior Passat GLX, and only about $3k more than a dull vanilla Camry.  Plenty more just like it are out there as we speak.  Get yours today!!!

4.5 out of 5 stars (� point deduction comes solely from lack of overdrive gear in transmission).
