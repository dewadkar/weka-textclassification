            In 1994, the new model of the Camaro was issued and I was in line with everyone else to buy one. Corvette's are my favorite automobiles of all time, so to see a cheaper version of the vette in a lower-scale version was a dream come true.

I bought my polo green 1994 Camaro brand new. It was beautiful: metallic green exterior, charcoal green interior, v-6 engine. I was a senior in high school and it was the ultimate single-person car.

I drove the car for four years, until I graduated from college and moved on to bigger and better things. For the most part, the car drove like a dream. 

I changed the oil regularly and rotated the tires when I was supposed to. It wasn't until about the fourth year of ownership that I started having some problems with the car. Most of them were minor, but a couple warranted more attention.

Not to sound picky or anything, but the trunk space was a big complaint of mine. It was impossible to pack any amount of luggage into that tiny compartment. I always had to put the back seat down if I ever wanted to take a road trip. Also, the windshield wipers never worked right. They were so noisy and they hardly ever did their job correctly.

The front of the car is longer than other cars too, because it was considerably more difficult to park than other cars I have driven. Another minor problem I had was that the &quot;pick-up&quot; was slow. It's not like I was racing people at stoplights, but the point is if I had wanted to I wouldn't have been able to. Stepping on the gas after coming to a complete stop, felt like I was towing a trailer behind my car. 

A major problem that I had with the car, was the ABS system. In the beginning it worked great. My brakes were a little touchier than I would have liked, especially in the rain, but that was better than the opposite effect. For some reason, however, after the third year my ABS started malfunctioning for some unknown reason. 

I took the car to Chevrolet and they told me I had to replace the system. They said it was a &quot;rare&quot; problem. I could either have it disconnected (which meant no ABS at all) or I could have it replaced. I chose to have it replaced which cost me a whopping $800. 

For the most part the Camaro was a great little sports car. It's perfect for a single person with an average amount of income. The insurance is a bit higher than other cars, but is expected with a sports car. The safety features were top-notch and the ride was fairly smooth. 

It seemed like that once the warranty ran out the problems started occurring. Maybe that was a coincidence and maybe it wasn't. I just know that I enjoyed the first three years of the car a lot better than the fourth year. I sold it after that fourth year and bought a Pontiac Grand Prix, which I absolutely love. Yes, I love it more than the Camaro--but that's another review. :)<br><br>
