            This car's handling characteristics are superb and on par with the base level BMWs, believe it or not, making it an absolute pleasure to drive.  One of the few cars I've owned that is not a chore to drive.

While the 'Zetec' 2.0 liter 4-cylinder zips right along when mated with the 5 speed manual transmission, spring for the available 2.5 liter V6 'Duratec' motor with the automatic or, preferably, the 5 speed manual transmission.  I obtain an average of 27.6 MPG during my 80 mile daily commute which is not too shabby for a V6 powered vehicle.

The Duratec is a DOHC (2 over each cylinder bank = 4 cams total) design 60 degree V6 tour-de-force.  A great motor with the exception of the waterpump impeller, which I can best describe as being made of cardboard and impregnated with plastic for 'strength'.  Either keep your eye on the temp guage or have the unit replaced with one having a metal impeller.  DO NOT drive this car when the waterpump fails (and it WILL) and the temp heads to the red.  You risk serious engine damage and pronto.  Pull over, shut 'er down and call a tow truck.

That being said, everything else in the car works as advertised.  Available 4 wheel disc brakes with 4 wheel ABS bring the car to rest in a more than adequate fashion.  The traction control is nice, but works by applying braking action the the drive wheel that is slipping.  A nice limited-slip differential would have been better, but let's keep in mind that this car LOADED and new was $20k or less.  A bargain.

The HVAC system is first rate.  The 8 way power driver's seat is very good, and driver's comfort is good. (I'm 6 feet tall.)  Very tall folks (6'2"+) may complain of lack of driver's legroom.  Back seat legroom is a joke.  OK for kids 13 and under, but uncomfortable for adults, young and old.  Split 60/40 fold-down rear seats with latches that open FROM WITHIN THE TRUNK are a nice touch.  The trunk is designed for very-low liftover, which is a major bonus for shorter folks or just folks like me who do not enjoy lifting groceries.

Car is functionally the came as its sister cars, the Ford Contour and the (international) Ford Mondeo (1st Generation.)  As such, there were a few expensive recalls.  One such recall is the potential need for replacement of the catalytic converters.  (There are three - one each 'pre-cat' located at the bottom of each exhaust manifold and the 'main' catalyst located further back in the exhaust stream.)  It may be wise to find a vehicle that this recall has been performed on, or you may end up fighting an intermittent 'check engine light' as the emissions system fights to keep itself in tune.  There is no easy way to tell if this 'recall/replacement' has been done, but most Ford dealers that performed the recall were kind enough to put a sticker on the air filter housing indicating the recall was performed and when.  Look for it.

This vehicle is a 4-door only.
