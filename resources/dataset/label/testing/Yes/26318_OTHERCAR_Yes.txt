            I'll preface this opinion by saying - I own a 2000 Honda Civic SI.  This is the highest trim level civic you can get with a sportier suspension and a 160 HP VTEC engine.

This is one of the most stolen vehicles in America and I have felt that wrath.  In one year of ownership there have been 6 theft attempts on my car.  4 times someone tried to pry a door or push down a window and set off the alarm.  Once they got under the hood and were 1 step away from driving off with it and the most severe instance occurred when the alarm was disabled, the car was put on jacks and the rims and tires were stolen.  BUT, they've never managed to steal it.  (alarm, lojack and the club).

My only other complaint on the Si is the 160 hp.... technically its there, but only after you hit 5500 rpm and the VTEC kicks in.  The engine howls, the power is there and you'll get a lot of looks.  But there isn't much low end torque so right off the line you don't exactly get the feeling that there's power to spare.  160 HP, yes... but don't be deceived.

Sometimes you want to drive w/o being noticed.  Thats when I don't like that loud VTEC I have to use if I want to get some power - but for me thats less often...

This car is incredibly fun to drive.  The 5 spd is smooth, the suspension is tight, it revs to high heaven and when that VTEC kicks in it makes an awesome sound.

You also get Honda reliability.  A great color (electron blue), standard 6 speaker/cd stereo and a sunroof.  Plus the gas mileage of a little 1.6 liter engine.
