            I use this camera on a daily basis mainly for candid shots.  I was not looking for a professional camera, nor did I want to pay anywhere near what is expected for a higher end camera.  I got everything I was looking for out of the Kodak DX3500.  I received it in the mail from an online discount shop and was eager to try it out.  It is very easy to use.  Here is what I have found:  The software bundled with it is extremely easy to use.  So easy in fact, that anyone that doesn't even know how to use a computer could figure it out.  You put it in, select the install, and it does everything else.  The transfer of pictures from the camera to the computer was very fast, and the quality was very good.  All you need to do is hook the camera up to the computer, and after you select which pictures (or all) you want, it does the rest.  The pictures are great.  I only use the camera on the best resolution, as I don't believe the good resolution isn't good enough when you want to make your pictures larger.  The camera is easy to use.  The menus make it a pleasant experience.  I will tell you of the main cons that I found with this camera, as people usually care to hear about that more often:

CONS:  
1.  The placement of the lens.  It is in a bad spot, and I find that I have a harder time holding the camera.  It is an annoyance, but not so much that I would return it.

2.  I find that there is a delay between pushing the button and the picture actually being taken.

3.  The flash is bright in close up situations.  It is a good flash, but if you are close up, it tends to make things pretty bright.

4.  The review of the pictures isn't very quick.

5.  No optical zoom

You get your money's worth out of this camera.  It is cheap, and takes very good pictures.
