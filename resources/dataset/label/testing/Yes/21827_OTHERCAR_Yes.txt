            In considering a near luxury car, I looked at BMW (3 series), the Acura TL & TL-S, the new A4, VW Passat, the new ES300, and the 2002 Maxima was my winner.  I think all of these are very good cars, but the higher equipment level offered in the Maxima makes it a very compelling buy.  I know that a redesign is just around the corner, but for those in the market now, this is an extremely capable and satisfying vehicle.

Engine acceleration is terrific.  I was used to big HP (traded in my '99 Silverado with the 5.3L 270 HP V-8), but the performance and speed of this car is captiving!  I was seriously considering the Passat, but I wanted automatic, and even with the better VW tiptronic system, the VW is not as quick a car, giving the Maxima at least 2 seconds better in 0-60 times. 

The car is extremely well assembled.  All of the interior materials are very classly feeling, and the leather seats are suitable for your nice living room.  (This is why the TL series lost points in my book).  The doors shut with a nice soft thunk, and the trunk is nicely finished as well.  I know that future production is moving to the US, so that too weighed in my mind in considering whether a 2003 redesigned model built in a new factory could be expected to reach the level of finish in the current car.

The features that are standard are clearly superior to others in the class.  Even Lexus considers this a competitor to their new ES300 (consult their comparo website).  The engine alone beats all but the Type S, and the 17" wheels (and not with SUMMER rated tires, Mr. Lexus), ABS, Xenon lights, heated steering wheel, automatic temperature, and 6 disc in dash changer are nice luxury features.  The only minor disadvantages of the Maxima are the lack of a sophisticated AWD/Quattro systems (but the traction control is a plus) and some head curtain type airbags (but you can get seat mounted side airbags).

On the suggestions/minor complaints side of things, the steering wheel controls (left side for the audio/trip computer, right side for the cruise control) are not illuminated, so that will take some memorization on my part.  The trunk, like the new Altima, has the old style hinges, which is disappointing, since the hood at least has struts.   Also, not sure why Nissan doesn't offer free roadside assistance, unless you spring for the Infiniti version.  

All in all, this car is a compelling choice.  It is a time proven and tested design that added a number of significant perks this year to merit strong consideration on your shopping list.  Bonus items such as 3.9% financing will help to seal the deal, which should not stray very far above invoice for this vehicle.
