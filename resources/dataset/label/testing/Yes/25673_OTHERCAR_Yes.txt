            I bought a 1995 used Sentra in late 1997 with 28K miles.  It's loaded with sunroof, alarm, power everything.  I've been so pleased with it, even though I was skeptical, trading in my Toyota Corolla with 120K miles.

Good points:  It handles great in snow.  I feel like I'm in a &quot;luxury&quot; car with arm rest, sun roof, nice ride.  I've driven 20,000 miles in two years cross country and enjoyed every moment - as have my passengers.

Bad points:  The alternator just went out at 67K miles and it cost me $475 at the dealer to replace.  Pretty pricey maintenance - especially after a $600 60K checkup the month before.  I've also replaced the brakes.  But the good news is the timing chain does not need to be replaced as it does in other cars like the Toyota Corolla.  

As others have mentioned, the pick up is not great, which means the slow lane in hills on the highway (sometimes the semi trucks even pass you!).

Fortunately, my dealer gives free loaners when my car's in the shop - usually a Sentra with 80-120K miles on it and they drive great, too.  With performance like this, I'll drive it at least another 60,000 miles for sure.  <br><br>
