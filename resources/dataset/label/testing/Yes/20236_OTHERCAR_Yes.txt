            The new Chevrolet Malibu is a family sedan for people like me who hate family sedans. It offers the convenience of four doors without the &quot;boxy&quot; look; the model with the rear spoiler is particularly sporty.

The Malibu is comfortable, roomy and handles like its more expensive European counterparts. The steering and suspension are direct, with none of that mushy feeling on the road. It's nicely powered as well; when you step on the gas, this car moves! Personally, I think they've done a far better job with this car than the Alero, which I've driven. It handles better, is more comfortable and is easier on gas. 

The Malibu is available with all the toys at a relatively modest price: fully equipped with leather interior, sun roof and a CD sound system in the low to mid twenties in Canada. In my  opinion, the Malibu is proof that American car manufacturers CAN build a car to compete with Japanese and European family sedans and I hope we will see more such cars in the future.
