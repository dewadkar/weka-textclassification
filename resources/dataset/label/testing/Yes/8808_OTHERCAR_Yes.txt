            I bought this vehicle because it was the best overall value for my $$$.
I priced out Passats &amp; Maximas with the same options. They both came with price tags well above the Accord's. A Maxima GLE with all of the bells and
whistles would cost at least $26+. I test drove one and the ride quality was not as good as the Accord. The Passat would cost at least $27.5+. Now, when you take all of that into consideration, you have to look at the Accord EX V6. Loaded with an added spoiler for under $24K?? It was an easy decision. Also, new on the 2001 EX V6 is Traction Control and a 6CD in dash system.
What I love about the car is it is a Honda. It is the benchmark. It is the best selling car in America. It is built in America. It has resale value and reliability above all other cars in its class. THEN, add to that a V6 that develops 200hp and is a pure joy to drive. What do you get?
The 2001 Honda Accord EX V6. 
If I had to hate something about the car, it's that 16&quot; wheels only come on the EX V6 Coupe, not the sedan. I think that by Honda dressing this car up with 16/17&quot; wheels, it would cut into some of the sales of the Maxima. That would separate the everyday reliable-looking sedan and add
a sporty image to the Accord.
To drive this vehicle is a joy. Whether your running up the street to the grocery store or down the highway at 120MPH.
Those who should look to buy this vehicle are one's who are currently looking for a sporty V6 sedan (Maxima or Passat)at a REASONABLY price!
One can't help but to look at the pricetag of a loaded Accord and compare it to similar Maximas or Passats. When one gets up over $26k for a car,they should start looking toward Audi,Volvo, Acura and Infiniti.
Those who shouldn't buy this car are one's who don't value the almighty dollar. I can think of a lot of things to do with an extra $3-4K. Can you? And that's with receiving performance,reliability,and all of the extras.
