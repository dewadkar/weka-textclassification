            This is actually the 2nd explorer I've owned now. The first was a '98 XLT model loaded that I was very pleased with - there were NO problems with it, I just traded in and upgraded because the 1st was getting on in miles and I was interested in having as close to a luxury SUV as I could without paying the luxury price.

Pulled into the dealer and spotted a gorgeous black 2000 Explorer Limited and took it for a test drive. (The rest is history)  :) - it's features include:

-6 way power driver & passenger seat (memory on drivers seat) and <b>heated</b> front seats [excellent feature for New England winters].

-Power windows, door locks, steering, and brakes.

-Cruise control, tilt wheel, power moonroof, trailer towing package, multi-disc CD changer and Mach audio system with am/fm, cassette and CD.

-Leather interior with wood grain detailing

-Anti-lock brakes, 21 gallon gas tank, 4.10 axle ratio, front and side airbags, reverse sensing system, floor console message center, security system, memo recorder and 2 garage door opening device on drivers sun visor.

There's still plenty more as it's equipped with every option available but these are the things that stand out in my mind.

The sticker price including destination & delivery charges was $36,805.00 - which some people gasped at when I told them. But my logic is, I have essentially a luxury SUV now (minus the name of course) and I paid a minimum of $20,000 less than a similarly equipped Mercedes, Lexus, etc..

My experiences with Ford and this Explorer? Great! I feel totally pampered in my car, especially on a cold snowy day when there's already a few inches of snow on the ground. I hop in the car, click on my seat warmer, pop it into full time 4 wheel drive mode and cruise comfortably where ever I want to go. I've never had a true problem with the car (or the last explorer I owned).

I do however have one "issue". With the moonroof there is noticeably less headroom in the front seats than in the '98 model with no moonroof. I'm 6' tall and find my head skimming the top on certain bumps if I'm sitting straight up. If this car didn't have the moonroof I'd keep it forever..

I truly love this car, the 4 wheel drive system and anti-lock brakes are outstanding. My neighborhood is easily the most extreme area I drive in the snow, [it doesn't get plowed as well or as often as other areas]and it's very hilly and has plenty of curving areas and steep inclines (my driveway included) - and I have never had an issue getting anywhere I want to go regardless of road conditions. My friends and family all drive regular cars with either front, rear or all wheel drive - and there have been 3 snowstorms here since I've owned this car that I have been the only vehicle (minus the guy who plows my driveway) who made it up to the garage.

The sticker claims 16mpg city and 20mpg highway - my guesstimate is more like 2-3mpg less than that on average, which I have no problem with considering the fact that this is a large vehicle with virtually no aerodynamic or weight saving qualities.

The 4.0 liter engine is sufficient, the car can get out of it's own way well enough but certainly doesn't give you the impression you're sitting over a mountain of power either. I believe my car is rated at 210 horsepower - personally, I wouldn't mind 20 or so more ponies under the hood just for quicker passing.

Handling is fine for what it is (a big land ark) as long as it's treated as such. I was driving a '96 Mustang GT before I got the Explorer so there WAS a learning curve. If you've never driven an SUV take it EASY and get to know the car, it definitely takes some getting used to.

It's very easy to take the mechanical features for granted because they spoil you and the 'getting used to it' period is rather short. But the options are what make this beauty sing! I've never seriously used the memo recorder on the drivers' side sun visor, but the programable garage door openers are an excellent feature. The space they save (and eyesore removal of normal garage door openers) is very nice. The console message center is also great to have - it displays how many miles until empty for gas, oil condition, electrical system status, washer fluid status, miles driven, average miles per gallon and even tells you when it's time to change the oil [the first time <b>that</b> popped up, it really freaked me out!]

Overall, it's an excellent vehicle, it's serving all my needs in an automobile very well. If you're on the tall side, try to get one without the moon roof though..
