            I have a 1993 Nissan Sentra XE and I have to say, overall, I love my little car.  It is the first car I have ever owned; I bought it new in the summer of 1993.  It was cheap, had good gas mileage (now it gets about 23 mpg in the city) and my family has had great success with Nissans.  It has had some minor problems, the most significant being a chronically leaking trunk (the source of the leak remains a mystery to this day).  The exhaust and brakes need regular repair.  I have replaced the rear exhaust (everything behind the catalytic converter) three or four times and the brakes twice.  Even living in the Great Lakes snow belt and driving regularly on salty roads, I feel this is a bit excessive.  But since there have been no great problems (with one exception, see below), I believe this is a great car, easy and inexpensive to maintain.  But this isn't the whole story about my car.  The big problem that I had with my little Sentra had to do with the evil, vicious and pernicious demon who, for seven months, tried to wrest my little car from me.  Let me elaborate.

October 1998
My exhaust goes, rear of the catalytic converter.  I sure am glad I have a warranty on the muffler from Munro.  Within two weeks, as I come to a stop at the bottom of an exit ramp, I hear the musical grinding of my brakes.  &quot;New calipers!&quot; shouts Dean at Munro.  He's happy to see me again.  I sure am glad I have a warranty on my calipers from Munro.

November 1998
Driving home on Lake Avenue in Rochester, NY, I notice that the car ahead of me kicks up some debris from the road.  It looks like glass.  Happiness that his tires, not mine, met that unhappy bottle.  As I glide into the left turn lane and signal for the turn home, my car gives a stoic BLINK...BLINK..BLINKBLINKBLINK.  A nervous blinker?  On my car?  A dead bulb, I deduce.  I arrive home and park, turning on the signal again to find the dead bulb.  And, lo!  I do need a new bulb.  And a new lamp, for nestled in the light fixture is a weight from a fishing line!  The bit of debris I saw fly on Lake Ave. was a piece of my own little car.  Sadness.

December 1998
On an abysmally cold night, I drive home.  While taking a gentle curve, I brush the curb.  My car is not warmed up yet, the rubber on the Michelin tires is stiff.  The sidewall of my tire explodes with great verve.  And of course I can't change the tire because the spare I keep in my leaky trunk (see above) is, of course, frozen to the bottom of my car.  On the up side, I meet a Rochester Police officer who works the evidence collection unit and wishes for the good old days when Arthur Shawcross (serial killer and local celebrity) was still on the loose in Rochester.  Now those were crime scenes!  What is wrong with my car?!

January 1999
Having been summoned to serve a month on Grand Jury, my commute is much shorter.  I can stop in downtown now instead of just passing through.  On my way to the county courthouse, the exhaust falls off of my car.  This time forward of the catalytic converter.  At least I get to listen to the testimony of the nice cop who helped me in December (he didn't mention Mr. Shawcross).  I have never had so much trouble with this car.  By now, I'm fairly sure there is something strange going on.

February 1999
Rochester is beset by a cold and snowy winter. The roads are icy and as I brake behind a school bus at a railroad crossing, I slide right into its bumper.  My other lamp is displaced by the small dent in my right fender.  Now at least my light fixtures are somewhat symmetrical again.  Okay.  There is definitely something up.  I know my car is cursed.  Or possessed.

March 1999
I have a friend who is a pagan priest.  We see each other weekly while we do role playing games.  He knows all about my car.  I know there is a demon in it.  I ask him to bless my little car and he does.

April 1999
Two weeks after the blessing, on my drive to work, I notice that my radio isn't working right.  The digital display is very screwy, then blank and it's awfully quiet.  It won't play tapes.  I turn onto the final road to work and stop at a stop sign.  As I press the accelerator my car crawls feebly forward but can't quite make it through the intersection. Remembering that I drive with my headlights on, I try switching them off and my little car SURGES forward.  We make it to the parking lot just in time for my little car to quietly die.  There is no reviving it.  Later that day I am informed that my alternator has died.  Now I am convinced.  It was a demon.  It fought the exorcism bravely and it its last dying throes declared &quot;If I can't have this little car, no one may!&quot;  The good thing about demons is that they have no automotive smarts.  It has no idea that alternators are replaceable.

It is now January 2001.  My little car is back to it's routine maintenance needs.  We just got a new muffler.  That's the first repair I've needed since the demon was expelled.  I love my little car.

I recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable, low maintenance auto.  I would be happy to buy a Sentra or any Nissan product again someday.  As long as it comes with a Demon Protection System.<br><br>
