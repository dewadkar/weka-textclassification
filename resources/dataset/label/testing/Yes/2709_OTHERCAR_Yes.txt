            I have a 1995 Z71 that has been a dream to own.  It�s actually my father�s but he has been kind enough to let me drive it some.  It�s huge.  It has a terrific engine�and it drinks gas like it�s going out of style.  But, I have had more fun in the truck.  Barring some very unusual circumstances, this truck in almost impossible to get stuck.  The 4WD is incredible.  

It has a stock large V8 motor in it that gives off a roar and accelerates quite well for a big vehicle.  The ride is very smooth and it doesn�t bounce like many trucks seem to do.  However, if you are not used to driving a truck like this, it may take a little while to get used to the lean you feel in some hard corners.

The extended cab is must in my book.  The extra dry space has been so helpful to me.  It will allow you to carry so much more and get more use out of your truck.  Mine does not have the third door, but you can bet that next time it will.  It was not available in 1995.  The leather seats have stayed looking really good considering all the wear we have put on them.  The only problems we ever had with the truck has been the CD player that had to be replaced after mysteriously dying.  Luckily, it was under warranty.

This truck is great for anyone as long as they understand what a mammoth it is.  My mother hates driving it because its �so big�.  I haven�t asked her what she thinks now that she drives that large Escalade.

Personally, I think that the price on trucks is ridiculous.  What can you do?  I highly recommend this vehicle.  I have drive Dodges and Fords and while they are wonderful trucks, too, they lack the appeal for me.
