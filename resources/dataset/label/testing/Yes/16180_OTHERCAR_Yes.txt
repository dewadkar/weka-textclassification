            Wow!  To think Toyota could keep up this trend of truly outstanding vehicles just amazes me.  The engine is much better by comparison to its pre-model, the Previa.  The new Sienna is a v-6 instead of a v-4 like the Previa.  In addition, the interior is very eloquent and has a lot of cup holders, which really helps to make things easy. However the interior is not as spacious as it could be, and with 3 sons it sometimes makes travel a bit difficult, although I still highly recommend this automobile.  Just as an extra, the stereo system is a must have in this car also.  With such a quiet ride sometimes to work, I am very glad I added this luxury.  In addition, the brakes are very efficient and reliable, which just proves once more this is an excellent mini-van.<br><br>
