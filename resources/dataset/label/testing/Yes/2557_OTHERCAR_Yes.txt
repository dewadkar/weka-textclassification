            I purchased my 1999 Pontiac Montana used, and it's been a far better vehicle than my previous mini-van (a 1993 Dodge Caravan LE).  

What most impresses me is the quietness of the engine and the handling.  At times, I've attempted to start the vehicle when it's been running already.  It's that quiet.  Having driven a Dodge Dakota and Ford Expedition, I also like the fact that the Montana rides like a car and not like a truck.  It's smooth whether you're riding up front, or in the rear seat.

I also like the Montana's flexibility.  With seating for eight it accommodates our entire family with room to spare.  The individually folding center seats can be removed, one at a time, very easily.  This allows a great deal of flexibility for storage options.  The seats I also find more comfortable than those in our Caravan.

I also like the look of our Montana - a two-tone maroon upper body with gold lower body.  

The most negative thing I can say about it is that the interior plastic (on the back of the seats, seat belt covers, etc.) is of a very low quality.  A couple of hard kicks from the children and it's bound to crack.  Other than that very minor concern I've been very happy with our Montana.  I would recommend it to anyone.
