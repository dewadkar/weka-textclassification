              When I was looking to replace my car I had driven all through college and my early days in the job force, I naturally gravitated toward the BMW's and Lexus' of the world.  Then one day I happened upon an article in a magazine about this Audi that had 250hp.  I was immediately intrigued about the prospects of such an automobile.  I went to my local Audi dealer convinced I was just there to test drive a few cars including the S4....big mistake.  I was hooked, I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to have it.  Well, as I traveled throughout the Midwest on business the next week I was in constant contact with my dealer working on the details. I finally had my car.
  Needless to say I love this car, it is everything I wanted. It has power, all weather capability, some praticality (although I am glad I am in the driver's seat and not in the back), and it just looks good in an understated way (very clean lines).  
  I love that no one knows what the car is or what is lurking under the hood. I pulled up next to a 2000 Vette at a stoplight, and absolutely left him sitting there.  I love that look you get when they finally catch up, "you have four doors, you haul families, how did you do that?" (Of course, when the Vette is ready and uses its' 350+HP to get you at the next light, but I have three sets of clubs and two friends in the car.)
  For what it gives you it is the best value on the road: power, safety, luxury all for around $40,000....a steal.
  The only problems I have are with the rear seat room, and you better bring your gas card when you buy this car.  Also, I am not happy with the tire wear of the Bridgestone Potenza RE 040's.

I love this car!!
