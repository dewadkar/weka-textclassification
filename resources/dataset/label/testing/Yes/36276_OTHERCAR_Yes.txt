            I recently bought a 98 Corolla and it is astounding.  The car is very comfortable.  I can seat 5 people in my car and because it is compact, i can still manage to parallel park with ease.  I can get about 280 miles per gallon, the record for me being 322 mpg.  It handles great around turns and has both a driver and passenger side airbag.  The only problems with it is that the wheels start squeaking after about 30,000 miles and nothing seems to permanently stop it.  I have experience some difficulty shifting from non-overdrive to overdrive, it just doesn't kick in efficiently enough.  Other than those two minor setbacks, this car is great for a first time buyer or for those who know the dependability and long lasting effects that Toyota can deliver.<br><br>
