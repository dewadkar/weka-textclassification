            I own a '97 Grand Prix, it's hunter green with gray interior.  We originally bought it for my husband, but after having a baby we decided that we would need something bigger for traveling so we sold my car and I started driving the Grand Prix.  We originally bought it because we like the new body style and the handling.  My husband also like the &quot;wider is better&quot; commercials and I think that influenced him.  

It is a great car and although we have had some minor problems and Pontiac service is not the best, I am really glad we bought it.  It gets around great in the Indiana winters and Michigan winters, too! My mom has the same car in Michigan.  

The problems we have had consisted on a headlight that fogged up and the alternator had to be replaced. That was not fun. We had to wait six hours for Pontiac roadside assistance to get a tow truck to us!

This is great family car, but does not have enough room in the trunk for a full size stroller and groceries.  I would by one again!<br><br>
