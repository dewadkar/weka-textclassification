            The sport package was well worth it! The only drawback I've found to this vehicle has been the lack of after-market items to pimp it out... I immediately popped new 20&quot; Niche Bella rims on it and after much web searching I finally found and recently added a new spoiler but have yet to find basics like clear tail lenses or more than one ground effects kit for it. I am considering having the bottom moldings painted to match the cars paint to add two full inches of visual depth to the body. Few friends can even believe its a Lincoln and with the windows down and the system up few elder adults can either. Finally a Gen-X sport luxury sedan that when it's all said and done, the car is bad and that's always good. <br><br>
