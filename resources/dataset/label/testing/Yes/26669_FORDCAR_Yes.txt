            Ms Lima as we call her is a 1995 Ford Escort LX hatchback. She has never broken down on us. But at times I feel as if Im just sitting in traffic as all the other cars pull away from us. If I do try to give her gas she rebels with horrible engine sounds as if saying dont push me Im doing the best I can. The ride is smooth. The A/C is excellent. The automatic seat belts get annoying at times though. The 1.9 engine wasnt strong enough to pull this car I think that all the escorts should have used the 1.8 GT engine that was available at least the 4 doors and wagons. The automatic transmisson also feels slow and clumsy when shifting. I do wish as rear wiper was available-
