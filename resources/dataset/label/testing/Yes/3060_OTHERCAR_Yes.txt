            I bought my intrepid 3 months ago...got it used. I've wanted one since high school and now that i have a real job, i decided to invest my money in one. I chose the Intrepid because its sporty, fast, and roomy.
Plus now that i'm married with a 2 year old daughter, we need the room in the car.
The car itself is awesome. Its quiet, roomy, and highly efficient.
I get nearly 30 miles per gallon, and thats with the 3.5 liter engine.
The engine has dual Holley throttle bodies and a holly main injector.
Plus cold air induction...it'll really get up and go. My high speed so far is 115.
The back seat in the intrepid is unbelievably roomy and comfortable.
The back seat even has AC/Heat vents and shoulder strap seat belts.
The trunk is huge too, right now i have a speaker box (2 12 inch subwoofers), 3 fishing poles, a tackle box, a computer, a bowling ball (better get that out of there huh), and a case of oil...and theres still room.
Its great in the snow and rain, it handles like a dream.
I wouldn't trade it for the world...well...maybe

The car is definately a plus...and they're not that expensive
highly recomended<br><br>
