            I purchased my RAV4 after first reviewing what Consumers Report and Kiplinger's had to say about the model.  My husband and I took it for a test drive and were sold.  My model came with both a CD player and tape deck.  I had to pay extra for undercoating and a keyless entry system.  I live in Virginia and I took it on a trip to upstate NY.  It was great in the snow.  As a matter of fact, I let a friend in Watertown, NY drive it and she now owns one also.  I like the RAV4's size.  I did not need a big SUV, though in the past I had considered purchasing an Explorer.  I also like the way the back door opens, from side to side which makes loading very easy.  I enjoy taking it on trips because it seems to me that it is as comfortable as a car and it handles very nicely.  There are a few things I dislike about it.  It's four cylinder and just not very peppy.  Also, it is not quiet; the road noise can be very irritating.<br><br>
