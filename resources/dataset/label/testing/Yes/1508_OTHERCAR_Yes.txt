              SATURNS are a great car to buy.  We purchased a used Saturn about 4 months ago.  We shopped all over and were disappointed at what our $9,500 would buy.  Either the car had waaaay to many miles OR it was in really poor condition OR it was much more money than we were about to afford.
  Well........we went to a Saturn dealer and SURPRISE!!!  We bought a beautiful 1996 Saturn SL in excellent condition, with only 35,000 miles on it.  We also received a 3 year warranity on it!!  NO kidding!!!
  The service???  You ask..... Couldn't have been better.  We were treated so good.  The prices really aren't up for barter.  They are marked on the car and they are well below what you'd expect.  While you are waiting for your dealer to complete the paper work, you will be taken to a building where you help yourself to coffee, soda, juice, donuts, popcorn etc........
  SO&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you are in the market for a NEW or USED car I'd strongly recommend you check-out a Saturn dealer!!!
