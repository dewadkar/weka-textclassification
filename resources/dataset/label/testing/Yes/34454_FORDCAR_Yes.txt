            I absolutely LOVE my super duty F-250. especially the Navistar-supplied Powerstroke Diesel. 
However the typical Ford dealer has no clue how to fix one.(diesel only)
 fortunately they dont break often.
The truck itself is a marvel, the fit and finish is as good or better than any truck in any class. the regular cab was too small for me, but was roomy and comfortable.
the supercab that I purchased seemed big enough at the time as I was concerned about overall length, but when I  look back I would have rather had the crewcab as my kids got big faster than I thought,the crewcab is not that hard to get used to.
 the v-10 is a powerhouse also and seems to get the same mileage as the underpowered v-8. 
I drove all the full-size trucks,and both types of ford trucks and the superduty is the best. if the dealer service (diesel only) training catches up with the truck Ford will be a unbeatable force.
they are available in base (XL),loaded (XLT), and super-loaded (lariat)<br><br>
