            After turning in our lease on a BMW 5 series with 5 speed transmission, our family looked at Volvo's for a more "family friendly" line of cars.  We test drove the Cross Country (which my wife really wanted) and S80/T6 sedan (which I really wanted).  I was rather disappointed with the fact that both the Cross country and the S80 only came with automatic transmissions, especially after coming off of 5 years of BMWs.  Although, both were awesome cars and I would have been content with either.  

Since I was rather vocal about my disappointment on the automatic transmission, our dealer then introduced me to a "used" 2001 V70 T5 with 5 speed transmission.  This particular car was built for Volvo North America corporate as a demo car, so it was loaded with EVERY single feature, bell and whistle.  I test drove it and bought it on the spot after I returned the car back to the dealer lot!  It had the best features of the Cross Country, being a wagon, but the drive character of a BMW 540i, albeit a bit more mushy than a German car.  This was the perfect combination of a car that I could use for a fun commute every day through the winding hills of rural southwestern Connecticut to the weekend "shleping" with kids, Costco, Home Depot errands, etc.

Snow handling this winter has been excellent with Dunlop Winter Sport M2's through 12" + snow.  Don't think that you necessarily need to have the Cross Country AWD to handle the snow well!

We are also enjoying the extra amenities that Volvo corporate wanted like the GPS, 17" Alloy wheels with Pirelli's, Subwoofer with In-dash CD changer, Integrated Child booster seats, and Grocery bag holder.
