            In November, I traded my 1998 Buick Century for a 2000 model year Century. I use my car for business and drive over 1,400 miles per month. The 1998 model was great; the 2000 model is even better. I have found a slight improvement in gas mileage and in engine performance. The 1998 model was sluggish on acceleration but the 2000 model is slightly better although it still needs improvement. The 2000 model seems a little roomier than the 1998 and I was satisfied with the room in the 1998. Driving my car for business, I can't afford an unreliable vehicle. Neither of my Buicks' has ever required service outside of routine maintenance (oil, lube, etc) which I have performed religiously every 3,000 miles. 

In addition, I have been impressed with Buick's attention to my satisfaction. I am regularly solicited for my feedback by Buick and am treated extremely well by the dealership, Joe Rizza, Orland Park, IL.

One final note. The 1998 Century was the first GM vehicle I have owned and driven for business since 1983. I have been very pleasantly surprised.
