            I purchased a 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse a few days into 1997. Its maiden voyage was a drive from San Diego, CA to Salt Lake City Utah. Temptation struck and I pushed the car to 130MPH on a straight-a-way. While the ride was extremely smooth at lower speeds, things did start to get a little bumpy at 130. Then again, I don't expect that the shocks were optimized for that sort of abuse. 

Since I was living in Utah at the time, the AWD option was very important to me. During the first snow of the season, I took my Eclipse to a large parking lot where I was relatively safe from mishap. I spent a while exploring the car, and found that the car maintained excellent traction in the snow while moving. Braking on the other hand, easily lead to sliding. My vehicle was not equipped with ABS. Later on that winter, I enjoyed driving up snow-laden roads with ease while other cars struggled with traction.

I feel very safe driving the car. There has only been one time, where I lost control of the vehicle. I was going around a rather tight corner on a road that recently been rained on. I didn't think that I was going very fast, but the back tires slid out. Fortunately, no harm befell myself or the car. I have to admit this shook up my confidence a bit. However, since then I've enjoyed whipping around many a high speed corner with no worries.

I enjoy the upgraded sound system of my Eclipse. I do wish that put out a bit more base. However, it was close enough (at least for my taste) to not warrant spending additional money.

I've had a number of minor problems with the car. I believe that Consumer Reports rated this car worst in class for reliability. None of my problems (or the ones typically reported in the survey) were serioues, but a little tedious. Overall, I have received good dealer service and have no regrets about owning this vehicle.

One of the things I really enjoy about the Eclipse is the fact that it is a sports car that is not overly endowed with testosterone. I love the vehicles curves, and the &quot;McDonald's arch&quot; on the back makes for easy spotting in parking lots.

While I love the car, my next car is not going to be an Eclipse or even a Mitsubishi. I'm not terribly excited about what Mitsubishi has done with the Y2K Eclipse. The 3000GT seems to be a dead end. My next (arriving shortly) is a Boxster.
