            The Chevy Silverado is the best truck I've ever driven.  I own a '96 Z-71 extended cab and it is my most prized possession.  The silverado, especially the new ones, are the best looking trucks on the market and the best performing.  My '96 has never had a mechanical problem and it has over 50,000 miles on it.  The silverado handles very well and is a smooth, comfortable ride.  They also have an unbelievable amount of power.  I live in Michigan, and there has never been a snowstorm that has defeated my truck.  It also is as fast as anyone could possibly need it to be.  The only problem with the older models is that the turning radius leaves much to be desired, but that has been fixed on the new trucks, which I have also driven.  The design of the interior of the new model is excelent.  The truck seems to mold around the driver and everything is easily accessable.  The Silverado is for anyone that wants a tough truck that performs, as well as has some style and class.<br><br>
