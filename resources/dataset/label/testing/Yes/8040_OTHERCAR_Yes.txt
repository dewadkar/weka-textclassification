            As a 19 year old girl living in Los Angeles, I desperately needed a car.  My meager budget limited my options.  After traveling to MANY different car lots, I saw this burgundy Saturn for a very reasonable price.  It didn't really attract me because of it's pointy front, but I took it for a test drive anyway.  Wow, was it fun! The comfort was unbelievable and it drove like a dream!

I took it to a mechanic to get checked out, and to my surprise it was in good shape, for the price offered!  I was told that Saturns are very strong and reliable cars.  

Saturns are the only cars that are dent resistant.) They are made of some sort of plastic versus the usual metal in most cars.  I have gotten into two car accidents; did I mention I live in Los Angeles?  My Saturn has kept me safe through both of them, including one on the freeway.

It runs very well, and everything is working great.  The only fault I find is that my two front windows have trouble rolling down all the way.  This, however, was probably caused by the owner before me.  Besides, that minor default, my car takes me where I need to go, safely and comfortably.

The Saturn SL2 is incredibly roomy.  There is plenty of room for your feet and in the back seats. It fits up to 5 people.

The  best thing about this car is the sunroof, which is incredibly pleasant during the hot weather, and fun to look out of at night.

I also really enjoy the automatic seatbelts.  They are a little old-fashioned, but it is a guaranteed safety feature. (It is a plus for lazy or forgetful people).

I recommend a Saturn to virtually anyone that wants a safe, affordable, and comfortable car.<br><br>
