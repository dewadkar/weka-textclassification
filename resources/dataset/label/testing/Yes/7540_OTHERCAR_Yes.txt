                 This is the best thing I have purchased in a long time.  The ability to shoot clear pictures and store them on my computer is just to cool.  I waited far to long to jump into the 21st century, but have now bought an excellent camera to move me forward.
     The Kodak Easy-Share system is so fun and easy to use.  The camera functions just like any point and shoot film camera on the market.  It's controls are very easy to understand, and even easier to use than some older cameras I've had.  
     The memory cards that are available enable you to shoot upward of 300 pictures on a single card.  If you are a traveler, like I am, then you will understand the convenience of being able to shoot hundreds of photograph without ever changing film.  The digital display on the back of the camera give you an excellent view of your pictures immediately after it was taken.  This gives you the ability to ensure you have taken just the right photo.
     Wondering through the onboard menu can be a bit confusing, however, unless you are a picture taking nut you rarely have any reason to alter the standard set up.  You can adjust the shutter time, zoom in digitally, delet pictures, date stamp (or not), set a timer, or review all pictures taken.  
     The best and easiest part of this camera is the optional camera dock (around $70).  Simply place your camera on the dock (it immediately starts charging the battery), push the button and shazam, your pictures are now loaded into your computer.
     You can review your pictures on screen, edit them (the program does an excellent job of editing pictures for you), email pictures to friends or print your pictures at home.  This is a great system.  I even want to add that I dropped my camera from about 4 feet onto the church floor and it only bounced.  The entire camera worked fine.  Lucky, or quality?
     Battery life is poor, especially when using the flash, or on screen display.  I recommend that you save the batteries that came with the camera and use only the rechargeable ones that come with the dock.  When one battery runs low, load in the other set.
     I know that everyone will love owning this Kodak camera.
