            I recently purchased the new Lincoln LS, Millinium addition with the V-8 engine and sports package.  Overall, I am very pleased with the vehicle.  Since it is a new model, it catches many glances as i drive.

The LS appears to be the first American Automobile entry capable of competing with the BMW, SAAB, Volvo, Infinity and Lexus badges.  The feel of the vehicle is very European.  From its BMW-like front end to the extra firm leather seats, it closely competes with the trendier carlines.

Having traded a 97 Seville, the smaller interior did take some getting used to, however, all of the buttons and controls are thoughtfully laid out and easily accessible.  The back seat, however, is woefully small and leg room is limited.  If you are regularly carting four adults, you might want to check another model!

I was surprised that the fuel economy was not as high as I had expected.  The actual economy is very close to the window sticker 17 city 23 highway.  The Cadillac that I traded, with a much larger more powerful engine, scored higher marks on fuel economy.

Overall,  If you are looking at foreign models, check out the LS.  I think it is a great value for the money!<br><br>
