            The BMW 5-series had somewhat of a monopoly over the sporty saloon market. Along came the Jaguar S-type, which is quite a worth opponent.

The first thing you notice about the S-Type is the styling, unconventional but extremely eye-catching. Atleast three months after I had bought the car I still had people starring at it, many trying to find out which car it really was. While some may not instantly like the looks of the car, it gradually grows on you.

I've got the S-Type 4.0 V-8 full options, and boy is it fast. 0-60 mph in under 6.5 seconds and a limited top speed of 160mph. While normal everyday driving wont get your pulse running like a BMW does, when you get to the open road and press down hard on the accelerator the response surpasses that of a BMW. The car automatically senses the driver wants faster acceleration and responds by letting the gears run a little further, before shifting up. And if this not enough there's even a sport mode, which does essentially the same thing. 

This car has a bunch of technology jammed into it, and it would take pages to describe it all. Most of it takes place under the hood, dealing with the engine and suspension. While the Jaguar S-Type doesn't come close the new Mercedes S-Class in terms of sheer gadgets, it does have it's share of which make life comfortable and convenient. Take for example the automated wipers, that automatically switch on when rain is detected and even adjust the speed automatically depending on the intensity. But one of the best features that is becoming standard in more cars today, is the automatic activation of the headlights when the level of light falls below a certain level.

Now on to the interior of the car. In my opinion this is sadly one of the worst sections, and one that really lets down this quite appealing car. The front is quite comfortable and roomy, but the back is cramped at best. If your thinking of fitting two 6-foot people at the back for a long journey, think again. Kids would be best suited to use the back with adults in the front. Compared to the S-Type the BMW 5-series and even the Mercedes E-Class offer substational more leg room in the back.

The full options package comes with leather seats, which are quite supportive but defintely not the most comfortable seats i've sat in. Otherwise on the whole interior is nicely laid out, not too cluttered but the quality of the front console could be improved. The sound system with a 6-cd changer is above average but not good enough to please an audiophile. 

Handling of the car is superb and the ride quality of the car is quite good as well, staying stable and most speeds and situations. Wind noise can be heard at high speeds, but is bearable. 

All in all, the Jaguar S-Type is a competitor that beats the BMW 5-series and rivals in terms of performance, styling and handling but sadly comes short in terms of passenger comfort.
