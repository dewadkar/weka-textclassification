            This is the first car I have ever purchased, though I've had 4 cars, two trucks, and six motorcycles.  Being a rather large person this is the only car I've ever had that I didn't have to have the seat all the way in the rearward position.  Entrance and exit is easy. Though I prefer an automatic shift, this 5 speed is fun, and though I've heard that it is supposed to be underpowered, I couldn't ask for a more responsive vehicle without going to the muscle-car class.  It's tight, cute, and at this point, I'm fully and completely satisfied.  I tend to be rather pragmatic about my transportation, but this car elicits enthusiasm.<br><br>
