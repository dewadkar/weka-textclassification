            Probably not. I have had my Xterra for a little over year - mostly driving around a mid-west town of about 100,000 (ie, not too much traffic).  I have had it off-road only a few times. Does well off-road - a little short of clearance compared to my previous SUV (Dodge Ramcharger w/4" lift kit)...but did well enough once I got a feel for the lower clearance. Good enough power to climb pretty steep hills in 4-low. 

Mileage is good - get around 18 mpg on the road....probably about the best mileage of the SUV's. Have had very few, minor maintenance issues (a fastener in the wheel well came loose, lost one of the two screws that attach the moon roof).   

However, I rented a 2000 Ford Explorer a few weeks back for vacation (flew to Seattle, drove through Oregon and N. Calif and back to Seattle).  Anyhow, the "creature comforts" of the Explorer sort of spoiled my wife and me....back seat air conditioning, overhead sunglass storage, FOLD DOWN THIRD SEAT....

I have also had the opportunity to drive a Durango for a few days this last year - again, the creature comforts were nice. 

Summary - the Xterra is a good vehicle - good value for the money.  But if you need to haul 5 or more people for any length of time and want a few "options" .... and are willing to pay a few $$ more...there are better vehicles out there. We usually keep vehicles around 10 years...we'll probably trade this one in after two for a Explorer or Yukon or the like.
