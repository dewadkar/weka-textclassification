            I first want to say that this is a very, very nice car.  I have only driven it a few times, because my Uncle owns one, but I always look forward to driving it.  My uncles is silver, and while I think it looks ugly on most cars, it fits this one.  When I saw the outside, I was impressed.  But when I got inside, I was blown away.  This car can probably comfortably fit 4 adults.  It is a good family car if you only have two kids.  There is room for a third person in the back seat, but I think it would be cramped with that third person.  The seats are extremely comfortable.  They were very soft and plush.  I didn't change the seat at all, so I'm not sure what changing the position of the seat is like, but it doesn't matter, the seats are so comfy, you'll want to sit in them all day.  The map system is a nice touch for when you get lost (as I frequently do).  The car came with a moonroof and a 6 cd-changer.  These were nice touches.  It made the car trip even more exciting.  The car handles nicely, and at times it was if the car and I shared a brain.  It has good breaks too.  The tinted windows and the configuration of the cup holders are nice additions.  I would have to say that overall, this was a very nice car.  The only problem is the $50,000 price tag.  But, nonetheless, if you are willing to get a nice car for a small group or family, this one is my top choice<br><br>
