            After an extensive search for a new vehicle that included test driving Lexus RX330, Nissan Murano and Chevy Trailblazer, we decided to buy a GMC Envoy SLT, 4 wheel drive with all options except for navigation.  The leather interior is done in two tones and color coordinated with two tones on the dash and interior panels.  Accents include a wood grain look found on higher end cars.  Controls and instrumentation are well placed and easy to access from knobs or from buttons on the steering wheel.  The number of programming options exceeds what we found on most other vehicles.  For example in reverse you can have the passenger side view mirror tilt down or the drivers side view mirror tilt down, or both can tilt down.  And these settings are programmable for each driver.  In addition, you can control lights, door locks, alarm indicators, radio stations and on and on.  Ride is good to excellent.  Not as nice as the Lexus, but lots better than the Murano and Trailblazer.  Amazingly the Envoy has a tighter turning radius than the Lexus, making it really easy to park.  The Envoy has 3 different 4 wheel drive options to choose from.  You can choose all-wheel drive (similar to the Lexus), 4-wheel high and 4-wheel low.  The 4-wheel high and low options keep more wheels spinning for better traction in difficult conditions.  In addition, you can tow 6200lbs versus the Lexus 2000lbs.  The biggest surprises was the Onstar system.  We signed up for the basic service which gives us 100 minutes of airtime across the US with no roaming charges for $39 per year.  Yes that right, per year!  This allowed us to ditch one of our cell phones that was costing us $45/month for a savings of $500/year.  The bottom line is really where this vehicle shines.  It listed for over $40k and we bought it for $32.7k with dealer discounts and rebates.  In contrast, the Lexus dealer offered us $1,200 off the purchase price of $41k.  Lexus always touts their resale value.  That is probably an advantage if you are trading vehicles every few years.  However since we purchase and run our vehicles for 10 years, resale value is really not a factor. We are extremely happy with our Envoy and would recommend it to anyone considering an medium size SUV or crossover vehicle like the RX330 or Murano.
