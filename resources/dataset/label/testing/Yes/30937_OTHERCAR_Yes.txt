            The obvious sleek styling is what first attracted me to the Sebring. I had had a couple of convertibles before, and wanted to &quot;recapture my youth&quot; again! I have a friend who owns a Chrysler dealership, and he convinced me that the Sebring was the car for me. For the most part, he was right. I love the sporty lines, and the way it attracts comments from people - even the kids at my high school! I can have the top down for about 7 months here in Canada, and I love the feeling of driving with it down. There's lots of get-up-and-go, even with the automatic, and the overdrive supplies more than enough power when needed. The bucket seats are very comfortable, and no-one has complained about the back seats, and my 2 boys are both 6'4&quot;! There's plenty of trunk space for 4 sets of golf clubs, shoes, etc.

So what's not to like, you ask? The brakes have been an ongoing problem. The drums/rotors have been serviced 3 times in the first 2 years, as they wear very quickly and unevenly. I've had the power top bled 3 times, as an air lock develops which makes it very slow to put up. I've been caught in the rain more than once! Because of the inswept shape of the doors, you get wet when it rains every time you open the door or window. The stereo system is excellent, but the speakers in the doors are too much for the hardware of the door to handle with lots of base. Try as they might, the dealer has been unable to get rid of the rattle - and I like lots of base! There's been a couple of other minor things as well. Everything has been repaired on warranty, but I don't like the number of trips to the dealer that I've had to make when you spend this much for a car.

Would I buy another one? My friend the dealer assures me that the other convertibles have not had the same trouble as I have, and I tend to believe him. The car still looks like new, and I love the admiring looks I get when the top's down. Unless I could find as good looking a car, in the same price range, I would definately buy another. <br><br>
