            My brother owned a '92 Beretta GT. It was a pretty powerful and nice looking little car.  It was a little beat up so he let me have it  because he knew i could fix it up. It didn't need much body work because it was a southern car, but the engine was a little beat and the interior needed work. I buffed it, replaced a few parts and I was on my way.  I was very surprised with the power this little Chevy had. The GT had the 3.1 liter V6 and it had a standard transmission. This little car could really pick up.

This car's engine was a little beat up. It already had 110,000 miles on it, and it went to about 160,000 before major things started breaking. The life of this car was unbeleivable. It was used as a sort of a race car against some friends, they had Cameros and Monte Carlos SS's and they beat the Beretta, i wont kid you about that, but it was fun trying to keep up. The Beretta would keep up at first but then get blown away. It was still a fun experience.

I also like the looks of the Beretta. It has a love it/ hate it look but i happened to like it. After I shined it up it was a very nice looking car.  It had a Le Bra on the front and i took that off, the paint was very beat up under it so i patched it up and polished it, it looked like new. The versatillity of the paint was shocking to me.

One thing i didnt like about this car was how plain the interior was. It lacked some style and it seemed a bit too plain. The seating was a little too tight where it felt like you were shoulder to shoulder with the passenger. 

Another thing was the clutch was very tight. After a few hours of strait driving your foot and leg would be very sore.  Also the shifting was a bit rough. My transmission was fairly new and it would be hard to get into reverse or sometimes would even grind. It may have been whoever put it in for my brother's fault but it was still a rough ride. 

I recommend this car to young kids without a lot of money but still want power. The Beretta would be a perfect first car.<br><br>
