            The dodge neon has to be one of the most often seen cars. You can not go out and not encounter a neon on the road. Perhaps it's the price that attracts so many buyers. I must admit, the price is good and keeping the price in mind, I think it's a good buy.

The neon is a pleasant looking car. It's small and fits almost anywhere but it has a nice exterior too. I do not especially like driving it because it is louder that most cars I have driven and it handles like a shopping cart. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect and flawless and considering how much we bought it for, I think it was a good deal. It does the job. 

As for maintenance, it requires some service but it's not in the shop more often that it is in the garage. If taken care of, it still ends up being a good buy. I don't expect it to last forever but we hope to get a few years out of it before we can move on to something better. 

The dodge neon is a good economy car. If you want a quiet, comfortable, spacious and luxurious ride, this is not the car for you. But if you need something to get you from point A to point B, consider the neon.<br><br>
