            In 1993, my husband and I, who always wanted a Jeep Wrangler, began the search.

We live in the snow on a dirt road and needed another 4-wheel drive.  

We went to our local dealer and let them know where we found one.  They got us a lower loan and even lowered the price $500.00.

We got a red Wrangler.  Red has always seemed to bring us luck.  

We have done our PM's and have over 60,000 miles on our Wrangler and have never, ever, had a mechanical problem with it.

The only problem with a Sports Utility, and especially a Wrangler is, you must take turns slower and you can't go fast.  

It has been a very reliable and dependable vehicle for us and we only own Dodge, Jeep's and Ram's all made by Dodge.  

It isn't a family car and unless you need it for off road driving I would suggest a Neon.
