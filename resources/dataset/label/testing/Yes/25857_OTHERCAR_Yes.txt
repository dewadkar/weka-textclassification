            I got my hands on a Jeep Cherokee in August '99 as they were pushing the 2000 and the lease on my Grand Cherokee Laredo was about the expire.  I didn't want a high monthly payment, and living in upstate New York, I wanted something reliable when the bad weather hits.  I also needed something to get me back and forth, but also into the Adirondacks where I spend time skiing and hanging out in the summer.

So far, I&quot;ve enjoyed my new Jeep and do have something to compare it since I had the Grand Cherokee Laredo for 3 years.  Note that I took the CD option and always am a fan of the Blaupunk addition w/speakers.

It's not as roomy as the Grand Cherokee Laredo, but at this point, room isn't an issue.  It also rides a little more &quot;truck-like&quot; than the other car and it times it's a bit bumpy for my liking.  One other negative is the sound.  When I&quot;m by myself I don't notice it, but when I have others in it with me, I can barely hear conversation or music over the local driving, particularly when I'm stopped and it's idling.

As for the positives, I feel &quot;super safe&quot; in a snowstorm like today and feel like it's got plenty of room for loading up.  I love my jeep, but next time might go for something that provides a smoother ride.<br><br>
