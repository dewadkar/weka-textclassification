            My previous car was an import and I drove that for 5 years.  Living in Canada I really wanted a change so I went for an SUV.  (Ironically, today was our first snowstorm of the year and am I glad that I got this car.)  There are a lot of SUVs but I really love the look of this car and the size seems to be just right.  I live pretty close to the core of Toronto and I really did not want a large car for the fear of parking issues.  A good friend of mine, &quot;a mechanic&quot; told me..&quot;All cars have some sort of problems.. ALL CARS, if you like the car JUST get it.  That is what warrantee is all about!&quot;  That helped me a LITTLE, since the Grand Cherokee had a resent redesign with at least a full cycle under its belt, I figure all the common known issues should of been addressed by the 2001 model.  So I went for it!

Exterior:  8.5

There are many great looking SUVs but I think this Grand Cherokee have the perfect styling for me.  One note, considering I went for the Limited I was expecting painted side mirrors.

Interior:  8.0

I guess I am used to the standard from imported cars.  The interior fit and finished is not up to par with comparable import cars.  It definitely gives the consumer choices!  I was hoping for a better-looking dash display.  There are 10 way (Driver) and less for the passenger leather seats.  I like the perspective you get from a SUV, it was a quite a change from my old (lowered) car.  My car has the Infinity-Gold system with 10-disc changer.  My previous car had a system in it but the 140-Watt Infinity System is just awesome.  I will never go back to upgrading my stereo; it must have been a teenager phase.  The steering wheel have buttons that controls the cruise control and stereo, a really great feature that you canï¿½t live without.  The Grand Cherokee Ltd. came with a built in car alarm.  The alarm features trunk release which is nice.  Not having to install an aftermarket alarm was a bonus for me.  The client control is simply fantastic and easy to use.  Starting from the 2000 model Jeep has introduced duo-client controls.  I love this feature!


Ride:  8.0

The ride is pretty good, fairly quiet.  I did notice some transmission whine when I first drove on the highway.  I only have 5K+ on it and the whine has gone away.  Slight roll on tight turns (Hey it's a SUV).  The V8 engine is great.  Pretty quick for a car in its size, can't imagine the V6.  I do have a complaint on the gas mileage but I was aware of this when I got the car.  The car has a 20 Gal./80 Litre tank and so far I get about 430-450KM per tank of gas.  Yikes, see you at the pump!


Reliability:  N/A

I have not serviced the car yet.  No real issues to complain about but I'll keep you updated.

Would I recommend this car?  Yeah why not.  Though other SUVs made my decision difficult I really wanted to try something different.  The LEXUS or the BMW SUVs are very nice but the price point, value and looks of the Grand Cherokee Ltd. for me was better suited.  Today while driving through the storm this car displayed confidence and perfect posture.  I am happy with my choice.
