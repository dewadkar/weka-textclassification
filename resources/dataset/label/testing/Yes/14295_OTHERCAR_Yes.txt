            I bought my Intel digital camera about 2-3 years ago because I wanted a something cheap to learn on and mess around with. I have yet to encounter a problem and it's relatively cheap in terms of digital cameras ($99).

<b>APPEARANCE</b>

It's not the most attractive camera, but it gets the job done. I think it only comes in one color (silver with dark blue). It's very user friendly, there's an easy to use screen on the top of the camera to switch modes, flash etc.

<b>FEATURES</b>
<i>These may not be the correct/same terms found in the handbook that comes with the camera...</i>

SNAPSHOT - normal picture taking, just like you would take a picture with any other camera

HIGH QUALITY SNAPSHOT - just like a regular snapshot, but a bigger resolution and more pixels meaning a clearer picture(although I can't really tell a huge difference)

SUPER HIGH QUALITY SNAPSHOT - basically this is the same as the high quality snapshot, but more pixels (again, I can't really tell the quality difference)

MULTIPLE PICTURE SNAPSHOT - this is like the snapshot, but it takes 3 shots all at once, one after the other.

<i>All 4 of these features also have a separate timer option. (meaning there is a regular snapshot where you have to push the button yourself and a timed snapshot where you have 10 seconds before the "shutter" goes off)</i>

VIDEO - self explanatory, it takes surprisingly good video, but it uses a lot of memory.

AUDIO - self explanatory, same as above, good quality, lots of memory

<b>FLASH</b>

NO FLASH - self explanatory

FLASH - like any other normal camera's flash

AUTO FLASH - flashes when needed according to how much light there is

AUTO RED EYE FLASH - flashes many times before taking the picture

RED EYE FLASH - flashes many times before taking the picture

(I don't know the difference between the last 2)

<b>EXTRAS</b>

The camera automatically comes with a USB connector cable and a pivoting stand which stands about 1-1 1/2 inches off a table. It also comes with a hand strap (like most cameras do). There is the option of buying more memory (there's a slot on the side of the camera). There is also a screw hole on the bottom where I think allows you to put the camera on a stand.

If you want something easy without so many confusing options, I would recommend this camera. I would not recommend this camera, however, to anyone who is experienced with digital cameras because it lacks many features that many others have.
