            I had been driving Honda Civics since 1992.  I love the hatchback and the fold-down seats for space, but I wanted to have a bigger &quot;presence&quot; on the road, and more space inside.  I carry a lot of electronic equipment around.  I looked at big SUVs but they were TOO BIG for just me, so I test drove the RAV4 and the Honda CRV.  I realized that the RAV4 handles way better, and the interior layout is much better, than the CRV.  It's also better &quot;finished&quot; inside.. not such a cheapo look and feel.
Since getting the RAV in December 99 I have fallen in love with other aspects of it.  I LOVE having power windows, locks, and steering!  I LOVE sitting up high off the ground!  I LOVE the colors!  I got a &quot;Venetian Red Pearl&quot;, but I've seen other colors, and they're all great!  I got mine used with 11,000 miles on it, and paid around $18k, but the new ones were selling for around $21k without extras, so I think the list prices in the description here in Epinions is a little optimistic, but it's worth every dollar!  It drinks a little more gas than the Civic, but my insurance only went up $22 a year, so I can say I LOVE MY RAV!!!!!<br><br>
