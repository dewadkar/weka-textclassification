            Why did I buy the Daewoo Lanos 3 door hatchback?  Why not?  First of all, I was looking for an economy car, something with no extra bells and whistles.  I was looking for something with good gas mileage, and it�s 34 MPG highway was appealing.  It had plenty of interior room for a subcompact car, and was rated high in safety.  I had researched it on line extensively and found more glowing reviews.  The car has been in Europe since 1997, and it has performed well over there where the roads can be even worse than here in the US (Hard to believe with roads in New Jersey).  Combined with dual airbags and anti-submarining seats (I had a Neon where the entire back of the seat broke off in an accident which also submarined), this was one little bargain automobile.

As for looks, Daewoo did choose the best Italian designers!  My sister calls it my half a car due to the rear wheel placement.  In short, it�s cute.

I only paid for two extras, AC and an automatic transmission.  The price was $10,499.00.  Yes, I did compare it with other models, and had considered the Hyundai Accent.  I was getting more for my money.  Daewoo even threw in free service for the first 36,000 miles.  (Just for reference, it is well known that Daewoo made the Pontiac Le Mans for GM, and to tell you the truth, the only parts of that car that didn�t last were the GM parts.  Someone had once mentioned the weld joint on the door failing.  Daewoo bolts their doors on.  That weld was GM�s design!)

The ride is smooth for a small car, (definitely smoother than the more expensive Neon) and the seats feel just right.  There is wind noise because the windows do creep down, and the engine is about as noisy as a Neon�s, but that has to be expected in an econo box.  The steering is, for lack of a better word, precise.  It takes some getting used to.  You will over steer at first, but once you get used to it, it�s a welcome feature.   Lane changes can be done quickly and accurately with just a small twitch of the wheel.  Yes, it will react to a strong wind gust due to it being a light weight car.  Also that precise steering works both ways which I found out with uneven paving on a road; it tends to follow the concrete joint in those cases.

Acceleration is excellent for such a small 102 HP car.  The power button on the gear shift is also a welcome feature when merging on the highways.  It has excellent passenger room in spite of its size.  I had my whole family in there (4 total), seated comfortably, and we�re not small people.  The trunk can hold quite a bit itself.  (If you want the specifications go to www.daewoous.com.)

Recently I got to take the car out in the snow.  For a little car with Korean tires, it handles well.  I've been getting better performance out of those Hankuk tires than I did with the Goodyear tires I had on my Neon originally!

If you want a car that is low-priced, good on gas, fun to drive, and is good looking all at once, this is the car for you.  If you want an luxurious, overpriced piece of junk status symbol, this isn�t for you.<br><br>
