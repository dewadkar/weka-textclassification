            Before leasing my 2000 Explorer Sport, I researched cars and SUVs for over 6 months.  Searching the internet, polling strangers stepping out of vehicles I liked in parking lots, asking friends and co-workers...I drove everyone crazy, but I wanted to make the right choice.  

I come from a &quot;Ford Family&quot; - every vehicle my parents, siblings and I drive are Fords, from the 1928-1931 Model A's my father collects to the Explorers my mother and I now have (brother has an Expedition, Mom wants one!).  I used to drive a 1991 Escort LX - until it caught on fire at 253,000+ miles!!!  This forced me to put my decision on the front burner and do it quickly!

I had been in love with the looks of the 2-door Explorer for a very long time.  I wavered briefly with the ZX2 (what they call the Escort now), the Chevy Cavalier, Saturn SC1 and Pontiac Sunbird.  Then I looked at Jeep Cherokees and Chevys.  But I kept seeing Explorer Sports going by, and they looked so much better.  Driving 27 miles one way to work, I needed a sturdy, safe vehicle in all that traffic.  Enlisting the help of a broker, plus riding in a co-worker's Explorer Sport, I finally got my new &quot;baby&quot;, and a VERY happy and excited about it.

I love the way it handles - VERY responsive.  You put your foot on the gas or turn the steering wheel and you get where you want to be.  It's taller than most cars, and you have great visibility on freeways.  Plus cars don't dart into traffic in front of an SUV very often (they can't tell from the front it's only a 2-door!).  It is comfortable to drive or ride in (though very tall passengers can't get the seat far enough back to accommodate real long legs ultra-comfortably), and the back seat is very roomy for 2-3 people.  Lots of space in back (I carried 12 big boxes of medical records without a problem - or without folding the seat down!)

For just a few dollars' difference per payment over the life of the lease, I opted for the fully-loaded sport package.  I love the CD-plus-tape player (amazing sound plus controls in the back seat), the compass and temperature gauge, the automatic everything - door locks, windows, door lock in the cargo area, the kleenex dispenser, the garage door opener box, the multiple ways to adjust the driver's seat AND lumbar support, cruise control too!!!! - though in traffic you can't use that much), I love the look of the side steps and the wheel lip things - the contrasting color over the wheels look cool.  Can you tell I am in love with my car?  I have never had a brand new car and I am very happy with this one.  I got it new in March 2000.

I know I made the right choice because every time I see my Explorer, I smile and say a silent &quot;Hi&quot; to it.  I see others driving the same model, and I say &quot;look how cute my car is&quot;!  It's big and bold and sturdy, yet not a &quot;Soccer Mom&quot; car with 4 doors and kids and dogs.  It's kind of a &quot;girl car&quot;, being the more petite model, but I just love it!  I feel safe in it, like I won't get crushed like an accordion if someone hits me.  it feels great to drive, I love the gentle roar of the bigger engine!

I just wish the 2001 Explorer Sport (and the Sport Trac - what is THAT about!?) was not so UGLY and HIDEOUSLY BULKY!  If I decide to get a new one at the end of my 2-year lease, I hope Ford has reconsidered the body style!  I hate the new ones - the bumper looks PLASTIC and the whole thing looks CHEAP and thrown-together.  (Ford, hear my plea!)

I give my 2000 2x2 Ford Explorer Sport &quot;2 thumbs up&quot;!!!!
