            2000 Hyundai Accent GL
Hyundai?!?!?  Yes, that is exactly what I said when I first learned that this was the car that I rented for my two thousand plus mile road trip.  But I have to admit; it has been a long time since I looked at this company and I stand corrected.  This vehicle possesses the features of many, more expensive cars, and is actually fun to drive.  With several stupid setbacks (i.e. Ones that could have been remedied with a few dollars by the company) I have no complaints.  So let�s talk about the experience.
First off let us talk about the specs.  A four cylinder, 1.5L SOHC engine that produces 91hp @ 5500RPM is what powered this hog.  It was equipped with dual air bags (STD) and an automatic transmission ($600).  Four-wheel, independent suspension, front wheel disk brakes, and an anti roll stabilizer bar are all standard.  All this info you can get at the Hyundai home page.
But here is the actual driving �experience�.  I have to complain about the radio.  There was no seek button.  When one is away from his/her home and radio stations it does not make sense to flip through all the frequencies to find something you like.  That, and the very confusing fade/balance and tre/base controls pretty much made this radio useless.  Really, how much can that really cost.  And of course the absence of cruise control is the other problem.  How can you drive for hours without cruise control?  But you might wonder why I did like this car?  Well here are few reasons.  60/40 fold-down back seats allow you to fit a lot of stuff, like skis for example.  A very big glove box, intermittent wipers, and just over all simple and well-designed controls add to the charm of this little car.  The head-lights were seemingly ubiquitous, and maybe that�s why the brights appeared to add no additional visual aid.    Handling was surprisingly good.  Although the acceleration was still that of a compact car the road noise was relatively low and the car drove as smoothly at 50mph as at 95mph.  Cornering was also excellent.  Sure, the car had new tires, but I have to give it some props for competently taking all corners that I came across at twice the posted speed limit.  I drove on many mountainous roads (road to Mt. Baker in Washington state just to name one) and I was never disappointed.  Breaking was very reliable when needed, although the pedals require a little getting used to (that is probably due to the fact that I drive bigger cars regularly)
OK did I miss anything?  
I guess I should end by simply saying that this is a great little car, and starting at $9000 with a 100,000 mile warranty you cannot go wrong on a limited budget.
