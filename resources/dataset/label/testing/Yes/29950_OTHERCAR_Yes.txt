                My wife and I were not actively shopping for a new vehicle last February (2000) before we purchased this van. When Chrysler came out with their promotional 0.9% financing program; we considered: with the added comfort level for trips and the ability to have one vehicle excursions more often with more than just one or two of our 9 grandchildren, this was an opportunity we couldn't pass up.
     Ten months later we have put about 4500 miles on our van mostly on trips of from 4 to 10 hours or on short local excursions with several of our grandchildren in tow. We don't use the van for much other local driving except for grocery shopping. We are especially pleased with the very good gas mileage we have achieved, for such a large vehicle, while using unleaded regular gas. The dual sliding rear doors make our excursions with our grandchildren a treat and the spacious cargo room behind the rear seat makes grocery shopping a breeze. The stereo system helps make traveling a pleasure by giving us the options of listening to quality sound from CDs, tapes, and off the air broadcasts.  The dual front comfort controls and rear comfort controls allows everyone to ride at individual comfort preferences. Perhaps the only feature it doesn't have that I would enjoy is a sliding sunroof. Unfortunately, the computer console, mounted in the overhead makes it almost impossible to add this feature, at least for the full enjoyment of the driver or the front passenger.
     Driving this vehicle is real pleasure, the driver's seat has a perspective that provides an excellent range of vision, and gives a real feeling for the control and safety of the vehicle. It handles exceptionally well and the driver related activities and functions are conveniently laid out for easy access.
     I would highly recommend this vehicle for all who are going to frequently drive with more than one passenger or carry clean cargo. It is spacious, comfortable, and has easy accessibility for passengers and cargo. It is not for someone who drives alone. <br><br>
