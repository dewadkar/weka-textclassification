            This is the 3rd toyota truck that I have owned. Toyota's are the first vehicle that I look at when looking for a new vehicle.  They are extremely reliable to say the least.  My truck is a 2001 Tacoma Double-cab 4WD. Engine is very powerful (can only get V6 in double cab), gets good gas mileage (for a compact truck)usually I get about 18 mpg, but on a recent mostly interstate trip I got 21.5 mpg.  I love this truck, and couldn't be happier with it.  If you are considering buying a new truck or need a 4 door truck, but don't really need a full size, check it out. Some say the bench seat in the cab isn't comfortable to ride in for very long, but honestly I don't know because I'm always the one driving.  I think all of the controls are laid out nicely, and I really like the new white faces on the gauges (speedometer, tach, gas,etc) they are much easier to see.
The engine is a 190 hp V6, it has good power and acceleration.  I chose the silver color and really love it.  I can drive 2 or 3 weeks and it looks like I just washed it because you can't see the dirt very well.( I think thats good anyway, I'm not sure).The only thing that I have found is that the vinyl or leather or whatever material that they used for the interior scratches really easy.  For example on the doors and the center console my dogs have left many scratches, and I touched the door with my umbrella and it left a big scratch on the door (inside), but aside from that minor annoyment, I LOVE MY TRUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. hope this helps everyone.
