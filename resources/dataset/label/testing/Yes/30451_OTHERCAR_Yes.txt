            My first SR5 was an '83.  I had that car for over 4 years and never had a problem with it.  I traded it in with 199,000 miles on it and got a great trade-in value.  I loved the car.  When I went to the dealership to purchase the '88 model, I loved it even more.

The dealership treated me like a queen, even though my credit was a bit sketchy at that time.  I purchased the car and drove off the lot.  

I owned that car for over 8 years.  I did all the maintenance myself.  The parts were very reasonable and they were easy to replace.  When a woman ran a red light and totalled it, I cried for days.  I had 165,000 miles on it and it still looked and ran beautifully.  In the eight years I owned the car, I probably spent a total of $1,000 dollars in emergency repairs and your usual maintenance on top of that.  It's important to me that I trust the vehicle I drive and I've never worried that the car would break down on me. 

Since the accident, I've purchased a Nissan.  It has a bigger engine but I don't trust the car and it breaks down on me all the time.  I want my Toyota back!!  I'll never own another kind of car again.

I know I'm supposed to discuss the good and the bad about this car, but honestly, I can't think of anything bad to say.  The body was cute and sporty; the engine was very very reliable, and the upkeep was extremely reasonable.  <br><br>
