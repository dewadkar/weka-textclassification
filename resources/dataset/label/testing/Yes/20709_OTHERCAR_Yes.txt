            This was my first new car.  It was less than $20,000 with all the features I wanted, including a sun-roof and a manual transmission.  It's actually not easy to find manual transmissions anymore.  Honda has some fantastic financing deals available, especially around the 4th of July.  I should also note that all Acuras have the &quot;luxury&quot; package built-in.  

I looked at many other 4-door cars at the same time but none were as comfortable to drive.  The Toyota Camry was a tad too expensive for the options I wanted, as was a new Accord.  One specific feature I wanted was for a human over 5'8&quot; to be able to sit comfortably in the back seat and cars like the Eclipse were out of the question.  I could barely fit my own 5'9&quot; in the front seat of one of those.

One thing I really love about owning this car is actually the service at all the Acura service centers I have visited.  They are always prompt to help, willing to provide as much or as little detail about what they're doing.  I have not had any problems with the car, but the regular maintenance services like oil-change, brake inspections and so on have been a breeze.  They even vacuum and wash the car, which is just nice.

I have driven this car from Northern California to Central Texas, and then back again.  I have not had any problems with it despite these long trips along with my 30-minute commute to and from work everyday.  It is an extremely reliable, well-made car that gets great gas mileage and it's comfortable and (with the stick-shift) fun to drive.

I would recommend this car for anyone.  Singles, couples, families, anyone who has to commute or do a lot of driving, or anyone who just wants a car that looks nice and runs well.<br><br>
