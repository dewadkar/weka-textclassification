            I have owned a 1995 Oldsmobile Achieva for approximately 2 years, we have only had one problem with this car and that was still covered by the warranty and was know to be a common problem in this car. We purchased this car with 54,000 miles on it and now has 68,000 miles on it. this car has the 3.1L V6, which has very smooth, fast acceleration. my only complaint is the brakes when you press them lightly it is not as bad as when you need to slow down in a hurry the car shakes. the interior is a very pleasing sporty styling and the outside lines are GREAT i think it is a very cocky looking car. I bought this vehicle because, i guess you could say it was love at first sight, this car is what i call &quot;fire truck red&quot; it is a gold edition which means that all of the mouldings on the car are gold and there is gold pinstriping. I purchased this car from a rebuilder and it was wrecked, but not totaled, it doesnt have a salvaged title. I hit a deer approximately a year after i bought the car and it really gave me peace of mind knowing how well the car protected my son and me but yet still took the brunt of the force. it has a very good stereo system. the power windows are a bit slow.<br><br>
