            I reviewed the Festiva a year or two ago right here on this site and I thought it was a lot of bang for your buck and I still do!

The old Festiva (which I bought "very well used") is not passing inspections anymore but I ragged it hard for a year and a half and got my $1000 worth out of it. Actually I kept it for a second car so that when I drop my Echo off for maintanence I'd have a "free" loaner to get around in. I also still use it when I have less than clean cargo to haul since I don't care about the interior. 

I had my kids with me one day in the Festiva and as we passed "CarMax", I decided to see if they had a Mazda Protage, but they were fresh out so I got a 2002 Ford Focus w/7000 miles knowing that it took the place of the Aspire which took the place of the Festiva. It was fast and had a great stereo/CD system and looked cool but I later heard that Mazda wasn't making the motor for it so I took it back and asked to try something with a Japanese motor and better manueverability for my Dallas,Tx driving.

It was pouring down rain and I was in a hurry so when I saw the Echo sitting there my mind quickly remembered the 1987 Chevy Nova I owned so many years ago. What a great car that was! It was really a Toyota Corolla in disguise and was oh so nimble and easy to drive in traffic and tight parking lots.

I asked for the test drive and sure enough, it was like dejavue , "was this the ghost of my old Chevy (Toyota) Nova calling me back home?" - The Echo handled much like that Nova, easy to turn, short nose so you can actually get a feel for what's in front of you. It's that sense of security knowing where all 4 sides of your car are and like the Nova it sits you up high. The engine has variable valve timing which means the valves adjust as the engine revs for optimal fuel efficiency and power. It has a 1.5 liter 4 cyl which I've always been partial to since I used to own A KZ750 Spectre inline 4 and I became one with that design years ago.

It is simpicity at it's best too. Manual door locks (no locking your keys inside like I did once with a Chevy Cavalier), Manual seats, but power mirrors would have been better than these manual ones. Every morning I get in, the mirrors are out of adjustment due to other drivers parking too close and brushing up against them as they walk by. 

The Air blows HARD and HOT or COLD depending on the weather, The stereo KICKS AAA and when another driver P's me off, I roll down my window and blast him out with "SUM 41" -"An awesome punk rock band". It really shakes things up! I think it's louder than the Ford Focus Mach 5 system. The interior is really simplistic and space age which is easy to clean too (Lots of plastic...ummmm plaaaasssstiiiic!) Personally I want to see ALL the controls behind a smooth touch panel so you don't have any crevices to collect dust and grime!  

There are lots of cubby holes to put "stuff" in including a slideout tray under the passenger seat! The glove box has an upper and lower compartment, There is a tray running under the steering wheel, 2 vertical storage areas on each side of the wheel, 3 drink holders in the center consule, each door has a pocket, and other misc. places for your goodies. The rear seats fold down so you can put LONG items into the trunk up to the rear of the front seats. Really handy when you have an unexpected payload to haul.

The engine is peppy enough too, I've had mine up to a 100 MPH with more power left. 

It does feel funny when hitting tight corners really fast like you are leaning but I don't let that stop me, I just pretend I'm on a great roller coaster ride and it all falls into perspective.
