            What are you looking for in an SUV?  Size, power under the hood, comfort, safety, luxury? All of these should all matter to you, but ultimately you are looking for an around town vehicle with carpool capabilities.  Very few people use the 4 wheel drive capabilities that SUV's were built for.  Most people are looking for a safe, stylish, family vehicle that has taken the place of the stationwagon.  The size of the '00 Pathfinder is bigger than the previous years, but it is still not as big as the Explorer.  Size ain't everything!!!  Because you are driving around town comfort should be a priority.  There is not, and I repeat there is not, a better driving SUV on the road than the Pathfinder.  The Explorer, no matter how many they sell, drives like a pickup truck. Test drive one for yourself and take a turn at 35 miles an hour and you will be thrown into the passenger side seat.  The Pathfinder is less expensive than the Cherokee so there is no comparison.  If you want the 4 wheel then go for it!!! This is a quick and agile vehicle that is great for off road fun. I love my Pathfinder!!!! Come join me!!!  <br><br>
