            I just bought my 240SX SE a week ago and I love it. I have a white 240SX SE. These cars are not easy to find anymore since Nissan no longer makes them. I had wanted one of these cars a while back but didn't think I could afford one. Well when I went car shopping a week ago I found one and thought why not? So i drove it and loved it. The car turns corners very well. Mine is an automatic and it just takes off (i had a Neon before so the 240SX has alot more power). Just like any 2 door sports car the back seat really doesn't have that much room for people sitting in the back seats. Luckily I am short so whoever sits behind me has room.. ha ha. Oh the seats are bucket seats and I love that. The seats are also comfortable. I also like where the controls are to adjust your outside mirrors.. they are right below the gears shift. Tome that makes life easier when I am driving and trying to adjust my mirrors. It also has a sunroof that slides all the way back or you can tilt it up just to let a little bit of air in the car. The sunroof has 2 controls to do this.. one tilts the sunroof up the other slides it back. That way i know that my sunroof is close all the way in case it rains or something. So that is  wonderful in my opinion. Anyways I love my 1996 Nissan 240SX SE. I finally got my sports car and didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it. My 240 was very affordable!<br><br>
