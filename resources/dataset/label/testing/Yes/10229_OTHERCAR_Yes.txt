            When I went to look for a new car, I had a couple of cars in mind, but I eventually settled down to an Infiniti QX4, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Mercedes ML320 and the Lexus RX300. I immediately scratched the Jeep, after looking into reliability, and talking to a few friends. A nice car, but the price tag can 'grow' over the years. The Mercedes also had similar problems according to my friends, remember it is not made in Germany. So, finally I came down to the QX4 and the RX300. I was looking at used models, a 98 QX4 and a 99 RX300. I drove the QX4 first. A well designed-vehicle but I felt like I was going to tip over after driving it. Plus, it reminded me too much of a Pathfinder, which it is. I had dismissed buying a Pathfinder almost 10 years earlier.

So the RX300 became my choice.

I will only go into the problems, as everything else I love about the car.

Problems:

1) The brakes are quite inferior for this vehicle. I think they just put car brakes on it, probably Camry, since it is based on it. First, thing I did was change the front brakes to something more powerful, Frerodos, a UK brand. Lexus brakes squeak too much, due to a glaze. However, the brakes are very tiny for a vehicle this size.

2) Battery- I frequently get the clock, radio stations and seat selections resetting themselves. This problem has died down though.

3) Lights- The lights are excellent, but changing them requires a trip to a mechanic. Also, see if you can play a game with a friend or your kids called spot the oil filter. You will not believe where they put it.

4) Seats- They are not as comfy as I would like. I am frequently changing seating position. One plus, the leather seats look like leather and feel like leather, but just not enough softness

5) Air- This car is notorious for having a bad odor every so often, due to condensation in the air system. Changing you air filter will not do it. You need to clean this heavily with lysol through the front vents.

6) Tires- Putting $50 tires on an almost $40,000 new vehicle is beyond me. Goodyear Integritys are nice but when they wear out move to Michelin Crosstrains or LTXs. Also, make sure you put your wheelock key in a safe place. My used car did not have the lock, and my dealer could not get it off (we ended up using a blowtorch).

7) Noise- Some people claim there is wind noise due to an aerodynamic fault. I really do not hear it, but though I would mention it, as many of my friends hear it in theirs.
