            <B>Overall:</B> This is a great car and is a blast to drive. The San Marino Red really makes this car stand out.  If this car doesn't stand out for it's sleek design, its 3.0L 200-HP V6 will sure get some attention.  For driving purposes it would be great if they offered this car in Standard but the Automatic makes smooth shifts and has great pick-up from 60 to 70.  The Manufacture lists the gas mileage at 20city/28Highway.  18-19city/25-26Highway is probably closer to the truth, which is still outstanding.  Especially when the price of gas is so <B>HIGH!!!</B> 

<B>Reliability:</B> Honda! Enough said.  This car is guaranteed to last, the 10 year or 100,000 mile power train warranty should ensure that.  I bought mine with just under 16,000 miles on it and it runs like its brand new.  From my experience Honda's, if maintained properly, are some of the most reliable vehicles out on the market.

<B>Seat Comfort:</B> The bucket seats really make your bum quite comfortable.  One of the problems I have is that I can't seem to find a "comfortable" setting.  The seats themselves are very comfortable but I just can't seem to find that perfect setting.  Oh and I'm only 5'8" but there is not a lot of head room.  Sometimes I feel like my head is going to go through the sunroof.  So then I lower the seat and feel like i'm in low rider.  All in All though I am quite happy with the design.  

<B>Quality and Craftsmanship:</B>  The design of the car has you higher off the ground than the Prelude which I think gives you a better line of sight.  I also think that the Accord Coupe looks more like the older models of the Prelude than the current Prelude.  What that has to do with quality and craftsmanship?  Well i'm not too sure but it's my opinion not yours dam**.  :-)  Ok so back to Q&C, the Accord Coupe is a heavy car.  This probably takes away from some of the torque but not much.  On those really windy days you don't have to worry about your car getting blown off the road.  It is a very stable ride and the wider tires definitely provide for better handling.

<B>Roominess:</B>  The car although a Coupe really has a lot of space to fit two people comfortably in the back seat, and possibly a small third person, or maybe a fat narrow person.  :-)  Anyway,  there is ample capacity in the trunk.  The back seats fold down as well to provide even more space if need be.  However,  with the seats down the access is narrow.  You could probably put more in the seats while they are up than you can when they are down.  Although I was able to carry 50 chairs in the Coupe for a graduation event.  I even had enough elbow room to drive the car.  :-)

Well,  I guess in summation I would have no hesitation in recommending this car to a friend or even a nice enemy.  Riding with the sunroof open and the windows down is a constant pleasure.  The 6 speakers in the EX edition are enough to combat the wind.  Although, the 6 X 9's in the back could be helped by more wattage.  One thing you will have to be on the look out for <B><I>DOOR DINGERS!!!</B></I>  This car loves to get hit by others peoples doors or at least that has been my experience.  If you have the option of getting the door panels, I would suggest it.  It might not look as good but it will be well worth the money in the end.  Buy a door later or get the door panels now.  The choice is yours.  :0)  There a lot of options that you can get on this car.  The sunroof and rear spoiler are a must.  Aside from that, the chrome wheels are a really nice touch.  If they give you a choice nix the guard for the sunroof.  It's overkill and makes the car look like an eighty your old grandma should be driving it.  But then again if an eighty year old grandma is driving this car then <B>ROCK ON GRANDMA!!!</B>
