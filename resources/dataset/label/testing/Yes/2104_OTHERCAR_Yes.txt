             � Describe your experience using this product.

When I use this camera it is mainly to take pictures of my friends and special lifetime events that go on like going to parties or other fun functions.  I use it completely in lieu of a normal 35 mm camera and it operates just as easily.  I think its great because on the little screen in the back you can tell if you blinked in the picture, and if you did immediately retake the picture so you dont have to wait to get the film developed to find out that the picture was horrible because you blinked or put your head in a weird position and got a double chin etc....  It is great for that purpose. 

When I try to take pictures of my dogs with it though, is where I found that it isnt so great...they arent the most patient of subjects.  They often will not hold the pose as long as a human so the picture is all a matter of luck!

 � Why did you buy this product?

I got the camera as a gift for graduating from college so I could document my travels after graduation.  It is perfect for that.  I took it with me everywhere and have great quality pictures from everywhere I went.  It was lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so I didnt worry about it at all.  In fact, I had it in my small purse and didnt even remember most of the time because it was so lightweight.

 � What do you love about this product?

Obviously so far you can tell that I love the picture quality, and the lightweight and ease of use.  The camera is great for amateur photography, or just documenting your life.

 � What do you hate?

What I dont like about the camera is that I have had it for a short amount of time and have had to buy the batteries for it 4 times already.  Of course some were completely my fault like for leaving it plugged into my computer overnight so it drained the batteries keeping itself awake, or when it opened the slide front when I didnt have it in a bag in my purse so the camera was just sitting there waiting to take pictures....but just the same it is irritating because the local radio shack doesnt carry the batteries in stock so I have to order them.

The other thing I dont like is the inability to zoom into things really far away.  One night, I saw a picture of the moon that was absolutely amazing and wanted to take a picture of it to use as my background on my monitor.  I took the picture and got it home only to realize that all I had was really sky, the moon was so tiny that you couldnt even tell it was really there.
