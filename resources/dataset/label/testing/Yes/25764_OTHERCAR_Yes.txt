            OK, it's my wife's car ('99 GLS automatic, silver), but I always find excuses to drive it! Everything about this car is a step above our last small car - a '96 Civic. It has a luxury car feel due to the voluminous interior room and excellent fit and finish. The seating position is high, which gives you a better forward view than most small cars -and the windshield is huge, which helps the forward view. There have been millions of positive things said about the New Beetle, so I feel a bit of attention should be paid to the (few) drawbacks.
1. The rear view is severely limited due to extremely wide C-pillars. Coupled with a small rearview mirror, I feel a bit tentative changing lanes. 
2. Sufficient pick-up is not always there, especially when merging onto freeway.
3. Sorry to say it, and I know it is not PC, but it is definitely a &quot;girl's car&quot;. It is just too cute, (especially with a flower in the in-dash flower vase).
Despite the novelty wearing off, the New Beetle is still the most original car on the road under $30,000. I read somewhere that it is &quot;an image car for the rest of us&quot;, and I couldn't agree more. I feel better pulling up to the valet in the Beetle than I do in our Honda Accord.
One last thing, every LA dealer tried to charge above MSRP when we bought ours in March '99, and if you wanted a hard-to-find color, the premium over MSRP increased. A way around this is to buy your Beetle 2 hours to the south in San Diego. I found two different dealers who charged sticker, regardless of the color: City VW and Miramar VW.
