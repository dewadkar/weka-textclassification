            The Jeep Grand Cherokee was the first car I ever owned.  It drove me safely through 2 winters in upstate New York and I never had a single problem with it.  It was sturdy and reliable in heavy snow and rain, yet had the comfort and ride of a luxury vehicle.  I bought it because I heard it was one of the safest SUV's in snow.  The decision was clinched when Jeep had a great sale.  For $299/month and no down payment, I couldn't resist.  Even my hesitant and cautious buying parents couldn't refuse to let me spend my own money on the car. 

There is enough room to move me in and out of two apartments with ease-- and I have a lot of stuff!  It even made the 4 hour treks to and from school pleasant.  It rides smoothly.  I'm not professing that it is a Lexus, but, for a big lumbering, box-like automobile, it's not an unpleasant ride.

Alas, I only had a 2 year lease.  I would have DEFINITELY kept the car if I wasn't moving to a city where cars are not welcome.  It was very sad to part with a car that was as reliable, safe and comfortable as my Jeep.  I drove my parents cars all through high school and many of my friends cars since.  People complain about having their cars serviced all the time.  Except for one oil change and getting gas, I NEVER took my Jeep to the service station.  It is infallible in that respect.  I can say with conviction, that if you live in an area plagued with inclement weather, this is the car for you.  The sleek new Grad Cherokee design that was unveiled last year makes it a good option for southerners as well, but the practicality of 4 wheel drive gets slightly lost in Arizona!  Also, the car eats gas.  Although the tank holds about 20 gallons, I still had to re-fuel about every 200 miles of local driving.  But it was worth it!!<br><br>
