            Previously we owned a 1997 Grand Caravan ES.  It was a great family vehicle.  It had all the bells and whistles.  The comfort and ride were exceptional.  At 70,000 miles, the notorious Chysler problems surfaced.  The last straw was when the transmission disentagrated.  

I was excited about the 2002 Honda Odyssey.  We own a 97 Civic and it has been a faithful work horse.  We have owned  a Odyssey EX-L with Navigation for one year.  We have driven it from Los Angeles to Arizona, Nevada, Oakland and Sacramento.  It currently has 18,000 miles.

The power train is excellent.  The engine is smooth and powerful.  The transmission, although not nearly as seamless has my previous caravan, shifts nicely.  The Magic Seat is so conveinient it has me contemplating selling my little pickup.  Now that we have experienced a vehicle with navigation, it will forever be a must in my family vehicle.

There are three adult drivers in my family.  It is unaminous that the Odyssey is not a comfortable van.  The seats are to firm and the ride can be very harsh on anything but the smoothest L.A. freeway.  Driving to Arizona was pretty exhausting for me, the driver.  It was weird to have no place to comfortably place your left arm while driving with both hands on the steering wheel.  

In this vehicle, you must have both hands on the wheel.  Driving across the desert was an adventure.  A three mph cross wind caused the steering wheel to violently turn either left or right.  Also above 60 mph the cross wind caused the vehicle to make a horrible howling sound. I have tried to get the noise rectified but, the dealer cannot duplicate the problem.

The stereo system is simply poor.  We paid $30,000 for a vehicle that I can't get A.M. reception except on the clearest of days.  The dealer agreed and replaced the radio.  The reception problem is still very poor.  The dealer believes that all the stereos with navigation have the same problem.  Honda should be embarrassed regarding the sound quality of the stereo system.

I have a family of six.  I was suprised that once we loaded our belongings in the odyssey for our trip, the rear suspension was noticably sagging.  Going over dips, it caused the rear suspension to bounce alot.  
 
Some minor annoyance was the cupholders don't securly "hold" many different size water bottles or cups. There is alot left/right movement in the brake pedal.  You can also here the gasoling swooshing around in the gas tank.  These annoyances have been deemed normal by Honda dealer.  I have no answer why any auto maker would place the electrical adaptor at the bottom of the dash board.

It may sound like I am ripping the Odyssey, I am not.  It is a good vehicle.  If I had not driven the Chrysler minivan the above observations probaly would not have been so apparant.  My wife was really dumbfounded by the features that were missing from the Odyssey.  We took for granted that the features in our Grand Caravan would be in the Odyssey.

I hope that the one Honda feature will become apparant that was ultimately lacking in my Caravan, reliability.
