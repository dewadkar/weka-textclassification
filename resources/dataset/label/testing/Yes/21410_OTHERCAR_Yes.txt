            Hello to everyone,

   I recently traded in my Hyundai Elantra 1999 (Which I had also put my review about when I had it.) and decided I wanted a Hyundai with some more features then my other one had.

   I have to say I was extremely shocked on how much has changed in the last year or two.  Its just like a luxury car now.  The front end resembles a BMW and has a more mature look and feel.  There is more features then really I was prepared for.  I would have just been happy with Power Windows and Locks but I got the hole works for about $750 more then my 1999 with just AC and Cruise Control.  Here is a list of things that are equipped with the the NEW Hyundai Elantra that I had purchased.

- Some Big Changes -

*Power Windows
*Power Locks
*Power Mirrors
*Heated Mirrors
*Remote Keyless Entry
*Car Alarm
*Duel Airbags and Duel Side Airbags
*Fold down back seats
*Four Headlights instead of two
*And even more gas mileage.


- Some Smaller Features -

*Open Door Lights (Red)
*Duel Front Map Lights (Very Bright)
*Slowly Dimming Dome Light (Stays on for a short Period after doors are closed.)
*(Aprox.) 10 Second Power Consumption. &quot;To close windows after power is off.&quot;
*LCD Odometer and Two Tachometers.
*Drivers side current gear.
*Lighted Glove Box
*Large Trunk inside pull handle (That's what I call saftey!)
*Middle Storage Console with lid that you can also store stuff.

And TONS of more that I just can't think of.

Here are some pictures:

To me this car most resembles a Toyota Avalon in the style and features for about 1/2 the cost.  Yeah you don't have heated seats and duel climate control but I am willing to loose a feature or two for about $15,000 less.

Another Big thing that is changed about the car is the location of common use things like the clock.  On the 1999 it was on the drivers side by the MPH gauge.  Now located in a more normal area, the center console.  

All - in - All, a DRASTIC change for Hyundai for the better and see a bright future in automotive competition in the united states.

If you have ever thought about getting a Hyundai Elantra a year or two ago, and decided not to, now its the time to do it... A Big change and well worth it. Two Thumbs Up!
