            The Chevrolet Camaro Z28 is truly one of America's greatest muscle cars.  It's fast, mean, and somewhat luxurious.  This is everything that you ask for from a &quot;muscle car.&quot;  The Z28 package is a performance package that comes with the regular V6 Chevy Camaro's that turns it into one mean car. This car comes equipped with a 5.7l V8 engine that will get 0-60 seconds in around 5 seconds flat.  Not bad considering that this car is very heavy.  Some good and bad things are as follows: 

<b>Good:</b> 

Like I said earlier the Camaro Z28 comes equipped with a 5.7l V8 engine that packs 320 horses and 340 lbs of torque (this also includes the SS package as well).  This is great performance for a sports car and allows the Camaro to run the quarter mile in a little over 13 seconds.  With a few performance mods and aftermarket products then you can get that time down tremendously below 12 seconds.  That is a great racing time.  The Camaro has a LS1 engine which categorizes this car right behind the Corvette, one of Chevrolet's other muscle cars. 

The Camaro responds to the small tap of the pedal by a ferocious growl of the engine and a squeel of the tires.  It literally hugs the road and takes hairpin turns without any problem whatsoever.  The suspension is great on the Camaro.  It has great handling and reflexes.  The steering wheel is very responsive and one little inch will turn the wheels tremendously. 

Not only does this car have great performance but Chevy has also included a little bit of luxury in their Camaro as well.  Everything on the interior of the Camaro is well placed and strategically located for great reach and handle.  The cockpit is well-defined with all of the gauges and controls within perfect viewpoint.  The radio and air conditioner controls are also well-located as well as the manual transmission shifter.  

The seats are rather comfortable for long road trips, especially the leather.  I wouldn't recommend black because it can get scorching hot during the summer but brown leather looks great on these cars.  The exterior also looks rather mean.  The blue or the red exterior colors look great on Z28s.  Even the Z28 logo looks great on the side of this car.  It gives it that extra meanness look.

<b>Bad:</b>

The back seats of these cars are...oh wait...what back seat?  There are two seats in the rear of this car which i guess is what Chevy likes to call a back seat.  But you can fit only two toddlers and a couple of small pets but there is no possible way that two full-grown adults can fit in the rear of these cars.  The only reason Chevrolet added a rear seat to the Camaro is so that they can classify it as a <i>passenger car</i> in the insurance and therefor the insurance will not be as high.  Have you ever seen the insurance statements for two-seater sports cars?  My point exactly.  Speaking of insurance it is still rather high although it is classified under sports cars.  The insurance companies are not idiots, they know how fast this car will run.  Therefore the insurance statements are rather high especially for teenage boys.

The visibility is rather thin.  There are several blind spots and several spots that you just can't see anything at all.  The mirrors are small and it takes a lot of getting up and moving around to see what is coming behind you in traffic.  There is also little to no storage space.  The truck is compact and will hold very little and the front space holders are thin to none other than a middle compartment that may hold a few cd's.

The radio is horrible.  Chevrolet makes a horrible radio and this one is no exception.  The radio itself needs a bit of work and I would recommend putting in an aftermarket Sony deck.  The speakers featured in the Z28 are two rear subs that won't put out any sound at all and the door speakers.  The door speakers are the best of the two but they still need a large amount of work.

The Chevrolet Camaro Z28 is one of America's pure muscle cars.  I've heard that Chevrolet is about to discontinue the manufacturing of the Z28 as well as Pontiac about to discontinue it's clone the Pontiac Trans Am so I would recommend getting a brand new Camaro before they all run out because if you don't have one...you don't know what you missing.
