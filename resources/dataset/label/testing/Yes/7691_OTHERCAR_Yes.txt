            I bought my Sentra SE-R because I was getting too many tickets with my red Honda CRX. The SE-R seemed like the perfect stealth vehicle -- quick, fun, sharp-handling and it looked like a plain old box.

I was right. I managed to avoid the suspension of my license, with no fun penalty, during five great years with this car. It handled less surgically than the CRX, but it was still deliciously precise and nice and zippy. As much as any economy sedan could be, it was like wearing a sports car.

It was even practical. The trunk was roomy, and there was plenty of space in the back seat.

Ultimately, I got rid of it because it had only two doors. A two-door sedan is the worst of both worlds -- the plain looks of a sedan and the impracticality of a coupe. Trying to squeeze two increasingly wiggly small children into car seats became a major frustration in a two-door car, so I moved on.

I see with interest, however, that the 2001 Sentra SE has four doors...<br><br>
