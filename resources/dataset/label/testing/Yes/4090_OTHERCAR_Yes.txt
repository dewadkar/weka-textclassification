            I was a struggling musician at the time of my purchase of the luxury car known very well as the Buick Park Avenue. I was only 21. I have had that car for the past 9 years and still love the ride. The seats have sunk down a little, and there is a little dimple in the arm rest on the driver door where I have rested my elbow for the past 166,749 miles across this country. I recommend to anyone considering buying a car to look closely at the Buick line of cars, especially the Park Avenue. It is roomy, soft, quite, excellent sound systems, plenty of room in the trunk for those long trips, and couldn't be a better ride. Out of the past nine years, besides regular maintenance, I have replaced the air conditioner, water pump, alternator, and oil gasket seal once. Only once. I still get 23 miles in the city and 32 on the highway. If you are sitting there looking at the price tag and thinking it is a little too much, take one for a ride. And remember, you get what you pay for. With the Park Ave, you will not be disappointed. I was so impressed with the new 2000 Park Avenue that I bought a new one. I also bought 2 Lesabres', and 3 Century's as fleet cars for myself, studio staff, and out of town clientele (supervised and escorted, of course). Buy it, you won't regret it. <br><br>
