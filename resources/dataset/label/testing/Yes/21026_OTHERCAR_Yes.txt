            I have bought this camera at Ritzcamera for only $249.99   Tax. Also, there is additional offer for this holiday season at Ritzcamera. If you buy any digital camera with them, you will get web building software, photo-organizing software, rebate coupons for memory sticks and other stuff that they claim worth $300 value. Check it out, how much worth it is for you. I would definitely say this camera is worth enough for $250.

With 3.2-megapixel resolution, the Sony DSC-P5 has all that&#146s necessary for taking digital still pictures of excellent quality. There are 5 settings from 2048x1536 for the best quality to 640x480 for just posting them on the net or emailing to a friend/relative.

P5 is very compact and weighs less than 8 oz. The camera uses Sony&#146s Memory Stick (8Mb Stick is included, I wouldn&#146t even consider this, we need to go for bigger memory card anyway) and you can transfer your photos to your computer with the USB interface (or use either a separate MemoryStick card reader). The camera comes with a rechargeable Li-Ion battery and an AC adaptor/charger.

The camera has 3x optical / 6x digital zoom. It has both auto and manual focus modes. There is an optical viewfinder as well as a high-resolution 1.5&#148 LCD.

In addition to still pictures, you can also shoot short MPEG-1 movies with mono sound. You can also shoot still pictures with audio (audio uses MPEG compression, still pictures use JPEG compression).

Different modes for still pictures include &#150 
JPEG, 
Uncompressed TIFF and
TEXT.  

It has a built-in flash, which can be set to auto mode, on or off mode, which may not be sufficient for a professional photographer. It also features red-eye reduction.  The camera has an A/V out as well as a USB terminal. The A/V composite video out can be switched between PAL and NTSC.

The camera uses a NP-FC10 battery with charging time of about 2.5 hours and lasts for about one hour (On average it allows you to take more than 1000 pictures). The still pictures can be recorded in Standard or Fine mode. The highest-resolution files are so large that the supplied 8Mb Stick can only hold about 5 of them in Fine mode or 9 in Standard mode. In movie mode it can hold 20 (HQ) to 320 seconds (160x112).

The P5 has several special effects including B&W, Sepia, Solarize and Negative Art. The camera has a Twilight program AE. You can also make manual adjustments to the exposure as well as focus and the white balance. The images can be rotated during playback. 

The Date/Time stamp mode allows you put date and time on your pictures. There is a self-timer mode (10-second delay). The sharpness of the LCD screen can be adjusted. 

It has magnesium body casing &#150 seems to resist scratching quite nicely. The camera is easy to use. 
It has automatic lens cover and the front face of the camera is flat when the lens is retracted which slips easily into a pocket.

When the battery is fully charged you get about 60 minutes of picture taking fun and about45 pictures to take depending on the quality you want of course.

I haven&#146t yet printed much from this camera. I did my ground work in epinions before buying it and it want to let people know about this deal who visit epinions often so that they can grab it before the deal expires.
