            Originally, when my girlfriend told me that she was thinking about a Daewoo, she was concerned about the quality of the Korean cars.  Luckily, I had recently studied this topic while working on my MBA.

In the past, the Korean car manufacturers were considered sub-par.  Over the past several years, however, they have significantly improved the quality of their vehicles - bringing them much more in-line with competitors.

The good thing for consumers, is that the reputation of the Korean cars is still shaky - so the manufacturers have to price the cars lower than other comparable models.  Thus, you can get a great car for a low price!<br><br>
