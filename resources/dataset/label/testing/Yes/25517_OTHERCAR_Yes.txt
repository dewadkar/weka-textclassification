            When I graduated High School in 1992, I bought a 1990 Mazda B2200. I don't know anything about the original owner, but the truck had 47000 miles on it and was practically brand new. I owned it for three years and traded it in at 90000 miles. I'm convinced that if I still had it it would still be running great. All I ever had to do is change the oil.

The truck I had was great on the highway. It cruised easily at 70, and had plenty of power to pass. I only did a little off roading with it, but I wouldn't recommend it without four wheel drive. It won't take steep hills well.

It took rain and snow well, but since the back end is really light you have to slow down in heavy rain. This truck will hydroplane at 35 in severe rain storms. Adding a camper shell and a little weight in the back will fix this problem.

The gas milage was real good for a truck. I once got about 35 MPG with it, but the average was in the high twenties.

In my experience, this truck is reliable and a lot of fun to drive. I really miss mine. I haven't bothered with Mazda since Ford bought them, but I would recommend a true Mazda to anyone. I traded the truck in on a Mazda MX3, which I have written a review on also. If you want a heavy duty work truck, I don't have the experience to help you. If you want a small, reliable truck that's fun to drive, get a Mazda. I loved mine.<br><br>
