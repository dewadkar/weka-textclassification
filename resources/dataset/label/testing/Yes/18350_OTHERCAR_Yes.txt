            The 1994 Bucik Roadmaster could be a fine used car choice if you're in the market for a nice, roomy, and powerful fullsize car. 

    Ours was purchased in 1994 because we needed a good value full size car with lots of room for the kids, and we got just that.  We bought a base model with everythnig in it, so it was basically a limited wihtout the sunroof and aluminum wheels.

    Our initial impression of the roadmaster was that it was a fine automobile at a good price ($29,000 new) that didn't handle that well.  My wife traded in her 1987 Lincoln Mark VII for this and much was gained, but some things we loved about the mark were gone, such as the great handling, muscle car power (although the buick is far from a slug), and sporty 2 door looks.

   This buick drives like a classic Buick, which is to say it feels big.  It is hard to maneuver, about as hard as our Lincoln Navigator.  The power is good though because it has a detuned corvette motor in it.  Acceleration is spirited and a bit better than my wife's current car, a 1999 Mercedes E300 TurboDiesel.  You feel quite safe in this car.  It is probably among one of the safest cars on the market today, or atleast it felt like that.  In my opinion, no amount of airbags will make up for big American steel!

   We never had any problems with the car except for a windshield crack due to the car itself (not a stone) and some oil problems after 68,000 miles.  The oil would leak somewhat heavily and require a quart of oil every week.  We had it fixed, but it only lasted for aobut 3 months, then it preceeded to leak more than it did before.

   At the end of 1999, with the oil problems, the age of the car, and the fact my wife thought it was too much of an old person's car, we traded it in for a leftover 1999 Mercedes E class.  We misswed the trunk space and overall interior roomed, but gained better gas mileage, reliabilty, resale value, solidity, maneuverability, and style.
