            Decent but not outstanding image quality comes in a small user-friendly package with fast software that hits the spot if you are like me and hate to wait.  This camera is a good compromise for the consumer who wants convenience in a nice form factor.  Don't expect to enlarge photos past 8x10, don't expect fabulous small detail but the color quality is terrific - no washed out tints here.  And, you can carry this camera/short movie taker around on your belt and it is smaller than your Motorola StarTac.  You have to buy a larger sized memory card - like 64k - it only comes with an 8k card. Over all I still like it after 3 months - a very cool camera!
