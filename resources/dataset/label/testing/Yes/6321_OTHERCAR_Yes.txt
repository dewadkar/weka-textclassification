            The Dodge Avenger is truly one of the most under-appreciated cars on the road today.  Dodge doesn't even actively advertise it.  And so, many people do not know about this great car.
I bought a 1996 Avenger ES back in November, and have been very pleased with it.  I have had no problems with it at all (except a dead battery, but that's nothing big).  The car drives like a dream.  While it may not have the performance of some other cars in its class, it more than makes up for it with its sharp looks and comfortable interior.  There is plenty of room in the front seats, and better than average (for a coupe) room in the back seats.  The trunk is just HUGE.
The Avenger has a very stable ride, though a bit bumpy because of its rigidity.  Also, the weight of the car makes it feel a little hard to handle sometimes.  The weight also hurts the car's acceleration.
If you are looking for something with the looks of a sports car and the driveablility and room of a luxury sedan, then I'd recommend the Avenger to you.<br><br>
