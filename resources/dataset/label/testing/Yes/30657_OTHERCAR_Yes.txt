               I have joined the hated ranks of the talk-on-the-cell-phone-SUV-driving-I-am-the-center-of-the-universe herd with the purchase of my Jeep. And against my rebellious, individualistic, over thirty with long hair in the corporate world nature, I like it. 
   I bought my Jeep on the secondary market about a year ago.  My poor, tired, but paid for 92 Mazda truck was just about done in.  I had no intention of buying a thirty thousand dollar plus vehicle (I paid about seventeen used) but the gadget factor got me.  Apparently, I got all the doo dads (yes, that is a technical term).  The multi-speaker Infinity sound system is just a hair or two shy of perfect and I even have seat warmers (Which, considering the amount of padding and insulation on my posterior, I need about like a pig needs a pipe organ.  Still, more buttons to play with).
   It is a great balance between luxury and functionality.  It is nice to be able to carry four NORMAL sized adults AND a fair amount of stuff if I wish without having to drive one of these gargantuan, frightening behemoths that seem to be so popular. 
   It does handle as well as I would expect a high center of gravity vehicle to and over bumps and lumps at high speeds (ie those pesky speed bumps - I didn't think you could take them at 50 so smoothly) it is surprisingly stable.   
   On the not so thrilled side, the performance is disappointing.  While with the 4.0 liter V6 I do not expect to come off the blocks like Carl Lewis, the acceleration is rather sluggish.  I would be less disappointed with this fact if I was getting better gas mileage. At an average of 17.3 highway and city combined (I know this because of my cool little onboard computer - I told you about the gadget thing), I am having to take on part-time jobs to fill the tank. 
   While I have not had any significant maintenance issues (other than a minor AC leak), I am concerned about reliability and would welcome input on this subject.  My faithful old Mazda went 168,000 miles on the original clutch among other things.  I am hoping that my Jeep will perform as well.
  I must admit, while I scoffed at the pretentiousness of this type of vehicle, it is really nice to drive one.  I know that there are about a billion of these on the road, but I still get a little kick from being a billion and one.
