            I didn't have it a week & I was cruised. Someone diving with her mother stopped in the middle of the road & said "That's Sharp!". They had to check it out & I felt like a sales-person showing it.

I also have a black L Package, privacy glass, 4WD, roof rack, automatic, key-less entry, fog lights, cloth interior, cruise, cargo net, floor mats, power locks & windows, spoiler... everything except a sun roof. I think it's the best one I've seen on the road. For looks, I give it 100%. I think the L Package upgrade is worth it. Short order is like a station wagon compared to the L Package. Since your making payments, spend the extra couple thousand & enjoy it.

It definitely drives like a little car; easier to handle than a Carolla. I'm still under 1,000 miles, but I've adjusted very quickly. I haven't "put my foot" in it, since I'm still breaking it in, but it seems nice on acceleration, very good on gas, and runs like a wild herd of horses. I live in a metro area. I deal with a lot of stop & go traffic. I've had no problems or qualms thus far with the way it runs.

It's quite spacious in terms of accommodation for storage & cargo. My friends also say they aren't jammed in the back; even with my front seat all the way back.

I agree with dbstark on the wipers. There's only one speed for intermittent. Other slower speeds would be nice. The other weird thing... There's a turning knob for bringing the seat forward up; as if I'm going to be ejected from the seat. ?? Maybe it's just me. I think the interior lighting is fine. There's a light in the front & one in the back. I have all 6 speakers on my RAV, and the sound is ok.

The pricing I reported is a little off, cause I don't remember exactly what I paid for it. I just remember the payments. The sticker was about $24,800, but I paid about $2,000 less than that. There are so-called internet deals (contact the dealership through the internet) & of course, dealers will negotiate.

After researching, I only had one real concern about the RAV. You should ask the dealer about the rear bumper. The RAV has 2 rear, corner, side guards, one on the left & one on the right, that basically serve as a bumper. Other than that, you have the spare tire - not a bumper. However I asked the dealer about this & he explained the safety features involving collisions, etc. I was pretty satisfied with his answer, but I wonder what my experience will be when someone taps me from behind or if I back into something. Has anyone had this problem?

I'm very pleased with this vehicle. My last car was a Carolla; lasted 10 years with no problems. I'm looking forward to the same history with this Toyota.
