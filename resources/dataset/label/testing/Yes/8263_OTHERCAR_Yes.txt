            My year-old T-100 now has 34,000 miles. Riding navigator, the wife is so far away she can't whack me (well, almost). You could play ping-pong in the 8-foot bed, so the size is great. Fast or slow, the ride is a controlled float, and the standard Michelins let me Boy Racer-it through traffic without drama. The automatic Four is kind of gutless, but gets 20-22 mpg in crosstown traffic, 23-25 on the highway. I do have one complaint:  it's NOISY. Anybody gone from a T-100 to the Tundra? Is it any quieter? There is lots of wind noise.

Getting into the dash and doors to fool with the stereo and mobile phone equipment is fun --- everything carefully laid out and serviceable. My last new Chevy was a joke inside, crudely held together with sheet metal screws, systems jammed atop each other thoughtlessly.

My last Toyota pickup took me 407,000 miles, driven hard &amp; put away hot. I got 23.5 mpg with real gas and 21.5 with the phony California MTBE stuff. I just changed oil every 2,000, using that Toyota-approved Fumoto drain valve, treated it to new shocks once a year and a radiator rodout every 60,000, and learned to use only Toyota factory parts. The paint was still glossy after 16 years, it still had the original starter, and it never failed our tough California smog tests, the last one on a treadmill, even.


Our Tundra, or the upcoming Tundra-Suburban, when we get it, will have more gimcracks than this bare-bones T-100. The wife's new 4Runner is certainly everything we want, but a bit narrow. Toyota quality shines through both trucks in design details like outward vision, smoothness of controls, stability in sudden maneuvers, seat comfort, quietness of mechanical components --- the engineers and assemblers obviously love their work!<br><br>
