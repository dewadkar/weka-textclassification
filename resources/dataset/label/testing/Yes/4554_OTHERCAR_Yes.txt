            Once you have owned a Toyota, you will never own any other vehicle unless you get filthy rich and go for a Porche or such.  The T-100 King Cab is awesome.  I bought it a year ago in April, and other than routine maintenance, it has been a peach.  It was recalled for a bad head gasket, but all that means is that I got a new head gasket, oil, coolant and an inside engine inspection for free.  The rear seats work well with most any child car seat, a big plus for me.  My Chev. Astro is nearly impossible to use with car seats.  The only thing I can think of to say bad is that the rear end is a little too light and if you are going at a high rate of speed and have to break hard, you are going to have some tailswinging.  Just relax and steer out as the truck responds excellently.  I have not had this truck for a whole year.  It had 47,000 miles on it when I bought it and has over 70,000 now.  I just changed the timing belt, (VERY IMPORTANT TO DO AT 60,000 MILES!!!!!), and it wasn't even cracked.  Adjusted the clutch just a little as to have more pedal.  But that was my personal preference and was not something that I really needed to do.  About a month ago, totally by accident, I had the truck airborn....when I came down I pulled over to check the damage...nothing!  Not even a cracked air dam.  The Toyota struts took all the force.  Further, the undercarriage of this truck is packed with extra steel to protect vital systems in the even of rough driving. This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned and I will not go back to &quot;domestic Detroit&quot; ever again.  When my Chev. Astro finally rolls over and dies, (which will be soon I'm sure), I intend to replace it with the Toyota T-100 King Cab or the Tundra!  I'm a fan for life!  Toyota rules the road!!!
