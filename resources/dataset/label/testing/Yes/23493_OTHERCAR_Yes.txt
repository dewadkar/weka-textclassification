            I've owned a Fuji MX-700 for 18 months or so, and it is one of my all-time favourite and most reliable digital toys. I use it for all sorts of things - both private and professional. Keeping friends and relatives around the world up to date on our young son's development  is a snap when you can go straight from smartcard to hard drive - who needs a scanner? 

Professionally, I use the MX-700 to capture images to accompany features I write for New Zealand youth/lifestyle magazine Pulp. We have found the images reproduce really well, considering their file size - high res (1MB) black and white images have even been used at full page, and looked great. Usually though, we use lo-res images in a film-strip fashion, using maybe 20 pics to illustrate a feature.

As far as ease of use goes, the MX-700 is tops. The vertical format suits even my left-handed fumblings, and the controls are obvious, as are the on-screen interface and mode LCD display. In this respect, it blows its supposed successor, the MX-1500, out of the water. (We were unlucky enough to be convinced to buy one of these at work and have regretted it ever since.)

If you're considering buying the MX-700 (or its bigger-lensed cousin, whatever that's called), may I suggest a couple of accessories? First, a bigger memory card - 4MB at least, if the machine on offer doesn't ship with one. Don't put this purchase off, either - you'll almost always get a better deal on the card if you buy it at the same time as the camera. The other &quot;must-have&quot; is an &quot;Image Memory Card Reader&quot;, model SM-R1 or equivalent. It plugs into the USB port on your iMac or similar and is like an external drive that uses memory cards instead of disks. It is 100 times faster and more convenient than feeding pictures into your computer down a wire!

Well, enough praise already... did I mention you can play your pictures from camera straight into your TV or VCR? Colourful, high res and lots of fun...

Buy this camera, or its direct descendants as they arrive. You will not be disappointed.<br><br>
