            I swore I would never buy a minivan but with two kids and lots of stuff to move around I finally looked into getting one.  I researched used minivans under $8,000 and found that the Villager and Nissan Quest were the the only ones rated OK in that price range.  

A one owner van popped up and I took it for a test drive.   I couldn't believe how well it handled compared to a 93 Chrysler grand caravan I test drove.  The interior and exterior styling were very similar to new $20,000 vans.  The paint was faded a bit but there was no rust. We bought it the next day for $7200 cdn. ($4800 US) and had it power buffed and the paint came back to like new.

It is very reliable and has only needed a battery, heater motor and a wire soldered for the rear fan.  Ford wanted over $600 for a new heater control module but after a bit of research I learned this was a common problem that only needed to be soldered.( I took it out and a friend did it for free).

Because the van is in great overall condition I have put additional work into it to bring it to better than new.
This includes:
- replacing the timing belt and drive belts $300 incl parts and labour (just in case). 
- Replaced a front strut that was rattling $100 
- new tie rod ends, lower ball joints and control arm bushings $400 (got the pair of used conrol arms with complete bushings and balljoints from a auto wrecker with only 20,000 miles on them.

- added remote start and keyless entry 
- added custom 16 inch wheels and Nokian NRW tires to improve the looks and handling.  It now handles better than several brand new vans I have driven latley and better than most cars I have owned.

Almost everyone thinks we spent $15,000 on a 2 yr old van.

A couple of manifold bolts are broken and will be $300-600 to get fixed.  (doesn't affect performance)

We get 20 mpg combined city / hwy  

I highly reccommend this van !

My brother and his wife bought a new 1999 dodge van and are regretting their decision.  They still owe over $15,000 on the van but can only get $13-14,000  for it.  It has cost them close to $10,000 in depreciation to drive a new van for less than 3 years.  He could have bought 2 used Villagers and had vehicles for 10 yrs.
