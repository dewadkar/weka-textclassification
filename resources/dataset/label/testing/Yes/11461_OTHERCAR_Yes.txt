            When shopping for my first new car back in 1995, I had run into some snags along the way. I had been driving a 1988 Chevy Cavalier, that had died, and I was stuck in a college town, living off campus, with no means of transportation.

I went to test drive another Cavalier, and the sales men had me on edge, when I had called in it was one price and when I talked to them in person it was another price, that was well out of my range, and they were not very nice to me. Here I was 22 without someone to help me purchase my first new
car,in a strange town, and not only was I a college student, on a tight budget, but I was a woman as well. Needless to say I was quite upset.

I had remembered my freshman roommate who had had a Saturn RAVE about her car. She absolutely loved it, so I called up to find the one Saturn Dealership near me, which was about 55 miles away and talked with a salesperson. The salesman was so very very nice, and even offered to
call my mother in Florida to help make a decision on the car. My mom decided I should go take a look at the car, after my test drive, Bill, the Salesperson who was helping me, proceeded to make arrangements for her to test drive the same exact car in Ft Lauderdale where she was at to see if she liked it. He was very understanding about my situation and was there for every step of the process.  After 2 weeks, my mother and I decided that the Saturn SL1 was the best car for me, and we decided to load it with everything except a sunroof, since my head went thru the roof when putting in one (one bad point of being long bodied). 


I luckily got there two days after they had introduced my favorite color, Dark Green, and I immediately fell in love with the color swatch, yet they didn't have the car color in stock. Living a few hours away from Tennessee did pay off though, two days later I got a call saying my new car was being driven in and would be ready for me anytime after 3pm. I was so excited. 

When I got to the dealership they actually had the big red bow on my car and all applauded for me, It was just like the commercials!!! To this day I can still walk into that Dealership and get a warm hello from Bill.

They made purchasing my first car, easy as one could hope for, and are constantly helpful. Even when driving out to California, I was able to stop at any dealership and have a nice smile, from some nice people while they fixed whatever was wrong with my car. With 78,000 miles on my car it is well used, and very lived in and loved. 
 
I definitely plan on buying another Saturn, and always suggest it to my friends who are looking for cars. 

Saturn is a great company, a great car and a terrific family!!! <br><br>
