            This is one of the sweetest cars that I have ever driven. I bought my 1998 Dark Blue Contour in September of 1998. I have two children, so I needed a car that was roomy as well as sporty. In the year and a half that I have owned this car, I have put 21,000 miles on it. The only problem that I have had with it is when it is raining and I hit a puddle of water, I lose power steering and my battery light comes on. Ford figured out that it was water hitting my power steering pulley and belt and they will be fixing the problem next week. Other than that, she rides like a dream and I would have no problem replacing her with another Contour once the time comes. <br><br>
