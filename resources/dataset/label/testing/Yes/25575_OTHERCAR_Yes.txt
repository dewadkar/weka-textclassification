            I bought BMW Z3 with no doubt in my mind.  I have been driving BMW 528 for about three years and it was the time for change.  I went to look for another BMW but I didn't have specific model in mind at that time.  But there is. Black body with tan roof top with my name on it.  I didn't even look at another car after I saw my Z3.

I have been loving driving this car since then but there are few minor problems so far, nothing big though.

Just like the other person commented, air bag light and engine light has been on and off.  I took it to service and they didn't find anything wrong with  air bag or engine themselves.  So lights were out for a while but recently air bag light came on again.  
I will take it to service whenever....
There was another problem.  You know the armrest / handle on driver side door.  It came off!!  That was something unexpected from Ultimate driving machine BMW.  I was driving with the armrest hanging for about a month  because service dept. was very busy after flood in Houston.  But I got the new part so it's okay.
And this one is a MAJOR problem to me.  Every time it rains, water leaks from the roof top.  I mean badly.  When it rained really hard in Houston, I got really wet in the car.  I couldn't go outside to check the roof because the bad weather at that time.  I took it to the dealer and complained that it is just ridiculous for me to get soaked with water every time it rains.  It is not covered under the warranty but BMW replaced the seal for the top.  It remedied some problems but water still drips into the interior when I roll down the window at drive through or something.

Everything above happened within 2 months after I purchased this car.  Oh well, it's four years old but essential stuff like that should not have problems at all.  As long as I have warranty, I am okay.  Not to mention, it had only 22,000 miles on it when I bought it.  So I still have long way to go to use up the warranty.

But still, small problems shouldn't really matter to the people who are interested in purchasing BMW in the future because people who drive BMW love BMW all the way.  As long as it drives good and you feel safe in it, that's all it matters to me.
