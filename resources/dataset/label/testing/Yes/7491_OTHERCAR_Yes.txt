            I bought my Stratus used, but with low miles, almost three years ago. I've really enjoyed the car; it's been one of the best I've owned and is a pleasure to drive.

Pros - first there's the roominess. Dodge uses the "cab forward" design and makes for lots of room inside. Front passengers can really stretch out and they can do it without crushing the passengers in the rear seats. Rear passengers have good headroom and better-than-average leg room.

Next, is the smooth V6 engine (at least on the ES model). It's not cranking out huge amounts of horsepower, but it is more than adequate and the Stratus has good acceleration. I drove the four-cylinder model and found the engine to be much less smooth than the six (this, I think, is typical for four-cylinder engines). 

I don't use the Auto Stick feature too often, but do like that it's there. It lets you shift the gears like you would a manual transmission, only with a simple flick of the shift lever. It comes in handy when coming down a long grade and it also helps in icy conditions (you can start out in 2nd gear to avoid spinning the drive wheels).

The trunk is huge. You could put the possessions of a small country back there. It has an inside release lever, so you can pop the trunk before you exit the car. It also has fold down rear seats in a 60/40 split for those rare cases when you can't fit what you're hauling in the trunk (good for snow skis, etc).

The handling of this car is excellent. It corners without any noticeable body roll. You can power through a turn with confidence. The steering does not have much/any slop and it's very responsive. It just feels good on the road and is a real pleasure to drive.

I like the body style. It looks sporty, yet doesn't overdo it. As others have said, the back deck is a bit high and that can make backing up a thrilling experience.

Cons - I can't really think of too many major ones. There are some serviceability issues to take into consideration. For example, the battery is located down behind the front left wheel (I understand you have to take the wheel off to access). Now, they run some wires up to terminals under the hood for jump-starting, but it's not going to be fun to replace the battery yourself (I say this having never done it; maybe it's a breeze).

Also, I took the car in for a tune-up a few weeks back and they told me that you had to remove the intake plenum to get to the rear three spark plugs. That is pretty involved and would make it a pricey experience. However, they also said that the car comes with platinum plugs that go for 100,000 miles, so I won't have to worry about it for a while. Maybe these kinds of things are expected on modern auto designs. You be the judge...

Oh, the quality problems...also minor: the weatherstripping on one of the back doors is coming off at the top. I tried to work it back on the frame, but have so far been unable to do so. I'm sure it can be glued back into place, given time, but you wouldn't expect to have to do this on a car that only has 18,000 miles on it.
