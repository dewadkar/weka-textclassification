            When I decided I wanted a SUV, I looked at all that the manufacturers had to offer.  I wasn't impressed. First, I saw the too big to be functional Expeditions and Suburbans.  Then, there were the yuppie Explorers and the other preppy &quot;I can't take my prissy SUV off the well paved road&quot; type.  Lastly came the compact SUV market with its wimpy little CRVs and RAV4s that are built off of car platforms.  At that point, I found the Xterra.  It offered ruggedness and overall functionality that has been forgotten in the SUV market excluding maybe the Cherokee.  It does all this with an affordable price tag also.
So, I went to the dealership to get my new Solar Yellow Xterra 4wd SE(which, by the way, was the only one within 600 miles).  I have loved it ever since.  It is everything you could want in an SUV.  It has pretty good power, nice handling, and it turns heads everywhere I go.  I got more comments in the first week of owning my X than in the entire ownership of my previous truck.  But when the X really starts to shine, is when she goes off road.  I have driven a many 4x4s in my day and have witnessed even more off road, but to this day I have never seen a stock vehicle go through the stuff this vehicle goes through without even slowing down.  Its an absolute off road beast.  
The interior is great, too. I have made several long road trips in it without the &quot;numb-butt&quot; that comes from driving many vehicles long distance.  And I have been known to stuff 8 to 10 people in it on the weekends.
And through 4 months of ownership, only one thing about the X has arisen that I didn't like.  Flipping on the cruise switch is awkward.  That's it.
This vehicle is perfect for anyone with its aggressive looks and extreme functionality.  But car drivers beware,  this is no car/SUV hybrid such as the CRV or RAV4, it's a truck and drives accordingly.  I happen to really like that aspect, but I have been informed that some people don't.  To each his own, I guess.<br><br>
