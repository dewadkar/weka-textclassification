            I like my escort. it's a 96 and i've gotten 4 good years out of it and hopefully more to come.  i got this car because it was my grandmother's and when she died her car went to my family and my parents already had cars so i got it. the thing i dislike about it is the seats. they are very uncomfortable for long trips because they are so hard and molded to a certain shape that doesn't fit the contour of my back. another thing in that the cigarette lighter is not always effective. i don't actually use it to smoke but to plug in my portable cd player and every once in a while the power cuts out and turns of the music. then i have to play around with it while i'm driving and it creates worries for me. For me, the escort is an okay car, but i would never buy a two door car. the smallest i would ever buy is that saturn with the three doors, but as far as fitting my friends into the back without adjusting my seat, it can't be done in a two door.<br><br>
