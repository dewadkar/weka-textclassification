            I bought my 95' Sonoma regular cab shortbed about a year and a half ago and it's been a good truck. When I bought it, it had 37,500 miles on it, now it has 52,412 miles on it. It's fully loaded with power everything except it has the 2.2 4 cylinder and 5 speed manual. It's got a little bit of power, of course the manual tranny helps a little. The ride isn't bad, I've had it on the highway a few times and it rides pretty good. The interior is roomy enough for me, although the bucket seats could be a little more comfortable though. I've only had a few problems with the truck (1) backup lights don't work. (in process of fixing), (2) carpet on drivers side trans. hump is starting to wear. (3) in the process of tracking down a coolant smell (think its the heater core), as you can see nothing is serious is wrong with this truck. I've heard there is a problem with the 2.2 4 cyl called piston slapping, but I haven't experienced this problem (I think it only applies to 96'-97' 4cyl and 95'-97' vortec V8's). Other than that it's been a very reliable truck, and I'd recommend it to anybody.    <br><br>
