            I was desperate for a car when I bought my 1985 Chevy Cavalier wagon in 1994...a 9 year old car for $2,000 was all I could afford.

Even though it was an older car, with about 85K miles on it, this car ran like a dream, even with a too-expensive to fix for me oil leak.  It never had to go in the shop for anything more than regular maintenance, always started up for me even in the coldest weather, and was a regular horse that wouldn't die.  It's cargo capacity is great for groceries and for people like me who love to yard sale....I could load it up with a days worth of stuff and still have room for groceries and the kids.

I would highly recommend this car for its space, low maintenance, ability to get high mileage (mine was at 167K when I sold it for $1K and it is still running to this day), and for Chevy's good name.
