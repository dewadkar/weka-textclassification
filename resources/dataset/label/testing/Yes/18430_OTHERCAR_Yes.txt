            I bought my Toyota Corolla, because the car I was driving at the time was on it's death bed.  I am a college student and didn't have a lot of money to spend on something fancy.  I searched everywhere for almost 3 months and I found a 1997 Corolla and fell in love with it!  Let me explain.

Interior: 8
I have leather interior and the seats are very comfortable.  A recommendation for leather lovers, if the sun shines cover up the seats.  The back your legs don't feel good when they're burned!  Seatbelts work great!  I know this for a fact.  It's fully equipped with driver and passenger side airbags.  The back is roomy enough for 3 people to sit comfortably. If you're going on an extended road trip, tall people should sit in the front.

Exterior: 9
The color: a sweet deep red with a glassy glow.  Not a flaw.  It doesn't look like a new Honda Accord, but it does look better than the older model Corolla's even the 2000 model doesn't look this good.  Tinted windows or not, this car is gorgeous.  

Engine: 10
I haven't had one problem with this car since I bought it!  The miles keep piling up but the problems never occur!  It's a safe and reliable car!  Gas prices are up now, but with the Corolla, I don't pay an arm and a leg with the mileage I get off of this car.  At least 400 miles per tank and that's driving to work everyday and back to school.  It's a smooth ride and it handles great.  Breaks work excellent even on wet roads.  No loud noises.


This car is good for high school and college students, even parents.  It's safe, reliable, and doesn't cost that much.  <br><br>
