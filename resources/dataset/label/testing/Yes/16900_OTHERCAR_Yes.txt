            The Sony FD-95 Digital camera is an exceptional camera.  I purchased it primarily because of three features. 1. The 10X zoom lens with another 10X of digital zoom. The quality and performance of the lens is beautiful. 2. The floppy disk media. It's cheap, reusable and easy to transfer the pictures to your computer. 3. It has a viewfinder.  A lot of the cameras (even the high end cameras) don't have one and the ability to see the LCD screen in the sunlight is near impossible.

I purchased the floppy adapter but don't use it much because of the long recording time (about 15 seconds).

I would like to see an external battery charger so you could have a fresh battery on standby when you are taking a lot of pictures<br><br>
