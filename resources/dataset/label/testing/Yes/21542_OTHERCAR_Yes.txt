            The Canon S200 is not the best digital camera you can buy for around 300 bucks.  You can easily find a camera with more than 2 Megapixels, more than 2X optical zoom, and more the a 8 Megabyte CF card for the same price.  Heck, you can probably find a camera with 6X zoom, that plays MP3's, has a docking station and burns pictures to cute little mini cd-roms, for a comparable price.  

I am not a professional photographer, I use my camera to take casual pictures of birthdays, Christmas, weddings, outings, etc.  I don't do artsy-fartsy, still-life shots nor do I do head shots for Cindy Crawford.

Now on to my point. 

You can get a digital camera with all the great above mentioned features for around the same price, but you cannot get it in the same tiny package.  The cameras that have huge zooms, built in hard-drives, MP3 players, or piggy-back CD burners are great, except for one thing - they stay at home most of the time because they are too big to lug around.  The S200 spends much more time taking pictures because it goes where you go.  Even an average size camera requires a case or a neck strap to carry around, and you wouldn't even think about taking it somewhere like an amusement park because you'd have nowhere to put it.  The Elph tucks safely away in your pocket when not in use.  I would never think of taking my average sized 35MM for a night out on the town for fear of looking like a weirdo tourist, with the Elph my weirdo tourist tendencies are my secret.

The S200 doesnt have the most features but it is no barebone model either.  It has a multitude of shooting modes, adjustable shutter speed, different flash settings, settings for B/W and sephia tones, Movie mode, Exposure length, and intelligent auto-focus.

I have had no functionality problems whatsoever, however I do recommend purchasing some sort of extended warranty through your local retailer.  This camera won't spend its life safely screwed to a tripod, you'll toss it in your pocket, purse, bra-strap, etc. exposing it to a bit more danger than your average camera.  You'll need more memory too 8 Mb won't cut it for most outings, 64Mb is fine.  The battery is included and rechargeable, it will last you a full day of shooting.  Lastly I'd like to have the leatherette sheath that is included with the 35MM Elphs, shuffling around in a pocket with keys and change could easily blemish the beautiful metal case.
