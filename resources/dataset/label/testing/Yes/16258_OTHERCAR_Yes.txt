            I suppose anything would seem like a beautiful dream after driving around a 1987 Ford Escort for more than a year.  But still, there are so many things inherently RIGHT about the 99 Corolla.

My wife and I had never owned a brand new vehicle before we bought our Corolla, so for the first 6 months or so it felt naughty, like we were somehow cheating.  Everything was just so damn easy!  No oil/transmission fluid/power steering fluid/fuel/wiper fluid leaks.  No bald tires.  No cracked windshield.  No wire hanger holding the front license plate on.  Compared to all our other cars, a straight-off-the-lot Corolla was like a freaking Lear jet.

Immediately, I was struck by the ease of handling.  Toyota really outdid themselves with the 99 Corolla's smooth, solid suspension and comfortably tight turning radius.  It also excelled on the highway, riding low to the ground and cutting the air like a knife.  I should note at this point that our last car shuddered uncontrollably at speeds upwards of 45 mph, so even a fairly lightweight compact like the Corolla was a vast improvement.  Mind you, this is no Lincoln Continental or anything - it's still a compact car - but it definitely rides smooth and easy... good enough for any road trip.

Which we embarked on within a month of purchase!  We drove the Corolla down I-5 to San Francisco to visit my sister-in-law.  It was an absolute pleasure.  The 4-speed automatic transmission wanted to downshift a lot on long uphill stretches, but disengaging the &quot;Overdrive&quot; (just the 4th gear, turned on and off via a button on the PRNDL stick) kept it revving high and prevented lots of jerky shifts from 4th to 3rd and vice versa.

Even at speeds upwards of 80 mph (not that I would ever advocate breaking any laws by driving so fast), the Corolla drove comfortably.  You notice the speed, not because it feels dangerous, but because it feels FUN.  Factor in Toyota's ultra-smooth power steering, and the mountain curves near Grant's Pass, OR are like a giant flight simulator.

I shouldn't forget how roomy our Corolla is, either.  Not counting the kid-size legroom in the back seat, this vehicle has ample space to haul just about anything.  I've been very pleased with having enough room to transport both my gear AND my bassist's to practices and shows.  (To those of you who don't know, guitar amps are usually pretty big, and bass amps are even bigger.)

For a vehicle that we picked up for under $15,000 (nicely featured), the 1999 Toyota Corolla is a wonderful bargain.  It gets good gas mileage (consistently around 30-35 mpg), and, as all Toyotas, will run FOREVER.  They have excellent resale value as well.

I recommend this car to anyone and everyone.<br><br>
