                 I bought a used Kia Sportage 5 months ago. I had been looking for a year, and never could find anything that compared to it. Mine is 4WD with 4 doors. It has a very low gear ratio, which more than makes up for having a 4 cyl engine. The power is greater than any other 4 cyl I have driven. I don't have to worry about being stuck in a situation where I'm afraid to pull out into traffic. I didn't mention that I also have a standard transmission.

     I have children, and the four doors mean that everyone can get in and out easily. My children also love the fact that there is a good view, even from the back seat, due to the rear seat being a little higher than the front seats and the fact that there are so many windows. No more car sickness!

 The 4WD will get you anywhere you want to go, which surprised my husband, since he has a 4WD Dodge and I think I can get around better than he can. The ride is quiet, comfortable, and not what you would expect from a 4WD, since usually you have to put up with a bumpy and less comfortable ride with a 4WD.

 5 people can fit in this vehicle along with luggage and a cooler. We were much more comfortable on our last vacation! I plan on buying a new one the next time I'm ready to buy and just passing this one on to one of the kids.

 I would suggest that if you are interested in a luggage rack and a spare tire carrier, that you get those options when you buy because those are not available for add-on later without major body work to add the support necessary to hold them. Those supports are not put in at the factory if the vehicle isn't ordered with these options. <br><br>
