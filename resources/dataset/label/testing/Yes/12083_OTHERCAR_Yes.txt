                 I've don't get to drive this car very much, it's not mine.  But, I still get occasional use of it, so I feel qualified to review it.  
 
     I really like this SUV!  It's sporty feeling, gets better-than-average gas mileage, and has enough power.  The other cars that are in this class are the Honda CR-X and the Toyota Rav 4, along with the Subaru Forrester and Kia Sportage.  The CR-X and RAV4 are less SUV like and more car like, due mostly to the fact that the CR-X and RAV4 are built on car chassis.  They're much slower (4 bangers) than the Forrester or Grand Vitara, and can't do the off road thing too good.  The Forrester is a better car than the Grand Vitara, IMHO, and it better be since it costs a LOT more.  The Sportage is a Kia, and I don't know anything about them, so I won't compare the GV to it.  So, back to the Grand Vitara...
    
      I chose this car to drive to the prom, for several reasons:

A.  The Izuzu Trooper we drive is old, smelly, crappy, and would totally negate any chances of me getting in good with my date

B.  The Jeep I had had the same problems, was 8 years older than the Trooper, and was not reliable unless the trip was downhill both ways.

C.  My dad wouldn't let me take his 1997 Chrysler Lebaron.  Damn him.

D.  My beloved Ford Escort had not yet entered my life.  (see my review of it)
      
    This car gets good gas mileage for a V-6 (25 Highway, about 18 city), is pretty quick (but still slow for a V-6, that's probably because it's only a 2.5 liter) and has been somewhat reliable.  It got stuck in 4WD after two months, but the warranty took care of that.  And, the tires are pretty crappy, they have little tread for an SUV's factory tires and need replacing quickly.  It's a quiet ride, no suspension problems and the engine is whisper quiet.  Wind becomes a problem, but you can't avoid that in an SUV.  It came with a 6 Cd changer, but the speaker system is less than stellar.  The interior is comfy, but not for five people.  A little cramped in back, but once again, it's a mini-suv, so that's expected.  Suzuki had a pretty good track record with the sidkick, and I think ths wil be a good follow up.  We've only had this car for 8 months, I'll post updates on how reliable it as as they warrant.      <br><br>
