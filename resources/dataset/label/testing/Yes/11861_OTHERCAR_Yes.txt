            I sold my SUV, and I haven't had this much fun driving since my VW GTi. I visited Honda to buy the Accord, but I drove off with the Civic. Why?

Incentives: Honda throws a good clearance program that's easy to understand. I got $2000 cash back and 1.9% apr by opting for a Civic. That talked me out of the whole 0% apr craze from competitors. Dealer was cooperative and willing to listen.

Ride: Similar to previous Accords.

Roominess: Similar to previous Accords.

Appearance: Old Accord style, neutral and versatile. Fits the look on the beach while driving barefoot as well as the office wearing shirt & tie. One gripe: the clearcoat paint scratches/waterspot very easily, so washing requires TLC. 

Fuel economy: The fuel gauge teeters a lot so I have to assume it hovers 30-35. Maybe 40 on a long road trip. I drive fast and go up/down hills so economy was not a priority for me but a great bonus when cash is low.

Performance: Acceleration is loud of course, but once I hit 80-100 mph, the calmness of the VTEC engine was an absolute dream at high speed. No shimmy from the steering wheel whatsoever. It may as well have been a luxury compact at that point. The ride begins to stink at local street speeds of 25-35 because the automatic is sensitive (as it should), the engine revvs loud, fairly weak on the uphill without momentum, and a very bouncy on soft road surfaces. The stock Firestone tires are the source if you hear a faint hum.  Evasive handling was reliable and predictable but definitely lacks the solid "on rails" responsiveness of a european car.

Braking: Very tight. The Civic's ABS offers a very noticeable secondary "oomph" and "purr" to let you know the ABS is working after the initial braking. Absolute must-have on a small car.

My recommendation: If you can afford it, get the EX. It's worth the extra dollars. Only on the EX you get ABS, VTEC, Sunroof, and HEIGHT-adjustable seating to get a taller view of the road.  If you work hard, you need to reward yourself with neat options.  Leather steering gave a luxury touch.
