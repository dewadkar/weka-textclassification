            We bought our 1996 Ford Taurus Wagon (Gold) new.  We bought it because we didn't want the bulk of a minivan, and yet wanted to be able to transport a few children.  We bought the wagon with the third seat (the way, way, back as my kids call it!)  We are very, very happy with it.

We can seat seven people comfortably (two being children in the way, way back seat.)  My kids love to sit facing backward.

We have never had any mechanical problems with the car at all.  The finish is holding up, but we garage the car so I guess this is expected.  It is a comfortable car to drive.  It is a very reliable car.

I like the rear window windshield wiper.  It works well to keep the window clean when needed.

One con of the car is that it doesn't have much pickup.  Sometimes it is hard to really get the car going if there is a short on ramp to a highway.  Another con is that when you put the front seat back (ie to get more legroom) it leaves little room in the back seat.  For example, I have a car seat behind the passenger front passenger seat.  If I put the front seat back to get more leg room, my daughter complains of lack of room.  Also, it makes it difficult for my son to get out the door on the side where my daughter is.<br><br>
