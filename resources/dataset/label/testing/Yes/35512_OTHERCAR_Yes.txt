            PROS:

Space and convenience: Excellent space usage and beats all the competition in adjusting seats and the folding back seat is a dream come true.
Ride: For being one of the largest vans in its class, it handles very    well.

CONS:

Too many annoying glitches:

Recalls: Have had recalls on the automatic door (something about the 
         possibility of it opening by itself while you are driving -    
         never happen to me though), 
         Dashboard lights (all lights turned off one fine day! They did 
         have a recall later),
         Some recall in the exhaust system where they had to drill a 
         hole in a pipe to avoid ice deposits in winter.
         One additional one that I can't remember.

Recently my check Engine light has been on and I have been to the dealership once and they could find out why. Few hours after they turned it off it is on again - I will keep you updated on how I make out.

Beware of the Side view mirrors - EXTREMELY FRAGILE and REPLACEMENT is 
EXPENSIVE ! My neighbors kid pressed on the mirror and it popped off. What is worse is that the replacement cost me $130 for parts + labor. The central pivot snaps off and one has to get the complete unit including the power motor and casing replaced ! I am trying to talk to HONDA about it but unless a lot of customers complain I think I am outta luck. JUST be careful about them! (another friend of mine knocked it off his garage door and he paid a total of $175.)   

Automatic sliding door doesn't stop beyond a certain point if you place your hand or another object - typically if it is less than 12-24 inches from reaching the end of the opening. 

Remote to unlock doesn't always work as advertised. Double click to unlock often doesn't work and one has to click multiple times on the remote. I thought it was my problem but the guy at the dealership had the same issue.
