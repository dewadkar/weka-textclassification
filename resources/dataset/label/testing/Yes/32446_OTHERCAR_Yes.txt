            This car has been a true champion in the face of adversity.  I bought it at a year old with about 12k miles, while living in Wisconsin (big stretch for an LA native).  The day we picked it up involved driving back over 100 miles, much of it through the hardest rain I've ever experienced in my life.  The very next night on the open highway, I hit a deer head on at 80 mph (my speed, not the deer's).  I never even saw it, and I swear I only had my eyes off the road for 3 seconds.  The real kicker was that it was a Sunday night, and I didn't plan to set up my insurance until the next morning.  Over $4,000 in damage, coming entirely out of my pocket just a few short days after buying this little red devil!

Make sure your wheels are insured.  Shortly after driving this car back to CA, I woke up one morning to find my car sitting in the front driveway on milk crates.  The kids like to buy these wheels from their buddy's buddy's buddy for $150/set and stick them on their lowered Civics.  (I've personally seen at least 2 other similarly violated GS-Rs sitting in public parking areas.)  The good news is that you didn't want those wheels anyway.  The stock tire/wheel package is not up to the task, compared to 16&quot; or 17&quot; wheels with lower-profile tires.

With your new, wider, slightly heavier wheel setup, you'll immediately notice a slightly drop in acceleration.  Some folks prefer to stay with a 15&quot; setup for this very reason, but perhaps they should consider driving a Mustang or Camaro instead.  This car is all about maneuverability, and the vast improvements gained in cornering, stability, and braking are worth the small speed penalty.

The 1.8L engine with 8100 rpm redline once offered the highest ratio of power-to-size available in <i>any</i> normally-aspirated production automobile.  (That distinction later went to the 190HP Integra Type R, and now belongs to the 240HP Honda S-2000.)  The GS-R likes to play rough.  Drive it politely and it will simply say &quot;Go away, my soaps are on!&quot;  But put your foot in it and shift waaay later than you're used to, and you'll instantly have it's attention.  It will reward you with a great sound and lots of go.

The shifter alone was a big buying incentive for me.  After trying all the competitors of the day (Talon/Eclipse, Neon, Saturn, etc), the GS-R's short and precise shifter felt to be at an entirely higher level.  My only complaint with it would be that cruising at a decent highway speed (90 mph) means running at a fairly high rpm (4500), which gets a little noisy and can't be as economical.  A 6-speed would be ideal, but I don't think they were too widely available 6 years ago.

Some people may complain that the seats are too hard but to me, firm, supportive, and perfectly sculpted are exactly what you want to stay well planted and free of back- or butt soreness.  I found the seats and overall driving position to again rank well above the previously mentioned competitors.

The sunroof is really a blast!  Lame puns aside, you can keep it fully open at 70 mph quite comfortably, generally without too much wind or noise, although this is largely dependent on the outside conditions (weather, traffic, (news, sports...)).

The rest of the interior is clean and functional, but probably nothing great by today's standards.  This is essentially a Civic platform, so don't expect too much wood and leather (although Honda does know how to do plastic well).  The radio is certainly usable, but nothing spectacular.

A big party bonus is the fact that this is really a station wagon in disguise!  In fact, the only sensible replacement (with equal or higher ability) that I can see for this car would have 5 doors, come from Sweden or Germany, and cost twice what I paid for this.  Put the split rear seats down and the hatchback makes a great little truck.  I've had 3 people and 3 bikes in the car, with plenty of comfort for all.

Of course a big problem with these cars (in CA anyway) is that you will see tons of them, mostly driven by kids (backward/crooked baseball caps, seats fully reclined, blaring radios, blaring custom exhausts) on their way to Jack in the Box.  So if you're considering one of these, don't buy it to stand out, or to build your image as a mature, responsible adult.

Some known bugs include sticking windows/sunroof, which can be fixed by lubing with graphite power, and a loose b-pipe in the exhaust system (causing a buzzy exhaust noise at 3200 rpm), which can be fixed for $40-400, depending on your solution of choice.  Also, I've been through 2 clutches, which may be the car's fault, but is probably at least partly due to my driving.

Compared to most cars I've ridden in, the interior always tends to be on the warm side.  Even in moderate, comfortable weather, it will always be 5-10 degrees warmer than outside.  The vent air is always a bit warmer than outside too.  Having black interior and somewhat horizontal windows doesn't help.  Getting the windows tinted definitely does.  Of course it has a/c, but I usually prefer open windows and sunroof whenever possible.  If I do this on the highway, I'll often wear earplugs, as I value my hearing.  I think this is illegal in CA (I know wearing headphones is), but they let people drive Lexuses (Lexi?), which are pure isolation chambers.  So anyway, non-black interior will probably stay cooler.

Acura of course offers the Integra in several flavors.  The RS is quite entry level, while the LS adds such niceties as air conditioning and sunroof.  The Type-R adds engine and suspension improvements, and theoretically increases sportiness by taking away the a/c and sunroof (although I believe a/c is available now).  To me, the GS-R is clearly the best combination of performance, luxury, and value.

The 3rd generation Integra has been around a while now.  I don't know how it compares to the current Celica or Eclipse, but I suspect it still holds its own just fine, thank you.  The current Integra's replacement is due out in the next year or two.  There are rumors that it will be combined with the Prelude (which is very underrated) and called &quot;Interlude&quot;.  Whatever they call it, I'm sure it will be a screamer!<br><br>
