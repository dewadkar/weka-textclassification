            I've had a Type-S for 9 days now and it's awesome.  I originally test drove a automatic (non Type-S) and didn't care for it too much.  I was trading in my leased TL and wanted to buy a car (as opposed to leasing another one).  The power of the TL was awesome and it's smooth as silk.  I was worried about dropping down to a 4-cyl automatic because I new I'd miss the power and acceleration.  I knew the Type-S had 40 more horsepower and a 6-disc in-dash CD changer...but it was a stick shift.  I didn't know how to drive a stick shift.  My best friend had purchased a stick shift about 2 years ago and loved it.  So I decided to buy the Type-S since it had some pretty impressive numbers and because it wasn't that much more than the non Type-S.  I didn't even test drive it!

Why did I do such an impulsive, illogical thing??

1)  This car was built in Japan.  My TL was built in Ohio and while it was technically a "Japanese" car, there were always little weird things that could never be explained.  Like why the gas gauge was always reading wrong or why it wouldn't play some CDs (even after getting a new CD player from the dealer).  The RSX, was built in Japan and is immaculate...it's completely different (even from previous generation Integras).  Everything just "feels right."

2)  6-disc in-dash CD player.  Subwoofer in the spare tire.  That's right...there's a subwoofer hidden in the spare tire.  It's about the same power as the TL's flat woofer and it sounds great!

3)  Leather Seats by Recarro.  The seats are awesome!  Great support, great feel, super comfortable.

4)  Storage space.  The car may look small, but there are little compartments and containers everywhere.  There's a sunglass holder on each door along with the regular map pockets.  On the center console are cup holders and trays galore.  The backseat even has lots of space to put stuff.  My Canon S10 fits perfectly in the little compartment next to the parking brake.  My Motorola StarTac fits perfectly in the little door nook behind the window controls...it's as if they "knew"...spooky...

5)  Auto window-down AND up.  This is a great feature that I wish I had in the TL.

These factors alone caused me to buy the Type-S.  Now here's why I love the car:

1)  Acceleration.  This car is unbelievably fast...it's faster than the TL and RL...even rivals the S2000...although that one takes the cake because of the extra 40hp over the Type-S.  But hey, you save about 10K and get 2 extra seats...not to mention a usable trunk!

2)  Handling.  We took this car up into the Saratoga Mountains (kinda like the Mullholand Drive of the Bay Area).  And let me tell you that this car is unbelievable.  It sticks like glue...and not just the white Elmer's school glue, but I'm talking about the super Krazy glue brand that will bond your skin for life if you're not careful.  My best friend (who has a lowered Toyota Solara with 18" Wheels) was blown away by how the car just did what you wanted at any speed...no tires squealing...no loss of control...it felt like the car was directly wired to the my brain.  The Michelin MXM tires which are technically geared are considered a general purpose rather than a performance tire were great!  I can't wait to strap on a set of Michelin Pilots to my Type-S and see what she can really do.  And yes...always, ALWAYS pay for the Michelins.  My friend has work at a tire shop for years and can tell any brand tire while you are driving!  He says that Michelins are made from different stuff and manufactured differently.  They have extreme quality control that most other manufacturers don't bother with.  This means you will always get a tire that is easy to balance, always perfectly round, and that will perform.

3)  Stick Shift.  I always thought driving stick shift would be a pain or a hassle, but after about a week, I got most of it down.  The shifting is fun and the car can really go.  I can't wait to break her in and row through the gears with a little more throttle.

4)  Plays burned CDs.  The TL had problems with burned CDs and even some store-bought CDs.

And that's about it.  Anyway, if you are looking for a great car that gets you from point A to B QUICKLY...then this is it.  My only quibble is the lack of the navigation system option.  I'm just going to have to install one myself :)
