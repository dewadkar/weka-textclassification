            Pros:
I Love my Durango.  I have had a few Toyota's in the past and was looking at the new 4Runners.  The V8 in the Durango attracted me to take it for a test drive.  After my test drive, I never made it to any other dealerships.  
The Durango has plenty of power.  I piled 5 of my closest friends in my Durango pulling a trailer with a motorcycle headed to the Superbike Championships.  We were going through mountainous areas with no drag on performance.
Room is plentiful.  I am over six foot and run out of room pretty quick in most vehicles, but not in the Dodge.  I have plenty of room &amp; comfort for long road trips.  There is also plenty of cargo space and seating for up to 7 people which has come in handy a number of times.  
One of our favorite features is cup holders.  Count them &quot;9&quot; cup holders.  Got to love it.
I drove my sisters new 4Runner a couple months ago and it reconfirmed just how much I enjoy the Dodge.  The Toyota was small, uncomfortable, stiff, and had an underpowered V6.  I am happy to say, my sister traded in the 4Runner for a 2000 Durango just 2 weeks ago.

Cons:
My wife and I actually leased a 99Durango.  After 6 hours of negotiating we drove home.  After the weekend we realized that we were taken for a ride.  They wore us down in the negotiations.  We asked the right questions, but never received the right answers, just diversions.  Since Dodge has a 3 day return policy, we ended up returning it at the end of the weekend.  6mos later we knew what we wanted, stopped at a Dodge dealership on the way to Big Sur for the weekend, and was out of the dealership in 45mins.  We endend up paying retail for the truck 35K, they were asking 40K with dealer markup.  We are still working on our negotiating skills.

13mpg is my avg gas consumption, but I am demanding of my vehicles.

Service at the dealership requires patience.

Switching in and out of 4wd requires slowing down, putting in neutral,  and backing up to disengage 4wd.  I believe the 2000 model has an option for full time 4wd.

Front left fender flare adhesive partially came off after 15k miles

Fog light switch was worn after 20k miles, but service installed one during oil change<br><br>
