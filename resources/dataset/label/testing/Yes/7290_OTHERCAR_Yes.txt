            This digital camera is quite nice. I first got the chance to use it when working on the business department website for my high school. More recently, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and several friends all own one. All in all I know 6 people who have one and they all think it is very good.

The controls are easy enough to use, but not completely obvious. It took me a few minutes of reading the manual to figure it out.

The build in memory card has enough space to store about 130 pictures at a resolution you would normally take photos at, or about 20 at maximum resolution. Although there are many cameras with higher resolution than the 1280*960 this camera delivers, you really don't need anything higher for computer use. You may want something better if you have a high quality photo printer, however.

This camera is easy to use, just point and shoot. You can also do zoom, and if the picture isn't to your liking, there are a few advanced settings you can use to clean it up. 

The only bad part is how long it takes to load pictures through the serial port interface. Some people may prefer that though, because usb interfaces many times are unreliable and not available on old computers. Also, the battery life on the 4 AA batteries you use is almost nothing if you use the lcd display. However without the display on, the battery life is certainly adaquate.

The best feature of this camera is the price. Costing $250 on sale or $350 normally, you simply cannot find a camera that takes pictures this good in this price range. You can get a cheaper camera that is not worth having, or you can find a much more expensive camera that may not provide a whole lot more for what you pay for it. In all, this is one "sweet spot" camera.

Lastly, the included software gets the job done. I especially enjoy the included photo stitching software which allows you to combine several different shots into one picture automagically. All in all, this camera is quite a good package
