            I leased the 2000 Galant ES model after comparing cars for weeks and figuring out costs. I found that this one was the best value.  The treatment at the dealership was pleasant and unexpectedly friendly and prompt.
What I love the most about this car is it's solid quality and quietness.  You feel safe inside of it.  The exterior paint, fit and finish and body parts are of excellent quality (I have the silver one).  Then engine is well laid out and easy to work on, which will save you money on labor costs because the mechanic requires less time to do the job.
The interior is good and has gotten a lot of compliments from those that have travelled with me.  The dash and doors have wooden trim, the power windows are excellent, the antenna is hidden in the rear window and the controls are all easy to use.  The only complaints about the interior I have is the quality of the fabric, the fog light button is hard to reach while you're driving. The most unusual thing about the interior is that the ashtray has a light inside but the glove compartment does not!  Who wants to look at trash instead of glove compartment contents?
Driving this vehicle is a smooth experience.  I emphasize smooth because the ES model is not for hard turns or jack rabbit starts.  If you want quiet rides, smooth shifts, and barely felt bumps then this is the one, but if you're looking to outrun someone look into the GTZ Model.  Taking corners is &quot;at your own risk&quot;.  The car will hold but I wouldn't bet my insurance rates on it.  Braking could be improved as well, there is some noticeable fade.  My passenger side wiper broke during an ice storm but was replaced free of charge thanks to the excellent warranty.
This car is great for families of 4 and for those that like class and smooth rides along the country side.  I'm very happy that I bought it and it has much more personality than the Accord and of course much more appeal than the Camry.<br><br>
