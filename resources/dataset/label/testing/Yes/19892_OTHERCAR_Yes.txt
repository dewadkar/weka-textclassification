            Due to a slight change in professions, we needed a high quality SUV that would be good for driving long distances and be a good off road contender. The Mitsubishi 4x4 Montero Sport was not our choice. I liked its looks, it had good space, and given that Mitsubishi was brand new to the Canadian market, we'd have a unique vehicle. However, after sorting out problems with the dealership, we took it for a short test drive, and that just completely changed my mind. About a month later, we made our final decision and purchased a <a href="/content_87457762948">2003 Toyota 4Runner</a>. This does not mean that the Montero Sport sucked, it just would not have lived up to our needs very well.

The ES & LS models come with a 165 hp engine with 186 lb-ft torque, which is sufficient if you never get loaded down. However, we would have required the 197 hp engine with 223 lb-ft torque in the XLS and Limited models, as we would almost always be loaded down and need power for passing on highways and such. For the majority of SUV owners, the ES and LS would be adequate. The salesman mentioned something about Mitsubishi vehicles not needing as much hp as other vehicles due to the way the engine functions, but I can't help but disagree after the test drive.

The handling was one of the biggest turnoffs, as it is still quite truckish, unlike much of the competition, making curves feel quite tenuous. I would never feel comfortable taking corners at high speeds, and taking corners at high speeds is something I love to do. If you drive to simply get from point a to point b, then you'll be fine, but if you're like me and want to get to point b by having some fun then you should look at other vehicles. Jasonbopp claims in his review that it is sporty, but I think it is one of the least sporty vehicles I have ever driven. The ride is rather rough, but not much different than most other SUV's. The clearance is good, and not much different than other SUVs. We didn't get a chance to test its off road capabilities, but given the ride on-road, I can't imagine it is anything stellar. In Europe, where it is called the Pajero, it has a good off road reputation, and it is possible that it is in fact quite good. Most people will never even take it off road, so it really doesn't matter.

The salesman kept saying how it was such a quiet ride, but I didn't find it to be any quieter than the other vehicles we dealt with. I know for a fact that our 4Runner is quieter, so I don't understand why he kept talking about Mitsubishi's special insulation techniques. The stereo system was decent for something direct from the factory, and it did a good job of muffling out the noise.

The exterior styling is up to you, I like it and can always pick it out, but some people won't like it as with any design. The interior I thought was very well designed. There is a large glove box, a typical sized console, and a rear seat fold-down armrest/cup holder. The seats were comfortable, and the rear seat had good legroom. The cargo space is a good size, it would have been perfect for our needs; some people would prefer a 3rd row seat, but I think that's why the Endeavor was introduced. The dashboard setup is good, with easy to understand buttons and switches. The only ugly part of the interior is the white speedometer, which clashes with everything else. The interior design is what I feel is the Montero Sports biggest asset, with what's under the hood being the biggest detractor.

The Montero Sport is okay, and for most people it probably is ideal. The majority of people would probably want the XLS or limited models, simply because the ES and LS don't quite cut it. If you have more money to shell out, I would suggest the Toyota Highlander (4Runner if doing off road driving) or Jeep Grand Cherokee, as they are what I feel are the best contenders. There is also the Honda Pilot, but I have nothing good to say about the local dealer or the quality of our Hondas. A cheaper, but smaller option is the Kia Sorento, which impressed me a great deal, but was too small for our needs. There are many good alternatives, most of which I feel give you a better bang for your buck than the Montero Sport. I recommend you at least take a look at it, but I'm not recommending you purchase it.
