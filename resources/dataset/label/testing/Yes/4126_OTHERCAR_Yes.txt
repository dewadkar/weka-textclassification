             I have a 1991 trooper with 4 wheel drive, v6 and AC. I really enjoy the trooper. Not because of power or looks, but because it does what it is supposed to do. My trooper has 125,000 miles on it with no engine rebuild, it doesn't require high octane gas( the cheap gas is fine), I have no rust and it always gets me where I want to go. I have put 1,500 pounds of step stones in back and drove it home, built a 10x10 deck and all lumber fit inside and door closed and went on a road trip to Montana and camped in back with seats down.

 It's not fast(mine does around 100 before running out of power). Troopers come with a 2.6L I4 or a 2.8L, GM V6. Both engines are rated at 120 horsepower and torque is 146 for the I4 and 150 for the v6. A 4 speed auto is available and a manual 5 speed is standard.   

 The brakes squeak a little and I've heard most 91 and below troopers have that problem. Engine parts are easy to find and rebuilds are cheap(the v6 is a chevy motor) and you can even switch out engines from a mid 90s firebird(v6)if the time ever came and you wanted more power. There are many websites dedicated to the 91 and below trooper and many people own more than one, so finding parts and help with specific problems is readily available.

 With a 125,000 miles on the odometer I feel the trooper will go for at least another 50,000  before some engine work(major), as of now the engine is running like new with no pings, knocks or rattles. Gas mileage could be better(18 miles to gallon average). Get a trooper, change oil and filters, tranny and transfer case and you should get at least 150,000 miles out of one. There are always lemons with any car and I might have been lucky with mine, but I like it and like it a lot. The reason I gave the trooper a 4 was due to the low price you can pick one up for and how reliable mine has been. <br><br>
