            We purchased our first Camry in 1987 and it's been a love affair ever since. My wife named that one &quot;Samantha&quot; , it being her car. When we purchased a new 1989 Camry, I inherited the '87, and promptly named it Sam. We bought our latest, Samantha #3, a 1999 XLE last March. To us, Camry is synonymous with reliability and value.
We initially purchased a Camry because of the Toyota name and their reputation for building a quality car. The '99 XLE follows in that same tradition. The &quot;fit and trim&quot; of the car is excellent, as though it were molded instead of bolted and welded together. It has the look and feel of its cousin, the Lexus. With a V6 engine it's exciting to drive. I feel safer knowing that the power is there to move me when I need it. But if there is one thing that separates the Camry from others in its price range, it's the way it ages. It doesn't, or at least it's very slow. After ten years and over 100 thousand miles, one would expect to see a drip of oil under the car on the garage floor. Well, we've not experienced that yet.
Do I have a complaint about this car? Yes. I wish it were as roomy as my full sized pickup and could accommodate my 6' 2&quot; frame just a little better. Although the car has electric seat positioning, I wish it had &quot;seat position memory&quot; - my wife is barely 5 feet tall (short). Oh, by the way, all of our Camrys are still in the family and still being driven. That's quality.<br><br>
