            Pros- Very comfortable and roomy inside for large families or for carrying lots of cargo
2)  The engine has plenty of power for towing boats or towing camper trailers.
3)  The dual air conditioning system lets the people in front control their temperature, while at the same time the rear passengers can control their temperatures.  This is very handy while traveling on long trips.

Cons- 1)  Interior trim does not properly fit in the rear cargo area.
2)  Leather material on seats if of poor quality.  The seats began to show wear within a few months of being purchased.
3)  Fuel mileage is poor.  On the highway the suburban gets approximately 14 miles per gallon while in town only 9-10 miles per gallon.
