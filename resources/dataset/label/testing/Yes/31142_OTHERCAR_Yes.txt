            Well, Christmas fever must have struck my day, either that or he's having another midlife crisis or something more profound but he's shopping for yet another big-boy toy.  Of course, yours truly tags along at every opportunity to sample to goods as it were since, while I make a decent salary, 2kids and a spouse obliviate whatever hopes I might have of owning something more exotic than a Plymouth Voyager minivan...&lt;sigh&gt;

Well, he's narrowed down his choices, mainly due to the amount of money he want's to spend (about $50k) and his taste--but there's three major contenders; Dodge Viper RT/10, Plymouth Prowler and Acura NSX.  I've driven the Viper and and NSX, but not the Prowler.  I've heard more bad than good about the Prowler, but pop is reserving judgement 'till he takes one for a spin.

The NSX was kindof a shot over the bows of the likes of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, McLaren, RUF, et al when it was introduced to prove that a Japanese automaker had what it takes to build a supercar.  Did they succeed?  Well, yes and no.  And it's this type of indecision that will forever haunt the NSX and any other simular attempt by a big automaker--Japanese or not.  Performance-wise, it's got all the right stuff; 0-60 in about 5sec, 1/4mile in the mid-13's and just this shy of 300hp from a 3.1Litre aluminum V6 all wrapped up in a tidy 2 seat package. What it also has is maybe a little too much Honda and not enough........something.  Not sure what that something is, but it's like the car is sterile in a way that is the opposite of an Italian car's character.  Hope you can relate to that.

Driving the car was a great experience.  We had ridden to the dealership in pop's '82 DeLorean which is, on a good day, a claustrophobic experience.  Alot of that carried over climbing into the NSX, although there is *much* better visability, just not alot of headroom (A targa would have fixed that, but this car wasn't one).  Your right foot tells you that there's definitely 300 ponies on tap and the feedback from the steering was excellent.  Brakes were also very good, although pedal feedback seemed a tad vague at the limit (read 140mph CHP-induced panic slowdowns on the freeway).  But I digrees....  On with the review;

<b>The good</b>
There's actually so much good about this car, I'm just going to skim accross it here.  It's an honest-to-goodness supercar-class car that you can buy right now.  Matter of fact, outside of a Porsche911Turbo or SupraRZTurbo, I can't think of any other car that can be had in either this pricerange or this performance that would offer a simular level of comfort and performance (LexusGS400?? Ah, different class...).  Comfort is what you would expect from a top of the line Honda, performance is what you would expect from a high-output 3litre aluminum v6 in an aluminum chassis, handling is what you would expect from this caliber of car....matter of fact, just about everything is what you would expect it to be.  From the handling to the ergonomics, nothing is really out of place, surprising or unexpected.  Which now leads to;

<b>The bad</b>
No matter how you slice it, it's a Honda.  It lives, breathes, drives and acts like a Honda.  Control is light and precise.  The engine revs to the moon making that weird VTEC cam-shift thing towards the top end.  Everything inside is logically, almost conservatively placed.  The furniture your butt sits on is nice and supportive giving a great ride.  I'm almost tempted to say refined, but it's not a MercBenz or BMW7-Series type of refined....it's well, a Honda.  The behind the wheel experience isn't *that* far off from an RType Civic or Integra (well, there is this big HP, weight and balance difference, but normal driving is startlingly simular).

<b>Bottom Line</b>
If I were to honestly buy a car that could even be remotely classified as an exotic, the NSX would actually rate pretty high on my list.  Why?  Well, even though I talk as though being a Honda is a bad thing, it's actually not.  What that means to me is that the NSX is a car capable of keeping up with almost everything in most respects, including parking lot appeal and not just raw performance.  You'll also be able to realistically put probably 100,000+ miles on it and get close to 20mpg.  The only other cars that could most likely keep up with the NSX in those regards is the SupraRZ and the FD-RX7, neither of which are available anymore ('cept used of course), and neither of which are nearly as exotic looking.  I would go as far to say that this is actually a sensible super car.  The big downside to this sensibility is that the car lacks alot of soul compared to other cars in the class--including a couple of models by Lamborghini (see my profile).  But let's face it, you buy cars like this to drive, not to look at.  The NSX that I drove is definitely one of the most driveable exotics I've ever driven.<br><br>
