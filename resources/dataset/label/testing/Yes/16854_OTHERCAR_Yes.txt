              I run the National Center for Child Safety in Tennessee, and I bought this camera to use in schools and daycares in order to create ID cards for children. This entails literally thousands of pictures per month.  I purchased the FD-90 because it had the desired picture quality that I was looking for.  For the purpose of child IDs, this camera is perfect.  It is durable and the photo quality of a small driver's-license type photo is incredible.  
  However, I am not completely comfortable using this camera as the conventional family camera, capturing special moments and saving vacation memories forever.  Why? Several reasons.  First of all, most people would want to take special photos on the highest resolution.  While the highest resolution setting will take pictures that look rather stunning on your computer screen, printing them is another story.  A suitable printer that is capable of printing the picture at a quality you would want to keep would cost several hundred dollars.  Furthermore, at the highest resolution, the FD-90 will only take 3-5 pictures per floppy disk.  This means that if you are away from your vacation cottage for a day, you'll have to lug around at least 5 disks if you want to take 25 pictures. You can purchase a &quot;memory stick&quot; that will store about 60-70 pictures, but this is a very pricey option (all things considered, it will run you about $150 or more).  Not an easy task if you are trying to travel light--not to mention the size and considerable bulk of the camera itself.  
   However, if you are absolutely convinced that you want to go digital, I would suggest this camera over any other that I've tried in my business--which includes most in the Sony Mavica line.  It can do incredible things to photos by virtue of its myriad picture effects and shutter speed settings.  Charging the battery is easy and relatively quick--a completely run down battery can be recharged in as little as 2 hours.  If you buy this or any other digital camera with the intent of editing and printing many pictures, I would suggest that you invest in a good picture-editing software.  
  Don't be fooled by the MPEG movie feature: The resolution is low, and it generally only takes about 15 seconds of footage.  In other words, don't invest in this camera if you are thinking it can be both your still and motion camera.<br><br>
