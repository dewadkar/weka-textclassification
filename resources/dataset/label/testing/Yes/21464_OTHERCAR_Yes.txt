            I bought my 2002 XL-7 Limited last November, 2001 with the 4wd.  The main reasons I bought this vehicle are:

- Built on ladder box frame for greater strength unlike some car-based cute-utes.

- seats 7 yet the vehicle is not too large but the tradeoff is you can't really seat all 7 comfortably unless all are slightly smaller than average size adults.

- with 3rd row folded, there's a lot of luggage space. I remember fitting about 4-5 full size luggages plus couple of small bags in there to the airport.  And even more space if you fold the split folding 2nd row seats.

- speaking of seats, it's very flexible, 2nd and 3rd rows can both split 60/40 and 50/50 respectively creating a lot of possible configurations depending on cargo/passenger situations.

- part-time 4wd just rules off-road and snow conditions but you "MUST" use the 4wd under slippery/offroad conditions.  I did not know this when I first got the car before having had chance to read the manual, luckily I found out why very fast so I didn't damage anything.  Here's a link that explains all different 4x4 perfectly.

So I've stated as many points as I can remember that made the decision for me to buy the XL-7.  So, after I've brought it home and drove it for almost 6 months, here are couple of complaints I have:

- at highway speeds, wind noise around the A-pillars is pretty loud.  (the first vertical pillar between windshield and driver side window, and the 2nd pillar is between driver side window and 2nd row seats called B-pillar).  But after hearing/reading reviews on other vehicles, it seems wind noise is pretty common on SUVs but I've not personally sat in any others.

- with 3rd row up and 7 ppl fully seated, there is very little room left for luggage except maybe couple of small bags.  So if you want to go on long trips with 7 ppl, you'll need to invest on a luggage rack to put on the stock roof rails, or a luggage carrier for a hitch if you decide to put a hitch on.  Unless if you don't need to seat 7 ppl, you could fold 1 of the 3rd row seat up instantly create a lot of room and/or 1 of the seat at 2nd row.

- the stated mileage is about 17 mpg for city and 20 mpg for highway, but I've only averaged maybe 15 for city when I first got the XL-7 up to about 15-16 now with 4200 miles.  The most I got was 18.7 mpg with 3/4 highway and 1/4 of offroad fun.  I've read different things on mileage from people, some got great mileage right off the bat with brand new XL-7, some claim they got better mileage as they break the engine in.  Some say they had dealer check the O2 sensors.  with my 4200 miles, already changed oil once when I converted to Mobil 1 5W30 full synthetic with K&N oil filter, so it's pretty broken in, So I think at next oil change and major checkup, I'll have the dealer check the sensors, hopefully it'll finally get the expected mileage.

As for reliability, I only got my XL-7 for a few months so can't really speak anything of it personally, but from what I've read on Yahoo SuzukiXL-7 group, the XL-7 had been very reliable as well as from Motor Week's long term test of the XL-7 which is another great source of review on the XL-7 which I've put a link below.

For current XL-7 owners, yahoo group has been a great source of information for me, if there are other great clubs/communities for XL-7, please share.
