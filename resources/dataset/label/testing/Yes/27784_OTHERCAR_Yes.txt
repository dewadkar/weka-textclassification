            My wife and purchased this camera in November of 2000 when we decided to build a new home.  The main advantage of this camera was it's small size.  We found that most "Show-Homes" in our area don't allow you to take photos. The Canon Digital Elf is small enough to hide in the palm of your hand, virtually silent, and with the ability to turn the flash off, we captured some photos of excellent ideas that we were able to blend into our own home build.

<b>Quality Photos</b>
Over the past year, we've take in excess of 1000 photos. This camera has travelled with us to the Caribbean and on many back-country ski tours and has performed well.  At high resolution, the photos are of such a high quality, that we have had many prints developed at sizes up to 8x10 and framed in our home.  The images are crisp and clear.  Excellent colour reproduction and absolutely no pixelization when they are enlarged.

<b>Battery Life</b>
The re-chargable battery is a must for owners of a digital camera.  Yes, there are alternative cameras with similar or superior image quality to the Canon which are less expensive, but many do not feature the re-chargable power pack.  In my opinion, this is a must-have feature in a camera.  The battery rapidly recharges, holds a charge for weeks and has been extremely reliable over the past 15 months.

On the downside, if you plan to take this camera with you during outdoor winter activities -- keep it warm.  I believe the aluminum housing acts as a conductor of cold air, and in temperatures below -10C renders the camera useless in minutes.  In particular we have been unable to take more than 2 or 3 photos -- if at all -- unless the camera was kept directly next to the body.  The camera will signal a "battery discharged" notice and shut itself down.  Warm it up again for 15 minutes, and you can get off 2 or 3 pics once again.

<b>Photo Storage</b>
As purchased, the Digital Elf ships with 8mb of storage in the Compact Flash format.  This allows approximately 6-10 high quality images, or 45 low quality images. If you decide you want to enlarge and print an image to anything beyond 3x5, it has to be high quality or your image will be pixelized.  Highly recommend upgrading to a 32mb - 128mb Compact Flash -- allowing you 50-75 high quality images.  You can then keep the smaller 8mb media handy for overflow.

<b>Menu</b>
Finally, I've found the Menu system to be somewhat cryptic compared to other models such as the offerings from Fuji.  Nothing in particular to report here other than I've found that the menus and sub-menus don't seem to follow a logical flow, and I've had difficulty activating certain features.

Overall, excellent quality photos, relatively easy to use and reliable product from Canon.  Great for travelling, or sticking in a shirt or pants pocket to pull out and capture a moment.
