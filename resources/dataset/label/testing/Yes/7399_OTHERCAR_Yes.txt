            Let's just get it right out in front - for the money, there is simply no better car in terms of price to performance.  The WRX series delivers on all performance counts right from the factory, and, with a little extra cash, can move into competition class.

Where else can you pay less than $30,000 to go from 0-60 in 5.7 seconds?(<b>*</b>)  The WRX is a joy to drive and, even though it is my first manual transmission, I <B>highly</b> recommend getting the stick even if you've never had one before.  The clutch is forgiving, the shift gates are easy to find, and I'm now convinced that driving a performance car with an automatic transmission ought to be illegal.  Handling is superb; I've had friends who drive autocross take it out and have had to forcibly remove the keys from their pockets.

Comparing the WRX to the BMW 3-series and the Audi A4 does show both the strengths and weaknesses of the Subaru.  While it outperforms both of its primary competitors, and costs many thousands less, it doesn't carry the brand strength or the refinement of its European counterparts.  The WRX interior is, at best, average.  The standard sound system, while sporting a 6-disc in-dash changer, is weak and suffers severe bass-clipping problems.  Also, the exterior styling is of the "love it or hate it" variety.

I'm already looking into available modifications to the car.  The factory offers some fun gear:  17" wheels, spoilers and other styling goodies.  Also, the aftermarket is currently on fire with new exhausts, intakes, and other funky parts like "blow off valves", whatever those are.  But I'm sure they just serve to make a fun car even better.

<b>One Year Update</b>
I've been driving it for about a year now, and I've had zero problems with it.  Feed it gas and oil, and it keeps on zooming along.  Also I have to say that having a 3750-mile service interval vs. the 3000 mile that most cars have is actually quite nice - less visits to the dealer.

(<b>*</b>) I've also been informed that the Camaro SS, Firebird Formula, and Ford Mustang Cobra can also make these numbers for under $30K.  However, 2 out of the 3 will not be made after this year (2002).  But I concede the point.

However, if I amend the statement to add "and get 30 MPG and can be driven in the snow without ending up as a smear on a guardrail" I think my point is made.
