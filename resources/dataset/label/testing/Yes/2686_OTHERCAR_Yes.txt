                This great SUV has most all of the same features of the Durrango, Explorer and Grand Cherokee at a fraction of the price.  The above mentioned SUV's have a price that ranges from the mid 30,000.00's to the 40,000.00's.  The Mercury is fairly priced, with leather and all the fixin's for 28.000.00.  
     It is roomy and the back seat converts way easier then any of the other SUVs in it's class.  All of he seats are very comfertable and there is ample storage room in the back.  
     It rides surprisingly smooth considering it's fairly powerful engine.  It reminds me of a car more then a truck and is surprisingly quiet.
     If you are looking for a good quality, luxurious SUV and don't want to spend 37,000.00 then I suggest that you deffinatly check out the Mercury.  Take it for a test drive nd see for yourself.<br><br>
