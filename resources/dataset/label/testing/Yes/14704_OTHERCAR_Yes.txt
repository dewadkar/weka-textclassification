            I don't know a soul who enjoys car buying, and working with the dealerships can be a real bear!  We searched everywhere for the &quot;perfect&quot; car.  I wanted 4-wheel drive, or at least AWD, smooth ride, and room for our two growing kids.  He wanted affordabilitiy and decent gas mileage.  We had only purchased our used Jeep a couple of months before, found that it was NOT meeting the needs of gas mileage or a smooth ride.  I was pretty determined to not purchase a new car, but that was thrown out the window the first time we got behind the wheel of the Subaru Forrester!  It handled fabulously!  Could take corners great, PLENTY of room for the kids, dog, and camping gear.  Still has the capability to haul a small travel trailer AND gets nearly 10 MPG more than our Jeep did.  One of my favorite features is it is always in AWD so I never have to anticipate the need for 4-wheel drive, and there is never a need to mess around with high or low 4.
This is an all around GREAT car, and I would recommend it to anyone in search of an SUV.
