            Venture offers a comfortable roomy ride. I took my Venture on a trip from NY to FLA. Very nice ride good air conditioning handles road well. Good fuel economy. Handles well in heavy rain. My model has rear Captain seats which make it difficult to get into rear seat unless you tilt seat forward by pulling release bar. Kids enjoy their own music system which allows them to listen to their music while the adults listen to theirs. Rear AC helps keep van cool even on very hot days. My van has been brought in for service about 10 times in 1 year for minor problems such as rattles, problem with automatic sliding door, leak in sealed beam headlight. Overall I am happy with the van.<br><br>
