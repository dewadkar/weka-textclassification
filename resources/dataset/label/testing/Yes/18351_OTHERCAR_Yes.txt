            We call it the "RoadMonster" because it (94-96) has the LT1 260 hp (when stock) and is so large. When I was a kid, I heard that a Buick was a smart man's Cadillac. I still believe it. I prefer the looks of the fleetwood brougham, but my wife likes the buick's looks better. It's her car, so she's happy.  She also likes to embarrass the mustang 5.0s with it. Bone stock this car runs 14.7 second quarter miles!  And talk about a ride!!! Don't know if I've been in something smoother. Great factory stereo. We have the dove grey interior, which I think is best. Only reason to buy a 95 or 96 is for the bigger rear view mirrors. Otherwise, I don't know of any differences.Watch for block ac drains, because when they get clogged, it gets all wet on front passenger floor. Easy car to work on (but rarely needs it), and parts are waayy cheaper than a ford/lincoln product.  Also, has a lot more punch than the towncars weak 4.6 liter engine. Both cars get 25 mpg on the road, too. These cars aren't very plentifle, because they are so good, and built to go 300K miles (have the same drivetrain as chevy police cars).
