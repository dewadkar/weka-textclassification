            Ford has been my preferred vehicle brand for some time and this year was no different.  I purchased a 2003 Ford Taurus Centennial Edition.  The Centennial Edition is basically an SEL Premium with a few extra goodies such as chrome body-side inserts, the former "SHO" aluminum wheels, and all of the Centennials are black.  

This Taurus is my 5th Taurus since 1990.  I traded a 2001 model in on this one and received a $750 military rebate plus the X-plan price plus a $1000 rebate plus 0.9% financing.  It was a great deal and helped absorb negative equity in my 2001 Taurus.  

The reason I like the Taurus so much is they have a very 'heavy' feel to them, but yet they are quite nimble on the road.  I feel like I am driving a larger car than I actually am.  The car feels (and is rated) very safe and has frontal and side curtain airbags.  It is a roomy sedan - being 6'4" tall, I need all the room I can get and the Taurus affords it generously.  It has a nice ride - slightly firm, but not harsh.  It handles and performs strongly for an average family sedan with the 3.0L Duratec 24 valve engine.  The vehicle is appointed nicely with wood trim on the steering wheel and dash.   The seats and door panels are trimmed in leather.  The SEL Premium and Centennial Editions are also fully loaded with power everything.  

The things that disappoint me about the Taurus are:

1) Brake Rotor Vibration - every Taurus I have owned suffers from this problem and many other owners report the same.  
2) Wheel / Tire Balancing Problems - Both my 2001 and 2003 were driven off the lot with tire balancing defects at highway speeds.  In my 2003 they had to replace the tires to correct the problem.  
3) Small defects during initial ownership - If you purchase a Taurus, be prepared to make several 'little' trips to the dealer for trim fit and finish, noises, rattles, minor electrical issues, etc. for the first 20,000 miles or so.  This has been my experience with all 5 Taurus's.  These issues are nothing major - and could have been avoided with a little quality control at Ford.  Beyond these issues, the Taurus will run strong for you for a long time (my 1990 Taurus up to 160,000 miles and it had been run extremely hard).  
4)  Depreciation - The Taurus must be one of the world's fastest depreciating cars!  The rental car market is flooded with them and this doesn't help (unless you are buying a used one).  I paid $21,000 for my 2001 SES and got $9600 for it in 2003 in trade for the Centennial.  I checked the internet blue book and that was right on.  

Conclusion - you won't find Toyota fit and finish in the Taurus, but surprisingly, the Taurus is not a boring car.  It drives like a nice touring sedan, feels great and looks rather stylish for a family sedan.  With all of Ford's rebates and incentives, you can get into a well-equipped Taurus for around $17,000 - fully loaded to the gills for around $25,000.  Finding a comparable car in this class with the features is difficult in this price range.
