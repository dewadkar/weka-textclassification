            Most people when they look at a Probe, they think, &quot;Piece of Garbage,&quot; but not true.  I just totaled my 1991 Ford Probe GT and I must say that it is one hell of a car.  

Never did I wake up in the morning to find out that my car decided to not start, especially if I was running late to work.  Every time I put my key into the ignition and turned, it started.  Not many people recognize the Probe as being a sports car, right?  You probably don't think of it as one either, I know I didn't.  I saw the car sitting in Hamilton Chevrolet's used car lot back in February of '98 and it caught my eye.  It was actually a very clean car for being 7 years old and it was worth a try to at least look at.  I didn't think that it was going to be anything special when I ask the salesman if it was possible for me to take the car for a test-drive.  But when I got in it and pulled out on to the road to find out that the car was actually really quick, I fell in love with car.  

Stock, the 91 Probe GT will run side with the Mustang GT, loosing by maybe a half a car length, which was not bad at all for a 4 cylinder.  The car does have a Turbo that helps but not enough, it only pushes about 6psi out of the turbo and it can withstand 15psi.  I had mine pushing about 12psi, and was it quick.  I put in a waste gate override which allowed me to control the amount of boost I wanted my car to push out by turning a needle valve open just a little bit, and I also bought some Monza Performance Exhaust made especially for the Probe.  Stock the Probe will run about a 15.8-16.1 in the quarter mile, and with these two modifications, I was running a 14.8 in the quarter.  The waste gate override cost me maybe a total of $10-12,and took me about 2 hours to install, which is well worth doing to the car.  I got the idea off of a web page, which is http://www.crosswinds.net/~bmj9975/probe.htm.  It is very useful for a first generation Probe owner.

I highly recommend this vehicle to someone that wants a car that is sporty, comfortable, quick, and most of all, dependable.
