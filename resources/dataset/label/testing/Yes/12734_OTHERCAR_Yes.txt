            Okay so my title is a bit corny...but gets to the point.  Why would you look any further after test driving a Quest?  My opinion is a bit biased as I have owned 5 Nissan vehicles and just loved them all.
 
After tossing in the bass speakers for infant seats and the cruising for family vacations I decided I would also throw in the sporty car for the family minivan.  I know...you've all said &quot;NO WAY&quot;!  But it really isn't that bad once you get in one and check it out.  We bought our first one new, right off the lot and paid a little less then sticker price for it.  It was a basic model but boy was it nice.  Then we went to a used but nicer model on our second purchase. 

It is such a nice van with fewer drawbacks then the other models of vans we looked at.  It has wonderful seating, so comfortable, which really makes those long trips so much nicer.  Our model has the lumbar support (adjustable air pillow thingy) on the drivers seat as well as the automatic adjustment controls for moving the seating, which is on the front passenger seat too.  It has two captains type chairs in the middle instead of the bench seat, which I think makes it easier for the 3rd seat passenger to get in and out.  It has the dual controls for the radio as well as the air conditioning system so that the passenger can have a different temp or listen to there radio selection on head phones.  The passenger windows are tinted and so is the sunroof.  The sound system itself it great for a family vehicle.  The CD player is an added option that was on the one we purchased and is great on trips for the children's &quot;new&quot; music.  Do they even know what tapes are?  

The Quest rated high on the safety standards and now comes with the option of  integrated child seats.  It comes with airbags (ours was drivers side only) and anti lock brakes.  I really think that if you are looking for a van that matches price with quality you need look no further then the Nissan Quest.  And with normal upkeep it will last for a long time...I would venture to say longer then most mini vans.  Our immediate family now own 3 Nissan's Quest and 3 other Nissan models, they loved riding in ours so much they bought there own. 
I hope your 'Quest' leads you to a Nissan dealer and may your search stop there.  <br><br>
