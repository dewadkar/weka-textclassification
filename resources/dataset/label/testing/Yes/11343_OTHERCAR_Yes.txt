            I purchased my Dodge Caravan in May 1999 and already have 20,000 miles on it.  I used to own a Jeep and loved it too, but always wanted a van.  From the first moment I took the van for a test drive, I knew I had to have it.  I have never had any problems with it.  Except that I drive a lot and gas is so expensive.  

I love the idea that I can take out the middle seat and move the back seat up (or) take out the back seat depending on how many people I will have in the van.  My son is in cub scouts and we go camping.  It is so great to actually be able to get EVERYTHING I need into the van and still have room to spare.

I know I haven't had my van very long, but even with 20,000 miles on it, I have never had to bring it in for service.  There have not been any problems with it at all.  I highly recommend this van to anyone interested in purchasing a van.

The only thing I would change with this van is the space between the far back seat.  My son is only 8 years old but is a big kid, when he sits back there, there is not much leg room.  There is enough room to sit back there, but he is a little cramped.  

Other than that, I absolutely LOVE my van.<br><br>
