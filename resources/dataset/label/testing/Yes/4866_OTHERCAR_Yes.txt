            While my initial review may have been a bit more skeptical for the price/performance ratio has come more into line with what you should expect at this price point. I purchased this camera as my first "serious" digital camera. I say serious because my previous digital camera experience was with a worthless pencam. 

My first impression of the S5000 was the way it felt in my hands. Although the entire body is plastic, the weight and feel of the build quality is good. While many people complain about camera weight, I personally like a mid-weight camera. 

The multiple shooting modes are a blessing for those who don't want to meddle too deeply into the finite settings of the camera. Fuji went the extra step and threw in the threaded tube adapter so you can attach additional lenses. 

Another plus on Fuji's side is the 10x optical zoom. At the current prices, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a 3 megapixel camera with a 10X optical zoom. On a similar note, don't think anything of the "22X" logo emblazoned on the side of the tube adapter.... it's pure marketing trickery when the actual optical zoom and digital zoom are combined. The digital zoom is essentially worthless from my testing as the picture quality plummets once beyond the optical range. 

The overall image quality is very good. I couldn't be more pleased. The 2 second delay in shutter response will take a little getting used to for anyone who is not adept at taking shots. This delay will also dampen hopes of some trick photography by users. 

Overall this camera is a great tool for snapping family pics, extending your reach in digital photography, and great for pushing your creativity. My use tends to go from macro photography for my eBay sales, to personal use, to business use. I try to keep it with me at all times. At the price it's currently selling for ($399 after my last check, maybe less by now) it definitely needs to be considered a contender if you need something beyond just point-and-shoot use.
