            With a new baby in the house, I needed a digital camera to help me capture "moments" all day long. My key criteria were image quality (I'm old-fashioned and wanted to be able to get 35mm-quality prints from my digital shots to put in an album) and light responsiveness (I wanted to be able to take unobtrusive shots of quiet moments like baby sleeping or waking up, without using a flash).

This camera has satisfied those criteria completely. Even if the only use I ever got out of it was the 400 or so photos I've taken of our son his first 2 weeks of life, it would be worth it.

And I say that as a guy who is coming late to the digital camera game. I have shot 35mm for 20 years, and last year got a medium format (large negative) Mamiya camera that is stellar for high-level photography.

But for day-to-day use and for ease in capturing the moment with something that fits in your pocket, I have been so impressed with the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P72. I got mine for $300. I felt the price was a bit high when I got it, but now I see the value.

I read a lot online before choosing this camera to buy. I almost went with a Kodak EasyShare, but steered away from one of those because I'd read they break down more. The most impressive thing about the P72 is its ability to make low-light shots shine. I don't love the way its flash shots look -- a bit harsh, and with strong flash shadows. But natural light shots with this camera will amaze you. You won't be disappointed with this camera.
