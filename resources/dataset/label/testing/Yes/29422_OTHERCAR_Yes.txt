            An affordable Porsche?  Such phrases conjure up ideas of the world ending and the millenial signs of the apocalypse, but in reality Porsche DOES offer a model that some would call &quot;affordable.&quot;  The Boxter has been in Porsche's lineup for a few years now, and just when people thought that its razor sharp handling and crisp linear steering couldn't get any better, the &quot;Man&quot; at Porsche decided to up the power output by about 40 Stuttgart horses.  
The base Boxter is already an over-achiever in the handling department, but with the extra horsepower this small convertible approaches the zen levels of top down motoring that its bigger brother, the 911 cabrio, helps to define.  The horsepower increase also catapaults the Boxter into the range of such icons as the Chevrolet Corvette and BMW M Roadster.  While I will always remain a Corvette faithful die hard American, I must give props to the German crafted Porsche.  
The Boxter is everything a roadster should be, and to top it all off it has 2 (yes 2!) trunks with which to haul luggage for a weekend getaway.  If you have the largeness to dispense such sums of money without thinking about it, then this is the toy for you.  I of course, would recommend the Corvette, but for the people who's bank accounts will barely ripple with the purchase of a car like this, the Corvette may be all too plain.  The Boxter is the practical Porsche and quite possibly, the most perfect Porsche.
