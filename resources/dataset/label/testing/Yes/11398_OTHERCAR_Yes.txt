            My husband and I just purchased a 2000 Toyota 4Runner last week.  This was one of the best decisions that we could have made.  We also own a Corolla and traded in a 4x2 pickup.  The quality and reliability of Toyota has kept us very loyal to this brand.  Let me tell you about how we came to purchasing this vehicle.

We had been casually looking for a new vehicle to replace the truck that we had.  It was 12 years old had had seen better days.  So, we had gone to our local Toyota dealer and started looking at Camrys.  I have always liked how the Camry looked and we kind of liked the idea of having 2 cars instead of a truck(you get asked to help move friends less often with a car).  My husband had started looking at the trucks and called me over when he seen a 4Runner that he liked.  I reluctantly went over to look at it and never turned back.

When we took it for a test drive, I drove it around for several miles and soon fell in love with the feeling of being up high.  I felt like I could see the traffic around much better than in a car.  When looking at the trucks that were on the dealers lot we really didn't see a truck that had the options that we wanted and was in a color other than black or green.  So we had gone in to speak with the sales manager to see if he could locate one that was to out liking.  He found one coming in a week from that day.  We took it.  

I really like the way it handles.  I always feel like I'm in control of the truck and although it drives differently that a car does it is a very smooth ride.  It does take getting used to driving a much bigger vehicle.  The seats are comfortable and the driver seat has an adjustable lumbar support for those long drives.  My husband is 6'4&quot; and feel comfortable when driving, sitting in the passengers seat and even in the back seats.  He has more than enough leg and head room.

Some of the things that I am not crazy about is the cups holders.  They are too small to fit my bottle of water in it.  So you end up holding on to it for the trip.  When driving on the freeway if you have the back passenger windows open it can be a little noisy and windy in the truck.  But unless you are hauling around a truck full of kids how often do you have the back windows open.

Some of the options that we got on our 4Runner are moonroof, front bug guard, running boards and the package they call the Sport package.  I really like have tinted windows and a 6 CD player also.

Before buying this truck we had looked at Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chevy Blazers but the quality and reliability just weren't there. Sure the prices were a lot cheaper but I would rather spend the extra money and know that we would have the quality that Toyota has become famous for. I know that in the long run we purchased the best vehicle out there.

I would recommend this for everyone. It is an absolutely great truck :) 

UPDATE:  We have now put in our first tank of gas and figured that we are getting about 19 miles per gallon.  Not great but it was more than I thought that we would get.  Toyota claims that the estimated mileage is between 14-20 mpg.
