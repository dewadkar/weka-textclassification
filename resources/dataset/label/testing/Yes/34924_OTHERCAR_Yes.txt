            Highly recommended. I opted for the dealer installed leather package which makes takes the van to a new level of luxury. Very happy with the powerful V6 VTEC. 
Very smooth ride, excellent handling. I recommend this for anyone looking for a family of utility vehicle. I also loved the way the middle seats slide into a bench, and the way the rear seats fold down into the floor. 

I had one issue with the Vehicle: When you are sitting on a hill at a light the van will roll back there is no roll back lock which most cars have these days. I've gotten used to it and actually like the fact that I dont have to shift in reverse to roll back when I'm parallel parking. 

We bought the Odyssey because: Its a Honda,its large size, the very powerful engine, and its great styling in and out. I had to pay way over sticker for the van since the demand for the vans in San Francisco is so high. But the dealer also took my old dying passat in trade so i was happy to pay an extra 3k especially when they threw in the leather seats.            <br><br>
