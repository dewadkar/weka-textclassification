            My review of the 1984 733i is based on being around the car since my dad bought it new on December 1983 up until today, since I now own it and it has become my daily driver.

First, a little background on the 1984 model.  The 7 series had a slight styling change for the 1983 model year.  The famous "shark nose" that BMWs had become known for became a little more upright.  The chrome mirrors were replaced by black units and the wheel style changed as well.

1984 was the first year (in the US) where the 733i came with power seats, full wood trim (above the glove box and below the radio - where the ashtray resides) and the optional 4 speed automatic.  Prior to that year, buyers had to do with manual seats, a lot of plastic and either the fantastic 5 speed manual or the 3 speed automatic.  It was also the last year for the 733i in the US, 1985 saw the arrival of the 735i, which only had 1 more horsepower but quite a bit more torque.

Our 733i has covered just over 123K miles since my dad drove it home that night in December.  Since that time, the transmission has been replaced once (at 98K miles) and other minor things have either worn out or been replaced just prior to failure.  Has it been a "cheap" car to own and operate?  Not in the least.  Was it worth it?  Every single mile.

Performance:
When you drive the 733i today you see how far luxury BMWs have come.  The 181hp engine cannot accelerate anywhere near as quickly as today's luxury and near-luxury sedans. Heck, it can be outgunned off the line by the lowliest of econoboxes.  Back in 1985 or so, I did race a friend in a Honda CRX Si, which was a hot little number then, and it was a very close race. However, once you're on the highway you will find the pick up is more than adequate.  Fuel economy is also not that great.  I average between 18 and 21 mpg but in all fairness, that does involve a lot of 80mph cruising.

Quality:
The build quality of this car never ceases to amaze me.  All the materials still feel rock solid to this day and the body has shown no signs of rust during all this time.  The car has zero rattles inside.  My '98 Mustang GT had more rattles after one month than this BMW has shown after almost 18 years.

Reliability:
All things considered, the 733i has done everything we have ever asked for and never let us down.  Not once has it left us stranded and it always gets the job done, comfortably and safely.  However, the transmission was rebuilt by a friend back in 1988 and was then replaced by a new remanufactured BMW unit in late 1999.  The engine is the epitome of smoothness and reliability.  It's no wonder that BMW has become so well known for its inline sixes.  The biggest problem area with these cars (E23s) is the dreaded HVAC system.  There can be numerous problems with the vacuum hoses which are buried deep inside the dash.  

Even when it's working at 100%, the A/C has to be kept a high fan speed to keep the cabin comfortably cool in the summer (especially down in south Florida).  However, tinted windows and a little creative parking (i.e. look for shade whenever possible) will get you through the summer just fine.  This problem was corrected with the more modern E32 7 series introduced in 1988 in the USA.

The car is also very technically complicated.  It was one of the first to literally computerize a large number of functions and because of that, there can be very minor little annoyances that can be rectified by a good BMW mechanic.  A good search on the web will bring up many sites describing the typical BMW E23 7 series foibles.  Membership to the BMW CCA is also essential.

Overall I can say that I am very satisfied with the car.  It's old and feels sluggish when compared to modern cars, but when you're driving down the highway at well over the national speed limit, the car gives you a sense of security that is seldom matched by lesser cars today.  This car clearly shows that it was born to be an autobahn runner.

Prices for these cars can be ridiculously low, but if you're seriously considering buying one, please make sure that you have it checked out by a competent BMW mechanic that knows the ins and outs of E23 ownership.  That $1000 bargain you just picked up could easily double and triple in price as you take care of the little things.  However, properly maintained examples can, and will, run to 300K comfortably.
