              My best friend owns this car. And I would advise if you want to buy this car, buy it about 1-2 years old. It's a smart idea because the price is soooo much lower and the quality is still the same. The BMW 7 series hasn't changed much. I mean there is only one difference between the 1997 and the 1998 bmw 740il. The difference is that the 1998 has a glass sunroof, whereas the 1997 doesn't. I like this car because it includes plush leather and all the extras. It has very comfortable seats and the handling is excellent for a larger car. Just incase you didn't know, the difference between the 740 i and the 740 il is that in the il you have more space (leg room) in the back. I like this car because it has a great stero system. My friend bought his car 2 years old with all the extras. He loves it, and so do I. It costs a lot though. So if your looking for a new car at a bargain, don't look here. But if you want a 2 year old car at a bargain, look for the 7 series BMW because the value depreciates so fast in the first 1-2 years. After that though the car will still be worth a lot for a long time.<br><br>
