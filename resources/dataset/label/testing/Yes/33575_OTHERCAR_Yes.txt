            I love:
-------
Driving this car gets me aroused!  Before buying, I test drove the Mercedes E320 which is a great car.  The 528i made me feel 25 yrs. old, the Mercedes 50!

Watch the speedometer though.  I got a $150 speeding ticket 2 days after I bought the car for doing 63 mph in a 25 mph zone and I didn't even realize how fast I was going.  The officer had this &quot;Think you're hot sh.. in your new BMW, huh?&quot; look on his face as he gave me the ticket.

Long drives are great - highway or country roads.  BMW has adjusted the amount of engine noise entering the cabin to &quot;purr&quot; by just the right amount to give you feedback without being intrusive.  Sometimes, I turn the music off and just listen to the engine - something I've never done with any other car.

With one passenger and in the &quot;sport&quot; (3) drive mode, I can drive very aggressively considering the engine is only 190 HP.  It's important to maintain the tire pressure to spec. and to check the tires when they're stone cold. It really makes a difference in the handling.

The brakes are as good as advertised.  They've saved me from near disaster several times.

The controls on the steering wheel are VERY convenient.  When I drive my friends' cars, I REALLY miss them. I realize how much safer this car is with this feature.

My friends smoke and having ashtrays in the back is nice.

This car looks SEXY and people notice.  Although I didn�t buy it so that other people could admire it, I do feel good when people stare.

I hate:
-------
You get free &quot;regular&quot; maintenance for 3 years. Great right!  Yeah, but my front brake pads and rotors had to be replaced after 2 years &amp; cost me $400.  I didn't buy the maintenance program but it�s probably worth it.

In the 28 months I�ve owned the car, several &quot;small&quot; problems have occurred and have been fixed under warranty:
1. The first week after I bought the car, the driver�s side vanity light wouldn�t go out because of some &quot;bad&quot; wires.
2. The ski sack lid in the trunk wouldn�t close after I used it the first time.
3. Once the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light came on because the &quot;crankshaft sensor&quot; failed.
4. Once the airbag light came on because some other sensor failed.
5. After about 2 years, the steering wheel started emitting creaking sounds.  Turned out to be a noisy &quot;slip ring&quot; which had to be replaced.  Now about 3.5 months later, the creaking sound has started again.
6. The rubber door seals deteriorated and tore and had to be replaced on all doors (twice so far).  Apparently this will keep recurring because of the quality of the rubber.  I wonder how much it'll cost to fix after 3 years.

This seems like too many problems for a car in this price range.  In the 4 years I owned my $22K Camry, I never had a single problem.  Not ONE.

The stereo absolutely sucks! My 1993 Camry had a MUCH better system.  For some reason BMW decided to put in VERY cheap speakers and an underpowered amp.

Want to replace the amp?  Tough! BMW uses a proprietary bus (called I-bus) to connect the head unit to the amp.  This means that you can�t use just any aftermarket amp because the head unit won't be able to signal volume changes to it.  You would have to replace the head unit AND the amp which means that you lose the steering wheel controls which will only work with I-bus compatible equipment.

Want to get a wiring diagram anyways?  Tough!  It�s guarded more closely than nuclear missile launch codes.  Bottom line is that they want you to buy their &quot;premium&quot; system which also sucks.

Acceleration can be sluggish if you have 3 passengers and a full trunk.  If you like to drive aggressively with a full load, consider the 540 model.

The only really comfortable seats are the optional (in 1997) 16-way Comfort power seats.  They're well worth it if you want to really enjoy your long drives.

I smoke and the front ashtray placement is extremely poor.  It's difficult to find without taking your eyes off the road and after a while the butts really start to stink so you have to clean the ashtray every two hours or so.

Overall, I really love this car despite the problems I've experienced.  I can't wait for the M series!
