            It's always about quattro; always about traction, for me.
This Audi A6 uses  the latest form of the Audi Quattro with EDL, a system that uses the anti-lock brakes to maximize traction on slippery surfaces.

As always, Audi produces a high-quality auto, the only problem we've seen in 3.5 years came with the battery, and sunroof motor, which failed a few months ago and were replaced under Audi's bumper-to-bumper warranty, which included 80 miles of towing.  The motor had a short which caused the battery to fail.  Oh! A light bulb burnt out, which took 20 minutes to change.

The warranty covers everything on the car that wears or needs replacing other than tires and wiper blades for 3 years, which is very nice: all oil changes and maintenance are covered.

Back to the traction: exceptional.  Never any tire spinning, wet or dry.  In the snow: stomp on the gas, the tires brake loose, the car squats like a football player and jets forward, tires gripping immediately.  NO loss of control. Then, the ABS system stops it very quickly and sure-footedly.

The interior is gorgeous, with burl wood, leather, heated seats and a Bose stereo system.  No CD player here but it has excellent sound.  The back seat has room for all but the largest adults.

All the gauges are amber-illuminated, a soft red-orange that helps the nightvision rather than hurting like the green lighting so commonly used.

Steering response is excellent, with firm turning and good feedback from the pavement (or whatever).

Brakes are firm and stop on a dime.  They are a little dusty and the front wheels do get a bit dirty, but that's not a big deal to me.

The engine in this car is the 2.8 liter V6 12V, the last year Audi used the 12V engine.  It lacks low-end torque, and coupled with an automatic transmission, it doesn't do well in the classic "stoplight drag".  Around town, it rides well but is not terribly quick.  Get it on the freeway, however, and the tables are turned.  The car was designed for the Autobahn, to comfortably cruise at high speed and passing acceleration is excellent.

This model I speak of is the Avant version: a station wagon.  The rear seats fold down and there is enough room for just about anything.  It will actually fit two mountain bikes inside.

It's great for driving, but not for racing, after all, it is a station wagon.  A very classy ride that doesn't overstate its luxury.
