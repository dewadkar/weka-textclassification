            I purchased my Agfa 780c digital camera because I was looking for an easy to use and inexpensive digital camera.  This camera is so easy to use that my 10 year old uses it.  I bought my camera for $199 on America Online.  I work for a newspaper and after bringing my camera to work I found out to my surprise they use the exact same camera (so that should say something about the quality of it).  The one draw back in using a digital camera is that it uses up the batteries very fast.  If you just had a baby or want to send a digital camera off to college with the kids this is the one to buy.  Also one other tip if you are planing to print your pictures out make sure you have a good printer.  My printer isn't great and the pictures when printed don't look very good, which has nothing to do with the camera.<br><br>
