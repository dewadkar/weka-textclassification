            After test driving all the small SUV's this one stood alone in several catagories. Price being the most noticable, at $3,000 less than the Honda CRV while providing the same set-up and options.  The Front seat's are suprisingly comfortable (I am a bit wider than average), while the rear split seat's fold individually or as one and are stadium(stepped)style so all have a good view. The vehicle's entry level is perfect with no climbing or stooping involved.  I picked A/c and an Automatic transmission as options for an additional $1600. The A/c worked great, the controls are simple and easily reached. The Auto trans is on the floor and the shifter is a bit low but it works well.  
 There are several odd buttons on the dash and shifter that are not obvious what they control but the salesman explained them well and the owners manual went into more detail.
  I would buy another and have reccommended the Kia Sportage too family and friends.<br><br>
