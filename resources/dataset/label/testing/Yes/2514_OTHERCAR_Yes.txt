            As a Toyota Pickup owner I have never been displeased with the vehicle. We purchased the pick-up in 1991, it now has well over 100,000 miles and still runs like it is new. About a year ago we purchased a Mini-van as a second vehicle. Every dealer we went to tried to get us to trade our pickup in. One dealer even offered a trade-in value that was within $500 of the original purchase price. We won't part with our Toyota. <br><br>
