            I bought my 2001 Montero in April when they where first available. 
Actually I had a 4 month old 2000 Montero Sport Limited that was just fine. I just fell in love with the looks of the big Montero. So much to the pleasure of my 23 year old son, I gave the sport to him. I guess the main thing I like is the way it looks. It just doesn't look like any other SUV on the road. I just read one of the car magazines and they gave a &quot;C&quot;
in styling. My experience has been just the opposite. Ever place I go people are always telling me how good looking it is. When I first got it we created a back log at the local car wash. As for the ride it is smooth and quite. There is also some criticism about only having 200 HP. 
Well I for one didn't but a SUV to drag race. In the same test in the car
magazine the Montero won the race up a sand dune against 6 other SUV'S.
It was declared the most capable &quot;off roader&quot; of the bunch. On a recent 2500 mile trip my highway mileage was 19.1 MPG. I don't think that any of the higher HP SUV'S would be able to match that. The leather seats are soft and comfortable. The interior space is bigger that most, and with the seats folded down there is a class leading 96 CF of cargo space. I also like the new 5 speed auto transmission.The Montero is really a off road 
vehicle that most people drive on the highway, while the others are visa
versa. The 01 Monty is the best mix of both worlds.<br><br>
