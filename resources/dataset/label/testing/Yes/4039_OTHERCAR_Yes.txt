            The 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe has gone under a lot of changes this year.  THe regular models look nice, but I believe that for the money you are far better off buying or leasing the limited edition.  I currently have a 98 Tahoe and will be changing to the limited edition Tahoe within the next 5 months.  THe limited comes with a list of extras including body styling, rims, custom grill, and a list of luxury add ons.  The limited  performs just as great as the regular edition tahoe.  The Limited edition costs only a 100 more to buy per month and about 30 more a month to lease.  I feel that the extra 30 is wort the extra looks that you will get while driving.  It looks different to regular Tahoes and it looks far better than the regular edition.   The only problem is that it takes a lot of gas.<br><br>
