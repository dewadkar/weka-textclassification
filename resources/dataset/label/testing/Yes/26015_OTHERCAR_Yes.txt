            I recently bought a 2000 Cavalier w/the sport package, which gives you the 4 speed automatic tranny w/traction control, tach, &amp; spoiler.  I traded in a 92 Cavalier RS w/85,000 miles.  The main reasons I bought it were reliability (previous experience)&amp; price.  I got the $2000 rebate &amp; $2700 for my trade.  I leased a 2000 Pathfinder earlier this year, &amp; it didn't leave a lot of room in the budget!  I also wanted to get rid of the other Cav while it still had a little trade-in value left in it.  Not to mention needing tires, a pending inspection &amp; smelling anti-freeze through the heater.

I like the look of the car w/the spoiler on the trunk &amp; the BRIGHT red color.  The hub caps aren't a bad look to complete the exterior.  I wash my cars twice a month (at least) &amp; it cleans up nice &amp; fast.  The interior is pretty similar to a 96 Sunfire GT I used to own.  It's basic &amp; simple w/a rear defroster, intermittent wipers,&amp; a pretty loud CD player.  I'm actually giving up my &quot;after market&quot; stereo gear for it.  The trunk is very roomy, the rear seat folds down,&amp; it has a cargo net. I'm 6'-1&quot; tall &amp; the legroom is so so. I drive 31 miles one way to work every day, it's easy to drive,&amp; it's a fun little car for weaving in &amp; out of traffic.<br><br>
