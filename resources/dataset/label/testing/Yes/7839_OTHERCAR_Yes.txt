            I just recently turned in my leased '97 Isuzu Rodeo.  I picked it up in August 1997 with 37 miles on it.  Drove it out of the dealership parking lot and immediately the check engine light came on.  I turned right around and after sitting in the service dept for about an hour it was determined that it was a faulty oxygen sensor.  I thought for sure that I picked a lemon and that I was going to be plagued with problems, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I have had 3 great years with my truck.  I babied it, so whoever has it now has practically a brand new vehicle. (I even left the protective plastic over the mirrors under the visors-pathetic I know!)

What I liked most was the sporty look at a great price.  It is such a sharp looking SUV.  My friend has a '95.5 Rodeo and I fell in love with his, so I had to get one.  At that time, I was just out of college and needed a new car, but didn't have that much money to spend.  The Rodeo fit the bill perfectly.

My only gripe is the power or lack there of.  I had a 5 speed, so I don't know if the automatics are the same, but there was definitely a lack of power.  If you only use the truck for normal everyday driving it's fine.  It's great in the snow and rain, but don't try to pull anything uphill.  I did several Pony Club events in Connecticut and getting up the hills was a struggle.  Thank goodness I wasn't the one pulling the horse trailer!!  We would never have made it.

All in all, I would definitely recommend the Rodeo.
