            All the other reviews have summed up the great features in this camera- sleek sexy design, fully featured for all skill levels, great overall performance.

As such, I am just going to mentioned the 2 things that bothered me, 1 of which was a show-stopper.

1. The camera cannot be mounted as a removeable drive on Windows PC's (it can on Macs.) The Zoom Browser (name?) software included is pretty good, but transfer of images is slow. I'd like to bypass the program and just copy files directly. This is not a big deal though.

2. Slow lens. The Powershot has a f2.8/f4.9 lens (f2.8 at wide-angle, f4.9 when zoomed.) Unfortunately, this was a big problem for me.

I do not like using flash, and mostly take pictures of my 1 year old daughter and other people. Unless lighting is very good (daylight), many pictures are blurry due to subject movement or movement of my hands holding the camera. This is often unavoidable when the camera is taking photos with exposure times of 1/10 seconds or so.

You can compensate for this by upping the ISO, but this introduces artifacts into the picture.

This is not a big problem for most, so I will rate the camera accordingly. Most will probably leave the flash on auto and let the camera decide when to use the flash. But unfortunately for me it made more sense to find another 3 MP camera, or stick with my old 2 MP camera (clear 2 MP shots are better than blurry 3 MP shots.)
