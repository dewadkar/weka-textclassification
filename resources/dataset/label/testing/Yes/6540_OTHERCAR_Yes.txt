            We have a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan.  We bought ours the year the two sliding doors became standard and we haven't regretted it for a minute.  

We bought the van because we were expecting our second child and knew our 2 door Sentra wasn't going to cut it anymore.  Since we bought our van we've enjoyed the two sliding doors.  It makes getting the children out so much easier.  It is low enough to the ground that they can climb into the van by themselves, but the seats are high enough (with car seats attached) that they can see out the windows.  The windows offer great views for children because they are nice and wide and also some protection from the sun because they are lightly tinted.

I like driving the vehicle because I sit up high enough to see what's going on up ahead.  Obviously not around tractor trailer trucks, but enough to gauge the traffic.  Ours came equipped with a CD and cassette player, which means I have my music and can also play the children's music too (most of which come on cassettes).

We've had minor problems such as interior lights dimming without explanation. Most of the problems have been fixed by changing a fuse.

I definitely recommend this for anyone who has children.  There is lots of room for kid &quot;stuff&quot; in the storage area and Grandmommies and Grandaddies can ride along too!<br><br>
