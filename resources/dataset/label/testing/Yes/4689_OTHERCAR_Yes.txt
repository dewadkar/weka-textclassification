            I had a 1998 Tacoma, I loved that little truck, 4 banger and all.  I was curious and made the mistake of taking a V8 extended tundra for a test drive.  That was it!!  I stepped on it to get into traffic and had to take my foot off the gas to stop the wheels from spinning, I went to pass and felt more than enough power on tap to get me in trouble with the local radar traps.  The ride is very quiet and very nice for a such a large truck.  The ride is close to that of my friends Land Cruiser.

The biggest draw back I have found is that with that power on tap, its fun to use it and when you use it the miles per gallon stay in the 15 miles/gallon range.  The second biggest draw back is the limited leg room in the back seat.  The good news is that 3 full sized adults fit comfortable on the bench seat in the front.

The controls are easy to use, there are plenty of cup holders and power jacks for laptops and cell phones.

The truck is comfortable, makes me want to just drive around and play CD;s and enjoy the ride and the occasional need to use the V8 power.  I am sure that hauling is no problem for this truck, but I dont do any hauling.  
Hey, remember there is room to negotiate on these bad boys, dont settle for one dealers word on how far he can cut... I had 3 dealers bidding for my business.. I saved ALOT off the sticker!

What can I say, quality, form, fit, function..... Its a Toyota, a full sized, eat your friends full sized Chevy pickup.  I know I had some kid hit the gas on Chevy... I am 36 and I know... grow up.. but sometimes... needless to say the Tundra was in front when the lanes went from 2 to 1 !  Did I mention how good it looks too??
