            I owned a Lexus before... Having this Lexus was my dream since I laid my eyes on it. I have 2 kids, and bought it as a family car. I chose it over ALL SUV's out there in a even SIMILAR classes, for just 1 thing: VALUE! Why You all ask? Let's examine...
1. This car is the ONLY SUV that has only 3.0 liter engine, end STILL PRODUCES 220 HP. 
2. Thanks to its VVT-i(Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence), it produces 80% of total power at low 1,600 rpm
3. 7 speaker, 190 Watt system, with CD changer in the GLOVE DEPARTMENT
4. ALL the windows are automatic down AND UP
5. all 3 mirrors are automatic dimming
6. All BEAUTIFULLY done leather seats
7. All time all wheel drive... Even 3 wheels slip, 90% of the poser is transferred to 1 that doses NOT...
8. in 1 year of driving, I MADE 18 Miles per gallon on average, unheard of almost any 6 cylinder SUV
9. Lights are unbelievably bright
AND THE CAR STILL COSTS LESS THAN $40,000...

However, if u have more than a kid, then this car could NOT be the best choice... The reason(s) is/are...
1. rear seats are not too wide... 2 child seats, and only 4-5 year old could fit to the rest of the space...
2. Sometimes u feel that the car can use more power
3. When lifting the window, sometimes after reaching the top, window automatically comes down(15% of all cars have it... RX300-s that is)
4. Often wheel alignments are required
5. Expensive Service Costs...

In other words, in the scale of 1-10, I would give this car 7... Would I buy this car again if I never did? The answer is probably NO... BUT, I would go with Volvo S80, Which is NOT a SUV. however, currently, I do NOT know any other more practical SUV out there... however, if u have the time to wait, AND some extra money to spend, I would wait for BMW SUV, first car of which has been sold in ebay.com(first time any car company did this) for $143.000. BUT, do NOT worry, expected MSRP for Beemer is $55,000
