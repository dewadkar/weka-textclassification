            This is the second opinion of the Focus that I have written, here is an update.  I have over 8000 miles on the car now and the car still runs as good as the day I bought it.  The only complaint I have now is I wish I would have gotten ABS brakes because I have nearly avoided several collisions because of the power brakes locking up if I had to stop abruptly.  I think Ford should make ABS standard on the vehicle, like all the other cars that they (Ford) produce.  That is currently the only complaint I have.  The Focus is a fun car to drive and &quot;it can take a curvy road and turn it into a straight one.&quot;  It handles curves and turns very well I guess that comes from it's European heritage, tight and precise steering.  This car will fly it will do 120mph so far.  The car has finally caught on in my area, I don't go a day without seeing one, but it still turns heads at the traffic lights!  The car is still a great car and friends are also thinking of getting one also.  The SOUND system in this car is magnificent!  When tuned properly it has so much bass and it just sounds really really good, especially when traveling on the interstate and have the automatic volume control on its max setting, it will rattle you.  For those who do not know what the Automatic Volume Control is it raises and lowers the volume of the radio in relation to your speed and road noise automatically,  you set it once and you virtually never have to touch the volume again.  My stereo is matched with a nice SONY cd changer, and you can put the changer under the front passenger seat if you like, there is plenty of room for at least a 10 disc like I have.  There is not many places to put the controller except for the floor console at the base of the shifter. I will say the rear leg room is not for a tall person, if you have a Contour it is the same.  A person of about 6 feet will do fine.<br><br>
