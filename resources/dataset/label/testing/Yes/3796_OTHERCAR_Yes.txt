                  I think the M3 is a very nice sporty coupe with a V6 240 horse- power engine, 6 speed manual transmission, which also has a great traction control system . I believe the M3 runs with the Mercedes Benz &quot;CLK&quot; models(which are also nice), but I personally have always liked bmw products over Mercedes products, without taking away from Mercedes for quality or mechanical purposes. I like the M3 convertible the best because it fits my young, quick, and fast lifestyle. Everyone should be able to enjoy the luxurious life of owning a fast BMW M3 sports coupe. This is one of the only real competitive street racing cars you can pick up for under $45,000 brand new.  <br><br>
