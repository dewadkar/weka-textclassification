            I recently bought this digital camera mainly because of its price.  I wasn't expecting super-high-quality images from this camera, considering it was less than 1.5 megapixels, but I was extremely surprised to find out easy, fun, and convinient this camera was!  To top it all off, the picture quality was great!
The first thing I noticed was how easy the camera was to operate.  There are two modes: capture and review.  Capture mode is where you take your pictures, then you switch to review mode to see what you've taken, and to send the photos out to a computer.  Everything operates with the touch of a button, and you can easily delete photos or change settings from the on-screen menus.  Sending the photos to your computer is also extremely easy.  Simply plug in the included cable and press one button!  The included serial cable is extremely slow, however, and the camera only comes with 2MB of internal memory, which is both annoying (since it's non-removable) and too small.  I purchased a 16MB card with my camera which allows me to send the photos to my computer with a USB cable, which is much quicker.

Something else I've come to find is that the camera's flash is extremely bright, no problem with night pictures!  During the day, however, it can be too bright, and your pictures will come out with just white on them from the flash.  Again, it's very easy to use, so you can turn the flash off with the push of a button.

A big feature of digital cameras is the ability to see what you've taken immediately.  The LCD screen is small, yet does the job.  The screen does drain the batteries extremely quick, though, when you are using it.  It is bright and clear, and you can even take pictures by just looking at what's on the screen, not the viewfinder.

Overall, I love this camera.  Although the pictures cannot be enlarged (they'll be blurry), it does what I wanted it to do, allow me to take digital photos!
