            A lot of my friends have varying tastes in cars. One bought one of those Japanese model two door sedans, and it suits his purposes just fine. Another appears to be pining away for a Toyota 2000 Supra, for one reason or another. I for one mused what it would be like to buy a 1982 DeLorean that I saw on ebay.com, or this neato dark green MG convertible I saw at a gas station two miles away.

But alas, unless we come into a lot of money sometime soon, none of us will be the epitome of style anytime soon. But that's OK. Suddenly it hit me. The answer was right under my nose the whole time. The family Volvo 240 1984 Station Wagon (gray). Ultimately, it's the man that makes the car. Would the Batmobile be suited for anyone but Batman? Probably not. I for one would feel like such a dork driving the Batmobile in broad daylight.

The Volvo is really my kind of car. It's kind of funky, and I admit I grew quite attached to it. For one thing, I'm the only one that drives one, especially in my age range demographic. So in that way I love the unique nature of it. You can put lots of junk in the back -- mine even has a portable seat in the cargo section that you can raise if you happen to be bringing loads of people somewhere.

Perhaps the best part about my grey Volvo 240 1984 Station Wagon is the furtive nature of the automobile. For some strange reason, nobody seems to notice me. Sometimes people even pull into my lane while I'm still in it! That might sound a bit dangerous, but I'm a defensive driver from N.Y., so it's really no big deal. This characteristic is at its best when you're on the freeway. As Kenny Loggins says in the Top Gun theme song &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, just &quot;shove it into overdrive&quot;! I've done 80 mph in this car, even in the presense of highway patrol cars (what can I say, I don't see 'em till it's too late ;) ), and they just pass me by! They eventually find some guy my age in a two door sedan, or some stuffy old guy driving a BMW doing 75. Sometimes I feel bad. Oh well :)

My Volvo is my Millenium Falcon, really. I mean, I kind of look like Han Solo sometimes when I bring my dog with me, she kind of looks like Chewbacca -- scruffy-looking, and all. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy -- err -- New York State ;)<br><br>
