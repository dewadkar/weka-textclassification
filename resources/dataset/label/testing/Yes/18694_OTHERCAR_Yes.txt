            This camera has great image quality.  Manual control over most settings make this an ideal camera for the &quot;pro-sumer&quot;.  Consumers looking for a high quality point and shoot style digital camera would be better off looking at something like the Sony CyberShot F55.  But if you need manual controls, an optical zoom and high resolution, this is a good choice.  Personally, I preferred the Nikon CoolPix 950 over the Olympus C2000 because of the swivel lens design and easier interface (the Olympus was a little confusing at first).  As with most digital cameras, the memory included - an 8MB SmartMedia card in this case - is not the most generous and you'll likely finding yourself investing in extra storage in the near future.  The Olympus also has a couple of design flaws that I would like to mention - 1) turning the camera on extends the lens and pops off the lens cap - be sure to attach the lens to your strap or you're sure to lose it and 2) the power button is situated on top of the camera by the shutter release - I accidentally turned the camera off many times instead of taking a picture.<br>
