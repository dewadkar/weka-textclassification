            After using several digital cameras of different manufacturers I have found the Sony easiest to use. Containing a floppy that you simply slip into your &quot;A&quot; drive of your computer sure beats laboring over wire hookups every time you want to see or download pics.  Picture quality is excellent and Sony's reputation lives up to their name with reliability.  I have used this product for two years without one ounce of trouble.  Again, this camera comes out on top for many reasons but the ease of use is why I recommend it!<br><br>
