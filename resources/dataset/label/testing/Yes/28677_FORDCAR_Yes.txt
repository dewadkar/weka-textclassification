            I recently purchased my company's third Econoline van in 5 years. The new 2000 model improves on what has been a reliable workhorse for my firm, as well as providing LOTS of space to advertise...our E-250s are nearly 23 feet long!

Our first van was a '94 E-150 - loaded with practically every option available in a workvan - cloth captains' chairs, AM/FM/Cassette, AC, full carpet, metallic paint, etc. We do quite a bit of driving here, so I wanted to be sure that the vans were comfortable for the long haul. I also believe, as a construction safety consultant, that my vehicles need to be safe AND &quot;attractive&quot; enough to illustrate the point that &quot;Safety Pays&quot;.

The '94 now has about 130,000 miles on it, and it has had it's share of mechanical problems - probably the worst of which (in terms of obsolescence) was a leaking rear seal at only 65,000 miles. For the uninitiated, that means the transmission must be dropped to make the repair...the total bill came to around $900 - fair pricing, considering extra work performed, but still too much with that few miles, as far as I am concerned.

We just put another $1300 into it - brakes (all four), tie rods, exhaust, water pump, timing chain. To be expected at this point in its life cycle.

I originally purchased this vehicle with the smaller 8 cylinder (the 5 liter), in hopes that I'd save some money on gas - which, at the time was true of the smaller block engine. Since then, however, Ford has introduced the Triton V8...WOW!

More horsepower, pound for pound, and better gas mileage...with the heavy driving we do in the summer months, and carrying laptops everywhere we go, we use the AC ALL the time. Now with the larger 5.4 liter motors we have less wear and tear on the engine and still get better gas mileage (16-18 mpg) with the larger E-250s that we've added to the fleet.

The first E-250 (heavier payload capacity, as well as the &quot;extended length&quot; option - 22 inches longer than the standard) is a 1998, it now has about 40,000 miles on it...and I have had no complaints (if you ask my salesman, he'll tell you THAT means something). One of the nice things about the latest vans from Ford is that they include (at a very limited cost) built-in rack and shelving systems...perfect to keep you organized, and a bunch easier than installing yourself (as I did with the '94.) The only real problem with the racks (particularly the protective curtain that goes behind the driver and passenger) is that they are so close to the front seats, limiting travel on the seat adjustment. At 6', I feel just a bit cramped...

The 2000 (with 250 miles as of today!) is beautiful...Ford has done some extra soundproofing, apparently (the loudest thing in the truck becomes whatever you store on those shelves...be sure to invest in tool-box liners!). They also resculpted the engine compartment, giving a little more breadth in the leg areas, and allowing easier passthrough to the rear. It now has four cupholders (for java bingers, I presume) as well as very cute (but entirely functional and handy) change slots. The ride has been improved so much that, if these things weren't so gargantuan, you'd think you were in a car.

I have never purchased an extended warranty on a vehicle before now, but the number of miles we put on and the necessity of having our vehicles up and running all the time prompted me to spend the extra $1100 (still cheaper than that rear seal repair, I figured) to buy coverage to 5 years or 100,000 miles. Its a gamble, and I'm assuming that Ford has improved on past mistakes, but it is nice to have that piece of mind...

The size of our vehicles can also be a hindrance, especially on jobsites....they can be tough to maneuver, and REALLY difficult to back up. Naturally we have backup alarms installed, but we are now also trying a backing sensor (after-market, I'll do a review after I've tested it a while) on the new vehicle. So far, it works wonderfully, and very accurately (it beeps and gives a visual signal as you go through 9, 4, and 2' from the object behind you)

Although I've had some issues with the 94, overall I would say that our experience with the Econolines has been excellent, and I would definitely recommend them (but try one on for size first if you are over 6' tall!)

Remember that our vehicles are VERY well equipped, and the price reflects that. These are actually relatively affordable vans, considering what they can give back to you. When we originally shopped for vehicles, I tried the GM and Dodge products as well (I grew up with Chevys), but the Ford won. Now, it would be very difficult to get me to change.

And I'll post a location for all of the interior shots of the new vehicle once we finish &quot;customizing&quot; in a few weeks<br><br>
