            I've been an Internet user for years and have only begun to see the popularity of webcams a year back or so. Everyone and their mother had their grainy pictures plastered in one place or another of this virtual realm, but where was I? Faceless, nowhere to be seen (oh, the drama!) Then I bought a webcam so I can do the same. After using that for about a few months, I find webcams to be of somewhat low quality and generally produce pictures that are unattractive, which led to my purchase of the <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I>. It was a fine choice and soon, I had no use for that pitiful webcam. This digital camera is easy and fun to use and it's also very convenient. The price, one may think, is a very good price - at $150 or so, it sure beats out the other entry-level digital cameras in the market. 

<b>&#151 In the Box &#151</b>

The <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I> digital camera comes with the following things to get you set up and ready to go: 

* <I>The camera itself</I> - a silver, lightweight (5.1 oz.) photographic device with simple navigational buttons

* <I>8 MB SmartMedia Memory Card</I> - a lot to say for something so tiny 

* <I>USB cable</I> - a short cable to transfer the image and video files into your computer

* <I>Software CD ROM</I> - nothing too fancy here; photo transfer/printing software and drivers

* <I>Instruction manuals</I> - for those who can't figure out how the camera works just by looking at it

* <I>Two AA batteries</I> - the ones provided are not very useful, but a nice gesture nonetheless

* <I>Wrist strap</I> - needs no description

<b>&#151 The Specs &#151</b>

<b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I> is a <I>1.3 Mega-pixel</I> camera, and trust me, 1.3 Mega-pixels is quite enough for everyday pictures. Being rather small with dimensions of <I>3.9 x 2.5 x 1.6 in.</I>, you can easily fit them into your pocket or purse. The listed specs are: auto exposure, auto/manual [6 modes] white balance, 4 modes flash system, a fixed focus and 2.0X digital zoom with a focus range of 2 feet to infinity. On the back of the camera is a 1.6 inch color LCD screen for a decent view of the images. For picture quality, you can choose to photograph at 2 resolutions: <I>Fine</I> at 1280x960 and <I>Normal</I> at 640x480. There's also <I>Basic</I> in 24-bit color. You can also capture about 20 seconds of video at 320x240 resolution at 10 frames per second. I wouldn't really recommend that since the resolution is fairly poor and there is no sound. There's also an extra feature called the <I>Fuji Advanced Color Technology</I>, designed give your pictures better color depth and more detail. In addition, the camera easily doubles as a webcam using your USB cable and port.

Whew. <I>On</I> to the review: 

<b>&#151 What the hell is so great about it? &#151</b>

<I>Easy Interface</I> - <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I> has very user-friendly interface, meaning you won't have to wonder what all those buttons are for. Seeing the more advanced digital cameras with a thousand little buttons makes me afraid - what if I pressed something and it breaks??! Well, no worries here. Just a quick run-through of the manual and a bit of tinkering around will get you comfortable with how the camera works - and you'll be taking pictures in no time. 

<I>Features</I> - The features are very basic since it's a point-and-shoot camera, but I've had no troubles so far with what it has. The pictures rarely come out over- or underexposed and it has a very good focus. The red eye reduction has never been put to use since I haven't had run into that problem. The LCD display is big enough to get a good view of the pictures and <I>everything just works well</I>.
 
<I>Quality</I> - As far as picture quality goes, the <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I> definitely met expectations. As soon as I was out of the electronics store, I started snapping photos of everything I see and went home to view them on my computer. I'm no expert at photography, so I don't know much about lighting and exposure and what not. Even the subjects of my pictures tend to be rather stupid, but everything came out bright and highly detailed with beautiful contrast and true to life color. Even at lower resolutions, there wasn't something amiss. You'll be able to fit a lot into a single picture and retain good quality. 

*(See bottom of my review for links to sample photos.)

<I>Software</I> - The camera comes with a software bundle with the required drivers and basic programs to install. For the use of transferring and printing your pictures, they're simple and serve their purpose. There's nothing extra here to titillate, so if you want something advanced, you're on your own. 

<I>Transfer</I> - The file transfer via the USB cable is quick and painless, taking no more than a minute for the full 8 MB memory card. The pictures are in the common JPEG format, so you'll be able to view and edit them in any photo-editing program. When you connect the camera to your computer and turn it on (hehe) the <I>FinePix Viewer</I> program will automatically launch to transfer and display your photos. You can then save or delete at your choosing. 

<I>Memory</I> - The included 8 Megabyte memory card may not seem enough for those who like to take high-resolution pictures, but the great thing about digital cameras is that they're film-less. Once you've transferred the pictures to your computer, you can erase the card and use it again. If you prefer to take more than a couple of pictures at a time, I'd recommend an upgrade to a 32 MB or 64 MB memory card. Take note that the Fuji FinePix A101 only uses <I>SmartMedia</I> memory cards.

<I>Extras</I> - If you're looking for more, the <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I> can also be used a PC webcam as mentioned earlier. This is especially useful for those who like to broadcast their lives online or videoconference. 

<b>&#151 It's not exactly perfect &#151</b>

<I>Battery Life</I> - The problem with digital cameras is that they tend to drain batteries, especially if you frequently use the LCD display. I've probably used up about $30 worth of batteries to take less than a hundred pictures with the <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I>. I just wasn't smart enough to get rechargeable ones. So the lesson here? Don't be stupid like me and get rechargeable batteries, but don't forget the charger. 

<I>Durability</I> - The camera has a light plastic body, which makes it at risk for breaking in the event you drop it or bang it against something. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with a carrying case to protect it, so it's a good idea to get one.

<b>&#151 I'm almost done &#151</b>

To bring this review to a conclusion, I'd recommend the <b><I>Fuji FinePix A101</b></I> digital camera to soccer moms and dads, partygoers, novices, students, freaks and geeks, the young and old - anyone who likes to take everyday pictures. Don't expect to get the latest, biggest, baddest technological gadget - because this is not one. It's been out in stores for a while now, but it's still a nice camera that will suit all your basic needs and compete with the rest of them.  

Thanks for reading,
