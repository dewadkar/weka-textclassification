            I leased this vehicle immediately after having had an accident with my Acura legend and was drawn to the I 30 because of driver/passenger front and side air bags.  My initial attraction was safety and peace of mind and frankly, a bit of snob appeal at not too high a price.

I've grown to love the engine's pick-up and space conditioning system; but I wish the car had more style and pizzazz. I also find  the odometer to be virtually useless because, if I ever figured out how to make sense of it, I wouldn't be able to see it, particularly in daylight driving.

The car is ideally suited to long drives and can comfortably accelerate and maneuver at your command.  The non-upholstered seats, which initially felt too hard to be comfortable, actually are a plus for long drives.

If you want a high performance, snob appeal vehicle that is comfortable, safe and reliable for long trips by all means get this car. If you're looking for a sportier style you may want to look elsewhere.<br><br>
