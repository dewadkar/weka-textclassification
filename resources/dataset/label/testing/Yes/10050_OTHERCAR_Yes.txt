            I love my ES300 for its ride and luxury features.  Side air bags and ABS are standard safety items.  In fact, right after I got the car, I had to stop very, very suddenly; the ABS definitely saved a wreck (and a heart attack).  The trunk is very roomy compared to the earlier models.  I know you can carry at least 3 golf bags, and possibly a 4th if you pack carefully.  

The engine idles at about 500 rpm and you can't hear it.  After the initial transmission pause when you step on the gas, the car has great acceleration.  The leather seats are very plush and the interior, while "quiet" still gets road/wind noise on the highway (or 'boombox' from a nearby car at a stoplight).  I expected a dead sound interior from the ads, but it's still pretty quiet.  The standard stereo sound system is very high quality.  Smooth ride, great handling, and an unexpected short turn radius.  Except for the transmission the car is a very quality vehicle.

About a month after delivery, we took a 2400 mi round trip to Florida where the transmission/shift problems manifested themselves.  We averaged 26 mpg for the highway portion of the trip and 22 mpg city, excellent for a luxury car (and it burns 87 octane).  However, it was well below the 29 mpg highway and 24 mpg city expected from the window sticker (and the salesperson's hype).  Still good, just don't believe the window stickers.

I generally concur with Brian Moody's review on the automatic transmission "confusion", but I'd like to add a little more based on my experience.  Brian discounts the transmission shifting problem as "annoying".  I want to say it's a real problem.  Not only did I experience the shift confusion at the 35 to 40 mph speeds, but also when turning the corner at about a steady 10-15 mph and then trying to accelerate, and at highway speeds.  At the slow speeds I'd get a definite hesitation, similar to the older cars with a bad carburetor accelerator pump.  I've also experienced the problem when in cruise control at 65-70 mph in hilly terrain.  In traffic around construction where you have to inch along at 10-15 mph, I've experienced a definite "chatter" as if the transmission is trying to shift but can't engage.  I think it's a real problem, not just an annoyance.  Who knows what damage is occurring.

During my Florida trip in March 2002, I experienced the whole gamut of transmission shifting symptoms and took it to the dealer when I returned explaining the problem, but he couldn't confirm.  I then documented all the conditions that I could and returned it to the dealer in August, 2002, and he confirmed the symptoms and told me they now knew of the problem and there would be a Technical Service Bulletin issued in the next 2 weeks.  I called the dealer periodically after that only to be told it's "being held up in Legal".  It's been nearly 10 months since the TSP was identified to me.  Since then the dealer has told me there are 25-26 others with the same problem, but the hold up seems to be in "Legal", in the dealer's words.  Based on the comments to my review, it appears the transmission/shift problems are universal and Toyota is ignoring them.

As an aside, I have written commercial software programs and have never used an attorney except for copyrights.  I'm suspicious that either the "Legal" holdup is a ploy to put me off, or, they are concerned about some legal ramifications for the transmission problem.

Update: 12/15/03  Dealer finally fixed the transmission problem in September and I don't notice the shifting pause any more.  The acceleration might be a little more sluggish though.
