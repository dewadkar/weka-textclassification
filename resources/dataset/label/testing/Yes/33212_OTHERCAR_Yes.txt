            I was still in my late teens when my father took me to a dealer and let me test drive my tan Legacy.  On first instinct, I thought it was a little on the ugly side. I was still young enough that I wanted something new and sporty.  As I looked at it, though, I became more and more attracted to it.

<b>MY THOUGHTS</b>
My personal experience with the Subaru Legacy wagon has been wonderful.  When we purchased this car, it had nearly 80,000 miles on it.  I currently have it up to 145,000.  There have been no major problems with the automobile.  I have had to have somethings replaced, such as axles, break pads and other small things that would be expected on an older car.  
This car gets the best gas mileage of any car that I have tried.  On average I can get around 23 miles per gallon of gas.  That made the car worth it with all the driving I do.  Speaking of gas, the lid to the gas tank is attached so that when you unscrew it, it hangs from the car.  There is no way for you to leave it on top of the car and lose the tank lid!!  I love that feature!
<b>SAFETY</b>
I have had one accident since i was in this Legacy.  Another carhit me in the passenger side rear door.  I was hit pretty hard, but the frame was barely bent.  The damage done to the car was little enough so that we were able to get it repaired.  The way that the car held up was in such a way that if someone had been in the passenger seat they probably would not have been hurt badly.  Even though I was impressed by the safety, it's a feature that I hope I never have to test again.
<b>ROOM</b>
My Legacy has really become a blessing as far as how much room it has to offer.  My  husband was in a band for a long time, and so I was often the one called on to transport all of their equiptment.  Also, I have moved twice since having this car.  The rear seats have a lever that lifts upward to easily fold the seats foward giving you plenty of space for large furnature.  This vehicle has been ideal for long trips because there is room for your stuff and still plenty of room for you to stretch out and relax.
<b>FINAL THOUGHTS</b>
In conclusion, this car has been wonderful for me.  I have become quite fond of the Subaru line.  With plenty of room, awesome gas mileage and just all around comfort, the Subaru Legacy Wagon is an great choice.  I would recommend it to anyone.
