            I bought my second Nissan this summer, a 1991 Nissan Stanza.  After purchasing a 1988 Nissan Sentra new, 10 years ago, I decided to upgrade to an Automatic Shift with a few more amenities.  But for the record, the Sentra was the best car I'd ever driven, until this recent purchase of the used Stanza.<br>I've been buying cars for 40 years, and have always had American cars, being a GM and Ford employee over my working career.  But when a friend recommended Nissan back in 1988, I was never sorry for that purchase.  And the subsequent purchase of a used Stanza with 75,000 miles on it, last July has proven to be a very good choice.  I have had absolutely nothing go wrong with this car.  I bought it because it had automatic shift, which was my primary requisite.  However, along with that came a great A/C, tilt-wheel, push- button windows, cruise control, flawless exterior and interior, and an extremely comfortable ride, with mid-back controls in the driver's seat.<br><br>I get excellent mileage, and feel that this car is made for long highway drives.  It is a  comfortable smooth ride, the original equipment stereo rivals any I've heard, and the front seats go back to a lying position for tired passengers, or a driver needing a little break.<br><br>I think this is a great family car, just the right size, for a family of 4 or 5.  But I bought it as a single woman who does not know much about cars at all, and have found that I've seldom had to do much more than change the oil, and some normal muffler maintenance.  I would recommend it to anyone with basic good reliable transportation needs.  I expect to be driving it for at least another 100,000 miles.  It still looks brand new, believe it or not.  I'm sold on Nissans.<br><br><br>
