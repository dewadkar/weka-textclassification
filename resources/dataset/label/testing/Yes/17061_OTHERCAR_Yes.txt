            I purchased the 1997 Audi A4 1.8T with Quattro in June of 1997.  It took me more than six months of waiting to receive my choice of options and color.  And the waiting was well worth it.

At the time of purchasing the vehicle, I test drove more than 10 cars in or near its class. That included Subaru, GM, Ford, and BMW cars.  In the end, none of these vehicles beat Audi in overall elegance, feel, features, handling, and unexpectedly price.

For around $28,000, Audi A4 1.8T contains everything that I wanted - all wheel drive (which the dealer boasts that Audi lose money on each purchase just to promote it), sport package (heated seats, fog lights, sleeve for skis, and folding seats), and the basics.  In addition, the vehicle price includes regular maintenance service for the first 30,000 miles.  

The car does have three unexpected but minor problems.  

1. The brake often squeaks - The mechanics can apply a lubricant that will reduce the noise but the noise will return in a short term.  They blame it on its new metallic brake.

2. The remote car entry sometimes does not work, and no one can seem to find the problem.

3. The Audi car dealer, at least the one I went to, is a snobbish bunch of people. Personally, it was for the fact that they are the only dealer near me, I would happily choose someone else.

In summary, I love the car.  The car really stands out when driving on a paved, winding, uphill, wet road.  If you do decide to purchase the vehicle, definite get the Quattro (Audi's AWD system).  It's well worth the price.<br><br>
