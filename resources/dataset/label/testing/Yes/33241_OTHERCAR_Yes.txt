<TEXT>
            I have owned an E-10 for over two years now and it has only been in the past month or so that I felt I had anything unique enough to say about my E-10 to warrant a review. I could give you a history lesson about the importance of the E-10 in relation to price and features, or I could give you a technical review that focuses on the wondrous electronic marvels inside the case....but those have already been done. I think I can give an interesting perspective on this camera because I think I was very much the target buyer for this camera when it came out. I am an intermediate-advanced amateur camera buff and I used this camera as a stepping stone to elevate my photography to the point where I warranted the purchase of a modular digital SLR system from one of the "big boys" i.e. Nikon, Canon. So my review is from the perspective of someone who got the camera at a time when I didn't even know what all the functions did and now I am leaving it behind as I am finally outgrowing it (having used all the features to their limits). Don't get me wrong....it is still in my camera bag but it is more of a scouting camera than my primary machine....anyhoo, on to the review.

The Olympus E-10 is a "pro-sumer" camera that apparently targets those who have outgrown "point and shoot" cameras but are not fully ready for the completely modular systems  offered by Nikon or Canon. Its price falls nicely at the top end of the "consumer" brand cameras but falls comfortably enough below the "pro" end that you feel you are getting a bargain. In the end it doesn't fall neatly into either category. It is too well built and has too many features to be a consumer camera, but many of the "pro" features are somewhat more complicated to use than those found on "pro" SLR's. In addition, there are many limitations to the abilities of the camera that would turn off a "pro" or advanced amateur.... hence the term "pro-sumer".

     I am not going to list all the technical specs for you. There are many other reviewers who can do a better technical review of the electronics than I can. But I will list some of the more generic specs. The E-10 is a 3.9 Megapixel digital SLR with a fixed-mount 35-140mm (35mm equivalent) lens and a 2/3" RGB interlaced 2240x1680 pixel CCD. It has a 1.8" color view screen, and uses compact flash cards or smart media. It is not technically compatible with micro drives but some people have had limited success with them. Its aperture range is adjustable from 2.0 to 11 in 1/3 ev stops. It has a mechanical focal plane shutter with a range of 2 seconds to 1/640th second ( 8 seconds in manual plus a 30 second max bulb mode). The camera weighs about 2 lbs and is 5"x4"x7" in size. It is largely constructed of aluminum. Street price varies but is usually in the $1000 range. (May 2003)

    The E-10 has several image quality options, but the most important ones are 2240x1680 JPEG (2:1 compression..about 2.2mb), 2240x1680 TIFF (1:1 compression about 11mb), and 2240x1680 RAW (1:1 with-after camera white balance, contrast, sharpness correction requiring a Photoshop plugin...about 7mb). On a 128MB smart media card  you can get 46 JPEGS, 11 Tiffs or 17 RAW images. The camera is supplied with a 32mb smart media card standard.

These are the basic specs....lets go thru the camera 1 part at a time and get more specific.

----------------------------------

Camera Body---As mentioned before, the camera is largely made of aluminum with the exceptions of the integral flash, media door, and the various knobs and buttons, which are plastic. The lens barrel is rubber coated and the body is  powder coated in a matte black finish. In its basic form it weighs about 2 lbs and uses 4 AA batteries.

From experience I can attest to its overall ruggedness. I have abused my camera...tossed in the car and left it there on long trips left outside the bag. I have left it in the heat, the cold and then used it in the snow, rain and on the beach. It has held up remarkably well and even survived an 18" fall onto concrete with nothing more than a scuff.
      Without the optional B-32 battery pack/portrait grip I find the camera to be oddly balanced. It has a left-side biased weight distribution due to the lens position. With the optional battery grip ($300) the camera truly comes into its own. It has the solid heft and feel of an F-series Nikon. I have an F4s and both cameras have the same quality feel. The right hand seems to meld with the grip and the  hand strap that comes with the portrait grip makes the camera seems to be a part of your hand (although a heavy one :-)

------------------------------------------

LCD--- The camera has a 1.8" RGB-interlaced LCD screen with a "flip up" ability that vaguely allows for top-of-the-camera view finding. The LCD is used to navigate the many menus and options. In addition, it can be used for playback of images or as a digital viewfinder. The last ability might seem unnecessary but when you realize that the camera only has a 94% optical viewfinder but a 100% LCD viewfinder its importance becomes clear.It is necessary to use the LCD as a viewfinder when the boundary edges of the picture are of critical importance. It is also easy to check for camera tilt by using the LCD and seeing if the horizon is parallel with the LCD edge. Be careful...extensive use of the LCD leads to quick battery drain. 
     Another useful feature is to have the camera show each shot as it is taken (for 5 seconds). This gives you a quick opportunity to see your finished work and perhaps gives you enough time to refrain the shot and retake it as needed. This is much faster than going into playback mode to see if you got the shot, which could easily take 30 seconds.
-----------------------------------

Batteries--- If you use Ni-mh or Nicads in this camera you will be hugely disappointed with battery life. I once used up the large Lithium Polymer in  the optional portrait grip and I had to resort to store-bought Duracell Ultras... wow.. I got about 5 shots before the camera died.!!!! Good Nimh's should allow you to get 30-40 shots but for serious work you must by the optional Lithium-Polymer battery pack and portrait grip( about $300)  which will give you about 100 shots or more with sparing use of the LCD. If you can't use the battery grip then buy the Lithium Ion batteries that Olympus sells for use in their cameras. They are expensive ($25) but give similar life to the large battery pack. I always keep a pair handy for emergencies. There is a low battery indicator that appears on the LED when appropriate and if you use the optional battery pack /portrait grip the percentage of battery life remaining is indicated in the LED window.It is important to note that I leave the camera on all the time when I shoot and I refer to the LCD alot, so my battery life reports reflect a worst-case scenario. If you do not use the LCD you can expect considerably better results. There is also an external AC power connection if you have the liberty of using studio power.
----------------------------------------------

Metering-- The camera sports three types of metering methods: spot, center-weighted, and matrix. Spot metering is a hugely welcome feature since I use it heavily with my film SLR....so I am used to it. This is an example of where Olympus went the extra mile and included a "pro" feature in this camera. There is a small button to the left of the eyepiece, which is depressed, and then the command dial ( a large dial to the right front of the camera top) is turned to make the adjustment to the desired metering mode. Matrix metering is the default, but center-weighted or spot metering have icons on the display screen and in the eyepiece viewer so you know when they are activated. The metering works as it should and I liken it very much to the Nikon metering setup in my F4s. I  find both to be very accurate. Of course, the matrix metering has trouble with off-center subjects, extreme low light and extreme contrast situations, but every other camera I have used suffers from these same flaws. Matrix is great for "snap shots" and as a last resort when you aren't sure what to read off when in spot meter mode.....but serious work begs for spot metering.
--------------------------------------------------

Program Modes-- on the top right rear of the camera is the program mode dial. It includes the Manual mode, Shutter priority, Aperture priority, Program mode, Playback mode, Print mode (for dedicated photo printers), and transfer mode (for uploading pic to the PC. Attached to this dial is the on-off dial. All these modes are fairly self-explanatory and function exactly as you would imagine they should. 

     Program mode is for snapshots ( with a bias towards low aperture -high shutter speed exposures to allow for hand-held shots.) I have gotten some great shots with little prep time. With matrix metering this mode makes the camera a very capable point and shoot camera. This is a great crutch for the beginning photographer to build confidence while experimenting with other more manual modes.

     Shutter priority mode is for stop-action work although the 1/640th second top speed is too slow for my taste since it cannot stop many common motions you encounter every day (...cars etc....) I have a major beef with the 2 second-cap on shutter speed in Aperture, Shutter and Program modes. I constantly have situations when I am in Aperture mode when 2 seconds is not enough to capture the image. I have to switch to manual mode. In Manual mode there is an 8 second cap and I have to say that that is usually not good enough to allow for bracketing low lit subjects. The 30-second bulb mode is completely unsuitable for dusk/dawn work and I won&#146t even talk about night photography. I often have to sacrifice depth of field to allow for shutter speeds that fall into the sub-30 second range. And that's too bad because one of the best advantages of a digital SLR is the ability to experiment for "no cost except your time". This is not something that will bother the intermediate photographer but I mention this to stress the limits of the camera. Shutter speed is adjusted with the "command dial" ( a generic dial that seems to control practically everything on the camera)....weird, but it works well.

     Aperture priority mode is for tuning-in depth of field. The lens/CCD combination allows for massive depth of field already. In fact, the hardest thing to do with this camera is to blur a background due to its extreme depth of field. For very deep shots the max aperture of F/11 is not enough and is a major disappointment. I often am unable to force long exposures in brighter light. F/11 is just not closed enough!!! I have to pile on neutral-density filters and polarizers and even then I am usually disappointed with the results. Once again, this is not too annoying to the intermediate or beginning photographer, but it is a major drawback for the aspiring advanced or pro user. The &#147command dial&#148 also controls aperture.

Manual mode is very useful and the longer exposure times allow for a little more control of the shot, but there are no "bonus" aperture settings in manual mode. Metering in manual mode is a little different than I am used to. Adjust the shutter speed with the "command dial" then adjust the aperture with the Exposure compensation dial and the LED screen on the top of the camera will let you know when you've got it right. When using a remote shutter release this is a fairly easy thing since you can meter and adjust dials without really looking thru the viewfinder other than to pick a spot to meter. Performing the whole procedure entirely thru the viewfinder is hard. There is just too much to do and you can't really do it "blindly". I find I have to take my eye out of the finder to see which dial I have to turn to adjust aperture or shutter speed. Since I tend to only use manual mode when I am taking a well-planned tripod mounted picture with a shutter release,, this is not a problem. There is also a handy LED light that makes things easier in low light. I will mention bracketing and exposure compensation later... so bear with me as I finish the "modes" section.

Playback mode- use this mode to view your finished product. There is a 1.8" color LCD on the back of the camera that can be used to view the pics. The LCD is not very useful except to see if the exposure is "generally" right or to see if someone blinked at the wrong moment. You can get a general sense of composition and a general sense of focus but it is not useful for anything very critical. For experimenting it is great because it can be used to see if you are in the ballpark with the effect you were trying to get. There are two buttons below the LCD that allow you to delete or protect pictures while in playback mode. A 4-position arrow dial allows for navigating the images. It is possible to zoom on an image or view several images as thumbnails depending on how you set the menu.

Print mode-- never used it...can't say how it works. The manual says you can plug your camera into a dedicated Olympus printer via the USB cable and directly print pics. This is a great idea for a "point a shoot" camera that costs $100 but isn't good for anything better than 4x6's ...since I would want to see the picture on the PC at full size before I wasted that kind of ink and paper for an 8x10....   Anyway, I get my pics printed at the camera shop for a lot less money, so this mode is not of much use to me.

Upload mode- by attaching the USB cable to your PC and the camera you can upload your pictures to your computer. This works much better than previous digital cameras I have owned in that it doesn't require any software to make it work (at least in Windows 2000 or XP). Just plug in the camera and turn the camera  on and the PC automatically sees the camera as a hard drive. From there you can start uploading, downloading or modifying anything you want. A little hint....don't go renaming anything in the camera "hard drive"...just copy and paste the image folder to your desktop. Modifying folder names can confuse the camera and lead it to think it either has no images when it is actually full or the reverse. Upload times are about 4-5 minutes for 128MB. My understanding is that these times are limited by the slow reader on the camera itself, so I imagine a fast reader attached to your computer might speed times considerably. When I first got the camera a little over 2 years ago I was amazed at how fast it uploaded pics (considering the image sizes),but as technology improves this would now be considered a slow upload time.

It must be noted that the highest quality images are taken in RAW mode and this REQUIRES you to use Photoshop to process the images. Now everyone who is anyone uses Photoshop anymore, but there is a learning curve and this is one more hassle for the beginner to have to deal with, Luckily, 2:1 compression JPEGS offer lots of image quality for less serious work and should suffice until the photographer becomes more skilled with post processing images.

---------------

Lens------ the camera comes with a 9-36mm lens wide-angle zoom lens with ED multicoating. This equates to a 35-140mm 35mm lens. Since the CCD is smaller than 35 mm film, the lens focal-length is effectively different than if the same lens were used on a 35mm camera. The lens is not removable but there are 4 accessory lenses (all fixed focal length) that can be purchased.  The lens uses 62 mm filters and can accommodate 2 standard thickness glass filters without vignetting. 
     The lens comes with a plastic snap-on lens cap and an almost worthless lens hood. The hood always causes me grief (vignetting) so I eventually bought a Nikon hood. Leave the hood at home. Lens flare is so rare with this lens that I have only encountered it  twice and in both cases I left it in the finished print because I found the effect pleasing. 

     The lens has several focusing modes that help in different situations. There is a button to the left of the lens base that  can modify settings with the aid of the "command dial". Macro mode allows for closer than average focusing and I have had success with as little as 6 inches using the optional Macro lens attachment. Telephoto mode aids in focusing further off objects and is used when you attach the  optional Telephoto accessory lenses. A flashing telephoto setting is used in conjunction with the massive TCON-300 lens attachment which is almost as long as your arm but only offers 300mm of fixed focal length ( i.e. you zoom with your feet :-). Macro mode is the only mode you really need to be aware of with the standard camera. It really does make a difference with close subjects.
     Overall the image quality of the lens is first rate. I have no complaints considering the price of the camera. The basic lens covers 90% + of the shooting situations I encounter and all but 1-2% of those situations can be resolved by relocation to a closer or further shooting location. I think the lens is well paired to the camera and I have produced images that amaze even myself. If there is a limit to image quality it is more likely a CCD resolution problem and not a lens image quality situation. That being said....if you need to shoot outside the 35-140mm range on a regular basis the accessory lenses simply do not fill the gap and will disappoint you ( more on that later). For the beginner-intermediate photographer I feel that the lens is a great introduction to SLR wide angle zooms and the range of the lens is more than enough to keep the intermediate photographer busy. As I progress into the advanced amateur arena I find that the lens is limiting, hence my desire to go to a more complete modular camera system.
---------------

Flash--The camera includes a built in flash that is surprisingly powerful for its size. In addition, there are many features that separate this camera from "point and shoot" models. Options like first and second-curtain slow synch flash compliment the commonly found red-eye mode. You can learn a lot about photography simply by exploring the different flash effects this camera is capable of. The flash is more than competent for fill flash work (up to about 10') and there is even a flash-intensity  adjustment in the menu!!!! The camera also sports a full TTL-enabled hotshoe and I have to say that the optional Fl-40 accessory flash is as good as anything out there. Unfortunately ,almost no second-party vendors support the TTL features for the Olympus digital cameras. Apparently the digital hotshoe is different from the one found on Olympus OM SLRs. I have to use a Promaster ringflash unit in MANUAL mode because no one makes an Olympus compatible module for it. Promaster does have one standard flash that will work with the digital but the Olympus Fl-40 is a far superior product. Pro features like a flash synch port allow the intermediate photographer to experiment with studio lights and external strobes.
     Flash modes are adjusted by pressing the flash button to the right of the viewfinder and adjusting the "command dial" until the appropriate icon appears on the LED screen. In addition, the viewfinder and LED screen prompt you when the camera feels that flash might be appropriate. This prompt is apparently given to warn those who plan on handholding the camera that shutter speed might be getting dangerously slow for such a trick....not that the exposure will be inadequate. Since I tripod mount for most serious work this is not an issue, but I used this feature all the time to see when I should tripod mount vs. handhold until experience kicked in and I learned the ropes. 
----------------------------

Auto Focus----As with all auto focus cameras, the more light the better. I have little problem with the auto focus on this camera. Half depressing the trigger starts the meter and begins the focusing process. As usual, off-center focusing can be a hassle but there is a focus lock. Unfortunately the focus lock is awkward for tripod use. At the rear right of the camera top is the AEL button that doubles as an auto exposure lock and a focus lock. it can be triggered by the thumb but the position is only comfortable when using the optical finder in a handheld position. Unfortunately you must half depress the trigger, focus on the subject, depress the focus lock with your thumb .....and then recompose the image to put the subject where you want it ...then fully depress the trigger to take the shot. If you release the focus lock at any time the camera will re-meter and refocus. Its not really that hard when using the camera handheld, but this can be a real trick when using a tripod at knee height with a remote trigger release. Remember the reason for the release is so I don&#146t have to touch the camera!    The double duty of the focus lock also as an exposure lock causes trouble when you want to focus one subject but expose for another. This can be dealt with by setting exposure manually, but it does deter a little from the "handheld" experience. My Nikon F4 has a separate exposure lock and focus lock and I prefer that system. 

     The single focusing sensor is located near the trigger and it is possible to obscure the window if you have big hands like I do. I can keep my hands out of the way as a matter of habit now, but early on it was a hassle. The camera wouldn't focus properly and I thought it was the camera.....nope....just my hand in the way of the sensor.....but that is a legitimate ergonomic problem.

     This is not a camera for those who like to manually focus their subjects. When looking through the viewfinder and adjusting focus manually it is easy to think that you have found the correct focus only to come home and upload junk to your computer. The "in focus" range is very wide and it seems that there is almost a full half turn of the dial where the image appears fully focused. Experience shows that actual sweet spot is somewhere near the end of that range, but is hard to be sure. The LCD screen is not large enough to reveal the level of detail needed to show if you achieved tight focus on your subject. Luckily, the autofocus is excellent and I rarely have any situations where I am forced to manually focus.  The lack of a reliable manual focus also causes problems because of the previously mentioned focus lock/exposure lock button. If the manual focus worked well you could manually focus the subject and use the exposure lock just for exposure. The unreliability of the manual focus eliminates this as an option. Like I said, this is rarely an issue, but it is a legitimate concern to anyone who prefers manual focus.

---------------------

White balance-- while I normally leave the WB in auto mode unless I have a strange situation to deal with, White balance can be adjusted manually by depressing the WB button on the front of the camera while focusing on a white object. I find the auto setting is right 99% of the time . You only need to override it when you want to achieve effects in unusual light (like fireworks). It can be set by hand.There is a chart in the manual describing each setting and the intended lighting conditions involved with that setting.

---------------------------
Exposure compensation-- This is a real pet-peeve of mine. To set exposure compensation one must depress the +/- button on the side of the lens base with the left hand, and use the exposure compensation dial with the right thumb. Definitely NOT a blind operation and definitely not a quick process and definitely not something that can be done while keeping an eye on the subject. I admit that the EC dial on my F4 is hardly ideal, but it is at least easy to use tripod-mounted with one hand while I quickly take bracket shots with the other hand on the trigger release. The Olympus system is overly complicated in handheld and tripod modes and the requirement of using 2 hands makes it hard to pay attention to the subject.

Now you can set the camera to bracket 3 consecutive shots automatically (depress trigger and 3 shots are taken) or manually ( you depress the trigger 3 times). The exposure can be set in 1/3, 2/3, or full stops + and minus. Anything other than 3 shots......or any desire to bracket in only one direction must be done manually. Sometimes when I go on scouting trips to look for possible serious subject matter (that I will return to later with my Nikon...) I will set the bracketing on auto in 2/3 stop settings and take shots in program mode or Aperture mode. It does a really great job,especially if you want to be lazy with the metering.

Of course, in Manual Mode you could just bracket by adjusting the appropriate dial. In fact, this is much more practical than using the dedicated exposure compensation buttons. Both shutter speed and aperture move in 1/3 stop increments.....so in Manual mode just adjust shutter speed or aperture (depending on  your needs) in one click increments either way to bracket the shot 1/3 ev whichever direction you want. This is very fast and works every bit as well as a dedicated exposure compensation dial.


----------------------------

Other settings--- Practically every other function on the camera is operated by a menu using the LCD panel on the back. There is a button to the right of the LCD that powers the LCD for use as a viewfinder and another one that puts you into menu mode.  The menus you are presented with vary depending upon which mode the camera is in. The menu you get in A, P, M, or S mode is very different from the menu you get in playback mode. For the most part they make sense. The menus for the program modes have to do with picture taking while the ones in playback and upload mode have to do with their respective functions...

Card setup---allows you to erase a card or even format one

ISO settings--- unusual in that the settings are 80/160/320/auto. This allows you to force a film speed. This is most important in low light shots when you don't want the graininess associated with fast ISO numbers and you are willing to tripod mount and accept a long shutter speed. I find the ISO modes do roughly compare with the standard 100/200/400. Perhaps the 320 mode is more like an 800 in extremely low light, but at dusk or in low room light it acts more like 400 speed.

Bracketing--- allows 3 shots bracketed in 1/3, 2/3, or full stops + and - only.

Flash intensity.... very cool and unusual feature to adjust light intensity. Thus is very useful for fill-flash in  difficult lighting, but the LCD is not big enough to let you know if you got the exact effect you were looking for .....so experience has to be your guide.

Sharpness and contrast   ---both can be adjusted to soft, normal and hard.I leave them at normal. I find the other settings to be too unusual for my tastes.Experiment, you never know until you try it.

resolution mode--- this can be adjusted by depressing the resolution button and moving the "command dial" or by adjusting it in the menu. I find the menu option unnecessarily redundant, but the menu does give you info regarding resolution and compression ratios in case you forget what each resolution does...

playback- allows you to set the camera to show you each shot you take -as you take it...and holds the image for a set period of time... I have mine set to show me each shot for 5 seconds. This gives me a chance to see if I roughly got the shot.

beep tones-- allows you to turn on one of the worst imitation SLR sounds I have ever heard. Anyone who owns an SLR with a motor drive can attest that it doesn&#146t even come close..BUT, there is one saving grace in that there is an audible "in focus" beep that is helpful when you are taking quick snapshots and don't have time to compose and ensure critical focus at the same time.Just compose, wait for the beep (split second)...then shoot. It also allows me to let others use the camera and I know if they focused correctly or not. Apparently not everyone in the world is aware that you have to half depress the trigger to focus, so its nice to know that their poorly composed shot (with the heads chopped off) will at least be in focus :-)...

sleep mode - sets the time the camera will stay turned on  without any input from you. Usually nothing a film SLR user would worry about since the camera turns back on almost instantly....but with this camera it can take 20 seconds to be ready to take the shot!!! So be warned......don't let the camera go to sleep if you are waiting for something to happen with your subject. It takes too long for the camera to wake up to take most candid shots. I leave mine in 10-minute mode.....just in case I leave the camera on accidentally...

other functions allow for setting date, time, file names, resetting the entire camera, pixel mapping and histogram playbacks. It is important that only cameras with newer firmware have the ability to pixel map....that is, they can detect bad pixels and compensate for them. You definitely want to do this since it is very annoying to have a few pixels showing bright white in your otherwise perfect shot....

--------------------------------------

Use-

now here is the nitty gritty. We have gone thru all the features and some basics of how they work.....but how does the camera system work as a whole? Here are some different aspects of using the Olympus E10 and how they work in the real world

Point and shoot- as a point and shoot camera you set everything at default setting and use program mode. This thing is the king of the snapshot! Most hi-tech SLRs suffer from being too manual to be able to function as point and shoots.....after all, why would you want to? Well, when I scout places to shoot the next day I often use A or P mode and just point and shoot. When I am just taking snapshots of the kids I use P mode unless I need depth of field....so I use it all the time. Even though I have literally thousands of serious tripod mounted/trigger release/manual mode shots taken with this camera, I have taken just as many point and shoot shots and the results are amazing....crisp focus, great exposure. Let's face it, this is where matrix metering rules! Close up snapshots of people resolve with good colors and overall decent prints...    for snapshots. 

Serious work- (handheld) The exposure compensation is awkward and I often am forced into manual mode when Aperture mode would normally be fine. ....simply because I can just adjust shutter speed with the command dial using one hand rather than using the complicated 2 hand system for the exposure compensation system. Also, the exposure lock and focus lock being one and the same sometimes causes creative problems and I have to once again switch to manual mode to cover the exposure and use the AEL button just as a focus lock. But besides those two things that are not HUGE problems.It works great and I have had some shots that I couldn't believe I took handheld. The only limit is resolution, you always want more mega pixels. Since handheld work requires faster shutter speeds the aperture cap of F/11 doesn't really come into play.....but the 1/640th second shutter speed is too slow for some subjects and this is where you need the speed (handheld with the freedom of movement to track to subject! The size and weight of the camera gives a feeling of stability and confidence. I feel like I am more in control when I can feel the camera.....feel its heft and weight. Then again, I am 6' 2" with big hands and I admit a 5' person might find the camera too large, especially with the portrait grip.

serious work (tripod mounted)- The aperture cap of F/11 comes into play almost every time I use this camera anymore... Neutral density filters are an almost standard accessory, but the weight of the camera makes for a more stable platform in wind. This helps with reducing camera shake. The lack of a depth of field preview is sometimes an issue, but to be fair, with a cap of F/11 there isn't much more I can do but leave it at max aperture and deal with the result. The lack of a bulb mode over 30 seconds is unforgivable in my opinion. Night photography is not really an option. Even if it went to 15 minutes it might be hugely improved. I am sure the batteries would never hold out long enough to do star trails, but I have had several times I had to break out a film camera so I could take a 10 or 15 minute exposure.

------------------------------------------

Accessories-- once you get into more serious photography you have to be concerned with the accessories you can get for your camera to expand your photographic potential. There is good reason most people gravitate toward Nikon or Canon for serious digital work and it has everything to do with the available "systems".... Olympus has very little in the way of accessories and the ones that do exist are often lacking. I own many of them and this is a basic list of how they work...

Wide angle lens attachment----WCON 08B- for the size of a fisheye and the price of a nice zoom lens you get the luxury of an amazing 28mm wide angle F2 lens (just kidding!!)     I have used it maybe twice. The minute wide-angle improvement makes a difference vs. the basic 35mm lens on the camera....not worth the cash...and it uses 105mm filter to boot!!!

Telephoto Lens attachment--- TCON 14B    sort of like the wide-angle fiasco only in reverse. The extra 60mm of fixed focal length lens does little for your photography but sure will build up arm strength.You almost need a tripod to deal with the weight. I have seen 500mm mirror lenses take up less space. I have used it 2 or 3 times....

Telephoto Lens Attachment  TCON 300--  almost as long as your arm and requiring a lens collar for your tripod.You only get 300mm of fixed focal length but your wallet will be $600 lighter... I was so disappointed with the TCON 14B I never bothered even looking for a deal on a TCON 300

Macro Lens attachment--- MCON 35.... now I like this one  a lot and I use it all the time. It has a claimed minimum focus distance of 4" and I suppose this is possible. I see it more like 6"....   anyhoo... the glass is sharp, you can get it for about $100 and it works very well...

30 watt LiPo battery set/portrait grip- an absolute must-have. Increases the size and heft of the camera to the levels of an F series Nikon but extends the battery life into the 100+ shot range with liberal LCD use. The extra portrait shutter release is an added plus since I use vertical shots more than horizontal. It costs $250-$300 but it is worth every penny. Includes a wrist strap that practically makes the camera meld with your hand... I love it and never take it off.

Remote trigger release... well its a $60 piece of wire with a switch but it works well and does what it should...another must-have..

Hotshoe flash Fl-40--   a great flash unit that can hold its own against the better offerings from other makers... a must have for the serious indoor photographer....but expensive $300+. It is difficult, but not impossible, to use a Stroboframe to get the flash off the hotshoe. The hotshoe cable is apparantly availabe from a third party vendor. I had to make mine.

Conclusions-

What I like about the E-10--   

-- has all the features of a camera twice the price but still can be used as a point and shoot.....so you can build confidence and still experiment.
----superior construction that can handle the elements as well as any top brand camera. Metal is hard to find these days and the E10 is made with lots of it
-----100% LCD screen. If the optical viewer can't be 100% at least I still have 100% thru the LCD and this makes it possible to focus in the viewer and compose in the LCD and also check for camera tilt.
----Great lens combo. If the lens has to be permanently attached to the camera they did pick a good one and it is useful for most of the types of photography I do.
-----auto bracketing... although limited to 3 shots it normally is more than adequate and I find it quite useful
---- excellent resolution. It might not be 20Megapixels but I can produce stunning 8x10s and pretty good 11x14s depending on the subject. Of course I get them printed proffesionaly after post processing at home if needed.
------TV playback. I have actually used this feature more than once to give quick slideshows on TVs.... it's gimmicky to be sure, but I like having it.
-----ability to use compact flash or Smart media
----- a great camera to learn on... while not all the features are as easy to use as other system's.....I learned a hell of a lot about photography by experimenting with the pro level features on this camera and I feel it made me prepared to fully utilize the features on the best digital and film SLR backs on the market today
--- I wouldnt be half the photographer I am today without this camera. I have spent whole days experimenting with techniques in the studio...for no cost other than my time. I have shot literally 100 frames on the same subject to experiment with lighting. This is not something I would have done with a film camera because of cost issues. A digital will change your photography forever...it is not a replacement for film, but an amazing compliment to it.


what I don't like about the E-10

---  slow write times and massive file sizes in Tiff mode. I noticed that other cameras with much larger ccds generate Tiffs of smaller or similar size. Also, the write times are so slow in Tiff mode that I rarely use the mode anymore. It takes upwards of 45 seconds to write one shot and the buffer can only handle 3 shots in Tiff mode. I use raw mode or Jpeg 2:1.... but I wish I could shoot Tiffs
-- shutter speed cap of 2 seconds in A, P, S mode..... 8 sec in manual and 30 second in bulb....  very much limits my photography now that I have advanced enough to know what I like to shoot.
---- Aperture cap of F/11....   not good... not good at all. At least give me F/16 if not F/22. This is the most limiting feature I think.. Of course, without slower shutter speeds it would be useless anyway..
-----poor accessory system... You just can't compare with the options that Nikon and Canon can offer. It kind of makes this a dead-end camera. When I went looking for a new digital, Olympus never came to mind....not because of my feelings about the E10 (I love the E10!), but because the E10/20 are as good as it gets in the Olympus system . Unfortunately these would only be upper mid-level cameras in the Nikon or Canon lineup. Olympus doesn't offer their customers any room to grow upwards.
------4 mega pixels... 2 years ago this was an amazing bargain for a camera in this ccd range, but as usual, technology is making this camera slowly obsolete. You always want more but I think it can be safely stated that the E10 is not the equivalent of 35mm slide film...so until digital definitively reaches this boundary you will always want more mega pixels. It is still a great camera for the money, but it may no longer be the best bang for the buck.. .....and quality digital SLR backs from Nikon and Canon are available in the used market for somewhat similar prices....these at least offer lens interchangeability and access to a complete system of accessories.

---------------------

Conclusion...first off I want to thank anyone who actually read this far. I know this reads like a (confusing) book....but I felt I could not fully review this camera and offer an interesting perspective unless I told the whole story. The bottom line is this.. If you can get it for cheap enough, this camera will allow you to progress to the point that you are fully ready and qualified to use a pro level digital SLR back from other manufacturers. It is unfortunate that the makers of this fine product have elevated this camera to the highest level of their lineup....because, while it may be good, you definitely can outgrow it and Olympus doesn't offer anything digital (or film for that matter) that will allow you to grow further as a photographer. I am not suggesting that equipment alone makes the photographer.....but I am fairly certain that the lack of versatility imposed by the poor accessory support will certainly limit your ability to pursue certain avenues of photography. I love my E10 and I don't regret having bought it for one moment, but I don't know that I would have bought it again in 2003 when other options are available..

ergonomics it gets 3 stars without the portrait grip and 5 stars with.

ease of use it gets 4 stars....it could be better but it could also be A LOT worse.

camera system..... 3 stars. Some accessories are offered, but the massive lineups offered by Canon and Nikon make the Olympus line pale in comparison. Also, third party accessory support is weak.

Longevity...3 stars. You could certainly keep taking pictures until it died, but then again you could still be using a meter less manual camera. Technology moves very fast and the Olympus E10 will soon be out of date.

I guess this gives it 3 stars overall. It would have been 4 or even 5 stars in 2000, but 3 years make all the difference and the E10 is showing its age. Also&#133my opinions of the camera have changed now that I feel I have outgrown it. Someone who wants to learn more about photography would have a much different view.
