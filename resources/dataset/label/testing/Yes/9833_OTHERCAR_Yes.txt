            I once vowed to my wife that I would never purchase a Korean made vehicle whatsoever.  I'm half Korean (mother is Korean) and have lived in Japan and Korea for over half of my life (I am fast approaching 40).  Two years ago, I purchased a Nissan Frontier truck to drive around town and to and from work.  Well, the truck has been great; however, too small to transport more than one passenger.  I decided to purchase a small four door vehicle and looked at a lot of cars.  I narrowed my choice to the Nissan Sentra and Mazda Protege.  While looking around a local dealer's lot (Hyundai, Jeep, Daewoo, Kia), I noticed the Daewoo Nibura and immediately liked the exterior look.  Still, I thought the car would be garbage since it was Korean made even though I know Daewoo has been around for sometime having lived in Korea.  But, after a test drive, I was impressed.  The car handled smoothly, was roomy and the interior did not look &quot;cheap&quot; like I thought it would.  No, it's not the &quot;perfect&quot; car then again, I don't really think there's one out there.  But, in terms of price, standard equipment and performance, the Nubira is an excellent value.  My wife and daughter immediately fell in love with the car and lo and behold, I purchased one ($13,474:  fully loaded with the exception of cruise control and a CD player).  After I made the purchase, I continued to doubt my decision; however, the more I drive the vehicle, the more I love it.  It is fun to drive, elegant in appearance and after the initial break in period (500 miles), my city EPA has improved from 18mpg to 21-22mpg (not bad at all considering the vehicle is an automatic and the air conditioner has been on constantly).  If this car proves to be reliable, DAEWOO has found it's mark with the Nubira.  It is a very smooth riding vehicle and the stereo is definitely top of the line.  Although I love Japanese made cars, I did not want to pay the price.  So, I took a chance on a company that has been around for awhile and I haven't been disappointed thus far.  Don't believe me......go to the web and read the reviews (LYCOS search engine and type in DAEWOO NUBIRA).  Additionally, test drive one for yourself and YOU make the determination.  The overall value of the vehicle can't be beat.  Who knows, you might (and I think you will) be pleasantly surprised and impressed.  Also, don't think of this car as an &quot;alternative&quot; to the Honda's, Toyota's or other major car companies but a &quot;competitor&quot; who has made a definite impact.  Daewoo isn't knocking on the doors of the competition......they've already opened them and are in the same room.  <br><br>
