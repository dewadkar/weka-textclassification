            I am a proud owner of a 1999 Jepp Wrangler TJ.  Hands down the best 4X4 truck in its class.  Less than 2 years after purchase and 40, 000 miles on the odometer it is still going strong.  On the road, its very comfortable.  Plows through headwinds, with the 4.0l inline 6.  Can handle 33x12.50's with no gearing.  Handles well.  Some wind noise witht the hard top....easily drowned out by the 4 speaker stereo/cassette.  Off road, it shines.  The jeep Wrangler TJ climbs like a goat.  Stock my jeep performed with highly modified trucks of the same class, with little or no difficulties.   One word describes it.....UNSTOPPABLE.  Sucessful offroad even with the most unskilled driver, it could do it itself.  A trusted companion, and a true friend.....Jeep Wrangler.<br><br>
