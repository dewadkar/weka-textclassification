            The Jaguar XJ6 is an excellent automobile for those with an appreciation for the finer things in life.  

The days of electronics nightmares and poor quality are long over.  Ford Motor Company's revitalized line of Jaguars offer some of the most impressive interiors available today.  Combine that with superb power and great drivability and you've got the makings of a thoroughbred.  

The Jags a heavier than your average Lexus or Acura, not only in shear weight but in style as well.  No Japanese-Euro-wanna-be's here.  These cars exude confidence and sophistication.  This car makes you feel like smoking a pipe and wearing a tweed jacket and driving cap.

The smell of the leather, the reflection on the bright wood work, the shimmer of the sun on the unique curves all merge to create one of the finest mass production automobiles available on the road today.  

When comes to driving, the XJ6 offers a very stately sure ride, not too soft, not too unforgiving.  It holds its line comfortably yet has the power to get you from the on ramp to the front of the pack without worry.  Very quiet, it nevertheless offers the driver a good sense of feel behind the wheel.  Braking is good, not too soft not too abrupt.

The boot (trunk) offers excellent storage capacity and the rear passengers will comfortably ride in style.  Automatic temperature control, a fantastic multi-speaker sound system and ample interior lighting in addition to the well appointed interior (rear tray tables available should you so desire) make the XJ6 a one of a kind.

In Summary, the Jaguar XJ6 by Ford Motor Company is one of the most reliable and substantive automobiles available on the market today.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates the finer things in life.<br><br>
