            This camera has a lot to offer for amateur or semi-pro photographer looking for high resolution digital photos. I purchased this product to be able to take many pictures of my preschool kids without paying for the one hour drug-store photo service visits. I wanted a camera that has flash and zoom lens with auto-focus built in, yet it has many auto/manual features that my old 35mm camera had if I wanted to be very creative. With my 35mm SLR I would get maybe one good picture of my kids out of a 24pictures roll of 35mm film plus I had to carry those different lenses around. Yes, I was wasting film, time and money and not getting great pictures! This lesson moved me to the digital from the 35mm film medium. I spend two years doing research on all brands/models before selecting this camera. Given the fantastic integrated auto-focus zoom lens on it I am able to get great shots of any subject in motion including my kids. There are three draw backs I found  as follows: 1)when taking pictures at the highest resolution the camera buffer is not large enough for continues shooting. This means that after 4 successive shots one has to wait until the camera moves all the images from the buffer to the storage media card. 2) This maybe a  problem  if you want to take a lot of photos at the highest resolution so it is desirable to purchase the largest compact flash card available that has a fastest access time and can off load the buffer quickly.3) The battery life is average at best when the LCD color screen is used just little. If you decide to use the LCD screen to compose every shot or the built-in flash unit be prepared to purchase few spare lithium battery pack. Unlike other cameras that use proprietary (custom) battery packs that are very expensive this camera can operate on 4-AA standard cells that can be purchased just about anywhere when traveling so that is a big plus! In addition this camera has a rich set of features for full manual control and creative close-ups photography that are easy to use and well explained in probably the best (100 page)owners manual that I have seen from a Japan manufacturer.
