            Recently, I got my new 2000 Maxima SE, fully loaded.

<b>Pros:</b>

The <i>BOSE Sound System</i> is absolutely amazing.  I really enjoy music to a greater extent with this car.  (The neighbors don't really appreciate hearing my car whenever I'm nearby.)

The <i>Leather Seats</i> are more comfortable than the leather seats in my previous car (95 Acura Integra GSR).  I also tested the comfort of the leather seats against a few other cars, and am very happy with what I have.

The <i>Zero-To-Sixty</i> is only 6.7 seconds officially.  How many full size cars do you know that do that while under $35,000 fully loaded??

The <i>Amazing Cornering Power</i>.  I have found this car absolutely fun to drive because it corners better than any car I have ever driven.  The car sticks to the road like you'd never believe!

The <i>Trunk Room</i> is much larger than I expected, and is very useful when traveling for a large vacation (or with many people).

The <i>Extra Large Room</i> in the car is amazing.  My 6'3&quot; brother enjoys the fact that he actually fits in the car without opening the sun roof.

And now...<b>The Con:</b>

The fully loaded 2000 Maxima SE cost around $32,000.  I should have left out a few options (such as <i>Leather Seats</i> and <i>Heated Seats</i>, etc.) and I could have gotten the 2000 Maxima for $10,000 less!  The base price on the lower model (the GXE) is around $22,000.

So, if you can afford this car, fully loaded or not, go enjoy!
