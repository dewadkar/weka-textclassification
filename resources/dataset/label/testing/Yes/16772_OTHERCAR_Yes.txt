            This camera was my first foray into the digital photography realm. Because I am a newbie, the abundance of manual settings and features on this camera was a tad overwhelming at first, but overall a plus, because of its potential. That said, I should warn people that it seems this model has discontinued by Olympus, and replaced by newer 5.0-megapixel models with more powerful zoom capability. I got this camera at an unbelievable close-out price at Target, but since then they have sold out. So, if you can find this camera, and you want a substantially powerful package that takes clear, beautiful photos that you can print up to 8x10 in vivid detail (the specs say 11x14, but I am not somebody who makes a lot of prints of this size), then by all means, snap this baby up.

The drawbacks? The memory card (SmartMedia -- word has it, on its way out as a memory medium) that comes packaged with the camera is ridiculously small, capacity-wise. Go invest in a couple of 128-MB cards, and don't worry about getting the Olympus brand. Less expensive brands work just fine. The only feature I know of that you must have an Olympus card for is the panorama feature (stitch together multiple photos), and you can always use your little pre-included Olympus card for that. The batteries, as with most digital cameras and other high-drain electronics, run down rather quickly, so you'll need to replace them with a good set of rechargeables. Also, the grip on this camera is plastic, which is fine if you're not into glossy appearances, but it does tend to feel a bit cheap as you see "slicker" models with all-metal bodies out there. If you want a pocket-sized Olympus camera, try one of the newer compact models with the sliding lens cover. If you're a zoom lover, this camera's zoom is probably average or just below average, compared to some of the newer models out there. And lastly, the lens caps tends to pop off fairly easily.

Don't get me wrong. I really like this camera. It has produced wonderfully rich prints for me, and I enjoy the potential this packs. I have thus far defaulted to the automatic settings that came preset, for sheer convenience, but my friend, who is more of a digital camera geek, played around with it and was impressed by its versatility. You can also take short videos (without sound), but beware the lighting -- the few I took in normal indoor settings came out quite dark. The LCD display on the back is a nice size and quite clear in the light, but like all digitals, it lacks a clear image in darker lighting. The zoom is average for digitals, but it's "good enough" for most amateur photography purposes.

Don't worry so much about getting the "perfect camera," because as far as I can tell, it doesn't exist. I am happy and satisfied with this camera, and I stand by the choice I made, after a long period of researching multiple brands and models. The Camedia C-4000 Zoom is a great value for its price.
