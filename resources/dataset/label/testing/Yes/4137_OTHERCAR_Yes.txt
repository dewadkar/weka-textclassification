            I purchased my Legend used, in 1997, after it came off a two-year lease. I am happier with this car than with any other I have owned.

Other than routine maintenance and tune-ups, the only problem I have had with the vehicle is a dead battery. It is now six years old and continues to run like a top. Its six-cylinder engine has great pick-up and virtually no noise with the windows rolled up. Mileage is decent--about 22 mpg city and 26 mpg highway. It handles well under most conditions, although the vehicle does not handle as well as others I have owned when going uphill under snowy conditions. Also, it is a tad mushy in turns at higher speeds, but I've never lost traction, even in rain.

The interior shows almost no signs of wear. The seats remain firm and comfortable, and the dash and console look almost new, with no cracks or other evidence of deterioration. The air conditioning and heater continue to perform well and all of the many electronic components (windows, sun roof, stereo, seat adjustment controls, dashboard functions) have all been trouble free. The interior is also quite roomy and carries five adults comfortably.

One warning--if you purchase one of these used, insist on having the dealership give you the serial number to the radio. Any break in the electrical system requires you to enter a security code for the radio to continue to work. The dealership wanted to charge me $100 to pull the radio out to get at the serial number. I ended up buying a new stereo instead.

I've put about 60,000 miles on the car, which had about 10,000 when I purchased. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wishing to purchase it.
