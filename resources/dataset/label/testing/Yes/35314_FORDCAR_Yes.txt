            We needed to haul a bunch of stuff from Orlando to New Orleans so we rented a Windstar from Hertz.  It did the job with aplomb.  We drove it 1500 miles running mostly around 80 and got 16 MPG.  Everything worked fine for the duration of the trip.  Performance was good, it stops and handles almost as well as my old Taurus.  The power seat and adjustable pedal feature is a real plus for my wife who is 4 foot 9 inches.  It enabled her to find a good driving position.  More cars should have this adjustable pedal feature.  Shorter people are really handicapped.  They must push the seat forward to reach the pedals and this usually places them too close to the steering wheel and the air bag.  A vehicle with a steering wheel that pulls in and out would be even more helpful.  Tilt wheels are not very helpful.

I have no comment on reliability since we did not have the vehicle for very long.  While we had it, all it needed was gasolene and an occassional windshield cleaning.  Bugs are plentiful in the Florida panhandle.
