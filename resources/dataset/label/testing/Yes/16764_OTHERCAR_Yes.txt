            Four primary factors pushed me to buy the Olympus C-4000.

1. I already own an Olympus D460 Zoom and have been very happy with it.  The Camedia software is the best I have found for fixing pictures that are under-exposed or off color, and that is saying a lot.  I have used many of the main image software including Microsoft and Adobe and the Camedia is still the best in my opinion.

2. Cost - when compared to the Canon G2, which in my opinion is the only other camera close in the 4.0 MP league, there was a $200 to $250 price difference.  The on-camera ease-of-use features are slightly less on the Olympus C-4000, meaning you need to go into more menus and adjust things manually instead of turning a dial or pushing a button, but overall the camera will do all the same things that the G2 can.

3. Batteries - The largest cost savings advantage is the savings you get in batteries.  The G2, and many other cameras like it, require special batteries.  The C-4000 will run on 4-AA batteries.  Of course standard alkaline will run out quickly, but using NiMH rechargable batteries works EXCELLENT.  They last a very long time and you can use them over and over again.  The camera comes with 2-CVR3 batteries, but don't let that scare you, the literature clearly states you can use standard AA batteries.

4. Maximum PC Magazine put the Olympus C-4000 head-to-head with the Canon G2 and several others and the C-4000 came out on top.  Their review is worth reading.  Their motto is (and it is on the cover of each magazine) "Maximum PC, Minimum BS" and they certainly live up to that claim in my experience so far.
