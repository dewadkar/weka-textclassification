            So you ask why that title? I can't believe that GM is thinking about stopping production of this car. You will not find a sports car that can do what the new camaro can do for the price! Bottom line, that new LS-1 engine is just awsome. The power is just out of this world. Even though most folks do mod up the engine to get a few more hp, you have so much to start out with. The ride is better than I found in any mustang or other sports car. If you want to learn more about this fine auto you can check out the f-body sights at http://www.f-body.org It's one of the few cars that you can take off of the show room floor and see some good numbers at the track without doing anything to that awsome engine!
Keep in mind, GM was thinking about dropping this line so you better get yours while they still make em..  Remember, you will not find a car perform as good as the Chevy Camaro for the price that is offered!
