            I lost my Minolta SLR camera and the zoom lens to vandals in Orlando, FL and needed to buy a camera.  I was looking for the orginal camera papers to file a claim during which I noticed a ton of devloped photos taken over a period of ten years cluttering my study (by the way I have only one album).  So it dawned on me that may be my next camera should be a digital camera, so that I do not have to print the pictures and yet save the moment for memory.  I did a lot of research and ended up with a Olympus D-450 Zoom.

Here are the highlights:
Not too expensive - paid only $399 through Onsale - atcost.
Clear pictures especially when taken outdoors.
Easy to carry - small compact like a regular auto focus.
Sleek.
Easy to operate.
Has 3 times optical zoom and two times digital zoom - equivalent to something like a 35mm to 110 zoom SLR camera.
Has capability to take rapid shots.
Lots more features than I have time to explore such panoromic shots etc.
Came with Adobe Photo Deluxe to manipulate pictures, a great and easy to use software.
Thumbs down items:
Use flash indoors otherwise picture not that great - flash light doesn't pop up by itself.
Careful when handling flash light - looks a little bit flimsy - I haven't broken mine yet.
