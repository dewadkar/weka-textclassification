            The A4 is in a head to head tie with the BMW 3 series. Both drive great and offer many features. I would probably tend to pick the BMW over the Audi, but to me, Audi comes in far ahead of the Infinity G20, the Acura CL, and every other car in its class. 

I have not driven a car that has such responsive steering as the Audi. Tracking is almost unnecessary when driving it. It's handling is superb, and while performance not quite that of the BMW, it's still excellent. 

The interior is simply amazing. You can choose themes of color inside, that truly make your car unique. Audi has always had the largest choice of colors, and they do it again with the choice of interior style. 

The car is perfect for the younger generation and it's certainly a statement of style. No one can really go wrong with the A4.<br><br>
