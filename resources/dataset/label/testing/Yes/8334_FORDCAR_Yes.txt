            Not everyone wants an Econobox but if you do, here is a good one. I am writing a review on my brothers 1993 ford probe SE.  His is the basic model, just power steering, no AC, PW/PDl or anything.  It has the DOHC 2 liter 115 hp 118-Ft LB engine.  As far as the engine goes, it has never completely quit on the road but it has come close.  The some problems were simple, spark plug wires, next cap and rotor (basic tune up but who knows why ford designed a $80 cap and rotor, not joking).  Other more expensive repairs are a $350 fuel injector cleaning.  My brother does all his mechanic work himself, accept that because the stupid injectors have to be cleaned by a pro so he had to take it in.  Currently the car has 140,000 miles (almost out of life) and we ran a compression test on it.  #1,2,3 all have 180 PSI and #4 has 90 PSI.  You probably know that that is not a good thing.  My brother is a mechanical genus and him and I concluded that it was a bad exhaust valve so he was going to take the head off and fix it (a 6 hour job for a pro because of ford being an idiot and putting the intake plenum in the back as well as the DOHC having a timing belt).  He went to the auto parts store and they told him that just for the head gasket would be $105 dollars.  Needless to say, after that he decided to just leave it and sell it.  Any way enough on the engine, the car rides very well and handles like a Camaro or mustang, it really holds the road, the steering is precise and the car goes where you point it.  Even with low compression you can still get rubber out of 2 gears when it is wet and it can get to 60 in just a little bit over 10 seconds.  For a 4 cylinder, it has some good snap to it (unless you are under 3000 rpm).  Than it is a dog.  All around it is not a bad car; not to many parts needed accept the injectors cleaned and a few maintenance parts.  I would buy one if I did not have a Camaro (a superior car).  Really with any vehicle that old you can expect some minor problems but you get what you pay for.  Thanks for reading
