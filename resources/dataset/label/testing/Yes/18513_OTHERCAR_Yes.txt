            My parents bought me my Jeep Cherokee Laredo this winter because they were worried about me driving my Geo storm on sleet and ice, and just basically wanted something reliable.  My father picked out a blue one with 4WD, and it has been absolutely wonderful for driving in snow and ice.  Not too long after I got my Jeep, we had a huge snowstorm and I was easily able to drive around while most people were stuck in doors.  Another huge plus has been the roominess of the Jeep.  In my previous car, I could usually have only one passenger, because if anyone sat in the back seat, they were left with a very stiff neck from bending in an awkward position.  Now, I have plenty of room for friends, family (I have 2 very young nephews and getting them out of their car seats is a breeze) and even a recliner to ride comfortably.  

The biggest downside for me has been the enormous gas tank.  With gas prices steadily on the rise, it's taking more and more of my paycheck to keep my Jeep on the road.   

This is a great family vehicle because of the ease of getting children in and out and it's large capacity.  Also good for teenagers and college students who need to get around, but want to do it safely.  Not for anyone who has a need for speed! <br><br>
