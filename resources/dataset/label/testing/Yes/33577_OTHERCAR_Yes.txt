            Unfortunately, we were recently involved in an auto accident. The lucky part is that we were in a 540. After having gone through what we did, I can't say enough positives about this car. 

As far as the accident went, we were rear ended on one side, very hard, very sudden, and subsequently got rammed underneath the SUV in front of us. The car absorbed the very strong impact, and the crumple zones did exactly what they were supposed to do. The rear and front of the car were pretty heavily damaged in the severity of the accident. However, the important part, the main cabin, stayed perfectly in tact. We were lucky enough to walk away completely unharmed. 

A lot of epinions have covered the handling and performance of these cars, which by the way, is exceptional... but given the recent events, I felt it was worth it to post how safe these cars really are in a serious accident. 

The cost of the car is fairly high, but the value of walking away from the accident is higher. <br><br>
