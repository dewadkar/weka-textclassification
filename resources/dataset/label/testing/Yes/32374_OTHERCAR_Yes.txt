            The Lincoln Navigator was one my favorite showoff examples of the various jewels I get to drive! I transport different vehicles for different reasons for different jobs while I am out on the road doing my other thing.  Is that evasive enough?  I wish I owned this baby!  The owner of the company is the lucky guy driving this one full time.  I just had to get it from one place to the other.  
This classy ride showed awesome luxury! The Lincoln Navigator is great for it's handling and all out performance. This is one of the more impressive SUV's that I have seen. The Navigator offers lots, and I mean a whole lot of space and comfort. Taking a seat behind the wheel of this beauty will put you in in total awe over this ride! The Navigator is just loaded full of new technology with features that you will want to discover and then play with.  This Lincoln is definitely worthy of a closer look if you are looking. I really think that anyone will like what they see here!  Light that one up and pass it over here!<br><br>
