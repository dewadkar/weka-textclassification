            This is the best all around SUV! Not to big to take into downtown traffic and not to small that you feel cramped in a Tokyo train.We bought our 1999 4x4 Durango with the 3rd seat and have plenty of room for us and 3 kids, 2 being over 6' tall! We took a 2500mi.trip to Florida right away with no quality issues.Do be prepared to visit the gas station quite a bit though,this rugged machine gets real thirsty,real quick!The only other fault I've found is we get a lot of wind noise,but the CD player drowns it out nicely.We have 3 other cars but wife and I flip a coin to to see who gets to drive this eye catching vehicle. <br><br>
