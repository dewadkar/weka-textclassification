            My wife is a Honda loyalist.  My Volkswagon finally died after 140,000 miles.  We needed a new car.  She got a 2001 Honda CR-V.  I got her 1992 Civic.

With a new child, we wanted a SUV type vehicle.  We did not want a monster sized one.  Hey, the CR-V seemed perfect.

Likeable features:
1.  size-  not too big, yet roomy enough for 3 adults and a child safety seat.
2. stereo system - nice cd player.  You can preset 12 FM stations and 6 AM stations.  Fade and balance buttons are a good feature. Also, a security code must be entered if it looses power or connection from a battery.  This renders it virtually useless to radio thieves.
3. picnic table - found in the back, tucked out of sight.  Can be pulled out and used.  Sadly, it doesn't come with a hammock.
4. power window and doors - yes, we are a lazy generation.
5. back opening- two step process.  You can open the window (which as a wiper), then the door.  A nice safety feature is that it has to be opened from inside the vehicle, or with a key.  There is no way for it to be closed and openable.  This is another step toward theft prevention.
6. back seats - They fold down and flip.  Obviously, this gives you much more room in the back when hauling things.  Plus, you can only flip one seat if you only need one seat flipped.  This is useful with a childseat in the other seat.  Sadly, many long lost family members and friends may call you to help them carry things.
7. cup holders- folds out of the way in the front seat.  Found on both doors in back seat.  
8. map lights - two separate ones up front.  one for driver and one for passenger.

As you can see, it has many nice features.  By buying it at the end of the year, we were able to get a 2001 just before the 2002's came onto the market.
