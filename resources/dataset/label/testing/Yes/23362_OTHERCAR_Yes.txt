            Are you ready to drive the &quot;fastest sport utility in the world&quot;? Are you the kind of person who likes to do the unexpected? Do you lead an active lifestyle? Think you're the experimentally minded type? Are you male, in the 40-to-45-year age range? Do you have a lot of money to spend on your ride? 
    Well, look what Mercedes has cooked up just for you. 
    Mercedes is moving into the age of the high-performance sport utility vehicle. Designed for those who can afford its $64,900 ticket, the Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG is billed as the &quot;fastest, best-handling SUV&quot; on the market. The highly upgraded version of the ML430, the ML55 AMG boasts &quot;awesome power.&quot; For those who are not familiar with AMG, it is the high-performance arm of Mercedes and is widely known for its tweaking of Mercedes passenger cars. 
    Among the standout equipment and performance changes in the ML55 is a 5.5-liter 342-hp V8 driving a five-speed automatic transmission to claim a 0-to-60-mph time of 6.9 seconds and a 150-mph top speed. The ML55 AMG sits on 18-in. cast alloy wheels covering larger-than-standard brakes fitted with bright red calipers, just like a Porsche. Inside there are side-impact airbags in the rear doors, as well as the front ones. 
    In addition, AMG made a number of subtle styling changes that will set the vehicle apart for discerning drivers. On the hood is a &quot;powerdome&quot; to cover the oversize V8. Bumpers have unique shapes, while the AMG wheels dress up the side view. Inside, a driver sees white background gauges and feels top-quality wood and leather on the steering wheel and shift lever. 
    Mercedes plans to sell a modest 1500 of this Alabama-built model each year against formidable names like Range Rover, Lexus and BMW. <br><br>
