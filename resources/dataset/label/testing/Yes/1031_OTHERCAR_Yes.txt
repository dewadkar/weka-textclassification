            Our 1998 Intrepid ES was purchased new in August of 1998, so we were able to get it fully equipped, (better a/c, better stereo, trip computer, etc) for $21000.  We added the 6 year, 70000 mile Chrysler warranty for about $650. The car just turned 30,000 miles, so other than regular oil changes, at 2500 mile intervals, the only real cost was a 30000 mile check up, where they pull the sludge out of the engine.  This, by the way, improved the performance of the car noticeably; sort of brought it back to that new feel.  The tires that came on the car (Goodyear Eagles) are alright for the time being, but I would love to get Michelin MXV4 Energy tires put on when these wear out.  Ya know what, the Goodyears still have a very significant amount of tread on them.  Damn :)

Anyway, I really love the way this car looks and drives, and have been VERY pleasantly surprised with the lack of any real headaches with the car or the service department at my Dodge Dealership.
