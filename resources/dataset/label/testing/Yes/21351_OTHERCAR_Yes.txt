            Our 1999 Camry has been a pleasure to own and drive. We got the service plan with the car and recommend this highly. Gas milage is great.Regarding dealer service - they went above and beyond. I had my kids with me, ages 3, 5 and 13 at the time, and the salesman made sure that they were entertained throughout the process. There was little pressure in the sales process- it was mostly giving information and getting my input.The financing was handled in a similarly professional manner. They followed through on all their claims.<br><br>
