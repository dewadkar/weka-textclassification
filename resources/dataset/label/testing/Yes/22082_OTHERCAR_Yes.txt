            Not too long ago, I attended my husband's high school reunion.  A friend of ours was there and had his digital camera in tow.  The next morning in our e-mail, we had pictures for the reunion.  That's when we knew we needed a digital camera!

We purchased our camera from Dell.  In a few days, the camera was at our front door waiting to be used.  I was so excited, I was snapping photos left and right.  I am still amazed by technology today!

The nice thing about this particular camera is that it's lightweight, small, and easy to use.  It took me awhile to figure out all the features, and I'm still learning, but I love this camera!

The camera had a great window on the back for instant viewing of pictures.  It also has these cool little built in features like date stamping, and instant deletion options of pictures.

I primarily use this camera for eBay purposes.  It's great, and fast too!
It sure beats taking a picture and waiting days for the film to get developed.  And I can store all the pictures I want on my computer, freeing up the spaces on my Picture card.  I do recommend getting a large picture card.  The one we currently have is only 8MB, and that only allows us approximately 12 photos.  This isn't something I'd take away on a vacation.

There are also a few things I don't like about this camera.  The batteries get drained pretty fast.  I always carry around spare ones now, so I don't go somewhere expecting to use my camera, only to discover I'm out of battery power.

Call me old fashioned, but I still prefer actual print photos any day.  Nothing compares to seeing an album full of photos.  

But, this camera is convenient.  It's nice to take instant photos and e-mail them away to family within minutes.

I wouldn't say that digital cameras are for everybody.  Some people might not find a practical use for them at all.  And some people still prefer the old fashioned method of taking pictures.

But, if you think you might use a digital camera every so often, this is a great buy for your money.<br><br>
