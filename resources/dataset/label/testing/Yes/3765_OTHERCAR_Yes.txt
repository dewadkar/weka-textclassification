            A couple of months ago I decided to get a Truck.  I did not just want a truck that hauled things, but that could transport many people as well.  Well I have found one.  This is the best vehicle that I have ever bought.  It has a v6, CD player, Auto head lamps(comes on automatically), a bed liner, and I could have gotten an electric sun roof.  But I decided not to since I was going to be on the road a lot.  If handles great of army tank trails in the 4 wheel drive.  I have not gotten stuck yet.  Another great feature is that you do not have to lock the wheels down when you put it into 4 wheel drive.  I also get great gas mileage for a 35 gallon gas tank.  I went 200 miles and only used 1/4 tank of gas. I give this truck 4 ï¿½ stars out of five.<br><br>
