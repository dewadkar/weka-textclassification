            (I've revised this opinion slightly after this vehicle was totalled, courtesy of another driver who made a left turn directly in front of me in September 2000.)

I'm glad I chose my 4WD JLX+ Grand Vitara in May 1999 for a tad under $20k, all included, over competing vehicles like the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV-4, Subaru Forester and Nissan XTerra.  It was a great, peppy little pug of an SUV that's perfect for singles, couples and small families -- especially if you live or drive to where the weather is a challenge, where the low-range and high-range 4WD come in handy.

I loved the little extras that were included with the GV, like AC, rear defogger, cruise control, rear wiper/washer, and even a little light inside the drawer-that-would-be-an-ashtray-if-I-smoked.

I didn't like the strangely missing things, like an armrest (I had one added), an idiot light to warn me that I'm REALLY close to running out of gas, and the substandard sound system that comes with the vehicle.  And the darn rear gate opened from left to right, which, in the USA, is the &quot;wrong way&quot; for loading or unloading things from or onto a curb that is the right of the vehicle.

Driving the GV was a pleasure.  Its 155 HP engine delivers great low-end torque and shifts smoothly.  Up until 85 mph or so, it's very confidence-inspiring, despite it's springy and rugged suspension suitable for REAL offroading with confidence.  Mileage could be better: I got about 16 MPG overall, which, given the much-smaller-than-Durango size of the GV, is not impressive.  (Indeed, as I revise this opinion after the accident, I must say that the relatively low mileage, combined with the hike in gas prices since I'd bought this car, are factors in my choosing a more gas-efficient vehicle next.)

But I wouldn't change my SUV if I could choose differently.  I had looked forward to driving mine for many years to come -- when the aforementioned accident occurred, totalling my lil Suzuki.

This car just might have saved my life.  Though it is hardly the Giant Cage Of Steel that you might get in a Suburban, its airbags and crumple zones kept me from far more serious injuries.  (I can't speak for it as to side impact collisions, as mine was head on with the other driver.)

If it weren't for the relatively low MPG (and the higher price of gas these days) and the intangible psychological desire NOT to be looking out over the same hood I was looking out over when the accident happened, I WOULD have gotten this car again.

What did I get instead?  A Honda Accord.  Call me a lemming, but I WANTED bland after being in an accident ... yet often I miss the peppy (and, apparently, rather safe-in-crashes) pug I used to drive.<br><br>
