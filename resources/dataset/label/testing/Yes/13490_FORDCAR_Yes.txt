            99 Explorer Sport

      I recently purchased a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport.  And when asking myself why I purchased it, I recalled being in high school and having the usage of a &quot;SWEET&quot; 1988 Jeep Wrangler.  It was one of the most fun, exciting, wild rides I ever had.  It was fully equipped with 16 inch wheels, hard top, soft top and loads of other goodies.  Among my raves were: the high driving stance, four wheel versataility, the Jeep aura and the convertible/hardtop versatility.  Unfortunately, the Jeep also had characteristics I didn't like such as: bad fuel economy, and horrible aerodynamics that made freeway driving a painful experience (with or without the hardtop). The 99 Explorer Sport in comparison to the legendary Wrangler/CJ descendants incorporates the the best aspects of the Jeep without satisfying highway comfort and convienance.
      The 1999 Sport I purchased was white and loaded to the gils with  silver fender flares, factory silver nerf bars, fog lamps, 16 inch alloy wheels, tinted rear privacy glass, am/fm tape/cd and a cargo cover.  Immedediately I fell in love with the vehicle.  For an S.U.V the acceleration is great, the handling is great, and the overall comfort of the car is outstanding.  Also, being a single male professional the car fits my lifestyle( I can carry almost everything I own in it), and conveys the image I want to project.  I've taken it off road already a couple of times and am impressed by the Explorer's off road skills.  Also, I am very impressed with the Explorers highway manners, the ride is quiet and smooth and overall the Explorer is a pleasure to drive.  <br><br>
