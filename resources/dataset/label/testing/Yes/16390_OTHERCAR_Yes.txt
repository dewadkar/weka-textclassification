                 To be honest, I have always had an affinity for the 7 series BMW.  My father owned the 1997 750iL before purchasing his 1999 CL 600.  The Mercedes became mine in January of 2001 after the Turbo Porsche that he ordered finally came in.  I had been driving a 1995 Lexus ES 300 for 6 years, and it was time for a change.  This car was an incredible leap up from the Lexus.  There are so many outstanding aspects of this car, where do I even begin?

 Firstly, in my opinion the styling of this car is unsurpassed by any other luxury car manufacturer.  The sleek body shape coupled with the subtle yet commanding lines and edges on the body make for a car that is both eye catching and aero-dynamic.  The SL-like mounting of the Mercedes emblem in the grille instead of the traditional hood ornament help greatly to enhance the striking appearance of this car.  Its a car very sporty, and at the same time, extremely luxurious.  This coupe has all of the Luxury features that any sophisticated automobile connoisseur could possibly ask for, (and some that they would never think of).  This car has the navigation system, 12-way power heated passenger and driver seats, cruise, xenon lights, dual zone temperature control, and an excellent suspension system with ESP (Mercedes' electronic skid protection). I decided to add remote start, just for a little extra fun. 

     Now, as I'm sure you are all wondering, just how does this car drive? Well let me say this: for the weight of this car, nearly 4500 pounds, man can it ever move!  The 6.0 liter 389hp V12 takes you to 60 in just about 6 seconds, and does the quarter mile in well under 16 seconds.  The car will cruise at any speed that you desire, even speeds pushing over 150mph, but that should be reserved only for the Autobahn.  Now of course I was bad, and did some serious speeding, but with that kind of power at my disposal, how could I resist?  I got the car to 140mph, and it wasn't even breathing hard.  It had no difficulty maintaining that speed.  The 5 speed automatic transmission of this car is all that it needs.  The interior is very quiet on the road, you hardly even hear the engine at low RPM's, but once they get over 3000, you hear the beautiful sound of nearly 400 horses galloping full speed ahead.   The suspension of the car is excellent, offering an extremely smooth ride.  The handling is fairly good, however, it does have some oversteer, but the ESP system tries hard to correct that and for the most part does an admirable job of getting the car back under control.  The interior is very nice, with leather everywhere, and a mahogany dash.  It also comes with an 8-speaker Bose stereo.   Gas mileage is about what you would expect with this car, about 17 around town and 24 highway, but this can vary considerably depending on just how aggressively you drive.

 Overall, this an awesome car.  In my opinion, when compared to other luxury cars in its class, it comes out on top.  Put it up against the BMW 7 series, the Audi A8, or the Lexus LS 400, the Mercedes is sure to impress you the most.  And though it is quite a bit more than any of those cars, you must remember that it is a Mercedes.  For that money, not only do you get an extremely safe car with a steel  frame and 6 airbags, but you get a car that is chic, classy, and very much ahead of its time.  There is only one thing that I would change about the CL.  It seems that the heavy V12 may be unnecessary.   For the amount of horse power, a supercharged or turbocharged V8 may be able to do just as well as the NA V12.  However, the V12 has been working for Mercedes for quite some time now, so maybe just a boost in horsepower to over  400 is in order, while keeping the V12.  I wanted the extra power, so my CL will soon be on its way to  RennTech.
