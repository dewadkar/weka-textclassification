            The details on my truck are: Chevrolet Silverado Z71 Shortbox Extended Cab, automatic transmission with 3.73 gears, Auto 4-Wheel Drive, 5.3 liter V8 with the Tow/Haul option on the transmission and the heavy duty trailering package.
This is my first truck so I did a lot of research before buying one. My research showed that the Chevy has more standard features that I actually need/like as well as more room. The extended cab model that I purchased has plenty of room (largest of all extended cabs) for me and 5 others. I opted for the bench seat simply because it's nice to have the extra room when needed. It comes standard with 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and dual airbags. The features I enjoy the most are the seatbelt design, automatic sensor that turns on the lights when it gets dark, Automatic 4x4, Z71 option and the cool auto-dimming mirror with compass and temperature gauge built in. Automatic 4x4 option allows you to push a button and allow the truck to automatically switch between 4-hi and 2-hi when the road conditions change, living in Minnesota this is a nice feature! The Z71 package adds guards and longer suspension while not sacrificing on the ride quality, and for $395 probably the best money spent option-wise. I really enjoy this truck and I am very satisfied with it. My Father is now considering purchasing a Chevy the next time around because of the standard features and added room on the extended cab models vs any other truck. It is also the quietest and most comfortable truck I have been in.
