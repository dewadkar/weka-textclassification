            This is my first Civic, and I must say, I am very pleased. I received a great deal on the car, paying just over $18,000, but the Civic EX 4 door with 4 speed automatic can spill into $20,000. The build quality of this car is great, it never jolts or rocks over dips or bumps in the road. I was very suprised to find excellent pickup on a car with a V-4 127 bhp engine. The car was clocked going 0-60 mph in 8.1 seconds. Low speed acceleration is great. The gas mileage is very high, ranging between 33-39 mpg, peaking at the high 40s in cruise control down the highway (from what I've been told). Everything is very easy to reach, as the dashboard is high and sloped, positioned right next to the driver. The only problem I really had is that the interior is SOMEWHAT plain considering this is a top of the line model. I don't care though, the car is extremely sharp looking. This is a great car and I highly recommend this over the others in its class. Its main competetor, the Ford Focus, is very underpowered compared to the Civic.<br><br>
