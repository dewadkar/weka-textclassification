            I have had my 2001 Focus Wagon for about 5 months to date. This thing has impressed me from day one. At the time of purchase I worked for the dealership where I bought it. My main reason for purchase was I knew it was a good car, and the price was right. 

A week after we got it, I actually bought it for my wife, we took it up to New Hampshire on a weekend trip. I was amazed. Mine has a five speed mated to the 130 hp Ztech Engine. I tackled the hills of Connecticut without even the hint of desiring a downshift. The suspension soaked up the twist, turns, and bumps that traditional New Hampshire backroads provide. 

It now has just turned 8,000 miles. The only service has been an oil change. The car has not even hinted to a problem in design. The back, I have a wagon, is cavernous compared to comparable models I've seen. I have a 1993 Suburu Impreza that while in the same class, it doesn't come close in room, ride or power. 

My only issues are the cup holders are so useless that Ford actually sends you a specially designed Stainless Steel mug in the mail after purchase. Nice mug, but it's about your only choice for coffee. I would also like to plug in a cell phone and be able to use the cigarette lighter or radar detector. In this era multiple power points are as necessary as cup holders are. 

I do not regret the purchase. It's a great car, and thanks to Ford's generosity, I can still enjoy coffee on long drives.
