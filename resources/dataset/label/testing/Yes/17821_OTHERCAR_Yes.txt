            I attended a MotorTrend event, where I got to drive Mercedes S500, new 2004 Audi A8L and BWM 745i on both performance and luxury courses. The S500 turned out to be a disappointment in several areas.

<b>Exterior</b>

You be the judge of S500&#146s exterior. It looks dated and not as pleasant as Audi&#146s to me.

<b>Interior</b>

Firstly, the interior looks somewhat cheap, especially with lighter-colored interiors &#150 the hard plastic of the upper dashboard is unsuitable for such an expensive automobile. I am also not a big fan of the controls &#150 the transmission shifter, which doesn&#146t move in the straight line is just ridiculous, although easier to use than BMW&#146s electronic column shifter (at first). The instruments are quite readable, but dot-matrix displays close to the speedometer look dated.

By the way, I really liked Audi A8L in the areas where I disliked the S500. The interior looked much more modern and luxurious with soft-looking plastics, chrome rings around instruments and elsewhere. The Audi uses &#147regular&#148 shifter, which is easier to use and looks nice too.

The S500&#146s power seat controls, however, are located on the doors and are much easier to use than BMW&#146s (and Audi&#146s too). But the multi-function stalks on the steering column are overly complicated to use.

The S500&#146s power seats are comfortable and easy to adjust. The power-adjustable steering wheel is also nice.

<b>Ease of Use</b>

I already mentioned the not-easy-to-use shifter. The COMMAND system is not easy to use either (although neither is the BMW&#146s iDrive, which is almost impossible to use). The dashboard of the S500 has multitude of buttons, which is not such a good thing.

The 14-way adjustable electric seats with position memory (for 3 people) have heating and cooling. The steering wheel tilts upwards automatically simplifying entry/exit.

The fully-automatic multi-zone climate control has a charcoal filter for occasions when the outside air is contaminated and it also has a dust/pollen filter.

The Distronic adaptive cruise control can maintain the distance to the car in front.

<b>Handling</b>

You would expect such a complicated, AirMatic suspension-equipped automobile to handle well, despite its mass. It doesn&#146t. At least not better than the 745i or A8L. On the performance driving course, the car experienced more body roll that either Audi or BMW. The steering is over-assisted and non-informative. It also manages to be slow (even while being over-assisted).

The car understeered in turns &#150 something that neither A8L nor 745i did. And the slightest throttle application exiting turns would cause the 5-speed transmission to drop a couple of gears, which would unsettle chassis substantially. The car also feels heavy.

I do realize that the S500 is not designed to be a driver&#146s car or provide good handling in twisties. It should, however, perform well on the highway and in city driving, and that it does. 

The acceleration felt better than the Audi and close to the BWM. The sound during acceleration was pleasant (but louder than Audi&#146s). The transmission&#146s eagerness to drop a couple of gears quickly is a great asset while passing cars in traffic, and the S500&#146s transmission performs the kickdown immediately, without hesitation. But the body roll is still a bit concerning.

The brakes are excellent and are quite easy to modulate. Also, the suspension absorbs bumps with aplomb &#150 the &#147luxury&#148 driving course had some imitated potholes and speed bumps.

The car feels very solid and gives occupants the sense of security. The steering wheel&#146s rim has just the right thickness to it, but the steering, as I have previously mentioned, is over-assisted <i>and</i> slow at the same time.

The S500 is not a paramount of the fuel efficiency either &#150 with some idling and low-speed operation, the computer showed me 7.3 MPG on the &#147luxury course&#148. But, of course, large V8 engine and heavy car good fuel economy do not make.

<b>Conclusion</b>

The S500 has good creature comforts, excellent acceleration, solid structure and good ride. But its handling is worse than competition, steering is slow and over-assisted, interior looks dated and somewhat cheap. I would get Audi A8L instead.
