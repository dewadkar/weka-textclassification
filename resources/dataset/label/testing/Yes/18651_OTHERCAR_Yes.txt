            The title really says it all about the Acura NSX.  It is a supercar that you can drive to work everyday.  It's the only exotic that you can say that about too.  Some purists suggest that the NSX is endowed with too much technology so that you don't get the full exotic experience.  To all those people I have one question: How often do you drive that exotic sports car of yours compared to that SUV you also, inevitably, have sitting in garage?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I've seen people return 5 year old Porsches with 13 miles on them.  Call me crazy, but when you buy a car I tend to think you should at least drive it further than to the grocery store...once.  

The NSX has plenty of horses under the hood to get it anywhere you want to go...fast.  The engine, in it's current rendition, is a 3.2 liter all aluminum, DOHC V-6 employing Acura's patented VTEC technology, rated at 290 horsepower at 7100 rpm.  However, this is just for the manual transmission.  With the electronic sportshift you get a 3.0 liter rated at 252 horsepower at 6600 rpm.  The engine isn't the only place where aluminum is used on the NSX, most of the car is constructed from it.  The main body, the suspension and of course the wheels.  The use of aluminum makes the NSX light and very strong.  One of the more cool high-tech components of the NSX is the fly-by-wire throttle.  All these things make for a very well mannered exotic, something nearly improbable.

If you want to go fast just for the sake of going fast and really don't intend to drive the car to work, or for that matter very much in general, then you don't really need to consider an NSX.  An NSX is a car that's really meant to be driven and not stored.  That's why there are all those fancy gizmos in it to make it easier to drive.  If you want a fly the the seat of your pants experience where you can barely contain the car, then I might I suggest a Viper.  It will take all of your attention and maturity to control that machine.  But if you want a supercar that's fun and easy to drive, with killer looks then you can't do any worse than an Acura NSX.
