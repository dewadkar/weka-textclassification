            Hello everybody,

I own a Sony CyberShot DSC-P71 Digital Camera for more than 6 months. With small exceptions I am overall very pleased with it; I think it is a wonderful piece of technology, a good investment and return of investment. I am only an amateur photographer, but please take some time to taste my experience with it.

First of all the package contains the camera, a small memory card, a charger, a set of 2 batteries NiMH, a USB connection cable and a TV connection cable. The charger can be used with other batteries as well, but I would advice using the Sony manufactured ones more, as they seem to last longer. First time charging takes a loong time, so do this first as you open the package and then take your time reading the manual and getting used to the thing.

The Camera:
We are talking about a nice product, small in dimensions and easy to use. Try holding it in your hands; it doesn't taste so professional like the heavy Canon Powershot G2, but it fits great and is very light in one hand only. The batteries, that usually make a camera weight much are only 2 with this model, this also makes the camera not heavy. The controls are intuitive, and if you read once the manual you shouldn't have any problems understanding how the camera works.
There are shortcuts for the automatic picture mode for example, that are useful to learn. The LCD is clear and with a high level of detail. A nice feature is a small red light in a corner of the camera that lights whenever the camera reads the memory stick; it's interesting like a computer harddisk light.
PC syncronisation is very easy; once the drivers are installed you see the camera like another drive in your computer; this makes transferring/deleting files a piece of cake. Actually I used the memory stick a few times to transfer some bigger files between two computers without any problems.
The video out is a nice feature; however I needed a converter from the TV cable that comes with the camera and the Scart connection from my TVs.

Picture Quality:
is very good. Outside pictures are great, when daylight conditions are  good, the quality of the colors is excelent. When it's dark or when there are strange light conditions the pictures can get sometimes dark; so for indoor and low light pictures i would always recommend to use the flash. Now beware, there are three levels of flash, I set it to maximum thinking that this will make my night photos much clearer. After one month i noticed that the night characters I made pictures of were in too big contrast with the background. I would recommend to set the level of flash according to the light conditions.
The automatic mode is generally ok. I don't know much about aperture sizes and exposure times, and this camera makes it easy for me not to need to learn this. However if there are motion pictures, or night shots, you could and should probably learn this manual adjustment parameters and play with them.
The resolution is great, 2048x1496 is the maximum value for the 3.2 Mp this camera has; and this allows a very good level of detail. 

Other features:
There are pictures effects built-in that you can use from the menu, like solarize, black and white shooting, inversed color. Most of them you can also achieve later with some photo processing program; allowing you better control. However tt's funny to make a inversed colors photo and show it to your friends on the LCD, then magically recreate the original photo by reverting again the colors in some computer program.
The movie mode is present, but the resolution is small and there is no sound, thing that makes the feature not so useful. I guess Sony preferred not to add some cheap microphone into the device only to poorly meet this feature. This is not a video camera; it's a photo camera that does a great job. There is also a multi-shots mode, which is supposed a sequence of very fast good quality photos but I never tried yet; probably a good alternative.

Recommended accessories:
First thing I recommend is buying a decent storage space. The default one is very small, only 16Mb in my case, and this is clearly not enough. A 128Mb should be enough to store about 80-90 pictures at the best quality possible. I am not going to lie, the Sony manufactured memory stick is a little expensive and doesn't fit into Ipaq storage driver spaces, but it works very fast, is also much smaller than all the "popular" ones and once you have 128 or 256 storage space, you will not care so much about memory limits. In vacations, I recommend taking your laptop with you, it is very easy to download the camera images and start shooting again. Also once you buy the bigger memory stick, don't throw the small one away. You can hide it somewhere into the camera bag and someday you will need it.
Second as importance accessory that you will need is a camera bag. Of course do this if you want to avoid having scratches on the LCD screen and take care of the camera on the longer run. If you buy the bag from the shop directly, it can cost about 30&#128 or more. What i did was to take the camera with me through some photo accessories shops and find a best suited camera bag at around 10&#128.
Other accessories I recommend are another set of chargeable batteries, because you wouldn't want to wait every time your batteries are depleated to fully load. Place the charged ones in the camera bag and you won't be surprised when the current ones go out.
What i also have as accessory is a small tripod, which I find useful when shooting night pictures and close looks, where a small shaking of the hand can break the picture.

Conclusion:
I used to pay a lot of money for normal camera films and photos; now all those days are gone. Sony made a good shot with this release, I might say. If you are an amateur and want to get into the digital business as I am, I recommend you buy this camera.
