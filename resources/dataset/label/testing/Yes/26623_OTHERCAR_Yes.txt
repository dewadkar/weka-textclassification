            Recently, I wrote about my family's 1992 Nissan Maxima, on the very day it was rear-ended by a tow truck and totalled. With a very capable and luxurious car gone from the family fleet, we needed a replacement fast. Instead of settling for another 10-year-old car, we decided to buy new, and just a week later, we were driving around in a brand-new Honda Accord EX sedan. Now, as if I haven't written enough car reviews already, I am writing what I have found about this newest addition to my family fleet.

<b>What we were looking for</b>

Since my sister was the primary driver of the Maxima and would continue to be the primary driver of this new car, she had the primary say in the decision making. Here were the criteria:

- Because it was the Maxima's large size that had saved her from serious injury, the new car would have to be at least midsize.
- For insurance considerations, the car would have to be a sedan, not a coupe.
- The transmission would have to be automatic.
- Because my sister wears contacts, she called for a sunroof, so that plenty of ventilation would be available without drying her eyes out.
- Antilock brakes were a must.
- We had a preference for name-brand Japanese models, but any competitive model from any manufacturer was fair game.

In the end, the Honda Accord EX with 4-cylinder engine was the car that best suited our needs - at the right price. I'll explain later why other trims of the Accord, and the competition, didn't make the cut.

<b>Exterior</b>

Bland, bland, bland! Our Accord is white, so it looks like a fleet car. Besides, Accords are everywhere, so it looks just like anyone else's car, even more so with its conservative, forgettable styling. At least it does not look aged, despite being around since 1998. But personally, I prefer sportier-looking Accords of the past, either the previous generation last sold in 1997 or the late 1980's models with pop-up headlights. I even have a friend who was shopping for Accords in 1997, and chose the sporty '97 over the conservative '98. 

At least I am very pleased with the details of the exterior. The white paint is very smooth and has no flaws anywhere to pick at. All the body panels line up perfectly. And the 15" alloy wheels are very handsome and jazzes up the bland car, although I am concerned about somebody stealing them down the line.

<b>Interior - Up Front</b>

The dashboard has a very pleasing shape to it, and I love it. The top side, which will take some severe beating from the hot Southern California sun, is hard plastic in brown, while the lower sections are soft-touch materials in tan; the two-tone treatment is very pleasing. I do object to the high placement of the glovebox though; it is so visible that it would be too tempting for a potential thief to break in.

The instrument cluster is typical no-nonsense Honda, with an oversized speedometer flanked by a tachometer, fuel and temperature gauges, and too many warning lights to count. Headlight switches and wiper switches are on the left and right sides of the steering column, respectively and logically. At the far left end of the dash are the cruise control main switch and the sunroof switch; it's nice to see that the cruise control main switch is not hiding behind the steering wheel where it's impossible to see.

In the center, I see climate control switches above, with radio below. The climate control is manual in this Accord, and I like the placement of dials and buttons, as well as having separate buttons for recirculated air and air conditioning. Below it, the audio system is an in-dash CD changer, able to swallow up to six (!) CD's. I would not advocate loading this CD player while driving, but otherwise it is very easy to use, also offering AM, FM, and cassette with clearly marked buttons. The sound quality is much better than what I've heard in my family's other Honda, the Odyssey minivan.

Speaking of the Odyssey, I see that the instruments and switches in these two vehicles are nearly identical. The only difference is the transmission shifter, which is on the steering column in the Odyssey and on the floor console in the Accord. I love this consistency.

<b>Interior - Seating and Storage</b>

The driver's seat is oddly designed. The lumbar support ratchets to maximum, then ratchets again back to minimum. Also, the seat height is power-adjustable, but everything else is manual. Nevertheless, it is comfortable, and so is the passenger's seat. I've spent some time in the back seat, and found it to be very roomy, without the crampy feeling I get in my Ford Contour, a car with nearly identical external dimensions (just to be sure, I parked my car side-to-side). The rear seat folds down, though only in one piece, but it'll be a nice feature as this is my family's first fold-down rear seat. There is also a trunk pass-through slot in the rear seat. As for the trunk itself, it is cavernous, with the location of the jack clearly marked. It even comes with a fluorescent switch to open the trunk from within, just in case someone gets trapped there.

Above the rear seat, there are three anchors for securing the child seat. It will be a welcome feature, as my sister is planning her wedding right now and will most likely be a mother within the next three years.

<b>Driving</b>

My sister does nearly all the driving on this car, so I don't get much time behind the wheel. Nevertheless I did a lengthy test drive one weekend. I found that the 2.3 liter 4-cylinder engine was very competent, even going uphill or merging onto a freeway, but it of course lacked the punch of the V6 engines I am used to. The 4-speed automatic transmission is a willing companion and shifts smoothly and at just the right time. It also helps that it is laid out in the logical P-R-N-D4-D3-2-1 pattern, but honestly I could just stick the shifter in D4 and forget the rest.

This car felt confident around the curves too, although I must admit that the steering feel is nowhere as direct or sporty as that of our now-gone Maxima or my Contour. My test drive, in the end, was a reminder that no matter what Honda enthusiasts say - and what kinds of modifications they put to their Accords, Civics, and Integras - the Accord is a family sedan first and foremost, not a sports sedan.

With the large windows all around me, visibility was excellent, including through the rearview mirrors. On the other hand, I felt quite a bit of wind noise when driving above 70 mph, which was surprising because the car was rather quite until that point. It even seemed noisier than my Contour, which is notorious for wind noise.

With the car being so new, the brakes were not yet broken in, so I decided not to push the 4-wheel disc brakes to their limit and trigger those ABS pumping sounds.

<b>Safety</b>

Coming out of an accident which may have been deadly in a smaller car, we were looking for a safe car. With the Accord EX, we seem to have it. Of course the requisite dual front airbags are there, and the side airbags come with the EX trim too, a nice bonus. Insisting on the ABS was a good thing. On the other hand, traction control is missing, and we would've had to buy a V6 Accord to get it, but in Southern California, traction control is rarely needed anyway, so not much problem there. Plus, this car is very stable and handles competently, so as long as my sister drives conservatively, I don't see any major accidents on the horizon anyway.

<b>Service and Reliability</b>

Not much to report here yet, as the first oil change isn't even due for a while. I am just counting on Honda's reputation for reliability. I do have to say that the purchase experience was excellent, getting an excellent below-invoice price and being under no pressure to buy any supplemental warranty or accessories.

<b>Why Accord EX, not another Accord?</b>

Now's the time to explain the purchasing process. As I mentioned in the criteria at the beginning, we needed an Accord with both ABS and sunroof. Since Honda makes each Accord trim level with very few options, the choice of EX was an easy one. The <b>LX</b> has optional ABS, but ABS-equipped LX's are extremely rare; besides, there is no sunroof. The <b>Special Edition</b> seemed like a good value, but we had to snub it because ABS was not even an option. The <b>DX</b> and the <b>Value Package</b> were not even in the game, as they lacked both ABS and sunroof, not to mention power accessories and other goodies.

<b>The competition we snubbed</b>

- <b>Nissan Altima</b>: It's sexier and more powerful, but ended up too expensive, as adding sunroof requires an additional $1400 option package we didn't need.
- <b>Nissan Maxima</b>: Didn't really want another one after the wreck, plus it's WAY upscale now.
- <b>Toyota Camry</b>: Very competent choice and a new model, but couldn't get a deal. The older Accord was simply a better deal.
- <b>Subaru Legacy</b>: I suggested this one for its all-wheel-drive, and there were good deals. In the end, the all-wheel-drive was the killer, because it's rarely needed in Southern California, just more parts to break.
- <b>Ford Taurus</b>: Awful depreciation and land-yacht image took it out of the running early on, as well as bad dealers and problems with my Contour.
- <b>Hyundai Sonata and Kia Optima</b>: Awful depreciation on these twins too. I've driven them before, and they have wobbly handling. At least they were the cheapest of all.
- <b>VW Passat</b>: This car would've been VERY nice, but the high price tag and the turbocharger turned us off.

<b>Wrap-up</b>

So the car-shopping saga is over, and just like hundreds of thousands of other people every year, we bought a no-nonsense Accord. Despite what Honda enthusiasts claim - and do to their cars - this is no sports sedan by any stretch of imagination. But for running around town, and occasionally carrying friends or stuff, my sister couldn't possibly have a better car than this, and I feel happy for her. Once she becomes a mother, she'll really appreciate the child seat fasteners - and the car's reliability at a time when she needs it the most.

If finances allowed, I would trade in my Ford for this car myself. But then, my parents would like to buy me, as an older sibling, something more upscale a few years down the road. With my more solitary lifestyle, even a small luxury car wouldn't be too far-fetched. Time to dream again. :)
