              I haven't even gone 3K miles yet, but so far so good.  Very impressed with the RAV4's handling.  It is a very comfortable car to drive, with ergonomically-designed seats which are nice to sit in.  Wish the middle arm rest was a tad higher, but not a big deal.  All the amenities are easy to reach, work well. 
  A different review mentioned that, upon hard acceleration, there was alot of annoying buzzing that resonated thru the car, but I haven't experienced any of that.  When I push the car into overdrive, I hear the engine buzzing, but the inside of the RAV doesn't rattle, it's quiet.  If there's any noise, it's from the tires going over rougher asphalt and concrete, but it's still relatively quiet inside.  
  I haven't kept track of exactly what mileage I'm getting, but I know it's been good, probably around 25-28 mpg overall.  That's one of the main reasons I got it!
  I am a little bummed about two things regarding the back seats that tumble up.  When you tumble them up, as I said above, you can't adjust the front seat all the way back, so if you like to adjust all the way back, normally, then you'll feel a bit cramped in that situation.  
  Also, with those back seats tumbled up you can fit quite a bit in the back, but can't utilize the full space unless you pop the seats out.  To compare with a Explorer for one example, if you fold the seats down, that surface is completely level with the back area, therefore you don't have to take the seats out for maximum surface area.  Am I losing anyone?  The RAV4 has a lower floor area, with the spare tire on the outside, while the Explorer and other big SUV's have higher floors with the spare tires underneath.  Which makes the folding down the seats and having a nice flush surface a convenient feature.  I didn't think about all that when I was testing the RAV, and didn't care about what it takes to get maximum space, but it is something to think about.
  With all that said, I am very happy with my RAV's performance, basic storage capabilities, and looks, and will eventually add on some Thule racks (on top and a bike rack on the back) and box carriers to have additional storage space.
