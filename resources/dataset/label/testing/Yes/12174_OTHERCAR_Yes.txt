            This review is being written in appreciation of the time spent by others doing reviews that I have read. There is information readily available about what features are available on the Lexus LS430 so I won�t spend time rehashing that. 

I recently purchased a 2002 LS430 with the ultra package (April 2002). My previous car was a 1999 Lexus GS400 that I traded for the LS430. Prior to that I traded a 1997 Acura RL3.5 for the GS400, and a 1993 BMW 750iL, which I traded for the Acura. I traded the BMW for the Acura because at 55k miles it started to cost serious money to maintain for stuff that never should have failed at that mileage. BMW�s attitude was that a car is a machine and machines break. Thus the switch to something Japanese (after I told a dealer that sold both Acura and Mercedes that reliability was important to me he said forget the Germans).

I took a 550 mile trip with the Lexus LS430 the day after I bought it and my impressions are based on that. I got 24.5 mpg when I average 80-85 mph. I got 27 mpg when I kept it to 65. At 55 (pretty hard to go that slow) I got 28+ mpg. Pretty amazing for a 290 hp blaster. That is better than my GS400.

The first thing that I noticed with the LS430 versus my GS400 was that the tightness and handling of the LS430 was not up there with the GS400. I now realized how precise the GS was. The LS is smooth though. There is no question that my trip was way more comfortable in the LS430 than it would have been with the GS400. The seats are very comfortable. The leather is soft and supple and I liked the fact that the bottom portion of the seat could be adjusted for leg length, giving a deeper seat. I am 6�1� so the extra length helped. I did a three hour and 45 minute stretch without a stop and I was not wiped out.

I live a couple of miles out a country road with a few nice curves. Having driven these curves so many times, and having challenged them with all three of my previous cars, I would say that the GS400 was best on them, The BMW 750iL next, then the LS430, followed by the Acura RL3.5. While the LS430 had noticeable body roll, I never lost confidence in my ability to hold the curve like I would in the Acura. Switching the air suspension from normal to sport mode made some difference, but not a night and day difference. The normal mode was satisfactory. The sport mode was better. Neither made it a BMW 750, or a Lexus GS400.

The LS430 accelerates with authority, especially when going from 65 to 85 mph for a passing maneuver. The imprecise handling and lack of acceleration above 60 mph was why I abandoned the Acura, which in all other respects was an outstanding car whose fit, finish, and reliability was equal to Lexus. On my trip I cruised some stretches at 95 mph, and it was a breeze. The car was silky smooth and noiseless. It tracked beautifully. It was hard to believe that I was going so fast. If you punched the gas at 95 it downshifted and pulled with authority. Wonderful! Even the flagship BMW was not as good (in my humble opinion), although it was faster. I read a lot of comparisons on the internet about the Infinity Q45, the Lexus LS430, and the Mercedes S500 and S430 regarding power. All I can say is that all three have plenty. The Mercedes S430 doesn�t cut the muster though. It is noticeably slower than those others, and that is why I don't mention it anymore. I won�t spend any time with this Lexus LS430 wishing it had more snap. That is all that I ask.

I experimented with manual downshifting prior to passing on the interstate. While the Lexus LS430 does not have a sequential �tiptronic� type transmission, it snicked easily from D (drive) to 4th gear without having to let up on the accelerator. The downshift was executed smoothly and quickly (quicker that a press the gas-to-the-floor forced downshift). The automatic kick down seemed to delay a little more than I liked.

I weaved in and out of traffic at high speeds effortlessly. It was sweet! Brakes were solid and easily controlled.

Now about some of the goodies. The navigation system is the best I have ever seen. My wife�s Arura 3.2CL has a great nav system, but this one is even better. The whole U.S. and Most of Canada comes included. My small (50,000) town in Oregon is in it but is not in hers. The touch controls are easy to master for common operations. The directions it gives are right on the money and it is has great flexibility in its set up. It responds to voice commands by pushing and releasing a button on the steering column. These commands can control the nav system and the audio controls through about 150 voice commands. You can access navigation functions with one voice command that take a up to four button pushes to get to on the touch screen. A voice confirms each one. You can switch audio or map functions with a word or phrase. It does a very good job of recognizing what you are saying, and you don�t have to turn the radio down to talk. With you hit the voice button it mutes the audio system before you speak. I thought that this would be a basically useless gimmick when I read about it, but having tried it out, I like it. It is definitely useful. As I have said, many of the navigation screen and touch features are configurable for convenience and preference.

One cool surprise that I got was that when I entered the street address of the destination that I was headed to in Washington, it immediately knew what city and state it was in. I never entered the city and state, just the street address. The system navigated me there without a hitch, which was appreciated since there were numerous turns that had to be made once I exited the freeway. It got me there right on the money.

My brother wanted to take me to dinner at a restaurant that he had never visited. Sitting in his driveway I just selected �menu, points of interest, restaurant, Japanese� and bingo, it listed three in the area, one of which was the one we wanted. I selected that one and it led me there and back. Cool!

I played with the radar based adaptive cruise control. It worked as advertised. I turned on the cruise control and hit set. A small digital display showed me the speed that I had selected. A little picture of one car following another popped up and I was locked on. If that car slowed a little, so did I, maintaining the pre-set distance. If it sped up beyond my pre-set speed I speeded up until I hit my preset speed then leveled off. If another car cut between me and the car I was locked in on, my speed slowed until I was separated from the cut-in car by the pre-set distance. If my locked on car pulled away into another lane I sped up until I hit the pre-set speed or came up on another car at the right distance. You can select from three following distances with a button on the steering wheel. A graphic indicates your selection and whether you are locked on to anything.

On the way up to Washington it started to rain. As soon as the first few drops fell the wipers took a swipe. These wipers are way cool! We passed a semi that splashed a bunch of water on my windshield. The wipers gave a frantic four wipes to clear the water then went back to occassional swipes. The nice thing about the wipers on the automatic setting is that you do not have to keep fiddling with the intermittent timing as the rain fall varies. It knows when to wipe again. Wonderful!

I used the radar based parking assist and I can see that in some circumstances it is helpful. This system tells you if you are getting within a couple of feet of an object in the front or rear when you are moving less than 6 mph (like when you are parking) I like the fact that a nice big display flashes up on the navigation screen indicating what is going on.

There are lots of little touches about the LS. Lights under the exterior mirrors illuminate where you step when approaching the car at night when you hit the unlock. The ignition illuminates and so does the seatbelt receptacle so you can find it in the dark. The temperature controls do an excellent job of keeping you comfortable without constant tweaking. You can set a �normal� volume level for the audio, and if you (or someone else) turn the volume up or down for some reason, one tap of a steering wheel mounted button returns you to your preferred setting. The driver can undo stuff done by backseat passengers like leaving headrests up or seats reclined. The three places to plug in a cell phone allowed me to have a radar detector plugged in and still charge both my wife�s and my cell phone simultaneously. Self closing doors all around. Some people think self closing doors are total fluff but some elderly people or children have a problem closing car doors. A trip computer shows miles since last refueling, mpg on this tank, average mpg, instantaneous mpg, elapsed time, and more. You can view trip meter and odometer at the same time on yet another display (couldn�t do that on my GS400 � the Japanese are finally catching on). You can record a brief (2.5 min) digital message to yourself with the touch of an overhead  button. This is good for leaving yourself a message or noting a phone number while you drive. The interior door handles illuminate at night when you turn the engine off so that you can find them in the dark.

What are some of the misses?

The navigation system cannot receive a new destination while you are moving. That means that even a passenger cannot make adjustments without you stopping the car. I tended to unintentionally bump certain buttons on the steering wheel causing stuff like changing the song selection on the CD or changing from CD to AM radio. The reading lights in the front are not as bright as they were in the GS400. I really liked those bright lights. The low beam headlight setting doesn�t seem to aim far enough down the road. This may be dealer adjustable. Pretty petty stuff huh?

Other cars that I researched and considered before buying the LS430 were the Infinity Q45, the Mercedes S430 and S500, and the BMW 745. Of those I only test drove the Benzes. I sat in a BMW 745 and went over it with a salesperson. These are all great cars. Browsing lots of internet forums left me of the opinion that the German car dealerships were arrogant and not very customer oriented. I know from personal experience that BMW is not even worth talking to if you have an out of warranty problem. The Mercedes prices border on just plain silly. You are talking $15-20k more for the same amount of car. Don�t buy that pap about superior engineering. They have good performance but the reliability lags Lexus. The BMW 745 is almost like a concept car. It is full of gee-whiz technology that at times seems needlessly complex. There is no way 745iL buyers won�t make multiple trips for warranty repairs, and heaven help them when the warranty ends. I was surprised at how many BMW 740iL (not 745iL, although there were a few of those) owners that I came across that traded them for a Lexus LS430. Reliability and dealer service were the two biggest reasons. They all said that they gave up some drivability when they switched to the Lexus LS430, but it was worth it to them. BMW prices are high too. So is Audi. It is a German thing. Once again I point out that even the worst of these cars is a very good car. These are the cream of the crop.

At this point I am very happy with my choice. Getting a break on price is not easy. 9/1/01 jitters have made the supply low and Lexus is selling all they can make. I paid $69k out of the door. No car ever made is worth that much, but hey, you�ve got to do what you�ve got to do.
