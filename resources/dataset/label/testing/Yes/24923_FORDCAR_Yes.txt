                 I originally bought my mustang because they are legendary and I had wanted one since I was a teenager in the 70's. Oh well, dead give away to my age, but according to dealer survey's people who were teens in the 60's and 70's are there biggest market. I think it's because we all dreamed of cruising the strip in &quot;home town usa&quot; in our new mustang, and being the envy of everyone. Some of us got them then, but some, like me had to wait till they could get there own. 
     Mustangs are the most collected and adored cars for mid Americans that you can find. It's the middle classes Jag. It looks great, handles like a dream, comes with a list of standard features that no other sports car can touch for the price range, $15000 to $24000.
     Everyone should own a mustang, because when your cruising down the highway, windows (or top) down, radio blasting, new tunes or oldies (depending on whether or not your a boomer with a dream): YOU ARE 16 AGAIN !!!!! and it's your first car on a new drivers license. That is the only way to describe the exhileration and excitment that this car gives.
     I cannot image anyone who would not want this car. No matter where I go in mine, everyone from 13 to 75 says &quot;really great car&quot; or &quot; you can do anything cause you have a cool car&quot;. So the appeal is for the masses! 
     If you can't decide what car is you, drive one. You will be sold, they come in all sorts of traditional and exotic colors. Leather and cloth interiors, and premium!!! sound!! on the stereo. The price is right the payment and interest rates offered by ford are great!! The new 3.9 and 4.9 engine have more power than any other new car I've driven.
     Once again the mustang is alive and well. Taking the streets by storm, turning heads and stealing hearts! So why not give it a shot, shouldn't you have the experience of a lifetime at least once.....And best of all you can buy a mustang and trade it years later and get as much or more out of it in trade. Plus! for social activity there is no town in the USA that does not have a local MUSTANG car club. Where you can mix and mingle with other owners and show off the glory that is your special MUSTANG&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
      So why aren't you on the websight (www.Ford.com) building and designing your on or at the dealer now. GO! GO!
