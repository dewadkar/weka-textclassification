            I purchased this camera because I really liked my brother's Sony Mavica FD-73.  I liked the ease of using a disk to store your pictures.  No extra wires, cables, etc.
It's very easy to use.  Take your picture, review the pics.  You can even delete right off the disk if you don't like one of the pictures.  
It allows you to videotape for 5 seconds, which I like.  I get my kids in action doing some funny things, priceless moments.  And I don't have to pull out the video camera for quick moments.
I just pop the disk into my drive, and I can send it straight from there, or edit it with the included software.
I haven't encountered any problems with this camera as of yet.  It's a great camera, but a little pricey.
