            I've had this car for about 1.5 years now and has proven to be a great family car.  When we bought it when it had only 16,000 miles and now it has 35,000 miles.  Yes this is low mileage for a 1996 model, we bought it from an old lady, seriously!

Since we've had the car we've had no problems and no work done other than routine maintenance.  It's been a very reliable and enjoyable car to drive.  My wife stays home with our son and she drives this car absolutely everywhere.  This is also the car we take on long trips.  Overall I have no worries putting my wife and son in this car and sending them on there way, I know it will get them back.

The strong points for this car is the powerful 6-cylinder engine that gets great gas mileage (30mpg highway and also around town).  The car is also has plenty of room.  My wife and I were shocked at the amount of room we had in the front seat after driving smaller sedans for most of our lives.  I'm 6'2" and I can stretch my legs out completely in the passenger seat.  The trunk is an absolute cavern and has plenty of room for baby stuff.  Finally, the A/C blows seriously cold air, even in the dead of summer with 95+ temperatures.

The only drawbacks are mostly matters of opinion.  I find the seats to be rather uncomfortable on long trips.  The car has what amounts to bench seats instead of bucket seats.  The other thing that annoys me is that this car loves overdrive and will shift into overdrive whenever it thinks it can get away with it.  This is noticeable when driving 45-50 mph up a small hill where you might want a little extra power but the transmission has already shifted into overdrive.  Overdrive for this car means very low RPMs so you have to really give it the gas to get it to shift up when passing on the highway.  Of course, low RPMs mean longer life too.

Finally, the car has a turning radius of a supertanker which makes parking and u-turns a bigger hassle then they should be.  The floaty suspension is another classic Buick trait that I could live without.

Overall the car is a great car to own, the only complaints I feel are minor.
