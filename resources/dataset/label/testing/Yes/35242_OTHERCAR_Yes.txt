            We bought our Trooper in November 1994 from a dealer friend in Great Falls, Montana.  It has seen hard use getting to our Washington State cabin on a bad dirt road, hauling a utility trailer, and driving around the western states.  I have done regular basic oil changes and such, and had the dealer do the major 60,000 mile service.  In all this time (5 years) the Trooper has had only one problem.  It needed the coolant collector in the back of the engine replaced due to a leak, and the excellent shop which did the work checked the data base, and told me that was the only problem of that type on record.  I would certainly buy another Trooper, and do recommend them to my friends.  Two others did buy them on my word, and are also so happy, one is buying another, after 140,000 miles.  If you need a true SUV- not just a car to take the kids to soccer or the mall, this is it.  If you need true 4-WD on a mud road, this is it.  If you need clearance, or a very sturdy vehicle, this is it.  I expect to put 5 more years and 100,000 more miles on mine.  I am 52 years old, and it is the best &quot;truck&quot; I've ever had.
