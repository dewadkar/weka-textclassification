            I was looking for a digital camera for some time and I stumbled on the MVC-FD83 on a internet auction. I had toyed with other MVC models at Walley World. Much to my surprise this model exceeded my expectations. The   photos are great at close distances. Picture quality does diminish in panorama shots but, this is not a big buck camera! The MPG  files are fun but, take some practice on getting the settings correctly set for the optimum MPG flick. If you don't have this one your missing out on the fun of digital photography.We live in Texas and take lots of e-mail pictures and send them to family in Wisconsin and Arizona. I'm hoping the rest of the family will purchase this terrific digital camera system.... <br><br>
