            When we were expecting our first child we never even gave a thought to the seating in the car.  At the time I was driving a 1988 Dodge Shadow and we found the back seat to be a lot less than what we needed with a rear facing car seat.  We looked into buying another car, but since I had left work to stay home with the baby it was not in the cards.

Then this year we found we're expecting a second child.  Now a larger car was essential.  I mean really, now that our daughter's car seat is forward facing it barely fit in the back seat.  Adding a second rear facing seat was out of the question.  I started searching for something in our price range, and came up with mostly small cars that wouldn't fit our needs.  We really wanted a four-wheel drive since we live in an area with a lot of hills, back roads, and nasty winter weather.  Then I found the Suzuki Grand Vitara. (Note:  I do not own an XL-7 as it wasn't in stock when I purchased my Grand Vitara.  This is just the only category for the Suzuki Grand Vitara on Epinions.)  

Other than being very affordable, the thing that first drew me to the Vitara was here I was standing next to an SUV that I didn't need a ladder to get into.  I'm barely 5'3" tall so finding a truck that the floor boards aren't sitting at stomach or chest level when I'm standing beside it was a big plus, especially when you have a toddler and a soon-to-be newborn to load into the back seat.  The rear doors are about the same size as a sedan and open wide enough to maneuver a large car seat or packages into the back easily.  Up front, all the instruments are laid out so they're easy to read and easy to reach the climate controls.  The one I have has the optional 6 disk CD changer in the dash, so I don't have to worry about the sound system much at all.

Driving the Vitara feels like you're driving a sedan instead of an SUV.  It handles well with minimal body roll, but you still need to remember to be careful on turns.  If you're driving to fast it WILL roll over just like any other SUV.  As long as you don't drive like you're on the final lap at Daytona, it's fine.  I've had my Vitara about 2 months now and haven't had any trouble with it, and haven't heard even the faintest squeak or rattle.  That in itself amazed me since I have a motor paper route on these back roads, which are not all in good condition.  Traveling over bumpy dirt roads, winding paved roads with huge holes in them, and driving from the pavement to the shoulder of the road hasn't effected the Vitara at all. I've also taken the Vitara through the field on our property (short cut to grandma's house) with no problems at all.  So far I've only engaged the 4WD once, and then I had to do it manually.  It doesn't bother me to have to do it myself.  Actually I like the control.  I'd prefer it even more if I had a 5 speed manual transmission, but with the stop and go driving I do daily it wasn't practical.

The seating is a nice quality and is comfortable.  the entire body of the Vitara is a little narrow, so if you have several large adults to fit in the front and rear seat they may be a bit cramped.  My husband is a rather large guy and we haven't had any complaints. Perhaps if I were a bit "fluffier" we would have a problem.  My sister sat in the back with her son and my daughter and wasn't too uncomfortable, but she did point out that if we have a long trip with 3 people in the back it is a bit cramped.  We didn't opt for the 3rd row seating, but it is available and I'd recommend it if you have more than 4 people to fit in there.

I do like the split seating in the back.  We're building an addition onto our home and needed to pick up some lumber.  Even with our daughter in the back we just folded down the one side and the boards fit in quite well.  With my paper route I haul 250 papers everyday but Sunday.  On Sunday I have over 400.  They all fit in the Vitera with no trouble and the extra weight doesn't effect the handeling or performance.  The V6 isn't as powerful as I thought it would be on steep hills and I have to give the accelerator  little extra to pull them without a drop in speed.  Even that isn't a big problem.  On flatter terrain it more than makes up for it with the power.  I have no trouble passing or merging into traffic at all.

The MSRP on the Grand Vitara JLX with Automatic is $20,599.  The local dealer was trying to clear out the 2001's to start to make room for the 2002's so they were ready to deal when I was ready to buy.  We paid $19,499 for our Vitara and other than leather interior and the 3rd row seating I think we have most of the other options.  We also purchased the cargo organizer for the back, which I recommend getting. It keeps my extra bottles of coolant, water, and roadside emergency kit of sliding all over the cargo area.  It also makes anything I put back there a little more compact so the stroller fits nicely.  The floor net, vertical net and rear door net all together were an additional $200 at my dealer. 

Overall I love the Vitara.  It's a nice mix of a family car and a truck that won't break the bank.
