            I purchased a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 single cab SLT 4x2 just four months ago. The new, more aggressive design definately contributed to my purchase. Mine is what Dodge calls a patriot blue(dark or royal blue). I got the SLT package as I wanted power everything. I also got the smaller of the two V8's that they offer, the 4.7liter magnum. 

Pros: I test drove the truck and the smaller Dakota. I have a tall upper body and my head was very close to the ceiling in the Dakota but I had all kinds of head room in the Ram. This was very important for me as I had driven an '89 Ford Mustang, which was very cramped. I was immediately set on the Ram. Now I had to just figure out what options/color I wanted. I decided on blue, but not light blue as I thought it looked girlish. Just my opinion! Plus the dark blue makes the crome front really stand out! Then I decided that I wanted power locks/ windows and they found me one with everything I had stated plus heated/fold away mirrors, and power pedals. It also came with an overhead console that contains a compass, miles per gallon read-out, and trip timer. It had carpet and a 40/20/40 split bench, which feels more like bucket seats than a bench. The steering wheel is leather wrapped and the console has a white background color which helps during the day(glare) and disappears during the night. I got the cd player w/ bass and treble control. I just got the four speaker setup, which consits of 2 6x9's in the doors and 2 5 1/4"'s behind the seat. They sound pretty good with the factory cd player but the bass is a little muddy coming out of the 6x9's.
The gear ratio's for the new Ram were lowered to improve acceleration at the cost of more gas. Personnaly I like the acceleration. 

Cons: The only problems I have had are that the headlight switch will sometimes not turn my lights off. It is rare, but annoying. If I get left with a dead battery because of this, I will not be happy. Secondly, the new gear shift(automatic) moves vertically down the steering column. I have had a problem a few times with it not always going ALL the way into gear. So far I have always noticed it before it ground. And finnaly, the other day I heard three successive popping noises from the front passenger tire well area. I pulled over and checked it and couldn't find anything wrong. It might have been the radiator's overspill which can make a popping noise, but when I got back in and started it, it was just reading warm on the thermostat. 
I am going to take it in for a checkup pretty soon and will update this review accordingly. 

Overall, I have been very happy with my purchase. I got an o.k. discount(23,000 -20,000). I have definately enjoyed driving it. It has some POP!
