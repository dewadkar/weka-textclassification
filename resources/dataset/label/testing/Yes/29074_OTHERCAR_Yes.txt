            I love my black Jeep Cherokee!  I feel bad for my friends and their Toyotas - especially when we're going up steep inclines and digging.

I bought my Jeep for many reasons;  I liked the sporty design, the size, the power, the &quot;Jeepie&quot; feel when I went over speed bumps or through ditches, the handling, sturdiness, the simplicity of it (I wouldn't feel guilty about taking it out in the dirt, which is what four wheel drive is for) and the price $$$$$.

The engine is awesome!  It's a 4.0 liter in-line six which means its got more powerful than any of the four-runners out there.  The Cherokee is smaller than all SUV's of its kind  on the roads.  There's less stress on the engine, because there's less vehicle to have to power.  My repairs have been oh so minimal.  I also like knowing I can pull things with ease if the situation ever arises.  My gas bill didn't even increase that much.

The price can't be beat.  You can expect to pay considerably less than you would for a Passport, Pathfinder, Blazer, Jimmy, Four-runner, etc.  I don't feel guilty for taking my Cherokee through mud puddles, or worry when I catch a snag from a tree branch.  I realize that my vehicle isn't something that needs to be kept in a glass box.  

The newer Jeeps are comparable to some of the Grand Cherokees out there interior-wise.  It makes for nice long drives.  The back seat can get a little cramped if you're tall.

Depending on the year you're looking at, the seals can be leaky.  I think Chrysler has nipped it in the bud for the new Cherokees.  Bear in mind though, that lots of vehicles out there suffer from the same malady as well.

The Cherokee rides like a Jeep.  If you're in to a smooth ride for a sensitive tush then you might want to look at a Grand Cherokee.  I like the Jeepie feel because it reminds me that I'm behind the wheel of a rally machine.  The driver's abilities behind the wheel are a huge influence on the ride for the other passengers.

This has been my dream vehicle for my family.  I have a small (only) child and it's the perfect size to scoot around.  I feel safe knowing if I was in any sort of bind nature-wise I could get out.  It's a sturdy vehicle in my opinion compared to some of the cars and vans I've seen out there on the road.  The clearance is just enough to make for a nice excursion into the mountains with the family.

I will own newer versions, I'm sure in my lifetime, but I can't see myself ever driving anything other than a Jeep Cherokee!
