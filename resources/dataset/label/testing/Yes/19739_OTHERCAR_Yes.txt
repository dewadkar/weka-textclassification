            An impulse buy this was has turned out to be a really dependable trustworthy camera with fantastic outdoor shots and decent enough indoor shots. but not all is rosy,

First off battery life,
really good (400-500 outdoor shots) but it also draws a small current when in standby which can drain the Two AA's in 3 weeks. Not good.

case plastic, horrible cheap taiwanese silver painted poor wearing recycled Coke(tm) bottles, be really careful with it)

start-up time, Sllooooowwwww? can take up to 8 seconds with the included 16 MB card, up to 25s with a 128 I put in it

Terrible, slow, bloated software which chews my 500 mhz with 128 mb RAM to a grinding halt.

No pic review screen just a "mode" screen like your 35MM

Good enough pics in almost any conditions, simple press and "beep" interface.
Flash works better than expected.
Movie mode @10 fps really works well. BUT requires a SPCA504 codec to decode the avi's (included in software)


PROS, Super simple, removable memory, outstanding battery life, Cheap price.

CONS, Cheap n" nasty casing, poor low light or artificial light pictures, Bloated badly made software

At the time is was really really cheap and a great dependable buy for the money but is so outdated now look elsewhere unless you find it for $40 - $50

uses CMOS sensor with Sumplus SPCA504 chipset and delivers generally good pics with a good light response time,
EXACT same "guts" is used in the ritzcamera DIGI-DISPOSABLES
diff layout and firmware
