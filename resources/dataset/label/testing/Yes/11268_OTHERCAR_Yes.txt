            Our family decided to break down and buy a gas-guzzlin SUV and join the army of them you see out on the road.  The main motivation was the car would be used primarily by my father and for years function had to override form.  He had to pretty active sons who when they were younger participated in all sorts of events, he loved to do yard work so needed something with enough power and room to haul trees, mulch, and what not, and basically he flat out didn't really care what the car looked like as long as it was reasonably priced, performed well, and most of all, rated high in 'Consumer Reports' automotive issue.  Well now the two active sons have grown up and have cars of their own, the yard has shrunken in size, but he still looks at 'Consumer Reports'.  So this led us to the Subaru Forester.

Flat out, this car is a nice bang for your buck.  It gives you a great engine which has very sensitive pickup.  So definitely watch yourself in close quarters.  It handles very well and offers a fairly smooth ride.

However, I do have a lot of problems with this car.  Ergonomics and design!  I really want to sit down and talk to the design team for this car because the interior leaves a lot to be desired.  The headrests in the backseat create a pretty nasty blindspot on the back right quarter of the car.  When making lane changes, you need to be cautious (you need to be anyway) but with this car, it takes me longer to check my blindspot.  I am also not a big fan of some of the controls.  To me they were a bit counter-intuitive from other cars.  

For example, the power locks, hitting down unlocks while up locks the car?  This is a minor issue but for me, it's magnified since I am not the primary driver but when I do use it I often think I'm locking the car, get out, check the door, and have to lock it again because I'm so used to other car locks.  The wiper controls are also a bit different from the standard with turning the lever will activate the rear windshield wipers but shifting the lever down activates the front ones.  The biggest pet peeve of everyone in my family, but most of all my mother, is the lack of a mirror in any of the flip-down mechanisms.  The back seat is also kind of cramped and I'm only 5'9.

I am also not a big fan of the shape of the car.  To me, the Forester looks like a glorified, yet irregular station wagon.  True, that is my opinion, but I am sure drivers will not be a big fan of all the bugs that splatter on the windshield while driving due to the very steep angle of the windshield.

The car drives like a dream, but its interior comes up way short in my book.<br><br>
