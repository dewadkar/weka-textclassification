            I bought this car in November 2000.  I wasn't exactly looking for a grand prix, but I had a limited amount of money, and when I saw it sitting on  the lot, it looked so much better than any other car I'd looked at.  I have never been in one before and when I first sat in this one I thought to myself, &quot;comfort&quot;. I was used to driving a Japanese import, and although they're good cars, they really lack room to move in.  I also have to say I love driving with a V6 engine.  It really puts a little &quot;four-banger&quot; to shame.  This car handles really nice and drives very smoothly but there are a few things that drive me nuts about it.  The low gas indicator and engine temperature lights come on all the time and when the engine is first started, it feels like it wants to stall on acceleration.  I know these problems are minor and can be fixed easily, but I can't help but wonder if they are particular to a 1992 grand prix or if this is part and parcel of owning an eight year old car.  Whatever the case I am happy with the car and I guess I shouldn't expect to much for having payed $5000.00 
I have only been driving this car for about a month and a half now, but I've come to  realize that in 1992 when the car was new, it was most likely aimed at older buyers, especially the LE model that I have, and I'm only twenty four.  It kind of looks dated in the interior, and not as sporty as I was looking for, but all and all it's a nice car for being eight years old and it's mine and I love it.    <br><br>
