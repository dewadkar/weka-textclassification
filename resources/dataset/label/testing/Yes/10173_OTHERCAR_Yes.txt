            After test driving and reviewing all the fact of this car it is easy to say this Lexus is top of the line and worth every penny. The exterior is sleak and new, not as rugged as some of its competitors like the Jeep or Infiniti, it looks small and durable. The engine is a V6 that is barely audible. Inside you don't even know when the car is on!

Safety is a key figure on the Lexus SUV, its engine drops out of the front during a head on collision and has is fully equipped with side impact door beams, side impact air bags, and front air bags for driver and passenger. 

Inside the drier, passenger, and everyone in the back seat is in complete comfort. The leather upholstery is aged and refined and is softer than a baby's bottom. The stereo system, air system, and car information like time, mpg, miles until empty, are all located on a central LCD monitor in the center dash. A blue tinted screen for day and night viewing it is a superior system of easy management and luxury. 

The navigation system i available along with a Nagamichi sound system with 6-disc player under the seat and 8 that's right 8 speakers inside for full surround sound comfort. Also available is phone system for hands free talking. Besides that heated seats and a sunroof are staples of this luxury SUV. The only downside is highway driving, the sunroof is rather noisy when open and that can be solved by opening the back seat windows. So not a real problem at all.

The storage capacity in bag is large enough for any sports equipment, bags, boxes, chairs, or any antiques you might find yourself carting around town. There is also a full size spare, First Aid kit, and tools under the trunk floor. All in all this car is made for a smooth ride of comfort and usability, if you are looking for an SUV the mileage itself puts all other SUVs and Cars to shame with 19/25 city/highway mileage. Go drive it yourself and you will be signing the papers faster than you can blink.<br><br>
