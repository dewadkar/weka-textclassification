            When I bought this camera I had never used a digital camera before.  This camera was cute, small and most importantly Cheap!  I bought this camera for only $60.00.

When I first started using this camera I was impressed that I could take up to 80 pictures without stopping to download.  But when I got them onto the computer I was disappointed with the picture quality and just didn't trust it to take pictures the pictures that would some day be memories for my little girls.  I also didn'y like the fact that it didn't have a flash and beeped every time the light was to low instead of taking a picture.  So onto the shelf it went for several months while I went back to using my 35MM camera.

One day I decided to get a chunk of the eBay market and list some of the girls outgrown clothing.  Out came my cute little digital camera.  yet again the picture quality was poor and I didn't feel I got the bids I might have with a higher resolution camera with a flash.  So I went out and purchased one that I absolutely love. (I wrote a review on it yesterday if you want to check it out!)

So here I am with this cute little camera sitting back on the shelf again.  I am a pack rat and absolutely hate to get rid of anything being raised on the expression "Waste not, want not".  So I decided to find a use for this camera.  I have a four year old little girl who loves to be like mommy.  When I put this little camera in her hands she just lit up like a Christmas tree.  I'd been considering getting her a camera for a while but the idea of developing film for a four year old seemed too expensive when you don't even know what the pictures will be of (fingers, carpet, etc.)  This was a fantastic idea because they download quickly and you can choose to print out only the ones you want for much cheaper than to pay for buying and developing film.  Plus there is no waiting for an eager girl who wants to see her pictures NOW!  Working together she's learned to take some pretty good pictures and is anxious to teach her two year old sister to use it!  She doesn't even notice the picture quality.  We've used these pictures for craft projects and to pass out to friends and more!  This camera has turned into a very valuable member of our family!

This camera seems to be made of pretty cheap silver plastic but it's more durable than it seems.  this clip broke shortly after the children started using it but it has been dropped many times and has even been through a major snowball fight and still works just like it did when it was new.

There is an LCD screen on the back that displays the number of frames left and whether it is in low resolution or high resolution mode.  there is a small viewfinder beside it.  The shutter release is on top of the camera.  There lens is inset for protection opposite the LCD screen.  The camera itself is 6 inches tall and two inches wide.  The camera comes with software explained in the next paragraph along with a USB cable (very quick downloads), stand, user guide and manual, and 2 triple A batteries.  The batteries last surprisingly long.  We are able to take about 160 pictures and download them before changing the batteries as long as you do this almost all at once.  They last less long when you haven't used the camera in a while but have pictures stored on it.  I don't know why.

The software included is fantastic.  The PenCam manager installs easily and is all you need to get the images from your PenCam to your computer.  It was loaded automatically into C drive for me which may bother some but was great for me because I never know what to do with all that stuff!  It also came with Ulead Photo Express 3.0 which is absolutely great for fixing up pictures, storing them in albums, and sharing them with friends in the form of web albums or printable calendars, stationery, cards, and more.  This software has an amazing variety of ways to fix and decorate your pictures like color, texture, effects, text, frames and much more.  This software was actually better than the software I got with my more expensive camera so I use this for both!

All in all I very glad we got this camera.  It has brought much joy in ways I'd never imagined when I purchased this camera!
