            This is my second car ever. I must say my first was very sweet. It was an 1984 Olds Cutlass supreme coupe with a speedy v8 engine. I just had so many probs with American cars. I have owned this car 3 years and never ever had a problem with it. NEVER!!!!!! I got mine at David Hobbs Honda and would never buy from anyone else. I guess a bonus is my uncle works there as a mechanic so I get 60% of the cars price and work so that helps too. This car is so fast......I mean speeeedyyy! I love the sunroof and and the leather seats....a definite plus.The customer service and sales people are very kind and do not pressure anyone. Honda in general has been very good with seeing how I am doing with my car. They send out quetionaires every few months and have even called me. My next car is going to be a 1998 Accord Coupe(black) which I am getting in less than a month. Good luck finding your perfect car!
