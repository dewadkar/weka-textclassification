            My husband and I purchased the Dimage X right before our honeymoon in New Zealand. We took it along with us and were so pleased!

I had owned digital cameras in the past that had such poor battery life that I had to constantly buy new batteries in order to refresh my supply. This was extremely annoying, especially during foreign travel, as I'd be taking a picture of an interesting spot, and the camera would poop out on me. 

This problem did not exist with the Dimage X. We'd have it out all day, and were able to get all of the pictures we wanted. Then, we'd return to our hotel room, plug in the recharger (with the proper voltage converters!) and have a fresh camera for the next day. It was really convenient, and we never even came close to using up all of the battery juice during any given day! That, coupled with its thin size, makes it the perfect digital camera for travel. We had great fun recording and playing back snippets of our vacation with the movie feature as well!

The quality of the pictures is pretty good. My husband is an avid photographer, and recognizes that it's really difficult to substitute a digital camera for the optical quality of SLRs. The innovative optical structure of the Dimage X allows it to be tiny in structure; however, you do sacrifice picture quality because of it, but only slightly, really. For the average user, the pictures are really quite good! I wouldn't recommend using the camera as your primary camera, but as a supplement, it's really a wonderful toy!

The camera does not come with a method of charging the battery inside the camera - you must remove the battery and place it into a separate recharger. It would be more convenient if supplied with a cable you could attach to the camera while the battery is inside, in order to recharge the battery. It's a minor inconvenience, especially since I am thrilled with the battery in general. I will never again buy another digital camera that uses alkaline batteries!

The camera uses a menu tree on its screen to navigate through its features. Its menus are somewhat tedious to navigate - for instance, you cannot delete multiple pictures off the camera at once - you need to either delete them one by one, or erase the entire disk at once. It's inconvenient only if you forget to erase the pictures after downloading them to your computer. If you are vigilant in doing this, then it doesn't become as big of a problem.

Finally, the biggest inconvenience is the placement of the lens! I am constantly forgetting that it's in the top-left corner, and often get my fingertip in the picture. Again, a minor inconvenience that can be major if you mess up a once-in-a-lifetime shot!

Overall, I am super pleased with this camera. It's a great little toy that will never replace my Canon SLR, but is fun to use on vacations and when sending everyday type pictures to friends and family out-of-state and overseas. A good buy!
