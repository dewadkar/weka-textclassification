            I on Rt 24 headed for Walnut Creek California, And I'm approaching my exit. It's a beautiful day in the San Francisco area, I've got the sunroof open, going 75, the local radio station playing, and all is well.  I know I need to drop a lane, and when an opening appears behind a smart looking silver Grand Am, I take it. I have only a few feet to spare. Just as I enter the lane, a cloud comes up from the road, the Grand Am's brake lights come on, and she panic-stops. Just as I put my foot to the floor, I see a tire twenty feet in the air- complete with aluminum hub- come bounding over the Pontiac headed right for me. I brake ever harder and the Sable stops flat. No control loss, pointed straight and I out-stopped the Grand Am. The tire lands about a foot from my passenger side door and rebounds into panicking traffic behind me. It was so close that chips of rubber landed in my car through the sunroof. As I started off, I noticed a Jeep Cheokee sans rear-mounted spare about a half a mile up. As I made my exit, I was very glad I had clean underwear in my suitcase.......

<b>That's a good car. Good car. Now stay!</b>
The Sable LS has great brakes. Better than any other rental car I've driven. This car had ABS or else I wouldn't be writing this. I highly recommend it. Extra highly. 

<b>Everything Else</b>
Engine- The 185HP V6 3.0 litre engine in this Sable was very responsive. It is far better than most of the other cars I've been driving when I'm traveling. It's no supercharged beast, but for extra power on merging, it really gets you where you want to go. You can also get a more powerful 200HP version. There was very little engine noise even at higher power. 

Exterior- Hooray! The Taurus and the Sable finally lost the bug-eyed monster look that has plagued them for years! The 2000 has excellent styling that makes it stand out. Nice rounded curves and understated front end make this Ford a pleasure to look at. 

Controls- Easy to use and understand. Everything was right where I expected it to be. The climate controls worked very well. AC was real fast- it cooled the car down in a big hurry. I prefer the wind, so I was happy to use the sunroof through most of the trip though. One neat thing was the adjustable pedals. You can move them up or down to your comfort. Very nice. The gauges are all easy to read, and well positioned. 

Interior- the seats were very comfortable with plenty of room in both front and back. (I checked) One thing I noticed was that the sunroof retracts into the car. On my Grand Prix it extends up and back, disturbing the airflow and causing wind noise. The Sable's caused much less noise and would have allowed for quieter conversation if I had brought along someone to talk to. The interior is well appointed, with evident high quality. There was plenty of trunk room. My two bags seemed positively lost in there. 

<b>Summary</b>
This should be on the short list for family cars or business people. It offers plenty of interior space, with an excellent engine, and great brakes (get the ABS- <i>REALLY</i>) and other safety features, and it's a pleasure to drive. I hadn't considered the Sable when I was looking at cars last fall, but after this experience I would have. Along with the Grand Prix, Grand Am, and Intrepid, this is now one of my favorite cars. And not just because it saved my life.   <br><br>
