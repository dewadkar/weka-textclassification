            I was driving up I-5 heading North to a friends when I spotted out of the corner of my eye this black beast sitting on the east side of the freeway.  The truck, from what I could see was sitting on a lot, so I pulled off the freeway and went to take a look.  Posted in the front window was a price of 19,000.00.  the truck was complete with after market rims, new tires 33&quot; Wranglers, duel Rancho rs9000 shocks in front and duels in the rear, a 10,000 lb hitch, black enamel shell, After market lift from truck toys, custom exhaust system and a killer 6 pack cd changer.  Needless to say I was hooked.  I love trucks and I was in the market for one.

I entered the dealer, made and offer and drove off later that day.  The truck has the 5.8 ltr v-8, strong and very tight.  As I mentioned it has an after market exhaust from Mesa Headers, all stainless with a 3 1/2&quot; ID.  Sounds great.  I have added a new computer chip, new rear and front gears (4:11), new intake system and a custom buff.  The interior is leather with dual electric seats, AM-FM CD changer, quad stereo speakers and a trip computer overhead.  Four wheel drive helps in all the skiing adventures.

I have owned this beast now for about 8 months and I can say with perfect confidence that I will have it for at least another 4 years.  The steering, gearbox and transmission are tight as a drum, no freeplay between gears.  I love the feeling of being up over the traffic, I feel safer than ever, especially with my three kids in the car with me.  Recently my middle son and I were rear ended at about 55 MPH at a dead stop.  Now your not going to believe this but the damage to the truck was about 800.00 to repair.  A scratch in the tailgate and a new cover for the electrical connection on the hitch was all it took.  The bumper was buffed out after being sanded and re-painted.  No bending or twisting as declared by the body shop, and it drives straight as an arrow still. 

If you are in the market for a truck, this thing is a beast.  It's roomy for an extended cab, great sound system for stock and the ride is comfortable for the amount of tire and lift that it has.  We drove it to Reno with the kids and we had no problems.  We fitted the trucks front center flip down seat with a small 9&quot; tv VCR for the kids to play Nintendo or watch videos.  Great move by the way.  All power options and a sunroof make this truck a pleasure to be in.  Plus it gets some pretty long stairs from passers by.

If comfort, toughness, style and power is in your thought I would check out this truck.  When I do buy another I will definitly get the V-10.  Pure power in the V-10 engine.<br><br>
