            In all the years that I have owned or leased automobiles, I feel that this car is one of the best handling and best seating cars that I've ever had the pleasure, of driving. 

My wife and I have back problems and found that the Alero was best for us.  I must admit that it is the first Olds that I have ever owned and I tried several other cars before deciding on this car.

Some of the cars that we tried were Mercury, Ford Contour, Lincoln Continental, Honda Accord and others. Price was no ral concern. We test drove about 12 cars looking for the tightest ride, best seating and fun to drive. The Alero, I must admit wasn't on our 'preferred' list, but once we drove it- well that sold us. We had already decided on the Mercury -filled out the lease form an then changed our minds.

I would highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a well built car that will also be fun to drive.<br><br>
