            I have driven the 99 "New Jetta" since January 99 and after 48k miles I have had no problems and have only changed the battery.  I love the height adjustable seats, telescopic (up,down,in, out) steering wheel, keyless entry, 60/40 folding rear seat for trunk access and all the other little features. Update: at about 60k miles I replaced the rear brakes and rotors.  I will need to do the same to the front brakes soon.
The switchblade key is a great conversation piece and is very convenient.  The alarm and remote entry options and the key are all in the same unit.  I'm surprised that other manufacturers have not adopted a similar design.  This key alone is a great incentive to buy this car (or any VW for that matter.)  If you haven't seen it, check out VW's website or ask a friend or a dealer to show you the key!
When riding or driving other cars I especially miss the height adjustable front seats.  This feature is very useful during long trips so that you can re-position yourself in a variety of ways.  The height adjustable seats combined with the maneuverability of the steering wheel make it a very accessible car.  My tallest friends that have trouble fitting in to or are uncomfortable driving other small cars have no problems in my Jetta's front seats.  
There is not much legroom in the rear but it is comfortable for me (I'm 5' 7").   The trunk is very spacious for a smaller car; I have slept in the trunk on a camping trip where I did not have a tent, (the new Jetta Wagon advertisement shows this but I have done this in the non-wagon version comfortably).     
It drives quietly at city speeds but wind noise can be annoying at speeds above 70MPH.  Wind noise is something I'm very picky about so this may not be that bad.  Compared to other similarly sized vehicles it is still at least average as far as noise is concerned at high speeds.  
The two things I wish were different are the following:  In the base model it is more difficult than need be to recline the front seat backs.  Secondly, I'd like to see a "greener" version of the Jetta, perhaps a hybrid or a fuel-cell version in the near future.
The only minor nuisance is that in very hot (above 100+ degree) weather, a waxy, oily substance leaks from the bottom of the doors occasionally. After three years of living in high temperatures it is still leaking. According to the dealer this is a known issue but does not affect the safety or integrity of the vehicle.
Update: Another annoyance is that the front bumper is so low, it easily gets caught on curbs when parking.  If you're not careful when backing out, you may pull it off! Once it detaches the first time (mine did only on one side), it will happen more easily the next time.  The repair is easy but it may cost you a bit if you don't have the tools/skills to do it yourself.
It looks very smooth especially with alloy wheels and tinted windows.
