            I worked at a Saturn dealership as a mechanic for a while, so I got to see an inside view of this car.
1995 was good year for the Saturn because the company had 5 years to fix all of the little problems with the car.  In 1996 that all changed when they changed the body style and few other workings, and once again they were back with a few bugs.

<b>Engine:

Fuel Economy</b> - Great!  The 5-speed trans will deliver 28mpg city up to 39mpg highway, and of course the automatic transmission gets a little less.

<b>Performance</b> - Pretty good.  You basically have 4 options between 2 different motors and 2 different transmissions.  You can get the 100HP Single Over-head Cam (SOHC, or SL1) or step it up with the 124HP Dual Over-head Cam (DOHC, or SL2).  Both motors are 1.9L, the only difference is the valvetrain setup.  You can get the 5-speed manual transmission, or the 4-speed automatic.  Performance-wise, I'd go with the SL2 5-speed.

<b>Durability</b> - I would recommend a manual transmission with any S model Saturn.  Rarely have I seen a manual transmission need repairs, but very often the automatics would need a new valve-body...a $300+ repair.  The 5 speed also adds a little performance.

The motor is a long-lasting one, AS LONG AS YOU MEET EVERY OIL CHANGE ON TIME.  When these cars miss a little more than a few oil changes, the dirt builds up on the piston rings and slowly causes oil consumption.

One repair that I did a lot of were alternators.  Especially in the summer time.  GM is cursed with low-quality alternators...if you hear a whining from the engine, have it checked BEFORE it goes and you gotta be towed.

<b>Handling</b> - Handling is pretty good.  Some cars come equiped with speed-variable assisted steering, keeping the same "tightness" no matter your speed.  I'm famous for taking off-ramps at twice the posted speed, and although I may get pressed up against the door, the car still holds the road with ease when I pop it in 3rd and give it some gas.

<b>Interior:

Space</b> - Space is decent, but passengers may feel a bit cramped.  Trunk space does seem small at times (even if I didn't have the 2 10" subs in the there), but the rear seats do fold down to carry extra large packages.

<b>Comfort</b> - Pretty darn good, actually.  I find the seats to be fairly soft, but also supportive.  I never have a problem when I make my 4 hour non-stop drive to my parents house, which is more than I can say about other cars.  The ride is fairly smooth, but it is not the quietest (I'm used to those darned Cadillacs).

<b>Controls</b> - I find the controls to be very straight forward, and very easy to find while driving.  The stereo is in a good location.  The door locks (and lock-rod assembly) make it harder to break in.  I really like the amount of little pockets, trays, and cup holders.  The console layout is very nice, I was impressed.

<b>Other Stuff</b> - I would advise against a sunroof.  Many times I spent a day in the wash bay testing the sunroof for leaks.  A few times the motor goes bad.  Sunroofs are not cheap to repair/replace.

Saturns are very safe (2nd safest in it's class, surpassed only by Volvo).  Saturns have crumple zones to protect you.  This also means that low speed frontal impacts will bend the undercarraige, this includes sliding into a curb over 10mph.  Again, not cheap to fix.

Saturns do develop interior rattles after a while...the insides are made of plastic, which tends to flex and work away from the attaching surfaces with time...nothing major, but can be annoying.

If you notice the car rattling a lot, the engine seeming very loud, and a lot of vibration (especially in the dash), the upper motor mount is shot.  We do a lot of these, but they're not expensive.

I bought a 1995 Saturn SL2 manual.  I have not had problems with it, and I take good care of it.  It's as much performance, comfort, and reliability that I need to get me where I need to go...but it's not a hot rod, it's not a luxury model, and it's not an off-roader.  It wasn't meant to be.  It's the perfect commuter car.
