            Most consumers would go through a wide range of research for them to find a vehicle that not everybody would consider best, but that would suit their lifestyles as close as possible.  Here we look at the 2003 Toyota Highlander which in M.O.H.O., might just be the perfect SUV of in-betweens.  

Highlander uses the same platform as the Camry and is a cousin of the more expensive Lexus RX300 now being more closely resembling the new RX330 to replace the former. You can choose the standard 4 cylinder, V6, AWD V6, Limited and an AWD Limited V6.  Options comes a little tricky depending on the state you live and what kind of packages the dealership would offer.  I opted for the least expensive 2 wheel drive V6 non Limited model which degrades to not having the moonroof, fog lights, heated outside rear view mirrors, Vehicle Skid Control, Climate control, leather seats, and the JBL premium 6 disc CD changer.  That sounds a lot but if you're able to save as much as $ 6,000 for the top of the line V6 AWD Limited Highlander, it's worth it. It come pretty loaded already with it's standard features like four wheel ABS, A/C, power windows and locks along with cruise control.  Just for thoughts, I drove my friends loaded AWD Highlander and it seemed a little slugish(full time all wheel drive), cabin noise a bit more noticeable due to the moonroof(maybe a seal problem) and the VSC which gets quite annoying when activated by driving conditions(can't turn it off either). I would admit though I'm jealous of the climate control system which works pretty good and not having to worry about those quick carwashes we take every once in a while for it does not have any exterior antenna which is nit picking even to mention it. Ride and handling is superb and cabin composure was topnotch.  It might not rival it's more expensive relative but comparing it to the Mitsubishi Montero, Nissan Xterra, older Toyota Forerunner and even the 2003's, I have to give it to the Highlander.  

Styling as far as the Highlander is concerned can't be one of those head turner, "wow look at that" kind of a ride.  In all honesty, I was a bit more intrigued by the Murano which runs under the Nissan badge but considering the experience and longevity Toyota's have done not only for me but for my whole family, the Highlander was a must.  The V6 engine is strong and I would say smooth.  Merging on freeways with the A/C on gives you a lot of confidence even with a full load of passengers.  The V6 comes with a 3.0 liter, 220 hp that delivers acceptable fuel economy 19 on the byways and around 24 on the highways which is pretty considerable, especially on the gas prices nowadays.  It usually takes premium fuel which is recommended by Toyota on the V6 engines but being new, I think using mid grade fuel won't do any harm.  It would take about $34.00 on a full tank until the indicator lights up reminding you she is hungry.(note the date of this review which at the time of writing, unleaded gas with an 89 octane is $ 1.84) Controls are pretty intuitive with the exception of how the dashboard was laid out.  I'm not complaining about the displays or anything but facing the sun on your commute might just devoid you of your current speed being buried deep in a trio of circular dividers.  In regards to entertainment, the factory radio wasn't the best either.  Most OEM radios have improved a lot but an aftermarket is still a better but costly choice.  Even with the JBL premium sound system found on my friend's is not something to rave for.  

I own a 2003 Highlander and justifying the over all value of this vehicle can only be appreciated by driving one.  I just passed the 3000 mile range and it's all nothing but bliss for a car based SUV that could pretty much tackle our everyday lives and then some.
