              This is the funnest vehicle I have ever owned!  I can go whenever I like.  I can climb steep Jeep trails and not even shift into four wheel drive!  The Jeep owns the off road experience.  
  The Jeep is very stable off road.  You will be very comfortable despite being tossed from side to side.  I personally think being tossed around off road is part of the fun.
  I have seen incrediable sights that I could never seen in a sedan.  Ghost towns, mountain vistas, rivers and wild life can all be yours in the comfort and saftey of a Jeep!
  A Jeep is not a cool replacement for a minivan.  They are small and have little cargo space.  These are two door vehicles and are not the easiest to for little ones to climb in and out of.  Not a choice for general family use.
  Jeeps are not designed primarly for city driving.  The 1999 Jeep Wrangler does have spring suspension which makes cornering easier then earlier models.  Despite this you will still need to take corners slower.  The five speed does stick a little in second gear when it is very cold.  If there is heavy winds, you will blown be around.  There is little side inpact protection that I can see. Although there are air bags and roll bar protection, I don't feel secure at 75 mph plus on the freeway.
  I love my Jeep but and I recommended to anyone who wants an off road vehicle.  If you are buying this just to look cool, this is not your vehicle.  This vehicle is designed for a specific purpose.  Keep your Jeep dirty and it will love you and you will love it!
