            What can I say about the PDC2300? I can say that it is one of the best and low priced cameras that I have played around with. You really get your money's worth out of this digital camera.

I bought this camera in June 2001 for about $350 with $80 in mail-in-rebates. I did end up spending almost $100 more on a 64-MB extra memory card. The camera includes an 8-MB memory card, but I needed more than that.

The camera kit includes:
2.3 MegaPixel Digital Camera
Computer Software
Serial Cable
USB Cable
Video-Out cable
8-MB Compact Flash memory card
AC Adaptor
4 AA Batteries
User's Manual
Wrist Strap
Camera Case

The top of the camera has optical zoom control, mode control, take-photo button, and an LCD display which shows you:
Resolution Setting
Flash Setting
Number of photos taken/left on current resolution 
Macro Setting
Flash/AutoFlash/Noflash Setting
Delay Setting
Image Number

The back of the camera has the 1.8" LCD screen, power switch, OK button, Menu button, and LCD on/off button.

So far, I've used this camera for tourism, taking pictures of old pictures, connecting to a telescope, family reunions, gatherings, and just about everything. I must tell you that the macro lense works great! The macro lense is a setting that allows you to take clear shots of something as close as 1" to the camera.

I must say that you have to hold down the photo-taking button for a second before you take the photo for best results. What that does, it focus is right. You also need to wait about 3 or 4 seconds between snapping pictures, for it to save to the memory card. And, as a nice feature, you can delete it instantly after you take it if it turns out bad.
