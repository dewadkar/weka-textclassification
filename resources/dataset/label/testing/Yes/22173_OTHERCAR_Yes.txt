            I've had my compact 1998 Golf for the past two years (I bought it from a friend who purchased it brand new). My biggest gain was buying from someone who I knew took good care of the car, so I did not have to worry about major mechanical problems when I bought it.

I've got the base model (GL) and it comes with the bare minimum. No AWD, no ABS, no cruise (its a manual transmission), no CD-player, and pretty minimal dressing-up inside. From the outside and inside it looks like a good, solid car with no-frills attached. I opted for the base model only because the higher versions costed a lot more than I could afford.

I've kept up the car as usual (without any major additions): regular oil changes, check tire pressure every so often, bulbs replaced every other year or so, car washes etc. I did change the stock tires/wheels to heavier chrome rims, and changed some of the exterior looks but not touched anything inside the hood.

The engine is powerful enough (2.0L) for the car (it is particularly heavy for a small car - but most German cars are notorious for it). The pickup is awsome! The car sits very close to the ground and has a really smooth ride, even over most minor-potholes. Over larger bumps and holes, I had to be careful of the front bumper hitting the ground (the plastic portion underneath the bumper). Around corners, the car handles very well. I didn't feel any inkling of instability or rollover tendencies (the center of gravity is precise.)

The exterior is not as boxy as the older Golf but considerably more square than the GTI. The headlights and taillights are practically rectangles with no attention being paid to the esthetic value of the car (I guess simplistic design could contribute to it being a "clean cut" car.)

The interior is similarly clean. No leather, no wood finish, just plain cloth seats and plain vinyl on the doors and dash. But they're all dark gray so it goes pretty well with my black exterior. It doesn't have the sophistication of a black luxury sedan with gray leather interior, but it tries really hard to copy that look!

The dash has all the regular features that come with the stock car. One good thing I liked was a slot (button) available for cd-changer/player hook-up. Although the factory does not install a cd-player or cd-changer in the base model, it does provide the controls for the buyer to fit additional sound equipment without buying extra controls. The layout of dash was OK .. but I like layouts which are easily reachable from the shifter. If you're driving a manual transmission, you most often leave your hand on the shifter and change channels while your hand is on the shifter (like in a Ford Taurus), however I couldn't do that in the Golf. Not a major problem, but a minor inconvenience while driving. (Additionally, the glove compartment is pretty huge for a small car!)

**Cupholders** - badly placed! Always had problems shifting if I used a medium/large glass (only a small coffee cup would allow me to be comfortable shifting). It also blocks the little trash holder quite badly.

I got pretty good gas mileage from this car. On an average it was 25/28 and with more long distance driving it gave a lot more miles per gallon. I did put STP in the car every couple of months to make sure I was getting the best mileage. Living in Colorado, we get 85 octane gas and I was using it happily in my Golf. Putting 93 octane gave it a 5-10 miles more but not that much of a gain (in terms of the extra cost).

I recently started having problems with the check engine light turning on with the A/C being on. I took it to the dealer and some other mechanics and they couldn't figure it out properly (something about the air flow meter). I looked in the AllData recall index but nothing has shown up for this particular issue so I think its just isolated to my car (and a few others?). The replacement for that would be around $600 I believe, but the dealer says you can work without that change for a while without hurting the car. 

4 adults can easily fit into the car as long as they're not overly tall. I often had to push back the driver's seat a lot and then only a child would be comfortable sitting behind me. The cargo area is amazingly huge for a small car (hatchback style makes it easy to access). If it were legal, two children could easily fit in the cargo area!

In terms of safety, VW is known to have cars that can withstand most minor accidents. I've never had any accidents in this car but at times when I've had to brake hard and quick, the seatbelts have been amazingly responsive. There are two airbags (one driver, one passenger) in the front, but mine have never had a reason to be deployed so I don't know how well they function.

But for a regular car, that can take you wherever you want to go without any problems (and without being a big gas guzzler) this is definitely the car to have for someone that is young and doesnt have a big family to fit in!

I'm updating this after a year of writing the above review. I realized that FWD doesn't do a lot for driving around in the snow (I live in Colorado) and have had to reluctantly sell my Golf. I did put good snow tires on it, but without ABS and 4WD there's little to be done. It had really good traction in the rain, and slushy snow, but when it got icy on the roads, driving the FWD got a little nerve-racking. If you are a confident snow driver, this car would still work, but I chickened-out and bought a truck!
