            My friend has a toyota and it is awsome. He take that truck and runs it through mud and  creaks and it still runs. We went four weeling one day and we came up to this creek and it was about 3ft deep. He had to think about it, but after a few seconds he guned it and took of. it went through with no problem. I tell you something else. It has 130,000 miles on it and still running strong. He will get 250,000 miles out of it. Think if you treat it good how long it will last. so if you are looking for a truck to keep you on the rd and never take you off. You have to get a toyota.<br><br>
