            I didn't plan to buy this car,but when I saw it I knew it was THE car I had been waiting for!  I love the easy comfortable ride. The visibility out the front and sides is great too. I never feel like I have a restricted view. 

It took awhile to learn all the gadgets, but they are all very handy. I love the digital oil gauge measure and the gas mileage indicator. This is the first time I have had a remote keyless lock. That is a great feature.

 The sleekness of the body of the car is very attractive. It was the first thing that I noticed. Once I drove the car however, I was hooked. 

I feel safe in this car. It is a substantially built solid car. With the tire pressure monitored I also feel safe on the road, knowing I may not have a flat tire without some warning.

 I would recommend this car to any age person. Being middle aged, I was ready for this classy car for a comfortable ride. I can picture myself driving this car for years. <br><br>
