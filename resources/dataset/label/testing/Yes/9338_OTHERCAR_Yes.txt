            Lexas brigs comfort and durabilty to gether with the LX 470. It ruged and tought body gives it the look of a tough body. The engen gives it the power of one and the interioir gives the comfort of a sudan. It has a smooth ride with great handeling I talk from experience. If you leas or buy you are getting a great deal. I have never had a proble with it before. The only time I have been to the shop is for an oil change.It comes with leather seets and will give you experince of a life time. When you get in you will not want to get out.<br><br>
