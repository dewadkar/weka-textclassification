            I purchased my MX-1200 on 11/08/99, I bought this camera because of the price most of all. I have been waiting for a camera to come out with the features of this one for a long time. I think that fuji should include a 16 mb smart disk with the camera though. With a 4 mb disk you can only take about 36 640 x 480 and only about twelve pictures in 1280 x 960, but with the 16 mb disk in basic mode you can take 117+ pictures. In the 1280 x 960 mode you can take about 50 fine pictures. I really like the camera for it's small size and ease of use. It is a snap to get the pictures from the camera to a computer. Start program hook up wire and turn on camera in PC mode, take pictures from camera, it's just that fast. This camera gives excellent photos in complete darkness. I take a lot of shots at night and have never had a problem. You can see the picture right away so you can tell what it looks like. Disadvantages of the camera, It goes through battery's fast, if you are going to by one I suggest you buy the optional power supply. Also if you use the veiw finder your battery's last even shorter so use it only when you have to, or carry a supply of battery's. <br><br>
