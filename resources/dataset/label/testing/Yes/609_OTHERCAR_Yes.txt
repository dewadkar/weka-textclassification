            The Nissan 200 Sx is the model built from the base of a Sentra.  The Sentra is a superb looking reliable car.  I have a
1996 200 Sx and have had no troubles at all.  I keep up on all my tune ups
and oil changes and I have to say it pays off.  The price is great for quality of the car.  I love my car, it has saved me lots of money, on the price and on the maintanence.  I have installed amps and all sorts of other stereo equipment that has not affected the performance of the car at all.  A manual transmission car that also gets great gas milage for those long road trips.  Nissan is overall a great company, we have a truck with 269,000 miles on it and it is still going.  Buy Nissan be happy<br><br>
