            This car is one of the most valuable car for its price range.  It holds the road better than most sports cars and has the power to outrun most of its competetors.  I bought this vehicle because it is made by Honda and their reputation is fantastic.  This car is very reliable and I know that I will never be stranded.  The car shift smoothly and briskly.  The cockpit has been designed to feel comfortable and not like a cockpit which could be a plus or a minus depending upon your preferences.  This vehicle is perfect for teenagers and people who are single that want a fun little car to drive.  The backseat room is minimal which makes it hard to become a family car, but it could prove to be a fun second car.<br><br>
