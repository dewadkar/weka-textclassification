            The 2000 Sportage I lease has options that help make it be as sporty as possible.  I don't do any off-road driving, so for me two wheel drive is fine, especially as it's a rear wheel drive.  To help get the most power out of the engine, I ordered the 5-speed manual transmission.  Finally, to save even more weight I ordered the alloy wheels. So, while BMW's still need not fear, I've been pleasantly surprised by the Sportages degree of performance.  Tires can easily be chirped taking off from a stop.  The German-built Getrag gearbox is smooth and easy to shift and 4th gear to 2nd downshifts can be accomplished heel-and-toe style, keeping engine revs up and allowing an easy transition from hard breaking to hard throttle.  Most surprising is how at ease and stable the suspension is during hard cornering.  I've experenced none of the tail wag I thought might come with the Sportage's short wheelbase.

There's easily enough room to carry five people and also plenty of cargo room. Plus in 7,000 miles it's not needed one repair. Better fuel economy and an easier to use hatch would be nice however.<br><br>
