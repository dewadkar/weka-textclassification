            The Pontiac Montana was exactly what our family needed. We'd been driving my '89 Buick LeSabre way, way too long. With my son in school and both of us on the PTA and activities for both children ramping up and.. and...

We needed a new car. Oddly enough, we had discussed purchasing a minivan, especially the Oldsmobile Silhouette: safe, spacious, economical (well, not in terms of gas, but in terms of initial costs), great for trips. But then, on a trip to New Mexico, we had rented a Mitsubishi Montero. Oooh. Aaah. We liked that vehicle very much, and for a while, my wife kept talking about how she wanted an SUV. Like that Montero we rented. Yea, I wouldn't have minded.

But then, the day we went looking, at the very first place we stopped, they had one lone Pontiac Montana sitting in the lot. It was a 1999 - one year old - with about 14K miles on it. And it was marked a little below retail (as I quickly had a friend go online and blue book it).

We test drove it. Nice power, good handling, roomy, comfortable. 

To make a short story even shorter, we bought it that afternoon. 

Since then, we have driven it from St. Louis to New Mexico and back. We have hauled numerous families to Six Flags and the zoo. We have moved stuff back and forth from storage to home. And through it all, it has performed beautifully.

We love our Montana. People tell us what a good-looking minivan it is and we bask in the glow. It's a great vehicle for the money and I totally give the thumbs-up seal of approval.

However... (you knew that was coming, didn't you? I mean, no opinion could be complete without a reference to the imperfections marring all that exists around us.) However, there are a couple of things that have bugged me, and I just want to spell them out real quick-like:

- Molding came loose from doors (covered under warranty)
- Plastic sliding-door-track-holder-doohicky came loose (covered under warranty)
- Second cigarette-light (for use without having ashtray open) loose-fitting on standard plugs. Haven't checked on this yet.

However... (hah! I got you. You thought I was finished, didn't you, you wild and crazy people) However, there are also some neat features that apparently came standard on it as well. Here:

- won't let you turn on the lights if you have the parking brake on (useful at night)
- seats are <i>really</i> easy to take out
- the drink holders are pretty sturdy, much more so than any Buick I've seen. For some reason, Buicks just all seem to come with poorly designed cup-holders and for the life of me, I can't figure out why.

All in all, if you are looking for a good quality minivan at a reasonable price, the Montana will meet your needs and surpass your expectations.
