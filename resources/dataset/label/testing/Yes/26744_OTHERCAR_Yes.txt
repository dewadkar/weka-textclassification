            I bought this camera so I could take pictures of our new baby girl, and view them right away. And be able to send them out over email to our families. It more than satisfied my anticipations. This camera is very easy to use, and takes excellent pictures. Combined with the card reader the photos are on your computer in matter of seconds. The quality of the photos are very excellent! I would suggest to plan on buying rechargable batteries for it though because it does like to eat up batteries. Anyone who is considering a digital camera purchase should consider this camera. I really doubt that you will find anything better for under $300. It does not have a zoom, but I think for the money overall I am very pleased with my purchase and would suggest it to anyone seeking a digital camera purchase!<br><br>
