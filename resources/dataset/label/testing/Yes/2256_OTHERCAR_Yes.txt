            My husband and I recently bought a Certified Pre-owned 1996 Lexus LS 400.  The car looks exquisite and rides like a brand new car off the lot.  We bought this car for my husband's use but when I drove it for the first time, lookout.  There was no getting me out of the car.  It has a luxury feel and at times I thought the car was turned off because you couldn't hear a single car noise.  I also felt very safe in this car because of its size and easy handling.  I used to like the sporty look of the GS model but I've changed my mind.  The more I drive and look at this car, the more I see it as a classy car for everyone.  My carpool partner drives the ES 300 model and I find that the LS 400 is 3 steps above it.  It is definitely worth the additional investment.  This car feels like it will hold together and perform in any condition.  We're going to have it for a long time.  If you like sleek, classy, &quot;in control&quot;, well-engineered cars, this is the one for you.  Not only that, but the Lexus dealerships provide great customer service!<br><br>
