            Preface: I had an Early 02' that I reviewed, but that explorer has since been totaled. I am both of the explorer.
First Impression:
The paint was nice and glossy. Its called Mineral Grey, and it looked like it would hide dirt well. Also, I liked the Remote keypad being mounted up on the door. The one thing I did not like was the running boards, they appered they'd more trouble than they where worth. The interior was nicely done in a rich mixture of plastic, cloth and vinyl. The sound system belted out clear music. My other o2 was similar, but lacked the usless running boards (in exchange for more useful step bars) and was Toerador Red. 
Drive train:
I got this car used, with 12K. I had another 02 Explorer, but it met its demise. My first explorer was a V6 2wd. It got good gas mileage, around 18 in town and 24 on the high way. It had ample power and pleanty of reserve for those passing situations on the interstate. My Currant one has a V-8, which adds more power, but they both seem comperable on the interstate. Where the V-8 would come in handy: If you tow a-lot of stuff. What I do miss was the in town mileage. This one is 2wd, but it gets 16 around town with a light foot. It gets 23 with the crusie control on. The transsmisson shifts nicely and is not jerky. I just wish ford would have added a darn transsmisson dipstick. I think that its cheapness by ford.
Handling:
Both my explorers where 2wd and therefore handled about the same. My first one had Good Year Wrangler RT/S tires. My current one has Michilen Cross-Terrians. They help my second one do everthing a little better and are far better in rainy weather and as far as highway comfort go. Both do well on curvy mountain roads. My parents live in Western NC and I am not afraid to speed a little on some windy roads. Plus, they handle dirt roads better than my 99 Explorer does. I can easily pass some one @ 70 MPH and not have any form of a Tippy feeling. The braking is great. About 140 ft on wet pavement (this is just a rough guess)
Comfort:
I am glad that I was able to upgrade when my other was wrecked. My XLS Sport was nice, but it lacked some of the things my XLT has. Power seats help smaller drivers (like me) see over the wheel. The XLS did fine, but the XLT is much better. The radio in my XLS needed repair and was upgraded free by ford. The XLT has the same radio as the upgrade and it's quite nice. The factory speakers are good and deliver strong clear crisp sound. The A-C is very strong and copes well with those Hot Atlanta Summers. The sun roof is so fun. I missed it on my xls and would have had it added. It gives a more open airy feeling to the cabin. The third seat is also bigger than in comperable Mid-Size SUV's. Our Neigbors Trail Blazer EXT is lacking majorly here. My kids and ex wife and I all can travel 4-5 hours comfertably with no complaints. The trip we took in there trail blazer we had to stop and strech every two hours.
Reliabilty:
My XLS needed a Radio. My XLT has needed nothing more than Oil changes. I drove both to equal about 35,000 miles.

Overall these are wonderful vehicles and I would recommend them to any body.
