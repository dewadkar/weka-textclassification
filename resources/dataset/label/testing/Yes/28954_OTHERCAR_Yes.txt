            I didn't rent nor own this vehicle, but I have driven it for a considerable amount of time.....enough time to write an opinion about it. This car was bought off the lot used and had 27000 miles on it, now it has 103000 miles ...and it is ready to be traded in. It is currently owned and driven by a relative so I am writing the review after 2000-3000 miles of driving this car.

The Lumina Euro coupe is definately a looker. It has the alloy wheels and the sporty shape, and spoiler. It handles great and has pretty good pick up. A 3.1 liter 160 hp V6 pushes this car with plenty of pick up. There is plenty of seating up front for the passenger and driver. The rear seats are best used for cargo instead of passengers. This car is a bit thirsty for gas, but it is not a gas guzzler by any means.

The fun ends there since we have had problems in the past with this car. The starter, the Shocks/struts, the tires, the oxygen sensor, and other things. On the inside, the lever to open the hood broke off in my hand twice and has to be opened with pliars. 

I am sure there are other problems I don't know about. But this car is overall decent. It is outclassed and outperformed by other cars that are more reliable, but not my much. This car has decent looks and bang for the buck.
