            well, i am into the huge import scene and i wanted a car that was going to  be reliable enough to get me through college, fast, sporty, and cheap.  so me and my dad went down to the dealership and ordered up the top of the line civic, the si.  it is the best car i have ever had.  it comes standard with thing like a sunroof, cd player and 6 speaker sound system, 15&quot; alloy rims, leather steering wheel and shift knob, and best of all, the dohc 160hp vtec engine.  the car is only availabe in stick, by the way.  considering they dont make this car anymore, it would be an excellent steal if you could find a barely used one.  i have had mine for almost 15k miles so far, and have had no problems with it at all.  the suspension is good, the interior is holding up good, the engine has had no problems.  it is a typical honda, no worries.  i would reccomend this car to anyone that wants a reliable, sporty car. this car is mainly targeted towards kids who want to go racing, you don't see many older people driving these.  the car is a very comfortable car to drive, even at high speeds.  it doesn't shake when going fast, and is very controlable.  my only complaint on this car is the braking system.  the brakes always seen kind of weak.  like you gotta push down on the pedal a little more than usual to completely stop the car, but you get used to it.  overall, it is an excellent value.<br><br>
