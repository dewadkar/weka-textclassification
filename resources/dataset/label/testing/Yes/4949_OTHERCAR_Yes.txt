            It is easy to read the specs of the camera from the company website or even other reviews so I will skip that and go right into a review about USING the camera.

First, you must realize that this is a powerful camera that takes VERY good pictures.  This 4-megapixel camera takes pictures that look like a 4-megapixel camera should look.  Outdoor pictures are beautiful!  the camera seems to capture the richness of the colors.  We took it on our honeymoon in the carribean and it really captured the light blue of the water and the crispness of the landscape.

A big plus is just the size and shape of the camera.  It might not LOOK high tech or space age like some Sony's, but it is the most pratical by far.  Your fingers and hand actually have something to grip with this camera and it makes it easier to take pictures and you have more stability when you take pictures.  You can easily take pictures with one hand as well.  You might think that you will be careful and don't need an easy camera to hold, but you will appreciate this feature when the guy at Disneyland doesn't mess up your only chance to take a picture with Sleeping Beauty.

Another useful feature that works very well is the timer function.  Although the camera lacks a remote, the clear LCD makes it easy to frame a picture and the delay is plenty to get yourself in the shot.  The flash also blinks to indicate when the picture will be taken.  This might not be a big deal to some, but on a honeymoon on a secluded resort, it is a necessity unless you want a bunch of pictures of yourself or your spouse alone.

One drawback to the pictures, however, are the indoor photos.  Let me preface that it is possible that my indoor problem could be caused by using an incorrect setting.  I have tried taking various close-up pictures of things like a cake, my dog or a bed spread (don't ask).  Unfortunately, inside I had a difficult time capturing the color with this camera.  The flash tends to put too much light on the subject and thus make the pictures washed.  It is possible that I should be using a different setting, but I was using the automatic setting and to me, automatic means that you don't have to do much tweaking to make the picture come out well.

Although I haven't mastered the menu's for indoor pictures, I have had a lot of luck working with most of the settings.  The menus are very user friendly and simple.   I use mine with my iMac and as soon as I plug the camera into the computer, it reads it like a drive and I just drag and drop whatever pictures I want right onto the hard drive. 

Printing is easy, but I think that has more to do with my printer (a Cannon) than the camera, however I have had no problems on the camera side.

One more great thing about the camera is the rechargable battery that is included with the package.  I can usually get a full weekend out of one charge (that means taking 20-40 pictures with flashes AND looking at them over and over on the viewer).  I actually just throw the charger in my bad just in case I leave the camera on or spend too much time looking pictures because the LCD will drain the battery life faster than normal.

Two other negatives about this camera are the sound and the memory card.   First of all, if you want to take video, get a video camera.  This camera is not for people who want to take videos and then take a picture once in a while.  This is a photographer's camera.  I think that Nikon added the silent video function just for looks because so many competitors have this built in.  There really is not point in using a good digital camera for video nor is there a point to using a good video camera to take digital pictures.  Keep that in mind when you shop.   Also, the 16MB card is a joke... a nice camera like this needs at least a 64MB card but more like a 256MB card.  If you want to fully utilize this camera, you will want to take higher resolution pictures and therefore you will need the larger card.  

Overall, I am so SO happy with this camera.  We have stopped using film cameras and just print the good pictures, but those come out great.  If you are serious about your pictures, but not a total professional, this is a great camera!
