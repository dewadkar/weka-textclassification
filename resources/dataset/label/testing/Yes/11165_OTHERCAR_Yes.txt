            Back in 1998, I wanted a new vehicle.  I had lusted over the old suzuki samuri's but because of their safety issues and poor design, never purchased one.  I decided to get a RAV.  And I loved it.  It was a lease though, and when the lease came close to expiring, I started looking around.

I decided, first off, I wanted to stay with a small SUV.  I don't offroad, but I like having the ability to haul people and things when I need to do so.  I also like the fact that you sit higher off the road.  To me, I feel as if I have better control.

So I went web surfing.  I looked at Honda's, Nissan's, Subaru's among others.  In my initial search I had only two criteria -- air conditioning (I lived in the desert) and availability of a manual transmission.  I am one of those people who believes you never have the control with an automatic you do with a stick.  (My daughter agrees.)  I also looked at overall appearance, because I didn't want an ugly car.

I was more than a little shocked to see my selection narrowed down very quickly.  Honda was immediately out -- no manual available in the 2001 model.  The Subaru I found ugly, no offense to owners of it who like it.

It narrowed it down to the Nissan and the Toyota.  After much soul searching and looking around, I decided to get yet another RAV-4.  This one has a few more bells and whistles than my old one -- a 'moon roof', cd-player, that sorta stuff.  And it cost a wee bit more.

But I love it, my daughter loves it (when she steals it from me) and I would do it again.

Does it ride as smooth as a luxury car?  No, but then it isn't one.  Does it haul as much as a pick up truck?  No, but then it isn't one.  What it is for me and my family is the best 'little bit of everything' vehicle we have ever owned.

When this lease is up, I just might do it again.
