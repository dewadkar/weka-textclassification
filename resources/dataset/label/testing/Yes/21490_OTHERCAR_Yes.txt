            I should have died the day a little old lady changed her mind about a left turn and pulled back out in front of me on highway 29 in Vallejo, CA.  I was doing 65 when she clipped my rear end.  I fishtailed, spun 180 degrees, and slid backwards to a stop in the middle of an intersection.

I am 100% convinced that any other car would have flipped, killing me and a group of passengers I'm realy quite fond of.  Instead, this insanely well-engineered car hugged the road.  Noone was hurt, and we drove away.

A few thousand dollars of repairs later it handles like new.  If it had been too damaged to repair, I would have gone out and bought another one just like it.  This car saved my life.

Aside from that, I'm very happy with the roomy interior.  (I'm a big guy.)  I love the acceleration.  (I'm driving the GTP version with the super charger.)  And it looks nice, in a sporty but not too flashy for my age kind of way.

Cons?  Keyless entry only works after I get very close to the car, and the glove compartment door doesn't fit quite right - the light comes on sometimes.  Also, that 29 MPG highway is a fantasy, I've never done better than 25 and at four years old I'm settling into 20 or so.  And it needs 91 octane, which can be pricey.
