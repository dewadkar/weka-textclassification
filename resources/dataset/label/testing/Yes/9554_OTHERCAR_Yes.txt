            I've always been the type of person who drives the &quot;base model cheapie&quot; car to save money.  I'd worked in Toyota dealers and had had both the two wheel drive truck and a Corolla.  When I saw the new Celica GT (and didn't fall over in my tracks when I saw the sticker price,) I thought I might like this.  The test drive convinced me!  I have had the GT since January, and its performance (as most Toyota products) has been flawless.  True to form I bought the base model, which is almost a misnomer, because the standard features (5-speed manual transmission, 140 HP 1ZZFE engine, AM/FM/CD/cassette radio with 6 speaker output, intermittent wipers, rear wiper and air conditioning) are exactly the features most people would pay extra to add on.  

This car is a total rush to drive.  The combination of variable valve timing and a transaxle that is geared rather low allows the Celica to accelerate much faster than other cars with similar sized engines.  My previous vehicle was a 98 Corolla (same engine- 1ZZFE, but no variable valve timing and a different transaxle) and the Corolla did not accelerate nearly as well.

The handling characteristics are awesome too.  This car has full independent suspension, so it corners exceedingly well, even at high speeds.

Fuel economy is another advantage to the Celica- 35 MPG mixed city and highway, 41 MPG, strictly highway.  These are my actual averages, however, my GT is the 5-speed, and I tend to drive conservatively most of the time.

The only drawbacks I can see with the Celica are that tall people may have a hard time getting in and out, and I certainly would not want to have to manage a car seat in this car.  Since I'm 5'4'' and my child is way too old for car seats, these are not issues for me.

Overall, Toyota has outdone themselves on this one.  I thoroughly enjoy everything about this car, and I can enjoy myself without feeling guilty, because this car hasn't cost me any more than the &quot;economy cars&quot; I'm accustomed to.<br><br>
