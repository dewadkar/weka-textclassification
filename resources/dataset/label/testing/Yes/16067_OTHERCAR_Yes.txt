            One week ago I purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited. While the car was a bit pricey, (I paid $36000), It is certainly a great car to drive.

The Grand Cherokee is extremely comfortable. You will first notice the tremendous comfort once you sink into the leather, heated, handsewn seats. You won't want to get up. The Jeep also provides plenty of legroom, making the Grand Cherokee perfect for long trips. As the driver, you will notice other little features which will make the driving experience much more comfortable. For one, the steering will is wrapped with leather which is also handsewn. This provides a very luxurious, comfortable grip. The steering wheel is also equipped with controls for the radio which makes driving a lot more fun and easy. The driver is also provided plenty of onboard displays to notify you of any problems that might occur (and rarely do occur). The Limited is equipped with climate control, (unlike the other models), which is perfect for finding your ideal comfort zone. Another neat feature is the ability for two separate drivers to customize their car at the click of a button. The remote entry system allows two drivers to have their own radio presets and mirror and seat configurations. The car recognizes your keyless entry and adjusts to fit your preferences. This makes life a lot easier when you're not the only one using the car. The most comfortable part of this car is the smooth ride that it offers. The smooth ride easily compares to many luxury sedans I have driven in. 

The Jeep is equipped with all-time four wheel drive. This makes driving in rugged conditions much easier. The Limited comes with a V8 engine, making the Grand Cherokee a very powerful car. Surprising, with the all-time four wheel drive, the mileage is still good. I've averaged about 15 mpg thus far. 

I definitely recommend this car to anyone interested in purchasing an automobile. With the Grand Cherokee Limited, I assure you you won't be disappointed.<br><br>
