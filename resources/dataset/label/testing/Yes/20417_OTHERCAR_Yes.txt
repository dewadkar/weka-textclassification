            I have the 2000 Jetta and I absolutely love it!  I test drove several cars, but I wasn't very impressed by most of them.  The last car I test drove was the Jetta, and I knew instantly that it fit me like a glove.  It grips the road well, handles well, and feels solid.  No corners were cut with this car, and even though I bought the entry level Gl, I don't feel like the car is chintzy in any way.  The body lines are sleek and beautiful.  

I find myself going on pointless drives, just because I want to be in my new car!  It's best viewed at night, because the dash display is so pretty.  The lights on the display are a cornflower blue, and the action indicators are bright red.  The headlights focus the light well, and include everything, even the fog lights, all in one.  They even help you to see things on the side of the road well, because they are so bright.  I never realized how many deer were lurking near my house before this car's headlights showed me!

My only complaint is the rear seats are really a pain to fold down.  You have to remove the headrests first, then fold them down to the floor.  It's really weird.

Other than that, this is a beautiful car, which is well built, well designed, and well worth the money!<br><br>
