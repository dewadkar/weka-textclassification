            I purchased this vehicle when it was just 2 months shy of 4 years old. This vehicle was purchased used under the &quot;Audi Assured&quot; program, which extends the original 3 year/50,000 mile warranty to 5 years/75,000 miles (bumper to bumper). So far, I am very happy with the warranty and the service.

This car came to me in flawless condition... Like a new car, despite having about 50,000 miles on it. Because the vehicle was maintained regularly at the local Audi dealership during the entire original warranty period, it was eligible for the &quot;Audi Assured&quot; program. If you're going to purchase a used Audi, you can gain considerable peace of mind by purchasing from a dealer who is offering this warranty program!

EXTERIOR: The car is definitely a wonder of engineering -- all parts move smoothly and fit together with utter perfection. The paint is thick and smooth, sheet metal is very solid, and both hood and trunk lid have smooth hydraulic operation.

INTERIOR: The interior is rich and once again the parts and panels all fit absolutely perfectly. Lots of rich wood and thick, supple leather. The dual memory seats are great; the driver's seat can be programmed to both keyless remotes -- a great feature since my wife is significantly shorter than I am... I simply use the remote, and the seat automatically moves to my settings before I even sit down. I wasn't sure about the red dash lighting at first, but it quickly grew on me and now I'm quite partial to it. The Bose am/fm/cassette/cd stereo sounds very rich... The cd changer is in the trunk, which I find somewhat inconvenient, but the Bose speakers sound so good that I'll forgive Audi for not putting the CD player in the dash.

ENGINE/TRANSMISSION: The 2.8 L V-6 offers very adequate power, though enthusiasts often pine for a larger engine (Audi has since redesigned the A6 and added two new engines with more power - a 2.7 L V6 Turbo and a 4.2 L V-8). The automatic transmission could be a bit smoother, but I'm not at all unhappy with it.

Overall, the ride is very smooth and the Quattro all-wheel-drive system makes the car feel very much glued to the road. There is a little wind noise that I haven't been able to track down; it spoils an otherwise completely silent ride and I'm hoping to track it down and correct it if possible. The level of comfort, however, is very high and I love the dual heated leather seats... I could spend all day in this car!

The experience of driving a 1996 Audi A6 is one of comfort, roominess, above-average performance, and definitely a significant measure of luxury and prestige. The A6 offers more for significantly less money when compared with the same model year Mercedes C-280 and the BMW 528.

If you're looking for excellent value in a used, mid-sized luxury sedan, the A6 is an excellent choice. If you also want all-wheel drive in this class and price range, the A6 is your only choice.<br><br>
