            This is my personal favorite truck on the market, and this is coming from a guy who knows trucks.  It is a nice large truck without being as awkward as the F350.  It fits into a standard sized garage but is far from standard.  It has higher torque than the competition so that you can be towing anything from a sheet of plywood for a Sunday house repair to a load to a construction site and not be able to tell the difference.  Also I think it looks nicer than the dodge or chevy models, making it nice for just a flashy ride around town.  It comes at a true value when considering the versatility this mammoth piece of truck has.  If you are looking for a truck for any reason at all whether it's for a ride around town or a vehicle to pull a work load in style this is the truck for you<br><br>
