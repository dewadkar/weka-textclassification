            I bought the 96 gas hummer (red, open top, 4 door) when i first moved to california.  I used to own a jeep wrangler on the east coast and figured bigger state = bigger truck.  i had no idea what i was getting into.

For two years the hummer served as my only vehicle.  i used it to commute approx. 25 minutes each way to work every day in the silicon valley.  on the weekends, i drove up to the sierra's and explored the rugged mountain trails thoroughly, often climbing huge 4 foot boulders, traversing 3-4 feet of water, winching my way out of mud, and generally doing what all good hummer owners should do.  I pushed the limits of what any offroad vehicle should legally be allowed to do and never found something it couldn't deal with (I even had this 3 ton thing airborne!).  Overall, i had a blast with it and put a vast array of impressive scratches and gouges in it's armor.

But while the hummer is a truly awesome off road vehicle, it sucks for commuting and is strictly for the true off road diehard. while the ride is suprisingly comfortable (except for the incredibly high decibel levels), the gas guzzling nature of this truck is nothing short of astonishing.  not only was the constant refueling expensive (i refueled the hummer's 20ish gallon tank every two days or so just for commuting!), i started feeling really guilty about the huge impact i was having on our natural resources and half expected to see demonstrators on my front lawn.

another really annoying part of driving a hummer is that *everyone*, that's right, *everyone* looks at you while you're driving.  it's eerie.  and when you stop to get gas, be ready to field all the usual questions (how much did you pay?  do the tires really inflate automatically?  what's the gas mileage?  ever think of mounting a rocket launcher on it? etc.)  if you're attention starved, the hummer is just the truck for you.  for me, this became the most annoying part of owning the truck.

still, i'm a huge fan of the hummer's engineering simplicity and rawness.  it's well worth the hassle and expense if you like to drive in truly insane conditions and have another car for your mere mortal activities.
