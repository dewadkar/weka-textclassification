            The Jaguar S-type is a beautiful car. It has great steering and breaking controls and is a joy to drive. The front seats all have Lombard support, which feels wonderful on your back. The safety features are also outstanding. The car is built well and it very heavy, that it can withstand many collisions. I once got rear-ended in mine, and drove away without a scratch, while the other car had thousands of dollars of damage. The ride is also very smooth and comfortable. Most bumps in the road can't even be felt while driving this car.
The only con in the Jaguar S-type is the roominess n the back. My brother is about five feet ten inches, and complains that his legs don't have enough room, and the sloping roof bothers his head. I would not recommend this car to a big family, the back seat can fit three children, and even that it crowded. 
The Jaguar S-type also has a lot of extra features: Like the climate control, which lets the passenger seat have different AC and heat controls then the driver. You may also have a reverse sensor, which beeps if you get too close to an object when backing up, this is very helpful with new drivers, such as myself.
In conclusion, the Jaguar S-type is a beautiful car and I would recommend it to many.
