            If any of you have ever read my epinions before you know that we rent quite afew cars, and among them have been the 2000 Chrysler Sebring Convertible.  I am person who needs comfort for long trips, and the Sebring has it.  After comfort I would have to say that this car has the power needed to pass even in the mountains; we live in an area that can start at 500' feet elevation and top out at 8500'. Not once did either of the Sebrings that I rented hesitate when climbing or having to pass a slow truck in the mountain roads we traveled.  And it didn't matter whether you were on the straight away or taking a hard turn the wheel responded very well and this is what won me over along with the excellent gas mileage it got.

There was nothing cheap about the making of this car, from the outside it looked sharp and commanded attention where ever it appeared.  The interior for the driver was right where you would want everything to be; within easy reach.  I had some fairly large passengers in the back seat and they thought the ride was excellent along with the leg room that they required, even after 160 miles of traveling.  And there was plenty of room to put an ice chest and our luggage in the trunk.

I will add that any car needs maintained, it's a very important factor, the first car we rented only had 700 miles on it, and they last one we rented had over 42,000 on it and needed some attention; tires, tune-up as any car would, but it still responded well where ever we took it, but it used a little more gas.  I probably won't ever be able to purchase one of these fine cars, but it would be my first choice if I could.
