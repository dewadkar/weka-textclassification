            I just purchased a 2001 Dodge Dakota Club Cab SLT 4X4 Pick up. Its a Mid size truck, and being a 4X4 its very easy to get in and out of. I ordered my truck and got a very nicely equipped vehicle for $24,750. That does not include the incentives. I paid $23,250 after incentives.

When ordering you must thoroughly understand the different option packages. Trying to purchase on option alone may be available in an option package at a better price and value. The Model I purchased came available in two tone paint. I got Deep Garnet Red over Silver Metallic, its hot! 

The cloth interior does not feel as sturdy as the cloth interior my 98 Dakota Sport had. I wish Dodge would have daytime running lights on their trucks.

The Dakota has a 6 foot bed, which is ideal for the average person. Actually I only filled the bed of my 98 Dakota once. The 2001 drives and Handles very nicely. The interior is roomy and comfortable. The Stereo sound system is great. I have an AM/FM/Cassette/CD Player with 8 Infinity speakers.

This is my second Dodge Dakota truck, so obviously Dodge is doing it right. I have no complaints about the quality and performance of the 2001 Dakota
