<TEXT>
            I have a 1990 240 Wagon with 97K miles.  I actually like the design of the 240 better than the new Volvo Wagons.  My 1990 is almost identical to my brother's 1982 Wagon, which has over 200K.  The main problem that everyone I know who has a Volvo is with the air conditioning -- and it can cost well over a $1,000 to fix it up.  On the other hand, if I can put 200K on mine, then it'll be worth it!<br>
