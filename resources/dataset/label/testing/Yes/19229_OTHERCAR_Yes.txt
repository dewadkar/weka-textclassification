            I bought the Minolta Dimage 2300 almost a year ago for a couple of reasons. First, it is an excellent collection of quality hardware with many features for the price. Second, it is small and lightweight.

After several months of usage, I can say that the Dimage 2300, with its 2.3 megapixel resolution, is capable of producing very high quality digital photos. I have even had some of these photos printed professionally with film-like results.

However, this camera is not without drawbacks. The biggest problem I have had is that it only produces bright pictures in open daylight. This is not a good camera for indoor use. Sometimes even when using the flash in well lit rooms, pictures still turn out dark. Another problem is that, without buying additional flash memory, it is only possible to take ONE uncompressed photo. The supplied memory can take over 40 highly compressed images, but the higher the compression the more the image degrades. If you are planning on printing a digital picture with high quality as you would with a film camera, you need to use no compression and you will only have one chance to get it right because that is all the camera can hold. The last problem is that the Dimage 2300 drains batteries at an alarming rate. It does come with rechargable batteries (thank goodness), but I have drained them in less than an hour many times and it takes about 12 hours to charge them again. If you plan on taking many pictures or using the display screen, you had better have additional batteries with you.
