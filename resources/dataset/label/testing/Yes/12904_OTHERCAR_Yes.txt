            My Dad has a Volvo and let me tell you, he absolutely loves it and so do I.  I personally think they are beautiful cars, and they are one of the safest cars around.  Some may be a little expensive so my advice would be to by one used. My father bought his when it was two years old and he paid about half of what he would pay if it was brand new.  I consider the car to be a luxury, and they come with so many features- heated seats, delux sound systems, driver and passenger temperature control, winter traction control, sunroof that opens two ways, and many others.  I think they ride absolutely wonderful, and I've never been in a more comfortable car.  They are very roomy, and very safe.<br><br>
