            For those of you who may not know, The '92 Bonneville was a brand new style and design.  There are always troubles with a brand-new design and my '92 was no exception.  I had electrical failures such as 3 out of 4 of the power windows failing.  I also had trouble with the ABS computer showing a failure when the brakes actually worked just fine.  (The rear drum breaks did fail after 40,000 miles.  The alternator lasted 43,000 miles before it failed and the air conditioner lasted 6 years before it failed.  
On the other hand, the engine has performed flawlessly for 111,000 miles now and is still not burning oil.  The car still gets about 25 MPG on the road and 18 in mixed city/highway driving.
Many of the interior plastic pieces have broken over the 8 years since I got the car.  They include the power window buttons, cigarette lighter, and vent controls.  The back seat vent control is easy to break because it is near where the kid's feet would be.      <br><br>
