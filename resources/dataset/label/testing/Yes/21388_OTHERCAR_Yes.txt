              The Toyota Camry delivers on it's promise to be a reliable family car in every sense.  Even the 132 horsepower 2.2 liter four cylinder has the zip to power the 3000 plus pound car up to speed when accessing the expressway or even when passing that truck up ahead.  The four speed electronic transmission shifts are silky with no hesitation or jerky effects.  Gas mileage is 30 highway and around town expect about 23 miles per gallon.  Road sound is almost non-existent with very good sound deadening.  The interior appointments are plain yet clean, this is a no nonsense car for the long run.
  Our Camry was not perfect, the dealer wound up replacing the automatic transmission the second time the check engine light came on at 3000 miles.  The difference was in the dealers support, we got another new Camry to drive totally free of charge and profuse apologies from the dealer for the inconvenience.  Toyota knows how to keep a customer, something that can not be said for some other brands I know of.
  A summary statement for the Camry is that it is worth the extra cost, and will deliver over the long haul what you expect from a very competent piece of transportation.<br><br>
