            After my husband received a large promotion, we decided it was time for a larger more luxurious car. We went in with our own loan to not have to deal with dealer financing.

We look at the Dodge Intrepid but left after the dealer was very rude. It was raining out and we do not think he wanted to deal with it then. Then we looked at the Chevy Malibu and we thought it was okay but the dealer just was not willing to move on the price. 

Well we ended up at the Mazda dealer after a call back on a used car and the dealer offered us a better deal on one of their new Mazda 626�s. We took one out for a test drive and really liked it. The base model 626 we looked at came loaded with options. We have a CD player, power windows, power locks, cruise control, tilt steering, and A/C. We really wanted a stick but they had none in stock so we settled for an automatic. Now we have a feature that we thought was funny at first but it is great. The middle front vents oscillate left and right. It is nice in hot weather with the A/C on.

This car has great power. Way more then it needs. I am sure the V-6 model of the 626 is very fast and powerful since this one is. The gas mileage is good considering this car is so heavy. We do almost all city driving and we get about 25 mpg. 

This car looks very sporty but it still works great for a family. Car seats fit nicely in the backseat of the car. I have ridden in the back seat of this car for a few long trips and I find there is plenty of room. I am 5�7� and consider myself about average height.

The trunk size works out very well for us. The one thing that is not very good is that the rear folds down seats are not really helpful. There is a large metal bar right behind them and it does not really offer much more room for the trunk when they are down.

We have had one problem with this car that the dealer was very quick to resolve. I noticed a leak coming from the bottom of the engine and was horrified by it due to the past problems with the Mazda transmission. I took the car in and it was just that there was a bad gasket on the oil pan. The dealer replaced the gasket and changed my oil free of charge.

We are about to drive form Alabama to New York and we will see how well his car performs in the 1200 miles.
