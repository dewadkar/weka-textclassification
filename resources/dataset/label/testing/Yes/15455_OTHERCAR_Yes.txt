            After looking at a multitude of digital cameras and spending hours trying them out in the stores (much to the displeasure of a few sales people) we picked this one out. We chose it for several reasons:
*Ease of use - I figured this one out without the instruction book!
*Storage - This camera uses floppy disks, great for instant sharing and usable on any computer, no reader needed. Also, no memory cards to buy.
*Sharing pics anywhere - the camera lets you make copies of disks, no computer needed.
*LCD screen - It has a large bright LCD screen.
*Battery life - It lasts a couple of hours with it's battery.
The pictures I have taken have turned out crystal clear and the macro setting allows you to get close enough and clear enough to see individual pollen grains in a flower in the picture. The movie mode that allows you to take 60 seconds of video with sound is great for sending through e mail. I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone!
