               I think that my opinion should be valued because I have had three Honda Civics and have loved each one. I have had a '95, '97, and currently a '99, and with each one, I have more than pleased. With my keyless entry and the original Honda CD player, I could stay on the road for hours, and believe me, I sometimes do!! I get compliments on my car all the time, and I agree with each one. I lease cars, so my lease will run up in a couple of years, but i will definitely have a hard time parting with my cute little silver Civic. The only think that makes me happy is looking forward to my next little wonder!!<br><br>
