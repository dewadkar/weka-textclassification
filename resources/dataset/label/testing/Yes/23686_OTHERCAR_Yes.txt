            We had a used 1995 Chevy Blazer for almost three years, and while it was a pretty good vehicle, it was starting to fall apart.  We also have a 1991 Acura Integra GS hatchback, that is primarily my car.  I have had it for around 6 years, and like it very much!  These are the vehicles I will be comparing the PT Cruiser to.

We bought a 2002 Steel Blue PT Cruiser Limited Edition.  I have not made any modifications to it.

The primary use for the car in my case is for a family car.  My wife really liked the room and height of the Blazer we had, and it had to be a 4-door since we have a child.  I wanted something that handled and felt like a car, but she wanted something similar to an SUV.  The PT Cruiser was the best of both worlds for us.

The styling is something you either like, or you don't like.  We happened to like it, of course.  Be prepared for to hear comments from friends or family that don't like it.  We have had a few family members and friends say, "I think those things are ugly."  Well, that's their opinion!  You should be buying it for you, not for them!

It is relatively quiet on road trips, gets pretty good gas mileage, and is fairly peppy.  It's not a race car, sports car, or truck and does not have that kind of power.  It does have plenty of driving power though.  With a fully loaded car (4 healthy adults and one toddler, large full ice chest and other misc items), I went 70-75mph on a two hour trip and the Cruiser didn't give me any problems and I still got decent gas mileage.

My in-laws live in Northern Alabama (250 miles one way), and we usually go there at least once a month.  We have had the Cruiser for about 5 months now, and have 11,000 miles on it.  We have had no problems as of yet.  All of our stuff usually fits very easy in the car.  It is a joy to drive on these trips.

The only negative things I can think of, are the single cup holder in the rear, and the fact that are no map lights for the rear passengers.

I can't think of much else to say, except that I really like it.  The next one will probably be a manual tranmission, just because it would be my car and my wife wouldn't need to drive it.  If you like the styling, like suv type space, and the way a car drives, then this would be a good car to consider.  If you want to smoke Mustangs and Camaros or want to pull something large (boat/camper/horse trailer) you need to look at something else.
