            I had no thoughts about buying one of these until I saw a 45 mph head on collision an owner of one had with a Honda Accord right in front of me.  Both people in the Accord didn't survive.  The Sable was smashed flat across the front.  Except for burns from the airbag and a bruise from the seat belt he was fine!  I drove him home!   With 3 children safety is my prime concern.  

I guess it's no Lexus or Park Avenue but for good cheap and safe transportation it can't be beat.  A lot of people don't like this car so ones 3 years old go for $6,000 at dealer auctions (Get a dealer to get you in and save 25%!).  Even at double this price they are a good buy!   I guess if the &quot;Millionaire Next Door&quot; (as in the book by the same name) were to have a &quot;Best Buy&quot;  this would be it!  

I bought mine with 22,000 miles.  It had been a rental.  I put 90,000 more on it.  The only problems I have had were the dome light problem others have mentioned that stays on (The dealer sprayed it with lubricant and it is fine) and routine brakes and tires (Needed $700 calipers at 90,000 miles).  Now I have a oil leak (3.0 standard engine) that I need to find.  

The ride is a little choppy but the steering is much better than the Camry (too lose) and the 10+ others I test drove.  At highway speeds it's great.  It handles confidently.  The car, the sound system and controls are better than Consumer Reports said they would be.  The car is quiet and is a pleasure to drive.  

We allow 130,000 pound coal trucks to ruin our coal area roads in Kentucky so the front end has seen it's share of abuse.  I have never had the broken tie rod problems I have had with even the Japanese cars I have owned.  I am religious about changing the transmission fluid and not getting too close to other cars and riding the brakes so these things last me longer than most people.  

Dealers are giving these away now.  They are great bargain!  Look for oil or fluid leakage around heads (If you don't know what heads are ask your salesperson).  Climb under the car (I know!  But it is worth it!) and see if there are wet shiny spots.  Pull the transmission dip stick out (yellow top behind engine) and smell the fluid on it. Does it have a burnt smell?  Make sure it looks pink.  If it is brown and looks like cheap canned gravy it either hasn't been changed in a long time or the transmission is bad. Don't buy this one.

Look for receipts in the glove box.  Has the oil and transmission fluid been changed in a while?  If less than 35,000 miles are the tires (Generals) still on the car?  If so they should be 1/3rd tread if the car was driven right.  Looks for window gaskets not matching up.  It is a real problem with this model when they have been wrecked. If they don't and you get out on the highway at 75 mph you will hear a howl.  I test drove 2 like this.  

Try one you'll love it!
