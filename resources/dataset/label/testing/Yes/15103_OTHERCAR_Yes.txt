            My 1999 Altima is a beauty. 
As usual, I paid more than I should, 
but I never learned to dicker.
Still, it's compact, has 4 doors
looks nice and... saved my life.
I was in an accident in November,
Got myself broadsided by a SEMI
The doors on the driver side were hit
squarely at maybe 30mph.
Since it was a side hit, the air bag
did not inflate, however I'm told
that it doesn't unless you're hit head-on.
Still I WAS NOT INJURED!
Well, ok, my back and neck were sore
for awhile.
But nothing broken, the car is very
solid!  I will probably stay with
this make of car for a long time!
