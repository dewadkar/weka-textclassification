            I bought my 2000 Pontiac Sunfire in July 2001.  Since then, it's been a very reliable mode of transportation for me, with absolutely no major hassles.  It's gotten great gas mileage (I drove from PA to MA on less than one tank of gas) and seats five adults.  The factory sound is much better than what normally comes with cars.  I also love the five cupholders and the armrest/storage area.

My Sunfire is also very good-looking.  I have the sedan, which boasts a very sporty spoiler and ribbing along the sides.  I'm also a big fan of the rounded parking lights and turn signals.

Oh, and the rear seat folds down so that oversize items in the trunk (skis, assemble-it-yourself furniture) can come with you.

There really isn't much NOT to like about this car.  The seats get uncomfortable after a few hours driving continuously, it stalled on me after some seriously heavy rain (but no problems after that, so it was probably because the car was sitting in its space for three days while torrential rains doused it) and you can really feel the engine working when you're going uphill, but it's still an awesome car.  It's my first car, so I highly recommend it as a first car for anyone.
