            The Suzuki Swift is the perfect car for a single person.  Comfortable and easy to drive, it performs well in snow and rain.  It seats 4 average size people comfortably and the gas mileage it gets is out of this world.  I average 30mpg in town.  It has a small cargo area behind the rear seat that is accessible from the hatchback or inside the car.  By laying the backseat down you get enough room to carry a decent amount of cargo but the drawback is you lose seats for 2 people.  I've driven this car for over a year now with only the usual maintenance and no problems whatsoever. I absolutely love it!<br><br>
