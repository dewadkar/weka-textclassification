            The Isuzu Trooper is a combination of comfort, reliability and steadfast engineering. My new Trooper is the second Trooper I have owned. There are three main reasons I have come back to the Trooper. To begin with, Isuzu ONLY manufactures SUV's. They left the car business a few year's ago. Secondly, the Trooper has a solid maintenance record for reliability. I had a 1988 Trooper for several years and provided the regular maintenance on the SUV and RARELY had any mechanical problems. The last and final reason I bought my new Trooper was due to the &quot;Torque on Demand&quot; 4-wheel drive system that Isuzu had finally perfected. The &quot;Torque on Demand&quot; is a computer system that provides traction and power to wheels that need it the most. This system is VERY effective in snowy and muddy conditions. 
Also the &quot;luxury&quot; package bears a second look. I am VERY pleased with the leather heated seats, power everything, and the six player CD audio system. The Tooper has a few downsides. For the price the 3.5L engine feels a bit under powered in the mountains. A big V-8 would improve the climbing power of this vehicle. Like most SUVs the gas mileage is around 15 MPH on the highway. When you think about however, you would never buy an SUV for the great gas mileage. All in all, I found this SUV to be a GREAT value.<br><br>
