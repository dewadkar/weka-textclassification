            My mother bought this car some time ago and she loves it.  I was allowed a test drive and found it to be very sensitive to steering and brakes, but aside from that, the car was great.  

The interior of the car is what surprised me.  The backseat leg space is very large compared to other cars.  I have long legs and always have trouble riding in back (always ride shotgun) but not in this car.  With the driver side seat 1 notch from the farthest positiion back, I was able to sit with ease in the back seat.  Also the driver seat required no adjustment when I went to drive it.  My mother is a good foot or so shorter than I am, and there was still plenty of room for me to drive comfortably at her seat position.

I was extremely suprised at the amount of trunk space this car has.  It has plenty of room for a good twin 12" speaker box, and a lot left over if that was installed.

The many bells and whistles this car has is great.  The guys who designed this car thought of everything.  The engine has excellent get up and go power, coupled with killer handling.  

I would highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a comfortable, powerful car at a great price.
