            Like a Rock is not just an advertising gimmick. I own a 96 Tahoe with 85000 miles and it drives like it just rolled out of the showroom.  I have taken it off-road, on long hi-way trips, into mountain snowstorms on ski trips and back and forth to work.  I get roughly 18 miles to the gallon, even when towing the boat.  It is extremely comfortable and roomy, as I use it a lot for golf trips with 3 other guys with clubs and coolers.  The stereo works great and the cd player has NEVER skipped, not even whole off-road.  The Tahoe is tough on brakes, due to the weight, I have replaced my front pads twice and the discs once, other than that and tires, it has required nothing other than routine maintenance.  I would  buy another one.<br><br>
