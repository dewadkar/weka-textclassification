            I own a completely bottom of the line Tacoma. 2WD, manual, short cab, short bed, bench seat. My relationship with the truck is a love/hate one.

I love that it'll never die, that it'll always be there for me, that it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. I put a lot of miles on my vehicles, and the Tacoma has not had a single bit of a problem in the 65k miles I've put on it. I LOVE that it has a timing chain instead of a timing belt. That means no $500 service every 60k miles. No snapped timing belt causing a seized engine. That's a good thing.

I hate that it's 2WD. If you've ever driven a rear wheel drive pickup in slippery conditions with no load in the back, you know what I'm talking about. And I don't mean just snow and ice. I'm talking rain, slippery new roads, oil slicks, anything. It's a matter of physics, really. Any rear wheel drive vechicle with a 90% front weight distribution is bound to fishtail in non-ideal conditions.

The bench seat is horrible. More than a 1.5 hour drive and my legs start to go numb.

The transmission is weird. I don't think the target market for $12,000, bare bones, japanese trucks is the type of market that hauls around huge loads or tows a lot. In fact, the cargo and towing capacities of the Tacoma ensure that. Yet the transmission is very obviously geared towards hauling. First gear gets you up to about 10 mph, second goes to about 25. You're in fourth and fifth for even most city driving. If you don't mind shifting 12 million times an hour, this is not a big deal. I mind.

But when it really comes down to it, I love my truck. After I put in a good stereo, everything was fine. It's not like I didn't expect any of the so-called problems above. I'd just like a better car. But who wouldn't? The Tacoma does what I need, and it'll last 'til rapture. I'd buy another one. A better model with bucket seats and 4WD, but I'd definitely get another Tacoma.
