            In 98, we needed to replace our sedan due to an accident.  We looked at the mini vans available and were very displeased with the cramped conditions.  With four children playing soccer, we needed something to get to games in comfort, to picnic in, and to travel to tournaments.

We found a new Glaval E-150 Econoline conversion on the lot at our Ford dealer and have but 2 complaints.  Our running boards are likewise cracking and we do use them, I weigh in at a svelte 205 and they seem to have been designed more for looks than the everyday use we give them.  My second complaint is a minor leak in the left panel window (it seems to be confined to the track, there's never been wet fabric in the rain.  I also find the foot room in the cockpit a bit restrictive. 

The handling and suspension are more than we expected.  High crosswinds buffet the van, but otherwise tracks true.  With 35,000 miles on the clock, the motor and transmission work flawlessly.  We've performed routine maintenance (oil, filters, tire rotation and alignment) but have yet to visit any shop for repairs, warranty or otherwise.  We took a trip this summer to Oklahoma from California and back with many side trips (4000+ miles) and would never have made it without this van.  The air kept everyone comfortable, even through the deserts of California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico - most of the time the kids had blankets on their laps to keep comfortable.  With our children, the TV/VCR was a blessing - though I threatened to throw "Grease" out the window if played again after listening to the kids watching it 5 or 6 times!  Thus far, the interior fabrics and fit have showed no noticeable signs of wear.  Available storage behind the bench seat was ample for all our needs and souvenirs picked up on the trip.  

Though too large for the garage (our model is the high top with TV/VCR overhead)its size and rear standing room are the reason we purchased this van.  Great for vacations, road trips, weekend activities and short daily commutes.  Though I do feel a bit pampered and self conscious when driving alone with all the empty seats.

Would I do it again?  In a heart beat.  Whether driving for 10 minutes or 10 hours on the open road, this van conversion is comfortable for me and for my family.  We got more than we expected at a fair price.

November 2001 - We've now driven 50,000 miles with this van and are as pleased as when we bought it.  I would caution others to check brake wear frequently; the brakes wore out at 45,000 miles and required rotor replacement ($500) due to metal-to-metal wear, (what happened to noise wear indicators?).  The weight of the van probably contributed to premature wear, my F150 went 110,000 miles before I replaced the brakes and even then the mechanic said there was at least 15-20k miles remaining!  

The van, otherwise, has required no other maintenance or repair work (other than oil changes).
