            Here�s an option for Wrangler tops you probably haven�t heard or thought of if you�re considering the dual top option:  buy your Jeep with a soft top, then buy an after market hard top.  The dual top option that is available for Wranglers is an excellent choice if you want the convenience of a soft top on those summer days when you�re caught miles from home in a thunderstorm.  But in the winter or during long periods of rain, you can put the hard top on and feel like you�ve got some solid protection.

Buying a hard top from an after market company (e.g., JC Whitney, ProPerformance, etc.) is a better value because of the superior quality in construction.  The after market hard tops are usually stronger and more durable than the thin top that comes with the Wrangler.  They are typically fabric-lined which helps reduce exterior noise and helps insulate the interior.

Some points to consider in support of having both hard and soft tops:

Soft Top-

- Substantially more road noise, especially when the top �whips� in the wind
- Greater potential for drafts or leaks
- Much greater risk of theft or vandalism
- Deteriorates much more quickly than a hard top, especially if subjected to year-round exposure to the elements
- Convenience of riding with the top down while being able to take the top with you in case of rain
- Easily taken on and off by one person

Hard Top-

- Taking top on and off requires two people or purchase of a garage hoist
- Top requires six bolts and can be time consuming to remove (by the way, take one of the bolts to a hardware store and look where you�d find socket wrenches.  You�ll find the same tool $10-$15 less than at the dealer.  You can also buy a couple adapters and put it on a power screwdriver�probably cuts the time by about 2/3, especially since those tight spaces are tough to get to with a socket wrench.)
- Easy to get caught in a summer thunderstorm since you can�t go topless and take it with you
- Inconvenient on those spring and fall days when it�s very cold in the mornings and evenings, but warm during the day
- Need to have somewhere to store the top when it�s off
- Greatly reduces road noise
- Makes it just as difficult to break into as a car
- Reduced risk of wind or rain leaks
- Rear dome light, rear-window wiper, and rear defroster

If you decide to go for the soft top only, you should still consider getting full steel doors.  You�ll get real windows that provide greater visibility, added protection, and convenience.  With half doors, you�ll find yourself at fast food drive-throughs and toll booths having to unzip your plastic window and flip it outside�a real pain on cold or rainy days.  By the way, if you like the �doors off� look, the full doors come off the same way the half doors do (don�t forget to buy some forward-mounted side-view mirrors to be legal; the stock mirrors come off with the doors).

Happy Jeeping!
