            In 1990 I bought a brand new Ford Ranger Supercab. I bought a Ford because I had previously owned Ford trucks and had always been satisfied with them. I bought a supercap because I had 2 small children at the time and the jump seats in the extended cab area were perfect for them. The truck was big enough to hold the whole family and at the same time it was very economical. I did have some initial breaking in problems with the truck but once all the bugs were worked out of it it was great. Even though this was a small vehilce it drove much like a full size truck and was extremely comfortable. I would recomend that anyone with small children or no children to buy a Ford Ranger. I kept mine until 1998 and it had 135 thousand miles when i sold it. I would not recomend this truck to families with more than 2 small kids.<br><br>
