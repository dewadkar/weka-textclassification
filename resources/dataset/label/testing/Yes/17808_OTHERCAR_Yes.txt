            My wife purchased her pearl white 1996 240SX SE in 1997 after test driving the Acura Integra, Honda Accord coupe, and Honda Civic. She chose mainly because of the svelte exterior. The clear-coat paint today shines better than the new 2001 4-door Civic we just bought.
 
Nissan made these sports cars from 1995-1998. The '95 &amp; '96 models had front air dams with fog lights. The '97 &amp; '98 models deleted the air dams and fog-lights because they were too close to the ground. Mechanicals and interiors were the same. The 155-hp 4-cylinder engine has plenty of torque to spin out the rear wheels if you have a heavy foot. After market exhaust and turbo kits are available to boost the horsepower to well above 200 if that's your cup of tea. The suspension and structure of the car seem to be built to handle a lot more speed and power. The limited-slip differential has proven very effective. Above 80MPH and at higher revs, the engine gets rather noisy. Handling is Corvette-like, I think the car is rated at above .8g. As a result the ride is rough due to the wide 16-in wheels and 55-series tires. The 4-wheel ABS disc brakes have excellent bite. The rear will wear out before the front.

In the interior, the dash with its white-faced analog gauges is well laid out and the premium CD stereo system packs excellent bass. The manual leather seats have lumbar support for the driver and are comfortable for a sports car. The rear seat are useless (no legroom at all--not good for passengers with feet:-)

The car has been very reliable as well. Nothing has been necessary at 76,000 miles other than regular maintenance. These cars are solidly built in Japan and will easily last beyond 200K miles.

This car is ideal for a single young professional conscious of his/her image. It is not a practical vehicle for those with lots of friends. The horsepower to weight/size ratio of this vehicle will keep inexperience sports car drivers from getting into too much trouble. You can find a used one for $10-13K depending on condition and options(defintely look for one with limited-slip differential).<br><br>
