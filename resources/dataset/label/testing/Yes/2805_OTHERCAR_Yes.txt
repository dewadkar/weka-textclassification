            I got my Digital camera in August of 99 and since then it has been used quite often. I use it for business so naturally its been taking a beating.
I take macro shots so i can upload the images to my business web site so I needed a camera that could take very good clean close ups and the D400Z was the right one for the job. I had tried out and actually bought a few other cameras to see if they could take good macro shots. None of the Canons could even compare!  I took them all back and finally found the right one. I even tried the nice Toshiba digital camera and that one didn't even give a clear macro shot.

The only gripes I have with the camera is the battery life and download time. I bought a Rechargeable battery set and a power adapter for when I do the downloading and that fixed the battery problems.

All in all, the camera works great and it has some great features on it.<br><br>
