            I had never thought about purchasing a Volvo until my husband started working for them. He was the computer guy for one of the local dealerships and was given the opportunity to use their cars while on the job. He would come home everyday telling me how nice the cars were and how fast they were, etc. It just so happened that at the same time my mom was looking to find a new car. My husband recommended the Volvo S70. My mom test drove it and was pretty happy with it and decided to purchase it. A few weeks after she got it home, she started noticing things that she didn't like. For instance the door handle would pinch her fingers and everytime she put the car into park, she would scrape her knuckles on the tape deck. These are all minor things but it's enough to make you dissatisfied with a car. Other things were that the front seats are so tall that #1 they make it hard to see (blind spot, while in reverse, etc) and #2 they block out a lot of sound so that if I'm in the back seat, I have to almost yell to be heard. My pet peeve about the car is that if I'm driving and I have a hair clip or something in my hair, I have to tilt my head forward because the headrest is so high and there is no way to adjust it. One of the other things that surprised me is that about 4 months after she purchased it, one of the headlights went out. Upon taking it to be replaced, we learned that Volvo lights usually need to be replaced every 7000 miles. That is a very short time especially on a car that uses daytime running lights. My mom can't wait until her lease is up and she says that next time she'll buy something else. I think they are pretty nice cars but it seems that they have a lot of design flaws.<br><br>
