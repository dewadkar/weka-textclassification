            I currently own a 1996 Black Toyota 4Runner. The car has been exceptionally well to me, but there have been some problems. Lets start with the good, first however. The truck handles really well, better than any I've ever driven. It turns with ease, the climate control is good, the safety features are excellent (air bags, window locks), good defrost and windshield wipers, lots of room for both shotgun passenger and back seat passengers, lots of room in the back, trunk flip up is really cool, and it looks really good from the outside. The negative things are the bumpy ride ocassionally, needs 4*4, in the shop way to much for unneeded repairs (like axel breaks, wheel alignment, etc. etc.) Thats all the negatives I can pull out. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives and I would recommend a 4runner to whoever wants girls to complament you on your car. It also handles very well and it is good if you like that stuff also.<br><br>
