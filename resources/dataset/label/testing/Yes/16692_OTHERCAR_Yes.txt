            I really do like this camera, although it has a couple of drawbacks.

First and foremost it produces high quality 1.3 megapixel images. It also produces high quality mpeg movies - great for web sites.

Second, it stores them on regular floppy disks - no memory sticks or devices taking up valuable ports on my PC. Granted, the storage space of a floppy requires you to carry a bunch of them, but they are so easy to use and make transferring images around a breeze. Sometimes I just want to take an image over to a friends PC - having it on floppy is so much easier. If you need the memory stick - there is an adaptor that you can use.

The biggest drawback in my opinion is the fact that the camera freezes the image you are looking at (a sort of preview) before making the capture. However, the image that freezes is not what get's stored - so you can somtimes not get what you think your pointing at. Also, I feel this makes the camera inappropriate for any fast action or sports shooting.

Another drawback is the battery. It holds it's charge for just about 2 hours (although you can upgrade to a better battery. The biggest thing is that the camera itself is the charger. I don't really want to use my $800 dollar camera to charge batteries, but I can't seem to locate a separate charger. Also, it would be nice if I could also use AA batteries when the charge ran low.

I use this camera for putting photos and video quickly on the web. A friend of mine used it to photograph his wife's line of cosmetics for sale on the web. This, and pure recreation, are probably the best uses for the FD-85.<br><br>
