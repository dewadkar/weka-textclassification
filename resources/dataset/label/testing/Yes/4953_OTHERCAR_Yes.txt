            My previous experience with a digital camera has been with the "snapshot" feature on an analog video camera. The quality was awful but you could download the photos through a serial port which was kind of cool.  I later saw digital cameras at parties and weddings but more as a novelty because the price was so prohibitive and the quality not much better.

Recently I was getting some photos developed and glanced at the shop flier and was surprised at how prices had dropped. With an upcoming wedding I thought this might be a good opportunity to check out what's available.  We spent about 3 hours with the salesman trying out the various brands. And for the price, hands down the Nikon Coolpix 4300 was the best.  The features were very easy to use, with a nice automatic mode for beginners then a manual mode for advanced users. 

<B> Goods </B>
The first thing we liked about it was the on/off switch was separated from the shot mode.  Our previous camera the on/off was on the same dial as the auto focus/manual mode and it was very easy to accidentally switch the camera on.

Second, this was the cheapest 4 Megapixel camera we found with similar features. The more Megapixels the camera has the larger the photograph can be enlarged without suffering quality.

Third, downloading pictures is a breeze with the USB connector.  This is so much easier then the old serial method especially with my USB port on the front of my PC.

Fourth, this camera is very easy to get up and running. The optical zoom is easy to use, however the digital zoom is a little strange. You have to hold the zoom down for an extended period then the digital zoom kicks in.

Fifth, the Coolpix 4300 is quite small for the features (not as small as the Canon Elph). One of the best features is the grip makes the camera fit nicely in your hand.  This is one of the few cameras that you can hold onto easily with one hand.

<B> Bads </B>
One thing we were disappointed with was the video feature. We were told at the camera shop that you could take 40 second videos in QuickTime format. When we used the feature at a wedding there is no sound.

Second, the digital zoom and auto-focus are slow. The camera seems to be making constant adjustments even if you keep the focus on the same shot. The camera makes a soft clicking sound while it is focusing or zooming.

Third, it is annoying that the lens tries to extend every time you turn the camera on even with the lens cap on. You have to turn the camera on and remove the lens cap to download pictures.

Another issue we had was that downloaded pictures looked darker then the printed picture. This can be attributed to the PC we were are viewing the pictures with.

<B> Other </B>
The software that comes with the camera is fairly generic but we were not expecting a full fledged publishing application.  It's easy to setup and start downloading pictures and has the standard photo-editing options.
