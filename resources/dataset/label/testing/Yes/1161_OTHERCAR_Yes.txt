            After being a dyed-in-the-wool SUV enthusiast for the past six years, I was a bit hesitant to go back to a compact car. However, after several test-drives (and some pretty hefty repair bills for my Blazer), I was convinced that the 2000 Neon was the one to get me out of the gas crunch, as well as keep me safe on the road. However, the real bonus is the Neon's performance. It is awesome on the corners, and never lets me down on those 8% grades that we have around here. On the interstate, it gets out there with the instant acceleration that you need. Careful on that gas pedal - you have to make sure you don't go TOO fast. The Neon is also a nice looking car, with good visibility all around, plenty of interior room and comfort and a nice sound system. I also find that the environmental controls are much improved over other models. The only problem I have encountered is in getting used to the quick steering -I have a tendency to over-steer, and have had a few close calls. The Neon would be a great car for someone who spends a lot of time on the road, and who needs to have an economical, comfortable and good-looking car. The large cargo space is also a plus for anyone who does a lot of traveling. I would not recommend this car for anyone who drives on rough roads or un-paved roads, since it does not have a lot of ground clearance.<br><br>
