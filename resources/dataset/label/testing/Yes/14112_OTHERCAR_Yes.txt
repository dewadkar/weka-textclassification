            I have owned four pickup trucks. I started with a 93 Truck, then a 94 T-100.  I bought my first camping trailer, and bought a 00 Tundra V6 Regular Cab.  Lastly, I got a bigger camping trailer and purchased the 02 Tundra SR5 extended cab with the V8.  

I only use my truck to haul trash, wood, and to go camping.  I just took a trip to the gulf coast and put 2500 miles on it.  It currently has a little under 12000 on it.

The truck is a perfect towing vehicle.  My best gas mileage is around 11.5, and the worst is around 8.  The low end was caused by going around 80 though.  My camping trailer weighs somewhere around 5200 lbs (wet).  Without the camping trailer, it gets around 18-20.

Both of my Tundras have the same attributes, but the V8 does have some serious kick and pulling power.  I pass people up the mountain with the trailer hitched.  The transmission is very smooth in the 02.

The interior is typically Toyota, everything is ergonomically sound and easy to get too.  I would recommend fog lights to anyone that buys this truck.  Both of my Tundras have had this option.  I also recommend the captain chairs, which are wonderful seats.  The back seats are only for short trips in the upright position, however, the back seat is a comfortable bed for one adult (sit or laying sideways).  This has been proven on long trips.  The new double cab should solve this problem.  

I would also recommend getting the bigger 265 tires over the 245 tires.  I did this my on first Tundra, and will do it on my 02 Tundra when the time comes to replace the tires.  The standard Dunlops are tolerable, but substandard.  

My only major disagreement with the truck is that to get the extended cab, I had to give up my long-bed.  Maybe Toyota will address this someday.  

I next truck will be a 3/4 or 1 ton Toyota.  The only question is that if Toyota will ever build it.
