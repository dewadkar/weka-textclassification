            After four hours of driving to the car dealership to pick up my new Dodge Stratus I was pretty tired. I had picked it on a whim because the price was right and I needed a new car desperately. 

I saw my name in the window and the sign that said, sold. I thought it looked alright, not quite 'me' but, I got inside. I hated it. No room!!! I told the salesman I had changed my mind and asked if he had any Intrepids. I had always liked the looks of Intrepids and  every time I saw one I would ask whomever I was with, &quot;What kind of car is that?&quot; I was always bad at remembering vehicle names.

The, little bit flustered salesman led me to a row of shiny  intrepids and I immediately noticed that they didn't quite look like the ones I had seen before. My gawd....these 1998 models looked even better. 

&quot;I'll take the green one.&quot; And I did...without so much as a test drive. Now this was a family car I could live with, without sacrificing style.

I have three more years to pay on my little baby and than I'll park her for twenty years and bring her out on special occassions. Thats the kind of car she is!!<br><br>
