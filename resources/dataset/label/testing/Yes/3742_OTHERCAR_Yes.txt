            My husband bought this vehicle in 1993 new, he used it for 2 years hauling tools and materials.  Now it is mine it's a Chevy 1500 extended cab 1993 and it is Black!  It has to be the most dependable truck on the road that I have ever driven.  

I have had no major repairs done in 7 years all were minor routine repairs.!  I haul groceries in the back and kids in the backseat.  I live in the woods off an old sand trail where a 4 wheel drive is a must.  I have never been stuck!  

My brother has a Ford~ It's junk!!  My husband says it is time for me to trade in my chevy for a new one!! NOT!!!  Mine is dependable!!

I am a baseball mom so the more room I have the more we enjoy it!  With 3 boys in baseball you can tell why I love it!  Especially with the back seat.  I can fit 6 comfortably.

I would recommend this truck for anyone living out of the cities areas who daily hauls misc. things and who needs 4-wheel drive.

Gas mileage is about 13 miles a gallon.  Not great, but for me since I only have 90,000 on, it's great for my short hauling.

Absoultely no rust on it!  Even in the salted forests of Minnesota!<br><br>
