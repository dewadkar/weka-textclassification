            I bought a 1996 Oldsmobile Eighty Eight in the spring of 1997. It was used, but in top notch shape. This car combines the handling of a German car with the style of Italian grace. You feel all 205 horses when you put the pedal to the metal. The 3800 series two is a wonderful engine. This car is great for the music lovers. The AC Delco Speaker system is underrated. It delivers ear shattering highs and ground shaking lows. I have not had a problem with this car for over 60,000 miles. I would recommend this car to a die hard GM buyer. I know because i am one myself. <br><br>
