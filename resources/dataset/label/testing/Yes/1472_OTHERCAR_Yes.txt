            This is my first SUV I have owned all kinds of cars and luxury cars. My last car was a cadillac Eldorado , it was a great performing car but, with all the large trucks and suv's on the road I felt like I was sitting on the ground and about to be run over by them!!I began to look at SUv'S 
(if you can&quot;t beat them join them) I purchased a 2000 Escalade, The Escalade comes equipped with the ON STAR system ,to guide you if you are lost,to get you gas or assistance if you are in trouble, if air bag deploys they will call you to make sure you are ok, and send help if needed. You can even get directions. The car rides great, it is very quiet, it comes with everything from the factory CD/power/leather/auto almost everything ETC&gt;
    The Escalade rides and handles great,excellent visibility great seeing over all those low to the ground Luxury vehicles. It is poor on gas mileage about 11 MPG town and 16 HWY. The two things I was surprised it does not have are a locking gas thank door and low fuel warning light or chime to warn you are running low on fuel. Great warranty program and maintenance program included.
