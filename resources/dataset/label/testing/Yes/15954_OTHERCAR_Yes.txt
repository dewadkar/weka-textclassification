            I bought this camera in April 2000 for $300.00 from the Apple Store.  As I was new to digital cameras, this Epson was my first.  The camera was easy to set up and configure. It comes with a USB drive to hook up to your PC or Mac.  This is a good camera for first timers or for those who want a simple camera. 

Here is some important information for those of you who have some experience with digital cameras are are contemplating a purchase of this model:  

1)  This is a 1 mega pixel camera, meaning that the quality of the picture it renders is good enough for emailing or 4x6 prints through Snapfish or Ofoto.

2)  There is no zoom or wide angle feature.  This is a fixed lens.  You cannot get closer to objects or people.

3)  You cannot override the autofocus in order to manually focus on an object.  Manual focus comes in handy when the camera cannot focus properly in low light situations.

4)  There is quite a long delay between the snap and when the actual picture is taken.  This is bad for action shots.

5)  It hogs batteries.  Energizers last longer than duracells.  Other brands of batteries may last for 10 shots or less.  Energizers last about 45 shots.  Get rechargeble batteries.  

6)  Very durable frame.  I've dropped it several times.  Never a problem.
