            This car has an impressive peak of 320 horsepower and can be compared to the Lexus GS 400s. Thanks to the full time 4 wheel drive, even if the road is slightly slippery, the Jeep can handle almost anything. The Jeep has a V-8 engine with a 2.2 liter Kenne Bell model. The engine made by Kenne Bell adds an microprocessor which monitors the spark and fuel systems to make sure there are no errors that will damage the car.

The Jeep is one of the best cars it has a smooth ride and a mostly quiet for some safe and comfort in the car. The acceleration is good for going out on highways and in extreme corners the Jeep rolls right around it like its nothing. You can also put other modifications like leather seats for those people that can't sit on anything else but that, global positioning system and CD changer<br><br>
