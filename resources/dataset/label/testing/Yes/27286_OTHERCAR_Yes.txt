            First--Why did we get the Dodge Durango 2000?  1. It was time to move to a bigger vehicle.  2. We dreaded buying a minivan.  3. We didn't want to pay a lot for an SUV.  4. We needed a vehicle with 4-wheel drive.  5. We had heard great things about the 2000 from consumers on the Internet and other reports.

We had driven a Toyota 4Runner for three years and now had three kids in car seats.  We had to get a larger vehicle, but we dreaded buying a minivan.  My husband really wanted to get the Toyota Sienna since it had received great reviews in Consumer Reports (along w/the Honda Odyssey--but you can't test drive them here). So, we test drove the Sienna.  That mini-van was nice and it drove fine, but we didn't get excited about it when we were in the driver's seat.  We had no idea how depressed we would feel about having to turn in our 4Runner to get a mini-van for our growing family.

So, after doing more research on the Internet and speaking to owners of the Dodge Durango, we decided to test drive one.  Can I just tell you how nice it was to drive?  The Durango had great pick-up, it was stylish, roomy, less expensive than other large SUVs on the market, etc.  We fell in love.  My husband knew immediately that this was the car for him (us).  

However, we were concerned about the gas mileage--especially with the recent gas price hikes.  After a lot of thought, we decided that life is short.  We needed to enjoy the journey.  We wanted a vehicle that was fun to drive and met our other needs as well.  The mini-vans on the market just didn't do it for us.  

The other concern we had was about the reliability of the Durango 2000. Would it have problems like its predecessors?  Well, we again looked all over the Internet and couldn't find people with any major concerns or problems with the 2000.  Most everything we read was positive.  So, we got the vehicle.  Now, we have only had this SUV for three months, but we have been more than pleased.  

1. We love the stylish exterior.  Even the Hunchback of Notre Dame would look cool in this SUV.

2. We love the pick-up power.  Even up our big hill, it does great!

3. We love how easily the third row folds down.  Our kids have no trouble climbing into the back seat with the middle row seat that just tumbles forward. 

4. We love the stadium seating for our kids in the way back.  We can also see them better in the rear-view mirror because they are a little higher than the middle row.

5. We love the hidden compartment in the very back where we can stow umbrellas, jumper cables, paper towels, etc.

6. We love the million cup holders in this vehicle.  This feature comes in handy if you are going to haul more than a few passengers.  

7. We love so much about this vehicle that we want to keep it after our lease is up in a few years.

WHAT DO WE NOT LIKE?

1. The steering wheel feels a little rough

2. The doors are so heavy that they swing out a little fast when you open them (be careful about dinging other cars).

3. My husband thinks it is a little too bouncy, but my kids love it!

4. The poor gas mileage (obvious).  Remember life is short--enjoy the ride.
 
So, for all of these reasons, we recommend this vehicle to you.  How were we to know that driving an SUV could be this nice?<br><br>
