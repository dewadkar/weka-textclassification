            Due to the wonderful generosity of a relative I've had the opportunity to buy a new car.  The cars I considered were the Ford Focus ZTS and the Mazda Protege LX...

The Focus has been in Europe for the last few years (where they need super-good gas mileage) and has been slightly modified for Americans. It's too early to rank in any safety and reliability tests yet but the dealer told me its initial tests have been good, whatever that means.   

Just for the same annoying terminology let me clarify some Focus lingo:

LX - bare bones
ES - nice!
ZTS- par le vouz fancy!

The Focus comes standard with roadside assistance and full warranty for 2-3 years and up to 30K, and full crumple zones (so be careful not to back up into a mailbox or your car is gone!). The ES and ZTS come with side air bags and anti-lock brakes (why are safety measures considered luxuries?). It's also $800 extra (each) for automatic transmission and keyless entry (the former is a necessity).  When I asked the dealer about that he compared it to the Dodge Neon which charges even more for simple add-on's. 
  
When you upgrade from the ES to the ZTS in the Focus you also get a cd-cassette stereo, faux wood paneling around your doors, windows, stereo, and climate controls which is surprisingly attractive.  

They all have 4 cylinder engines which was kind of hard for me to get used to because I was used to the far more powerful V6. The drive was super quiet and it was nice to zip around in something so tiny, parallel park with such ease! 

The backseats were ok, it was cozy but I'm 5'10&quot; and was pretty comfortable back there.  The dealer kept trying to sell me on the tilt wheel and seat and armrest (grrr).  The rear seats also fold down and the trunk is huge!  It even comes with a glow in the dark &quot;let me out&quot; button which makes me wonder who this car is being marketed to.  That seems like a good feature for a family car but the ads have been all about cool 16 year olds.  Is this a reaction to all the college fraternities' hazing mishaps?

Eventually I decided to go with the Protege because I didn't feel good about driving a car manufactured in NAFTA's Satanic workshop that hasn't even existed in America yet and the dealer was kind of a jerk.  


UPDATE:  It turns out the keyless entry is standard in the ZTS &amp; the ES and available for $395 (with power locks) for the LX.  Thanks to the dude that NR'd me for bringing this to my attention.  <br><br>
