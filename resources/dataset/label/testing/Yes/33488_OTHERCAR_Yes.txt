            In 1992, I purchased a '92 Hyundai Scoupe LS. It was my first automobile, And I loved it. The performance was excellent. The warranty was beautiful. It was small, comfortable and attractive and fully equipped for a very small price tag. I lost my car in 1994 due to an accident. And even though it wasn't that bad of an accident, the insurance company wanted to total it because they felt it &quot;just wasn't worth it.&quot;
It had a comfortable drive, the features were absolutely unparalleled by any other car I inquired about or test drove at that time. I STRONGLY recommend this car to the first time buyer, or the someone who wants the sport look, and the sport feel,without the sport price. I wouldn't recommend this car to someone with a large family, or to someone who is hard on vehicles.  I was crazy enough to purchase two other vehicles since this (a $31,000 car and a $30,000 car), but I recently traded an S.U.V. for the 2000 Hyundai Sonata GLS.
I feel safe to say Hyundai has me for life.....<br><br>
