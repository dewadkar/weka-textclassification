            I purchased the '93 Integra LS 4-dr three years ago with 110K miles.

<b>Design</b>
The overall design of the car is very pleasing.  Not only it looks stylish but has a very balanced design.  The window is easy to clean since there's no frame around the edge.  Of course this can be bad if a thief is trying to pry open your window which can be done easily.  The doors are designed well and have a very sturdy weight to it.  Space-wise, there are plenty of room for 4 adults and the trunk allows you to put full load of groceries.  The visibility is great in this car just with many Honda/Acura sedans.  The side mirrors can be controlled electronically by a switch inside while you have the defrost for the rear window.  The seats are also comfortable, it wraps around just like the bucket racing seats that'll keep you from swaying around corners.  The rear seat is also indented where you sit which keeps you in a comfortable position.  The backseats can also be folded down when you open the key lock located in the back console.  This allows you put long merchandises and even full size snowboards!

<b>Engine</b>
The LS model is a non-VTEC 1.8L engine with a great gas mileage that will give you 300 miles to a full tank (I believe 11 gallons for a tank).  There's one thing about changing oil.  The oil filter is very hard to reach so I'd recommend buying a special oil filter remover that's shaped like a claw.  (I used the regular oil filter remover & would not work!)  The engine is relatively quiet considering it's a 1993 model.  On the freeway you'll hear the outside noise more but it's still a very comfortable ride.  Working under the hood may seem a little tight although maintenance wise, it's a great car & I honestly haven't had a problem other then all the worn out parts.

<b>Overall Driving</b>
The car handles really well.  Even though it's heavy it still has a good stopping power.  It also has a good acceleration for an automatic.  The Integra feels well balanced and allow you to control your car precisely.  The cruise control also helps for long drives while the stock AM/FM/Cassette player will keep you entertained.  The vehicle's radio antenna comes up when you use the radio.  The headlight may needs adjustment looking at the beam pattern.  You won't get a lot of light to the side while most the beams are concentrated in the middle.  But the fog lamp in the middle can be adjusted to use with the driving lights at night which helps.  (The light bulbs are very easy to change for this car)

<b>Something to note...</b>
My LS got broken into from the passenger side once.  It was a vandalism but the glass was quoted for $525 for the cheapest price.  The after-market parts and other parts seem relatively more expensive for this model since after '94, the new Integra's design was put in place.
