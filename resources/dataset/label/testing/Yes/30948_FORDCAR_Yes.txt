            I bought my Contour in 1995 because I wanted a car that would be comfortable for commuting to work and big enough to use for transporting multiple bicycles and people to races around the Rocky Mountain region.

Now, in June 2000, my Contour has 150,00 miles on it.

I think I'm qualified to offer a good, realistic evaluation of the Contour.

Repairs - nothing substantial, other than the expected replacement of the alternator parts that usually wear out on all cars and one fuse.  I also had to have the heater blower switch replaced but that was covered by Ford when the car had 140,000 miles on it.  I've replaced tires and brakes one time. 

I've changed the oil between 15K and 20K miles.  Why?  Because it doesn't need to be changed any more often on my car.  That's probably true for all new cars, though.

My only gripe about the Contour is the flakey way that the seat backs are adjusted. Ford uses a big knob on the side of the seat that one must crank around to raise or lower the seat back.  I hardly ever need to use it but it's a pain when I do.

On the plus side - I REALLY like how Ford designed the cruise control and radio.  It may not seem like a big deal to others, but all controls are touch coded so that you can adjust them without any need to take your eyes off of the road.  That's important to me.

Frankly, given the fact that I've basically ignored most preventive maintenance, I'm a little surprised that my Contour is still going so well.

That's it - I strongly recommend this vehicle.  Too bad Ford is going to stop production and replace both it and the Escort with a single model.
