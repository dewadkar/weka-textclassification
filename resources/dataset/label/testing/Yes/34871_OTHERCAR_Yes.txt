            I�ve had my 2000 Honda Odyssey EX for about six months now, and I really like it.  I must say that I�ve hauled more inanimate stuff than people, and the van has served me well.  I�ve hauled: tons of bricks, 12 foot long 2x4�s, alpaca poop (great for plants, doesn�t stink), dozens of plants, bag upon bag of bark, gravel and more.  I�ve taken to calling the Odyssey my �pick-up truck.� With the rear folding seat and the movable middle seats, it�s a breeze to fit most anything in the back.

There are so many reviews about the good stuff, that I won�t repeat it all here.  Except to say that I love those automatic sliding doors.  A great way to wow the commuters I pick up! The fold down third seat is fantastic (though a little bit heavy for a shortish, weakish woman like me)

There are a couple of things that could use improvement.  I do not like the climate control system, because I can�t set it to just blow fresh air from the exterior.  It almost always blows some air conditioning or heat, in order to get the �cabin� up to the set temperature.  If you turn off the climate control, you get no air at all.  Also, when the back vent is turned on high it is very loud.

I�m also not wild about the driver�s side left arm rest.  It�s too low and far away.  Maybe they can design an armrest attached to the seat like the one for the right arm, and have it go up automatically when the seat belt is unhooked, so it won�t be in the way when getting out of the car.  

BUT�these are minor inconveniences.  Overall, I love the van, and once I accept the fact that I can still be cool while driving a van, I�ll be as happy as a clam.  I highly recommend the Odyssey to anyone who asks.
