            I had been looking for a new larger car for some time.  Had a CRX Si, upgraded to an Integra GSR and, after getting married, figured I needed a larger "family" car.  But I still wanted some sportiness.  BMW was never a car I considered.  They're nice, but I've been in a number of them and they are all cramped and noisy.  Plus, they're overpriced.

The car I really wanted was the A4.  But a friend of mine mentioned the TL to me, so I took a look.  Being a big Acura fan, it seemed more natural for me to go with the TL anyway.  The more I investigated, the more I loved it. Scratched the A4 off my list and bought a new 2001 TL two months ago.

Everything everyone has said about it is true.  But I have since noticed a few prominent and annoying rattles from behind the dashboard.  Took it to one dealer who replaced some switches, but the rattles are still there.  I paid almost $32,000 after taxes and registration, etc.  As such, I expect a completely silent interior.  Not so.  I plan to bring it back to the place I bought it and see if they can "tighten" it up.  It has ruined an otherwise exquisite experience for me.
