            If you're looking for a smooth and comfortable ride then this is the car for you. The 2000 Nissan Maxima is a fine automobile. I think it's the best car on the market. The one that I own has so many features like: heated leather seats, the Bose stereo system with seven speakers and a built in subwoofer, power moon roof, traction control, climate control, keyless entry, cd and tape player, cd changer option with controls, and much much more. I love the Bose stereo system. With two front tweeters, four normal speakers, and the built in sub on the rear dash makes the music sound great. It doesn't get any better than Bose. 

There's not one thing that I can think of that I don't like about the 2000 Maxima. The ride is unbelievably smooth and the seats are very comfortable. Driving the vehicle is great, very different from driving any other car. It handles awesome, very tight handling, and very fast!! This is by far one of the best cars out there. <br><br>
