            I bought the J30 after riding in one of my professors' car.  It's a beautiful car, both inside and out, but there are some problems that have been haunting me for a few months now.

1.  A/C quits blowing air after about an hour or so.  Dealer says that it needs to be replaced.  Big BUCK$$$!!!

2.  Faulty temperature sensor causes A/C not to regulate inside air temperature.

3.  Very harsh ride.  Rear struts are leaking.  The infiniti dealer is the only one that sells these struts.  Once again, big BUCK$$$!!!

4.  Sunroof rattle:  Probably won't have this as an issue is the ride was not so harsh.  

5.  Small, but deep trunk.  

6.  Doors lock and unlock at random.  Dealer says that it's a faulty actuator.

Don't get me wrong, I love the car and, yes, there are some good things to discuss.

1.  Great engine.  I've got 60,000 miles on the odometer and it still runs very smoothly.  Passing traffic is never very difficult.

2. Audio system.  The Bose audio system sounds great.  Not bad for a factory system.

3.  I love the cockpit feel.  I feel like I'm in total control of the car.

4.  If you carry passengers, there are very comfortable rear seats.  The leg room can be a bit cramped if the driver and passenger are long legged (not an issue for me).

I've driven other Infiniti models and I love them.  Quite honestly, I think that just got a bad apple.  I would suggest you check the above items before you buy.  As far as the service, the Infiniti dealer here in Austin has been great, I am always treated great.  Enjoy, but find a good one.  They are out there.  Happy shopping.
