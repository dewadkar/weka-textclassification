            I've used several digital camera's, but this is the first one I've purchased. Bought it at Sears, they will price match Internet prices + shipping, and have a 30 day return policy, which is awesome.  So far I'm very happy with it and a friend was so impressed that he went out and bought one too. 

If you want a simple to use, point and shoot camera, that takes good pictures this one is great. If you are a pro photographer or think you are, this does have a lot of features, but not as many as more expensive ones. 

I compared several brands and kept coming back to a couple Olympus' and this one. For the money this one is hard to beat, 2 megapixels, 3x optical zoom, USB, 16mb of storage, rechargeable batteries included, and if I don't like I can take it back. Most other cameras in this price range need more memory and rechargeable batteries, so add another $100, with the Fuji 2600 if you want more memory it's $20 - $50. 

I had to hold myself back from going overboard on this purchase. I wanted to buy a $500 Olympus but it only had a few things better than this and I still needed to buy memory and batteries.  What I kept reminding myself was this was my first digital camera, find out how I really use it, what I like and don't like, and then figure out what I really want in my next one. No sense wasting money on camera that will be half the price in 6 months or for the same money, I'll be able to buy twice the camera in 6 months.
