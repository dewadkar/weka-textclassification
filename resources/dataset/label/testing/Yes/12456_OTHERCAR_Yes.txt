            My new Volvo S40:
----------------

I bought my new S40, yesterday. To add to the details presented in my previous epinions, &quot;this is one fine piece of machinery&quot;. Mine is a 2000 model with the touring package. The touring package includes additional features like premium speakers, leather steering wheel, trip computer, a CD player and 8-way powered drivers seat. The other optional packages are : Weather, Sun roof and the Sports packages. Each of these have an additional cost on the base price, which is $23,400 (MSRP). Well, actually, I've seen a number of Audi A4s on road, which cost about the same. Audi does not have all the safety features that Volvo does, that being the pitfall. Coming to its features,

Safety:
------

* WHIPLASH protection. The driver and the
  companion seats move backwards in the 
  event of an accident.

* SIPS(Side Impact Protection) airbags pop
  out in the event of an accident.

* Reinforced steel outer rim which is designed
  to absorb impact-energy and distribute it 
  all over the body of the car

* Airbags are sensitive to impact. They pop out
  only if needed.

* Electronically controlled ignition. The key
  has a micro-chip, in which the code changes
  every time the car is turned on.

* CD player locks itself, on a code, in the 
  event of a theft.

Other features:
--------------

* Weather/Sports mode for better traction and
  also heating.

* Automatic Sound Control(ASC) - adjusts the speaker
  output based on the speed of the vehicle. Alpine
  makes the audio system for Volvo.

* Bucket seats are pretty comfortable. Drivers seat
  is 8-way, electronically programmable.

* There are several modes in the trip computer which
  reads the outside temperature, miles-per-gallon, 
  miles remaining, speed limit alarm, etc.

* Homefinding headlights can be kept on for a minute
  till you find your way, through the dark.

* Adjustable steering wheel. 

* Flush lights are at strategic points.


Driving experiences:
-------------------

* Very good on-road stability. Infact, my friend 
  realized we were on 70mph only after peeping
  into the speedometer.

* The ASC system responds very well. 

* Not much of a throw-off when you make sharp
  turns.

* Good initial torque. So, pickup is excellent.


What I, probably, miss in this car:
--------------------------------

* Cup-holder in the front is not very well 
  designed. Probably two cup holders would
  have worked well.

* A little bit of extra leg room at the back.

I've heard comments about this being a pricey car. I'd retort. For all the features that it has, I think (and, also my pals) that I made a good choice in buying this car. In the long run, I expect it to serve very well.<br><br>
