            9 months ago, we had no camera (our 35mm Olympus had busted) and two of the most perfectly adorable kids you could ever find. Our video camera's battery would not take a charge, and these kids were really being amazingly adorable. 

We were using those throw away cameras, the $10 for 39 shots, plus developing, and it was like throwing money away. We needed a camera, and as always, we did months of research. 

At the time, there was only one digital camera that didn't use a "memory stick", which is a card to keep your pictures on until you can get back to your computer and dump them onto your hard drive. The technology is workable and it can hold around 60 to 100 pictures, but if you happen to be away from your computer (on vacation, at work, kid's adventures) you fill up the card, and you can't take any additional pictures, short of buying another card, which are upwards of $60. And more importantly, if you're busy/lazy and you don't dump the pictures right away, you can't take any more pictures until you do. So when Junior climbs into the dishwasher and you want the picture, the card is full, you have to transfer the files, you lose 10 minutes, and the shot is gone forever.

Enter the floppy disk Sony Mavica. It puts your images on the ubiquitous disk, which are virtually free (seriously, check out computer ads... rebates for the full amount) and are always available to buy, no matter where you are. When you fill a disk, you grab another, and another, and another. You can stack them in a special place near your computer and load them by copying the files onto your hard drive WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT. It takes a long time to fill up a hundred disks, so you're always ready to take a picture.

This camera can hold from 3 pictures (highest quality) to 30 pictures (lowest quality, but very acceptable for computer screen viewing) per disk. Translation: That trip to Disney World and 20 disks equals around 500 pictures.

But there's something else the camera does... it takes video clips with sound. One disk can hold 60 seconds worth of a small video (hold the button down continuously), or 15 seconds of a larger video. Ever hear a grandma with a computer marvel at your daughter singing "daddy be a horsey" that you e-mailed her seconds after the event? It's what digital cameras are all about.

The battery that comes with the standard box lasts about 90 minutes, and it shows the life left right on the screen. There's another battery you can buy which goes for 2 or 3 times as long, but it's a very fast recharge, and we've only run out of juice a few times by watching the meter and choosing shots wisely if necessary.

The lens is good, but not professional. I've taken shots of the Empire State Building, wide and zoom, that are phenomenal as it shows the whole building, and then the top finial detail. I've taken shots of jewelry for my parent's eBay excursions, and with the Macro setting, and the lens at less 1" away... they come out perfect.

The size is big, and it's not light. But with our family, taking the camera along is an investment... and it's always been worth it, especially since we tend to lose smaller things anyway.

I also use the Mavica for my work as an architect. From daily jobsite photos that can be e-mailed to a client out of town, to field investigation images, to pictures of existing projects that i can take one morning and put together for the afternoon presentation, this thing has been a HUGE help. With a good quality printer (HP 11x17 color job) I can put together very high quality presentation boards in 1/8th the time it used to take to shot the picture, develop it, scan it, and manipulate it. And with limitless pictures to choose from, there's always that Perfect Image to get the point across.

There's also the color viewfinder, which isn't great in bright sunlight, but which is perfect otherwise. You can preview and postview your shots. When you take the perfect picture, and you see it right away, and you show it to the 5 year old girl whose image it is, there's nothing like it.

And because the controls are so simple, that 5 year old can take all the pictures she wants, giving you a small insight into what a little kid sees, and giving her a unique way to express herself.

Ok, so you don't have a handy glossy photo of every shot you take. But the truth is, you don't always need that. And the larger truth is, the image you see on the computer screen is 8"x10", backlit and gorgeous, even at the lowest quality setting. We print only the best ones, and we have the balance on a computer photo album program. We e-mail with ease, and we view with ease, and we enjoy slideshows on-screen over and over.

But the best part is the price. The camera itself was $700, a big investment. But, I've done the math, and consider this: A roll of film, 24 exposures, is around 5 bucks. It's another $10 to 12 bucks to develop 3x5 prints. That comes to about $0.62 per print. Accordingly, to break even on the cost of the digital camera, you would have to take around 1,100 pictures. Since we bought it 9 months ago, we have taken over 4,000 shots. Included in those are videos that are priceless... our son walking for the 1st time, our daughter singing, birthday celebrations. 

There's no way we would have taken 4,000 pictures with a 35 mm camera. No way to have the images we have that are of every day joys. No way to share these images with friends and family. 

Of course, that last bit is true for most any digital camera, but the Mavica makes it easy, and fun, and inexpensive, and I wouldn't recommend anything other digital camera to anybody.
