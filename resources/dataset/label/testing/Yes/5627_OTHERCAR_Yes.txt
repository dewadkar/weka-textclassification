            I've taken some short trips (about 2 hours in length) in a friend's base model Vibe. I was immediately impressed with the Vibe's styling. I think it's much better-looking than its sister car, the Matrix - it has a dynamic, contemporary look, but isn't exaggerated (I think it's also much better-looking than the PT Cruiser). The overall shape is pleasing - not too boxy, not too angular - and the elements are balanced and well-proportioned. The image that comes to my mind is of a comfortable running shoe. I also like the fact that the car comes in some very handsome colors.

I was also impressed with the Vibe's features. The separate rear window and lift-gate; the versatile folding seats (including the fold-flat passenger seat); the durable plastic cargo floor; the tie-downs and storage bins; the power outlets, especially the 115-volt up in front (a great idea); the standard CD player; the VW-style roof-mounted antenna (generally, the higher the antenna, the better the reception - it also looks sharp, and is unaffected by automatic car washes, although it might interfere with long roof loads).

Taking the driver's seat, I was further impressed by the seat fabric. Instead of the usual cheap velour in  nauseating colors, the Vibe uses a durable (but stylish and understated) synthetic mesh. Very refreshing, and well-suited for a car like the Vibe.

I found the Vibe's seats to be comfortable and well-shaped for the class (I'm 5'10, 170#), with a nice firmness. I really liked the upright driving position, and the adjustable steering wheel had a nice thickness and texture. The car felt roomy, in large part due to its upright posture and ample headroom.

I was generally pleased with the placement and feel of the controls. I especially liked the radio's rubberized tuning knob (a tuning knob is much easier to operate than tuning buttons, and I don't understand why more sound systems don't use them). The knob and other details gave me the impression that an unusual amount of thought went into the car.

Upon driving, I was surprised at the car's solid feel. Steering, stability, braking and handling seemed quite good for the class, and the car's agility often put a smile on my face (bearing in mind that I'm not an aggressive driver and usually drive a larger car). In normal driving, the car had plenty of pick-up and never seemed buzzy. Noise levels were reasonable for the class (normal conversation was no problem), and there were no rattles. As I drove, my positive impressions of the seating and other features remained. After a two-hour trip, I did not feel at all fatigued. The spacious feel of the interior seemed to make traveling easier.

There were a few negatives: considering the tasteful execution of the rest of the car, I was somewhat disappointed by the dash design. The chrome trim around the gauges and dash is garish and unnecessary (and seems out of character with the rest of the car). The large metallic control panel seems overly trendy and ill-proportioned. I would reverse the positions of the climate controls, putting the temperature control closest to the driver rather than the air-flow control (a nit-pick). The volume knob should be larger than the adjacent tuning knob (another nit-pick - the fact that a rubberized tuning knob is provided in the first place is a real plus). The cargo cover is too much of a fuss - I took one look at it and decided not to bother (why don't more manufacturers use the simple and effective hinged panel that's been used on the VW Golf/Rabbit for 25 years?). The plastic cargo floor has its advantages, but things tend to slide around if they aren't tied down. The tray on the fold-down passenger seat was not completely flat.

I think one has to measure these reviews against one's expectations. The Vibe is not as sporty as some cars, but in my opinion it's a very sensible package that is fun to drive around town, with the added advantage of nice looks and Toyota reliability. It offers many of the desirable attributes of an SUV - upright posture, versatility, durable materials - without the drawbacks. Definitely worth considering if you're looking for a sensible, versatile, affordable vehicle.
