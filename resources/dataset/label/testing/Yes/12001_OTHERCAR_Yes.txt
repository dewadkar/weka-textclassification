            So I got to drive a friends s2000 the other day, interesting experience to say the least.  It's defiantly a head-turning car, unique look that really does work (at least in my humble opinion).

The s2000 struck me as a very refined, well balanced all around roadster with ONE critical thing missing, torque.  It doesn�t have any!  So how does the car generate such great HP numbers, simple, RPMs.  This little guy tachs all the way up to 9000rpm, amazing, Honda really knows how to make an engine scream.  When you really get on the throttle and let the revs build the car emits this wonderful, almost sport-bike like roar.  Up in that high rpm band the car has somewhat good acceleration, compared to your everyday economy car it's fast, but honestly, it really isn't that fast.  It doesn't have that high-torque, pin you to your seat, s**t eating grin fast thing going on.  This left me disappointed, but then again I'm a speed freak.  Honda doesn�t really deliver in this dept.

Handling is whole other dept, AMAZING to say the least.  First of all it's starts off on the right foot, it's rear-wheel drive, like ALL sports cars should be.  On top of that it's perfectly balanced (pretty sure 50/50) and has an amazingly stiff chassis for a ragtop.  Down-shifting the s2000 a couple gears before a turn, then ripping out of the turn with the throttle planted leaves the driver with great sense of confidence.  Speaking of shifting, it's a six-speed, and a great one at that.  Gearshifts were smooth and flawless, felt like a little joystick clicking into it's predestined position. The clutch was somewhat stiffer than your everyday econo-box, which I expect from a sports car.  Let me reiterate I still can't get over how well the car handled.  Solid, reassuring, and very refined.

The overall package is excellent.  You get a head turning, ragtop with all the emenaties (except a cup holder, sports car shouldn't have any?), excellent marks in the handling dept, and somewhat of a disappointment in the acceleration dept.  I liked it, but would checkout other candidates before shelling out the dough.  It's slightly over-priced for what you get, MSRP is pretty much dead-on, but dealers are using the limited edition BS to jack up the price.
