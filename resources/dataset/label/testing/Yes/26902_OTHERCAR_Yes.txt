            Although our Camry is a 1991...it is still great!  As Toyota always does, it has maintained its quality through the years.  While the style of the Camry has changed over the years (it looks to be a bit bigger in the newest models), it still has the same Toyota quality you expect.

When we were forced to buy a new car (forced because our other car was totaled in a car accident), we knew Toyota was at the top of our list. Besides the obvious things everybody wants, a quality car that will last, we had a few &quot;fun&quot; things in mind.  One of the things on the top of our list was a sun roof.  A REAL sun roof.  The kind that actually opens up and reveals the sky.  Not the newer &quot;moon&quot; type of sun roofs where it cracks open and you get a little air flow.  The 1991 Toyota Camry had the exact sun roof we were looking for.  Don't get me wrong...we didn't base our decision to purchase this Toyota based on the sun roof...it was just added bonus.

We bought a Toyota based on its reputation (and previous experience with Toyotas).  They are know to last long and wear well!  Our Toyota has over 100,000 miles on it and doesn't show any signs (knock on wood) of stopping soon.  We are in fact hopeful that it will still be around and kicking when our son turns 16 and we can pass it on to him.

Our family has grown through the years (we are now a family of five) and although we have outgrown the car a little we still love it.  It's just better when we aren't all involved in the car trip!  But it will be perfect for our high school son and know it will work well from him.  It may be almost 10 years old...but it feels new to us!<br><br>
