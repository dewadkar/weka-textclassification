            I've got just one thing to say about this camera ... awesome. It looks good, it feels good, and it takes good pictures. Almost effortlessly. It is about as close to point and shoot as you can get. I like its features: the 2x optical and 3x digital zoom combine to give you 6x zoom. It takes 18 high quality photos on a 8mb Smartmedia card at SHQ 1280 x 960 setting.I have used both the Olympus card and a Scandisk card with equal results. I like the panorama and sequence modes (takes about 10 photos in about 10 seconds). I like the spot metering and the exposure compensation. The macro mode lets you shoot from 8&quot;-31&quot;. I like the 1.8&quot; color LCD viewfinder, and the menu options. I like the large shutter release button, and the easy to find, easy to use wide/telephoto button.
I didn't like the fact that the AC adapter is not included, and the camera can eat up some AA's, so get some rechargeables. I have also tried the Duracell Ultras, and they last a long time. Olympus does include a set of lithium batteries with the camera, and they last a LONG time.
So buy this camera and enjoy it. I sure have.<br><br>
