            I am a single just doing my student teaching who wanted to buy a new car that would not cost me an arm and a leg. I looked for gas efficiency comfort in ride and room up front. Plus a smart look I could be proud of. I found that in my new Toyota. I did not get a lot of options. It rides quiet, gets 40mph on the road, turns on a dime and is very comfortable. Since I have been known to leave my lights on then come out and find a dead battery at the end of the day, the automatic sensor coming on and off are a real asset. I got the four door model, with a great sound system. The trunk is HUGE I can get in and still have room. 
The back seat is not small but it is not vast either. I wish I would have gotten cruise control. The seat border material is funky, that is the only aspect I do not care for. If you are looking for a fuel efficient car that is nice looking and fun to drive and you do not want to pay over 14K the Corolla is for you. I looked at a year older altima and a comparable Nissan and this one gets my vote. It is practical and you can add options. If you want a luxury car you'd go with the Camry and pay the difference.<br><br>
