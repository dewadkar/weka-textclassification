            We bought our 2002 Pontiac Montana recently, and we continue to be pleasantly suprised each and every day.  I do have to say, the payments are a bit steep, but since it's brand new with lots of "bells and whistles" it sure is worth the pricetag!

First of all, let me just get the "bad stuff" out of the way!  I find the red dash lights tough to deal with, a bit tough on the eyes, however I am getting used to them, so perhaps it is just a matter of time.  Also, while the van itself is nice and roomy,  I find the front seats could be a bit wider.  There is plenty of room between the driver and passenger seats so I don't know why they couldn't make them a bit wider or at least move the arm rest out.  If these are the worst problems we encounter,  we will be very thrilled.

We are still finding all sorts of new things about it all the time, lots of "extra" features we didn't expect.  For instance, there is the SCV feature,  which is "speed controlled volume."  This compensates for road and wind noise, and it has three settings (min/med/max).  It gets softer as you slow down, louder as your speed increases.  Another nice feature is the automatic DRLs ("Daytime Running Lights") which come on when the sensor detects that the daylight is getting a bit low.  

Other nice features include the sliding doors on both sides of the van, tinted glass in the side and rear windows,  rear wiper, multiple odometers, oil engine life monitoring system, power windows in furthest side windows, self-sealing tires, anti-theft tracking system and fog lights, just to name a few!  Let me not forget to mention equalizer options, the cup holders in each row of seats, and the "traffic" button, which allows you to find a radio station which gives traffic reports at the touch of a button (a great option for us city drivers!).

The vehicle is sporty in appearance and carries on some of the typical Pontiac features.  The Montana seems to be a cross between an SUV and a typical minivan, and while I haven't seen a whole lot of these on the road, I really have to wonder why.  I would recommed the Pontiac Montana to anyone who wants a lot of family-friendly vehicle for their money.
