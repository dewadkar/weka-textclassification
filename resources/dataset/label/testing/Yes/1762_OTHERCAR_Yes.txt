            I don't think you can find a single person that can honestly look at you and say that they don't like the body styling of the Sebring. Of course there are people out there that think it looks like a bathtub, but those people are few and far between.

This car is a fairly recent addition to the Chrysler line-up, taking the place of one of my favorite cars, the LeBaron. For a reasonable price, you get a great car.

Pros:
You'll get looks up and down the street, this is a gorgeous car any way you look at it. You can get a convertible or coupe, I definitely recommend the convertible, since it is almost the defining touch for the Sebrings. The 2.5 liter V6 that I think comes stock offers amazing power for a 2.5 liter V6, especially with this seemingly heavy car. I'm guessing the 0-60 time to be around 14 seconds. You can squeal the tires from a stop, although not very much. The really amazing thing about this car is that even with the V6, you get an astounding 36/30 highway/city mpg! The interior is very spacious, the rear seat is great and it comfortably sits five people. With the top down, there is a feeling of freedom that I think any convertible would afford. You are sitting way down in the car in the back seat, which decreases wind noise. With the top up, the stock sound system is pretty good, but with it down, the wind will make the speakers hard to hear(surprise, surprise). The trunks space is huge and you could fit all sorts of things back there. I don't have anything to compare the speed of the top coming down, I'm guessing a total of 25 seconds. Minor inconvenience waiting for it to come down.

Unfortunately this car does have its cons:
My friend bought this car at my suggestion, so I feel bad when things go wrong with it. She's had it into the dealer at least twice to have the weather stripping redone, fortunately this car is still under warranty. There is something wrong with the front wheels, she had it replaced also under warranty but couldn't remember what it was. You can't see the nose of this car from the drivers seat, so parking can be a little tedious. A Caravan we rented had this same problem, but I found that you soon got over it and realized how far back from the curb you had to stop. From the air(like in a helicopter or tall building) with the top down this car resembles a bath-tub, but from the ground it just looks like a sports car, see picture above, left. This car looks like a sports car, but it definitely doesn't fulfill the part, it would be nice if Chrysler offered a bigger engine, maybe a small V8 or larger V6.

My friends car was made by Chrysler de Mexico, so it has an odd color on it, a metallic fern green, which was very hard to reproduce after her daughter got in a small fender bender. Someone south of the border put some very nice pinstripes on this car, which are darn near impossible to reproduce. Chrysler de Mexico didn't put any badges on this car, so I don't know if it is a JX or JXi. Of course, this isn't the cars fault...

One thing I've always been worried about, is that if you are driving with the top down and someone bumps the switch, will the top come back up? This could cause major damage. I'm assuming that with the car out of park it is impossible, but we've never tried it. The switch is kind of close to the armrest.

I recommend this car to small families, college students, and single people. The two doors may become an inconvenience if you are constantly putting people in the back seat.
