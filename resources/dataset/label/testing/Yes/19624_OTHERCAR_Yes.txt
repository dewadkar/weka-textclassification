            A few weeks ago, I decided to buy a digital camera. I of course was confused with all the different models and prices out there. After extensive research, I finally decided what I wanted in a camera. First, my use was mainly for downloading and viewing on the computer and e-mailing pics to friends etc. I could not see any use in buying an expensive camera with 5 million pixels if the usage was only for the computer as computer screens can not show that many pixels. It is like buying a tractor trailer to move a couch as compared to a pick up truck. It seemed that all of the other famous brand name models, lacked something here and there that I wanted in the same camera category. I had come to this website and read some of the reviews, and was impressed with how the average user was very happy with his camera. Now I am not going to go into the tech specs of this camera as they are already well covered by other reviewers and on the web site itself. I was totally blown away by the long battery life. When I first got the camera, I went through the well written easy to understand manual, and experimented with all the features, resulting in probably above average battery use. I shot about 400 pics in a few days, all with flash, and over half with the self timer mode, which results in blinking lights, and sound effects, and I would think a little extra drain on the battery. My original battery that came with the camera, did not want to die, and it just kept on going and going to my surprise. I also like the fact it only uses 2 (not 4 like a lot of others out there) AA batteries, which are very popular in many applications around the house. I bought a battery charger and high quality chargeable Nimh batteries, which I can use for all my other gadgets in the house, so I did not consider it an extra cost. I was impressed with the pic quality, both indoors and outdoors and especially the beautiful colours. I was amazed that I could shoot clear pictures while flying my airplane as turbulence did not always keep the camera as steady as one would like. I also took pictures of fast moving cars, and the pics came out perfect every time. I am actually shooting all my pics in the lowest quality mode and the pics are fantastic. I of course tried the highest quality and when viewed on the computer it is hard to tell the difference. Also if you shoot in the high image mode, and download these pics through e-mail to a friend, using a dial up modem it will take a long, long time to send and receive, where the low quality mode is fast, and as mentioned the pic quality for viewing on the computer is still awesome. I also love that unique slide lens cover that you can not lose, and is hard shell. Now I notice some reviewers wrote that the one thing they did not like about this camera, was the fact you had to cover the lens to review your pictures on the LCD screen. After having it, I realized that this design was done on purpose with good intentions as it protects your lens from being accidentally scratched. When I was reviewing some pics, I noticed that I was holding the front of the camera on my knees, which might scratch the lens, if it was not for this cover which has to be shut for this operation. (Hey it only takes a few seconds to slide the cover shut). I of course tried several macro images and was impressed on how close I can get. I have seen me snap newspaper articles and send them to friends. I don't need to buy a scanner now either, as I can get real close to any subject.

So in closing I am not a professional with a camera, and I realize you can get some real fancy cameras, if you are a professional photographer and don't mind spending thousands of dollars to achieve that perfect picture. However for an average camera person, this little guy does it all, with total satisfaction. I can seriously not think of one thing wrong with this camera when you consider the price. I have no interest now in even looking at other cameras as I have found one that does it all for me.
