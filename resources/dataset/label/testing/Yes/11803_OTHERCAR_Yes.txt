            The 1998 Suzuki Esteem 4 door wagon is my first real car.  I bought it about a year ago and it had been used by the dealership as a loaner car.  It has 14,000 miles on it and it was basically brand new.  As soon as I saw the car I knew I had to have it!  It is absolutely adorable!  
When I went out looking for a car, I had a general idea of what I wanted.  I knew I was looking for something that was roomy - I need a lot of space because I do animal rescue, I like to carpool with friends to concerts, I love road trips, and I have a bad habit of picking up old furniture off the side of the road!  Keeping all of that in mind, I knew I wanted a station wagon, but I didn't want to look like an old lady.  
Lucky for me, Subaru Outback's were the rage at the time, but I could not afford one.  When I saw this car, it had all the looks of a Subaru, but without the price tag!

I am not going to bore you with all the details, but I'll tell you some things about my car that I couldn't live with out!
-Ski Racks: I don't ski, but they sure do make the car look important!
-Electric Windows: Did I really have to ROLL up my windows on my first car?  
-Electric Mirrors: I play with these little guys all the time! Up, down, right, leftï¿½

The car has great gas mileage and good power.  The only problems I have encountered so far have been my own fault (accidents), so I have nothing bad to say!  This car is perfect for a first time car owner who's vehicle is like their second home.
