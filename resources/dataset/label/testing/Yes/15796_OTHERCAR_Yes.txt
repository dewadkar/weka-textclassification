            I never thought in a million years that I would be driving a mini van. I'm only 25 years old, why would I want to be driving something that my mom drove me around in. Well, just last year my wife had a baby. We needed a car that would be safe, reliable, and still have plenty of room for the baby's things. I don't know how it happened, but we ended up at the Chrysler dealer. My wife loved the way the Town and Country looked and drove. We were sold. I had to drive it home myself. I was amazed on how it handled. I didn't want to stop driving. It was more than I have ever wanted in a vehicle. Even though it is a mini van, it has plenty of power and a great stereo. This is the mini van for both young and old.   <br><br>
