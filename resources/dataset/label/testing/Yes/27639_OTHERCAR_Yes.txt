            To make such a statement would open one up to the ridicule of all those heavily invested in the latest crop of Lexus, BMW, or even today Mercedes offerings. But the fact remain, borne out by any knowledgeable mechanic, that these cars remain a driving classic. Offered in three engine classes (300, 420 560) corresponding to 3.0 liter straight 6 cylinder , 4.2 liter &amp; 5.6 Liter V-8 this car has generated a most loyal following. The SEL version which is 6&quot; longer than the Se version allows for obscene amounts of leg and head room. Any of the three engine packages supplies more that adequate power to more these behemoths along. Personal experience has show me that I can expect to achieve an average of 20mpg when driving the 6 cylinder version. Due to the gearing difference between the 6 and 8 cylinder versions ( the 6 is considerably lower) the gas mileage difference between these engine packages is not extreme. In fact I would suggest that you might achieve better gas performance at highway speeds (75-85 in these beasts) with the larger engine package. In my opinion these remain the best of Mercedes utilitarian autos. No it is not a classic like the gullwing  but the long body, large interior space and unbelievable road manners coupled with the simplicity of repair make this the ultimate road warrior. I have owned several over the years including a 1988 300 SEL which I was fortunate enough to find with a scant 48,000 miles. 1 year and 55,000 miles later I can confidently state two facts. 1: You will find reasons to drive and 2: you better own a radar detector. This animal cruises effortlessly at 80 mph and leaves the rider feeling as if he is traveling at 40. The solid ride, solid silence and power require that you leave instructions for loved ones behind lest you disappear for long periods of time. Ranging when new from $60,000-$90000 these vehicles can be found in excellent condition (particularly in southern Florida) around the Mid teens. If your in the market for a great automobile for reasonable money consider one of these vehicles. You need only possess two things, 1: a willingness to pay for the occasional repair (Not cheap) and 2: A aptitude for talking your way out of traffic violations.
