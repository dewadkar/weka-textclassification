            My wonderful husband got it for me last Christmas! Good husband! I had been wanting a digital camera for auctions, I had no idea how much more I'd be using it for! It is very easy to use, and I love the fact that if you take a terrible picture, you're not stuck with it! It's outta here!
The close-ups you can get are amazing! I've taken sunsets, baby pics, auction pics, outdoor and indoor. I love the adjustable level of flash too. While I still use my regular 35mm for some stuff, I mostly grab my Mavica for those I gotta capture this moment pictures. If you want a quality, easy to use digital camera, this is a must have for anyone.<br><br>
