            My  99 Ford Escort SE is about 3 1/2 months old. It's a beautiful midnight blue and I have no complaints as of today. This car is comfortable; pretty roomy for the front seat. I don't really sit in the backseat very often but the few times I have, I liked it. 
It gets good gas mileage, about 34 mpg. It's smooth and quiet. I find myself speeding very easily on the highway. It takes the corners very nicely. Acceleration is good if the A/C isn't on. It doesn't make jerky stops or starts. 
I would definitely recommend it for someone just starting out. Payments and insurance are reasonable too.<br><br>
