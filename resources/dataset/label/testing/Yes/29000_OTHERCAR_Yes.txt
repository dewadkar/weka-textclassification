            I recently purchased one of these from my local dealership. I had shopped around for the right one and decided on a metalic blue 5 speed with nice alloy rims and a decent stereo system. For what I intended to use this car for it works better than I had expected. There are so many cool little features to it. First off I purchased it for its all wheel drive, nice cabin space and rock solid reliability. I frequently go on fishing trips and the all wheel drive works wonders through that thick sand and rock down by the shore. Also quite frequently I do a little night fishing and when I quit I just sleep in the car. This might not sound to comfortable but it is. This is the ultimate camping vehicle. Here are some reasons why.<p>
1. Front and back seats fold down and form together to create a very comfortable bed for two people. 
2. The all wheel drive will take on any mild offroad terrain and does pretty well with some of the rough stuff. 
3. Cover for the spare tire compartment is a fold out picnic table. 
4. Clothing hangers everywhere. 
5. Cigarette lighter outlets in front and far back off the vehicle. Very Usefull.
Those are just some of the cool little features this car has. There are many more. The power that comes from the 2.0 liter non V-tech is actually pretty decent. Could use a tad bit more tourque though. For getting around town and climbing average hills it works wonders. The ride is as smooth as pillows and it handles basicly like a lower to the road car. The price is very fair and I am overall very happy with this car. I think we might actually get another one, because we like the first one so much. Also the new model just came out and they only just improved on it, making it an even better car. I highly recomend this car. If you have the chance to buy one, do so. "It is so choice", as the great Farris Bueler said.<p>
I'd like to specify what I meant about the seats. I have sat in many SUV's and of all the ones I have sat in the seats in this one were not as comfortable as the rest. They are supportive and have a good shape but they are not soft enough to mold to the contour of your body like a nicely padded seat does. They are a bit too stiff for me. Also Another thing I forgot to mention the front seats don't come standard with armrests. That is an option you have to pay for. It's rediculous. That would make them a lot more comfortable right off the bat. I keep reaching over to rest my arm and its not there. I mean theres the door armrest but there aren't any on the inside.<p> Also to give an example of how the car drives. There is this windy road by my house that is a good 3 mile stretch. I was following my freind in his modifed Honda rocket, which mind you is lowered with racing rims and tires, and also has a jspec engine with quite a bit more horsepower in a smaller car. Anyways I am cruising along when suddenly he starts sppeding up. So since I didn't want to lose him I sped up as well. Now it might have been that I am an extremely better driver than him but I kept up with him through the whole stretch with minimal body roll and stock tires griping the road quite well. He was pretty amazed. It was also quite fun cause the power on the crv is not like most gutless fours it pulls pretty strong, especially with a 5 speed tranny and the all wheel drive.<p>
Another thing real quick I have looked at the newer model of the CRV and like the modifications they have done. I think I mentioned before only improvements with it. However If I were going to buy another Honda SUV the two new additions have really caught my eye. That is the Pilot and the Element. Both have there own little features that I love. If you have the chance check out all three take a test drive and let me know what you think. Thanks for looking. Hope I have shed a little more light on your choice in buying a car. Take it easy.
