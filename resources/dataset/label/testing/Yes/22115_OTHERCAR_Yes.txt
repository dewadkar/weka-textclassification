            I was in the market for a good digital camera, preferably with zoom capabilities and a LCD display.  This camera has fit the bill perfectly!  It tends to eat up batteries, so the purchase of an adapter is well worth it if you will be taking a lot of indoor pictures.  Otherwise, rechargeable batteries, brand recommended by Kodak, work great too!  It is wonderful for taking internet ready pictures that are easy to upload (USB and serial connections available) and easy to format (comes with Adobe Photoshop and PageMaker).  I had tried several other cheaper versions of digital cameras and was very happy when I came across this one.  It has proved itself to be quite simple to use (for someone that doesn't always get technical) and has continuously turned out good looking pictures.<br><br>
