               I am very surprised over my purchase.
   It is bigger and roomier than it looked from the outside!!!!!!
   I began working for a KIA dealer on December 23,1999. I was without a car and driving my sisters. After a couple of months of successful selling I decided to buy. After consulting with our mechanic I decided to buy a 2000 KIA Sephia LS. I am so glad I did.
   Today I have 11,700+ miles and I average 28 MPG.
   It handles so good. I have no trouble with it all. It is white and looks big. 
   I am most surprised at the roominess on the inside.
   I love the way it takes bumps. It is so smooth.
   I am so pleased!!!!!!<br><br>
