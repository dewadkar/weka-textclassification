            Once upon a time all Volvos were styled much like household appliances, boxy and boring. This began to change with the introduction of the sleek C70 coupe in 1998. A C70 convertible followed soon after. The C70 was based on the boxy S70 sedan, itself based on the 850 which first appeared in 1993. 

Hence, while the lines were stylish and the turbo engines powerful the chassis was dated even at intro, not to mention nearly six years later. So I&#146d never taken these cars seriously, especially once their high prices were figured into the mix. However, a friend of mine was toying with the idea of getting a convertible, and kept bringing up his needs for practicality and safety at the same time (he and his wife have a young daughter). So, after driving a couple BMWs with him I suggested we at least take a look at the Volvo. After all, if anyone is going to make a practical and safe convertible, it&#146s going to be Volvo.

The C70 comes in two forms, the automatic-only LPT (for &#147low-pressure turbo&#148) with a 197-horsepower 2.4-liter turbo and the HPT with a 242-horsepower 2.3-liter turbo and standard 5-speed. The latter base prices at $2,000 more, but adjusting for different levels of standard equipment (automatic optional, but &#147touring package&#148 with wood trim and CD-changer are standard) cuts this to about $1,800.  My friend felt the LPT would serve his needs, but the dealer had only HPTs on hand, so that is what we drove.

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

The C70 coupe was discontinued for 2003, leaving only the convertible. The coupe was the better-looking car of the two. The convertible fully automatic top (just push the button) is large and adds a bit much visual mass to the top of the car. The coupe&#146s rear roofline was much sleeker. Still, it&#146s an attractive car, especially with the top down. Some of the color combinations seem dubious to me, like a silver car with a blue top, but my friend liked that combination (which I&#146ve seen on other European convertibles). 

I also don&#146t care for the frilly styling of the optional ($500) &#147Cratos&#148 17-inch alloys.  I prefer the five-spoke alloys that used to be available. Currently the even more expensive $975 &#147Propus&#148 BBS-style alloys look the best to my eye. No matter which wheel is ordered, the tires are Pirelli P6000s, an all-season performance (but not ultra-high-performance) tire.

The interior borrows heavily from the old S70 (since replaced by the S60), but still looks good. Although the interior styling recalls Volvos of yore in its boxiness, materials are top notch and the feel of both surfaces and controls is very luxurious. Details appear very well thought out. 

For 2003, the LPT came with standard aluminum trim, with traditional dark wood part of the touring package optional on the LPT and standard on the HPT. Interior colors were silver, beige, and gray. For 2004 (which has already begun as far as Volvo is concerned), more interior choices are available. Either car is available with either of these trims, or with light-colored birchwood. (To get them in the LPT, the Touring Package must be purchased.) The new trim is available only with a fourth, new-for-2004 interior color, linen. Finally, new-for-2004 red seats are available with aluminum trim in the gray interior.

The C70 most exceeded my expectations in seating comfort. The large, well-bolstered front seats are extraordinarily comfortable yet still provide good lateral support. Rear seating tends to be poor in convertibles, yet I felt comfortable in this one. It&#146s roomy enough to fit one 5-9 person behind another. Rear shoulder room, as in other convertibles, is barely adequate for two people who like each other. 

The tall convertible top provides very generous headroom, so there is absolutely no chance of claustrophobia unlike in many two-seat roadsters. All in all, there seemed to be more stretch-out room front and rear in the C70 than in the competition from BMW and Saab.

Trunk space at eight cubic feet is less than two-thirds that of a S60 sedan, but good for a convertible. A BMW 3-Series has about the same. Unusual for a convertible, a pass-through is provided through the rear seat armrest. For skiing I imagine, as there will be no roof rack.

<b>On the Road</b>

The high-pressure turbo engine when paired with automatic moves the car very well, with passing at highway speeds particularly strong. A moderate amount of lag is present at moderate speeds, but the automatic&#146s torque converter helps mask it. Boost lag would be more of an issue if this was a hard core sports car, but it&#146s not. For more relaxed touring, clearly the car&#146s mission in life despite the option of 45-series low-profile tires, it does well. More of a concern is the five-cylinder engine&#146s innate soundtrack, which consists largely of groans. A BMW six feels better and sounds much sweeter.

Fuel economy is the same with either turbo: 18/25.

Handling is merely acceptable for this sort of car. The steering has a moderate amount of heft to it, which I like, but could provide more feedback. In fairly casual driving the chassis responds well and feels balanced. Push it, though, and this is clearly a nose-heavy front-driver. Understeer ramps up quickly. Bottom-line: if you&#146re not one to push a car hard (and my friend isn&#146t), you&#146ll have no issues in the handling department. If, on the other hand, you like to tackle curvy roads with gusto, there more than a small chance you won&#146t be happy here.

The largest weakness of the car is likely its structure, which does not feel nearly as stiff as that of a BMW. Some road surfaces created a barely audible boomy resonance in the body, something I&#146m more used to finding in SUVs and minivans. The body quivers a bit over various road imperfections, certainly less than in any American four-seat convertible I&#146ve sampled but more than in a BMW. The ride is fair to good in quality, which is better than I expected given the low-profile tires fitted to the car I drove. I did drive the car in Virgina; on Michigan&#146s nastier roads I might feel differently.

Wind buffeting is not bad at highway speeds, and can be further reduced by putting the windows up and installing the optional wind blocker over the rear seat. This is a convertible well-suited to travelling long distances. With the top up the top&#146s lining keeps wind noise down. It&#146s still louder than a coupe, but not by much. 

The optional ($600) 13-speaker, 400-watt Dolby Pro-Logic sound system is powerful enough to be heard clearly with the top down. This can be an issue in other convertibles. The HPT comes standard with the 400-watt amp, the LPT makes do with 240 watts, with the Pro Logic system a $1,200 option. A pair of subwoofers is a dealer-installed accessory.

<b>Safety</b>

The C70 is fitted with the same broad array of safety equipment fitted to the average big-buck European car these days. The structure might not be stiff enough to quell road impacts, but judging from the illustration in the brochure it has been designed well for safety, with some structural members unique to the convertible. As in other European four-seat convertibles, if a rollover is sensed the rear headrests pop up.

<b>Pricing</b>

The sticker price for 2003 seemed too high, nearly $49,000 when equipped like the car I drove (with the $500 wheels). Heavy $5,000 factory-to-dealer incentives brought the typical transaction price down by six grand, according to Edmunds. In a bid to reducee the incentives, the sticker price has been reduced by $4,245 for 2004 and the dealer cash to $3,000. So far, transaction prices are actually up by a couple grand if Edmunds is accurate, to about $41,500 for the $44,500 car I drove. (Note: Edmunds is less accurate early in the model year.) Add another $500 for the nicer wheels, deduct $500 for the standard wheels. This price is still a couple hundred under &#147invoice.&#148 Latter in the model year I&#146d expect discounts to grow, putting the C70 HPT with a few options into the high 30s and the base LPT into the mid-30s. 

A BMW 330Ci convertible equipped like the car I drove typically sells near its $46,000 sticker. An Audi A4 goes for a thousand or so under its $44,000 sticker. So the Volvo is cheaper than either, but not by so much that I&#146d expect anyone to buy it just to save a few bucks. Especially since the BMW will depreciate much less quickly. If you like what the Volvo offers, the price isn&#146t too bad, but otherwise it still seems high relative to the more up-to-date, better handling competition. 

<b>Last Words</b>

The C70&#146s strengths are styling, acceleration, comfort, and safety. In structural rigidity, engine refinement, and handling competitors have a significant edge. The average buyer of these cars, like my friend who came close to buying a C70 despite my initially low expectations, is more likely to notice the advantages.
