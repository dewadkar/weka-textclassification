            Hitting the curb at 10 mph is still enough to give you a quite a jolt. Trying to maneuver our 1991 Ford Explorer back home in an ice storm was no easy task, especially with the 4-wheel-drive-motor just having burnt out. It had only been a few weeks since we were going down a 10% grade highway and our front brake pad busted into pieces. And given that it was only running on 5 cylinders, we had finally reached the breaking point; the monthly repairs were costing more than the monthly loan payment. It was clearly time to get a different vehicle.

We had a clear goal for our new SUV. First we needed the "truck" features: 4-wheel drive, enough room to sleep in, skidplates, and ground clearance of at least 7 inches. Than we needed the "car" features: It needed a CD player, two cup holders in the front, and a V6, not a V8 (because gas isn't as cheap as it used to be).

Ford already had a tarnished quality image and the new tire-rollover problem on the news wasn't helping. The Nissan Pathfinder was nice, but felt like a car, had plastic skid plates, and had less power than a scooter. The 4-Runner was impressive, but so was its sticker and we weren't looking to take out a mortgage. The only vehicle that met our criteria was the 2nd generation Honda Passport and Isuzu Rodeo. We bought the Passport.

<b>The Ride</b>
The Passport has fit the bill perfectly. On the road, it is dead quiet, the most quiet of all our vehicles actually. Although upon acceleration, you'll know that you aren't in a car. The hood rattles at times, but it depends on the road and wind. This is a problem with the design and there isn't a whole lot that can be done about it, other than adding some felt padding. The 6-CD changer in the dash is very nice. I can go over a cattle-guard at 40 mph without a single skip. 

<b>The Interior</b>
Four cup holders (front and back), door pockets, storage console, comfortable seats (minus the vinyl "hole" headrests found in the older models), and interior grip handles for each seat round the interior of this SUV out very nicely. The push button 4-wheel drive is nice but the button is right next to the Cruise button - so take a look before punching a button at 70 mph!

Backseat passengers have been very complimentary... saying it is very roomy... specifically, we've heard that its better than the GMC Jimmy, Kia Sportage, and Jeep Cherokee. The backseats fold down flat and allow a surprising amount of room compared to other SUVs in the same class.

<b>Off-Road</b>
Now off-road. Without alot of wheel-well clearance, I wasn't sure how well we'd do in this thing. After nearly 2,000 off-road miles, I can say this wasn't an issue. Combined with off-road BFGoodrich tires, this vehicle has hauled us out of every bend we've put it in. The exhaust pipe is neatly tucked up near the bumper so there is no worry of stalling in a stream-crossing. The V6 had plenty of power to pull us up out of ravines and engaging the 4x4 just made things downright easy.

With proper tires, it has handled well on snow. On ice its a different matter. Ice, as well as very bumpy terrain, has a tendency to "freak out" the ABS system. The brakes feel as if they completely "go-out" (and sound like it to). But be confident that, even with the brake pedal thrusted to the floor, you will still have brakes and stopping-power. In fact, in normal city driving, I've found this vehicle to be able to stop at almost dangerous (read: whiplash) distances!

<b>Exterior</b>
The Passport comes with skidplates, the metal variety, and if you use your SUV for all its intended purposes, you'll grow to appreciate these additions. And if you're the type to change your own oil, know that the main skidplate snaps off within a minute to provide very nice access to the oil filter.

Most Passports, and some Isuzu Rodeos, come with the spare tire mounted on the back door. While this can make for awkward loading, having the glass open separately makes a big difference. The tire is mounted low enough that back-window vision isn't sacrificed when driving.

Tires are 16" and are fairly expensive to replace. So stay out of the "Power" transmission mode and conserve your rubber unless the cost doesn't outweigh the thrill of out-gunning the majority of other vehicles at the stoplight... our neighbor with a Rodeo says he can routinely beat Trans-Ams and Mustangs.

The engine is very quite and efficient - gaining nearly 21 highway miles to the gallon (17-18 city). Ours uses more oil than is normal but what's a $1.15 every two months?

Only problems we had were tied to a leak in the manifold gasket. An hour at the shop and it was back to new. 

A lot of online complaints you may read about this vehicle come from previous owners of cars such as Honda Civics and Accords. They complain of the ride, the gas mileage, the cornering. What they wanted was a tough-looking car. What they got was a civilized truck. Know if you buy a Passport, that you are getting a nice truck, not a car. If great gas mileage and great cornering stability are priorities, keep the car. Otherwise, this is a great ride.
