            I have had a Toyota Camry for the past 4 years (2 different ones) and I find it to be a very reliable car. I have had to give it basic maintanence and service but other then that I have never had any major problems. Both cars I had I got second hand and I liked them both very much. It is a large car - it can seat 5 pretty comfortably although the 3 in the back seat might be a bit tight. The trunk is very big and for big objects the back seat can be lowered so that items can extend from the trunk into the back seat. It drives smoothly and doesn't make a lot of noise. One of the downsides is the probability that it might be stolen - that is what happened to my first one - so an alarm is a must investment - but I still think it is worth it.<br><br>
