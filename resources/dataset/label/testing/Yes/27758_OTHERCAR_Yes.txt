   The camera is so simple and easy to use. What a great way to get into a digital cameras! Other camera seemed to bulky and ugly looking. This camera is so fun to use and good looking we bought a second one.

    When shopping for a Digital Camera the selection was rather dim. Low end cameras had a attractive price, but very dismal picture quality. Picture quality was important to me since the primary use of this camera was for online Auctions and documenting college projects. But the cost of a high end camera was bank breaking! The Canon attracted us since we already own the regular film Canon Elph. The ultra compact size was a huge buying point. Other camera felt bulky and cumbersome. Use this camera and it feels like a regular point and shoot.

     Picture quality can be adjusted depending on your needs. I can usually get a good "rolls" worth of film on the stock flash cards. 

     The camera has a very durable metal casing. the screen is small, but not too small. It feels perfect for the cameras mini size. 

     This camera is so simple to use that i didn't even look at the instructions for a few weeks of constent use. If you can work a point and shoot camera, you can use this Canon with ease. 

      The Canon comes with a handy little battery charger that is also small and compact. 

Negatives???

  well battery life is alittle bit on the short side. Reducing your battery consumption by turning of the LCD screen helps alot.

   The flash card they give you is far to small. A upgrade to 32 MB is well worth the extra money.
 
   Also invest in a Sandisk flashcard reader. It makes loading images on your computer very easy. Much easier then getting a bunch of wires and plugging in your computer.

   The compact size is nice when you carry it in your pocket, but remeber to watch out for those fingers. On occasion they do get in the way.  

   Buy this camera. You won't feel ripped off because it feels well built, its easy to use , complete lack of instruction reading, its a pretty piece of metal, the pictures are great quality, and It has a good midrange pricing. I dont know why people would want anything else?
