            I purchased a 1997 Dodge Intrepid two years ago and have not had any problems with it since. My Intrepid has a 3.3L V6 and automatic transmission. The 1997 Dodge Intrepid is the only year that Dodge perfected the Intrepid line. The 1993 to 1996 models had engine, suspension, and other problems frequently. The newer models have a new body style that gives much less interior room than the 1997 model. The newer models are also not as sharp as the 1997 Dodge Intrepid is.

The base model of the 1997 Dodge Intrepid comes with the following standard features. It has air conditioning and a rear window defroster. Power windows, power locks, and a cassette player are also standard. Standard tilt steering and cruise control make longs trip seem short. You can also opt for power seats, leather seats, a sunroof, and a cd player.

This car rides very smooth even at high speeds. The acceleration is excellent and so is the braking. The car is a 4 door sedan. It provides plenty of foot and head room in both, the front and the back of the car. Comfortable seats and superb air conditioning make long trips in the summer a breeze. The headlights provide superior lighting over any car I have ever driven. The bright lights light up the entire road. These headlights make night driving just as simple and easy as driving in the day.

The air conditioning on this car is so powerful that you never have to turn it on the highest setting. The heater and defroster are also very powerful. The defroster in this car can clear windows in less than a minute. The heater takes even less time to keep you warm on those cold mornings and nights. 

The engine and transmission both run strong. They are both well built. The worst thing about the engine is the position of the spark plugs. You have to remove your air filter assembly to change two of the six spark plugs. The engine provides both power and efficiency. This car gets over 20 miles per gallon. The transmission never hesitates to shift and never skips. The engine delivers nearly 200 horsepower.

I recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a reliable used car. It is perfect for the family, business, or even for a personal car. The car also has a spacious interior and a large trunk. The engine and transmission are dependable. On a scale of one to ten, I give it a ten!<br><br>
