            I don't care much about torque and horsepower.  In fact, I can't even explain what those terms mean!  I'll admit it straight out -- I bought a BMW because &quot;it's a BMW.&quot;  I had owned my beloved Acura Integra for eleven years, with few signs of wear and tear, when I got into an accident and the car was totaled.  This was my opportunity to go for the dream!

Having driven my BMW for more than a year now, here are my non-technical observations, good and bad:

<b>I. THE GOOD</b>

Here are some of the conveniences of the BMW, some of which I didn�t realize I wanted until I knew I had them!

<b>- A full-size spare</b>

I got a flat tire within months of purchasing this car.  Having AAA replace it with the full-sized spare gave me a little more piece of mind as I drove to the tire store for a new one.

<b>- Cool set of keys</b>

The car comes with four keys:
� The main key � press the BMW logo in the middle and a tiny little light comes on!
� A second key with no light.
� A spare key that�s thin enough to fit in a wallet, to be used in emergencies only.
� A valet key � you can drive with it, but you can�t open the glove compartment or trunk.

By the same token, you can lock the trunk in such a way that it is disconnected from the central locking system, meaning it stays unlocked even if you unlock a door.

<b>- Great exterior mirrors</b>

Not only are they electronically adjustable, but both mirrors are automatically heated when you put the key in the ignition � a major convenience on those really frosty-cold days!

<b>- Responsive windshield wipers</b>

The intermittent wipers that wipe faster as you drive faster, and stop when you�re at a stop.  Moreover, the windshield wiper jets are also automatically heated when you put the key in the ignition.

<b>- More status information than you could ever want</b>

A information display located below climate control informs you of: the current date and time, the outside temperature, and warnings, such as low on washer fluid or defective brake light.  (You can also separately purchase an onboard computer which will keep track of additional items such as average speed, distance remaining to destination, and average fuel consumption.)

There is also a �time for service� indicator on the dashboard that automatically tells you it�s time to take the car in for maintenance.

<b>- No visible antenna</b>

Which means it won�t get mangled if you forget to put it down before driving through the car wash.

<b>- Leave the car behind you IN THE DUST</b>

When you take your test drive, make sure to stop at a traffic light with someone behind you.  When the light turns green, put the pedal to the metal.  Notice how the car <i>really moves</i>!  (Okay, maybe I <i>do</i> care about horsepower a little.) 

By the way, the BMW 323is has 168 hp.

<b>- Some other things</b>
 
� Lighted vanity mirrors �- you'll feel like a movie star!
� A lighted trunk.
� An onboard toolkit (located underneath the trunk lid).
� Separate temperature controls for driver and front-seat passenger.
� Front and side airbags for front-seat passengers.
� Rubber strips on the trunk floor to keep luggage from slipping.
� A flashlight that recharges in the glove compartment.

<b>II. THE BAD</b>

Of course these are things that aren�t documented in the user manual, but discovered only through actual use�

<b>- A cupholder in the wrong place</b>

If you place both hands on the steering wheel, at 10 and 2 o'clock positions, the cup holder will be way behind your right elbow -- highly inconvenient (not to mention, dangerous) when you're driving and drinking coffee at the same time! [I have a 5-speed model; perhaps the cupholder is located in a different place on the automatic model.]

<b>- The 6-CD changer is nice, but I never use it</b>

I bought this option thinking I would use it all the time.  But I�ve discovered I�m just as content listening to FM radio!  I know a CD changer is a great feature when you�re taking a long road trip, but when you�re just commuting 10 miles to and from work every day, it�s not that big of a benefit.  Besides, it�s rather inconvenient to use: the changer is in the trunk of the car, and there�s no real storage for additional CDs, making it difficult to switch disks in and out.  On the BMW 2000 models, the 6-CD changer retails for $675; the in-dash single CD player (which replaces the cassette player) costs $200.

<b>- Front seats that don't go all the way down</b>

The 323is is a two-door coupe.  The front seats don�t fold forward all the way down, making it more difficult to get in the back seat.  Once you go to a dealership and try it yourself, you�ll see what I mean.

<b>- Doors that must swing all the way out</b>

My Integra�s doors would �lock� open at a fairly small angle �- in other words, I wouldn�t have to open the car door very far before it would stay put.  A BMW door, however, has to be opened very wide; otherwise, it will swing back the other way. I have been munched several times by a door that comes back to close on me because I did not open it wide enough.  <i>I hate this!</i>

<b>- Small trunk, small glove compartment</b>

This is not a car with a lot of storage capacity.  I used to be able to fit a mini flashlight, a bottle of sunscreen, the owner�s manual, and a small box of tissue in my Integra�s glove compartment.  My BMW glove compartment holds only the manual and the sunscreen.

<b>- You�ll see the �engine problem� light turn on within days of driving the car</b>

But don�t worry, your engine is probably fine.  The light goes on when you fill up the tank with gas and don�t tighten the gas cap all the way.  The BMW dealership says that�s the number one reason that the �engine problem� light turns on.

<b>III. ALL IN ALL</b>

Some of the conveniences listed here are purely &quot;icing on the cake,&quot; but they do contribute to the prestige of owing a BMW. And as for its several annoyances, I can grudgingly live with them.  Although I <i>do</i> wish for a better cupholder!
