            Bought my 2001 Elantra new and now have 38,000 miles on it.  I love the pep and handling.  Here in the Rocky Mountains, it is a dream on the back roads; taking tight turns as if it was made for them and giving me all the zoom I need in climbing steep mountain hills.  All that and 35 mpg.  Ok, I love it.

Problems I have had:

Stock tires wore out at 26,000 miles.  Put new, sport tires on it and the handling is great.

Keep having problems with passenger window sticking going down.  Dealer service department recommends silicon spray in rubber track, which probably is covering up a possible design flaw.

A leak in the trans-axial seal developed at 35,000 mile--fixed under warranty, of course.

2 "Fish-eye" paint flakes on trunk.  Dealer says that it is not a warranty problem.  Who knows.

I have checked resale and trade-in values both in the used car markets and on Ebay.  It's value has dropped far more rapidly than either the Corolla or the Civic.  It seems that the old Hyundai reputation is hanging over this model's head.  Folks, the 2001 Elantra is a real bargain in the used market.  I am considering buying a second used 2001 (or 2002) Elantra.
