            In August of 1998 I began to look into new vehicles that were 4X4 and had a decent carrying capacity as I moved around a lot and would be living in the snow 4/5 months of the year.  I looked at the RAV-4, the subaru SUVs, and several other cars.  The RAV-4 had four wheel drive engaged all the time and only had a 4 cylinder engine and little carrying capacity.  That didn't help me at all.  The subaru series seemed overpriced and there were few dealerships- I wanted to make sure there was many dealerships so that if anything happened I wouldn't have to go far to get it fixed. 
Then there was the Ford Explorer and the Blazer, my final choices.  From what I found out the body on the Blazer was made better so I went with them.  Also, they have a wonderful service called &quot;ChevUSA&quot;, its like AAA, but better.  Its a wonderful, wonderful service.  I was in an accident and had to have my car towed and even though they couldn't get there very quickly, they said they would pay the tow charge for another service to do it so I could have expident service AND THEY DID!  
I had flipped the SUV in the snow--there was very little body damage though and there wasn't a scratch on me.  After that accident I knew just how amazingly the body on the blazer was built.  That is the vehicle I want to be in if anything were to ever happen.  The sound system in the vehicle is amazing!  I have the 2 door '98 model fully loaded.  The features are unbeatable.  It came with the dual cd, cassette radio--it is set-up so uniquely and makes using it very easy.  I didn't have to update the speakers or anything and I get amazing sound.  
  I would have to say though that their are a few cons to the Blazer.  The molding on the door to my car does not stay on no matter what they try.  ANd if you live in a hilly/steep area the brakes do wear away quickly, but I guess that is true in most SUV's.  Also, some of the outer plastic pieces do crack easily, especially if you live in the cold.  
  Also, in the two door version the vision out of the back is really not good.  I will go for a four door when my lease runs up.

  Even though I have had some problems with my truck--its nothing that couldn't happen with any other vehicle out there and Chevy is quick at responding to problems.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS VECHILE (the four door over the two), especially if you have to fit alot in the car at one time.  <br><br>
