            I have a '00 ML320 Elegance (Build date October/'99), and like many others here, I believe that it is one of the best SUVs out there on the market. Yes, there have been some reliability problems, but if one takes a closer look, those opinions are mainly written by owners of '98 or '99 MLs. The MY2Ks are much improved and they are truly vehicles worthy of the MB name. The only problems that I've had so far have been a glovebox that rattled slightly over rough roads, and a rear window switch that had a sticky contact (it went down by itself<b> once</b>). Both problems were taken care of immediately and haven't reoccured since.

Something that many people don't know about the M-class is that it is available with an optional 3rd row seat. These seats bring the total passenger capacity to 7, similar to that of a minivan. Of course, there's not as much room as a minivan, but the extra two seats (they're full-sized with full head restraints and 3 point seatbelts) are convenient for a variety of situations.

Some of you may be interested to know that the M-class won the grueling 11,000 km (Year 2000) Paris-Dakar-Cairo Rally in the T1 Unmodified Production vehicle class. In fact the MLs came in 1st, 3rd and 10th in those categories. Extremely impressive for vehicles that were nearly in stock form, with the exception of a few safety modifications. It also goes to prove the strength/versatility/reliability of these vehicles in extremely tough conditions.

In any case, pictures of my '00 ML320 and of the Dakar MLs can be seen in my Photopoint album at: http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumList?u=137587

For those of you who wish to participate in a discussion group, feel free to pop by the M-class SUV topic in Edmunds Townhall (www.edmunds.com).
