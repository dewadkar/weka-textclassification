            I have a 1998 volvo S70 T-5, and its the best car that i have driven in a while.  It provides a spacious interior with plenty of leg room.  The seats are also very, very comfortable, I could drive in it all day.  The power of the engine is also very good.  Off the line, there isn't as much kick as i wanted, but when it gets going, the turbo kicks in and plants my head on the head rest, and the best thing is that it runs on REGULAR GAS.  It handles very well and braking is good because of firm pedal feel and the great stopping distance from 60-0.

I say that its a tank because the best thing about it is that safety is a key issue.  There is a passenger cage that the car is built around so if i gets in an accident, you will walk away from it.  There are also air bags in the front and the side in the seats so where ever the seat position is, it will protect you.  It has seat pretentioners too, which help reduce injuries by keeping you against the seat.  I love this car and comparing it to other cars i have driven, i would have to say that its the best.<br><br>
