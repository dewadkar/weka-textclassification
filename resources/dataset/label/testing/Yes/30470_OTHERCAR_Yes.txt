            The new Toyota Corolla is a class act. It is one of, if not the most dependable car on the road.
I recently checked into buying a new car and the one that kept making the top of the lists was the Toyota Corolla.
Its dependable, gas consumption is almost nil and it looks great too.
The price is between $11,000 and $16,000 depending on dealer, options and area that you live in.
If you have younger to school age children and/or one to three children, this is a comfortable car. It is considered a compact car and larger families would be packed in tight.
This is also a great first car for the teenager because of its size and low gas mileage. And they can't get twelve other teenagers in it!
This is also a dependable second car.
