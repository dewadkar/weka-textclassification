            I have been in love with the Ford Mustang,since I first owned a 1965 Mustang,which I purchased used when I got out of the U.S.Army in 1970.The ford Mustang was at the top of its class then and has remained there throughout the years.Other sporty cars have come and gone but the mustang lives on.I don't currently own one but my friend does and it makes you feel young just to ride in it.Here are some of my reasons why it is a good car and price.
  It is a beautiful car and comes in almost any color you want.Exterior colors are as follows.
some of them are Zinc yellow,sonic blue,satin silver, mineral grey, laser red tinted, true blue,torch red tinted,trpic green oxford white and of coarse black.

Interior colors too match or your choice.The sound system is a new Mp3 cd player that is a mach 1000 audio system.It features a 60 watt amp that powers four mid range tweeters.Six 85 watt sub woofer amps drive four  interior sub woofers.all in all, 1140 watts of peak power.It also comes with an optional in dash cd changer.

You can from a vast number of options to your vehicle.260 horses are ready to take you for the ride of your life.You have to  hold the reins tight until you get on the open road.
Ford offers a variety on finance plans from $1500.00 cash back to 0.0 apr for 36 months,2.9 for 48 months or 4.9 for 60 months.It has stylish interior with all the controls and instrument readings at your fingertips.If you want prestige,history,tradition and satisfaction you too can be a part of the mustang tradition.I have owned several over the years and have enjoyed them all.
Prices start from around $16000.00.
 It is ultra comfortable and quiet to have so much power.
When I was younger I use to wander whether the girls liked me or the fact that I had a fire engine red 3 speed black interior mustang.I still ask myself that same question.Go try one out for yourself.
