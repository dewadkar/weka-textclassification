            I think that the Ford Ranger is a nice little truck.  If you are looking for a good, dependable truck this is it.  My husband drives it to work and he likes it a lot.  I only have a 4-cylinder engine but it still gets the job done.  It has pretty good acceleration for a truck and isn't too bad to drive around town.  On the freeway I get about 26 MPG so fuel bills don't kill me.  Also since I only paid about 12,000 dollars for mine but it doesn't have any of the nice options such as A/C or power windows but if that doesn't bother you it is an excellent buy.

I don't think that you should buy this if you do a lot of heavy hauling.  This isn't a good truck for hauling big things such as boats but if you can afford a big boat you probably would want to buy something bigger and nicer.<br><br>
