            All I can tell you is how I feel about my 1992 Ford Explorer. My husband and I decided we needed a bigger car. So one day we sat down and made a list of all the possibilities. We weighed the pros and cons of each car. Eventually we agreed upon the Explorer. We eventually found one that was perfect for us. Sure it had fairly high miles but the owners babied it and it was in excellent condition. The price was right, only $6500.

Being a mother of a 13 month old I needed a fairly large car and <b>especially</b> a car with 4 doors. My Explorer is perfect for hauling around the baby and lugging the groceries. It's also wonderful to take out on those early Saturday mornings when I go to garage sales with friends. It fits all of us <b>and</b> all our stuff! Since I usually only drive around town, gas hasn't really been to bad either. I probably put in about $10 a week, which is about the same amount my husband puts in our Cavalier since he drives it to work. The only downside of this car is that it's a little noisy and the ride is a little rough. But that's great for soothing a baby to sleep!

I would recommend this car for parents with large families or possibly people who enjoy outdoor activities and need to haul equipment. I wouldn't suggest it for anyone who needs to drive long distances on a consistent basis.<br><br>
