            I bought this car as with the addition of a child, I did not want to deal with 2 doors instead of 4.  I had an awful time with my height (6'3") of fitting into a lot of 4 door sedans.  With my choices whittled down by comfort and price, I decided to go with the 2000 Buick Regal.

I generally have been fairly happy with the Regal.  It has a great air conditioner in that both the passenger and the driver can control the hot and cold temperatures for each side of the car.  Also, the interior is roomy enough for a tall person to drive it without your thigh hitting the steering wheel.  The car rides very nice as well especially on the interstate.  Another nice thing is the low tire warning light which will warn you when one tire goes 10 pounds of pressure lower than the other three.

The cons I would list are correctable.  First, the low coolant warning light has come on ever since I bought the car as the car leaks antifreeze.  I usually put about a 1/4 gallon in the car every 3 months.  Also, the factory tires are not the greatest as they are almost worn down at 50,000 miles.  The look of the car on the outside is nice although it seems like more of an older person's car which I am not.  

The mileage at this point I would call a push as it lists at 19/29 and I usually get about 21 miles per gallon with generally city driving.  The car has a lot of giddy up for when you do need to speed up and pass somebody.  

All in all, I have been fairly happy with the Regal.  It is not luxurious as my 1994 Ford Thunderbird which I traded in for this so there are some features I miss from that vehicle, but this has been a nice replacement.  Generally, I would advise someone to buy this vehicle.
