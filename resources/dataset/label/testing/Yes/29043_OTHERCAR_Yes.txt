            My parents bought a top of the line 2000 Honda CRV in July of 2000.  It comes w/ all the bells & whistles like leather interior, cruise, automatic, a back windsheild wiper, and everything else you can think of except maybe On-Star.  So far they havn't had any trouble w/ it.  Honda's seem to have a good reputation.  They have owned 3 or 4 in all.  I can't remember any of the Honda's giving any trouble.  This is a nice small SUV.  It's not a gas hog like the Suburban or any large SUV, yet it's not light and flimsy like a  Suzuki SUV or a Chevy Tracker, or an older Explorer.  It's stands up to wind pretty well and you don't feel as if you're driving a bus.  Parking and backing out is a breeze.  It has pretty good pickup when merging onto the freeway.  I'm currently driving this vehicle since my ride is in the shop and I can't really complain.  Honda did good w/ this little SUV.  The only thing that I think could be improved is rear visability.  When backing up, sometimes I notice that I have a hard time seeing over the headrests.  The body styling could have used a stronger or tougher look, but it's not bad.  My only complaint is that I wish it was a 4 wheel drive.  I'd love to take it out mudslinging, but I don't think mom & dad would appreciate that too much.  Overall it's a great ride for the price.
