            I loved my Polaroid PDC-640!  It was my second digital camera, I started out with a cheap internet deal on an off brand and could not get the thing to take a decent picture to save my live.  Then I found a deal on the PDC-640 and fell in love with digital photography!  This camera is a no brainer, it's ready to use right out of the box, and took thousands of great pictures in the year I used it.  I recently bought another camera and passed the PDC-640 on to my Mom who is still snapping away with no problem.  In fact, she is clogging up my email with daily pics of my nieces and nephews.  (Just Kidding!)  Thanks Mom!

The software set up is easy, the cables are easy, even for non-techies, and the pictures it takes are clear and bright.  I really like the LCD, so you can see the pic right away, and even though its a battery hog, I found that if I used the new batteries designed for digital products, I got about twice the battery life.  

Once you have taken the pictures, uploading them to the computer is fast and easy.  I found the software easy to use, though not full of features that a pro might like to have.  This is a sturdy camera, when you hold it you feel that, not like some of these over priced models that weigh less.  I want to feel that heft, it feels like quality to me.  Not too heavy though, it travels well, protected in the case it came with, and I never felt like it was cumbersome to bring along anywhere.

It takes great indoor flash pictures, and clear bright outdoor pictures.  The only problem I had was that the flash does not regenerate as fast as I would like.  We are only talking miliseconds though, I am quite impatient!  The interface on the LCD was easy to use.  I never once deleted a picture I wanted, and I liked that I could lock some pictures so that no one else accidentally deleted them, my son for example, who didn't want to take the time to upload the pictures on the camera before taking some more of his own!  The camera can store almost 100 pics on lesser quality, but only 12 on the best quality.  The 12 on best though, are very good, I was surprised it was only 640, as they were often clearer than those my friend took on her super 1400 camera.  This irritated her quite a bit!

For the money, and the deals out there right now on this camera, it's a winner in my book.
