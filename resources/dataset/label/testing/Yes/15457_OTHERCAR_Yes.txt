            Since we frequently need a camera at the middle school where I teach, we are especially happy to have an FD88. It provides an opportunity for immediate viewing to see if we have a &quot;good&quot; photo; we can easily delete and take additional photos if necessary at a one-time-only event.  The students are becoming adept at using the floppy disk in our computers, opening photos and doing minor editing, then inserting the photos into draw programs, adding captions, and printing.  The Epson 900 Stylus prints beautifully, making memorable keepsakes.   

In addition, we have used our personal FD88 with great results to supplement regular wedding photography.  We snap extra photos with the FD88 and provide the couple with a collage of photos from the wedding plus a photo of the special guest inserted on an 8-1/2x11 printed page. These are available the next day for the eager couple to share with guests; sometimes they accompany thank you notes, depending upon the bride's wishes.  A real hit made possible financially by the wonderful camera!<br><br>
