            I really enjoyed my Cavalier. I was single when I bought it. It was priced right and got great gas milage. About 300 miles to a tank. I had a sun roof and I loved it. The only problem is that it got stuck in the open position and i had to have it replaced. my radio had great quality.
I loved to take road trips due to the smooth ride. Very little noise got through. It was roomy enough for three to four women to fit in it. Someone over six fet tall would have problem with the leg room and head room. The trunk was average sized. But it got the job done. The seats were comfortable for road trips although the cloth was a little hard to clean.
i would recommend this for college students  or single people.<br><br>
