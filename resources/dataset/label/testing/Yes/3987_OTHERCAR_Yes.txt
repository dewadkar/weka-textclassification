            This is our 5th Saturn, and the 1st in the &quot;L&quot; series. When it was time to trade in our 1996 SC2, we thought about getting a Honda Accord LX.  While we had been happy with the Saturn, we felt we wanted something just a little bigger. We were all set to go to the Honda dealer when we got a mailer about the Saturn L.  We decided to stop buy the dealership. We never got to Honda.

The Saturn LS1 is in the middle of the &quot;L&quot; line.  The styling at first glance reminds you immediately of the SL series, so there is no doubt this is a Saturn.  That, however, is where the similarity ends.  This car was designed to go head to head with the Accord, and it shows.  Driving it has the feel of a &quot;foreign&quot; rather than &quot;domestic&quot; car.  Those words merely describe design choices that are made by the manufacturer.  In the case of the Saturn, what I mean is that there is attention to detail, the ride is smooth and quiet, and switches and other control have a positive feel to them.

The 4 cylinder engine has enough power to safely merge with traffic on the interstate.  If you needed something even more powerful, you can get the 6 cylinder version in the LS2.

If you were thinking about buying an Accord (which is an excellent car), stop by the Saturn dealer for a test drive of the LS1 first.  The worst you would lose is an hour of your time.  The best thing is you might find yourself with an excellent car for less than what you thought you would have to pay.
