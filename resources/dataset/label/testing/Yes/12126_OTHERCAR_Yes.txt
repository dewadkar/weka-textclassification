            I have been looking for a new car for awhile now.  I wanted to wait until September or later to take advantage of lower prices.  But I couldn't resist when I saw the 2000 Mazda 626 LX V-6.  Plus, I received a $2000 rebate.  I heard so many good things from friends and co-workers... and they were right!!  It is a V-6 5-speed.  It is dark green and has very nice rims with beige upholstery.

What I like:
1) Drive - This car accelerates beautifully!!  It rides smooth and is quiet.  Of course a V-6 helps, but the quietness of the engine surprised me.  The way the car drives and handles is the biggest reason why I like this car!!

2) Air Conditioner - It oscillates (moves back and forth across car).  A neat feature, although not necessary.  It blows out cold and doesn't take awhile to get cold.  The defrost on back window works great.

3) Radio/CD player/cassette - It came with all 3, although the cassette player was extra.  I like having the options when it comes to music.  The sound is very nice too.

4) Trunk space - A lot.  I am a seller on E-Bay and use the trunk all the time for packages.  There is a lot of room and even a little pocket where an item can be stored and not move around the trunk on every turn.

5) Inside - The seats are very comfortable.  It has 2 cup holders which have covers on them so they aren't exposed when not used.  The front arm rest has 2 compartments.  One for small items such as envelopes, pens, a bottle of cologne or whatever.  The one underneath is big enough for CD's and bigger items than the top compartment.  There is also an adaptor in there for charging your phone.  This way, the dash adaptor can be used for whatever else.  The back has a fold down arm rest.  It can be opened while down to expose 2 cup holders and another compartment.  There is also a lot of head room.

6) The look - The car looks great.  Smooth with no "square" corners.  It looks different from previous models, including the '99's.  There aren't any Mazda metallic emblems on sides, which I like.  It's on the back and nowhere else.  I hate feeling like I am paying a car manufacturer to advertise their products.

Dislikes:

1) I have had to take the car in twice to have a belt fixed.  Although annoying, at least it's not the engine, something involving the steering, or anything else major.  I don't consider this a visit to the shop and the reason being, we bought a 2000 Neon and had to take it in for engine problems, sometimes being held for days and a week even.  That's what I consider a "visit". 
***(6/7/00 update: This was my mistake!  I told them the belts squeaked when I turned on the car.  Actually, it squeaked when the A/C was on.  They replaced all the belts as a precaution.  Everything is great!)

2) Fuel usage - It's a V-6, so I use more gas than I use to.  I had a '95 Neon before, so I was use to filling up about once every 6-7 days.  Now it's once every 4-5 days.  I have a "lead foot" too.  I also think I may be taking advantage of the acceleration a little too much right now.

I don't want to end a positive opinion on a negative note, so I will close on this; This car drives smooth, looks smooth, and the inside is great.  Overall, this car is comparable to a Maxima, Camry, or any other non-luxury class top of the line car.  It's price was great too.

Update: 7/21/01 - I thought I'd let everyone know that I still love the car.  People still ask about it and want to take a look at it, inside and out.  I have had no problems with the car.  I would still recommend the car to anybody!!

This is my first E-pinion!  If you could rate this, I would appreciate it.
