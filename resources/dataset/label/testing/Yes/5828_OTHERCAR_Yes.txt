            We bought our Passat in December 1995 after seeing it at an auto show.  We bought the GLX with the V6 engine and every available option, including leather and sunroof.

This is a very nice car for the moderate $24,000 price tag.  The car has plenty of power and handles like a dream.  The seats are firm and comfortable for even long road trips.  The inside of the vehicle is designed in such a way that all the controls are easily reached.

For those of you who remember the old VW - it's time to look again.  VW had come a long way and they are now competitive with the like of BMW and Mercedes at a fraction of the price.  Though I have never driven the newer one, I would bet the new Jetta's are also of top quality.<br><br>
