            I would definately recommend the Pontiac Sunfire because I have had mine for 6 months and I really enjoy it.  It's not too big and it isn;t too small.  It is really affordable and since I am only 18 years old, I was to get real cheap payments too!  The drive is really smooth and all of my friends like it to.  I get really good gas milage which is good because I am always running around the place.  I bought mine in January, brand new (2000).  The dealership was friendly and I am glad I have my Sunfire.  I know I will keep it for a long time.  If you are out on the market for a new car, please email me and I would love to tell you more about mine!n
