            Once you've had a truck, you wonder how you ever lived without one.  But truck ownership means you give up comfortable riding for anything over two passengers, or you sacrificed cargo capability with a puny bed because you wanted the 4 door version.  Then came the Avalanche.

I purchased the '04 Avalanche about 2 months ago and love it.  I've put 4,000 miles on it and the motor is just now starting to loosen up, giving me plenty of horsepower.  It seats 6, has a ton of features for the base model, and can easily convert into a truck with an 8 ft. bed.  I've hauled many things in it, including a 10 ft. extension ladder.  I chose the base model without the Mad Max plastic.  I chose Dark Gray because it matches the black plastic bed very well.  The truck, without the plastic cladding, comes with chrome truck bumpers, which I like better than the plastic covered ones.  Base features include an electric driver's seat (I could care less if my passenger has to manually adjust her seat), power windows, power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, CD player, auto dimming mirror, electronic compass and temp, auto sensing passenger airbag, tow package (already wired for trailering), a cargo light inside the bed, nice aluminum wheels (16", don't really see the need for the more expensive 17" option),fog lights that really work (super bright), dual zone climate control, a roof rack, and a 290 hp motor that runs on regular unleaded. The bed is plastic with a thick rubber mat.  It has four tie downs in it.  I really like the locking storage bins on the side of the bed and the fact that the tailgate locks. Now for the best part - the price was $24,300. It rides smooth, has virtually no wind noise, and is comfortable.  I get tons of compliments on it - it really is a nice vehicle.  I don't track the gas mileage, but I would guess that it's about 17 mpg.  Since I do my own vehicle maintenance, access around the motor is important.  I can easily get to all 8 spark plugs on this one, look at some of the other makes and you'll see that half the motor's tucked under the dash.

The only complaint I have is with the cheap carpeted floor mats.  I've already worn a spot through where my left foot rests.  Also, the view out of the rear glass is limited, but if that's a problem, buy an AMC Pacer instead of an Avalanche.
