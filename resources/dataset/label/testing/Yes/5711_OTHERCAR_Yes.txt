               I can honestly say that my 1994 Acura Integra is the best car that I have ever driven. I bought it used and have owned it for 3 years, and in that time period I have not had a single problem with it.This is the first car I have owned where I have felt complete confidence taking it on road trips (which I take a lot of). It also handles great. 
   The only thing about it that some people might not like is that if you are going 80 miles an hour, you feel like your going 80. My mom has a Nissan Maxima, and when I drive it I can be going 100 down the highway and not even realize it, but with my Integra I can really feel the road. I prefer a car like that though because it gives me a sense of security. It also makes driving more fun. So if your looking for a car that looks sporty, is dependable, gets great gas mileage(it costs $11 to fill my tank, and that will usually last me 2 weeks if I'm not taking a trip), and will lower your car insurance(mine is lower now than when I had a four door sedan) than this is the car for you.<br><br>
