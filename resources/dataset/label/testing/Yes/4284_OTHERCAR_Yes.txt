            As the ex-owner of a 1971 Bug, I must say it is exciting to see another incarnation of the beloved Beetle on the roads of America again (even though we still call them Voolks-Wagons instead of Fulks-Vaagens).  A comparison between the Beetle of yore and the New Beetle of today:

Alt (Old) Beetle:

o  Non-functional heater that teased the owner with occasional hints of heat but never managed to thaw the driver�s feet or defrost the windshield.  V-Dub drivers back then did a lot of windshield scraping on the inside while driving - the resulting indoor snow storm reminded me of those little snow paperweights after you gave them the quick 180.  Many VW drivers walked with a slight stoop from the hours spent hunched over trying to see out the bottom 2 inches of the windshield that the defroster could clear off.

o  Windshield washer powered by air pressure of spare tire.  You overinflated it a tad and then hoped the shutoff valve worked OK when you used the washer.  When it worked, the stream rapidly shrank from a gushing torrent to a pathetic piddling stream that couldn�t moisten a gnat�s remains enough allow the wipers to remove them.  When it didn�t work, you had a long walk if you had a flat.

o  Bullet-proof motor that would run flat-out (72 mph) all day long, with a reassuring sound that was part Porsche flat four and part halftrack transporting Rommel through the dunes of N. Africa.  My Bug started its working life grinding through several NoDak winters during my brief and undistinguished �tour�with the Air Farce, sans block heater, and never failed to start even after sitting several days in -30 degree weather.  The original battery, a cheap-looking number, lasted 11 years before giving up the ghost. Its successor, an macho-looking American-made model, lasted 5.

o  Nearly bulletproof transmission (hey, the engine didn�t stress it that much!) that occasionally had the habit of slipping out of (mostly fourth) gear.  You knew when you were sitting in one so afflicted because the owner always had a little rope tether to hold it in fourth, or asked the person riding shotgun to do the honors.  Achilles Heel: the CV joints on the drive half-shafts, which usually would operate in dying mode for many thousands of miles, knocking at every turn, until finally pooping out.

o  The interior savoir faire of a tank.  You knew (usually) how fast you were going and whether you had good oil pressure or not, and that was about it for instrumentation.  Natty plastic seat covers froze your buns (see heater above) in the winter and toasted them in the summer.  Front seats slid fore and aft on skimpy floor rails which had a tendency to fall apart if you were rear-ended.

o  Mechanical simplicity throughout that encouraged a lot of doing it yourself.  Most hated job: changing the muffler, which tended to rust onto its pipes in a most tenacious fashion.  Most rust-prone: puny running boards and front of rear fenders.

o  Design which encouraged lots of owner modifications, like the Baja variants et. al.  My favorite: the rare �pickup� fashioned by eliminating the rear seat in favor of a short flatbed.

o  Sat four, but the two in back needed to be good friends.

o  Cost under $2200 brand new.

o  Relatively staid advertising.  My off-road favorite:  National Lampoon�s ad showing a Beetle floating in a lake with a caption to the effect that if Ted Kennedy had been driving a Bug, he wouldn�t have had his little Chappaquidick adventure.


Neu (New) Beetle:

o  Styled impressively like its predecessor, with a front/back symmetry that makes you wonder at first glance which end is the front.  (I know, the one with the headlights...)  Nice original color set, as well as cleverly advertised Web-available limited color options.

o  A heckuva lot more horsepower (up to 150, as opposed to my Bug�s nominal 60), more comely aero design (top of the line models supposedly can top 130), and ABS (Already Been Slammed) brakes.
 
o  Still seats four but in relatively opulent fashion (tinted glass! heated seats!)

o  Sports dashboard bud vase.  Personally, I prefer Heineken but this works too.

o   Cost has jumped up obscenely so you really need to like the car to shell out this kind of beans for it.

o  Vastly improved advertising, made affordable by the increased sticker price.  Reverse engineered from UFOs, Drivers Wanted, etc.
