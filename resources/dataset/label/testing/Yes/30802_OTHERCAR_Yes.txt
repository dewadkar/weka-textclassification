            I was new to Digital Photography and wanted a good quality camera without all of the hassle of spending my entire checking account.  The olympus D-340R was an excellent choice.  At just below $300 this camera takes excellent shots.  It is a true point and shoot digital camera but with the flexibility of taking multiple shots with the hold of the button.  It has digital Zoom capabilities (truly a difference between digital zoom and an actually zoom lense)that can make your subject appear closer than it actually is.  Use this feature rarely.  But the bottom line is good quality digital pictures.  That is because of the 1.2 megapixels this camera offers (usually in more expensive cameras).  The draw back is it does not download using a USB port.  Serial port capabilities is the only way to transfer from camera to computer.  This is a slow process, especially when the resolution is increased.  First time users will love this, also it is a great camera for vacations.  Stop buying the disposals and get a Olympus D-340R digital camera.  If you are a advance photographer or need more control over your snap shots, this camera is not for you.  But at $299 and it capabilities for good digital photos, you will not go wrong.<br><br>
