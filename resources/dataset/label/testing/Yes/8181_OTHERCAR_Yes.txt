            Within the field of automobile design, Audi is widely regarded as the leader. It is not hard to see why. While the A4 and the new TT get more attention, my personal favorite design is the A6. Over the past few years I have driven all four quattro varieties of the A6 sedan: the standard car, the 2.7T with both manual and automatic, and the 4.2. With this review I am finally getting around to fulfilling my longstanding intention of combining my separate reviews of these models. Though only my second test drive of a 2.7T manual was performed in a 2001 car, the others have not changed to any significant extent, so my experiences with them are still relevant to the current model year. Each of these models has a distinctive character, with its attendant strengths and weaknesses, so anyone attracted by the design of the A6 should have a clear idea of their needs and wants to ensure that they get a car they will be most satisfied with.

<b>Styling and Accommodations</b>

The strongest attribute of any A6 is its exterior design. The A6 has more distinctive styling than any other luxury sedan. The runner up would be the Lexus GS, but the C-pillars and rear quarters that make the GS distinctive also make it unattractive to my eye. The A6, in contrast, manages to be both distinctive and attractive. (The Infiniti J30 was also both distinctive and attractive, if a touch too round, but its lack of passenger and cargo space killed it.) 

The exterior styling of the A6 is not without some faults. Largely because the A6 is a fairly tall sedan, it looks a bit thick from some angles, especially over the rear wheel. Also, the fact that the engines in Audi sedans sit entirely forward of the front axle forces these cars to have unfashionably long front overhangs. The styling trend for some time now has been to push the wheels to the corners of the car, lengthening the wheelbase and shortening the overhangs. The A6 is a bit behind the curve on this dimension. Finally, the very large reverse light and reflector assembly around the rear license plate has always looked awful to my eye, especially with darker colors that make this feature stand out.

In the end, though, none of these faults can take away the essential distinctiveness and beauty of the design. The A6 manages to look unlike anything else on the road without being ugly. This design has been on the road for a few years now, so it might not seem as startling as it once did, but I can still remember my initial amazement when I first saw the car in person a few months before its introduction at an auto show. It was, and largely still is, striking.

Anyone who does not like the design of the A6 can cross Audi off of their list for a while. The A6�s design also represents the future for all Audi sedans. For 2002 and 2003, respectively, the A4 and A8 are being redesigned to look much like the A6.

The 4.2 has a slightly different body than the others, with a lowered stance and strongly flared fenders to allow for wider wheels. The look is a definite improvement on an already fine basic design. I suspect some people will spend the extra cash for the 4.2 for the looks alone.

Audis are not only attractive on the outside. While their interiors are more conventionally styled, they are at least as attractive as the exteriors. Everything flows together seamlessly. The wood and leather have the look and feel of top quality materials. No matter what your taste in interior decor, you should be able to find it here, since Audi offers a choice of three "atmospheres."

The interior also abounds with nice touches. While other German car companies have balked at "American" touches like cupholders, the A6 has some of the nicest in the business. The ones in the rear seat are particularly clever--they pop out of the forward edge of the seat cushion. 

At least I used to think this was clever. Another reviewer at Epinions points out that this location makes it easy for people, especially children, to step on the cupholders and break them off. People with children might want to be very careful when using the rear cupholders, or avoid doing so at all.

The A6 is very roomy inside. All outboard seating positions are very comfortable, at least for normal driving. The cushions are firm, as in any German sedan, but supportive in the right places. For aggressive driving, the front seats could be more supportive. They are so firm you tend to sit on them rather than in them, and the side bolstering is rather weak. The sport seats, not in any of the cars I drove, should at least partially fix this problem. This problem also seemed reduced with the Ambiance "atmosphere." The leather of this trim set is softer, allowing you to sink into the seat a little. Though I prefer the appearance of the other trim packages, with their highly textured leathers, this one is the most comfortable.

My largest complaint about the A6�s interior is that the beltline (lower edge of the windows) is fairly high. This makes the car feel somewhat closed in. I personally prefer a lower beltline for an airier feel and better visibility. Most significantly, I like to feel connected to the road when I drive, and a high beltline tends to envelop the driver in the car, cutting him or her off from what is going on where the rubber hits the road. In short, I strongly believe that a high beltline is fitting for a luxury sedan, but not for a driver�s car. Raising the standard power seat helps a bit, but I�d still rather have a lower beltline.

Audi is clearly aiming the 4.2 at a higher price bracket. The tilt and telescope feature is power, while it is manual on the other A6's. And the rear seat is a different design, with quasi-buckets carved out for the two outboard passengers and no center headrest. Better for two back there, worse for three.

The trunk is also quite large and usefully shaped. For still more cargo capacity, the rear seat folds down. 

<b>On the Road</b>

Unfortunately, driving the standard A6, the 2.8, is not nearly as exciting as looking at it. The A6 Quattro is a heavy car, in part because of the AWD system. 200hp moves it adequately, but it isn't going to get the adrenaline pumping. Especially not from a dead stop. If you care about acceleration at all, then I�d strongly suggest digging up the extra $5k or so for the 2.7T.

This might change a bit in 2002. The new A4 gets a larger six, a 3.0 liter, and the A6 probably will as well. The additional twenty horsepower should help move the standard sedan better. Still, much more power is necessary to make this an exciting car to drive. 

Why do I say this? I once owned an all-wheel-drive Toyota Celica. The A6 2.8 Quattro reminded me of the pluses and minuses of such a set-up. Traction in poor weather is unbeatable. Having all four wheels transmitting power adds a measure of safety in all conditions, since getting on and off the power affects both ends of the car equally. It is hard to upset the balance of such a chassis. The downside is that the chassis is so balanced that tossing it around is not much fun. It goes where you point it, but transmits little thrill in doing so. Perhaps for similar reason, the steering also feels a bit dead. In short, the downside is much the same as the upside. You won't upset this chassis when you don't want to, nor when you want to. My Toyota only became fun when there was snow on the ground or the road was unpaved and I could get the tail to step out a little. The road up to Pike's Peak was a real trip in that car. But most driving is not done on such roads. The A6 is much the same way.

At the top of the line, the 4.2 has a 300 horsepower V8. Based on numbers alone, this should be the most exciting A6. I also looked forward to driving the 4.2 because the Audi six is neither the smoothest nor the sweetest sounding. You hear mainly exhaust, and quite a bit of it when the throttle is done. You hear few sweet mechanical noises. These sounds are not objectionable, they just lack the intoxicating, encouraging quality of the better sounding engines found in many competitors.

My actual experience of the 4.2 was mixed. The 4.2 is definitely smoother, quieter, and better sounding than the others, but is still not quite where I'd want it. It's on par with the BMW eight, but not the Lexus eight, in this department. Think slightly mechanical, with none of the burble of American eights, but none of the intoxicating sounds a Lexus eight is capable of either.

Audi states that the acceleration of this engine is about the same as the 250 horsepower 2.7 auto. Where did the 50 extra horsepower go? I'd guess extra weight, taller gearing, and a higher torque peak. While the 2.7T thrusts you back into the seat immediately, the 4.2 takes a bit more time building up momentum. It's most probably quicker at high speeds, but this is America, not the Autobahn.

The transmission in the 4.2 also responds less quickly than that in the 2.7. I'd guess that fuel economy is the reason. Both cars are rated 17/24 by the EPA. Audi had to do something to the 4.2 to get it to match the 2.7 here. Something like taller gearing and a lazier tranny. Both take something away from the driving experience.

The upshot is that the 4.2, despite the lowered stance, aggressively flared fenders, and fat tires, is much more a touring sedan than a performance sedan. In terms of BMWs, it�s more seven than five. 

By process of elimination, 2.7T is the most exciting A6 to drive. The turbos transform the car far more than two extra cylinders could. Due to it's low, low torque peak, at 1850 rpm, the 2.7 liter turbocharged six thrusts you back into the seat and holds you there. Power builds much more quickly than with the 4.2. Thankfully, turbo lag is minimal. Feels nice.

The manual 2.7T is faster still, by about a half a second to sixty. Despite the additional quickness, I was disappointed in this version of the A6. In the first example I drove, the clutch engaged near the top of its travel, making clean shifts at full throttle very difficult. The engine is so powerful and winds so quickly that a quick shift is necessary to shift at the redline and still avoid the rev limiter. I banged the rev limiter a number of times.

A commenter to my original review took exception to my evaluation, and following some emails back and forth informed me that clutch tuning tends to vary quite a bit from car to car with Audis. So I drove a second car, and its clutch, though still possessing an overly long travel, was much more agreeable. 

Based on this experience, I�d suggest that anyone purchasing a manual A4 or A6, or a VW Passat for that matter (they all share the same basic transmission and clutch assembly), pay close attention to the adjustment of the clutch. If it engages too high, have the dealer adjust it. If the dealer is unable to make much of a difference, I�d ask for a different car.

Even with a better clutch, I still didn�t feel the manual transmission made sense in the A6. Audi shifters are among the worst. The one in the 2.7Ts I drove were fairly floppy affairs, where the travel felt a bit long and the length of the arm too short relative to the travel. I�ve been informed that a short shift kit is available from aftermarket suppliers to at least partially fix this problem. Definitely a worthwhile purchase if you�re set on a manual A4 or A6, or a Passat for that matter. (The TT is VW-based, with a different transmission and shifter. Still not the best shifter, but not as bad as the real Audi units.)

The driving position, discussed earlier, was also part of the problem. Compared to the S4, which has the same engine, the dash and door sills are higher and further away in the A6, making you feel a bit isolated from what you're making the car do. With the S4 you're right there, here you're a touch distant. I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't steer with my left hand and comfortably rest my elbow on the left armrest--it's too far away for this 5'9" driver. Overall, this driving position kept me from feeling directly connected to what the car was doing. 

The standard suspension tuning was an even larger problem. In normal driving, the ride feels firm but composed, a bit softer than that in a BMW but overall much like other German luxury sedans. You'll feel many small road imperfections but the car will remain quite stable over the bigger ones. This ride suggests taut handling.
Unfortunately, this was not the case. When driven aggressively, the standard suspension began to feel flabby, and the harder it was pushed the flabbier it became. In hard driving body lean was considerable. I suddenly understood why BMW fans sometimes refer to Audis as German Buicks. 

Most disconcerting of all, the 2.7T felt tippy off center. I suspect this was due to a combination of quick steering, a relatively high center of gravity, and a relatively soft suspension. Due to the combination of these issues, the manual transmission just did not feel right to me in the 2.7Ts I drove. To me, a manual transmission in an expensive sedan is about aggressive driving, and the A6�s standard suspension and seats are simply not meant for this task. 

The unique suspension of the 4.2 fixes these problems to a great extent. The 4.2 rides lower on a wider track. It also has firmer suspension settings, and the steering may also be geared differently. Whatever the reason, the 4.2 is the most stable handler of the bunch. 

I drove a 4.2 with the $750 big tire option--255/45-17's to be precise. The fenders are flared wider to clear these puppies. And they look nice. What do the extra 40mm's do on the road? Well, this sucker sticks. I carved up a church parking lot pretty well, probably going through at least $25 of pricey rubber, and it never quite came unglued no matter what I did with the throttle and steering. But then the 215's on the 2.7 did nearly as well. So I'd say that in anything approaching normal driving the 215's are sufficient--not a reason to dis the 2.7, anyway.

The 4.2 has more shock damping, it sits 0.4 inches lower, the track is 1.4 inches wider, and it's a couple hundred pounds heavier. As a result, the ride in the 4.2 is a bit more composed, despite the lower profile tires. Ditto for the handling. This car lacks the tippiness I perceived in the 2.7. So in the area of ride and handling the 4.2 is the best A6.

The optional sport suspension on the 2.7T should provide some of these benefits, in addition to providing a more heavily bolstered seat. The tires are the same size as those on the standard car, but they are a higher performance design. The downside is that these tires are not all season, which is why none of the Detroit area dealers stocks cars with this package. For those interested in the 2.7T, I strongly recommend this option, even though I have not tested it. If you live in a snowy area, get some Blizzaks.

An even better option would be the 2.7T engine with the 4.2�s body and suspension. Audi should consider offering this combination, much like Porsche has often offered the Turbo body with the regular 911. The 4.2 costs about $6k more than the 2.7T. So the body and suspension alone would probably be a $2-3k option. I suspect many 2.7T buyers would go for it. This would be the ideal A6 in my mind.

Even with the Sport Package, I suspect that an automatic transmission is still more in line with the character of the 2.7T. The transmission upshifts smoothly and downshifts readily, contributing to a responsive powertrain. I tried out the Tiptronic feature, where you shift it yourself. Though my own car is a manual, I did not find the use of this feature intuitive. I had to think too hard about when to upshift and downshift. Also, what I really like about a good manual is you feel like you're shifting gears. This isn't the case with any of the manumatics I've tried. With them it's just like moving a switch, which is what it is after all. So I'd personally just leave the thing in D most of the time.

If you want a truly exciting ride, one where you feel wired in to the engine and chassis, and you like the general look and ambiance of an Audi, I�d suggest going with the S4, which uses the same engine in the smaller, airier A4 body.

<b>Last Words</b>

The A6 2.8 is purely a stylish luxury sedan. The engine is s bit underpowered, and the standard suspension becomes flabby in aggressive driving. 

The 4.2 has more aggressive yet still very tasteful styling, but is generally an Autobahn cruiser in character, meant for covering distance quickly rather than tackling the twisties. This is easily the most luxurious A6. But it still lacks the luxury feel of a Lexus somehow. It doesn't have the liquid moves of an LS400, or even a GS400, perhaps because it wasn't meant to. It�s much more of a BMW 740 competitor, and should be most strongly considered by people also considering that car. But if you want a more mechanical feeling car, and don't desire the ultimate in refinement, then why not go with the 2.7 and save a few bucks?

For the driving enthusiast, the 2.7T is the best bet. With a very low torque peak, it is the most exciting to drive of the bunch. Still, the manual transmission remains a bit out of character, and I recommend the Sport Package for anyone who desires taut handling and a seat with lateral support. The automatic suits the turbocharged engine well, and with the Sport Package should make for a great looking, exciting to drive luxury sedan. I�ve given the line overall four stars, because each model has strengths and weaknesses, but this model may warrant five. If it was available with the 4.2�s body and suspension, it would definitely be a five.

For those desiring the ultimate in driving excitement, the best bet is probably the smaller S4. Or we might pray that Audi gives the S treatment to the A6. In Audi parlance, �S� denotes the performance model. That neither the 2.7T nor the 4.2 has not been given the �S� moniker suggests that Audi has something more powerful up its sleeve. Hopefully it is not too long before we see it.
