            The Mazda MPV, is a wonderful van, for a young family that cannot afford a new van.  It runs well for such an old car, and just keeps going, with out any major repairs.   The seats are still comfortable and are easily removed/moveable to for more space in the trunk.   The sound system is very good for it's age.   Our Van still has all of it's original systems, except for the odometer.   The odometer could not handle turing over 100,000, so we had to get it replaced, but since it was a glitch, something we could not control.  Mazda, gladly replaced it for free, along with checking the rest of the van without problems/cost to us.  We really loved working with the Mazda company, they are both warm and friendly and treat you with respect.
