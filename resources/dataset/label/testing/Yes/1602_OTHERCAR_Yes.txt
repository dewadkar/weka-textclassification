            I bought mine when it was the GEO Prizm, not the Chevrolet Prizm, but I think it's pretty much the same car. Chevvy owned Geo back then, and put Toyota engines in all of their cars. As far as I'm concerned, that was a great system. I know you're probably not going to rush out and buy a 93 Geo, but having seven years experience with this car, I think I can say something about its reliability record that will be of great value.

I bought this car because I needed economy transportation. Sadly, the RX-7 I'd driven for years was dying, and I reluctantly began looking at tercels, civics, etc. I actually bought an entry-level Saturn and had to take them up on their 30-day money-back guarantee because it was such a sluggish little mushroom of a car.

Enter the Geo. The 93 Geo Prizm I bought had 4 doors, over 100 horsepower, great mileage, and a sticker price of about $13K. I figured that was well-rounded, and the test drive went well. Mind you, I was looking for something that had more power than the Saturn. I was reasonably pleased with the Geo.

Getting it out the door was the usual salesman hassle. Thank god my Dad was with me to manage that (Saturn does have its advantages), but since then I've been just driving and driving with almost ZERO PROBLEMS.

I took the car in for 2 recalls, one relating to the seat belts, and found no trouble both times. I've never had cause to repair any major or minor system in this car. I've kept the oil changes regular, the tires in good shape, the wipers fresh, and all the rest has been cake. Aside from predictable stuff like the brake pads wearing out, NOTHING HAS GONE WRONG. All I could mention is that the knob controlling the air conditioning came loose. I keep it handy in the ashtray and can still use it to make adjustments.

The Geo handled Death Valley with no problem. The Geo handled the rains of Portland with no problem. I've taken the Geo across 6 states and back with no problem. This is an incredibly reliable car and has served me well in all regards. Every now and then I think of selling it to get something sportier, but you just can't knock a good thing. Once I looked at some auto classified to get an idea of what I could sell for... SURPRISE!!! There were NO used Geo Prizms listed for sale. What does that say?

This base-model Prizm has basically got everything I need. The windows all roll down, you don't have to hold the handle when you close the door, it's got AC and five gears. It's peppy enough to get me around; I'm almost never stuck because the car's got no pickup. It's roomy for four easily, and five can be done also. I've probably tried seven a few times. The trunk is big enough for two backpacking rigs and some firewood. The interior is ok, good styling, decent upholstery. The mileage has been about 30 city, 35 highway. It's got a 10-gallon tank and a range of 300-350 miles. I installed a CD player which has a built-in 25Wx4 amplifier and lo and behold: the factory speakers now sound about 100% better.

If your girlfriend thinks you need a rear spoiler and titanium wheels, get yourself something else. If you think you'll need to get around for the next 10 years and don't have a lot to spend, you can't go wrong with one of these.
