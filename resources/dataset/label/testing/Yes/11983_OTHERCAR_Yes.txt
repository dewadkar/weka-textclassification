            Me and the wife were shopping for a new car late last year.  She's got a '95 Saturn SL2 and I've got a '95 Volkswagon Corrado.  We've got 2 kids now and the Saturn tuned into the 'mom taxi' and the Corrado just isn't practical to carry kids since it's a 2door.  We had decided and placed a deposit on the new Chrysler PTCruiser.  What does all of this have to do with a Lamborghini Jalpa?  Glad you asked, 'cause in March of this year we decided to cancel our order for the PT.  The dealer kept extending the delivery date and the delivery price kept getting higher and higher.  We actually sold our slot to someone else for $1000 and got our deposit back; and the car has since been delivered, but it left us without a new car.  I found that I could get about $17,000 for the Corrado and along with the deposit and some savings it left me with about $30k or so that I could spend.  Well, what could I get for $30k?  Countless Hondas, Toyotas, Fords, Chevys, and even a few Mercedes and BMW's.  For some reason, a 1986 Jalpa tuned up on the search with a price of $35,000.

Now, I have to tell you that I used to be totally obsessed with the Countach--and who hasn't.  When I was 12 or so, I vowed to own one even if I had to live in it.  Then the Lambo dealer got a couple of Jalpas along with a lone LM002.  Ahhhh.  A car that costed about 1/3rd of what the Quattrovalve was going for and looked like someone put a Countach and a 308GTB in those teleport chambers from TheFly and melded the two.  What's left is a car that's, well only <i>kindof</i> exotic.  It doesn't have the big v12, no radical spoiler (although countach spoilers are fited to several jalpas) and no big airscoops. 

What it does have is style.  A sneaky kind of style.  The kind of car that your eyes kinda skim accross when you see it on the road and then something in your brain clicks a second or two later thinking &quot;what the heck was that?&quot; as you glance around for a second look.  It's got a glorious exhaust note that only a carburated italian engine can deliver.  An interior that somehow seems spartan and luxurious at the same time.  A car that seems like it's one thing and then the complete opposite at second glance.  Weird.

What's even stranger is that you can get one for under $50,000.  A Lamborghini.  Since the ad I saw was for a dealership in Florida, I looked around the web and quickly found about 12 cars for sale in Europe and the US.  One was in Southern California priced around $41,000.  I called up the guy and arrainged a test drive.

The car was prettier in real life than the pictures are, but that's true of anything, really.  It's also alot larger than you'd think.  While looking at the exterior of the car, it seems a little mild as far as exotics go, but visual clues like the fender flares barely hiding the massive gold anodized Countach &quot;telephone dial&quot; rims and the meaty rubber that is shod upon them tell you that this car isn't merely an Italian Corvette, but possibly something more.

Sitting behind the steering wheel, I was greeted to a familiar italian dash layout big dials flanked by buttons in pods to the sides.  No curvy, swoopy ford taurus-ey dash, but a big block on info parked under your nose.  The seats were surprisingly comfy, offering good support and trimmed in leather that wouldn't be out of place in a Bentley. Open sky over my head made the experience that much sweeter. Visability was very good to the front, but the huge C pillars create a pretty big blind spot on the passenger's side; not really a problem unless you are trying to merge towards an offramp in slowNgo LA traffic--the owner assured me that he never had any incidents trying to merge...  The mirrors are as good as they need to be.

The clutch is ungodly heavy.  While depressed, I was afraid that my spindly leg would buckle and the force of the pedal would send my knee into my jaw.  That never happened thankfully, but I did accidentally squeal the tires a few times from a dead stop as a just couldn't keep the clutch half depressed to slip it on take off.  Obviously there was no lack of torque to handle this abuse, although I did notice a slight off-idle hesitation.  Although it seemed overly heavy, I don't think the clutch would be that impossible or uncomfortable to get used to, but you would be seriously struggling in traffic and probably utter a foul string of obscenities at every light you got caught at.

Shifting gears in any car that's equipped with a gated shifter is very tough to get used to; especially after my Volkswagon that's been retrofitted with an ultra-short throw shifter.  Shifting goes from literally a 2 inch twich in the general direction of the next gear (it seems like that anyway, I've been driving that car for so long), to a very purposeful over-up, down-over, up-over affair.  I've never driven a gated shifter before, so it was kindof a shock.  Upside is, triple digits are had in 3rd without even coming close to the redline.  It's rated at only 255hp, which is only 30 more HP than my Volkswagon, but man it feels like another 100 easy and sounds so good that you'll wanna make a recording and sleep to it.

I've driven my dad's DeLorean alot, and we had a GT4 when I was younger, so I guess I'm kinda used to people checkin the ride so to speak, but EVERY person I looked at while on the drive was looking at the car.  Young, old, canine, whatever were seriously studying this car while it was on the road--maybe it was that double-take phenominon I talked about earlier...  I ended up not buying the car, but we sold the Saturn and bought a completely sensical Plymouth Voyager momvan instead.  I think I'm going to keep my eye out for another one of these cars though--very cool.

Fanal words:  Would I recommend this car?  YES!  If you are looking for something exotic and for something that's the diametric opposite to the dime-a-dozen Porsche911's a Jalpa might be right up your alley.  As your aware, the major expense of an exotic isn't necessarily the purchase price of the car; ask any Diablo owner how many times their car has been in the shop, and the J is no exception.  Thankfully it's a carburated V8 and not a fuel injected 12, so it might be a little cheaper to maintain--don't count on it though.  Tires run about $300 each, there *are* no replacement parts and it gets about 8Mpg.  But then again, you get alot of grins per gallon too--more so than any Porsche or Corvette that can be had for more than the price of this Lambo.  I guarantee you'd never see another besides yours on the street, except maybe at the Running of the Bulls or some other Lambo event.  It's not a Miuara or a diablo, but it's not half a mil, either.<br><br>
