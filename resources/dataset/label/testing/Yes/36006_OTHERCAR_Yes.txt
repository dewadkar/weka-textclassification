            After reading some negative reviews of the Sony DSC P20 I felt I had to come to it's defense. Although it only offers a 1 megapixel resolution, the images produced are sharp and clear. Sure, in today's era of 3 and 4 megapixel cameras it can't compare but for most of us it produces fine 4 x 6 photos. 
When I bought mine last year it was $190.00 and had enough features to make a recreational shutterbug happy. If you want 35mm quality pics this isn't your camera. Most of us take occasional pictures and aren't too concerned with producing professional results.
The camera is fairly easy to use, for a digital camera that is. The first thing you'll want to do is toss the 4 MB smart card that cheap old Sony includes and get at least a 64 MB card which will allow you to take dozens of pictures. The second thing you'll want is rechargeable batteries as, like most digital cameras, this baby eats them for lunch. 
The LCD screen on the back of the camera is smallish and impossible to use in bright light, but works good for indoor pictures. I use the LCD more than the viewfinder as it allows a better framing of objects. The camera takes very nice indoor pictures and the flash produces enough light to make all but the darkest of indoor shots very presentable.
Outdoors, as I said earlier, you have to use the view finder, but it does produce very nice pictures and the colors produced are accurate and crisp.
It's easy to toggle through pictures you've taken, but they could have made it easier to delete pictures by making it a one step process. Overall the camera's functions are fairly easy to master with a little practice. 
It's a snap to download pictures to your computer but the software is weak on editing pictures and organizing them. Too many steps are needed to organize pictures into logical groupings. 
That said, I'm cheap so I didn't go out and buy a photoshop program and still have my pictures somewhat arranged by group. I only wish the editing was more precise. Oh well. 
I'll probably end up buying a megapixel camera in a year or two, but my Sony has completely replaced my 35mm camera. Heck, I don't even know where that is now!
