            A fast car or a nice, comfy car...?

This is the question that has been lingering in carlovers' mind ever since Fred Flintstone... no wait.. Henry Ford.. started the car revolution. 

The Saab 900S falls into the nice &amp; sporty category. First of all, its 135kW (about 170horsepower) V6 engine packs quite a punch, however it is needed, since its handling isn't quite up to scratch on high speed, and it weighs around 3000 pounds, or about 1.3 tonnes. Its 0-60 (mph) is about 7.9 seconds, or so claimed, and that's no slouch. It is also packed with nice pleasant features such as ABS brakes, traction control, and very cool headlights that move up &amp; down at your will :)

More specifically, its handing isn't great in that it picks up a little understeer with oldish tires. The level of grip, on its hard stock suspension isn't that great, and you might find the need to lower the car, get top of the range tyres, get softer suspension at price of less responsive car, or simply, don't speed!

However it is the luxury features that really put it, in my book, a nice car.. First of all, the stereo - the tweeters and the rear speakers pump out a decent amount of bass and treble, enough to rival any set that doesn't have a subwoofer, and for a stock system, certainly good. 

It also has a nifty on-board computer that calculates the milage that can be obtained with the current fuel-load, and it'll prevent you from looking embarrasingly stupid and running out of fuel, as well as tell you the fuel economy - even though it's certainly nothing to write home about. 

What is a very nice touch, for me, are the heated seats - it's a cold day, you're just driving back from work, and at a touch of a button, voila, your seat is warm &amp; comfy in just couple of minutes!

However being a European car, it will break down once or twice, and if repairs are needed, prepare yourself for the parts won't come cheap at all.

All in all, in comparison to other used cars of similar price bought second hand, it won't win any contests on speed or features, but combined, it is hard to beat. Pity about the plain looks though. Oh well, at least I'm getting used to it, like it even :)<br><br>
