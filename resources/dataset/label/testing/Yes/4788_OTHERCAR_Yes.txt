            Every car I ever bought has been an Audi.  The quality, the service, the ride, the extras make the Audi pleasureable to drive and own.  On my 50th birthday my big present was my A6.  I drive 50 miles to and from work everyday and this car makes the car pleasureable.  It's smooth, quiet and reliable in all kinds of weather and traffic.The sound system and the automatic climate control make contribute to the comforts of this car.  

Audi service is convenient and customer friendly.  For the first three years the service was completely free.  This included not only the &quot;new car&quot; type of service but also state inspections, windshield wipers and a lease car.  

In January of last year I skidded on ice and hit sled into three other vehicle. (Two were 4 wheel drive vehicles.) There was damage to the car but I was not hurt.  The officer at the scene contributed to the way the audi was manufactured and built.  

I strongly recommend this car.  It's fun and safe. The only thing it can't do is go through traffic jams. Happy driving. <br><br>
