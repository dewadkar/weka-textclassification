            I have owned 4 cars in the past..  This is the best car I have ever driven in my life!  I have driven, an Infiniti QX4, Bentley Azure, and 97 Town Car, and this car goes above them all.  I have driven it 1500 miles in one day (Road Trip to Alabama) at 105 Mph (Top Factory Speed), it didn't give me a single problem.  My only complaint is the fog lights which love to burn out so quickly.  I have installed a performance chip which allows the car to max out at around 130 or so.  It is an excellent car to drag race on the street or pro.  I have installed a professional sound system which sounds perfect in the car, it's trunk provides an excellent compression chamber for 2 12&quot; subwoofers.  On a good day the car can be heard for a 1/4 mile.  It's blind spots have almost gotten me in trouble a couple times, that's where the power comes in handy!<br><br>
