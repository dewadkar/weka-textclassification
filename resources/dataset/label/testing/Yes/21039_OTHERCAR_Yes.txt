            I just recently purchased a used 1994 Chevrolet GEO Tracker. There were plenty of cars to choose from, but the GEO kept catching my eye. I liked the style of the car, the 4X4, and it just looked like an all around fun sporty car. 

I haven't had a chance to go off road with it, and can't say I ever will, but I do enjoy the way it picks up and goes! The thing I hate about the Tracker is it gets horrible gas mileage. I go through SO much gas, and with the price of gas these days, it adds up fast. 

The Tracker I purchased has a soft top, so it will be great for the summer time, we've had the top off a few times already and my son LOVES it. He thinks this car is the greatest of all time!

I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to anyone that has more than one child, as there isn't much room. Also if you have to transport a lot of stuff, there isn't much room at all. The back seat does come out, but you still don't have much room at all. <br><br>
