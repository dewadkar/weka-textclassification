            I admit it -- I don't have a car and I hate SUVs.  However, I have to agree with BobS assessment of this vehicle -- it's really a solid, dependable and smooth ride.  

If I was in the market for a big car (and believe me, I more often need carrying capacity than transportation in San Francisco!) I would lean toward the Ford Explorer.  For a SUV, it's comfy, easy to park and gives you great visibility when you're stuck in rush hour traffic on 101 or 80.

Friends and relatives who have owned them rave about them -- and as BobS so eloquently put it --  you could sleep in the seats!<br><br>
