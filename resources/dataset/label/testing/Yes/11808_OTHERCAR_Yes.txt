            I have needed a truck so often that when it came time to pass my car down to my youngest son I decided that the timing was right.  I found a 1998 Nissan Frontier 2WD with 23,000 miles.  The truck is well built, well finished and very sturdy.  The 2WD version shares the same frame as the 4WD. The truck has a bench seat that can accommodate 3 adults as long as the middle person is related to the driver (at a minimum fond of). The powertrain warranty from Nissan is 5yrs or 60,000 miles from the original purchase date.  This makes the Frontier a very attractive selection for the used truck buyer.  The ride of the Frontier is firm and feels very solid.  There is not a squeek or rattle anywhere on the truck.  Handling is as expected for a truck, not bad but it's not a car. Transmission linkage is very precise and torque range of the motor is forgiving for those not paying attention to what gear they are in.  Gas mileage on two long trips has been 28 mpg. When I first bought the truck it had a ugly graphic stripe down both sides.  After using a hair dryer to warm the graphic, it pealed right off.  I would would highly recommend this truck because of it's overall quality and price. <br><br>
