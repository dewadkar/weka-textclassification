            I think that this is a good camera for someone new to the digital era. It is easy to use, and the functions are easy to understand. It has several distance settings, and multiple flash settings. Red-eye reduction is also a good feature. The viewing screen is a nice touch too. But when it comes to battery life, you are looking at less than a half an hour, whether it is used much or not. A person would have to invest in rechargables to save money. This camera does not have any zooming features. I bought mine with the kit, which came with software and accessories. The price was right, and so far the camera has done ok for me.
