            What's a man to do when he has to give up his Acura Integra and search for a car that can comfortably carry a family of four, including two children in car seats?  Does he give up his youth forever and make that long, desolate trip to the Toyota Camry dealer, or the Honda Accord salesman and just call it a life, never to see a &quot;fun&quot; car again for 18 years?  Is it really over this quickly?

No.  I made the trip to the Toyota dealer and just couldn't do it.  Now, don't get me wrong, the Camry is a fine car, and so is the Honda Accord.  But so is the Saturn and a thousand other cars.  They are also boring to look at and boring to drive.  Thus, the quest began.  I needed a car that was both fun to drive and family compatible, yet in a price range that didn't send me back to bartending school in hopes of finding a second job.  

Gradually, I found I wanted German engineering.  I wanted a car that could hug the country roads that take me home (pun intended, on the John Denver song).  I wanted the Volkswagen Jetta.  Specifically, the Volkswagen Jetta GLX with the V6 engine.  Get in one today and pretend your life is still your own!

Now Volkswagen is probably most renowned for the New Beetle, but the Jetta is actually one of the most popular cars on the roads today.  After you take a test drive, you quickly find out why.  The GLX has just about everything you can get on a Volkswagen.  Here's a partial list: Heated leather seats, climate control, monsoon sound system, genuine wood interior trim, power sunroof and door locks, power seats, heated mirrors and window washers, rear sunshade, remote keyless entry, one-touch windows (both up and down), 16&quot; alloy wheels, cruise, full-sized spare tire, traction control, driver and passenger front and side airbags, ABS brakes, child safety locks, etc.....But the drive is what really gets you.  There really IS a difference between German cars and other vehicles on the road.  I always thought it was just good promotion to justify outrageous prices.  You can't really explain it except to say there is a solid feeling in the Volkswagen that is lacking in the Camry or the Accord.  It's like other cars are driving ON the road, while the Volkswagen is a PART of the road.  I know, I know, I'm starting to sound like some geek from Car &amp; Driver magazine, but it's true.

The Jetta GLX is a dangerous machine.  You think you are travelling at a relatively normal speed only to look down and see you're doing 70 mph on a country road that was probably meant for something slower.  But the handling on the Jetta is so tight and effortless (if you hear the tires squealing, then you're REALLY out of control and need to slow down), that it just feels good to take turns without having to put on the brakes.  Another deceptive thing about the Jetta that tricks you on how fast you are going is that it is so quiet.  Both wind noise and engine noise are much more reduced than in other vehicles I've test driven (including the Camry and Accord).

I had a hard time trying to decide between the V6 and the Turbo four cylinder.  The Turbo is obviously cheaper and gets slightly better gas mileage (although the TDI gets up to 48 miles per gallon on diesel fuel) than the V6, it's also not as powerful or quiet.  In the end, I opted on the V6 with the manual transmission.  The V6 just has more pep (174 hp with 170 lb/ft. of torque.) It's the first time I've ever owned a manual, but it just seemed the right thing to do for this type of car.  I would never, for example, opt to get a manual transmission on a Camry or Accord.    You save about $1,000 by getting the manual, but you really don't lose a lot of performance by getting the automatic, it's just a matter of preference and where you live and what kind of traffic you're in day-to-day.

The seats on the Jetta are very comfortable, but there is one complaint here.  The lumbar support is manually operated.  A minor nuisance, but hopefully something they work on in the future.  The winter package (standard on the GLX) includes heated seats, which is wonderful when starting out on a cold morning.  There is also plenty of head room, and the seats can move up or down depending on your height.  The backs seats are tighter than those in the Camry and Accord, but I still fit two children in car seats in the back without any difficulty.  The dash is very attractive, with a nice mix of red and blue lighting for night driving.  The trunk is larger than expected, and the rear seats tilt down for added storage capacity.  The outside of the Jetta is very German looking, and the 16&quot; alloy tires complete the look.  I still haven't quite figured out all of the controls, i.e. cruise and climate control, but they are all easily laid out and accessible.

Have I missed anything?  Oh yeah, the price.  The Jetta GLX has a stated invoice of $22,985 including freight and destination charge.  That's exactly what I paid for it.  Paying invoice on a Volkswagen is actually a very good deal, because VW has few if any incentives comparable to other automobile lines.  In other words, they don't give dealerships rebates simply because they sell a lot of cars.  Other dealers quoted a bottom-line price of about $800 over invoice.  Email me and I will give you the name of the dealership (Baltimore Area).  

Anything else?  Well, yes.  The Jetta has performed exceptionally well in crash tests, and the dealer informed me that it was ranked second in its class in safety tests.  (I haven't checked this out yet, but I will).  Suffice it to say that while the Jetta may not quite be a Volvo in terms of safety consciousness, it ranks right up there.

Wow, this sounds too good to be true.  Isn't there anything negative to say about the Jetta?  Well, of course, no car is perfect.  The warranty is the biggest negative on the Jetta, with a 2-year or 24K mile bumper-to-bumper that doesn't compare favorably to other cars in its class.  Mitigating this somewhat is that the warranty covers all scheduled maintenance during this time, so you won't have to pay for oil changes for awhile.  Also, the power train warranty is 12 years or 100k miles, and the rust warranty is 144 months with unlimited miles.  Maybe I'm looking for too much, but I also think fuel economy should be better (19 city; 28 highway), but the miles per gallon is highlighted on the dash as you're driving in an effort to keep your foot off the pedal.  I also expect the manual to do better than what's listed, maybe 32 on average.  

In summary, the Jetta is a great car and a lot of bang for the buck.  If you're like me, and you want a family capable care without sacrificing yourself to the old man vehicles that abound on the road (I have to admit, I also own a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo for the serious family driving), then the Jetta is an excellent choice.
