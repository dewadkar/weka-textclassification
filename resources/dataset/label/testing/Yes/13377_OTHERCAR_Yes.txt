            I bought my 1993 Chevy Cavalier a year and a half ago.  I needed a reliable, inexpensive car to get me to college and back.  Mine is aqua green with dark gray interior, and a 2.2 4 cyl engine.  I believe most of these cars come standard with power door locks, and ABS mine also has a/c, cd player (which I added), and it is an automatic.  

So far I have put 22,000 miles on it, so it now has 100,700 miles on it.  It leaks no oil, or any other fluids.  I must admit, luckily it had a warranty because it blew a head gasket(which they are notorious for), the starter and ignition module went bad.  It gets 30 miles to the gallon.  I fell in love with the car at first sight.  It runs great and handles wonderfully on bad roads.  I tried to get my car stuck, and tried to make it slip, but it wouldn't.  

The only few things I don't like is mine only came with one side mirror, so I bought a junk yard mirror, the factory radio does not have good signal, and it can be a dog going up a hill with your a/c running.  I also bought a spoiler and front end mask for it because of the huge black bumpers.  It looks awesome now!!!   

This car is fun and easy to drive.  It handles great around turns, and for the price and size of the car it rides wonderfully.  I would recommend this car for any high school or college student.  They are inexpensive to buy and to run.  The back seat has sufficient room, so even a small family could fit comforably.  This is one great Chevy!!!<br><br>
