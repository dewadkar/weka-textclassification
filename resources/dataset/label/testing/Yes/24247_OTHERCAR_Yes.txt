                The 1998 Chevy Tahoe was one of the first trucks that I had bought. When I test drove it the thing I noticed immediately was the power of the engine. The Tahoe has the same exact engine as the Suburban, but it is lighter of course, which offers much more power. I routinely drive long distances on the interstates, and my Tahoe has always proved itself to be more than capable. Although gas mileage is an issue of concern with many potential buyers, the saftey and performance of the Tahoe vastly outweighed my reservations about the costs. My Tahoe performs very well off road too, with four wheel drive I can take it out anywhere in the country without the fear of not making it back to civilization. The truck corners much better than other cars in its class. Also, the wide wheel base offers incredible stability. I like the high position of the driver's seat too, it is much easier to see out in front of the car. I am extremely pleased with this car, it has held up admirably over the 70,000 miles, which I have driven it. For my money there's not a better SUV on the market.<br><br>
