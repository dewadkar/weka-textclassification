            I recieved this camera for christmas.  I had been wanting a digital camera for a while but didn't knwo which one to go with.  Most of the ones I was looking for were over $500.  My parents bought me this one and it had all of the features I wanted.  It's great, it has a good size LCD screen and is very clear.  It has a great selection of features and options to help customize your pictures.  One thing that I do not like about this camera is that they don't package the power adapter with the camera.  They tell you that it is an optional accessory.  This is not true.  When you use the required four AA batteries you can shoot about 200 pictures.  The only problem is downloading them to your computer.  The USB conncetion draws A LOT of power.  You only get about 10 - 30 pictures before the batteries die out.  I think that this is pitiful.  You can buy rechargable batteries, not included, and recharge them everyother time you want to transfer pictures, but that is a pain in the butt.  Overall, It's a decent camera with great picture quality.
