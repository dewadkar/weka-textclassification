            We just bought our van in December of 1999. We have the E-150 Conversion.  And i just have to say that I love this van.  I have 4 kids, so anything smaller just would not work.  We have had a few problems with minor things.  Like a blind screw coming out and a ground wire being loose.  I just took it back to the dealership and they fixed it right there, both times. And of course no cost to me.

We got the one with the t.v. and separate radio in the back with 4 headphones (thank god). So when we go anywhere the kids put on there headphones and they can either listen to THEIR radio or watch a movie and not bother us at all.  The car rides are so peaceful.  No fighting, no 100 times are we there yet.  It is great.  

It drives so smooth. I like the way that with ford vans you sit up higher the you do in other vans.  Trips this year are going to be a vacation and not a headache.  I can't wait till summer.  And the seat are comfy and adjust perfect so that I'm comfortable when I drive.<br><br>
