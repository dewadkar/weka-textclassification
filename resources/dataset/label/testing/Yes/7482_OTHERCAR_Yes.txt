            I know jaduli personally he and I met while on a track team years ago.  I have ridden in the Toyota Truck in question. The Truck is a solid piece of machinery and I do not blame him for not wanting to sell it.  My father-in-law owns a Toytoa pick up just like jaduli's and he drove the wheels off of it this summer.  250,000 miles.  Then he took it in, and they fixed the Clutch, and rings and the truck is like brand new. Kirby said that I could have it in 15 years when he dies.  It will still be running after 400,000 miles.. I bet..<br><br>
