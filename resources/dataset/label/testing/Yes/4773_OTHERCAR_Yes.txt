            I've been the proud owner of a 1998 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro for almost one year. It has amazing handling characteristics and is a real pleasure to drive.I have just a couple of miniscule complaints and comments about the car; the back seat lacks adequate legroom for any person over four feet tall, the radio reception is poor in outlining areas(possibly the rear window antenna is the source of the problem). Otherwise, the optional Bose sound system coupled with six CD changer is superb and the optional leather interior offers one of the best grade leather I've seen. My vehicle does not have the optional sport suspension and ,quite frankly, I wouldn't want the suspension to be any firmer.The overall fit and finish is outstanding and the free maintenance feature makes servicing a breeze.In summary, a great car! <br><br>
