            We recently bought a 2001 Mazda MPV.  There are many things about this van that put it above the rest.  The first thing is the price.  We bought the high end one.  The MSRP was $27,500, yet we got the dealer down to $24,900!  This is atleast $4,000 less than any other vehicles that come close to comparing with it.  Another great thing is the many features it has.  There are so many features the only way you can figure out all of them is to look at the owners manual, it would take a year for the dealer to tell all of them to you.  One of the greatest features is the seating arrangements.  If you want some space in the back and you are tired of having to lug around those heavy rear seats when you take them out then this is perfect.  If you have seen the Honda Odyssey it is similar to that.  The back seat folds down into the floor!  It is completely effortless to do.  The back seats aren't the only well designed ones either.  You can slide the middle row seat all the way bacl, then fold the front seat all the way back and it is like a recliner.  The middle row seats also slide left and right, so you can have either bench or bucket seats.  Another thing that kids like is in the back instead of having the windows that pop out about an 1/8 of an inch it has windows that actually roll about half way down.  In the deluxe model they are power, in the standard model they are roll-down.  One more great window feature is on the model we got it has a sunroof.  So you can fold your seats into the recliners, sit back, and watch the stars.  It also has many other features such as wood trim, great headlights, and a 6-CD In Dash Stacker with 9 Speakers!  The one thing about this car that I don't like a tremendous amount is the engine.  It is great for backroads and areas like that.  Although when you get on the highway you start to feel the difference between this and the Odyssey and Windstar.  This is a great car for people with kids especially.<br><br>
