            Been given the priviledge to drive a Maranello for 1.5 days. To put things in perspective, I own a 355GTS F1, this will be my main point of comparison.

Have always been in love with the looks of the 550. Some people don't like front engined Ferraris, I am on the opposite side. The purity and grace of the lines has no equivalent in my opinion.

The first kms were not piece of cake. Aside from the fact it's a rather expensive piece of machinery to drive in trafic, the very low inertia of the engine, the rather firm gearbox (I am used to paddle shifting and to an Audi 6-speed manual which is a different world) get a while to get used to.
Suprisingly, however, it did not take too long to feel 'at home' in this jewel.

On winding roads, handling is no match with the 355. Weight and damping pay their toll here, and selecting the sports mode is a must when driving fast while it's almost useless in the 355. Grip remains lower, and the inertia to weight transfer very perceivable.
The car remains highly capable, but does not feel like a go-kart (should it ?).

Traction control is a lifesaver (a wallet-saver I should say) as the torquey V12 would have no trouble putting you sideways at every corner exit. Never dared to switch it off, not with a car that price which wasn't mine. Corners which can be exited flat out in the 355 end up with a rather brutal (and probably necessary) drop in power as traction control sets the limits between enthusiasm and a disaster.
Still, it allows quite a bit of slippage on straight accelerations, making the 550 pretty wild in 1st, 2nd and third.

Brakes are good, probably not Porsche class but feel is nicer than the wooden 355 pedal.

High speed handling is superb, a must with such a massive amount of power which takes you in no time to very unpolitically correct speeds.

Assembly quality is a clear improvement over the 355, interior details are not as much of a shame, but unfortunately still behind German standards (Audi and Porsche).
Cost of ownership looks nearly insane if, or rather when, hammering, never put so much money in gas in such a short time, and torque & weight must send the brakes and tires budget to impressive amounts.

Overall, the car remains a dream and next on my list after the 355. Probably not the fastest point to point machine, try a 996-biturbo instead, but riding and looking at this thing are unforgettable experiences.

Update, 12/29/03:
I now have the priviledge to own a 2001 Titanium 550, a sign that I stuck with my recommendation ! Three years in my ownership of a 355 F1, I truly welcome the contrast and the truly different experience the 550 delivers: intimidating torque, a gearbox stick that gives an uncomparable sense of connection with the car. My first weeks of ownership were however marked by a couple of yet-to-be-diagnosed quality issues, such as a driver window seal which does not fit perfectly in the window and leaks a bit, and bizarre "klonks" in the front train when steering to the max at low speeds. I also wish the car had a tad more audible presence, aftermarket Tubi exhausts resonate way too much, but the OEM system is a bit too shy.
