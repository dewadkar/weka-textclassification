            The muscle car lives. 

The 98+ Trans Am, with a 305HP 5.7L LS1 engine
(and it's f-body cousin the Camaro Z28) is the
only &gt;300HP choice less than $30k. And if you
do your part, it will deliver 13 second quarter
mile

Stomp on the gas and the ample low end torque
pushes you back into the seat. Above 3k rpm, the
tach rushes towards redline with reckless
abandon -- even in 3rd gear. 

While not as refined as the Vette, todays 
Trans Am might surprise you -- the seats are
extremely comfortable (-especially with power
lumbar support), and the ride, while stiff, is
cushy enough that you can take your mom for
a spin. 

The back seats are sizable enough
for full size adults for short trips, and
when folded down delivers station wagon like
cargo space. 

Other cool options are removable T tops (great
for California), 500 watt monsoon sound system
(really excellent for a factory system), and 
the same 6 speed tranny featured in the (much)
more expensive Vette. 

The brakes on the Trans Am are really superlative,
stopping with breathtaking speed. 

Sure,  the insurance costs an arm and a leg, but
but it is fun knowing you can smoke almost any
car on the road, or take it up to 65 in 2nd gear.<br>
