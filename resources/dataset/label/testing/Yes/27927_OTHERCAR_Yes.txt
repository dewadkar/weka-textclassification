                I am the second owner of this 1998 GS 300 and have had the car for almost 2 months now.  This is my second Lexus. The first was a '92 ES 300, which I traded in. I bought this model, because I wanted to upgrade to a bigger car, and wanted to own another Lexus.  My experience with Lexus has been mostly good.  The car has a good amount of pick up.  I can leave cars sitting at the green light, if I want to.  The sound system is very good, although I would like more mid-range.  The quality of the interior parts is high. No cheap plastic here, just fine wood, leather and other high-end components.  I really like the way the car looks.  In Florida, you can have dark-tinted windows, and this helps the car look sleek. 
     Making sharp turns produces a little too much body roll, and gas mileage has not been fantastic.  But this is a heavier car than I used to drive, so those things are to be expected.  Overall, I am happy with my GS 300, and am glad to be an owner of such a hot-looking machine.
      Lexus service is good, not great. I have had trouble with "voice mail" but I am hoping that will be fixed.
