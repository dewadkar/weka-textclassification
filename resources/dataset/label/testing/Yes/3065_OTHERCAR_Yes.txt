                 A good buddy of mine owns a 97 Dodge Intrepid and loves it greatly.  After riding around and driving it a little I'm very partial to this excellent mid-sized sedan as well.  I'm a die-hard Hyundai fan, but Dodge is a close second in my book.
     First and foremost, I don't understand why this car is classified as a &quot;mid-sized&quot; sedan.  Large-size is more appropriate, and the vehicle demonstrates Dodge's tendency to produce vehicles somewhat larger then the rest in its class.  Like the Stratus the Intrepid boasts excellent leg room in both the front and the back, and very comfortable seats.  And surprise!  The arm rest is actually a real arm rest, not an afterthought.  The console is well designed but lacks a lot of storage area.  Dave (my friend) used to ferry five people around all the time with no problems whatsoever.
     The handling is smooth and responsive, and while not the best in the class (look to Pontiac or Hyundai for that), the engine is definitely ample in the power department.  This is a welcome addition to the Intrepid's finer points.  People who read my review on the Chrysler Sebring Convertible will recall my comment that the Sebring was bested by the beast under the Intrepid's hood.  Given the Intrepid's power I tend to think of it more as a four-door sports coupe then a sedan.  The down side to this is that the Intrepid's gas mileage isn't as good as most comparable cars.
     The struts absorb an incredible amount of shock, providing for a very smooth ride- almost as smooth as the Hyundai Tiburon sports coupe.
     All in all the Intrepid is a solid choice for the family or the fun-loving.  Think of the Intrepid as an improved Stratus- and use that as your basis for comparison.  This is a fine sedan, and while not my personal favorite is nonetheless an excellent vehicle.<br><br>
