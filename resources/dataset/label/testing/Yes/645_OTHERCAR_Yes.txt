            As a professional graphic artist and photographer, I've been using the 950 in my work for nearly 2 years now. My first digital camera, an Olympus D-600L was probably the best at the time but couldn't handle the more demanding aspects of my work - product photography for brochures, etc. The resolution just wasn't there. I began searching some well known and respected online digital camera sites and soon discovered the CP950 was the one that warranted a closer look. I downloaded a lot of 950 pics from several sources so I could get them into Photoshop and do some serious scrutinizing. What I saw was an exciting elevation in quality from my D-600L. At that time the 950 was just making its debut and was pricey and difficult to get. As a result of previous bad experiences, I don't order anything online, so I had to wait for the local stores to get the 950 in stock. I knew I would be purchasing the 950 so in preparation, I put the word out to friends and colleagues that my D-600L might be for sale soon and within a couple weeks had a good friend commit to buying it along with all the memory cards and an Epson Stylus Color 800 printer I wasn't using, having been replaced by a Stylus Color 900 (phenomenal printer).

I found that Wolf Camera would be the only store in my area to carry the 950 so asked the manager to call me as soon as they received any. I received a call from him the next week informing me that he got two 950s in. I went in the same day to take a look at the camera and liked what I saw. Much smaller and more convenient to use than the D-600L. But they were selling it at full retail...$1,000! Fortunately, Wolf camera will price match any store in the country as long as there's a Wolf Camera in the same city. So I got on Wolf Camera's web site and printed out a list of their locations. There's one in NYC (oh thank you, Lord!), which opened up a real can of worms! I bought a Popular Photography magazine and found a store in NYC selling the 950 for $875 and had it in stock. Oh happy day! I took my printouts and magazine to Wolf to prove the price and they not only matched it but I talked them into including two 15MB CompactFlash cards. Not bad. Wolf is a great place to deal with.

Anyway, it took a while to get used to the camera but within a week most of the features were becoming second nature and I was getting spectacular results. I've used the 950 for product photography, promotional materials, brochures and even astrophotography with the 950 attached to a Celestron C-8 telescope. Oh yes, I sold the D-600L and printer to my friend, which helped pay for the 950.

After nearly 2 years and over 8,000 pictures, I've discovered several design flaws, most of which I work around...such as a flimsy memory card door that has a problem staying closed, the front rubber hand grip falling off, memory card door and battery compartment door on bottom of camera, requiring removal of the camera from a tripod to access, CCD noise in dark areas of pictures - sometimes resembling an oil slick, strong blue fringing on edges of bright areas, blues and reds not reproduced accurately, etc. But the positives far outweigh the negs. The versatility of the swivel design has allowed me to get shots that would have been impossible with a standard fixed design. I wouldn't have another camera without this feature, unless it's a second camera. Photo quality is superb and I can correct the blue/red reproduction (which is just slightly off) in Photoshop. I recently used the 950 for the picture of a beautiful woman positioned in front of her paintings for the cover of a full color magazine and the final reproduction is extraordinary, rivaling a 35mm cover.

Take this camera (and any digital camera) for what it is...a product developed within a segment of the industry still in its infancy. All digital cameras have problems and shortcomings. Also, keep in mind its NOT a 35mm SLR and shouldn't be compared. Digital camera design is advancing in leaps and bounds and the 950 is an important stepping stone in the process.

<B>NOTE:</B> I've dedicated a comprehensive web site to the CP950, including instructions with photos for my homemade accessories such as a cable release bracket, an eyeshade for the LCD screen, slide/negative copier, and a bracket to mount the 950 to a Celestron C-8 telescope. You'll also find some helpful tips, FAQ, complete list of likes & dislikes, and LOTS of photos, including astrophotography. The URL is:
