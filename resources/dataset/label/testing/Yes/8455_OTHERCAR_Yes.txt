            The latest addition to Olympuses digital camera lineup is the C-3030.  The C-3030 is a 3.3-megapixel camera which will produce very nice looking 8x10's.  Although the C-3030 Zoom's black body looks like its predecessor's, the grip side of it is made of a lighter plastic that's lightly larger and textured. At under 11 ounces without batteries, the camera falls into the compact category. The C-3030's perfect placement of function buttons, including the multi-directional navigation buttons seen on most digicams, belies the complexity of the camera's all-encompassing functionality. The zoom lever, operated with the index finger rather than the thumb, does take a little getting used to and the untethered lens cap, a stupid design flaw, makes it easy to lose. But overall, the camera's body is designed very well. The Olympus 3x optical zoom aspherical glass lens and CCD have always been among the industry's best. The 1/2-inch CCD chip is larger in this model therefore offers a slightly larger field of view.  This hardware is capable of capturing images at resolutions of 2048 by 1536, 1600 by 1200, 1280 by 960, 1024 by 768, and 640 by 480 in both JPEG and uncompressed TIFF formats. This flexibility may be confusing (there's also a Normal and Quality setting for each JPEG) but we like these options because they give many more options to the photographer. Plus, Olympus includes a 16MB SmartMedia card, absolutely the minimum size for a camera in this class. You can take about six shots at the highest quality level (SHQ), 123 Web-ready shots (640 by 480), or one 2048 by 1536 uncompressed TIF shot on this card.

I have been selling Olympus digital cameras for years and really support there products.  I would recommend this camera to just about anyone in the market for a high end consumer camera.<br><br>
