            In September 1999, when my wife and I were in the market to purchase a new vehicle, it didn't take us to long to realize the great value ensemble the new Golf offered. Depending mainly on your needs, the Golf can be a terrific choice ether as a first or second car. 

You should seriously consider this car if:
1)You like a tight suspension combined with precise steering;
2)You want the most equipment and features possible;
3)You need a small hatchback for practical purposes, like driving and parking in city traffic;
4)You want comfortable seats and a good driving position;
5)You want a quiet and well designed cockpit;
6)You appreciate German engineering, styling and luxury;
7)You want excellent gas mileage(1.9L Diesel engine);
8)You want to keep your car for many years to come.

You should consider other vehicles if:
1)You want a spacious interior;
2)You want minimum equipment and price since less expensive cars can get you from point A to point B anyway;
3)You don't like the colors offer by VW for the Golf (orange-like red, mustard yellow, and dirty green);
4)You have three children, your spouse is begging you to have more, and you only have cash for one vehicle;
5)Reliability is first in your criteria list.

I must mention to you the poor reliability of the standard 2.0L engine. I had to bring in the Golf for repairs 3 times because of this tweaky engine. First time they adjusted the "mass air flow", second time they replaced it, and then some of the car's electrical system was changed. If I were to buy the car again, I would definitly go for the 1.9L Diesel engine or the 1.8L Turbo.

PS: Please don't forget to rate my opinion!
