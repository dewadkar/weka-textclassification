            I just purchased a 2004 Saturn ION 2.  I did much research and found that this is the car that best meets my needs and criteria:  reliability, warranty, durability, safety, and it has to get good gas mileage.  I talked with many other Saturn owners, and all of them assured me that they have or would buy another Saturn.  They all talked to me about how much they love their car, and some have had it for more than 5 years.  This told me that reliability would not be an issue.  If they could rely on their vehicle to still operate properly and to continue to meet their needs after many years, then I was satisfied.  The standard warranty  that Saturn offers is a 3 year/36,000 mile warranty.  I opted to upgrade to a 5 year/75,000 mile warranty.  In addition to the warranty, Saturn offers roadside assistance at no additional charge.  During the demonstration, the salesman literally beats on the side of the car to demonstrate that it is made to take small impacts without denting the panels of the car.  I noticed other salesman doing the same.  The salesman told me that the paint is supposed to resist wear as well and to not ever lose its shiny gleam.  I can testify to the fact that someone has already rammed their car door into one of mine and the only evidence was a little bit of their blue paint that I easily rubbed off.  I have no dent at all and my paint was not scratched.  One other thing that I noticed was that the car battery is located in the trunk.  One of the reasons for this is to take the battery away from the heat source in the engine so that it has a longer life of at least 2 years.  As far as safety, the salesman told me that Saturn cars have an internal and external skeleton.  Basically, you are not just depending on the outer panels of the car to protect you.  There are beams on the inside as well as inner panels that protect you as well.  He said that the car could still pass all the crash tests without the outer panels on it, whereas other manufacturer's cars could not.  The ION has dual airbags,and the airbags have a feature where they inflate according to where your seat is positioned for maximum safety.  In addition, back to the battery, I can jump start the car from either the front of the back.  I can also offer a jump to someone on the side of the interstate without having to turn my car around to face opposing traffic.  Of all the Saturn owners that I have talked to, every one of them assured me that they get good gas mileage in their Saturn.  I believe that the ION gets 24 miles per gallon city, as opposed to the 15 miles per gallon I was getting in the SUV that I traded in.  One other thing that I like about the ION is its roominess.  My entire family of 4 can fit comfortably and I still have the convenience of a compact car.  The trunk is very roomy and I can easily fit a double stroller in it with a lot of room to spare.  The seats fold down easily and can be done from the trunk instead of having to climb into the car and mess with a bunch of levers.  The instrument panel is located in the center of the dash, elevated just a little so that it is in your field of view instead of having to look down and through your steering wheel to see it.  This feature took me about 30 minutes to get used to and I have to admit that I really like it.  I don't have to take my eyes off the road to see how fast I am going.  The car drives smoothly and great.  It takes corners well and I fell like I have complete control over the vehicle.  The entire car buying experience was a breeze with Saturn's no-haggle prices.  Overall, I was able to get the car I was looking for with almost all the options for a reasonable and affordable price.  I love my new Saturn!!!
