            This is probably one of the best luxury sedans available on the market. I own a 199 323i myself with the sport package. First of all, the room is decent for a small family of three or four already. I stand about 6'1" and I have to say that I'm not totally uncomfortable in the back. But there is some low headroom in the back. The front seats are great, especially with the power seats. The dash is wonderfully designed with everything in plain view. The instrument panel is all in red lighting which is a bit easier on the eyes at night than the usual green. The onboard computer is fun to play with as well with average speed, fuel consumption, etc. All the controls are clearly marked and all within easy reach. 

Fuel consumption is great and it's been running perfectly since buying it about 6 months ago. Not one problem yet.

The climate control is great as well, as you set the thermostat and it automatically adjusts the system to compensate. The sound system is heavenly as well. Crisp and clear, it's only augmented by the fact that the BMW is quiet as a mouse, despite it's powerful inline 6 cylinder.

Driving the BMW is where it all lies though. If you absolutely love driving, you must get the stick shift. The stick has a soft yet articulate feel, and the distance between gears is short for quick shifting. The handling is amazing. The car is incredibly responsive and the wheel rests firm in the hand. I truly regret buying the 323i, even though it is quite powerful, but I can only imagine what the extra fuel injection of the 328i has. It handles turns without question and it's fun to find some open roads and just totally open up the engine, redlining it before shifting. There's a perfect balance in the steering wheel as well. By this, I mean that you can feel the road and wheels in your hands, but at the same time, you won't feel that the wheel is too harsh or stiff. There's an equilibrium between easy softness and hard road transferral (essential to the driving experience) in the wheel. Braking is awesome as well. The huge brakes of the BMW let you stop on a dime with confidence.

One of the first things you have to get used to though is the front windshield. The front windshield seems to be a bit small but in application it never really presents itself to be a problem. I think that the dash is just a bit higher than most cars. But it just takes getting used to. However, the reduced or seemingly reduced visibility doesn't seem to impair driving in any way. 

If considering a mid-sized luxury sedan, test drive the BMW 3 series! It's a great car, designed with thought and care. It looks great and drives even better. BMW makes no overstatement with their motto: "The Ultimate Driving Machine". The only car I'd like to have more is the BMW M3.

Update:
It's been over a year and a half now and the car still is running great. I've had the opportunity to really gun the engine over some nice winding roads and the response is excellent. The engine never sounds strained at all even when pushing close to 6000 on the tach.

Reliability has been wonderful. This car has been through thousands of miles of long highway driving with no trouble whatsoever. No problems with engine or gearbox. Shifts are still as smooth and crisp as they were on day one. Handling is still first rate though the wheels need to be realigned a bit.

The greatest thing is that I always feel safe in this car whereever I am. The handling and power have proved to be useful in tight situations on highways.

Now that the car is old, if you're considering a 1999, it's a great car to have, and if you can find one w/ low mileage, it's a steal.
