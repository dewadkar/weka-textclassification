            	I just purchased a 2002 Ford Explorer Sport and must admit that despite some significant improvements, I am disappointed.  I leased a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport for three years.  I leased it because I was concerned that moving from a small sports car, I would not adapt well to the bigger SUV.  My concern was misplaced - I fell in love with my SUV.  Had it not been for the lease, I'd have kept that 1999 Sport.  But it made more sense financially to buy a new one.  So this review accentuates the difference between the previous Ford Explorers and the new one.

The Good
	My new Explorer is good, the suspension has been re-designed and the ride is improved, getting rid of the "hobby-horse" ride that afflicted the old Explorer Sport.  Steering is much improved as well, and this Explorer Sport feels less top-heavy and better grounded than previous ones.  BTW, the tires are Goodyear ATs.  Road noise is minimized. The new design is less "trucky" than the previous design - although I like that big honking truck look!  The Audiophile sound system, and especially the DSP  is fantastic, although I wish they could have accommodated cassette tapes  (am I dating myself?)  The SUV still has that solid, substantial feel of previous Explorer Sports (an attribute that is sadly lacking in the Ford Escape, which I also considered).  Overall, the fit and finish are good, with good quality materials used appropriately. The interior is more streamlined (not unlike the Jeep Liberty, but not as "edgy" ); the simulated brushed metal center panel and door pulls are a nice touch. There are still plenty of pockets, nooks and crannies for personal items.  

The Bad
	But there are a few things that have dampened my enthusiasm.  Head room is noticeably less, although my new sunroof exacerbates this. I'm only 5'3" and I usually don't even notice head room issues.  In the new Explorer, I do.  I miss having lighted vanity mirrors and I wish the car had been available in black instead of the red I settled on, but those are really minor points.  

The Ugly
	What I really miss is the autolamp feature, which I had thought was part of the premium package.  I did not realize how much I would miss this feature but, to my surprise, I have realized that it is not just a convenience feature, it is a safety feature.  Having the headlights stay on while I walked to my door and found my house key and let myself into the house was very reassuring.  It also prevents my leaving the lights on and returning to a dead battery - another safety issue for me.  Autolamps are generally included in cars at this price point (and are included in the other Explorer models) and I feel a little cheated not having this valuable option that I did have on my old Explorer. 

	The other really annoying feature is the seats.  The fact that the seats don't revert to their previous position when pushed forward to allow someone in or out is really a pain.  More than a pain, they are a safety hazard.  Because of the airbags, my niece rides in the back seat.  When she gets out on the passenger side, the seat stays in a position that blocks my view out the passenger window.  I have to reach over and under the front seat to push it back and then reach over to the seat lever to get the seat back into a safe position.  My old Mazda had a better system than this and Ford really ought to work on this.  To move the seat back into position requires two hands, a real pain. 

	While acceleration is good, the steering is still too clumsy and the Explorer leans ominously on turns.  And the rear wheels have a tendency to pull out to the left or right when you hit a pothole or bump, even at speeds as low as 30 mph.  This combination makes for a very uncertain feel in maneuvering.

	The Ford Explorer Sport does not have, even as options, many of the more luxurious features found in the other Explorer trim lines.  Although leather seating is available, heated seats (or as my niece calls them, "butt warmers") are not.  Neither is automatic temperature control.  I would like to have both of these items available to me as a Ford Explorer Sport owner, especially since the other Explorer models offer them. 

	But I don't want to end this review on a completely negative note.  I really enjoy my Ford Explorer Sport.  It's just that when one moves into a new car (at a higher price), you don't expect to lose any valuable features that you had in the old car; you are looking for more and in particular, better handling.  Ford diminished the quality of the Explorer Sport in this re-design. Looking back on my decision, I'd probably have looked harder at the Jeep Liberty and the Land Rover Freelander.  Although more expensive than the Ford Explorer Sport, I think they are better values.
