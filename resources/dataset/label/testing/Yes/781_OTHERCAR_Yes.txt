              The Jaguar xj sedan was filled with the things Jaguar is known for.  Quality, luxery, and high preformace.  The thing that I like best about Jaguar is that they are made to be one owner cars.  They are maid to be tweaked and tuned to be customized to their owners driving habits.  This car has a smooth ride, and two different ride along with a optional sporty driving option.  The features on this car include cd disc changer witch produces a premium sound quality.  
   Some bad things about this car are this it is rear wheel drive so if you live up north you should have a secondary means of transportation.  Also it does use a good amount of gas getting from 17-21 mpg.  It cant make a tight turn very well at high speeds due to its weight.  This car also should not really be driven in bad weather.  Its rear wheel drive gives it a disadvantage, due to the fact that there is no weight over the wheels.  
   Some things to remember are that it is a &quot;Luxery Car&quot;  Its not for everyone.  So if you have semi-deep pockets and are looking for luxery this is the way to go.  It is a wonderful car and is a head turner for sure.  So if your looking for a great car, with alot of wonderful features at the peak of quality for the Jaguar xj jaguar.
