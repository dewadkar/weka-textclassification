            Who does not want a sports car that when you fly by someone they look at your car and say I got to get me one of those. The New 2000 2 door convertible is a sporty car that is loved by all people who like power.
The corvette has a horsepower of 345 and a rpm of 5200. The engine type is gas and it has 8 cylinders.

The corvette also has a 5.7 liter engine and the inside can fit 2 people. 
The weight of the car is 3,248 pounds and its overall length is 180 inches.

While driving your corvette in the city you would get 17 miles per gallon and when on th highway 25 miles per gallon. 

The base price on the 2000 corvette is 45,555 but the total target price is 48,000.  

The corvette is available in 3 models which are the 2 door convertible which I recommend, the 2 door coupe, and the 2 door hardtop. New standard features for this year are keyless entry system, and 5-spoke forged aluminum wheels.

The 2000 corvette is a car that when your driving you will be noticed.<br><br>
