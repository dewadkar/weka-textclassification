            I have leased a 1999 Envoy for 18 months and have driven it 25,000 miles.  The ride is the softest I have experienced in any mid sized SUV.  Because it is so soft, the vehicle tends to feel extra top heavy in turns (I am a little biased because I have driven a sports car--300ZX for the last ten years so anything soft in a turn may feel uneasy to me).
The seats are leather and very comfortable and the heated feature, was a luxury that has become a necessity.
The sound system is very good--above average.  The performance in deep snow is probably similar to any four wheel drive.  The cargo space is adequate for travel and trips to the home improvement stores--also good in a relocation.
The deal I got was outstanding because GM was still in the promo mode and kept the residual high to keep the payments as low as possible.
I have had only one very minor problem that isn't worth describing.
I highly recommend this vehicle, unless you want a sportier/stiffer ride.
