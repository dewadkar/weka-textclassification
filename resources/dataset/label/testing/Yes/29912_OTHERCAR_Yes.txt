              My Wife and I bought our 1995 Sunfire SE back in the Summer of 1997 and it has lived up to everything that we hoped that it would.  We were in DIRE need of a vehicle at that point in time so we really couldn't afford to be too picky on what car we got, as long as it was mechanically sound.  we didn't however, want a big gas guzzling boat of a car that looked like it belonged in a museum.  We perused the car lots and had no luck so we Started calling around outside our &quot;area&quot; and one dealer guaranteed that he had &quot;our&quot; car sitting on his lot.  Well we have probably all heard something similar to this but what the hay as I said we were hard pressed for a decent vehicle!

  We spent over 4 hours on that car lot that day, going over every car on the lot.  We finally narrowed it down to the Pontiac Sunfire SE. At first I wasn't too thrilled with the placement of the headlights and front facia of the car but eventually they &quot;grew&quot; on me.

  As far as handling and performance go, it handles it self remarkably well considering that it only has a 2.1L Four Cylinder engine in it, but the 5 Speed manual transmission helps out in the acceleration area. This car holds the road unbelievably well going in and out of twists and turns even in wet conditions.

  We haven't had a whole lot of expense involved with this car; other than routine preventative maintenance, so far we have had to replace the head gasket once (at 87,000 miles), the water pump, and we had to &quot;tack weld&quot; a pin into place on the cam of thee Windshield Wiper motor as it seemed to work its way out on several occasions before that (making the wipers just sort of sit in one spot and &quot;shutter&quot; pathetically).  And right now it is in bad need of a front end alignment (thanks to the rough roads in our area).

  The biggest problem that we have with this car at the present time is the Insurance premiums, for some odd ball reason Insurance costs more on thee Pontiac than it does on our 1994 Mustang. (weird eh?!?)<br><br>
