            Every time I place my 11 month old baby girl in my Suburban, I feel I am placing her in one of the safest vehicles around. Not only is the Suburban sturdy and tough, but it is also very accommodating (size-wise) to all of the &quot;stuff&quot; one has to bring with them when they have a family. The Suburban is one of the lower priced SUV's on the market, but has all of the luxury of any luxury model SUV...rear seat climate control, leather seats that envelope you in softness, and good looks too. My Suburban drives well, and I have not had any mechanical problems with it thus far.<br><br>
