            Buying a car from Saturn is a totally different experience from any other car dealer I have ever dealt with. When I walked into the dealership one afternoon by myself and said that I had seen their ads and wanted to try out a Saturn, the salesman first wanted to know what kind of driving I did, how many passengers I usually had, what were my needs as far as cargo room, then he showed my some cars in the showroom and explained safety features, etc. Then he asks if I would like to take one for a test drive. I say yes and he tells me that if he can make a copy of my drivers lic. that I can be on my way. For the first time ever I went for a test drive without the salesman. It let me put the car thru it's paces like I actually do drive sometimes. Well I was pretty sold after the test drive, but then had to convince the rest of the group.  

Did the research, test drove other cars, and in Feb, 1999 bought a Saturn SL2, blackberry in color. The car now has 10,600 miles on it, with an average gas mileage of 31 mpg. This is mostly my commute to work which is a true mix of highway and stop and go city. For road trips mileage has been 34-35 with 4 passengers and luggage.

Would I buy a Saturn again, YES!! YES!! <br><br>
