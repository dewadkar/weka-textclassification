            When Peugeot brought the 405 to the US market back in 1988, I remember my immediate interest in it.  Knowing that Peugeot was not the first choice of European cars for most Americans, I was drawn to the 405 Mi16 for that exact reason. I first test drove one in '91, and found it to be an incredibly enjoyable car to drive.  Flexible engine, smooth 5 speed (if a bit long in the throw), and probably the best combination of ride and handling I've ever felt in a front wheel drive car.  At the time, having a car that suited my needs, it was not a viable purchase.  I vowed to find one once I DID have the resources.

The car I wanted appeared in January of 2000, an '89 red Mi16 with only 75K on it...and I made the crazy jump of buying it before even driving it.  What at first seemed like a crazy decision turned out to be one of the most enjoyable investments I think I've made in a car. I bought the car for next to nothing, and drove it home (wondering if it would get me home, which it did), and spent time and money on upgrading the car's suspension, bushings, exhaust, and a few switches and sensors here and there.  I was also able to locate a full set of 15 inch rims, which I had restored and put on the car, and got a set of customized floor mats.  A few coats of Connolly Hide Food on the leather, and a few coats of Zymol wax on the paint, and the car looks almost new.

Everything works, and the car has been completely reliable since the work was completed.  Everything works, and the car has never stranded me. The interior build quality is my only issue, as it does rattle quite a bit, but I plan to conquer the rattles one by one this year. 

Today, I have a car that attracts more attention because of its condition and uniqueness on the road, and provides a level of driving satisfaction that is rare in a four door car. I plan to keep it for a long time, as it does everything incredibly well!

I think the US Euro-car buying consumer missed a real opportunity here.  Peugeot makes some of the most competitive automobiles in the world, and the 405's replacement, the 406 is a stylish, highly competent auto...I'm sure if the coupe version was sold here, it would sell well if the retail channels were strong.
