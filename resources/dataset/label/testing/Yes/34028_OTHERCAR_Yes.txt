            This is the first digital camera I have owned.  I've had a Nikon SLR for many years.  When I purchased a digital camera, I was looking for one with many of the features that I was used to with my SLR, while still able to function in an "auto" mode to allow other to pick it up and use it without a training class.

The S30 fit the bill nicely.

It is a very compact and sturdy camera.  It isn't small enough for me to put in my pocket, but just barely.  It feels very solid, especially given the metal/plastic case.  A lens cap is built in and turns on the camera when retracted.  All of the controls are well laid out.  The camera has a 4-way rocker controller which takes some practice to get used to.  The LCD display is very bright and clear, though a bit reflective.

The quality of the pictures is outstanding.  The S30 has a 3.2 megapixel CCD.  The color and sharpness of the pictures produced have been great.

The camera has a viewfinder, which does not cover all of the image, and doesn't seem to be completely centered.  I'd recommend using the display, or lots of practice, when composing shots.  It has a 3x optical zoom, and a 10x digital zoom.

The battery is small.  This is good for portability, but bad for battery life.  Not to say that it is terrible, but for a full day of shooting you probably will want a second battery.  A charger is included.

The S30 comes with a USB cable for connecting to your computer, and an AV cable for connecting it to your television set.  It can use both Type 1 and Type 2 CompactFlash memory cards, and officially supports the IBM Microdrive.  

The menus are easy to navigate.  There are many options on this camera - many pre-programed modes, along with a fully manual operation mode.  Any settings you would expect to find on a higher-end camera are here.  The AUTO setting works fine for fire-and-forget usage.  There are even some nice features, like a stitch mode in the camera which helps you take perfect panorama shots.  The S30 also takes movies.  These are fine for limited use (30 seconds at high quality) but it definitely won't replace your video camera.

The S40 is basically identical to this camera except for the 4 megapixel CCD and the price.  The S30 is a much better value.

All in all, this camera is a great value for the price.  It takes great pictures and has lots of features.  I highly recommend it for someone who wants more than a point and shoot camera, but doesn't need a pro-sumer camera.
