            This is truly a must for families apart.  The versatility of this camera is awesome.  You can snap studio quality photos in an instant and minutes later e-mail them to family members. The camera can instantly be set to movie mode an you may shoot a 60 second mpeg that can easily be attached to an email an sent from coast to coast.

The camera is very easy to set up and record to a mini disc.  This disc will fit in any modern (post 1993) computer and transfer the image to your P.C.  There is also software that accompanies the camera that allows transfer via USB port.  The software also offers photo editing which includes printing aspects.  

The setup of the camera is very user friendly and can be accomplished by any novice computer user.  The features on the camera are endless and can intrigue the most extensive camera buff.

The downside of the camera is the price tag. The camera I got cost  $995.00 from www.ecost.com.  This may seem a little exuberant but you truly get what you pay for in a digital camera.  You may find digital cameras from other manufacturers for cheaper but the cost of memory stick and add-ons will cost you more in the long run.

I cannot recommend this camera enough and once you overcome the price I am sure you will be happy.
