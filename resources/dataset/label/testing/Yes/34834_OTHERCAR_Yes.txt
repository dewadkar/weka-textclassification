            We have two teenagers and our 11 year old station wagon wasn't cutting it on trips anymore.  So last November, we went minivan shopping.  Our two choices were the Toyota Sienna and the well-liked Honda Odyssey.  The Toyota was nice, but it rode like a truck.  As for the Honda, we would have to commit to buying one according to one dealer.  However, another dealer had a demo that we got to test drive.  After the test drive, we were hooked.  The car was powerful, handled well, and was the closest thing to our wagon as far as turning radius.

We held off until March to place our order.  It was supposed to take 2 or more months for the car to arrive (we wanted it by Memorial Day).  Well, at the end of April, the dealer called and said that somebody couldn't take delivery of an Odyssey of the exact same color we got.  We were offered to take it, and we did.

The ride is great.  The Odyssey is more like a car than it is like a truck, so it doesn't lean a lot.  The engine picks up like none I have ever experienced.  It is so quiet, you may not realize it's on.  The transmission abruptly downshifts on hills.  It took some getting used to.
As for the interior, it is spacious and well-equipped.  The center tray is a life saver for trips (no more spills on the lap).  The A/C vents work well and the radio is good for a minivan.  The third seat can be folded down, and believe me, you have a lot more space when the seat is down.  We have carried plywood and even a string bass in the Odyssey.  

Our two biggest complaints are the doors and fuel economy.  The doors work great, except they are a slight annoyance.  You have to have the car in Park and the doors unlocked to operate the doors.  Otherwise, it beeps at you. Once, the door wouldn't lock in place (we fixed it by cleaning the contacts) and the door stopped midway another time (there is a auto-reverse feature like in garage doors).

The fuel economy has been anywhere from 15 to 22 MPG.  We have been told that the fuel economy will improve as we get more miles on the car.  The great thing, especially with the high gas prices, is that we can use regular instead of high test.

Overall, this car is the best minivan in the pack that money can buy.  Believe me, it's worth the wait and the cost.

ONE YEAR UPDATE: This car is about a year old now and is still going strong. We have taken several long trips in our Odyssey and they couldn't have been better traveled. We have even reached 28 MPG (all highway driving for 300 miles).  Our only gripes are the doors (the door ajar alarm sometimes goes off spontaneously and the doors have to be turned off to disable it) and the accelerator (it sticks a little because of carbon buildup). Otherwise, this car has impressed us and will hopefully continue to do so for many years to come.
