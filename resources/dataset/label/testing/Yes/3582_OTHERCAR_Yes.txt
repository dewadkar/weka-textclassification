            My first digital camera (bought summer 2001) was the Canon G1, which, at 3 megapixels, was the top of the line for its time.  I had read on various digital photography forums that the G1 suffered from some limitations, especially in its ability to render color and skin tones naturally, and it's relatively unsophisticated metering system.  But I was impressed with the on-line galleries of some photographers and took the plunge.  Soon after the G2 was released, and the word spread that Canon had remedied the major shortcomings of the G1, making a wonderful new camera.  I became a true believer when, in Hawaii on a group trip, I had the opportunity to do side-by-side comparisons in the field of the performance of my G1 and a friend's new G2.  The G2 pictures were BEAUTIFUL, full of vibrant, rich color, natural skin tones, and great adaptability to low-light situations like sunsets.  I sold my G1, bought the G2, and am thrilled.  Canon took a good product and made it excellent.  (If it sounds like I'm parroting lots of other reviews out there, you're right.  I did lots of research before buying!)  

I love the rechargeable batteries, which last even longer in the G2 (they use the same BP-511 model), and the beautiful design.  The new three-zone selectable auto-focus and new evaluative metering program are great improvements, as is the enhanced manual focus tool.  Don't overlook the G2's "raw" file format, which allows you to save extremely high quality files that you can later apply your choice of white-balance, contrast, etc. to.  I don't particularly like the Canon zoom-browser software (included with camera), but there is a third-party product called Breeze Browser available on the net that works great.  (Get a compact flash card reader to connect to your computer, and forego connecting the camera directly to the computer.)

And you can grow with this camera!  As you learn more and more, take pictures with all settings manually chosen.  Then, trade up to a Canon SLR (currently very expensive), some of which use the same battery and compact flash as the G2.

Hope this helps!
