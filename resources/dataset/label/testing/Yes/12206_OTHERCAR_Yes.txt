            I bought this car used for my wife to use as a work car, and it has quickly become the most popular car in our family.  The maintenance cost has been minimal, and the gas mileage is very acceptable for a luxury sedan.  The 3.8 liter engine offers a nice mix of quiet reliability and power.  I really like the large dash that allows me to place road maps, coffee cups, etc. within easy reach while driving.  I have owned other luxury sedans by Oldsmobile, Mercury, etc., but this is by far our hands down favorite.  This car is just a pleasure to both drive and be a passenger in!<br><br>
