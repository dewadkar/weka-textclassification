            I never was attracted to the original 1989-1997 Miata--it looked too much like a toy to me, and its inspiration from the Lotus Elan didn't help matters because I didn't think much of that car either.

But when I first saw photos of the 1999 Miata in Automobile Magazine in December 1997, I was excited. In previous months, I had seriously considered a 1998 BMW Z3 1.9 and was really close to submitting my order to my local BMW dealer. But the 1999 Miata's new bodywork was more mature than its original's and the top-up appearance was more attractive than the upright tallish Z3 with its top up.

In January 1998 I put down a deposit for one of the first 1999 Miatas to arrive at my local Mazda dealership. In February, a few base models arrived as teasers/demonstrators and I compared one of these with the Z3 1.9 which was still in contention in my mind.

The BMW Z3 1.9 was a good car. I enjoyed its teutonic engineering which gives it a substantial feeling. I also appreciated the amount of standard features and thoughtful list of options, such as the wonderfully-snug sport seats, heated seats, traction control, and Harmon Kardon stereo system. And the icing on the cake was BMW ownership prestige.

But it came at a premium price. The sole reason I drove home in the Miata was because of its price. The Z3 1.9 with my selected options came to $33,000 while the Miata came to $26,000: that's a $7,000 difference, and when both cars had the same 140-horsepower 4-cylinder engine, the sound choice was the Miata.

However, for the 1999 model year BMW dropped the 1.9 4-cylinder model and replaced it with the 2.5-liter 6-cylinder engine (illogically designated the 2.3 model) for an negligable additional $500. If my car buying decision could have been delayed for six months, I would have justified the additional $7,500 for getting a 6-cylinder engined Z3 and driven home in the BMW instead.

Still, the 1999 Miata has some unique strengths over any Z3 configuration. The Miata's manual transmission is a benchmark of short-shifting delight. Gears are engaged with a snick-snick mechanical precision, and the short throw inspires race car experiences. The suspension setup feels extremely connected to the road and go-kart-like. The diminutive dimensions are part  of the formula for a very quick reacting car. It is also very tossable without having a lot of horsepower which helps make it more controllable when the rear swings out.

Put the top down on a sunny day, find a curvaceous road without traffic, and this Miata will sing its praises.

But the real world experience is less delightful. As a daily driver in a metropolitan area, the Miata is quite a chore. The seats are narrow and unsupportive with almost no bolstering (similar to the Z3's standard seats). You feel like you're sitting atop them, not in them. After an hour, they become extremely uncomfortable. The small confines of the interior don't help matters much either. The center console packaging causes my right leg/knee to rub uncomfortably against it while driving (and I'm only 5'8&quot;). The center console armrest is covered in hard plastic rather than a more comfortable padded leather. Heated seats and traction control are not offered as options, which further lessen its use as a true 4-season roadster.

Sure, some will argue that there are aftermarket solutions to answer my concerns, but I prefer to compare apples-to-apples. If the competition offers factory-grade solutions, why can't Mazda? Consumers will pay the premium prices, if that is Mazda's only concern, as the thriving aftermarket of Miata enhancements proves.

In summary, the 1999 Mazda Miata is a very good roadster. It is a sound investment, requiring only gas and oil (like any typical Japanese car) for maintenance. But to many car enthusiasts, car ownership is more than just rational decision-making, and while the Miata has plenty of soul, it certainly isn't without faults. With plenty of choices in the roadster marketplace, I'd advise in considering all of them carefully before making your final decision. The new-for-2000 Toyota MR2 Spyder has become the Miata's first true competitor in both performance and price. The MR2 looks and feels like a cheap Japanese imitation of the Porsche Boxster, but in this low-cost roadster realm, the Miata is still the popular favorite. Compare for yourself, but I suspect the Miata will win you over in the end.<br><br>
