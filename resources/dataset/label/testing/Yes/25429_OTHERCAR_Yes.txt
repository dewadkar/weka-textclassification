            I bought my Saturn in 1998 because I wanted a &quot;sports&quot; car without the expense of payments and insurance.  I looked at a lot of different cars, including Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Lexus (one can dream).  Most of their &quot;sports&quot; cars were way out of my price range.  However, the Saturn SC2 looks very sporty, is pretty inexpensive (the SC model is even cheaper) and the whole buying experience was wonderful.  They aren't kidding about the no-pressure sales tactics.  I was free to look around and ask questions when I needed to.  No one bothered me at all.  The car has been a dream!  I actually purchased a service plan with my lease, so for the entire 3 years of the lease, I can just drive the car to the dealership and they do all my oil changes, tune-ups, etc. for free.  Not to mention the free car wash that's included.  I highly recommend the service plan, especially on a leased vehicle.  There are a couple of things about the car that are minor annoyances.  Sometimes my automatic trunk release doesn't work, the glove box is hard to close, and the gear shift box doesn't light up, making it hard to tell what gear you're in in the dark.  I really love the running lights, the trunk is huge and the windshield wipers have tons of choices (hey, I like it!).  The car rides really well too.  It has excellent pick up and handles corners really well.  For a 4-cylinder, it sure feels like a sports car.  I would recommend the SC2 to anyone who is looking for a sporty, safe, fun car.  It's definitely not for families though, since it's a 2-door model and the back seats are a little hard to get in and out of.  For all the features I got and the service plan, my payments are only $200 a month.  Insurance on this car is cheaper than it was on an 89 Jetta.  It would be pretty hard to find a better deal in my opinion.<br><br>
