            I am 17 years old and I got my dads saturn when I got my liscense.  We bought in 1993 just after it came out because it was the new craze then.  Overall this is a very good car.  There are about 117,000 miles on it and it is still running.  The only thing about it that I don't like is that small things go wrong with it.  Since I have been in school from august through november, my car was in the shop 4 times.  It was nothing big but we had to pay at least $100 each time.  Once was the alternator, another time was the fan belt and then the wipers and then the engine mount.  One good thing about Saturn is the exterior.  You can throw baseballs at and it won't dent.  This is a good feature to have especially if the car is for a first time driver.  Saturns are very inexpensive and somewhat reliable.  It is not a luxury car and is probably not meant for someone who buys cars for looks.  It is very practical and durable.<br><br>
