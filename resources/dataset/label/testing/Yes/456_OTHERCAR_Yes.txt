            We got this camera after a lot of on-line research.  In this price range and with optical zoom, it came down to the Kodak CX6330 or the Fuji A210.  The sales person talked us into the Kodak.  We are very surprised at the quality of this camera.  It takes excellent pictures in all situations so far (using the lcd - they were not so good using the view finder - could be operator error?).  We are just your average picture taking family, so can't really dissect the different color saturations or exposure compensations.  It has just taken some great pictures in all the situations, night, day, inside, macro.  Even the video was of good quality.

This camera does not have a lot of manual adjustments (which is probably good for me).  It does have exposure compensation, but honestly the automatic mode has been excellent so far.  It has a couple different scene modes for different circumstances (sports, night, landscape).  It has a few settings for the flash (red eye, fill, auto). It also has a burst mode for taking 4 consecutive pictures. 

The menu system is very user friendly and self explanatory.  The camera in all is very easy to operate.  My wife and I were taking excellent pictures within minutes.  As stated above, I wasn't getting very good pictures thru the view finder, but thru the lcd they were excellent.  I think it was that I was moving and not keeping still.  The software is a snap.  It transfers images and pretty much does everything for you.  Red eye is easily removed.  Pictures are automatically scaled back for e-mail.  You can even set up albums and upload to the camera so that your pictures can be organized before you even download to the pc.  Very user friendly.

I must say after all the reviews I have read about battery life, I went out and bought a charger with 4x NiMh batteries right away.  Much to my surprise, the alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted for about 4-5 days.  We took about 100-120 pictures, 3x 1 min. videos, hooked the camera to the TV and did a slide show, played the videos and recorded another video while hooked to the TV.  The point here is that we played with this camera alot.  We just kept it off until we were ready.  We kept the lcd off until we were ready to take a picture and the battery life to me seems quite acceptable.  It should even be better with the NiMh batteries.  The only complaint would be that the battery indicator never came on (but my wife had control of the camera at that point - maybe she just didn't see it?).

All in all this camera has surpassed all of my expectations to include battery life.  We are very please so far.  It seems well constructed.  I like the automatic retractable lens cover.  The entire layout is great.

I could list some negatives here, but what this camera doesn't have - I knew it when I purchased it.  So who's fault is that?
