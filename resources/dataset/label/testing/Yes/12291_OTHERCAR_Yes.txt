            Wow....woah.....

Seeing the preview of this car in magazines a few months ago made me second guess Mitsubishi's decision on marketing this car from its concept design.  However, I no longer question them any longer.

This car really grows on you.  I don't know why, but it sure looks a lot better in person than in the picture.  I guess its not very photogenic.

Why I say its a 3000GT in disguise is because it shares the same 3.0 Liter Engine that its older brother 3000GT use to have (before it got deported).  I know it doesn't have the VR-4 Twin Turbo, but I'm sure a four wheel drive, or perhaps turbo edition may be in store later on like the GT-S in the past.  

If you are considering buying this car, MAKE SURE you get the V6.  This engine is super smooth, and the acceleration is swift.  Although it doesn't give you the kick that the old turbo editions did, it will bring you 0-60 in great comfort with little loss in time compared to the old turbos.  These rascals are only 5hp less than the old cars, and think of all the aftermarkets you can put on this guy.  Also, the manual has very short shifts which makes it sporty along with other sporty aspects such as the three spoke steering, aluminium fueling cap, and in my opinion, elegant spoiler.  If you prefer the automatic, the shifter is very cool with a crome base.  It also has a shiftronic where you can sorta cheat your way into being half way manual.

Other pluses for this car is the ENORMOUS moonroof compared to other compact sports cars, and it's very well designed interior.  Not to mention that it has 17&quot; Wheels (on the GT), and very large discs behind them for effective stopping.

The only complaint I have is that the rear seats are still too small.  But they are a BIG improvement from the past.  I can fit in there without having bend my head 90 degrees.  And the engine noise is excessively loud.  Its not a very pretty sound either, but at least it lets you know that your engine is working.......right??

This would be great for a second car because its not very practical other then fun or letting our aggressions and stress.  However, with so little Japanese sports cars left (they keep dissapearing =( ) you better get your hands on this one.
