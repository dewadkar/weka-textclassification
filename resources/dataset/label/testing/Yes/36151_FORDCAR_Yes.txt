            I am a "car guy"!  Unlike many car guys/gals who can seem almost militant in their devotion to their favorite cars, I believe I keep an open mind when evaluating cars other than my favorite brand, which coincidentally happens to be Ford (incidentally, I currently own Nissan and Acura products).  I try to keep up on all the latest trends in personal transportation, and when my friends and family need info on cars, they know they can count on me for an honest opinion.  I recently helped some close friends buy a new compact car, and after trying out and evaluating several products from all around the world, they bought a Ford Focus.

For those of you who follow automotive trends, you may have noticed that American carmakers have dramatically improved the quality and variety of their products in the last 15 years.  In my opinion, Ford has done the best job of designing interest, excitement, and quality into their vehicles.  The new Ford Focus is proof positive of this.

Ford has created a new standard for the economy car with this vehicle.  The Focus is a spacious, comfortable mid-size car on the inside, and a fuel-sipping zippy compact machine on the outside.  It's fun!  Headroom is particularly impressive in this car, and the upright seating is easy on the back and legs on those long trips.  I could definitely survive a road trip in the back seat - wouldn't want to try that in most other small cars.  The dashboard is straightforward and friendly.  All the knobs and switches have an expensive feel to them - kind of what you'd expect in a much pricier car.  Even the fake wood trim is more convincing and less offensive than you typically see in American cars - personally, I'd rather not have it though.

Engine and suspension performance is at the top of the class, neck and neck with other top economy cars, such as the new Nissan Sentra and the Mazda Protege.  Although engine noise is pronounced under hard acceleration, it is not offensive the way a lesser car might be.

Ford doesn't skimp on the standard features (although they should make side airbags standard rather than an option), and the fresh look of the Focus makes it stand out among most other economy cars - love or hate it, it gets noticed.  Ford offers enough variety in the way of trim levels and options to satisfy most anybody.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a fun, reliable small car that drives like a more expensive, bigger car.  Focus on a car in a flavor other than vanilla!

(JULY UPDATE) - I'm happy to report that my friends couldn't be more pleased with their choice of the Focus.  After several months and several thousand miles, they find the car to be a joy to drive.  They are particularly impressed with the handling in all weather conditions, and told me that the car inspires great confidence!

(APRIL, 2001 UPDATE) - My friends still love their Focus, and have had no problems to date!  I'm going on vacation next month, and went out of my way to set up a five day rental on a Focus, so I'll add more after I've spent some time in the rental...
