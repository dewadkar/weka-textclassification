            I have tested several types of digital cameras for a departmental purchase.  In total we needed 10 cameras which would be easy enough for university faculty to use, and were sturdy enough to take out into the field.

The SONY Mavica's stood out right away because of one important feature: the pictures you take are immediately stored on a disk! No special memory modules to buy, no transferring with cables to pc's, nothing!  In standard graphics mode it will place about 45 pictures on a regular floppy disk.  The quality of the pictures is good enough for most household purposes.  In fine mode you can store about 25 pictures on a disk.  The picture format is JPG and JPG only.  

The menu on the camera is very intuitive and well thought out.  Within the menu are several options for trick photography (bw, reversed, sepia tone) which are pretty nice to have.  Also included with the camera were a flimsy carrying bag and a wide angle lens.  Both don't work too well.

The Mavica Cameras were all bought through CDW for around $699 each.  We have had several older Mavica's in service that have performed great over the last two years.  We have had one malfunctioning floppy drive in one of the cameras, which was no longer covered by warranty.  That was $250 to fix...  Other than that I have been very happy with the Mavica's <br><br>
