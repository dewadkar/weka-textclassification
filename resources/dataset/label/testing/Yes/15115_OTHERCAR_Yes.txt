            I had a 95 Altima, it got total in a crash, and now I have a 99 Altima. This is a great car to drive, a little car with some power packed into it. Mileage is also great on this car. I get about 26 miles per gallon on the freeway. 
My car drives well, it's very responsive. Though some people do get turn off because the steering is quite sensitive compare to other cars. 
The car isn't very roomy in the back, 3 adults can fit in but not much leg room. That isn't the problem for me since it's only my husband and I most of the time. 
I really prefer the GXE model because it's usually the one you can get a great deal on. It comes with CD player, air, power locks and windows, cruise control and much more. I paid the same amount for my 96 model and my 99 model, both were purchased new. 
I think anyone in the market for a compact car should take a test drive at least. I bought both of them the same day I test drove it. <br><br>
