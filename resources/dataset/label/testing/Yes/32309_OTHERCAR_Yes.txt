              The Nissan Sentra SE models are the only Sentra i reccomend, (excluding older se-r models) Because they are basically mini maxima's many people dont recognize the sentra se or se-limited models as sentra's at all, most people think it is a 200sx se-r (which it shares the same chasis,wheels,interior etc. with) or i've even heard people say, thats a nice altima. The SE model sentra's exceed the other sentra models in every way, the 2.0 engine for starters will blow the doors off the standard 1.6 litre, interior is better/sportier, the addition of the side sill extensions makes it look alot more grand, and finally the wheel and tire package, smoked 15 inch 5 spoke wheels previously seen only on the 200sx se-r round the cars sporty appearance. If the maxima is famed as a 4 door sports car, then this car should definately share the same fame. if you own this car, or are concidering one, check out my website: Brian's Nissan Page; Home of the 1999 Sentra SE-Limited @ http://www.geocities.com/nissan99sel there is tons of pics, an engine modifaction table, readers rides, and you can even get your ride posted here, so come check it out!
