            I test drove the only intrigue '01 at the dealers lot.  I like to test drive cars on a Sat morning and see the new model year vehicles.
For a car they rant and rave about I felt it was very plain.  The engine was very quiet yet powerful but I just did not feel that punch when I put the pedal down even with the 220 HP v6 sibling engine of the v8 olds aurora.  The vents were very large and the A/C was quick to cool (then again it was only 70 degrees out)  The  instruments were large and easy to read but once again the dash was boring also. I like flashy and I will make my comparison to the Pontiac Grand Prix called &quot;American Power&quot; considering they are basically on the same platform.  The G.P. Has lots of switches bells and whistles and a unique red backlit dash that makes you think of a jet cockpit or something.  I could not say this for the intrigue.  It had leather seats that were very comfy and supportive but no seat heaters?  The dealer told me they were unavailable but I did read that they were.  HUM, what does that lead me to think?  The front of the car was very plain looking and I like the aggressive look of the G.P.  I only felt as if I was driving an &quot;older&quot; persons car and not an aggressive looking middle aged persons car.  The steering turned with ease with the magnasteer power steering system but I could not get a feel of the road when I turned the wheel.  It handled corners very crisply with minimal body roll and the braking seemed nice and tight.  The only thing I was intrigued about was its handling.  Yes and there was more than adequate head, foot and body room both in the front and rear and it was easy getting in and out of the car<br><br>
