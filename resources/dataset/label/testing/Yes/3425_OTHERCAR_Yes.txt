            I've owned this now for about 3 months and am mostly delighted with it.  The best thing is that it is so small and light that it's no problem to pocket it and go places.  Viewing pictures on a PC (or downloading) directly from the camera via USB is quick and easy and the camera's own LCD is fine.  The menu and operation is very easy and intuitive.  

I did some fairly careful comparisons between the different resolutions and sharpness settings and ended up using the "fine" setting with sharpness all the way down (it adds ringing and edge enhancement like effects) - this gives over 50 pictures on the built in memory which tends to be plenty for a weekend away etc. The best resolution setting gave very little advantage and halved the number of photos you can take.  Battery life is very good (I use NiMH batteries which almost always show as being nearly dead on the battery monitor on the display, but keep on going.)

My only real problem with the camera is that the colours are a little weak.  Whether this is to do with the CMOS sensor as opposed to the CCDs I don't know, but it tends to make fairly "washed out" pictures compared with most of the other cameras I have seen or used.  Contrast is OK, so I wonder if this is something that can be cured in firmware and later ones will be better?

Oh, and the flash is also very weak.  You can only take flash photos at a distance of about 2m - much further and it's too dark, much nearer and it's washed out.  

If you are looking for a camera that you can put in your pocket and just document things you've seen, it's great.  If you want it for quality photos, you may be better looking elsewhere.

Purchased in the UK, hence price in US$ is approximate (paid ï¿½115) and spelling of "colour" above is correct for English English :-)
