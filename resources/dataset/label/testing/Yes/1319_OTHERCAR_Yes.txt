            I recently bought a Honda Passport. I had heard they were good vehicles, had test driven this one a few times and seemed pleased with the performance. Now these are supposed to be opinions about the vehicle, so here is mine.  <br>All around the Passport is a great vehicle.  It had an affordable price range, many nice features.  &quot;Moon Roof&quot;, cd player, air conditioning, most things people look for in a car now days.  The vehicle also came with Anti-lock breaks.  <br><br>Well, one day I was driving in the rain. Through a town with streets I was very familiar with.  I turned a corner and a car was stopped in the middle of the road.  We were on an incline, so I used my breaks, assuming the anti-lock breaks would most likely come on. In the event of using the break, an odd sound occurred and the car shifted into reverse suddenly. I have no idea how this happened, but it did.  Instead of stopping I went backwards. I didn't crash, luckily, because when I hit the brakes again the car stopped. I was then able to shift back into drive and continue. <br><br>This doesn't sound like a very normal occurrence for a vehicle.  So I traded mine in for a different one, just because I was afraid of the same incident happening again.<br><br>I would possibly recommend this vehicle for most anyone. Unless you don't think you would do very well in dangerous situations, this car would be fine for you.<br><br><br>
