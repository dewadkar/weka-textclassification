            The reputation of Toyota building quality vehicles was an important factor in choosing the Prerunner. I had just sold my 1973 Chevy 4X4 and wanted another truck. Since I have not been going to extreme off road areas like I used to, I felt the Prerunner was a good compromise between my old truck and a wimpy, little import. Also, improved mileage was an important consideration.

I got the V6, TRD package, power windows &amp; locks, tilt wheel, cruise control, bucket seats, and as all Prerunners have, automatic transmission. 

The V6 has plenty of power, but the mileage is disappointing. I get 17-18 mpg running 75 mph on the highway. The 410 axle and large 10.50 tires surely cut the mpg down, especially at freeway speeds. The highest I have gotten was 20 mpg when it was new and being broken in.

I have not taken it on any major off road trips, but it drives and handles well on paved and dirt roads. On the highway it has some wind and tire noise, but not too excessive. The seats could be more comfortable for long trips. The extended cab is nice for securing items inside, but to seat someone larger than a 12 year old is a joke.

It is a very good looking truck. My wife wanted me to get a truck that doesn't look like a sissy truck, and she likes the way it looks. The ride is not as bad as an old straight axle 4X4, but is sure doesn't ride like a Cadillac either. A bump or pothole is definitely noticed.

The only problems I have had is a jerk when I am coming to a stop. I think it may be the trans downshifting, but it could be the brakes or a motor mount. I took it in once to have it checked and they could find nothing wrong. That is not surprising, considering the poor reputation Toyota has for warranty repair service. I will take it back a couple more times before it hits 36000 miles (it has 22000)and the warranty expires. Just recently the dashboard brake light started coming on when I accelerate when it is cold. I read another review that stated his came on during right turns and all it needed was brake fluid. I'll try adding some to see if that will fix it.

Overall, I am happy with my truck. But considering the purchase price and mileage, I would check out others also. As far as looks go, you can't beat it, especially in white with the black fender flares, bedliner, wheels, tires, and TRD graphics.<br><br>
