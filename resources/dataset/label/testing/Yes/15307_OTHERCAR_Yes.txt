            I have been pondering a digital camera purchase for quite some time now. The reason for my decision to finally go ahead and purchase one was that I needed a quick and more efficient way to capture photos for the internet, to send to family and to post on Auction sites.  I had been having photos processed... rarely capturing the image correctly the first time. I would find myself buying more costly film, taking more needless photos and paying a premium for processing.  As of late I had been spending $15.00 a pop on a photo disc.  I believe I have spent more money &quot;thinking&quot; about buying the camera than I did for the camera itself...!

  Debating their advantages and disadvantages...should I go with Kodak, Epson, Cannon, etc., I finally came upon the Sony Mavica series of cameras. I am the PROUD owner of a Sony digital MVC-FD83.

  I was overwhelmed at first, with the thought of all of the buttons and gadgets on the camera, but it is fairly straight forward and very convenient to use.  The &quot;film&quot; that is used is a 2HD floppy disc that can be purchased anywhere.   You are able to fit about 25 JPEG pictures on a disc and are also able to take up to 60 seconds of MPEG formatted video
(a great way to send a quick weekly family greeting to great grandma  across the country) This makes it very adaptable to use online and for Emails. 

  After taking the pictures you can immediately download them to your computer (quicker than getting your scanner to work). There are other effects such as sepia, black and white, negative art and solarize.  Now you can have a little fun with your photos as well. If, for some reason, you don't like what you see on the LCD screen /viewer then you can delete a photo on the spot.

  The battery, which is a lithium type, is rechargeable up to 80 minutes of run time. Much like today's camcorder's, where you can monitor your battery and know how much energy you have left,  the same is true for  this camera.   The camera will turn itself off after 3 minutes of non-use so as not to waist battery time.  

   Some of the features it has are a 6X zoom lens as well as macro for taking close-ups, auto focus and flash (both can be overridden).  A self-timing feature to allow you to join in  the still photo or 5-60 second movie. There's a tripod mount on the camera as well(as with most). It has the ability to copy a disc so that you can make a quick copy for a friend without having to do it on your PC so you will want a few extra discs on hand.  The camera itself comes with an A/V connecting cable to enable you to show slide shows on your TV.  Battery, charger, lens cover and strap.  Other options are available from the manufacturer such as a larger battery and  AC/DC adaptor.
 
  In all, it is very easy to use, fairly light weight, not too bulky, and very convenient in that the discs are readily available and inexpensive. 
Best of all, the photos are beautifully clear and colorful.

  If you are thinking about buying a digital camera and haven't yet made the plunge...I say &quot;go for it...get your feet wet&quot;.  Try the Sony Mavica.   Find one in your price range  ( price range for the series $450.00-$1000.00)

  I'm sure, several years from now, with technology moving at the speed that it is, this technology will be archaic and these cameras will be a quick grab item at the check out counter of your favorite convenience store but for now...I'm pleased as punch! <br><br>
