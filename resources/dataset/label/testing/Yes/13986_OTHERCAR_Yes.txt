            The Honda Accord LX is a great car to use on a daily basis.  It looks great.  It has a great gas mileage.  

I bought this vehicle because it looks great.  Both the interior and exterior are very attractive.  The price is also quite reasonable.  The mileage is outstanding.

This vehicle is easy to drive.  It is smooth.  Good pick-up speed.  What is bad about this car is that there are so many of similar Honda Accords around.

I think this is a great car for anyone who would like to have a reliable good-looking vehicle.  I recommend this Honda Accord to anyone who does not need a car to define his/her ego.<br><br>
