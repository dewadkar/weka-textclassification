            I bought a Mercury Sable LS 1992 in 1994 due to the price (under $12,000 and fully loaded with electric moonroof and all the amenities one would expect in a top of the line model).  It has had its normal wear and tear but I have been extremely pleased with its reliability as well as its comfort and design.

I have loved mostly the comfort of its right and its dependability in adverse weather conditions.  The seating is designed and electronically
adjustable for any comfort position the driver or passenger may desire.
It ALWAYS starts and has never given me a problem in winter weather (I live in Massachusetts).

The stereo system was the top of the line but I always thought it could have been better designed and reception could have been better. The moonroof is beautifully placed and a joy in good weather.

The V6 engine is now going on over 100,000 miles and has required no specific maintenance except for normal oil and regular scheduled maintenance changes.  

If I have one complaint with this model, it has been with the brakes.  They have required more maintenance than what I would have expected from a top of the line model.  Overall, I would rate the Mercury Sable a four and half star choice. <br><br>
