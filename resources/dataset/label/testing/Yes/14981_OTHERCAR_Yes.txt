            I am terrible at getting up to date photos of my children to my family which lives across the country.  This camera takes excellent pictures and I can load them into my computer and email them to my relatives.  It's easy to use zoom function lets me take close ups as well as full length pictures.  Aunts and Uncles and Grandparents can see the kids wearing the clothes they sent or see the toothless smile or the new hairdo within minutes of my taking the photo.  Also I don't have to worry about losing film, cost of developing and then not knowing if the pictures turned out.  It's a win/win product.  My family is happy and I save time and money with the ease of pictures on a floppy disk.  Great for parents of new babies so that far away relatives can see the precious bundle!<br><br>
