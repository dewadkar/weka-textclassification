            I purchased my Olympus 4 months ago.  It is my second digital camera.  The picture quality is great.  The cost of the camera was a little higher then I wanted to pay but well worth it.  With the camera and AOL I was able to send real time pics back to all my friends and family while touring Europe this past summer.  The features are very user friendly and allow even the novice photographer to take excellent quality pics.  Drawbacks are as follows.  The memory card that comes with the camera is too small.  For a small additional investment a larger card can be added.  This is highly recommended unless you want to carry your laptop to the top if the Eiffel tower to dump the pics to a hard drive.  The flash needs to be pulled manual and is easy to forget thus wasting a pic.  It needs a carry case that can be purchased separately but would be nice to come with the initial purchase.
The camera works very well in low light.  The software that comes with the camera allows some real interesting things to be done if you are at all creative.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone just getting into digital photography.
