            The Audi TT Roadster, the newest and by far the greatest car from Audi to this day , has all that is great in a luxury sports car.From excellent handling, to a sleek ,new look,the Audi is sure to make you the envy of all.Once being a concept car from Audi, it made it's way into the spotlight in 2000, with it's unveiling.At the time it was a one of a kind car, with the greatest new look on the market, it was praised to be an "elegantly sporty" car.Although since that time, many auto makers, have , or are currently in the process of making cars, which are trying to live up to the TT's standards, not to mention which practically steal it's form.They have , and will all fail miserably for there can be but 1 TT.Although the TT may be the greatest looking car out it does have it's flaws when it comes to racing.It goes 0-60 in 6.7 seconds, and it's top speed is only 130 mph, however, since street racing is illegal anyway, u should have no problem with that , and speed isnt everything.The TT has great handling and road presense, when u are behind that car u feel like you can do anything, and u just about can.All in all I believe that the TT is a great car, with great form , and at a great price, and i would recomend it to all.
