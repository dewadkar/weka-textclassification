            BUICK KICKS OFF NEW MILLENIUM WITH A SPECIAL CENTURY

Buick touts the Century as a family car, with the appeal and styling of a much more expensive sedan. In nearly six months of driving the Century 2000 Special Edition, the car continues to surprise and please us almost daily.

The ride, the interior, storage and accessories all have proven their quality and craftsmanship in the first few months of working the car into routine. First, let�s consider the ride. With a large six-cylinder engine, the Century demonstrates considerably more guts in acceleration that other autos its size. In sudden acceleration bursts, the vehicle surges ahead confidently, without hesitation, providing drivers with the confidence they need in congested highway driving.  Overall the motor is quiet, though it does sound throaty when you punch on the accelerator at times. The Century�s power plant seems ample for highway and city driving.  Steering is crisp and responsive. And the wide frame provides a smooth, even ride.

While the engine provides plenty of power, the interior provides ample comfort. The glove-like leather seats envelope passengers and provide enough legroom for a person 6� 3� to sit comfortable � with room to spare. Understandably, the Century�s back seat is tight when the front seats are pushed far back. But there is still enough room for children to sit comfortably.  The six-way power seats make it possible for tall drivers to sit without jarring their heads against the interior roof line.  

The interior�s best feature is its seating. The leather seating is comfortable and plush. The dashboard stands out for its simplicity and its convenience to controls. Steering-wheel-mounted radio and CD player controls convenient enable the driver to adjust controls without taking hands off the steering wheel. The radio plays well, with little static if any, and the CD player provides a consistent sound with barely a skip. The dashboard controls are easily within reach and conveniently laid out.

The dual-temperature controls work well � enabling a front seat passenger to warm up or cool air flow through the ducts on that sight of the car. The automatic thermostat works fine, if comes on when the sensor determines the temperature has shifted from the programmed setting. The air-conditioning is responsive, cooling a hot interior in Florida within a few minutes, and providing almost immediate relief to front-seat passengers.

One downside is the automation and sensors on the vehicle. While the lighting works just fine, it�s easy to forget to turn on your headlights � though they�ll come on automatically at the onset of darkness. The keyless entry can be optionally programmed, but the default enables driver and passengers to leave the vehicle at night with the lights on for 90 seconds � a nice feature in a dark area.

On the upside, the rear split fold seats make it convenient to reach into the trunk during a long trip and access a cooler or other belongings. And, speaking on the trunk, it�s huge. You can easily fit four medium suitcases and two large golf bags into that cavernous space.

The Buick Century 2000 Special Edition has exceeded our expectations, and provides a fine family vehicle for local and long-distance driving.
