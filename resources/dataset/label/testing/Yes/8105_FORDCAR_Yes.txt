            Well, my old SUV was beginning to run up the repair bills so I decided to look into a new SUV.   I'd owned a Mercury Mountaineer before, and it is the big plush version of the Ford Explorer.   Since I have another car, and rarely drive guests (other than one,) I decided the 2 door 2001 Explorer Sport might fit the bill.   Here's my opinion:

IS IT ROOMY ENOUGH?
For 2 people it is perfect!  The front bucket seats have a new dual-density foam that is really quite comfortable.  The driver's seat on mine is a 6 way power version, with manual lumbar support and I like it very much.  The headrest is adjustable, but not the best I've ever had.

In back, forget it.   Since this is the 2 door model, you'd have to slide the front seats forward just to get in/out, and that's a pain.  The rear seats themselves are ultra-low back split benches, with horrible headrests.   I cannot see myself riding in the back for more than a short trip.  Even if you put the kids in the back, I hope you don't need to fuss with a car seat.

HOW'S THE INTERIOR?
I chose a leather interior and think it is of good quality.  The dash and door panels are all plastic, but this is an SUV so that's o.k. with me.  There is a new &quot;silver/platinum&quot; color on the door pulls and consoles and it looks great, but may wear off sometime.  The instrumentation is pure FORD so if you like one you'll like them all.   Easy to reach and use controls from the driver's seat.   The speedometer/tachometer cluster is in white with red needles.  It glows a backlit green at night.  The steering wheel in mine tilts, and contains cruise control buttons  within it.

WHAT ABOUT THE ENGINE?
This year the Sport has a 4.0L Single Overhead Cam (SOHC) V6 engine.  Mine has a 5 speed automatic transmission with overdrive. (Manual transmissions will be available in late 2000.)   It has good pickup, with about 200 hp.  It's first scheduled oil change is at 5000 per the manual.
Passing on the freeway is no problem with this big car.

WHAT OPTIONS DID YOU GET?

6 disc in-dash CD changer:   This is a cool new toy, all 6 CD's fit in the single hole, then are moved up/down inside to play.  Much better than the old &quot;plug in cartridge&quot; type.   Very good sound, with 6 speakers.  It has DSP (digital signal processing) with such effects as &quot;Jazz Club, Stadium, News, Church,&quot; etc.   It has plenty of volume too.

Premium Sports Group: This is bigger tires/wheels, front tow hooks, fog lamps, and side step bars.   It mostly looks cool.

Convenience Group: Tilt wheel, Cruise control, Keyless entry fobs and keypad, Power mirrors with cool puddle lamps. (They shine down to show you what you'll be stepping out into...)

Leather Comfort Group:  Front overhead console (contains compass, temperature, sunglass/remote holder.)  High floor console (A MUST!!! otherwise you get a small removable &quot;tote&quot; made of ballistic cloth.)  Rear air conditioning and stereo controls, (ho-hum, who's gonna sit in those back seats?)  Great soft leather seats up front.

Skid Plates:  Covers the gas tank and transmission from rocks when using 4x4.  Only a hundred bucks more, why not have the protection?

3.73 Limited Slip Axle:  Did not really want this, but it was on there so I took it.  Don't know much about it.

SAFETY ISSUES:
It's got dual front airbags, with side-airbags optional.  It's a big heavy vehicle and think it would do fine in an accident. Anti-lock brakes are standard (and larger than last year's model.)  It could roll over, but does not feel tipsy when taken around a curve. (Just don't go too fast.)


SHOULD YOU BUY THIS CAR?
Not if you NEED a 4 door.   The back seats, to me, are only good to fold down and have extra cargo room. (Plenty of cargo room!)
If you can overlook the backseat problem, this is a lot of SUV for $19,000 to 27,000. (Invoice prices)

Since it's only June 2000, and the 2001 models are just out, I was only able to get invoice plus $300 - $400 for my best deal.  Wait a little while and you should be able to go below invoice by 2001 when buying this car.

Enjoy!
