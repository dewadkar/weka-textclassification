            Well when I first heard that a sports car from Toyota was hitting the market I immediately became pretty skeptical.  I mean, who really thought that a company whose greatness arose from minivans could actually  produce a magnificent sportcar.  I am now swallowing my skepticism.
After spending some time in the supra, this car should be renamed the &quot;supreme.&quot;  The first thing I noticed was the outward appearance, and while not exceedingly flashy, this car is very sleek, especially in red.  On ths inside, the car only gets better.  If loaded up, you will have a cd player, nice leather seats, and suprisingly, a lot of front leg room for anyone who is taller looking for a nice sportscar.  The acceleration is impressive, as I quickly found out picking up speed from a nearby red light.  Inside the car, the ride is fairly quiet, and the sound system is very nice, and this is coming one who is very particular about sound in his cars.
Bottom line - The supra is a great choice for anyone looking for an affordable sportscar, and dont be fooled by the maker.  Toyota shows its versatility with this bery nice new addition to its lineup.
