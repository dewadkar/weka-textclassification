            I decided to buy a digital camera about two years ago when I was really starting to sell a lot on ebay. I was getting tired of paying to develop pictures and then go through the hassle of scanning them. 
I was having a hard time deciding which one to buy, especially since I couldn't afford the high price tags of the top end cameras. I actually bought two different cameras and returned them before I settled on this Fuji camera. I've been extremely pleased with the value for my money. 
It's not a camera that will take scenic or panoramic pictures well, but for closeups, people, my kids, and ebay items, it does a perfect job. 
I especially love the LCD window that lets you preview the picture immediately and decide if you need to take another picture or not. 
Really, only two features on my wish list are lacking on this camera: a zoom feature and a removable storage device. However, since the camera can hold up to 64 pictures before it is full, that's like two rolls of regular film, not an insignificant number. Downloading the pictures to the computer is a snap, and so I usually transfer the pictures to my hard drive long before the storage limit is reached.
Really, my only gripe with this camera is way it sucks up the battery juice. I do have an AC adapter that I use when at all possible, but obviously that can't be used outdoors. 
Other than that,I have had no problems whatsoever. I've used it quite frequently for over two years now and it's still going strong. Considering the price tag, I think this Fuji camera gives excellent value for the money.<br><br>
