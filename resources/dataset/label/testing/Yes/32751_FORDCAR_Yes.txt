             You want a safe vehicle? Well the early 90's models are a terrific choice of transportation. I have a 1994, green, Ford F-150. I love how big and comfortable it is. Being in such a large, heavy vehicle makes me feel safer about driving and having my nieces in the truck with me. And the ride is very smooth and comfortable. There is only one problem that I have with this truck. It sucks up gas. I have dual tanks and I still have to fill up every 2 to 3 days. I use this truck to hall stuff like firewood, fencing, furniture, etc. But mainly I just go to school in it. To tell you the truth, the gas is really worth it. I love this truck and I hope you go out and get one TODAY.<br><br>
