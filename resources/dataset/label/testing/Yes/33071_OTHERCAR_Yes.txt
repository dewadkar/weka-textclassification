            I happen to own a 1999 Sonoma and love it!  Yes, it has a few downfalls.  I bought this truck because I wanted a truck with some power and carrying capacity.  One downfall is that you have to buy a truck with more options such as four-wheel drive to get power locks and power windows.  But the truck is just the right size to reach across and unlock the door and roll the window down.  One cannot be that lazy.  The Sonoma is not a truck for heavy duty pulling.  However, studies show that the truck can pull with ease though.  The truck has comfortable seating and many features that make up for those that are lacking.  I bought my truck more for the looks of it rather than the pulling capacity.  The truck is bumpy but the step-side model is more bumpy than the regular truck.  Anyone wanting a truck that handles well and looks sporty should buy a Sonoma. <br><br>
