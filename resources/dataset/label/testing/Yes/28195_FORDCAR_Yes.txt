            I own a 1996 Taurus and I just love it but in all fairness they do tend to have minor problems. They are more dependable than most other Fords except the Ranger and if you want to buy a Ford car, you better get a Taurus. My parents have Tempos, friends have had Escort-NO GOOD. Don't do it!!! Our 96 had 94,000 miles on it when we bought it in March but it hasn't had one problem yet. It also helps that if the dealership needs to sell cars bad enough, you can get an awesome deal on one. 
Depending on what options you can find (hard to do, it's used)it can be quite luxurious for a young family. It is a wildcard though. Ours has defrosting side mirrors and a folding back seat for extra trunk space, plus A/C, tape player, all the the usual.
I think I would recommend it to medium and low income families. It would be too big for a single and not well made or fancy enough for those with High Class Taste.
