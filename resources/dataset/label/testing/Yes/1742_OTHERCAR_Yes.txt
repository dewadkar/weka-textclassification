            I love the Firebird.  I bought a 1995 Firebird, my first sports car.  It has been my dream to own a sports car.  I bought the car for performance and looks.  I love the feel of the car while driving it, it is very smooth and handles great.  I feel like a teenager again when driving my car.

The biggest problems for me with this car is that it does have low ground clearance and I live in a rural area.  It is hard to go over rough roads and has limited vision from the front. It takes a while to get used to parking since you can't really tell where the front is. 

Tires seem to wear better than on any other automobile I've had.  With over 110,000 miles I am only on my 2nd set of tires.

When you need a little extra pick me up at a light or on a steep grade the power is there.

I would not buy this car for a teenager because it has too much power for a young driver and handling on a wet road is impossible. This is not a car for very large or tall people.  It is hard to get in and out of if you're even average height.  I am rather short so it is perfect for me.
