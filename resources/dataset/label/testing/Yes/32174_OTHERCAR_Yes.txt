            This is the second Cavalier I have owned (my 1996 Coupe was totaled and I bought this one to replace it) and I have been very very happy with both of them!!  For the price, you can't get a better car anywhere.  My car, loaded with all the options (except the aluminum wheels cause I didn't like them), cost less than the base price for a lot of other cars.

The number one thing I love about my Cavalier is the gas mileage.  I easily get 30 mpg on the highway, and about 25 mpg in the city.  With gas prices as high as they are right now, that is the biggest blessing!!  I also like the contour of the bucket seats, the power locks and windows, the cruise control, and the remote keyless entry.  And the steering wheel is very comfortable to hold.  The 1999 does not have an ashtray or a lighter, although there is the outlet where the lighter used to be.

One thing I miss from my 1996 Cavalier is the mechanical trunk release.  This is not a huge deal, but when the car is running the trunk release on the keyring remote does not work (to prevent the trunk from opening accidentally while you are driving) so you either have to turn the car off or get out and open it with the key.  Not a huge deal, like I said, but it was a little more convenient when the car had the release on the floor next to the driver's seat.

If you are looking for an economical, reliable, affordable car then the Cavalier is for you.  It is a great first car, and would also make a great car for families; although the 4 door would be better for moms who carry children.
