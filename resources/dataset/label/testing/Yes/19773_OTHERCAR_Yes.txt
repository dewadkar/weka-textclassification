<TEXT>
            In 1992, my father purchased a brand-new Subaru Loyale Wagon.  The dated two-box styling was not going to turn any heads, but the low price coupled with an impressive list of standard features sure did.  Dad was able to get a ruby red Loyale with power windows and door locks, air conditioning, AM/FM cassette, and roof rack for $9,999.  The only options our Subaru didn't have was all-wheel drive...a feature that soon became standard on the entire Subaru line, and automatic transmission--which no one in my family wants anyway.

<b>Interior</b>
The interior could best be described as pleasantly plain.  No faux-wood or leather here...just simple lines and durable fabrics.  The seats were not remarkably comfortable, though they got no complaints even on long trips.  The front seat was reasonably roomy for adults, and the rear was fine for children if a bit cramped for others.  The cargo area held a family of five's luggage on many occasions, and the roof rack was handy for holding a few extra bags.  The gauges were simply laid out and easy to use.  The factory sound system left much to be desired, as only two front-door mounted speakers supplied sound to the cockpit. Cruise control was not an option this model year, a feature that was sorely missed on long drives. The fabric on the seats was an excellent choice for this family cruiser, after four years and over 100,000 miles of use, they showed little wear and no stains.  

<b>Exterior</b>
As I have already stated, the outside of the Loyale was dated and boxy...from a design that originated in the mid-eighties.  The Loyale was available with black bumpers only, color-matched ones would have lent a more upscale feeling.  The factory hubcaps were an unattractive-generic design mounted on flimsy-looking thirteen inch wheels.  Changing these two things would have gone a long way on improving the Loyale's appearance, but as it was the car had a familiar, almost rugged feeling. The body panels seemed to hold up well to the inevitable door dings, our car had very few of them after years of being parked in cramped office-building garages...but the hood suffered from being the unwilling participant in several driveway games of basketball.  I have noticed that many older Subarus seem to rust prematurely...a problem our Loyale did not have, but others from this model year do. 

<b>Power and Performance</b>
If you can imagine two mice running on a wheel, you have a pretty good idea of the power the Loyale's four-cylinder engine produced.  Certainly no race car, the Subaru nonetheless performed adequately at highway speeds, if it did take a while to reach them.  As the car aged, its power decreased, but replacing several of the seals in the engine seemed to take care of the problem.  The five speed manual was stiff and definite, fairly easy to shift, and in light of the weak engine, the only way to go with this model.

<b>Reliability</b> 
In over four years and 100,000 miles the car never broke down.  At around 80,000-90,000 miles there was a noticeable decrease in the cars power, but this was corrected with a full tune up and the aforementioned seal replacement. Otherwise, the car continued to operate as new...with no failure of any kind. Steering remained tight, no new squeaks developed, and all of the interior features continued to work properly.

<b>Resale Value</b>
After dad fulfilled his dream of buying a Mercedes, it was time for the Loyale to go on to its new owners.  Nearly five years had passed since it was purchased, over 100,000 miles had been logged by the odometer, and the Loyale was bought for $4,000 by a lady seeking to use it for her daily 50-mile commute.  Not a bad return for a car that was in good, though not mint condition, and had above-average miles.

<b>Overall</b>
In spite of its wimpy engine and dated styling, the Loyale was an excellent car for the money.  It proved to be extremely reliable, roomy, and able to withstand the abuse heaped on it by a toddler, a new driver, and five West Virginia winters.  Well-kept used models should provide their new owners with years of reliable service.<br><br>
