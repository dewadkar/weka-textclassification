            The 2001 Chevrolet Corvette has to be one of the nicest sports cars on the market.  Personally, I did not like Corvettes until they came out with the 2000 model, so I have to commend the GM/Chevrolet company for coming out with this outstanding model.  It is a beautiful car.  Its sleek, aerodynamic body style helps it.  The best color in this car would have to be red or black.  

I have never driven one of these, so I can't tell you if they ride smooth. I do know, however, that Chevy makes great cars, so my guess is it rides great and handles well. The seats are very comfortable if you don't try to sit in the back. 

I recommend this car for people in the age range of 21 to 35.  You old hags don't need to be driving these.  I don't care if it's a midlife crisis, you'll get over it.  You just look stupid in these things and make the younger people that don't have them mad.

  The reason I don't recommend these for teens is because they aren't near responsible enough.  They would drive way too fast and end up wrecking it eventually, so you teens out there, stay away from them.  It is too pretty to end up in  a tree or the rear end of someone else.
