            The Honda S2000 with the hyper-revving 240-horsepower inline four, I was 
wondering, is this a race car rather than a road car??? Well, it is true 
that the S2000 requires more active involvement from its driver than 
some of the other roadsters on the market, but the 240 horses are 
accessible on the road, believe it or not. The styling is very striking. 
The 2.0-liter engine spins well over 8000 rpm, and the S2000 has one of 
the most direct and satisfying shifters in the business. Honda only 
imports 5,000 per year, so if you can get your hands on one, be quick.

But besides all these great qualities about the S2000, the S2000 may be 
a bit compact. So you don't mind being a bit couped up in the front, 
this is a great car for you.<br><br>
