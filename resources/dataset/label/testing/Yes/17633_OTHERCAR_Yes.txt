            This was my first experience buying a new car.  I did my homework, I researched the safety features, researched the &quot;professional&quot; opinions and then hit the lots.  Other car dealers tried to be my &quot;best friend&quot; and said that when I was ready they would make me a deal!  But the Saturn lot was different.  They told me about their safety features -- including hitting a new car to demonstrate the polymer side panels, he talked about the features of the different models on the lot-- pointing out the good and bad on each one, and then took me inside and showed me an industry book which compared all of the cars for sale.  Then it was time for a test drive.  I started out with the Dodge neon.  It was stylish but when it idled it was similar to my '91 Mitshubishi Mirage.  I just plain didn't like the Focus.  The I test drove the Saturn.  I drove the SC2 first.  I felt safe.  The car hugs the road and had good pick-up.  It cornered well and stopped when I wanted it to.  I then drove the SL2.  A good car but the handling was very different.  I noticed a big difference.  The response of the car was slightly delayed and the manuverability was not the same.

I love my Blackberry Coupe.  I love driving and I love the experience of buying a Saturn.  I would recommend it to everyone especially if this is your first new car.  It is sporty and economical at the same time.  If you are looking for a car you owe it to yourself to at least stop by the Saturn dealer---you will probably find yourself comparing everything else to the Saturn like I did.<br><br>
