                 There is no other words for a Mercedes Product than to AWESOME! Mercedes makes the best vehicle in the world, hands down. I've actually never owned one, but driven several Mercedes Benz.
     A friend of mine owns the C43AMG model. I had the car for two weeks while he was out of town on vacation, and wheeeeew!!! It was an unbelievable experience to say the least. He bought the car over across seas brand new, and had a turbo-charger added to it while he was over there. The car puts out an impressive 410 horsepower and 385 lbs ft of torque! It has to be the most quiet Mercedes I've ever driven, and for certain, the fastest. It hits it's 157 mph limiter very quickly on the highway, and takes corners like it's on rails. Mercedes certainly knew what the sports/luxury enthusiasts were looking for when they built this gem of an automobile. They took the sports part of it to a different level. The fuel economy leaves alot to be desired, but the performance far out-weighs any complaints in that regard.
     On the other hand, the car was extremely comfortable, very quiet, and has enough room to seat 4 adults quite well. The body lines, interior, instrument cluster, wheels, headlights, and tailights are unsurpassed as well. There is absolutely nothing about this car that I did not like. I even took a couple of days off of work, just so I could drive this car...
     I would recommend this car to anyone who can afford to purchase it, and to maintain it. Mercedes are generally a high maintenance vehicle, which requires some extra care, money and time, but all in all, are probably the most reliable car on the road. My friend's Mercedes has not been in the shop for anything except check-ups, and oil changes so far, and he has 39,000 miles on it now.
     The C280 I really do not care for, it seemed a little underpowered for my liking. It is a typical Mercedes though, quiet, roomy, and very comfortable to ride in on long trips.<br><br>
