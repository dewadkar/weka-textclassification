            Now we all want a powerfull car and don't want to pay a lot at the gas pump.  Well here is the solution.  I am writing a review on my 1991 Chevy Camaro RS.  It has a 140 HP 185 Ft LB 60 degree 3.1 liter V6.  It has a 5-speed manual (20-mpg).  It is a base model, the only options it has on it is an electric trunk and power steering.  For starters, the 3.1 V6 is a snappy engine(i have some mods IE Flowmaster exhaust, Jet chip)  I can, (with my old bald tires) get rubber in first and second gear (dry pavement) and First, second and third when it is wet.  I just got new tires and it cost me $315 and I havent gotten the courage to roast them off yet.  I have timed it to 60 and it will do it in 8.5 seconds with me driving.  The 5-speed Trans shifts very well.  I have 3:23 gears in the back (the highest ratio in a Camaro, most have 2:73) and that helps with my performance a lot.  The engine has 130,000 miles on it and it (believe it or not) doesn't burn any oil.  Chevy put a lot of craftsmanship into it.  As far as handling the road, it is just Ok, I need to get some new struts on the front (the old ones are tired) but even with the old ones it handles ok.  The interior is very tight in the back but very comfortable in the front if you are not too tall (I am 5-11 and I fit in it just fine but I am not very big).  The dash controls are not in the best places however.  Still leaves something to be desired.  I like my car and I think if you want a good performance / economy balance, get a V6 Camaro
