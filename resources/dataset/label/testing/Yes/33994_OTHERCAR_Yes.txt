            We started looking to replace our current SUV.  For us 4 wheel or all wheel drive is a necessity come winter.  We gasped when we began our discovery of what the car industry seems to have done to avoid the roll over tendency of SUV's since we got our last one.  My not too tall (5'11") husband could not sit up straight in many of the other SUV's, making them an automatic - no buy.  Apparently the roof has been lowered in many makes. That is, until we got into the Bravada.  Yes, there is even space for a ball cap for him.  

Of course that was just the start of the evaluation.  I am a real shorty, would the seats allow for me - you betcha, and for us the seat memory is very handy.  We took off on a drive.  Previously we have purchased manual transmissions even going so far as to special order them so that in the mountains we could use the gears rather than always wearing on the brakes.  The automatic in this transmission seems to have adequate gearing for both highway and those important fishing trips (it is all wheel drive) which are sometimes off road. 

As we drove out I was really impressed with a super smooth ride.  We had already driven at least 5 other makes of SUV's that day and this was the smoothest ride we'd had.  It has an automatic load leveling system and occassionally you can hear it adjusting with a very quiet sound.  The seats are very adjustable.  The one we drove had leather interior and is equipped with front seat heaters.  The front console does take up more room than in some SUV's and the shift is mounted from the floor.  The cup holders for the front seat are near the gear shift and adequate, but less convenient than some.  The console is roomy with space for a purse, or whatever.  There are other pockets for sunglasses and CD storage on the roof.  There are side pockets for maps also.  

The dash displays cover 2 trip meters, instant gas mileage read, estimated driving range on amount of gas remaining, timer.  There is a mounted recorder to take trip notes and an automatic dimming rearview mirror.  The side mirrors and even the radio can be programmed along with the seat memory for 2 passengers.  Heating and cooling can be set for passenger and driver separately and there are additional controls and vents in the back seat area for even distribution of heating or cooling.  Also, there is on star on the rear view mirror.  You do have to be careful not to hit that medical emergency button for on star while adjusting the mirror. One caution - if you are leary of high tech gadgets and don't like everything electronic and computerized this is probably not the rig for you. 
We ended up purchasing this rig.  It had been a "program" rig and already had 2,000 miles on it.

Since then we have used the seating at capacity when visiting relatives.  The back seat will hold two 6 foot plus adults in cushy comfort.  For older folk the back seat can be difficult to enter as seating is high over the wheel wells.  There is still plenty of head space and leg room in the back.  The middle of the back seat is not a true full size seating area.  So, if you are looking for a SUV that seats 5+ comfortably this one is not for you.  Also, the manual indicates a baby seat should not be used in the middle of the back seat.  Things to consider if you have a growing family.  The ride in the back does feel a bit less car-like but it is still really comfortable.  There are also separate radio controls and ear phone jacks for the back seat along with the heating and cooling controls I mentioned previously. 

The 4.2 liter engine is extremely responsive and acceleration and passing ability was superior certainly to others we had tried.  It seems to be getting 19 to 20 mph freeway and 16-18 city or stop and go driving.  It is still an SUV and will not corner like a sportscar, but it hold the road better than others that we drove with the exceptions of SUV's designed with a more car like lower body.  We have had no problems with it at all in the first month since buying it.  It is not a super large SUV, but roomier than some of the car like models.  Its smooth ride, I would rank the best of any of similar body design.  It also has fairly good clearance.  If I'm in the woods or off road I don't have to sweat it when there a a few rocks on the road.  

I am no safety expert, but the manual indicates there are both side and driver and passenger airbags and some reinforcement in case of rollover - I plan to never test these items out.  But you know the best of plans sometimes don't work out.  

All and all this is one very comfortable rig, with good pep and and exception smooth ride on and off road.  Pricing seems about comparable to other similar sized SUV's and I think this one is much more comfortable.  The exterior is very attractive (not as boxy looking as some).
