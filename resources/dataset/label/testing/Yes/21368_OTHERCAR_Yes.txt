            I recently purchased a used 1999 Camry LE with 47,000 miles on the odometer. I had been looking for a used 4-door vehicle under $12,000 and had also considered the Ford Taurus, Chevy Malibu and Honda Accord. I found the Camry to be smoother riding and tighter feeling than the Taurus and Malibu, and although I also liked the Accord, it tended a bit pricier than the Camry.

The styling of the Camry has been often criticized as being bland, but I think it has a certain understated elegance. It is not flashy, but my kids think it looks like a much more expensive vehicle. Even though this car is four years old, the paint and finish is excellent. 

The interior of the car really stands out from the others I considered. The front seats are very comfortable, and there is room in the back for three teenagers to sit with ample leg and elbow room. All of the controls from the heater to the power windows and locks seem to be laid out with ease of use in mind. The materials used in the interior seemed to be of high quality and the general feel of the interior is one of comfort and solidness.

The engine runs smoothly, and gets great gas mileage. I have been averaging about 30 mpg traveling over mostly country highways. One complaint I do have is that for a car of this size the 4 cylinder engine is a bit underpowered. My previous car (also a Camry) had a six cylinder engine and was much quicker. 

The only other complaint I have with the car is the stereo. My car came with the CD / Cassette player and I thought the sound was awful.I replaced it with a Pioneer CD player and am now happy.

All in all, this is a great car. It looks good, is very comfortable to be in and gets good gas mileage. My last Camry has 217,000 miles on it and is still going strong, so if this one can approach that one for reliability and longevity, I'll be more than satisfied.
