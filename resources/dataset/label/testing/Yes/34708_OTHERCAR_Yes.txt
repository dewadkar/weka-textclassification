            The trouble with most people is they buy one of these (new) for half the price of a BMW and expect it to be just the same. The good thing for you is that they then get rid of it and you get to buy it second hand for next to nothing.

Some of the build quality isn't so good. The paintwork is easily damaged. The electric windows in the front passenger doors don't slide into the seal properly. But what the hell, you get a car that is loaded with goodies, has lots of room and is fast enough.
I bought mine used for approx $9500 (ï¿½6000), 27K miles and only 2 years old. A used BMW 318 would have cost me twice that at least and not had half the fittings in the Hyundai.
Mine is automatic (most cars in the UK are manual shift) and the box is OK but a bit old fashioned compared to other manufacturers. 
It guzzles petrol which is a bit of a let down in this day and age. 
Still, if you fancy something with plenty of goodies for not too much outlay then try one of these. I mean, just buy it and have fun. You can always dump it about 3 years later.
