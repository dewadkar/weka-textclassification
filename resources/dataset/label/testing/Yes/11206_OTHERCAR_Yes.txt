                 I originally bought a minivan only because I coached softball and Special Olympics.  I needed some kind of vehicle to cart around many of kids.  As it turns out, I love my van!  I never thought I would own a minivan, much less love it. 
     The Villager is a very economical vehicle.  It has many features that are considered extras on other vans, such as cd player changer and digital dash board.  I shopped around extensively and found the Villager to be the best value for the money.
     The Villager gets comparable gas mileage to any other vehicle of its size.  The seats are very comfortable and are power in mine.  The back seats are very simple to remove and put back.  It has plenty of room for 7 people and softball equipment.  
     The only problem that I have found is finding parts.  I have a '97.  We had a minor fender bender and have not been able to find a new fender for the '97 anywhere except the dealer.
