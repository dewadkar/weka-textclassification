            This camera belongs to my grandmother who bought it from the Home Shopping network.  She has a regular camera by Minolta that takes nice pictures, and I have a very nice Minolta Maxxum 7000 and a few regular 110 cameras that also take nice pictures.  It isn't as though we needed this additional camera, but since we've gotten it-the others have not been needed yet.  (In my opinion, this camera produces good enough pictures to print up instead of developing film!)

Why she bought it: 
Everybody has a digital camera now, it seems, and what she saw on TV looked like it'd be neat to have.  It looked like it took nice pictures, it could download them to the computer or be viewed on the TV screen so she ordered it. 
 
How we like it and what we like about it:
We love it!  It took some minor tinkering with to figure out how it works, but other than that it's extremely fun to use.  It has a digital display so you can view the pictures without squinting through a view finder, or (in some cases) if you can't see it very well, looking through the view finder works just fine, too.  It has a flash, so it can be used in low light, and of course you can use it without the flash when appropriate.  It picks up colors very well, it also has a Macro and a ZOOM feature allowing you to take close ups.  It has three different quality settings: FULL, regular and ECONOMY.  The Full quality setting takes very nice pictures that do not show any fuzziness or pixellation and can be printed and blown up or shrunken down without losing the general appearance.  It can take about 20 of those on the provided 8 MB card.  The regular quality pictures are almost as good as the full quality ones.  You can take twice as many of them, of course (about 41).  The economy pictures are really good for general pictures rather than ones that need to show detail or will be blown up or printed.  The camera can take about 73 of those on the 8 MB card, but they do get pixellated if you try to do much with them.  

A FEW PROBLEMS WE'VE NOTICED:

The camera comes with MGI photosuite software which we were never able to use for the camera itself.  We can use it for other things, but it could never detect the camera.  We also had Corel photohouse which is what we ended up using with the camera.  It works just fine, and the pictures always turn out nice.  The download is a little slow, and you have to pretty much leave it alone until it's finished or else it may have to start again.  Keeping the camera erased every time you use it again helps alleviate some of these problems.  The directions are very vague, and may be confusing to some people.  I'm used to not reading them and just figuring out how it works by myself, but some people rely on good directions to get them going, and these are just not what I'd call good directions.  The last thing I'd complain about the camera is battery life.  VERY short battery life.  We have not tried it with the E-Titaniums or Duracel ultras (which are supposed to be great in high drain devices), but the regular duracels, energizers, and generics all drain about as fast.  It does come with an ac adapter, which I recommend ALWAYS using it on when downloading photos, or doing anything with it that you do NOT need to move freely around with it.  Using rechargable batteries may also be more economically effective.  

OVERALL:

Overall I think it's a great little camera for the money.  I believe it is a 1.3 (I have been corrected) Mega Pixel camera for those wondering, although I'm not positive on that number.  You CAN buy more memory for it, although it comes with an 8 mb memory card (go up to 128 mb I believe).  Only if you really need it, though.  We have not needed to yet.  I would recommend this camera to most people, and I'm sure glad we have it. 

Note: I am estimating on price paid as I was not the one who bought it.
