            A 1998 Plymouth Breeze is not what you would normally find a newly wed couple with no kids driving. It looks like a car typical of rich seniors, it is sleek, gorgeous and very expensive looking. But for me and my husband it was actually affordable, and it feels like we're driving in luxury. Driving in our Plymouth Breeze has given us confidence and a sense of relief. Even though we bought it used, it came with a 3 year warranty and there have been no signs of us needing it. We put our Plymouth to the test recently by driving it accross country non-stop and it preformed beautifully! The cruise control never acted up, we got great gas mileage, it did not overheat, no engine troubles or noises, just one smooth ride. 
We came across the 1998 Plymouth Breeze while looking for a replacement for our purple and blue spray painted 1987 Buick that was dying rapidly. We were looking for compact cars because that was what seemed affordable to us until we came accross the Breeze and saw that we could afford it. And it was a luxury car. There is no way we need the huge backseat right now but, heck, we hope to have kids some day. :)
On top of the great outside appearance, the inside is just as fancy. The driver and passenger &quot;pilot&quot; seats are extremely comfortable (another thing we tested in our non-stop drive). As if the trunk did not have enough space in it, the back seat folds down too. 
I sincerely do not hate a thing about our car. The car dealership we got it from is another story, but it's not the cars fault. :)

P.S.- If you live in the Ft. Walton Beach area DO NOT buy from LEE Chrysler Plymouth Dodge.<br><br>
