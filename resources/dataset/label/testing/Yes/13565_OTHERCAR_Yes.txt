            My car is a:
2003 Boxster S
Sport seats
Litronic
18" Carerra wheels
Bose sound system
Color keyed seatbelts
Contrast leather stitching
Color keyed center console
CD changer
Colored crests
Manual transmission

My points of reference:
I previously owned a 1997 Mazda Miata and a 2001 BMW M Coupe.  I have also driven a base Boxster on occasions as a loaner.

The handling on this car is superb.  The power is more than enough (though not as much as the BMW M Coupe).  The brakes are excellent.  The pedals are great for heel-toe shifting, and the throttle responsiveness makes it easy.  The seats are far superior to both of the above cars.  I've traveled up to 400 miles at a time without lower back pain.  The build quality has been better than the BMW.  Less squeaks and rattles, less annoying "quirks" and unaddressed issues.

That being said, I can imagine many ways that someone could be disappointed with this car.  This car is not for you if you must have the fastest car around.  This car is not for you if your feelings get hurt when someone calls your car "not a true Porsche."  This car is not for you if you want a good value.  This car is not for you if you expect Lexus amenities for its price.  Its not the fastest car at the stop light.  Its not a 911, the flagship Porsche.  It, like all Porsches, are horrid values.  Everything is an option, down to floormats and stereo.  The downside is that you may feel nickel and dimed on the options list.  The upside is that the options list is so expansive that you can customize the car to your personality, right from the factory.  If you want a performance bargain, buy a Corvette.  If you are insecure about having the lowest model in Porsche's lineup, get a 911 or take your Boxster money over to BMW where you can get in the middle of the line.

You may be happy with this car if you want a viscerally enjoyable driving experience.  The engine, steering, handling, braking, and cabin are excellent.  Only BMW has a similar focus on the driver, and even now BMW has gone avant-garde bonkers.  You may be happy with this car if you want to appreciate it with age.  Look at how olde Porsche designs get better as days pass.  The more I consider this car, the more perfectly balanced and harmonious the design appears to me.  Simply put, drive this car and you'll know whether its for you.

Having experienced the base Boxster, I would not do it.  The engine performance is not up to snuff to open my wallet.  The base radio is tinny.  The Tiptronic transmission never lets you forget that its an automatic at heart.  Its sluggish and saps power.  The base interior is an unbroken swath of hard, severe, black plastic.  For $45k cost of entry on the base model, its one of the worst values ever.  I think the $60+ that one can spend on a Boxster S, nicely equipped, is well spent.
