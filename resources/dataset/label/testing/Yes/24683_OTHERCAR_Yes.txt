              When my husband and I started to look for a new minivan it was a difficult choice. There are many nice vans out there with all sorts of options to chose from.  We decided that a sand color Chevy Venture would be our choice with the lightweight back seats that fold up right behind the middle seats.  Anyone can easily fold them up, even my kids. We also decided on the extended van so we have plenty of room for vacations and camping trips.
  When we first drove the Chevy Venture it impressed us with it's incredibly smooth ride. It is also very quiet inside even at high speeds.
Several seat configurations are possible. We got the middle captain's chairs option.  There are about 17 drink cup holders everywhere.  Some are even square if you are brave enough to let your kids have a juice box or milk in the car. Also there are lots of pockets and storage places throughout the van in all sorts of convenient places.
 I love the sound system it is great and really adds to my pleasure as I am doing errands.  The kids have the back seat headphones to use and listen to what they like also. It helps to keep them busy on long rides.  We opted not to get the video player in the car. There is enough TV that kids watch we didn't feel we wanted that option.
    I will say that it is hard to buckle the seatbelts of kids in the back seats.  And the kids do tend to get the seat belts tangled up in the slide thing.  Also we did have a bit of paint chip off within a week or two of getting the van.  And the back of the front seats are a poor design
and are coming apart within two months of purchase.  We talked to a friend about that who has a Chevy Venture also and he has the same problem and has to keep taking them in to be fixed. We haven't had them fixed yet as our van is only about two months old. But we do love it even with the problems and I would buy it all over again.
