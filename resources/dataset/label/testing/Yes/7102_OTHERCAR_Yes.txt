            I don't know if its just me, but I think both the Beetle and Miata share a similar history.  When the original Beetle came out, it was a very cheap albeit an uncomfortable, tiny vehicle.  It sold a lot because of the low cost factor, and it didn't really offer much.  The new Beetle is hardly the same.  Costing near 20k, it even has a Turbo model with a spoiler!  Its original, cheap basic car image is long gone.

Now take a look at Miata history.  Roadsters were high powered sports cars for the rich and the lucky in the 80's.  At a price lower then 15k, the original Miata was a marketing success.  If was unsafe, small, didn't offer much in terms of performance or handling, but it was a cheap roadster and fun to drive.  After 10 years of its original arrival, we now have a completely new Miata that only shares the looks and the style of the original one.  The new miata costs around 20k in its base model, sporting a slightly better and more fuel efficient engine, and it can be called a medium priced car if you stay away from options such as Air conditioning or Power anything.  Its price can go all the way up to 25k!

Now, I think that is a lot for a toy car -- which is pretty much what roadster means.  Miata is only comfortable enough for 2 average height or below people.  Its trunk space is good for a 2 bags of groceries, but you will probably have to drop the water-melon.  Its a great car for a picnic, or a drive by the beach on sundays.  The classic pop-up headlights are no longer existant on the new models.  Now, they have the more aggressive and sweeter (at least, in my eyes) headlights that give the car a more futuristic look.

My personal experience with a Miata comes from a lady friend who absolutely loves this car.  She has had both a 93 Miata and a 99 Miata.  She won't let me drive the new one, but I had some fun with the early model.  As a matter of fact, the only people that I know who drive Miata's are ladies.  Is this a women's car?  I haven't the slightest clue.  I personally would love to have it as a weekend driver.  Miata punches an eye popping 140HP, which is about a jaw dropping 7hp higher then the earlier models!  (Hint: sarcasm).  I wouldn't consider this a muscle car; its more like a fun to drive, sporty looking weekend vehicle, and I seriously recommend it for that purpose only.<br><br>
