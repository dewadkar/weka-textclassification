            I've had my 2000 Tracker for 1 year. I would recommend this vehicle, however it doesn't handle well in the wind. It handles very good in snow and we get alot of that in WI. The wind noise in minimal and the radio system is good. There is alot of room inside for a compact vehicle. It does have one annoying quirk. When you put it into reverse it clunks! The dealer said that's normal. The color is great(silver) and the quality of the paint and door fittings is good. The overall ride for a vehicle with such a short wheel base is comfortable. There is plenty of head &amp; leg room. I would have like a leather seat option, but that was not available.<br><br>
