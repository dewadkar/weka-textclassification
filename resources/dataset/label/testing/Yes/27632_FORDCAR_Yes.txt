            Its a cool car! If you're turned-off of gas guzzling SUVs with painted bumpers, but needing a gutsy vehicle with height, then this is a super choice!

I liked the truck aspect to the vehicle, it allowed me to drive the country roads where we live. The additional height was also a great safety factor as we daily take the highway amongst large vehicles. In our previous car, a Jetta, we couldn't see squat! We bought this car because unlike most SUVs, its gas consumption is acceptable, plus handling and visibility is excellent. 

The headrest point mentioned by others is valid, but I don't think it will be a problem. For example, our Jetta had this arrangement as well and lasted 6 years. If you're nice to your vehicle, it will be nice as well. The overall layout is great, good use of space without sacrificing comfort.

Having recently bought the Escape, we took it for a weekend retreat. Driving was very stable and response good. I never had a feeling that we were going to tip when taking a corner. The seats worked well, staying in them for 2 hours at a stretch (we had the XLT). I didn't notice any noise problem. We had the high end Mach stereo and had it cranked most of the time. I highly recommend the top-end stereo!!

Its a super car, very stylish, very safe. No regrets on this purchase!<br><br>
