            We bought our Quest GXE a a couple of years back. I never could see my self driving a mini van, but I have to say that I just love my  Quest. The GXE has so many extras it doesn't feel like I am driving a mini van. I love the sporty design of it. We bought this one used and got a really good deal. Nissans a very reliable vehicles and the Quest is no exception they tend to hold their value very well. We have had some problems with the van but those are mostly dealer related. We got this van when we were expecting our 3rd child and we needed a dependable vehicle with plenty of room. It is a great van for traveling, makes a perfect family car!!!!
