            Let me start off by saying that this is the first time I've been an SUV owner.  So far, I've owned three vehicles, all Pontiacs.  Finally after 6 years of college and three years in the workforce, I decided that it was time for me to pay myself back.
I researched SUVs for the past year, and decided it was down to the Isuzu Rodeo or the Escape.  When factoring in gas mileage and a couple other items, the Escape finally won out.  
I've read some other epinions about engine noise when you accelerate.  First of all--I don't hear it.  Secondly, if the noise is so irritating that you find it to be something to recommend people not to buy the vehicle, you're revving the engine WAY too much.  I've found nothing but smooth acceleration and no more noise that the other quiet vehicles out there.  And this is with the V6.
Room.  That's what you'll find with the Escape.  Even though it's one of the smaller type SUV's it still has plenty of space for you and your passengers.  Now remember, I'm used to cars, so this may be more noticeable for me than to others who have owned SUVs in the past.  But I can't get over the amount of space I have up front, and in the back when I fold the passenger seat down to move cargo.
Options.  I didn't get many, but there are tons available.  I'm still having to wait for the day I can get my moonroof.  That's the only thing I have to complain about.  You can't pick your options--you have to take them in groups.  But you have many packages to choose from, so you're sure to find an adequate amount.
Price.  You'll find that this is right in line with the other SUV's of similar size.  And Ford has many payment plans to choose from.  Add in the gas mileage, and this will be a much more economical vehicle than a lot of the other ones out there.  But hey, if you can afford the SUV, you can afford the gas; or at least that's my opinion on the matter.
You won't find much of a difference in the '01 and the '02.  I test drove an '01, but bought the '02 model for just a bit more.  No real difference though.  My insurance only went up $100 every six months (excellent driving record though), and you'll have to find out for yourself about other costs.  But, you can go to any of the numerous car information websites to find out the specs that you can get with this vehicle.
I think you'll love this vehicle.  Unless you're biased against Ford, or want more room and power in an SUV, the Escape is for you.
