            The Chrysler Sebring Coupe is a very comfortable and luxurious car for its price range.  The car is the sister car to the Dodge Avenger.  I have a friend who calls it a baby Lexus.  The car comes in two models - LX and LXi.  The LXi has nicer interior features, and for the price difference, you should just look at this model.  In fact, few lots (at least in Northern California) even stock the LX model.

<b>The Interior</b>
The best thing about this car is the size-it must be the largest coupe in its class.  The back seat is very roomy. I won't buy a car unless I am comfortable in the back sea, and this car's back seat comfortably sits two or even three.  In addition, the trunk is huge, and includes fold-down back seats for long trunk contents.  Beware, however, as the opening into the back seat is relatively narrow; thus, long is OK but long and wide (like the garden trellis I tried to fit) just doesn't work as well.

The heating system works well, though it takes longer for the air to heat up than other cars I have used.  The air conditioning works quite well, even with the sunroof open.

The dashboard is well laid out, with the speedometer easily seen, and enough gauges to be able to figure out what is going in (but few enough to not be cluttered).

<b>Interior Options</b>
The car comes with Leather Seats as an option, but every dealer I have seen includes it as a free add-on in the LXi model.  In addition, a reasonably inexpensive package that I got is the sunroof and 6 speaker Infinity CD player.  The sun and sound was worth every penny (it cost me about $10 a month on the lease), especially on road trips.

The truth of the matter is that so few of these cars are sold that most car lots only have models with these options.

<b>The Exterior</b>
On the plus side as well is the distinctive look.  This car is a good looking car and few people drive it, so it usually gets a second look.  Some have compared the looks to one of the new Jaguar's.  The wheel size has a large diameter with 17&quot; cast aluminum mag wheels that are the same color as the rest of the car, and the back end is raised higher than the front to give it more of a race car type of look.

One problem with the exterior is that the front is low, and sometimes scrapes a high curb.  To fix this, they include a plastic protector on the front. The problem is that the protector easily pulls off, and then scrapes down the road.  This happened to me twice, and the second time, it actually tore some of the underside of the body's plastic.  A real problem, but not one to keep you from buying the car.

<b>Gas Mileage</b>
The engine sucks gas (20 or less MPG in the city).  This is a bad feature of the car in my opinion, especially given the performance, as described below.  

<b>Engine Power</b>
The engine is a V6 2.5L Single Overhead Cam (163 Horsepower). The car does great in the mountains (if you turn overdrive off), but it lacks much pickup (making me wonder where all that gas goes).  Don't get this car if you want a weave in and out of traffic and blow all cars off the line.  While turning overdrive off will work better, it just doesn't have the umph of other cars with similar engines, perhaps because of its larger size.

<b>The Ride</b>
The Sebring Coupe uses the same wishbone suspension as the Mitsubishi Eclipse, and it is quite good.  The ride is extraordinarily smooth, and one of the car's nicest features.

<b>Other features</b>
Other features (all on the LXi model) include the following: cruise control, auto-keyless entry and alarm, wood grain dash, garage door opener (not just a spot for it, but an actual learning opener),rearview mirror with compass and automatic headlight dimming, great interior lights that focus right on your lap, and a 6 way adjustable driver seat.

One of the kludgy interior features is that there is a CD player but no real place to put your CD's.  The center armrest is too small to hold a CD case, as are the door side pockets.  The glove compartment barely holds a couple CD cases, and does not hold a travel case.   This was a real design oversight.

<b>The Cost</b>
I leased my Sebring Coupe about 8 months ago.  $324 a month after tax with $1600 down.  It retails for about $22,000.  I think it was worth the price.

This is a rewrite of my original Sebring Coupe epinion.  I am ashamed of the poor quality of the first one (which is now deleted).  <br><br>
