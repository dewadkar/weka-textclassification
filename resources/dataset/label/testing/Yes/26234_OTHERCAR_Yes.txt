            If you are looking for a sport utility that drives like a sports car, the BMW X5 is the vehicle for you.  The BMW X5 is the second fastest sport utility on the market today, which makes it more fun to drive than most truck-like SUVs. Only the Mercedes-Benz ML55 AMG boasts faster 0-60 and 3/4 mile times.  The BMW X5 is roomy and can be stuffed with all the gadgets of the modern luxury sport utility vehicle, including Napa leather seating surfaces, navigation system, heated seats, xenon headlights, rain-sensing wipers, and HK sound system.  Cargo space is the smallest in its class, but as BMW says, this is a Sport Activity Vehicle not Sport Utility Vehicle.  BMW offers two X5 models to choose from, the X5 3.0 being powered by the new for 2001 in line 6 that powers the 3 and 5 series as well.  With only 225 horsepower, this base model may be underpowered for many BMW enthusiasts considering the X5's hefty curb weight.  However, the X5 4.4i solves that problem with its 282 hp V8.  Driving this X5 is like driving a 540i with improved visibility.  Although quick, its no M5 due to its hefty mass.  The X5 with the optional sport package handles like a true BMW with tight and accurate steering feedback, a firm but not extremely harsh ride, and excellent overall ride quality.  The X5 is an excellent on-road performer, but it may not handle as well off road due to its sporting nature and low profile rubber.  However, the X5 is an excellent all around vehicle, since most SUVs will never see off road conditions and BMW's stability control provides adequate control and traction in the snow (mine was tested several times last winter).  The BMW X5 should be on the test drive list of anyone in the market for a $50,000+ SUV.
