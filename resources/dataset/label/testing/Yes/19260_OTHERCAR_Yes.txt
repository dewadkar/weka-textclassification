            We bought this truck in January of 2000 from a clearance sale of all the dealerships 1999 models.  What attracted me to the truck was, at first, its attractiveness.  Ours is somewhat of a red and black theme.  Red being the main color with black guards, bug deflector, bed liner, everything.

Simply put, beyond the great looks of it, the truck itself is awesome.  For the size, it has a very powerful pickup on the engine.  Ours has a V8 in it, and even with that we can get around 25 miles to the gallon in the city.  We have yet to take it out on open highways to test the gas mileage there.

It has excellent suspension, you almost never feel anything, and the steering is very good as well.  It has no play in the wheel, and the wheel rotation is tight, so you'll have no problem with oversteering.

The 4wd is very easy to operate.  Most users of 4wd will note that the low to high shifting on 4wd units is somewhat difficult to engage and disengage.  But this truck feels as easy as driving a manual transmission.  Almost no effort is need to adjust the 4wd power.

This is just an all around awesome truck.<br><br>
