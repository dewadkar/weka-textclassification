            This camera is the one of the neatest contraptions to hit the market ina  long time!  Its great for the people who like to take pictures with friends and dont like to wait for the film to get developed or downloaded to your PC.  The unique polaroid feature allows for a great digital picture, printed at the push of a button, without any downloading.  Plus it has 2.1 million pixel resolution allowing for a good shot without a lot of fuzziness.  It has only a two times optical, three times digital zoom, but its is still good for taking fun shots with teh friends.  Although it is rather large it still has the convenience of downloaing to your pc, running on a smart media disk.  This is a great camera for the gadget lover and a teenager!<br><br>
