               This is a great car for a number of reasons.  The styling is great, hip yet mature.  VW has wisely kept to conservative yet handsome styling whereas half the other american or Japanese cars have OVER styled their cars to the point of being ugly.  Not so with the Jetta-it's front end seems to say-&quot;yeah I know I'm way better engineered than all you other guys but don't need the crazy looks to prove it.&quot; I like the head on view of the Jetta, it has a fun but serious look.  I like the interior as well, it seems to be perfectly made, has a very high quality feel.  Also the blue and red lights never make for a boring night drive.  My friends sometimes complain about the back seat, but only when I ask-&quot;hey how is it back there?  The trunk is more room than I'll ever need.  Another place where this car proves itself is on the road, it definitley has that high speed feel, f you're not paying attention you can find yourself doing 90 without noticing, it seems to be dying to reach the speed you have to fight it to keep it slower.  I took it on a drive up through central California where the roads are glassy-smooth and was very impressed at the smoothness, put both hands on the wheel and you feel totally in control, especially fun on slight curves, this is definitley a German engineered car.  Everything feels in perfect balance, you almost become connected to the car, the way it handles feels and the way the seats hold you in a perfect driving position.  The stereo pumps out both my rap and my heavy rock music with ease, and VERY impressed with bass response and just plain rocking the cabin.  I always look forward to any time I have to drive somewhere on the freeway.  I've had sometimes people tell me this car is for girls but I like it for it's German engineering.  I drove a Honda Civic and a Corolla as well as this one and noticed a HUGE, I mean a HHUUUGGE difference, the Jetta felt far superior in every area plus had way more personality as VWs always have.  I can put both my Marshall 100W combo amp and 112 Fender cabinet(standing up!) and my guitar in hard case in the trunk and still have room for more-trunk space is unreal!  It will defintitley handle grocery trips with ease as well as just keeping your junk back there.  Plus I'm 6'1&quot; tall and find the back seat adequate.  I'm single still and am not really interested in dating so this car suits me fine, maybe when I start dating this car will do well in that area too!  Thanks for reading my review, hopefully it will encourage you to make a wise descision and buy this car.  <br><br>
