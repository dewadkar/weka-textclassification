            I received the Ford stationwagon in the fall semester of my junior year. Before this momentous ocassion, it had been under the care of my sister and it bore well worn signs of use indeed. My first impression was &quot; Yes! A car at last!&quot; 
 Indeed, the Escort Stationwagon is dependable and a sturdy partner. I drive a 93' Escort and i receive 225 miles on  a full tank. The engine is yet to seize or give up on me, touchwood. Of course on the Turnpike, i am accustomed to the sight of cars rushing past me at the speed of what looks like light to me, whereas in reality they are pushing a cool 80. 55-60 miles per hour is a reasonable expectation for my Escort, although you can definitely hit 90 or more on the newer models without breaking a sweat. As a racing model, the Escort won't sate your desires. If your passion for speed reigns supreme, i would advise you to stick with the Nissan, Saturn or Pontiac.
  Dependability and cargo room is what i love about my Escort. When i spy my black stationwagon parked among a shiny Z3, a Lexus, a Benz, or a Infiniti, i think &quot; My dear dependable comrade. Here you are.&quot;
   Basically, if you're looking for economical prices, reliability and a vehicle to get around with, this Ford's for you, baby.<br><br>
