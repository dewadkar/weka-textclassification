            The 1995 Honda Prelude Si has been an excellent car.  The Si version (there is also an S version (135 hp) and VTEC version (190 hp)) has a 160 hp engine that sounds and feels like more.  The car accelerates rapidly (expect about an 8 second 0-60 with an automatic transmission) well into the low 100's.  And it handles incredibly well.  People who drive my car for the first time always comment on how well the car corners.  A few times I've had to push the handling of the car to the limit and it has always remained composed and controllable.  It's truly a driver's car.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable with a wrap-around design that keeps you in place and the controls are all located with consideration going towards the driver.  The only problem with the seats is getting into them.  This car sits low, so getting in and out is a task.

While this car seems oriented just for play, it's been a great car for driving long distances.  Once I drove from Missouri to South Padre Island (with only gas and food stops) and I was comfortable (aside from the sleep deprivation) the whole time.

The Prelude has been very reliable, I've yet to have a problem, and is very fuel efficient when travelling (I've driven five and a half hours without needing to refuel).  Around town, however, the car does tend to suck up a lot more gas than would be thought.  And like most cars of this type, the rear seat is meant for coats, not people.

If you want a car of this type, this is the one to get.
