            I purchased a 1999 Jeep Wrangler on a whim.  I already had a '95 Jeep Cherokee which I enjoyed using and I like to head to the woods as an outlet when I need a break.  I bought a 6 cylinder automatic with power steering and air conditioning.  I was told that the 6 cylinder is better for an automatic transmission.  I never expected to enjoy the car as much as I have.

A lot has been said about the Jeep Wrangler being topheavy but the company must have fixed the problem when they reworked the model in '97 because I have never had a problem with this.  The Wrangler has a wide wheel base which corners well and doesn't cause leaning.  It handles mountain roads very well.  The 6 cylinder pick-up also helps in the handling.

Because the Wrangler is a convertible top car, the ride is noisier than the Cherokee.  I have had several convertibles and expected this but with the plastic windows, there is even more noise.  The stereo may have to blast to be heard well at high speeds.  Also, the plastic windows are easily scratched.  It is suggested that soft cotton be used to clean them.

The car is very comfortable to drive and ride in but I would not recommend it for long trips.  I have found that the gas mileage is pretty good for a 4 wheel drive automatic.  But it is not cheap.<br><br>
