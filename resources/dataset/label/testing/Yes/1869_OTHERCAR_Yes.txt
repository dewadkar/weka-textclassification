            I have owned my 1992 Pontiac Grand Am since 1997 and cannot say that I haven't had my share of problems.  When you buy a used car you know that you are buying someone else's problems.  You just hope that the car doesn't have many expensive problems.  In the beginning the car caused me somewhat of a headache.  The struts went, numerous battery troubles, engine work, the rear view mirror fell off and some other problems.  I have written an epinion before on my Grand Am not recommending it but I've decided to change my mind.

Most cars, especially American cars, are said to break down after 75,000 miles.  Everything goes wrong.  For some reason, I've had the opposite happen to me.  My car has been extremely dependable in its old age.  The only maintenance I've needed in the past couple of years is oil changes!  Consumer Reports rated the 1992 Pontiac Grand Am to be one of the worst running cars after it hits 75,000.  My car is approaching 77,000 soon and it has become more reliable than my friends 1997 Mitsubishi Galant.  

I guess not all American cars are bad.

Lastly, here are some of the features of this particular model, good and bad:

THE GOOD

1.  It's roomy for a more sporty car.  The 2 door actually has more leg room in the back than the 1992 Acura Integra 4 door.
2.  When you approach the ramp for a highway, there is no need to floor it.  This car has balls! It speeds up extremely fast.
3.  Big trunk and a lot of consoles except the cup holders aren't that good.
4.  No blind spots.
5.  Fog lamps are a huge plus!
6.  Factory radio was decent but I added a CD player instead.
7.  ABS brakes.  A must!

THE BAD

1.  Gas guzzler.
2.  The dummy lights are always on!  I guess that's where the name derived from.
3.  The car rattles a lot from the dash.  It's definitely not a quiet car.
4.  Manual roll up windows.
