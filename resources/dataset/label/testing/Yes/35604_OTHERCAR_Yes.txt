            I bought my Malibu LS after hours of research.  I had had my heart set on a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.  While reviewing Consumer Reports I stumbled upon the Malibu.  It had a pretty good write up so off I went to take a look.

I was very surprised at the price of the car considering that just about all the &quot;options&quot; were standard.  I bought my car, fully loaded, for about $18,500.  It has a moonroof, air, abs, cd/stereo, mudflaps, and rides like a dream.  I was also excited about the left handed cup holder, being a lefty living in a right-handed world. The trunk is very spacious and the back seat is roomy enough for adults to sit comfortably.

I would recommend this car to anyone that wants a roomy sedan without the high price tag.

This is definately that car you knew American could build!<br><br>
