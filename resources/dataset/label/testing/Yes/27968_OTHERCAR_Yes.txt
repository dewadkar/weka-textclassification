            My particular Tacoma is a 2 wheel drive Extra cab 2000 model.  I purchased this for my long commute to work (62 miles each way) and to accommodate my family of four and still not have to sacrifice not having a truck.

The pros of the this vehicle defiantly out weights the cons.  This is a great truck for long commutes.  Toyota has really raised their standards in regards to comfort.  It's comfort level and ride is right up their with a nice family sedan.  The wore out feeling that you get after long rides are minimal and gas mileage is good (25 MPG around town and very close to 30 MPG on the highway).  If it had lumbar support then it would be exceptional for the long haul.  I have two child seats in the back of my extra cab and they fit very well but it wouldn't hurt if Toyota could figure out how to add a few more inches of foot room.  My truck is loaded so I can comment on options.  They are great.  I have the CD/Tape stereo and is very user friendly and it sounds great.  The power options and cruise are great.  I couldn't think of a way to improve on these.  A positive note about the cruise is that it holds its set speed extremely well.  It takes a good hill to make it back off while cruising in top gear(manual 5th for me).  For those that are more concerned about short commutes and back road handling there are good comments on this too.  It handles great on back roads, just don't get too fast because the back end might hop, but this is only at excessive speeds.  On the note of excessive speeds, it has plenty of power (150 hp) for those times that grandma is going to the grocery store and you are late for work.  Just gear down and you will be impressed that this is a fuel efficient truck. 

This truck in my opinion is for those who want a reliable, comfortable, fuel economic, compact size truck.  If you need the extra cab, even with my request for more room it is still one of the most spacious extra cabs in the compact pickup market and it accommodate child seats better than it's competitors.   This vehicle is not for people needing full size trucks room, and power.
