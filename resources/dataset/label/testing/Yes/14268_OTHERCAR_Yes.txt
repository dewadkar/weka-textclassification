            Well, Mazda nearly got it right in the end - the 1993-1995 Rx-7s were finally what every Rx-7 enthusiast had been screaming for for the previous  14 years - twin turbo rotary with a racing suspension.  This car is attractive, fast, and there are plenty of high-performance goodies available.  The trouble was the price had tripled since debuting in 1979, out of reach for most of the previous two generations' loyal following.  What? You want all the options for free too?   

Since I haven't driven one of the third generation Rx-7s I'll leave that to other aficionados.  I have, however, logged some 60,000 miles with the first (79-85) and second generation (86-91) Rotary Rockets.  

Our saga begins in the summer of 1987, when Dad went to the Mazda dealer to get the new 87 Rx-7 (Sport Package), the 1979 Rx-7 which he had also bought new became my first car.  I had learned to drive the car at 17 and now I officially took possession.  The car was everything a young college student needed - fast, sexy, and a 2-seater (no ride-alongs when you're out on a date).  About a year into the love affair with the perfect car, everything was going great until a fateful road trip which left the Rotary limping along in a rain storm.  The diagnosis at the local garage had revealed the sobering reality - not a carburetor problem, no...I'm afraid the compression check had unveiled the worst of all possible scenarios - the rear rotor had failed, rendering the motor (and the car) useless.  

After a month in the shop and a new factory motor from the Mazda dealer, replaced only after 76,000 miles on the odometer (only 1000 past the engine warranty, of course), I drove out of the garage with my psyche and identity restored with new found freedom to explore the road once more.  I was feeling a bit of trepidation having been bitten so early, I wondered, listened at every bump, squeak, or hesitation - It would take me some months for my complete confidence to be restored in my little silver friend.  

Flash forward several years (and autocrosses) later.  The Mazda had been updated with the latest trick gear from the best manufacturers as I completely lost control after receiving my first real paycheck from my first real job.  BFG Comp TA ZRs, Tokico shocks and struts, lowering springs, leather drivers seat, newly rebuilt transmission (which I actually took the time to do myself), as well as a K &amp; N filter charger and a Holley carb.  This baby cooked and looked.  

To once again make a short story long (I becoming known for that), I blew another motor on the way back from grad school one weekend.  Once again, I could feel the knot welling up inside when the engine began to sputter up the 10-mile ascent to the top of the mountain.  I nearly reached the top before the engine died completely and refused to start again, despite my most vociferous opposition.  Coasting up the hill to a clearing on the side of the road I waited in agony for 3 hours for a tow truck (this was before prominent cell phone abuse on the nations roadways - waving hand signals to the slowly passing 18-wheelers was all I had to work with).

Well, I decided that it was probably not sensible to put a third engine in a car with just over 120K miles that was worth only a couple of grand at the time.  It sat and I am happy to report, (much to the dismay of my very understanding wife) that it still sits in my possession.  

What's a Rotary fanatic to do?  Buy another one, right?  Well, no, but I actually inherited the 87 from my brother (who got it when Dad bought another new Rx-7 in 1991).  They had always served him well, but guess what�s wrong with the 87?  Yep, you guessed it - the motor.  Mind you, the cars were always alright until we got a hold of them :)

Now I've got two sitting in storage (a '79 and '87) - both with bad motors!  In spite of the experience I have had, there's one person I've talked to in the local SCCA club who has over 200K miles on his first generation Rx-7 and he still autocrosses it occasionally and drives it daily.  Roll the dice, I guess.

The trick with the second generation Rotaries is you that can't drive them short distances.  Starting the car and moving around the parking lot and shutting it off will kill a rotary faster than you can say &quot;ceramic apex seals&quot;.  That, in fact was the nemesis of the otherwise ingenious and efficient Rotary design.  In the latter years, the horsepower was nearly 220/liter - an outstandingly efficient engine.  And in a lightweight, neutral handling package, it seemed the perfect drivers car.

Well, to wrap this novel up let me just say that I�ll not ever forget the experience of driving the Rx-7 when it was on top of it�s game (OK, really it was great just when it was running at all).  For those owners who have been lucky enough to end up with a reliable Rotary in their dream machine, the distinguishing baritone exhaust note and high-revving motor have brought many to know the epitome of true motoring ecstasy.  Those that have had the unfortunate experience of sitting in a tow truck for several hours with your pride and joy on the back know the other half of the beast - all too well, I�m afraid.  It�s the ultimate love-hate relationship.
