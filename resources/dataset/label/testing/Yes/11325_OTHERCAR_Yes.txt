            Why did I buy it?  Well, my husband is English.  That says a lot in itself, but 2 years before we had traded in our '88 XJS on a Lexus SC400.  After the Jag, we felt so 'common' in the Lexus.  It just didn't have that Jag sex appeal - that noticeability.  When the new XK8 came out we ordered one immediately.
What do I love?  What's not to love?  It's beautiful!  There has not been a time in 3+ years that I have been told what a great car it is.  People stop me in parking lots, wave when I drive by shouting &quot;Nice Car&quot;, and I never can wipe that smile off my face.  It's fun, classy, elegant, and sporty all in one.
Driving it is a dream.  I feel like it is part of me.  It really hugs the road, the seats really hug the driver, has great pick up at low and high end.  It is not too small, the back seat is not great for people, but is a good place to carry things a 2 seater can't handle.  The trunk is very spacious.  It is very heavy and feels very secure.  We actually went to the Jaguar plant in Coventry, England to watch the assembly line with an invitation from Jaguar.  It was great watching the cars be assembled for different countries, with steering wheels on whatever side!  The wood grain on the dash board is so carefully put together.
I haven't driven it in the winter except this year.  It does not handle AT ALL in snow.  The rear wheel drive and wide tires have it all over the road.  I only have 16K miles on it, so I will store it very soon.  I don't want to get any dings on it!  Also, My car is white, which makes it hard to see in the snow.  Another problem is every year when we store it for the winter the battery goes dead.  It is not easy to remove the battery and when it dies, all the electronics get screwed up.  Other than that, there have been no problems mechanically to date.  I guess the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (Lucas Electronics) have been removed.
Anyone who wants a convertible and has the money for a Jag should buy this car.  Especially if you live in a warm climate and can get a full year's use out of it.<br><br>
