            We have now had our ML for 2 years.  We still love it very much.  We have had one problem with it so far.  The driver side window switch basically stopped working.  We went in to get it repaired and found out that it was a common problem with the ML's.  So big a problem in fact, that the part would be back ordered for a month.  Being that I live in a condo and park in a parking garage at work, I had to open my door for that month when leaving and arriving at each garage.  That was a pain.
We also had another minor problem.  The trim around the back of our handle of the rear hatch has cracked.  I was quoted $75.00 to replace it.  Not sure when it broke, but we will leave it as is for a while more.

The ride is very smooth for an SUV although not as smooth as the Lexus RX300, which I test drove.  The ML corners smoothly and has a smooth, powerful engine.  Wind and road noise is kept to a minimum.  It is very comfortable to drive long distances.

The steering response is slow at slower speeds.  You have to really turn the wheel a lot especially in parking garages.  Otherwise, it isn't an issue at highway speeds. 

It is able to make tight turns.  It makes taking U-turns very easy.  

The windows and sunroof mechanism is very slow.  Got used to it now, but it was irritatingly slow in the beginning.  

The seats are quite comfortable, but it seems that you just sit on top of them, where as other seats seem to conform to you and hold you.  Also, the interior, we feel, is very beautiful.

One thing that makes up for its shortcomings is the fact that it is a Mercedes.  At first, I was embarrassed to be driving a Mercedes, but I have become quite proud to be able to drive it.  

Being that is is an SUV, the vehicle is very versatile.  I have used it to take my wife to a fine dining restaurant and also to help my friends move apartments.  I even throw my surfboard in the back and take it down to the beach.    
I have only received compliments about how comfortable the rear seats are, even when I have carried 3 people in the back.  We passed on the third row seat option, because they seem more trouble than they were worth.  The number one reason being that when they are stowed, they take up quite a bit of cargo space.
 When purchasing a vehicle, one must also consider the service that the dealer will give.  The ML's servicing is covered for the first 4 years.  Also, we have been treated with nothing but respect from day 1.  We would, without hesitation, recommend the ML series to anyone.
