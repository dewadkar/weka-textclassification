            I bought this camera during a sale in Summer, 1999.  Since I got mine, 2 of my friends have bought the same camera.  For the price it has features found on cameras that are hundreds of dollars more expensive.  I love the feel of the camera as it feels like a 35 mm camera.  The photos are great and the smart media cards are relatively inexpensive.  I particularly like the fact that there is a battery charging system complete with the camera and feel that I have saved a good bit of money in the last year on NOT buying disposable batteries.  This camera also has a manual mode so that you get more flexibility when shooting photos.  I usually use the automatic mode but if I wanted to get more artistic I have that ability.  Also like the fact that there are different levels of photo quality.  If I am only shooting photos that will be used on the internet I don't have to set the camera on the finest quality setting.<br><br>
