            This is an excellent camera.  I could go on forever listing it's great options, but I'll stick to just a few.  The zoom is fantastic (digital zooms just don't hold a candle to it's optical zoom).  For the amatuer or semi-pro the many program options will come in handy.  You can let the camera pick your aperture and shutter speed, you can utilize it's Aperture priority or Shutter Priority modes, or you just just go manual to control them both.  Manual mode does have the draw back of not being able to manually control the exposure compensation setting.

It also has a special program mode which can really help the amatuer.  A portrait mode to throw the background out of focus, a landscape mode to utilize a nice hyperfocal distance, sports mode to freeze the action (when that's the look you are going for in motion shooting), and a absolutely wonderful night or low light shooting mode that can almost turn the night into day without using the flash (a steady hand or even better a tripod is a must for sharp focus in this mode).  The quicktime movie function is a nice little addition, but the sound is very poor and you need a big memory card to make the option worth using.

I would've like to have seen wider range of apertures (f-stops) in the camera, but there is a good range of shutter speeds.  The pixels are very high and make for clear pictures, and you have the option to select file formats and pixel sizes to optimize the amount of space available on the memory cards.  The USB connection to the PC is a big plus, and the camedia software is good, but if you want to do and major changes to pictures additional software is recommended.  I would really suggest a larger memory card and a second set of rechargeable batteries (the camera comes with one set) because this camera can be a battery hog, especially if you use the large screen much more than the viewfinder (although all camera functions can be viewed through the view finder).
