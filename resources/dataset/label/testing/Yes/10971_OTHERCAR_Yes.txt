            A Suburban is spacious, quiet, and powerful.  It handles much better than its size would suggest.  

The windows are big.    

The seats are comfortable, esp. for long drives.  I would suggest getting a 4WD version to have the piece of mind for bad weather.  

You feel comfortable knowing that having such a large vehicle means that you are going to be safer in any kind of car accident.  It has a much better view of the road than most other vehicles, including minivans.  (My uncle has a Dodge Grand Caravan.)  

If you are considering a used Suburban, then make sure you have one after they put in the Vortec engine, because it has a much better power delivery than previous version of the Suburban.  

If you are thinking about a new Suburban, the 2000 model is 23% stiffer than the old generation (which is what I have).  The 2000 model also has much better and bigger brakes.  Those are among the most significant changes.

The Suburban has a large gas tank and doesn't get good gas mileage.  But it's not supposed to be a Geo Metro.  It is a pleasure to take trips in as a family.  Personally, I prefer it to a minivan on long trips because it has more power and has a smoother ride.  It's heavier, feels safer and has better visibility.

Overall, the Suburban, is without a doubt, the most refined large Sport Utility Vehicle.  It is a pleasure to drive and to take people around in. 

I'd recommend, if you get one, to install an overhead LCD screen so the people in back can enjoy a VCR or video games.  Also, if you are into modifying the engine, there are several kits that boost the power of the Suburban substantially.  If I were to get one, I'd get the Whipple supercharger, which would boost the power by about 50% and costs about $3,000.
