            Back in January of 1995, my husband and I anticipated purchasing a sport utility vehicle.  I can guarantee you I drove every comparable vehicle on the market.  Once I drove a Toyota 4Runner, I went no further.  Not only did it ride like a horse, (yes, I'm from Texas), but the sound system was unsurpassed.  It had both a CD player and a tape player with AM/FM radio.

It is now almost the year 2000, and I still love my 4Runner.  It has 127,000 miles on it, but you would never know it, because it runs like a dream.  I have never had a problem with it in all 127,000 miles, and if buying a sport utility vehicle again, it would undoubtedly be a Toyota.

You can't speed in them, because it isn't a sports car, but the entire machine, from side mirrors to tires, is an outstanding piece of work!  In fact, when my daughter wanted to buy a car, she also bought a Toyota.  

I honestly think from now on, whether luxury sedan or SUV, Toyota rules.  I will never purchase another vehicle.  Well, maybe a Jaguar.........but when it comes to SUVs..........4Runner is IT!
