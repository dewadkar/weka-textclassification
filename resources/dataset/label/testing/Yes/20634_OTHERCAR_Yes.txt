              I bought my first Audi, an A6 2.7T, within the last three weeks (today is April 13, 2000) and I must say I am very happy. (For more details about the buying experience, what cars I compared against the Audi, pricing and availability experience, options I wish I had gotten and more, please read my epinion &lt; <a href='/auto-review-7110-A29F955-38F60E07-prod6'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-7110-A29F955-38F60E07-prod6</a> &gt; Shopping for &amp; buying my new Audi A6 and for my updated epinion after driving the car for 4+ months including some minor foibles, see &lt; <a href='/auto-review-6367-293124C9-3994640E-prod5'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-6367-293124C9-3994640E-prod5</a> &gt; Owner feedback update)
  This car is even better than I imagined it would be. One test drive didn't convey the total enjoyment I've derived from driving this car and learning about all of its features during the last few weeks.
  Following are some initial, first few week impressions, in no particular order.....
  First of all: Driving. A joy. The car feels, to me, like a sports car. It is that quick and agile. Acceleration is real sharp and I can easily get that pleasant, &quot;pushed back into my seat&quot; feeling at any speed. I find the car very response to even a light push on the throttle. Also, handling is firm and confident without feeling skittish, high-strung or nervous. This car feels like it is very firmly attached to the road at any speed. There's no waver, no bounce, no nervous twitches and no feeling that at 70 mph the car is headed for the ditch after a moderate bump or frost heave. I have not had the opportunity to take the car up into the Colorado mountains yet or try high-speed tracking up winding Deer Creek Canyon but with better weather approaching in Colorado I will be soon.
  Second: Automatic (Triptronic) 5sp Transmission.  The very best thing I can say about it... I never notice it!! I never feel the car shifting. This is without a doubt the smoothest shifting car I've ever driven. But don't misunderstand, it is still very responsive. The auto responds immediately to any need to downshift. It is just quiet, unobtrusive, responsive and efficient transfer of power. I couldn't ask for more from this auto transmission.
  Third: Read the owners manual thoroughly. There are a lot more nifty features on this car than I ever learned from the brochure, four dealers, the Audi USA web site and several online auto sites including Edmunds, carsdirect, etc. I'm a tech-geek and maybe I'm more impressed with gadgets than other folks but this car reeks with ergonomics suited to how people really drive. I've never seen this kind of attention to how real people use their car, what they want it to do and how they want to personalize it from any domestic (US) model. It's not that the car has dozens of confusing useless bells and whistles just so it can display a long list of features. The stuff that's on the car all seems appropriate, functional and designed to improve your driving experience and day-to-day satisfaction with the A6 under various driving conditions. There are lots of examples... climate control, rear heated seats that are active only when someone sits there, a trunk area that isn't just an empty space in the car body (Audi engineers actually spent some time and money back here... an area that 90% of auto shoppers never look at until they've already purchased the vehicle.) a great sound system, a trip computer and system monitor that checks everything and has some intelligence built into it. 
  Four:  Interior. I have the Ambiente interior with Melange leather and really enjoy it. I know this is a personal taste area but when I first viewed the A6's interior, I was immediately attracted to it. Driving this car at night with the red glow around the stereo controls &amp; climate control is just.... cool. The wood feature, polished aluminum and soft leather seats are just so right, so hedonistic I sometimes giggle over it as when indulging myself in some luxury like triple scoop Liks ice cream with hot fudge. Only this indulgence isn't fattening or loaded with cholesterol and guilt. It is so comfortable, my significant other doesn't want me or anyone to so much as touch the passenger side front seat adjustments. 

  Options on my car: 
- cold weather package (includes heated front/rear seats, heated steering wheel, others). Recommended. (Virtually impossible to find a car in Colorado without this option.) I didn't think I wanted this but now that it's mine and I've used it, I'm real glad it's there.
- Xenon headlights. You might wonder why these are an additional $500. It's more than just a new bulb filament. These are bright and furthermore include a dynamic headlight control that adjusts the angle of the lamps depending upon vehicle load, acceleration &amp; braking to ensure that the beams are not blinding to other drivers. Recommended
- Bose sound system upgrade.  To my understanding, this is an upgrade only to the speakers in the car. Let me tell you, it's worth it. From a hefty subwoofer mounted in a sidewall in the trunk area to marvelous, tiny &amp; unobtrusive mini-speakers in the door panels this system delivers. I did not get the CD changer. I don't miss it and can add an aftermarket unit later for less money if I think I need one someday.
- convenience package. Get it. Comes with too many things to leave off the car.
- leather seats. Up to you. I really like mine.

  Options I kind-of wish I had picked up:
- warm weather package. Includes the rear sun shade and solar cells in the sunroof to power the ventilation system when the car's interior gets hot on a bright summer day. I wanted this option, still do, but just couldn't find it around here in Colorado. Perhaps because I was looking in March and availability of this option is seasonal.

Summary ----
  I enjoy this car more after using it for almost three weeks. It was a lot of money, for me, about $42500 after $1900 off MSRP, but my enthusiasm for this vehicle has only gotten better.<br><br>
