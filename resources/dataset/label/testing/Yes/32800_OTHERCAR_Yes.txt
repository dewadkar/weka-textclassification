            I've always wanted an SUV. Not for the status or yuppie factor, but because I always wanted a truck. Pickup trucks are not exactly practical, so when SUVs became popular, and more models became available, I decided to trade in my Honda Civic and upgrade to an SUV. 

Before buying my car, I did a lot of research. I checked out Consumer Reports, Edmunds.com, Kelley Blue Book, and other research and review sites and guides. I finally narrowed it down to two SUVs: The Nissan Pathfinder, and the Toyota 4Runner. I decided to check out the Pathfinder first since Nissan was offering special financing rates. I loved it so much, I had to buy it without even testing out the 4Runner! 

I've had my 2002 Pathfinder for about 2 months now, giving me time to find out what I love, like, dislike and hate about it. 


<b>The Specs</b>

I purchased the 2002 Nissan Pathfinder LE, 2 wheel drive. I don't do any type of off-roading, so I didn't feel that 4WD would be necessary. 

The 2002 Nissan Pathfinder comes equipped with a powerful 240 horsepower, V6 engine. Going from a 108 horsepower Civic, this was a major upgrade for me. The car is very powerful and you can feel the power as soon as you touch the accelerator. Going uphill is very easy and you don't hear the engine straining and screeching. The LE comes with 4 speed automatic transmission, although manual transmission is available on the SE trim model. If you want truck like handling, you won't find it here. The Pathfinder handles like a car, which means a smoother ride than other SUVs.

The Pathfinder comes with rear wheel drive. RWD gives me a better feeling of control of my vehicle.

One thing I loved about the Pathfinder while I was doing my research was that it came with 4 wheel ABS (anti-lock brakes) system. ABS is great because it prevents the car form skidding if you brake quickly. Instead, it quickly "pulses", slowing or stopping the car without skidding. That was important to me because sometimes when you have to react quickly, you may not remember that you should pump the brakes instead of pressing down firmly. With ABS, you just press the brake pedal, and it will pump the brakes for you.

Gas mileage is just ok. I average about 16-20 miles per gallon, depending on if I'm driving on surface streets or the freeway. I've been told this is average for SUVs, but going from my 30 mpg Civic, it's a hard transition. I'm not used to going to the gas station every week!


<b>The Exterior</b>

The 2002 Pathfinder is definitely a great looking SUV. It's not too rugged looking, like the Xterra, nor is it too "feminine", like the Lexus RX300. I wanted something that was a perfect blend of the two, and I feel the Pathfinder is a great match.

I liked that it has body colored side molding -- not some cheesy black matte plastic. This gives it a sleeker look. Since I purchased the LE model, I also got 17 inch rims, not the standard 16 inch rims that come with the lower SE model. It also comes with privacy tinted glass on the rear doors and the cargo door. It's not too dark but dark enough to keep the glare from the sun away from people in the back seat. (Front window tinting is illegal in California)

The headlights are bright, and can be set to be manually turned on/off, set on daytime running, or set on dusk sensing, which is what I use. Anytime the vehicle is in a darker area, the headlights automatically come on. Front fog lights are also standard on the LE.

A power sunroof and roof rack are also included on the LE. The sunroof is easy to operate and has two controls: one to slide it open fully, and the other to vent the back portion about an inch or so. The sunroof is glass, but has the sliding panel so you can block out the sun when it is overhead. The rear cargo door also comes with a rear wiper, although I haven't had a chance to use it yet (it hardly rains out here!) The spare tire is mounted underneath the vehicle body towards the rear.


<b>The Seating</b>

I added the leather package to my car for an additional charge. The leather package includes leather seating, front side impact airbags, power driver's seat, memory driver's seat, power front passenger's seat, lit vanity mirrors and simulated leather trim on the doors. 

The memory driver's seat is great because you can have 2 different settings memorized. When you insert your key in the ignition, it reads the computer chip in the key and sets your seat to your preferred setting. This way, my husband and I don't have to manually adjust the seat everytime we are driving the car after the other person drove.

The leather seating is very comfortable and you don't stick to the seats because the leather is perforated, allowing air to circulate. The steering wheel is also leather wrapped, which is very comfortable while driving.

The Pathfinder seats 5, and includes a rear center lap belt. There are both front and rear headrests, as well as child seat anchors, which will come in handy when we have children. The rear seats recline and also fold down completely. 


<b>The Controls</b>

The dash is laid out very nicely, with easy access to everything. The gauges are illuminated and are easy to read, as is the digital clock. The dash in the LE is accented by faux wood paneling, which looks nice with my charcoal leather interior.

The radio controls are easy to reach and operate, and there are also remote radio controls located on the steering wheel, so you can change stations or raise/lower the volume. This comes in handy while you are driving because you can change stations without looking away from the road. The LE comes with a premium Bose stereo system, which includes a 6 CD in-dash CD changer, radio and cassette player.

Also standard on the LE is cruise control,and a universal remote opener (you can program up to 3 garage or gate openers into the transmitter so you don't have to carry the different openers with you). 


<b>Other Interior Features</b>

There is a digital thermostat and compass overhead, along with a sunglass holder within easy reach. There is also a power supply located next to the radio so that you can charge your cellphone, plug in a mini fridge, etc. There are 3 power supplies in the vehicle (front, rear and cargo).

The center armrest is actually a storage area, so you can store CDs, etc. There is a small shelf type insert that clips into place to hold small items like change, keys or anything like that. The armrest top is leather covered as well. There are two cupholders, one standard size, and one slightly larger to accomodate those super sized drinks.

There is also a folding center armrest in the rear, and also cupholders as well.

The cargo area is good sized, and has a couple small storage areas on either side. The area is covered in carpet, but there is another storage area underneath, which holds the jack. 


<b>Security</b>

The LE comes equipped with remote anti-theft alarm system 
and engine immobilizer to prevent car theft. Two key fobs come with the Pathfinder, which have buttons for locking and unlocking the car, as well as a panic button that sets off the alarm. This is great to have, especially if you are alone or in an area you are not familiar with.


<b>Overview</b>

If you are looking for a sporty but reliable sports utility vehicle, then you should really consider the Pathfinder. Nissan has a great reputation for reliability and resale value, and the Pathfinder is a perfect example of product excellence.

I really have to say that I love everything about my Pathfinder. I love the way it handles, the power, the interior layout -- everything. It's fun to drive, and looks great too, and I'm really glad I decided on this particular car. As I mentioned before, I was considering the 4Runner as well, but considering the Pathfinder was about $5,000 cheaper (fully loaded), I think I got the better deal.
