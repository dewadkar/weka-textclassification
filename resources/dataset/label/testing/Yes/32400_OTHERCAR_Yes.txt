            I bought this vehicle partially out of desperation. My old car had died and I need something reliable and economical to get me to and from work as well as something that no longer said &quot;broke college student&quot;. So after some very quick research, I settled on the Civic. I am very glad that I did. It is a wonderful vehicle. It is economical and reliable and sleek as well. It says &quot;educated choice&quot; in so many ways. On the technical side, it handles well (even in snow and rain), gets well over 25 miles to the gallon, stays warm when it needs to be warm, cool when it needs to be cool, and seems to be relatively trouble free. Granted, I haven't owned this car for very long but I have been around Hondas all my life and know that they are one of the most reliable vehicles produced.

On the downside, the 2 main complaints (if you want to call them that) are that the stereo on its own (without the aid of an amplifier) is not what I had expected and the air conditioner could be a little more powerful. But these are not major inconveniences at all. 

The layout of the dash is logical and the switches and gauges are easily accessible. The trunk is spacious and the backseat is relatively comfortable. If you have a child, I would recommend the 4 door as opposed to the 2 door. 

All in all, I feel that this was the best choice I could have made.<br><br>
