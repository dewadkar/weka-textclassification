            A few years ago, in January of 1992, I decided to buy my first new car. It came down to the Honda <b>Accord</b> and the Volkswagon <b>Jetta</b>. Well, I decided, that for the money, the <b>Jetta</b> was a better value. 

I didn't go into my purchase uninformed. I checked out Consumer Reports as well as other reviews to find information on the <b>Jetta</b>. Plus, since I had own a <b>Jetta</b> at the time (I had a 1981 and wanted to buy a 1991), the decision was pretty simple. I was able to get a 1991 VW <b>Jetta</b> for a good price as they were clearing them out for the new models (the <b>Jetta III's</b> to be specific). 

<b>Why a VW?</b> - I wanted a car that would last. Not just 100,000 miles, but more like 2 or 300,000 miles. European made cars do that with no problem and it's not uncommon to see a Volvo or a VW have 200,000 miles on their engine and still run strong. VW makes cars that can run literally forever if you take care of them. Plus, they get around 30 to 35 mpg, so they are really easy on gas. 

<b>Handling</b> - The <b>Jetta</b> handles pretty well. The one thing that always bothered me about this car was the amount of road noise that I would hear. The car was just really noisy. However, later VW models don't have that problem as VW has added insulation to the floor and interior to cut out the unpleasant sound. The VW <b>Jetta</b> GL (the model I owned) was a 4 cylinder engine. Not a lot of power, but enough pickup to make it up steep hills and zip through traffic in both the city and highway. 

<b>Comfort</b> - The seats in the <b>Jetta</b> are three way adjustable and are pretty comfortable. Plenty of leg room in the back and the car will seat five. The trunk is <b>huge</b> and can store multiple large suitcases with room to spare. 

<b>Price</b> - At the time, I paid $12,500.00 for this car (brand new), but you can easily get one for around $3,000 to 4,000 with around 100k miles on it, but don't let the high mileage scare you away, as I said, VW's will run forever if taken care of. 

<b>Reliability</b> - In the seven years I had my <b>Jetta</b>, I was not stranded once. Sure, I had to have some &quot;major&quot; things done to it once it hit 90,000 miles (brakes, bearing repack, new battery, timing belt, etc), but nothing too big like a new engine, transmission, or clutch. I always had regular service checkups done and had the oil changed every 3,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a good car that is dependable and will not eat up your money, the <b>Jetta</b> might be something to look into. The 1991 <b>Jetta</b> is an ideal car for a college student or a second family car. Affordable and well made, this car was meant to be driven, forever. <br><br>
