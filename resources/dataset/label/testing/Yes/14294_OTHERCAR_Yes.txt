            I bought my 2000 Dodge Ram 2500 4X4 Turbo Cummins diesel Quad Cab in December of 1999.  I live in Colorado and I tow both a boat and camp trailer so I needed a truck with plenty of horsepower and torque.  This truck really delivers!  Here&#146s what I like about it:

For a truck this powerful and large, the fuel economy is excellent.  When I&#146m not towing I get about 17 to 22 miles per gallon on the highway and 14 to 17 in the city.  Fuel economy is very speed-dependent.  Above 68 miles per hour, the turbo kicks in and the fuel economy drops, quickly if you have a lead foot!

The interior is well appointed, very comfortable with an excellent sound system and tons of storage space.  Like most quad cabs, the back seat is a bit short on legroom but there&#146s plenty of space to lie down and snooze!  One option I chose was the six way electronically adjustable driver&#146s seat with lumbar support.  This really allows you to fine tune the seat comfort to your needs.

This is a 3/4 ton rated, short bed truck but the towing capacity is enormous.  Depending upon your setup, you can tow up to 13,500 pounds.  When you are towing, the truck handles about the same as when not towing, and the power is there.

For me, the &#147macho look&#148 of the truck is also very important.  Wherever I travel, people always make positive comments about its appearance.

The only things I find slightly negative about the truck are:

Diesel engines are substantially louder than a gasoline engine.  It&#146s not the sound from the exhaust pipe either, but the actual sound of the engine.

Some people do not like the smell of the diesel exhaust, although I find it quite tolerable.

The cost of diesel fuel has increased greatly over the last few years and is typically priced between that of regular gas and mid-grade.

02/09/03:  I now have over 45,000 miles on the truck and I still love it.  I have had one problem - the fuel transfer pump went out at around 26,000 miles, but it was replaced under warranty in a timely manner.  I have driven across the country a few times in the Ram and the ride it comfortable, the power is excellent, and the economy is very acceptable!  I have never had problems finding diesel fuel anywhere.
