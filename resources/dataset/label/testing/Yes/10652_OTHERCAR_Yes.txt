            I bought my 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager when it was one year old -- and it's been one of the best purchases I've ever made!  After my second child was born, I really needed the space to haul kids, stroller, sports gear, etc.  The Voyager has given us lots of space for everything.

One of the best things about this mini-van is that it handles like a car!  I don't have to climb UP into it -- it's more like getting OVER into it.  There's enough height to give you better visibility, but not so much that it's awkward for people to get in and out of.  I rented a GMC Safari this summer on vacation, and my mother needed a step stool to get in and out of the back seat!!

Convenience:  There are cup holders all over the mini-van.  I also like the fact that the cruise control settings on are on the steering wheel instead of on the turn signal lever.  It's not a big deal, but I've gotten used to having the outside temperature and the compass direction displayed above me!  Another big convenience is that there is a real 12-volt outlet, so that we can hook up a TV/VCR combo in the rear seat and my son can watch on long trips, without having to snake a cord up to the front, or me having to disconnect my cell phone from the front 12-volt outlet!

Space &amp; Comfort:  We have captains seats in the middle row and a bench seat in the back -- so that when others travel with us, the people in the middle seats are as comfortable as the people in the front seats!  There is plenty of leg room all the way around, and handles appropriately place to help people that are climbing in to the rear seat.  Because it's the &quot;GRAND Voyager&quot;, it has the extra space behind the rear seat.  This has been great!  I keep a stroller and a couple folding lawn chairs back there at all times, yet there's still plenty of room for groceries, etc.

When you just want a little more space available from the rear, just release a lever and you can fold the rear bench seat forward, giving a flat surface to stack things on.  That's great for packing coolers, suitcases, etc. for weekend trips -- when you'd like a little more easily accessible space, but don't want to take the back seat completely out.

Having a toddler, I can't imagine having a minivan without having the second sliding door.  This allows me to put the car seat behind my own, which is MUCH more convenient than having to go around the vehicle at every stop we make!  Frankly, I can't imagine why any auto maker creates a van today without the second sliding door!

We are a family of four, but sometimes travel with my parents.  Having the Voyager has made it possible for all of us to travel in one vehicle comfortably.  I am thrilled that we bought this van!
