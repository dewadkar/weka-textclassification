            When I received this camera, I found the box much bigger than I expected. But when I pulled the camera out, I found it to be a good size, about the same as a point-and-shoot 35MM camera. The LCD panel on the back is 2.5&quot;, one of the largest of the cameras looked at, but the thing that made me practically squeal with delight was the viewfinder - it is movable (270 degrees) so that you can view your feet, the ceiling, yourself, all without moving the whole camera, just the viewfinder! 

I also found this camera has the most features for the money - a function wheel allows you to choose from regular color photos, black-and-white, sepia-tone, panoramic, night shots, sports shots to take those fast-moving photos, mini-movies to take up to 12.8 seconds of the past or future, and title recording to put a title on an image. 

The zoom has three options: 2x optical to 64mm, 2x digital to 128mm and 4x digital to 256mm. White balance can be automatically or manually selected, the flash can be turned off or left on automatic or switched to fill flash or red eye reduction mode. You can also go auto exposure or manual, the same with focus. 

The camera came with its own bag and wrist strap (most of the others charge extra for this) and a CD full of software: Adobe PhotoDeluxe 3.0, QV-Link, Spin Panorama, Spin Object, ixla Digital Camera Suite and PictureFun! Photo, Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.1 and Adobe Type Manager. It also comes with a video cable for easy hook-up to a camcorder, VCR, TV or other NTSC/PAL equipment. There are so many options with this camera, it's truly a camera buff's dream!

The QV-7000SX takes four AA batteries (it comes with Duracell's Ultra batteries, highly recommended, although you can order rechargeable batteries and a charger for around $40) or you can use the AC adapter. The batteries were easily popped in, then I switched the power on. 
A second later and what was in front of me appeared on the color LCD panel. I tried out the viewfinder (my feet still look big) and began to take photos using the various choices available, using the high-resolution mode. I also took a mini-movie of my dog chasing a ball down our hallway - he looked suitably goofy, but the quality was pretty darned good! 

Adding a title was probably the hardest thing to do, and that was pretty easy. I just printed out a title from my computer, aimed the viewfinder on it using the title mode, then snapped the shutter. I then went into PLAY mode, selected the photo I wanted to add the title to, positioned the title, hit the shutter button and the title was added. You can also go into the Menu and change the color of the title - pretty cool! 

The Menu also allows you to change the View; Tools to protect your images and create folders; choose from infrared transfer or QV-Link via the provided serial cable; Setup the format, date, video out, make a screen saver or convert the images to HTML to look at them on your web browser; and Delete functions. 

Other goodies on the camera: Self-timer, built-in digital clock and calendar with time stamp option, and F2.8 to F14 aperture with auto and manual switching. Now came the real test - transferring the images to my computer. I installed the QV-Link software and read the online manual before trying it out. I have an extra COM port on my PC, so I shut down my computer, hooked up the serial cable that came with the camera, plugged the other end into the camera (there's a panel on the top, making it easy to get at), then turned the computer and camera on. 

I opened QV-Link, tested to make sure the camera was connected - it was! I then went to the Camera pull-down menu and selected &quot;Get From Camera.&quot; After a moment, a &quot;film strip&quot; appeared on the screen, numbered by how many images I had taken. I selected one and noticed that the image I selected suddenly appeared on the LCD panel on the camera. Very impressive! I uploaded that image to my computer. When it appeared, it looked better than I thought it would, in fact, one of the best I've seen from a digital camera. I saved the image as a .jpg (you can also choose .pcx or .tiff for stills and .cam for the mini movies). 

I went back to the main menu and selected &quot;Get Camera Album&quot; and mini-shots of the images appeared in an album format on my computer screen. This way, I could look at all the shots I'd taken and select from there. Even more impressive! 

I was so taken with this camera, I bought it. You can't beat all the features for the price - $699. <br><br>
