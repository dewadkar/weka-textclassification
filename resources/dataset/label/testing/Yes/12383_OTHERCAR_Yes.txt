            Recently, I trade in my old 1991 Pontiac Sunbird LE for a used 2002 Pontiac Grand Am SE with 7600 miles.  I've been driving it for about a month and 1,000 miles now, so I feel I've formulated my final opinion on the vehicle that isn't going to change much in the future.

<b>Car Overview</b>
As I said, it's a 2002 Grand Am SE (the base model, not an SE1) with 7600 miles.  Some of the more notable options and base features are power locks, cruise, AC, CD player, driver and passenger front air bags, 4 cylinder 2.2L twin-cam engine, automatic transmission, tilt steering, and traction control.  This is pretty much a bare bones vehicle without power windows, seats, or mirrors, no keyless entry, and no real "frills", however I think the base options on the Grand Am are pretty complete.

That being said, the vehicle was extremely affordable.  One thing assisting in this affordability is the current market for used cars.  Most buyers are taking advantage of all the new car deals (low financing, large rebates) making the used car market a bit overloaded right now.  Coupled with the fact that one dealer told me 1 out of every 3 Pontiacs sold is a Grand Am and you can see how dealer's are willing to cut prices on these vehicles.

List price on my vehicle was $18,500.  Kelly Blue Book value for my zip code (53086, SE Wisconsin) is about $15,000.  I paid $12,700.  Something tells me that deals like this can be found on Grand Ams pretty much everywhere right now.

<b>Performance</b>
Obviously, there is marked improvement in performance over my last vehicle's 2.0L SOHC 4 cylinder using engine technology developed over 10 years ago.  That being said, the 4 cylinder in the Grand Am has plenty of horses to get you merged on to the interstate or pass a car with no problems.  Shifting is smooth and the response is immediate.  For those looking for more power, I test drove the V6 and can say that it definitely packs a punch (and a bit of a growl :) ).

The standard traction control seemed odd, to me, since it is a front wheel drive vehicle only.  You do have the option of turning it off with the press of a button.  I have already seen "Low Trac" light up on my dash indicating that the traction control system is working when starting from a stop sign under slippery conditions.  Whether or not it really made a difference, I can't really say.

<b>Interior</b>
Most of my gripes about the Grand Am fall under this category.  One of my biggest gripes about the Grand Am is the apparent lack of head room.  I'm an average man at 5'10" and 150lbs.   I also wear a baseball hat a lot.  When looking over my shoulder, it's not uncommon for my hat to hit the ceiling or sides of the vehicle.  I'm adjusting to this and it's less of a problem everyday, but it can still get on my nerves.

In addition, the front visor is virtually useless since mine seems to refuse to push flat against the windshield or at any angle other than perpendicular to the ground.  Thus, it reduces your visibility more than the glare of the sun does.

Finally, the drivers headrest (even at its lowest setting) seems high making the driver's side blind spot an obstructed view.  You can still see cars that are there, but it's not the kind of clear view I prefer when looking over my shoulder.  The same can be said of the view out the back window.  The rear spoiler (while fashionable) is quite high and takes some adjustment on the driver's part in gauging distance between objects and your rear bumper.

On the positive side, there is plenty of leg room for driver, passenger, and rear passengers.  The controls for the heater/AC and radio are laid out well and tilted towards the driver for easy viewing and the seats are quite comfortable.

<b>Experiences</b>
The Grand Am is a fun car to drive.  Steering is responsive and fairly tight.  The turning radius is excellent.  The car is quiet in the city as well as on the interstate with minimal wind and engine noise.

As it gets quite cold during the winters here in Wisconsin, it's nice to know that the car heats up quickly when driven, but not when idling or "warming up".  My advice is to just get in and go.  You'll be warm before you know it.  The rear defroster works quickly, too, but doesn't really give you more than a moderately sized rectangle out of the rear window.   It's better to brush off the snow instead.

Gas mileage is a bit of a question mark for me.  It's rated at 20mpg city and 29mpg highway.  Approximately 70-80% of my driving is highway and my tanks are usually 21-22mpg.  I'm a bit surprised that so little city driving can affect the overall gas mileage, but I'm also skeptical on the number since the weather is quite cold right now.  My experiences have taught me that gas mileage is always lower in the winter for a variety of reasons.

I also have a 4 month old daughter and am happy to say that the LATCH system is standard on all Grand Ams.  The LATCH system provides a quick, easy, and SAFE way to strap a car seat in to the back of the vehicle (if LATCH is supported by the car seat).  No more strap locks, grumbling, and cursing for me.  Securing the car seat in my Grand Am was quick and painless and it appears to be much more secure than before.

On a (somewhat) related note, one feature of the Grand Am that has me very pleased is the power locks.  When you press the lock button, it lightly dings a few times without locking the doors.  About 5 seconds after the last door is closed, the doors lock, the parking lights blink twice, and the horn toots (you can turn this off thankfully).  This makes getting my daughter out of the back seat an easier task.  I can open my door, hit the lock button, shut my door, open the back door, get my daughter out, shut the rear door and walk away.  Since it doesn't have keyless entry (e.g. a remote for locking the doors), this feature means I don't have to open the rear door before locking the vehicle or go through other charades.  And if you want the doors locked immediately, you can press the lock button twice.

To sum it all up, I really enjoy driving my Grand Am.  It's got some power and speed for me, room for my family, and is practical.  Most of my gripes are minor and fading fast and are probably more the result of having driven another vehicle for so long before this than anything else.
