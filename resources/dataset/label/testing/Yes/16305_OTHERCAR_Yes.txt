            I purchased my digital camera because I take a lot of photographs for my children's school.  I serve as a room parent and PTA volunteer and often supply photo collages for the teachers to display and for the PTA to use in newsletters, newspapers and yearbooks.  I found that the cost of the camera was minimal compared to traditional paper processing given the quantity of photos I take.

Though I chose this 1 Megapixel digital camera for the quantity of photos I take, the quality of the photos produced is another great reason to select this camera!  Using photo paper and my HP DeskJet 722C printer - a mere $150 printer - I can produce paper prints good enough to use for holiday cards!

The HP PhotoSmart C200 camera retails for around $300 - there is currently a $100 rebate if you purchase the camera with selected HP printers.

The best features of the C200 are the fine picture quality and the point and shoot ease of use.  The less desirable features?  The incredible appetite the camera has for batteries - 4 AA batteries take about 40 photos if you use the 2X zoom and the LCD display a lot.  I admit I have fallen in love with that LCD screen, and I have been clipping lots of coupons for batteries lately!  Another shortfall is the 8 second wait between photos - an eternity if your photography method is shoot, shoot, shoot and hope one of the pictures comes out great.  Nice photo editing and printing software is included, though even a cheap camera case is not.  

Overall, this is a super camera for the price.  I was not able to find a similar camera in the under $400 price range that I liked nearly as much.<br><br>
