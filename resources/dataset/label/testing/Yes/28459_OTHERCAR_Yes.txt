            What a great car!  My father just recently purchased a 2000 Toyota Avalon and he couldn't of have been more pleased.  Not only is the car close to perfection in every way, it can be bought for a reasonable price.  It is truly an amazing car!  Previous to the Avalon, my father was driving what is known to be the Ultimate Driving Machine, or in other words a BMW.  He has told me many times before how well the BMW handles and how fast it is and everything else about the car that is worth mentioning.  Now when I begin to talk to him about the Avalon, I can't get him to shut up!  He talks about how well its been holding up and how beautiful the handling is.  To be honest, I can't blame him at all because I myself have driven the car and love it to death.  The car has front wheel drive and handles better then any car I have ever driven, including the BMW.  For such a large car it is amazingly fast.  You can just feel the power when you begin to press on the gas.  Another feature of the car that makes it so great is its roominess.  It is huge!  I bet that a family of four could live in the back seats!  And of course the most obvious, the way in which it looks.  Of course this is my own opinion, but the Avalon is a beautiful looking car.  So if your looking for an affordable, well-made driving machine, you've come to the right place.<br><br>
