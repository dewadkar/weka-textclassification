            The Xterra is built on the Frontier Pickup frame and shares its driveline with the Frontier and Pathfinder. The frame is pretty beefy, and the whole vehicle is solid. One of the most notable features is that the Xterra (atleast mine) has a great paint job which seems to fight scratches, and cleans up nicely. In addition, the side steps do a good job at protecting the side of the vehicle from careless people who swing their doors open.

I didn't really test drive any others, aside from having driven an Explorer and a couple Grand Cherokees on other occasions. Reason for this is that there is nothing else that has the space and feel of the Xterra for under $30K. The Xterra has a more firm ride than the others, but it also handles better and doesn't rock back and forth as much.

With the manual transmission, the Xterra is plenty powerful to keep up with traffic. I don't recommend the automatic, as it suffers in performance; unless you aren't a road racer anyway! The 3.3l V6 has lots of torque at low RPM's, so it cruises around town easily.

I've discovered that the brakes are far better than any truck of SUV I've driven. They are progressive, strong, and the ABS works well on varrying surfaces, thanks to a sensor which controls the pulses according to stopping force.

Anyway, the Xterra is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a luxury SUV. It is designed with more utility in mind. It's a vehicle which fits nicely between the mini utes that you would be afraid of breaking off-road, and the luxury SUV's, which you would be afraid of getting dirty or scratched.
