            This is my Reliability Analysis of the 2002 Kia Rio we bought from Shaver Kia in San Bernardino (Feb 17, 2002). I am a Reliability Engineer working at a major defense company, so I can give some real insight into the reliability of this car.
First, let us note the difference between "quality and reliability". Often, people think they are the same, but they are NOT. Quality means that the car was assembled in Korea, and someone signed it off. When the car is shipped, the quality is DONE. That is when the reliability begins. The car must work, work well, and last a long time to be reliable.
So, where does it start? With the sale. We went to the local Ford dealer, and they basically won't let you have a car. They want to keep them. I wanted a white Focus, and I was told "How about a silver one. How about a blue one? How about one with a lot of options, but at the stripped cost? How about giving us some money, and we will look for one?" I think that Ford does not know how to sell a car.
I had been researching the Kia Rio. I really didn't want one, but they looked interesting, especially because they are cheap, cheap, cheap (Like I am.). On the radio, Shaver said that you could get a new Kia for under six grand. I went there, saw Eric, and said "Do you have one of those $6,000 Kias?" He slowly said "Ummmm, yes I do." He then had us drive it, examine it, look it over, re-check it, and we bought it. The Rio did not end up as $6,000 because we added the finance charge, other charges, $1,995 for an extended 100K/10 year bumper to bumper warranty (I think that is amazing), etc. But, basically, I DID get a $6,000 Kia (I'm still amazed about that). The Focus was more like 17 grand, plus, plus, plus, so I think that Kia is doing something amazing here.
So then, we drove it away. It has an engine and a transmission, and they both work. Hmmmm, not bad. The seats work. We got it home, 112 miles away, and it ran just fine. It went up the hills just fine. Part of the way home, I noticed something that I really didn't expect: It seemed to have a lot of power. This Kia has no air conditioner, but it seemed to have plenty of pep, and I really didn't expect to have that in the cheapest car available. I expected it to be anemic, and it just is not anemic. It may even be fast, but I am interested in breaking-in the engine properly, so I am driving slow. There are long, slow hills on the tollway going to Rancho Santa Margarita, and the car had no problem.
The next day, we had to return to Sunnyvale, near San Francisco, and we did just fine with the 421 miles. The car ran fine, but we drove about 55 to 60 all the way (during the break-in). I was really surprised how well it ran. I thought that a $6,000 car might crap-out on the way, but it didn't. I drove it, then sat on the passenger side with the seat back reclined, and then slept in the back across the rear seat. Everything just was great.
On the way home, I thought that something interesting was happening to me, that I was doing something great. After a while, I decided that this was perhaps similar to those people who bought the first Volkswagen Bugs, and decided that their car was wonderful. Here I was, a Reliability Engineer, driving one of the "most unreliable cars in the world", and finding that it is really great. I think that people who buy a Kia Rio (at this time) are blazing a trail for the future. It looks to me that the same car which is the lowest cost is also very reliable. We shall see. I want everyone to know that this is a long-term Reliability Test. I suppose I should also say that it is probably a lot of fun to drive.
Last night, I took it out shopping. I was having a little trouble with the accelerator (my foot was not setting correctly), and solved it by adjusting the seat back and forth. The driver seat has a lot of adjustments, and it can be changed a lot to fit you well. I was not expecting to get such a nice seat in a cheap car. I'm not sure, but it looks like one dial adjusts the butt area, one dial adjusts the back, the seat back adjuster adjusts the angle of the back, and then the seat rail adjuster allows the leg distance to the pedals to be adjusted. Pretty interesting, lots of nice details.
The trunk is really big. I wouldn't expect one this large in a small car. We could load all of the stuff for the trip home, plus it works great for shopping. The bottom lip is pretty low, so it is easy to load the trunk. Last night, I parked next to a Toyota Corolla, and I was amazed that the Rio is a lot larger than a Corolla. I wonder which one has a bigger trunk?
The engine is pretty surprising. I probably wouldn't expect double overhead cams, or 16 valves in a cheap car. I think that this will give me a lot of power and great gas mileage. We will see. The transmission is just fine. The car pulls fine in any gear as long as it is shifted right. We have had no trouble going up or down hills, and shifting is no problem for the 5 speed manual.
The car looks good. I am interested in a good-looking car, because most of the imports are really ugly (Like the Toyota Echo. The only time it looks good is when it is going over a cliff. There should be an ugly-tax, where people would be charged for driving cars with offensive designs). The Rio has some pretty nice headlights and taillights. The body has some shapes and movements which are really pretty well done. Overall, it looks like the Kia Rio was designed very well, and it may be a design which will continue to look good over the years.
Price: Even though people talk about reliability, what they really mean is that they are cheapskates. They want a cheap car. They say they want a cheap car, but they want a reliable car, but that is not what they mean. They want a CHEAP car. If it runs, that is even better. If it is reliable, that is unbelievable. So, maybe we are talking about something unbelievable. Of course, I may change my mind, but it looks like the Kia Rio may be able to make 100,000 miles. And may be fun. What I am talking about is that the Rio may be cheap and fun, like the old Volkswagen Bug.
Quality: The car is put together very well. Everything works. There are a lot of things on this car which only belong on other cars which cost more. I'm not used to having any special things on the cheapest car available. I think it is scary to think that the car works. But, it just might work. Time will tell.
Modern stuff: The car has a dual overhead cam engine. Very nice. It has a 5 speed transmission which works well. The seats are pretty nice, and very, very adjustable. The headlights are nice plastic which look up-to-date and work well. The taillights are large and nice, like the newest cars. The interior has lots of space. The trunk is big. The windows go up and down, and the doors open and close. The first rule in reliability is that it must work: The Kia works.
Plan: The next step is to make it work well. I need to break it in for 600 miles. Then I will check it to see if it works well.
I intend to update this Reliability Test as I continue to drive the Kia Rio.

UPDATE Feb 27, 2002:
The engine fell out, the transmission quit, the driver's seat was stolen, and the radiator drained. Now that I have your attention, I want to tell you that the Rio reliability test is running fine. It is not an XXX rated car, so far it is rated AAA. We started running at 70 all the way back from Southern Cal, and we kept up with the traffic except for the Ford Explorers which go 90. The car goes up the mountains around the Grapevine just great. I'm somewhat amazed that the car has a dual-overhead cam engine, and it works great. The five speed transmission seems to be very smooth. We have over 2,000 miles on it now. We really like it, especially the huge space in the trunk. During the week, we are using it for driving to work. It looks good in the driveway. During the weekend, we are driving it from Northern Cal (Sunnyvale) to Orange County (Rancho Santa Margarita), by way of the 5 Freeway. It is a great commuter car.
UPDATE Mar 4, 2002
Ran the car to Orange county and back this weekend. Put on another 2,000 miles. The car ran fine again. It will go 70 all the way, and seems to have plenty of power to pass, if the need arises.

Radio: The new Rio we got didn't have a radio. So, I figured that I would have to find out how to put the wires under the floor mats, or something. But, when I was unloading the trunk, I noticed that there were two speakers installed into the rear shelf area, and they had wires connected to them. Did that mean that the car was pre-wired? I looked at the front doors, and I couldn't tell if the speakers were there or not. Anyhow, I went to Fry's Electronics in Sunnyvale and bought a Kenwood KDC-516s radio-CD deck. It included free installation. I went to get it installed at Fry's (they did a great job), and the guy said that the car was already wired, with speakers, and the connector for the radio was on the backside of the plastic cover on the dash, but that the new radio had to be hard-wired. I agreed, and they installed it and charged me $20 for the special wiring setup. The guy also said the speakers were pretty good, so I didn't really need new (better) speakers. So, now it works, and sounds good. The antenna also was already installed, so it just had to be connected to the new radio. I suppose I am surprised that KIA made everything so easy. I may install better speakers later, but the ones which are there sound real good.
UPDATE June 10, 2002: The Rio is really a great car. It runs just fine. It can go at fast freeway speeds all day. Maybe I would recommend the 5-speed over the automatic because it is a lot of fun to drive. The Kenwood CD deck makes the car a joy to drive on the freeway. Getting 37 MPG. Looks like a great car for a single girl, reminds me a lot of the VW bug when it came out, all of the dads got them for their little girl. And it is affordable for dad, also.
UPDATE 7-30-2002: It is still runing just fine. I may be wrong, but I think this car is a lot of fun to drive. We have almost 10K on it now.
UPDATE 12-18-2002: We have 15,000 miles on our 2002 Kia Rio, and it just keeps running. We really like it. I happen to like it because it is fun to drive, and I think it is fast. We get 37MPG. Next test will be to run it from Calif to Alabama, to see how a Rio acts on a long, long trip.
UPDATE 6-10-03: The Rio just keeps going, no problems yet. We did something good at 10,000 miles: We put in Mobil 1 synthetic oil. That's a trick I learned a long time ago, I have been using it since 1980. Mobil 1 easily makes 7,000 miles between changes. If you want your Rio to last, go to WalMart and have them put in Mobil 1 for $30. Put it in at 10,000 miles, then every 7,000 or whatever you think. We also had the tires rotated, but that's about it.
UPDATE 8-2-03: Now have 27,000 miles. Had a problem with the rear wheel bearings. The car started having a loud grinding noise from the wheels, so took it in. The Fullerton Kia dealer said the rear bearings were shot. They were replaced for free. Question: If the bearings last 25K, can I expect to replace them every 25K? A problem like this is usually caused by using a lower quality bearing supplier, because they should last 300,000 miles. KIA AMERICA in Irvine CA: Pay attention...We need to take care of this. It is a stupid way to lose sales. Otherwise, the car is fun to drive, is especially peppy at freeway speeds. It is faster than a Honda Civic, I can pull away in 3rd easily. The Mobil 1 oil is doing a great job.
