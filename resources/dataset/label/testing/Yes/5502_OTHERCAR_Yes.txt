            We went to a car lot looking for a car. I had gotten a new job and it was 30 mins from our house. Since, husband also worked in the same town as my new job(the 30 min away one), we decided that we really needed two cars. Upon arriving at the carlot, we looked at lots of cars.

The salesman was telling us &quot;how about this one? or this one? or that one?&quot; You know how they do! Finally we walked over to this black car. It was a 1992 Chevy Cavalier (this was early in 1996). This car was nice on the outside and had nice interior. We test drove this car and were satisfied with this being a reliable used car. 

We drove this same car until Nov. of 1999 when some lady hit me and totalled the car. I am sure that if she had not hit me, that we would still be driving it today. Overall, I was very satisfied with my Cavalier. It was a reliable car. Even as a used car it was reliable.<br><br>
