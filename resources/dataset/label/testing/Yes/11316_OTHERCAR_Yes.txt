            My first car was a Mitsubishi Galant LS, all power everything. So, naturally when I had to rent a car, and they had another Mitsubishi, I jumped on the chance.

I got a 2001 Mirage ES. Not a bad car, somewhat difficult to get used to at first, having driven a Galant for some time now. Everything was easy to use, all the controls, etc.. Radio was a snap to set the presets and well, it was pretty much self explanitory.

I took this car on a mini-trip to a family get-together about 2.5 hours away. Now granted, if the trip had really taken 2.5 hours, it wouldn't have been so bad I don't think. But I got lost... In the middle of NOWHERE. Running low on gas and crying. This car got amazing gas mileage though, I only stopped for gas 3 times the whole trip (there and back) If I hadn't driven it so much before we actually left for the drive, it would have only been 2 stops... and If we hadn't gotten lost, it might have cut out that last fill-up. Did great through construction, and the suspension really amazed me, driving through awful conditions and then normal conditions it seemed to feel the same. The seats got a bit uncomfortable after about 3 hours, but most car seats do that anyway. 
The lack of cruise control did leave me wishing I had my car for awhile.
The stereo made me very happy.. It was loud and clear and had perfect clarity and performance, especially for a stock radio/speaker system.
Handling: I could u-turn on a small 2 lane road without having to back up and go at it again. Very nice.
Smooth ride and overall great value.
I wouldn't buy this car, but I would drive another if it was given to me, or I rented it.

(I wouldn't buy it because I like my car, and if bought another I would definitely get another Galant)

Overall this is a great starter car, fast, and affordable.
