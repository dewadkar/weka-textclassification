            Drove my '88 Cherokee Pioneer, 4.0L, auto for 200,000 miles and it's still running great.  Purchased to pull a 3,000 lb boat, and daily commuter to work, the Cherokee has proved to be extremely dependable.  No major mechanical or electrical system problems.  Replaced computer chip at 120,000 miles.  I reside in Minnesota, so the salt and sand that is applied to snow-packed highways in winter caused surface rust.  For a small SUV, the 170 hp 6-cylinder engine delivers plenty of power.  It is not plush, roomy or designed for back-seat passenger comfort.  The rear suspension needed to be improved with air shocks.  Strongly recommend this vehicle for sports enthusiasts who are interested in: towing trailers, hunting, fishing, and skiing.<br><br>
