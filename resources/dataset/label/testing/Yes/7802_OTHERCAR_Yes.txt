            We bought our '94 SL-1 brand spanking new (13 miles on the odometer) in late 1993. We had been looking at Corollas, Civics, Prizms, etc., and were disappointed in what was available for the price. We stopped at the Saturn showroom on a whim and fell in love. The ride, the quality, the price -- there was no comparison.

One thing that particularly impressed me was the ability to order a car almost like you�d order a pizza � by selecting the options we wanted instead of being limited to �packages.� For example, we wanted cruise control but could not find a Toyota or Honda in our price range that included this option; it was always part of a package that added too much to the cost of the car. With the Saturn we could pick one option, such as the cruise control, or even options that are generally part of a very expensive luxury package, such as leather seats or a sun roof, without being forced to invest in other options. Is there any other car in America that you can buy with leather seats but without power windows? I doubt it! Sadly, I believe this is no longer true of Saturn.

The price was extremely reasonable compared to comparable cars. Of course, it�s not quite fair to compare sticker price to sticker price, since the Saturn had a �no dicker� lower price, and you would be able (or even expected) to pay less than sticker for the other cars. But even taking that into consideration, we were able to get more car for less money. After adding cruise control and power door locks, our car cost about $14,000. The buying experience was extremely pleasant, and there was a 30-day, no questions asked money-back guarantee.

We discovered another nice thing about the �no dicker� price when it was time to buy a tag. In Oklahoma, the price of your tag is based on the MSRP of the car, not the amount you paid (and I suspect it works this way in other states). Therefore, if we had bought a different make, we would have paid more for the tag since the sticker price would have been higher, even though we actually paid $1000 or $2000 less than the sticker price. We also found that insurance was less expensive than for many comparable cars. Combine these with the low maintenance costs and great gas mileage, and our car was even more affordable than we realized it would be.

I loved my Saturn. I felt safe and secure. Driving was so effortless, I felt like it was an extension of my body. Even with its anemic 85 hp engine, it seemed to have more power than the other cars we had test-driven. There were so many thoughtful and functional details. For example, the rear seat folded forward to allow access to the trunk� you could fold both sides or one side (60/40 split). The radio was placed above the climate control console, unlike most other cars, because you�re more likely to mess with the radio while you�re driving, so why not put it closer to you? So I wouldn't win the Indy 500 -- it was still a safe, dependable, affordable, fun, distinctive little car. 

It wasn't a perfect relationship. The cruise control failed several times and was replaced twice. The third time it started acting up, the car�s warranty had expired. I thought it should have been replaced anyway, since the problem had originally started while under warranty, but Saturn did not agree. Little things started to rattle after 80,000 miles. The automatic seatbelts were a slight annoyance (and were discontinued soon after we bought our car). There was no passenger-side airbag. The lack of cupholders was always an issue (an optional dealer-added armrest did include one poorly-placed cupholder). But I still loved my little car. 

"Little" became an issue when our daughter was born in 1999. Ironically, we had purchased the car for a �family sedan,� and it was the largest car I had ever owned (or felt comfortable driving) at that point. But suddenly the trunk was too small and the back seat too narrow. We also found that few car seats really worked well in it. But I didn't care. We'd just buy a bigger car and keep the Saturn as a wonderful second car.

Unfortunately, in September 1999 my beloved Saturn was totaled in an accident. Even from the grave it held its value quite well� the insurance settlement for a car that was five years old and had almost 90,000 miles was just a little less than half the original cost. It was a great car, and I still miss it.
