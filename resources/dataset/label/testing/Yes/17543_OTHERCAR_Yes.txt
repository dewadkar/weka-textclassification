            Having been the owner of three jeeps in years past, I feel I have a good knowledge about this vehicle. I have purchased jeeps for a couple of reasons.  They are one of the best four wheel drive vehicles on the market today that are street legal.  A jeep also gives the image of masculinity and power.  

I love the jeep's performance in snow, mud, etc. Hill climbing in 4low is amazing. With the right traction, a jeep can climb almost anything.  I am an outdoors person and this car suits me perfectly. 

I hate the maintenance.  It seems they break down more then my other cars. This could also be because they are driven harder then my other vehicles. Jeeps are a blast to drive.  I love driving it around town.  One draw back is how bumpy it is.  Due to the hard suspension, you feel most bumps.  

I think this is a good vehicle for people who like four wheeling, outdoor sports, or live in a snowy/muddy area.  Overall, a great vehicle and machine with incredible power.  The price might be a little steep for what you get.  On the other hand, there is nothing like it. <br><br>
