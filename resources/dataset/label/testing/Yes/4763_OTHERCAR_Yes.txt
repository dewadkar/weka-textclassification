This car is absolutely the best car I have owned or driven. This car handles like a dream with the sports package; a perfect compromise for sporting curves without kidney bashing harshness.  The sports package tires stick like glue (Dunlop SP8000E)

The tiptronic is again a perfect compromise.  I don't want to push a clutch in and out 6000 times on the way to work in traffic and back.  However, in a perfect world, I would love the control of a manual tranny.  The tiptronic isn't as nice as a manual, but has no clutch...I use the tip function 99% of the time.

The FrontTrak is unbeatable as a front wheel driver.  I am by nature averse to front wheel drive...I like rear wheel drive cars, but you CANNOT TELL this is a front driver...Audi has made torque steer non-existant.  On most hard corners/curves, it is almost neutral, but it will plow a bit if pushed hard.  Get off the gas &amp; the nose will tuck right in. 

Engine,
Objective: 190 horses, 207 ft-lbs torque.
Subjective: plenty of power unless you want a &quot;real&quot; sports car...then look at the S4.  It gets into it's torque curve around 2800-3000 RPM, so the tiptronic or manual tranny must be used to keep you in the rev-range, but it isn't hard once you practice.  Loads of fun to boot.

Summary:  I haven't found anything to dislike after 16,000 miles (ok, well the power window buttons are a bit too far back on the door!).  This car makes me grin ear to ear every time I drive it.  Even sitting in traffic, it's a blast.  Dash layout, steering wheel, seats, everything...perfect.  Compared to a 1999 BMW 328iA that I test drove, this car is as quick, a bit nicer on the interior, a tad bit smaller inside (rear seat legroom), and a heck of a lot cheaper.<p>
