            My white Jeep Cherokee 88 &quot; The Stallion&quot; as we affectionately referred to it as, was my first vehicle and the only vehicle who I actually became a part of. All of my friends loved it and it was easily the best car of my grade level, until everyone started getting new cars ,including me but that is a different story( see also My Montero Sport the love of my life, also by me). 

It was hard saying goodbye to &quot; The Stallion&quot; but that day had to come.  It seemed as though there was nothing that Jeep couldn't do, we took it mudding, off roading, everything and it took it all. It had some minor problems while I was stile driving but it was nothing that wasn't fixable.  The new ones are probably even better than mine was. I speak from experience when I say that Jeep Cherokees are finely made vehicles.<br><br>
