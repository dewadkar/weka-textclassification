            <b>Summary:</b> From a family man's point of view, my 2000 Honda Accord has been a dream.  It's comfortable, safe, roomy enough for kids and accessories, and exudes a great big aura of reliability.  What more can you ask for?

<b>Relevant Personal Background:</b> I'm not a professional race car driver, or a mechanic, or an engineer.  I don't even know a carburetor from a catalytic converter.  I'm just a guy who's married with one kid (and maybe another sometime soon) and who uses a car to complete the daily tasks of living in a mid-sized city.  Therefore, I'm evaluating the 2000 Accord in terms of its performance for me and my family, not in terms of statistics or benchmarks.

<b>Comfortable and Roomy</b>
I'm not the biggest guy on the planet, but at 6' I do tend to cramp inside a Ford Festiva, and I even bend in weird ways in the 2000 Toyota Corolla and 2000 Chevy Cavalier I've rented recently.  I don't have a space problem in the Honda.  This made it a lot easier for me when I recently drove my Accord from Arizona to North Carolina -- no odd aches at the end of the day.

I'm also comfortable putting my baby in the back seat.  Look out when you're buying a car, O parents, for back seats that are overly molded in the bottom cushions.  In my experience they form an uneven base for a car seat, so the seat wobbles a little more.  Not so in my Accord.  Because its back seat is flat compared to other cars, a car seat fits more firmly.  In addition, there's a tether on top for extra security.

Because the Accord is roomy, it's also easier for someone in the front seat to get to a little one in the back seat in those moments when (who knows how) your little angel has obtained a plastic bag and is trying to stuff it down his or her esophagus.

<b>Safe and Reliable</b>
When I recently rented 2000 models of the Toyota Corolla and Chevy Cavalier, I swore I could hear some bolt getting jostled out of its surely important place as I drove down the road.  In other words, those cars just felt rickety.  Rickety new cars mean really rickety old cars that need to get repaired all the time.  Certainly cars like the Cavalier have had pretty mediocre repair records in the past decade (and yes, I unfortunately speak from experience -- but also check out Consumer Reports).

By contrast, the Honda Accord just oozes quality.  My car moves as a single smooth unit, not as twelve odd parts swaying and grinding against one another.  Every part of the car I come in contact with feels solid and solidly connected to other parts. It's not one of those cars that has so smooth a ride that you get queasy, but we don't get that jostled feeling on the road either.  The car handles very well with turns, starts, swerves and stops.  All these little things add up, and I feel I don't have to worry about what the car's going to do -- I just go ahead and drive.

The car also has a substantial feel to it.  I wouldn't have cared a year ago before my son was born, but my paternal instincts have kicked in.  I certainly don't want to drive my kid around in a Tupperware car that will crush around him if it's nicked by a passing Yugo.  Unfortunately, I had the safety of the Accord tested in a fender bender a few months ago.  Fortunately, the car reacted very well: most damage remained in the easily replaced cosmetic portions of the car, while the solid frame of the car remained undamaged.  More importantly, even though we came to an abrupt halt, the car absorbed the impact well and we didn't even sustain whiplash.

My sense of the Accord's safety and reliability is backed up by a great safety and repair record for the Accord (again, refer to Consumer Reports).  You can feel secure driving this car.

<b>In Sum...</b>
In sum, the 2000 Honda Accord is a great choice for families.  It's comfortable, roomy, reliable and safe.  I have no idea what the car's horsepower is, or how the engine's configured, or how quickly the car can go from 0 to 60 mph in a rainstorm on a Tuesday on a 15 degree incline.  What I do know is that in my experience, this is a solid car I've been able to use with trust.  For me, that's what matters.
