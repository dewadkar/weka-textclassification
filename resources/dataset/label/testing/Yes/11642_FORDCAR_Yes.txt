            The Ford Explorer is a hunter�s best friend. I personally hunt, and I can assure you that is you buy a ford explorer will not be let down. The reason why I bought it was because I had an old van that had to many miles on it and I wanted to trade it in towards the purchase of a new one. So I was walking around the dealership and I saw the Explorer and I knew right away that was what I wanted. So that�s why I bought it. The thing I like the most about the explorer is that it is very dependable and it is very durable. I have taken it hunting and I haven�t had an ounce of trouble with it. The only down side to the ford Explorer is that, well the interior that I chose was different from the one that I had originally chose. The problem with my explorer is that it didn�t come with a CD player or any entertainment feature, which I thought would be included in the package. Other than that I don�t think that there is any thing wrong with the Ford Explorer, I think that it is a very well made SUV.
