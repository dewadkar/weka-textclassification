            If you are in the market for your first digital camera and do not want to spend a lot of money, then this camera is for you.

The HP PhotoSmart digital camera allows you to take pictures that can be downloaded onto your computer or viewed on your television screen.  

Some of the features are:
1152 x 872 resolution
8mb removable CompactFlash memory card
1.8 LCD Monitor
2x digital zoom
auto focus
red-eye reduction

If you do decide to buy this camera, make sure you buy the battery charger and rechargeable batteries.  The camera came with regular batteries, so I used them.  By the time I took 22 picture using the &quot;Fine&quot; photo quality mode and downloaded them to my PC, the batteries were dead.  The download was a little slow.  It took over 5 minutes to download the pictures on a Pentium 500.  The download time is faster when using a USB Memory Card Reader.  

The picture resolution from this camera is great.  Before I bought this camera, I did a lot of comparison shopping.  For the price, this little camera's pictures have surpassed some of the higher priced cameras.

Another thing that sold me on this camera was the fact the there is a cover that slides over the camera lens. I like that protection.  But be care when handling the camera.  Try not to put your finger prints on the 1.8 LCD screen.  There are kind of hard to remove.

The tripod mount is in a funny place.  It is not in the dead center of the bottom of the camera. It is on the bottom, off to on side, and near the front of the camera.

All in all this is a great camera for the first time digital camera user.
