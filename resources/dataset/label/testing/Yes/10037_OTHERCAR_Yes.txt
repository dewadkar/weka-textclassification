            When my 88 Plymouth Sundance kicked the proverbial bucket, I needed another car fast. I looked at used Jettas and Passats, but I was relatively short of cash and obviously needed something I could afford. I bought a new 2000 Sephia for a few thousand less than I would've paid for a used Jetta. I love the roominess most of all... lots of leg room for even my 6-foot-tall dad in the backseat. And this'll sound shallow, but the color -- Cobalt Blue in my case -- is stunning. Lots of sparkly depth. The trunk is spacious, too, and the dual airbags were a big selling point for me.

It's mostly a dream to drive. A nice amount of pickup, and it's a smooth quiet drive if you don't try to gun the engine. There's an overdrive feature that makes quick-speedups a bit jarring. It gets fabulous mileage on my stop-and-go commutes -- about 28mph!

I think this car is a great one for non-pretentious people who want to get where they need to go comfortable with a minimum of expense and fuss. It would make a great second family car or first car for a young driver. If you want reliable, comfortable transportation, the Sephia is worth a look.<br><br>
