            <b>Let's talk baseball for a minute.  When your favorite player steps up to the plate, you want him to confidently point out to the stands, wink at the pitcher, and knock the living daylights out of the ball, right?  <i>Outta the park</i>, right?  ... I assume you'd expect nothing less from your new car purchase.</b>

... A lousy segue, I know.  Plus, I'm going to spare you the suspense... on paper, the 2001 <b>3.2 CL Type-S</b> has all the equipment to knock a ball into orbit.  In practice, though, the Acura 3.2 CL Type-S won't do that.  Try... an <i>inside-the-park</i> home run.  More on that later.


<b>GUNN ACURA DEALERSHIP IN SAN ANTONIO, TX:</b>
After doing my homework, I ventured out to Gunn Acura (located off I-10 close to DeZavala) to take a hard look at the CL.  For Texans considering an Acura, I recommend this dealership.  For one, the salespeople are first rate.  They are <b>paid by salary, not commission</b>, so the pressure and under-handed tactics aren't there.  The gentleman who I dealt with was named John Hadley.  He was very friendly and allowed me to take the CL out for as long as I needed (which was a long time!).  Second, the <b>prices are set, and non-negotiable</b>.  After doing some research, I found them to be <i>very</i> competitive.  The best part, of course, is that there is no haggling needed.  For those who are wondering, it <i>is</i> possible to get a slightly better price elsewhere, but the peanuts you save would be far eclipsed by the hairs you have to pull out to get them.  There.  I've said my speech, and am awaiting a check in the mail.  I'm kidding.


<b>BACKGROUND ON THE CL:</b>
The Acura CL was first introduced in 1996.  You may remember its very angular look, one which turned off many car critics.  Still, the CL accounted for 25% of Acura's sales.  With the passage of time comes changes, however, and Honda/Acura soon realized they had new challenges to face.  Foremost among these were predictions by market gurus that the demand for luxury coupes would sky-rocket by 150% in the next few years.  The problem with that is that other car makers did their homework too, putting in their heavy hitters (like the the BMW 3-series coupe, the Benz SLK 320, Toyota Solara, and the Volvo C70).  Unless the CL evolved with the times, it would soon be outclassed.  

Evolve it did, and in my review I'll be sure to discuss what came out of the ashes from the CL's complete overhaul.


<b>EXTERIOR:  9</b>
The new CL shares a global platform with the Honda Accord and the four-door Acura TL.  When I first heard of this, I assumed that the CL was just another "clone" of its siblings.  Upon further research, I found I was wrong.  For starters, Acura tweaked the body to increase torsional and bending rigidity by 6% and 23% respectively.  Such changes bring about several benefits, such as better handling and ride qualities, as well as increased impact-absorbing capability.  According to the Acura press release, 75% of the CL's unibody structure is <i>exclusive</i> to the CL.  In other words, <b>the CL is a bonafide coupe, not just a two-door version of the Acura TL.</b>

If I could steal a Disney name to describe the CL's looks, I'd choose "Sleeping Beauty".  The <b>"beauty"</b> part is obvious: sharp lines flow uninterrupted from the long sloping hood to the rear.  The trunk doesn't even have a keyhole, which provides added security and one less hiccup in the car's exterior curves.  Don't worry, it can be opened with the keyless remote, a remote release button in the car, or the kidnap escape latch inside the trunk, just in case.  The <b>"sleeping"</b> part of the CL's looks is the first shred of evidence that it won't knock the ball out of the park but go for something more subtle.  There are no shiny rims, spoilers, or faux hood scoops.  Rather, the styling is much more subdued.  While sporty enough to pique the interest of pimply faced teenagers in their Mustangs, the CL is one of the best sleeper cars if I've ever seen one.  As I was soon to learn, its aggressive nature belies its quiet exterior.  A wolf in sheep's clothing, if you will.


<b>INTERIOR:  9</b>
The interior of the CL is all about class.  <b>Fit and finish is superb</b>, with very few exceptions.  You <b>can only seat four</b> in the CL, as the rear seats are true bucket seats.  Speaking of which, <b>the CL's seats have got to be <i>the</i> most comfortable and supportive that I have experienced</b>.  Unless you have a very large frame, you will find this to be no exaggeration.  Side bolstering is more than adequate for even the most aggressive driving situations.  We're talking power 8-way heated perforated leather seats... with two memory settings. <i>Standard</i> on every CL.  

Visibility is great, fore and aft.  The low stance of the hood allows you to see everything up front, while the thin pillars in the rear cut down on potential blind spots.

Access to the back is made easy by automatically sliding front seats, as well as a seatbelt that slides out of your way.  The rear seats are comfy but things get really tight if the driver is tall.  Headroom back there is pretty sparse: at 6'3", my head would touch the roof if I straightened up.  Access to the trunk is made possible by a lockable pass-through trap door (the seats don't fold down, which is a pity).  

The CL is full of little storage cubbies to put your stuff.  The front center console sports a two-tier storage compartment, and a nuclear missile style trap door opens to reveal two cup holders (which will only hold your standard sized cups).  Even the rear passengers are treated to a center lockable storage console, and an armrest with two cup holders.

The driver-oriented dash is cleanly laid out, with no gap tolerances whatsoever.  Controls are easy to reach and intuitive, with the exception of the heated seat controls, which are hidden under the radio and behind the shifter.  The wheel comes with tilt but not telescoping feature.  This may be a cost-cutting move on Acura's part.

The automatic climate control works quietly and very efficiently.  The 6-speaker Bose radio was decent, though less than what I expected.  Only bass and treble can be adjusted, too.  As compensation, a front-loading 6 CD changer is standard.


<b>ENGINE:  9</b>
Okay, even an inside-the-park home run requires muscle, and believe me friend, the Type-S has got it.  <b>The 260hp, 232lb.-ft. torque, 3.2L V6 is an absolute gem.</b>  Based on the naturally aspirated 225hp engine found on the base CL, a high capacity, dual-stage induction system and a free flowing exhaust gives the Type-S bragging rights for the most powerful 6-cylinder in its class.  Off the line, the CL Type-S <b>accelerates with acute vigor</b>, accompanied by a satisfying engine note (official 0-60 is around 6.7s).  More than just brawn, however, is the smoothness with which the car takes off.  Thanks to VTEC technology, <b>the torque curve is admiringly accommodating</b>, making for excellent throttle response at a wide range of speeds.  On the highway, I tested this several times, and the Type-S passed with flying colors.

Why not a 10, then?  Well, perhaps I can sum it up in a whisper: <b><i>WHAT THE HECK IS THIS CAR DOING WITHOUT A MANUAL TRANSMISSION?!</b></i>  Apparently, the corporate big-wigs decided their demographic wouldn't be seeking a manual, and decided not to make one.  I feel it's a tragic miscalculation on their part, because this may be what causes prospective buyers to look elsewhere.  There is something to be said for the offered transmission, though (Lord knows those guys at Acura do try).  As can be found in lots of cars these days, a "manumatic" is standard.  Just slide the shift lever toward you, and a flick of the wrist up or down puts shifting in your hands.  The manumatic, designed to be 10% faster shifting than while in automatic mode, is certainly one of the best that I've seen.  And, a computer override prevents you from blowing the engine, or stalling it.  Plus, the "Grade Logic" system that is found in other Honda models is standard.  So if you're going down a steep slope, the CL won't allow itself to speed up inappropriately.

... But the fact that no manual transmission is even offered is a pretty big minus in my book.

<b><i>UPDATE!</b> The 2003 model will be available with a 6-speed manual transmission!  Early reports are optimistic about this new setup.  Will go on sale in early March of 2002.  Check it out:  http://www.edmunds.com/reviews/roadtests/firstdrive/48981/article.html</i>

<b>RIDE:  8</b>
The CL Type-S is stiffer sprung than the base CL, which gives you a <b>very sporty but not jarring ride</b>.  The only exception I found was when I felt highway expansion joints and minor road imperfections making themselves a little too well known in the cabin.  Outside of that, the CL is a <b>champ on the highway and in the city</b>.  When you punch the gas, the engine lets out a very nice growl.  When coasting, though, you don't hear a sound.  There were several times that I took the car to 90 mph without even realizing it.  Be sure to have a radar detector handy.


<b>HANDLING:  9</b>
I read a <i>Car & Driver</i> article that criticized this part.  Here's a quote: "[The CL] lacks the necessary balance and fluidity that we want from a sporting car."  Well guys, about balance you may have a point:  about 62% of the car's weight is located in the front.  Plus, the car is front wheel drive.  Still, I must disagree with the experts' assessment on this one (many other happy CL owners seem to agree, as they wrote angry letters to C&D in the next issue).  
For one, I felt the speed sensitive <b>steering was very eager and communicative</b>.  Even during aggressive driving in rainy weather, I never felt the car disobey my directions even once.  The steering assist was perhaps a little too variable for my tastes, but I eventually got accustomed to it.  
Second, despite their reservations, <b>this car is plenty fun to drive</b>.  For example, its Vehicle Stability Assist feature, which is great for maintenance of control in emergency situations can be shut off to let you peel out if you want to.  The four-channel ABS have been applauded by many critics, including myself.

There's other equipment I haven't mentioned that keeps the Type-S in control, but I can tell you that I felt all the components working in harmony to move the Type-S with confidence... I came away wondering what the heck the folks at Car and Driver were talking about.

Sure, pitted against a Toyota MR-2 Spyder, or even the BMW 3-series, the front-wheel drive CL might be the clumsier dancer.  Still, <b>it handles itself with plenty of poise and grace.</b>


<b>RELIABILITY:  9</b>
Like all Honda/Acura products, the CL has had <b>proven reliability</b> since its birth.  The parts are 70% US/Canadian.  The engine is American.  The transmission is Japanese.  Final assembly point is Marysville, OH, where the proven Acura TL and Honda Accord are built.  Plus, the standard Acura warranty is pretty good:  4 years, 50,000 miles, including roadside assistance.


<b>SAFETY:  8</b>
Although the car hasn't been officially tested in crash tests, it comes with a host of equipment that provides for a safe ride.  They are: Vehicle Stability Assist, standard traction control, four-channel ABS, seat belt pretensioners, height-sensing side impact airbags, and two-stage dual airbags.  Acura also made the CL to meet the new 2002 federal head-impact safety regulations.  Advanced safety-cage construction with side-impact door beams are good protection in collisions as well.  Standard xenon headlights give better coverage than halogen headlamps.

As for security, get this:  in addition to the remote keyless entry, the CL has reinforced door key cylinders and latches to make a break-ins tougher.  If broken into or if the engine is started with the doors locked, the horn sounds, the lights flash, and the engine is immobilized. 


<b>VALUE:  9</b>
Okay, here's the final dagger that makes an inside-the-park home run so sweet:  the Type-S is a <b>screaming value</b>.  Why?  You get excellent feature content, proven Acura reliability and resale value, for a price at less than $30 grand for a loaded-to-the-gills CL Type S (if you can bargain well enough).  At the Gunn dealership in San Antonio, the no-haggle price for a fully loaded Type-S was $28,693.  Compared with other competitors, there is really no comparison here.


<b>VERDICT:  INSIDE-THE-PARK HOMERUN IS EVEN SWEETER</b>
This car is not an in-your-face performance machine, nor is it of the blatant live-in-the-lap-of-luxury variety.  This car is more subtle, more svelte on both fronts.  I highly recommend that you check this car out, because I had a ton of fun driving it and, once the money starts coming in, this would be one of my Top Three choices for myself.

<b>AVERAGE SCORE FOR THE 3.2 CL TYPE-S:  8.75 out of 10</b>
<b>VARA'S PERSONAL RATING:  9 out of 10</b>
