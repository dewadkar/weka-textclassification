            In the early 90&#146s, I had the privilege of traveling in Japan. While there, I was regularly driven around by two friends who worked at the medical clinic I was visiting. I will never forget the experience, not only for the wonderful things I saw and learned about, but also for the amazing cars that we drove around in. The lab director had a gorgeous sedan, while one of the technologists drove the sleekest, sexiest coupe I have ever had the pleasure of driving in. It was like a Jaguar on some kind of William Gibson-esque MDMA trip. One of the most striking features about both vehicles was the presence in the middle of the beautifully appointed dashboard of a small video display which served as the nerve center for the car. It controlled  the stereo, AC, and also served as a GPS/CD- ROM based navigation system. It was super cool to drive around the narrow streets of our town and watch the digital map track our moves. Remember &#150 this was over 10 years ago. 

If you are wondering why we didn&#146t have such cars on the road here in 1990, I can tell you that the Japanese auto industry keeps the vast majority of its car models in the home market only. For the most part, they keep the best and we get the rest. Both of these vehicles were Crowns; which is an upscale division of Toyota. I think the coupe eventually made it here in much-modified form as the Lexus SC400. The doctor who owned the clinic (as well as a BMW, Mercedes 500SL and Acura NSX) mainly drove a top-of-the-line Crown complete with full (&#147Sharper Image&#148 $3000 caliber) shiatsu roller massage systems in the seats! Well, I never got over those cars and have been waiting patiently for this matter-of-fact technology and gorgeous design to make it over here. Imagine my thrill when, while shopping for a new ride for my wonderful wife, we literally stumbled upon the 2001 Acura 3.2 CL. We were originally intending to look at an Integra as my wife wanted to cure her Volvoitis with a smaller, sportier car and the new Volvos are ridiculously overpriced. I sauntered up to a gorgeous 2001 CL in the showroom and was dumbfounded to discover a magnificent vehicle that pretty much duplicated my long lost Japanese dream car and available at a price that, considering the competition, is an amazing bargain. My wonderful wife was equally impressed and we began to consider the CL as a top contender from that moment on. We drove the car a few times, did our homework -comparing features and price w/ the competition and in the end; leased a new CL in July. 

We&#146ve had the car for a couple of months now and I can say with experience and conviction that the CL is, in every critical area &#150 simply a perfect car. I will rely more on personal impressions than quoting/comparing specifications and design aspects; which are available on many excellent websites such as Edmunds, etc. We used these extensively in doing our own research prior to our positive decision on the Acura &#150 and you should too. 

I think the CL is a gorgeous car. If you are looking for retro; look elsewhere. This is a sleek, pure, modern vehicle. Our CL is white and the overall impression is of a single white aerodynamic unit. The glass is steeply swept. There is no chrome or other ornamentation. My wonderful wife (a spoiler-hater from way back) decided that the somewhat humpy rear end looked better with the subtle spoiler and she was definitely correct. I think the spoiler is the icing on an already gorgeous cake and really makes the car. 

The interior of the CL is also gorgeous. Ours is &#147parchment&#148 leather &#150 basic black is also available. There are several subtle shades used in the dash/door vinyl creating a very attractive and interesting overall look. This is a very heavy matte material that looks and feels luxurious. The leather seats are top notch; soft but dense and rich. The wood-finish accents (some of which were an option?) really set off the rest of the understated yet elegant interior. The controls are top-of-the-line Japanese &#150 which for me says it all. The necessary switches fall effortlessly under your fingers and operate with simple assurance. Unlike most of its competition, the CL is equipped with absolutely everything required for a true luxury car experience.

The driver seat adjustment is state-of-the-art with two memories that also lock in the settings of both mirrors. These memories are linked to the key-less entry system such that 2 individual drivers have their own entry key fobs which automatically select the correct driving position/mirror set-up upon entering the car. Both seats feature 2 level heating. The driving position and seating comfort in the CL is superb. One great feature that helps make the 2-door CL a more family friendly car is an auto seat-slider that motors the seat fully forward with a single yank on the large side-mounted lever. Once the seat back is returned to its upright position, the seat slides back to its normal spot. 

The climate control system is outstanding and extremely powerful. I can tell you, with 95 degrees (and humidity) ambient, the car cools down perfectly to 70 and holds temperature within a couple of minutes. A 10 micron air filter is present to clean the air. The temp adjustment and basic controls have individual buttons while the air flow and other controls are selected as touch-screen items on the Navi display (much more on that shortly). I&#146ve had several cars w/ automatic AC systems including a Mercedes 450 and an Infinity J30 and I must say that the system on the CL is the best I&#146ve experienced. I say this because I don&#146t think I have ever been tempted to adjust the thing! Apart from kicking the temperature up or down a degree or two, this has truly behaved as a flawless automatic system. It provides perfect comfort in terms of reaching and holding the desired temperature, adjusting the flow path and fan speed. 

The moonroof on the CL is small but this is just due to the limited real estate left from the highly swept glass front and rear. I think its actually kind of sexy. The moonroof slides or tilts w/ separate buttons and a third button that closes either choice. This is a much better design than the typical single switch. 

The Bose&#150designed stereo system on the CL is absolutely outstanding and features the only 6 CD in-dash changer in my experience. This is really a wonderful, useful, and unique feature and should not be overlooked when making comparisons w/ the lesser systems out there. With the CL system you simply load 6 CDs one-by-one into the dashboard slot &#150 there is no separate unit, cartridge, magazine, etc. involved. Exchanging CDs is as easy as ejecting one and inserting another. The stereo controls are particularly well designed. A nice healthy KNOB (how old-fashioned!) controls the volume while a second healthy KNOB (will wonders never cease!) controls tuning and the necessary &#147analog&#148 functions (tone, balance, fader) - by simply pressing this knob and cycling through these functions &#150 excellent design once again. Controls for volume and station/CD track selection are also available on the steering wheel. And the sound&#133is excellent. The sound of this system is in fact typical of the entire CL package &#150 total quality with understated elegance derived from absolute state-of-the-art technology. At first listen, I was not incredibly impressed with the overall sound. It doesn&#146t shout out at you that this is the &#147ultimate car-stereo machine&#148. (Ha!) However, the more I listen to it &#150 the more variety of music I try  - the more I am very very impressed. The CL sound is absolutely smooth and rich with detail. It is noteworthy that, like in all high-end systems, the bass and treble controls make only subtle adjustments to an overall flat, spacious soundstage. The CL system represents what is often touted but I think rarely achieved &#150 a true audiophile experience in the car. 

And now, lets get to the Navigation system. I can&#146t imagine anyone not buying the Navi version of the CL. Even with all of the other outstanding features, their Navi is what makes Acura unique on the American road. If you were considering skipping this $1800 option (basically the only option on the vehicle) , I hope my description of this amazing system will convince you of its incredible performance and unprecedented utility. I honestly think that the Acura navigation system represents the most useful car option in the history of motoring since the spare tire! This system is worth every penny and having it has really changed our lives for the better. Now, there are several upscale manufacturers that offer navigation systems or dumb buttons (the ridiculous &#147OnStar&#148 system, etc). However, Acura was the first car available in the US to integrate this kind of top-end GPS/DVD system into the original design of the car and believe me it makes a difference. Also, I believe that the Navi version of the CL is currently the least expensive vehicle available with true factory navigation. The CL dashboard, like those in my Japanese dream cars, is designed around the Navi video display. The integration between the system, the other controls of the car and the stereo is complete and flawless. This is a mature system with the kinks worked out.

The Acura Navi uses a trunk-mounted data DVD, a GPS receiver and positional sensors to accurately determine the car&#146s position and heading on the planet (well, currently the 48 states). From this data, the system creates a detailed digital map image with the car&#146s position displayed (as a cute little Acura &#147A&#148) which is constantly updated and displayed on a clear, bright video touch screen. For basics: (1) you always know exactly (within a dozen feet or so!) where you are and (2) you can scroll around the map, zoom in/out to see exactly where you are going at any time (i.e on the road, in the driveway before departing, etc). It is like a virtual road map with your position constantly indicated.  Not having to fold those damn paper maps is almost worth the price of admission and the digital map is much, much more detailed than any standard state road map and about as detailed as those individual &#147book&#148 maps of urban areas. Note however that the coverage of the digital map is variable  - some states/areas have more complete coverage than others. 

Does this sound like a useful thing to always have available in your dashboard? Well, this is just the beginning. The data DVD not only contains the basic map information, it also contains information on what is &#147on&#148 the map. The address and phone number of millions of locations are there for the perusing via a sophisticated search engine. Looking for a gas station, ATM, hospital, restaurant, etc? Your Navi-equipped Acura mostly likely knows where it is. And remember &#150 it knows where YOU are&#133. Want to find the NEAREST gas station, ATM, restaurant etc.? Your Navi-equipped Acura will find it for you in a few seconds. Want to find the NEAREST gas station that is OPEN at 1AM in the middle of a unfamiliar area? Well, your Navi-equipped Acura will at least provide the phone number so you can call and check. 

This is where it gets good. Once you have selected your desired location; the system then guides you there. It will indicate the shortest route (or a route w/o toll roads, or w/o interstates or one that avoids a particular road) to that location on the map. Then as you drive, the system talks to you in a pleasant female voice via the audio system (discretely lowering the music volume if necess.) and tells you EXACTLY (down to which lane to be in) how to get there. It lets you know well in advance of turns, lane changes, ramps etc etc and clearly identifies the roads/exits etc by name. All the while, the map display also provides pop-up visual alerts w/ depictions of your upcoming turn/lane changes clearly indicated. I hope you can imagine how useful this kind of system can be. I will provide a couple of real-world examples from our past months w/ the CL. 

We have only lived in our area for about 18 months. We know our way around but not perfectly. We were out to eat away from our immediate home area and decided we wanted to visit a somewhat distant mall. We had been there before and knew where it was but were not sure how to &#148get there from here.&#148 We quickly found the shopping center on our Navi list and within a minute were being directed to the destination. Actually, this was the first time we had really relied on the Navi and I missed a turn. The Navi instantly re-routed us to an alternate route and soon we were pulling into the mall parking lot.  

The next weekend we were about 20 miles from home in a completely unfamiliar area. My wonderful wife had a craving for Red Lobster. Navi to the rescue. We entered this choice from the restaurant menu and found that one was located about 8 miles away. We selected this restaurant and the Navi politely invited me to &#147Make a U-turn as soon as possible.&#148 We headed back onto the interstate, and down a couple of exits, until instructed to pull off. There ahead on the left was our restaurant and we had a delightful lunch.

The system is not just for shopping malls and restaurants. We were recently invited to a new friend&#146s house for dinner. She provided directions, however, we of course just entered their address into the Navi. This happened to be one of the incredible Biblically-rainy nights we have been enjoying recently in NJ and visibility was about zero as we attempted to locate their poorly marked street. Even if I couldn&#146t have seen the street, the accuracy of the Navi is such that I was directed to turn prior to and then precisely at the correct corner. I almost could have gotten there without looking at the road! Hurray for the Navi! It also came in very handy on a recent trip to Hershey, PA. We were attempting to find our hotel for the first time late at night in a completely unfamiliar area. The Navi brought us effortlessly right to the door after a series of very complex directions, ramps, turn-arounds etc. 

To finish up, I&#146ll relate one story of failure. I was out and about at lunchtime and for fun just asked the Navi for restaurants sorted by distance. At the top of the list was a Blimpie located apparently less than a mile from me.  I love Blimpies but there are not many around in NJ so I was quite excited and quickly drove into the indicated shopping center. Unfortunately, there was no Blimpie at the end of the rainbow. This restaurant  must have closed since the data on the DVD was collected. However, when I drove into this shopping center I was very excited to discover a Japanese grocery store that I had heard about from friends but had never located. Well, I&#146d like to think that the Navi knew what it was doing in bringing me there to find this store but I guess it just made a mistake. As usual a computer is only as good and current as its software. A new updated DVD is apparently available every year at a modest cost. 

I will close with some final comments on the overall experience of driving the Acura. I&#146ve owned several outstanding Japanese cars including 2 of the &#147worlds-best handling&#148 late 80&#146s Preludes and the aforementioned J30. The CL driving experience is similar to both of these but with some added &#147Uuumph.&#148  Acceleration is effortless and the car drives and handles like silk. The auto transmission finds its gear with such perfection that I have yet to be tempted to switch over to the super-cool electronic &#147manual&#148 mode (with up/down shifting via the shift lever and an indash  electronic gear readout). Watching your car track through the virtual world w/ the Navi only adds to the pleasure. I did not go into the safety features of the CL as it seems like most of these are pretty similar now across this class &#150 multiple air bags incl. side, etc. Problems with the car: none that we have experienced yet. I find certain road/tire noise to be somewhat loud in the car. However, this mostly results from the fact that engine noise is essentially nonexistent. Its hard to tell if the car is running! Of course, we are just coming up on our first oil change and I will certainly post any further info on future problems or issues.

The 3.2 CL will not put BMW, Audi, Saab, etc., out of business. The &#147emperor&#146s new clothes&#148 desire for these cars is still very powerful in the American premium sports coupe market and, of course, these each have their own positive attributes. However, if you look at the reality of many of these vehicles in comparison with the Acura it becomes obvious that many of the supposed advantages (primitive rear-wheel drive, stiff handling, etc) are of course not advantages in real-world day-to-day driving at all and the real advantages of the premium Japanese cars (equal or better performance, a standard luxury feature level that is unmatched, mature high-technology systems, etc) become very obvious. After looking at the competition, I don&#146t think there is anything out there that comes even remotely close to the CL for the money and from personal experience I can tell you that this car truly fulfills every requirement, and then some, for an &#147ultimate driving machine.&#148 

It is very exciting to see vehicles like the new Acura line that more truly reflect the total Japanese car experience. This experience has for the most part been watered down and modified to supposedly better serve the American driver. A case in point is Nissan which currently sports an extremely boring but utilitarian American line-up compared to the magnificent, sexy  Fairlady Z&#146s, etc. available in Japan. Apparently we will soon see the return of the Nissan sports line in America and that is a welcome event. I&#146m just thrilled to be able to own/drive a vehicle like the 2001 CL that for a very reasonable price satisfies my desires for a true dream car. The White Ninja rules the road!

UPDATE July '03: Its with a heavy hand on the keyboard that I announce the end of the line for our CL. Lease was up last month and I followed WW as she took it for its last *sob* drive over to the Acura dealer. The White Ninja is gone. Long live the white ninja. Well, enough drama. Really just wanted to update with the final facts. Very simple, really. Did not have one minute's problem with the car. It ran beautifully under all conditions and every control/switch worked flawlessly. We would get another one of these in a minute and I would certainly recommend it as a used car at this point. Actually, WW wanted something a little different and cheaper this time around and ended up with a V6 Accord, which pretty much duplicates the basics of the CL. However, while at the dealer we looked at the new '04 Acuras. Whoa! beautiful, powerful, 6-speed manual, huge, voice-controlled Navi. Whoa! Speaking of which, to keep ouselves in the Navi realm, we got a Garmin StreetPilot which we are very pleased with and I will review in the coming weeks. I was just in Japan this year and what a change. The economy is busted, everyone is broke and cars are cheap and very small - like SmartCars, etc. - while we've got the multiple fancy Nissans, etc. Oh well.
