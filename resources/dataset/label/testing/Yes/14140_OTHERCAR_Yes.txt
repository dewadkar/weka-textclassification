            I have been interested in digital cameras for some time now, but until just recently didn�t think that they were good enough for the high prices.  A few weeks ago I purchased an Afga Smile which I quickly returned due to very low quality.  Luckily my next camera purchase was a lot better.   
I purchased the FujiFilm�s FinePix 1300 which is the retail version of the 1200.  The purchase price was $249.99 which included the camera, batteries, and a 8mb SmartMedia card.  Purchased as a promotional sale, I also got a 16mb SmartMedia card as well, which normally retails for $39.99.   

In the table below you can see the number of photos stored on a given SmartMedia card, as I said with the promo I received an 8mb and a 16mb SmartMedia card, that means that I can take roughly 37 photos at the highest 1280x960 resolution or a wonderful 253 photos in 640x480 mode with is what you would use for web images.  

So what are some of the features of this camera?  2.5x digital zoom, built in flash with 5 options (Auto, Red-Eye, Forced, Suppressed, and Slow), resolutions up to 1280x960 or 1.3megapixel, a 1.6� LCD, Self Timer, USB Connection, and much more. 

So how does the camera do?  Wonderful (check out the links at the bottom of this review to see for yourself).  The camera is easy to use, well built, and has only a few flaws.  One of the more noticeable of the flaws is the lack of a lens cover.  You will certainly want to invest in a carrying case for this camera to protect it.  The layout of the LCD in comparison to the viewfinder could be better.  When we use the viewfinder, our noses left oil on the LCD due to it�s location.   

Anyone that is looking mainly for a camera to start off with, or just to take web images will love this camera.  Those of you that want to print near print quality photos from digital will be pleased as well.  We printed off a 640x480 (the lowest resolution) using a DeskJet 712c and was pleased with the quality, it was perfect for greeting cards, etc. 

While I am sure that professional and avid photographers will most likely want to spend more to get more options, for the under $300 mark, I seriously doubt that one could top the quality of the FujiFilm�s FinePix 1300.
