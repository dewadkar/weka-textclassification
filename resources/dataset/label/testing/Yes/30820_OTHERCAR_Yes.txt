            I have owned the Olympus 340-r digital camera for about 3 months now.

I originally bought it for use with my computer, for placing ads and auctions, and for personal use.  I thought it would be neat not to have to use film or pay to get pictures developed.

As it turns out, this product has worked out great for all of these uses!  I'm really glad I bought it.  

I paid about $12.00 less on-line including delivery than the price Walmart wants for it ($290.00).

You will need an AC adapter, but I got one at Walmart that works great for about $8.00.  I much prefer this over the rechargeable batteries for downloading, etc.

I have yet to tap the potential of the software CD's included w/ it, and am looking forward to that.

Someday I want one w/ a zoom lens, but I'm very happy to have started out at this price and capability level.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the same photographic need I do.
