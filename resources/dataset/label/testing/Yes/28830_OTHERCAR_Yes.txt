            When I first purchased my DC210 digital camera, I was amazed (dismayed) at how fast it went through batteries! It seemed that I was replacing batteries every day, especially when I transferred the images over the serial cable (but that is another article). I soon learned that I was not alone. Upon scanning the Kodak bulletin board I discovered that I might have made a mistake purchasing the camera because power consumption was apparently serious problem with the Kodak cameras.  One afternoon, Kodak ran a special on their web site -4 rechargeable batteries and a charger for about $50. I was so annoyed at the thought of all the batteries I had used over the previous year of camera ownership; I decided to purchase the package. It turned out to be a GREAT decision. These batteries are a &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; for anyone with a Kodak digital camera (especially the DC210). I have been using the same 4 original batteries for over a year and they still hold a charge and last a very long time. I even use them when I take the camera with me when I go skiing. They do have a problem on very cold days (5 deg f) but other than that they are a superior buy for the money. The charger is extremely well constructed. The prongs fold into the charger which is about the size of a cigarette pack while being half the thickness. Great for sliding into your laptop case. I STRONGLY recommend the batteries and charger. By the way, I love the DC210. Since I solved the power problem, I REALLY love the camera.
