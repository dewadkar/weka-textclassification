            I received my Nikon Coolpix 990 Friday 5/12/00. WOW! This is a sweet camera. I shot 104 pictures the first weekend. I especially like how fast the thing is: fast in taking pictures, fast in reviewing pictures, fast in changing camera settings. 

My biggest reason for wanting a new digital camera was that the speed between taking pictures. The bulk of my photograph subject matter consist of my energetic 4 year old daughter. Try getting her to sit still while the camera turns on or saves the image to card. No luck. 

My other digital camera was a Ricoh RDC5000. The camera took beautiful pictures, but was basically a point and shoot. I also wanted to be able to adjust shutter speed, aperture, and use external flashes. I recorded a 12 second wait after a picture on the Ricoh. Also, the Ricoh's meter is easily fooled, and getting to the exposure compensation takes quite a bit of clicking on the menus. 

Not so with the 990. I'm still learning the controls, but I'm VERY impressed. 

The alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted for 20 pictures. I'm using 2 sets of 4 Eveready rechargeable NiCd's. The first set lasted about 50 pictures. I'm still on the second set. I've been using these batteries since December in the Ricoh. I'm expecting some NiMH to arrive this week since they last longer between recharges.
