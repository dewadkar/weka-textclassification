            If you are looking in this section then most likly you either like BMW's or are interested in getting one. So, I'll give a little guide on how I decided on the 330, and a review of the different 330 features.

I just graduated on june 8th, so I thought I should treat myself and get a new car. I first thought about the Saab 9-3 viggen, since I read alot of good reviews on it plus at the time Saab was offering a 0% APR times 5 years. I test drove the Saab and while I liked the 9-3(regular, not Viggen b/c it's so hard to find one), the turbo lag was kinda of annoying though, and the interior was quite confusing to say the least.

Then I drove by a BMW dealer and decided to go in and take a look. I ended up test driving 2 cars that day, both convertibles, a 2000 328 and a 2001 model 325. Both cars were excellent and handling, no cowl shakes compared to the saab, the 328 was noticeably faster than the 325 but the sound system in the 325 sounded much better than the 328, and the new 2001 models have glass rear window instead of plastic, the auto-one touch-top was tres cool. After I test drove both cars, the sales man gave me the bad news, they are all out of 2001 convertibles, (I didn't want the used 328), any orders would take 2 to 3 months, and no haggling on the price! But, he told me to come back the next day, b/c he had a 330 coupe and said I had to see it for myself, so I went home pretty much decided on getting a bimmer over saab but still undecided b/w convertible or coupe.

The next day, I test drove the 325 ragtop again, this time the sales man took me on a long (15min drive into the surrounding areas), lots of curves and straight roads to test acceleration, the car totally amazed me (keep in mind I drove a pathfinder before this), I was doing the curves AT the salesman's behest at 40 plus an hour, no tire squeaks. Then he showed me the newly arrived 330 coupe,(still had plastic wrappings on the seat) it was titanium silver, with tanin red leather interior, with premium package, wood trim, stepatronic trans, wood knob for the trans handle, in dash cd player, harmon kardon sound system, sports package, heated seats, xenon lights. Pretty much everything, except nav system, cd changer and headlight washer. The increase in horse power was amazing, the auto trans was so smooth and effort less esp on sports mode, the acceleration was head snapping powerful, all in all a dream. After I test drove it, he told me he would knock $1000 off the sticker price, so I jumped on it.

Here's the reason why I picked the coupe, 1)no waiting period of 2 to 3 months 2) $1000 off sticker vs, paying MSRP. 3) with the same price I get a 330 with everything, where if I got a convertible it would be 325 with the bare necessities, 4) I didn't mind the auto since I would be driveing it to center city every day for work and there would be hellish traffic at times and manual would be cumbersome. After he knocked off the $1000, I added a rear spoiler, and the BMW umbrella (yeah, don't laugh) it's pretty cool, stays next to the front passenger. Before taxes, luxury tax, and all that it was $42,000. 

About the only complaints I have so far is the 1) How BMW charges you for every little options ( the carpet was $150, yes, I'm not joking, the paint was $500, and cd player was another $200) I mean a little KIA comes with metallic paint and cd player. 2) the brakes get dirty really quick, don't I repeat do not pick the multispoke wheels, it will make cleaning them extremely painful. I have the double spoked sports wheel and even with those cleaning them takes a good 40 minutes, you will need to wash them atleast every other week.

Ok here comes the different features
Xenon lights - when I was thinking of ordering the convertible this was one of the cost cutting area I considered. Now that I have it, man, the lights kicks a#@! Can't describe it, you gotta see it, it's pure white and during the day the lens of the xenon light is larger than the reg light, makes the bimmer looks like some handsome beast with buldging eyes, very cool. Plus, with the xenon lights you get the automatic light focus, which focus the lights forward when you start the car so the light doesn't blind other drivers.

Sports package - must have. The sports suspension is a beauty. The sports seats hug you so well, no more sliding around, get ready to defy centripedal force. And, the large wheels are so cool, with the 330 if you order this package, your rear wheels are wider than the front ones. One draw back is that the performance wheels are not that great in snow, so if you live in the northeast like me, I would recommend getting snow tires.

Leather seats - call me traditional fool but I just love the smell of leather. The tanin red looks really classy with wood trim interior. If you opt for the black interior, you can have the aluminum trim which looks cool and is standard, except they smudge easily, so constant cleaning is required.

Moonroof - the moonroof is so huge, combined with the large windows on the coupe, when everything is down, it's almost like driving a convertible ( another reason I got the coupe over the convertible)

Heated seats - obviously havn't used it yet. But, given how cold philly can get the last few years, I'm glad I have them.

Power lumbar support - the memory of the power seat is awesome, now when my dad borrows my car, I don't have to spend 10 minutes trying to get comfy again, just press a button. The lumbar support is awesome, esp for me since I hurt my back fencing in college.

Auto climate control - never had one, never thougt I needed one, but after 2 weeks, I can't live without it.

Harmon Kardon speaker system - kicks royal A#$! esp compared to the 2000 models, I don't know what they did but the bass can be extremely tight, the mid range is excellent on some cd's the subwoffer in the trunk is a riot when playing sugarhill or juvenile.

Cd player - it sucks, very little features, on some cd it sounds good but others it makes the bass too boomy, feels like my speakers are rattling so I have to turn the base down, since this only happens on certain cd's and mostly radios, I think it's the cd player's fault and not the sound system. I plan to replace it with the nakamichi mb75 or mb100, both are 1din in dash cd changer capable of holding 6 cds and the best part is their lights are reddish amber just like the BMW, perfect match. If you preorder your car, I recommend saving your $200 and use that towards an aftermarket headunit like the Nak I want.

So that's it, my hands are getting tired, I hope this helped in your decision making. Remember if you get the coupe, get the spoiler, it adds so much to the car's looks, you can even add front spoiler ( the part underneath the front bumper) just go to the dealer and ask for the BMW accessory catalog. If you live anywhere near philly, and want the same deal I got, go to West German BMW and ask for Steve Graffis. Have fun with your new car, it is the BEST!!!
