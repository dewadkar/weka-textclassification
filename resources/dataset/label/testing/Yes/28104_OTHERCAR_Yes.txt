            I received this camera for Christmas this last year as a present from my parents . I hadn't had much interest in a digital to be honest , I absolutely love my regular camera and didn't see much point in a digital . However my folks were short of gift ideas so while my brother got new brakes for his truck I got a new camera . 
 
Im sure that price played a big part in my folks purchase since I hadn't asked for the camera and they didn't know how well it would go over ... I haven't priced any others to see if this one is comparable . 
 
As for a first camera it is quite nice . Taking clear shots takes some practice , many of my early tries were very blurry , as if taken on a windy day . The camera is pretty east to understand though , it helps walk you through the whole deal . Once I got my hand steadier the whole thing was a piece if cake . 
 
It is ideal for quick shots to share with friends who are far away ... I was able to share my terrible early summer sunburn with my friends who were still having snowstorms . I am able to take pictures of anything I want and send the pics to whoever I want within a few minutes . 
 
The software that came with the camera for downloading the pics and so on is also easy to understand . It is simple enough that I , who had no previous digital experience , was able to get everything under way and in use in about 1/2 hour . 
 
As a first camera this is a pretty nice little job ... Are there better ones out there ? I'm sure there are but this one more than does it's job . <br><br>
