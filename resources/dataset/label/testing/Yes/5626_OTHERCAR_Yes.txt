            After 1 year and 20,000 miles, I think I have a pretty good feel for my car in just about all driving conditions.  And I can truly say that I am still thrilled with my Vibe!  

Last summer, I bought a Neptune-blue Vibe-GT with sunroof, 16" aluminum wheels, and side-impact airbags.  (I would have liked the DVD navigation system as well, but they don't offer that option with the sunroof, and the sunroof was an absolute must).

From day-one, passers-by have given my car second looks, and total strangers ask how I like the car - I let them all know how much I love it.  My friends know I love it, too, but they know why.  After they ride in it (or drive it, if I really like them), they unanimously praise the car for its handling, comfort, and all-around "fun-ness".

Strengths of this car are numerous:

In terms of performance, the 1.8 liter VVTL-i engine (variable valve timing and lift with intelligence), co-developed by Toyota and Yamaha puts out 180-hp; that's enough to let the Vibe-GT out-run most V-6s on the freeway on-ramp.  Because the redline is 8200-RPMs, this engine can really wind out - I can top 70mph in 2nd gear when getting up to speed to merge with freeway traffic.  Once, while traveling on the Interstate, I down-shifted to 4th gear and floored it; I was still in 4th gear a few seconds later as the speedometer shot past 100mph  - about the time I chickened out of testing the car's true top speed! 

The 6-speed transmission means a lot of shifting, but if you love driving - like I do - that's a bonus.  A friend recently introduced me to heel-toe driving and double-clutching, which only amplify the thrill of driving.

Handling is amazingly crisp for a "wagon" type vehicle.  At 0.83g, the lateral acceleration is equivalent to a BMW.  And although not quite as smooth as a BMW, I have never had a CD skip, even going over a gravel road or railroad tracks.  The ride is very comfortable, even after a cross-country trip with a full cargo space.

Speaking of cargo space, this car will hold a ton of stuff!  I have fit a 55-gallon fish tank, plus tank-stand, plus accessories, and still had room for toolboxes, gym bag, rollerblades, and more.  The only thing I didn't like about the cargo area when I bought the car was the hard-plastic surfaces, a problem I quickly remedied with cut-to-fit indoor/outdoor carpet.

I could go on about the other great features (sunroof, 200-watt stereo, cool gauges, AC-plug, etc), but I don't want the reader to fall asleep before I hit the areas that could use improvement.

Weaknesses:

Low-end power is lacking.  The VVTL-i engine unleashes power like a tiger released from a cage - but only after hitting 6000 RPM.  Up until this point, acceleration picks up gradually.  The car is already faster than most V-6 sedans, but with a name like "GT", I guess I want even more.  
Three possible remedies exist, although I'm not holding my breath for Pontiac or Toyota to implement any of them any time soon, if ever: 
1) Better gearing, to allow the engine to rev up to its "sweet spot" more quickly in 1st gear, and to shift into subsequent gears closer to 6000 RPM from a red-line shift.  I also advocate making the ratio in 6th gear lower, to improve highway fuel economy.
2) Reconfigure the engine to sense demand, and lower the threshold for activating the variable valve timing/lift system, perhaps to 4500-5000 RPM under full-throttle.
3) Install a supercharger to give more power at lower RPM. A spillgate could be employed to protect the engine against over-pressures once the variable timing kicks in.

The sun-visors are too small.  If you are tall enough to sit any distance back from the steering wheel, you will discover that the visor is not long enough to cover the entire side window, a real pain when the morning/evening sun shines in from the side.

The horn is pathetic.  Not a big deal until someone drifts into your lane, and doesn't even hear you leaning on the weak horn to warn him.

The driver's seat adjusts 3-ways.  That isn't a bad thing once you get it right, but until you do, the feel is awkward.

The much-touted A/C outlet doesn't deliver much juice.  It may power a cell-phone or a PDA, but any "man's" work will put too much strain on the system and it will cut off.  It wasn't enough even for my electric drill.  Still, for small stuff, it's convenient to have.
