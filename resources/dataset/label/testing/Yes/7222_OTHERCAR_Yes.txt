                 I just purchased my Cougar in January of this year.  I didn't have a clue what I wanted.  If you read my other reviews you know that I used to own a major "hunk of junk," Pontiac Grand Am.  I really liked the Honda Accords but they were a little out of my price range.  I test drove a 4 cyl. Cougar at first and fell in love with the style but it just didn't have enough umph!  So the next day I took the 4 cyl. back they informed me that they had a gold 6 cyl. coming in the next day!  Wow!  I had to have it!  After hours of pleading to my father (who is a die hard Dodge fan) that this was the perfect one and I am getting it, he finally agreed.
     My favorite thing about my Cougar is the color, it is called sunburst gold and it is AWESOME!  I also love the way it handles, this kitty can get up and go!  The car is comfortable to me other than the cup holder situation.  There is only one in the front seat and it flips things over when you turn corners!  The price was also very reasonable.  The car was used and had 28,000 miles on it so it was priced at 14,900.  So after I traded in my "hunk of junk," it was wonderful and affordable.  
     My least favorite things about the Cougar are the humming noises it makes in the freezing Kansas weather.  It is weird it only does it when it is freezing out.  The back seat is not good when carrying passengers.  I am on the road all the time but luckily I am alone.  When riding in the back your butt sinks to the road level and your heads beats against the hatch.  Not really much of a fun ride.  
     As far as safety I will say that it is a VERY safe automobile.  I just recently hit a deer going 80 mph on the interstate.  I did not loose control at all because of the easy handling of the car.  Granted my car does not look as pretty, but it could have been much worse!  I have put a rush order into the repair shop to get my baby back in the condition she was before!
     Overall I love my Cougar and wouldn't trade it for anything.  I just rolled over 33,000 miles and she is still goin' strong.  I would not advice families to buy this specific product because of the back seat factor, but a young pup like myself, YOU GOTTA HAVE ONE!
