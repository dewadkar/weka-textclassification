            An incredibly sexy mid-size vehicle that has so many incredible features I haven't yet found them all!  The smooth ride of my new Concorde and handling in the snow are more than what I expected.  Even down to the automatic locking feature as soon as you close the car door and the &quot;dimming&quot; interior lights make you feel like you're in a luxury sedan instead of a reasonably priced &quot;American&quot; made car.

The only negative I've found is the adaptor for my cell phone does not work when the car is turned off, so I'm back to babysitting batteries.  Definitely a hassle and not difficult for them to fix.

Another wonderful extra is the huge trunk space.  And with a webbed sectional divider it allows my packages to me secured without &quot;floating&quot; all over the trunk.  Something I enjoyed in my Jeep as well and thought I was going to have to give it up.

I would definitely recommend it for the value, the large interior and would even suggest if for men who are having to give up their sports cars for the family sedan, and now you can have the best of both worlds!<br><br>
