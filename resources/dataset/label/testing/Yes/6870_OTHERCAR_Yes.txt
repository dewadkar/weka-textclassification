            The Hyundai Elantra is a good car for the money.  I know from experience.  I bought a 1999 Elantra.  The car handles exceptionally well, especially if you drive curvy or hilly terrain.  The seats are comfortable, as long as you don't have long trips to make.  The radio and heat controls are very driver friendly, and the control panel is easy to read.  Passengers may not like the location of the clock because it is not easily read from their side.  It may take a few extra minutes to defrost windows, so make sure you allot enough time for it.
The ride is fairly smooth.  The handling is nimble, yet there is a slight shake in the steering wheel when you excel to speeds above 55MPH.  But, the shaking can be fixed if it ever becomes bad enough.  There are few or no blind spots that I have been able to locate.  
The best thing about a Hyundai is its warranty.  With a 5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty you cant find a better deal.  Usually you can just take your car to the dealer and they'll have you in and out in no time.  
Hyundai makes a good, reliable car.  I would definitely buy another.<br><br>
