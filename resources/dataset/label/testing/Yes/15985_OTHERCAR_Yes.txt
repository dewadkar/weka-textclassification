            I'm not going to rehash everything already mentioned about this car, I'm just going to talk about the changes for the 2002 models.  Honda has finally changed the rear window to glass from plastic , which was the biggest complaint about this car.  Another big change is with the radio, Honda increased the power by 10 watts and added tweeter/woofers to the doors.  The sound from the radio is much improved but still alot to be desired.  One change I liked was the area around the shifter is now leather which looks much nicer and will hold up much better than the carpeting on the previous 3 years of the vehicle production.  Honda also changed the transmission making it smoother and more reliable than the older s2000's.  The new color suzuka blue is beautiful and needs to be seen to be appreciated.  The best part about all these changes is honda only raised the price by $100 on the sticker to 32840.
