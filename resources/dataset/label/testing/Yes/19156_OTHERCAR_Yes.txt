            Our son Sam was born in April and we needed a family car.  I am only 28, though, and there is no way you'll see me in a minivan or a volvo!  We bought a 99 Passat, and we love it.  The car has huge trunk space and a large back seat for Sam and all of his toys.  We drove the car from Florida to Indiana when we moved in October.  We had luggage, people and a dog, and everyone had plenty of room.

The car looks good and the engine is strong.  I wouldn't get the 4 cylinder, though, because the car is too big for the smaller engine.  The service at the VW dealerships has been adequate, although car dealerships could all get better at that.  We have now driven the car in the snow, and so far it has done fine.  VW built a tiptronic system into the car, whcih they claim is a nice option, but I never use it and think it was a waste of money.  Consumer reports rates the Passat the safest in its class, up against the Accord and Camry.  

The Passat, at $27,000, is the best car for the money.<br><br>
