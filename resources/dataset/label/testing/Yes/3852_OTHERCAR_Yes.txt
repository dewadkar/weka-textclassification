            When I first began looking for a new vehicle, price was a consideration.  Vans were not within my price range.  Trucks were too limited on passenger space.  The Mercury Tracer fit the bill.  Price, safety, passenger seating was what the Tracer wagon has afforded me.  I am now on my second Tracer wagon, and I strongly recommend this vehicle. 

The second criteria I had in buying a car was safety. Living in Minnesota requires a vehicle that can adapt to a wide variety of road and weather conditions. It is also important that one can also feel safe when venturing out in the extremes. The Tracer wagon has the ability to handle even the worst of road conditions. I have owned both the automatic and standard transmission tracer, and each one of them proved reliable, even in heavy snowfalls.

Finally, it was important that I had enough space in the car to accommodate at least five passengers at a time and have enough room to transport materials for my home remodeling projects.  The Tracer wagon is spacious enough to handle these situations.

Although the Tracer is no longer in production, buying a used Tracer wagon is a good bet.  That is, if you can locate one to buy.  Most owners, I believe, hold on to them because of the many advantages the car will offer.  <br><br>
