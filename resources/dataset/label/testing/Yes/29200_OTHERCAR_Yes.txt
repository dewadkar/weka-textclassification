            I am 16 years old and was looking to buy a new first car and after shopping around for a month or so i came to the Neon. The first thing that attracted me to the car was its price, i got my 99' sedan new for 10,000 dollars nicely loaded and with a good payment plan. I also like the new styling of the Neon i think it bring's the car into the the new millenium quite nicely and it make's it look more refined. As far as mechanics the engine is not under-powerd but it could use a more updated transmission three gears is not much for any car. Overall, it is a nice car with sporty handleing and i like it. I would highly recommend this to anyone as a good first car or for someone not making over 20,000 a year.<br><br>
