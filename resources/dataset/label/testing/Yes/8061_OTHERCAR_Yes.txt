            I am the owner of one 1990 Jeep Grand Wagoneer.  This car has a rather interesting persona because of the fact that it sports many up to date features such as power windows, air conditioning, overhead console and leather interior.  It is clear though after owning it for awhile that this is a car that Jeep took special care in maintaining its original form.  This car features a carburated motor, probably the last production car in the world to have a 2 bbl carb feeding fuel to the 5.9 liter plant.  There are no vents to remove fog/condensation from the windows on this inside.  So, if you have a wet dog in the car, you will be riding in a wood paneled greenhouse. 

However, for what this car lacks in updated features it gains ground in charm.  The car still has the 1960's look with its sculpted sheet metal and grand grille.  There is no car out there but the GW that looks good with the wood paneling.  The car looks its best when gripping the road with a white sidewall tire.  

The car is relatively inexpensive to get parts for and cheap to have worked on as many shops often times have parts for them lying around.  The car combines components from Ford and GM as well as Chrysler.  

My wife drives on a daily basis with the dog and the baby.  There is no safer car on the road at over 6500 pounds, this car can do battle in an accident with a Suburban.  It has a perfect step in height for easy entry.  You feel high enough to have a good view of the road, and there is not a blind spot to be found.  While relatively low in horsepower this car does not even blink when hitched up to a boat.  This car boast over 280 ft lbs of torque.  The three speed transmission is smooth and you never notice shifting except under hard acceleration.

The bottom line is that this car is for people who are looking for a somewhat inexpensive car to purchase that is long on character, and perhaps a bit short on status.  There is a guy in Texas who refurbishes these cars and I think that his are some of the purest classics on the road today.  Don't buy this car if you care about gas mileage or if your are like Hondas.<br><br>
