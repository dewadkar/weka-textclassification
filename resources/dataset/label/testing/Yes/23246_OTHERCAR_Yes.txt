                My favorite Mercedes which is definitely worth it to get is the AMG.  However, there were not many of these in the world.  It accelerates like no other car you will find and would beat some Ferrari's, Porches, Corvettes, etc. in a drag race.  It is very very luxurious, the seats are comfortable and also you can customize them by moving them forward, up, back etc. but there is a new feature which you can now air pressurize your seating which adds to the most comfortable car seats I've ever sat in.  This car is dynamite, you won't find any other like it in the world.


   This car handles spectacularly gripping the road like no 4-door sedan that I have ever drove.  The brakes are very responsive, and enables you to stop on a dime.  It is not available in a manual transmission but I find the 5 speed manumatic transmission to be just as fun to drive around in.  The two tone black/silver interior also adds to this great machine.  It is a little pricey but the extra dollars go a long way with the suspension, brakes, stainless steel exhaust, and overall performance of this 4 door phenom.
