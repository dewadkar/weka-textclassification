            My husband and I are both tall people, he is 6'4&quot; and I am 5'10&quot;,so we couldn't just go out and buy any old passenger car.  We alsohave two young children, so we needed room in the back to fitthem as well.  The Volkswagen Passat had enough leg room for myhusband to drive comfortably while giving my daughter room in the back--even in her carseat!  The other thing we noticed rightoff the bat, was that the Passat (and all the other VW models)have an incredible amount of headroom.Not to mention that the Volkswagen Passat drives like a high-performance sports car.  And we tried to save a little money onthe sticker price by buying a 4-cylinder turbo!  But you wouldhardly know the difference between the 4-cylinder and the 6-cylinder...believe me, we drove both.The gas mileage is wonderful, especially now with the gas prices beingso high, and the trunk is HUGE! We have already driven 36000 miles andhave had no problems whatsoever.  I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this car.  I highly recommend it to tall people (and everyoneelse).<br><br>
