            I bought this car brand new in July of 1995 because we needed a second vehicle.  This was the first car we bought brand new and we spent a lot of time and consideration in making our decision.  We looked at other automobiles comparable to the Altima and felt that this was the best car for what we needed.  I'm very happy with our decision to purchase our Nissan Altima.

What we love about the car, hmm, where should I start?  There's so many things I love about it.  The gas mileage is good, has a lot of power, the interior is spacious, not only have we had no major problems with it, we've not had any!  We also love the classic look.  
As to what I hate about the car, there's nothing that I don't like.

I recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy a new or used dependable car.  It's not only great for families but for anyone looking for a great automobile.<br><br>
