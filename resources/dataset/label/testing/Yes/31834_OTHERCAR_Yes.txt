            For me Safety and price are the 2 top priority items ,when buying a car.

I got my new Honda civic 2000 , Titanium colour on 11/11/99 . Before that I have driven in various types of rental cars ranging from a Toyota to a Buick to a GrandAM Pontiac.

So far , the performance has been satisfactory.But I wish more accessories
were built in the basic model rather than having it as optional. For
example in LX model cassette/CD players are optional .The dealer charges
more than 500$ for putting in a CD player , when from outside ( say circuit city ), i can install the same for less than 200$. 

It does not have the shock absorbing capacity of a Camry.On bumpy roads,
get ready to get rattled a bit.

Be prepared to bargain to get a good deal.My friend got the same car from a different dealer for 500$ less .

One more observation - tire width is less .So on sharp curves -while
entering highways - one has to drive slowly.Otherwise there is always a
danger of skidding and overturning.

EX has some features which LX does not have.So ,one has to compromise .
So, decide what you features you need before making a decision.
