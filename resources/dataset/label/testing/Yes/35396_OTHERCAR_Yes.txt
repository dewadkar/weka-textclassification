               I bought this vehicle in 1995 for my own, personal and business use. I take many road trips and needed to buy a car that would keep up with me throughout the years at a fairly reasonable cost. In the past five years I have traveled up and down the East coast numerous time and my 318is has proved to be a wise choice. The car has approximately 85,000 miles on it and it still runs perfectly to this day. I have kept up with the car in regard to regular maintenance, and besides that I have never had to take the car in for any major repair.
  I love many things about this car. It gets great mileage. I can travel for days without stopping at the gas station. The interior is just as attractive as the exterior. The seat warmer feature is one of my favorites on those cold, winter days. You also have personalized options in regard to heat and air conditioning. The driver and passenger get their own, separate temperature controls. There are digital, illuminated displays on the dash board which are easy to set and control. 
   The car drives like a charm. The engine simply purrs when you're driving and the acceleration power is awesome, even in the 4 cylinder model that I own. Although, on wet surfaces you have to be careful if you like to speed because of the rear wheel drive. I usually place something heavy in the trunk of my car to avoid any possible fish tailing in the winter. This car is a sport's car, and does not handle like a truck in the snow. The handling in bad weather is the only slight draw back, but it is easily remedied.
   I have the two door model and it is sometimes difficult for people to get in and out of the back-seat, but I was not purchasing this as a family car. I would suggest a four door model if you are looking to buy this BMW for family use. The car is compact and sporty all around, therefore I would not expect a high comfort level for larger individuals. I generally travel alone or with one other person sitting in the front seat, although two people of average size can fit comfortably in the back. 
     If you're looking for a reliable vehicle that will last you many years without any major maintenance work I would suggest this car. I purchased mine for a little under $30,000 and it was well worth it. The 318is model gives you the craftsmanship of a luxury car at a fraction of the cost of the other models. If you do run into any major maintenance problems, like with  any other luxury car, repairs may get expensive. I would suggest that the person buying this car has enough money to keep up with the cost of putting high octane gas in the tank and taking it in for regular maintenance at a reputable place or your local dealer. Chances are you won't get good results if you take a BMW to your local gas station for cheap maintenance work, so keep your budget in mind before buying this car. 
   Overall, this car is one the best that I have ever owned. It far surpasses the others in quality. This car is made to last for many, many years and it continues to do just that for me. Don't think that because you're buying a three series model that you're getting anything less than true BMW quality. It will turns heads with the sleek exterior and please any owner with the efficient way that it runs.
