            Before starting to read this article, I would like you to know that I'm not American and that, maybe, my English is not good. I hope you will enjoy this article, in which I'll try to expose that I really think about the Toshiba PDR-M5 digital camera.

I bought a Toshiba PDR-M5 few days ago. Why did I choose this product and not another one?
Comparing to other digital camera, the PDR-M5 presents a lot of advantages.

Indeed, for the same range of price, the resolution of the PDR-M5 is higher than other ones. The resolution is 2.1 megapixels. There are 6 different resolution modes
- At high resolution (1600 x 1200 Pixels), you have 3 different compresion rates (1/4, 1/8, 1/16). The more the compresion is low, the best the resolution is high, but the more you need memory tu store the frame.
-At basic resolution: 800 x 600 Pixels, There are also 3 different compression rates.

we can notice as well that the PDR-M5 has a 3X optical zoom and a 2X digital zoom. For this range of price, it is one of the only one that has a 3X optical zoom.

That is very interesting with the PDR-M5 is that you can do movies (.avi files). According to your memory cards (Smartmedia), you can record sequences from 2 minutes to 6 minutes. There is a micro on the PDR-M5, but I didn't try to use it (I received it 4 days ago).
A good point is that the PDR-M5 has a internal 16 Mb memory (9MB for image buffer) .

Another good point is that the PDR-M5 has a USB port to transfer your frames on your computer. The USB cable is included as well as a CD-Rom, with the software to transfer the date from your camera to your computer.

Your can connect your camera to your TV. You can thus see your photos on your TV screen. The cable is included as well. 

The most interesting point is the price. In you compare to other makes, the PDR-M5 is cheaper. Moreover there is a mail-in rebate of $100.00 for the PDR-M5 camera. It is better than other cameras from a different make that are most expensive.

In conclusion, for me, the PDR-M5 digital camera, is the best product, in his range of price. His advantages, compared to other cameras,, is his price, the fact that you can do movies and that he has a USB port (the transfer is 20 times faster than with a parallel port).

Thank you to have read this article till the end and apologize for my bad English writing.
