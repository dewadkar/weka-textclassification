            If you want a reliable (oil changes only so far), A+ on gas mileage (37 on the freeway) and stylish family subcompact (this baby has &quot;back&quot; and front looks) - this car is for you especially if you want affordable.  Low insurance rates especially with dual airbags.  It's slow going from 0-30mph but it's a capable subcompact on the highway/freeway 40mph and above.  Noisy engine at high speed; otherwise, just turn on radio and enjoy the comfy ride in front.  Not the greatest at handling corners, but it's ok - you're not in a hurry to get groceries and not paying for a BMW.  Lots of trunk space (more than Civic sedan), and good visibility.  I opted for basic stuff (AT, AC, 4 door model, am/fm/cassette) and no other costly add ons except I would ask for power door next time  - it's a drag having to manually lock all four doors.  Great colors selections; I opted for silver.  Fluids are easy to change - except I prefer to pay someone for 19.95 to change oil.  Air filter is expensive $35. Otherwise, great value for price, features and looks.<br><br>
