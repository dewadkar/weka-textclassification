            The Kodak DC-210 takes beautiful pictures.  It is easy to use, just point the camera and click the picture.  The viewing screen makes it easy to see what you are taking a picture of.  The quality of the prints are equivalent to a regular 35mm camera.  I am sorry that I didn't buy the Sony Mavica instead.  It was $200 more to get the same camera features, such as a close up lens, and a distance lens, and I didn't think the speed of loading the camera into the computer would bother me.  It can take 30 minutes for my pentium II to load a full set of images.  I consider that a major inconvenience.  I was told at the store that the Kodak took much sharper pictures and was easier to use.  If I had to do it all over, I would put out the extra $200 for the ease of using a 3.5 disk to load images.  I bought the accessory for quick loading, but it does not work with my printer.  In all it's a good camera if it could only work faster.<br><br>
