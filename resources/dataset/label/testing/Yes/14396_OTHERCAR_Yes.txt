            My Grandfather bought my Grandmother this camera for their anniversary.  When he asked if I could set it up and show them how to use it, I expected a day of misery.  Just explaining email and how to use a web browser turned out to be an all day event last year.  I put on a smile and decided it was well worth it to help bring them even further into the 21st century.

Needless to say after looking at the title, it was not near as hard as expected.  Fuji has everything pretty simply laid out.  A round knob on the back has three possible settings; set, a picture of a camera, and an arrow like you see on a VCR or tape player.  Set takes care of the basics like time and date, the picture of the camera lets you take pictures, and the play button lets you review what you've accomplished.  Gram was taking pictures in no time, deleting the ones she didn't like, and laughing about how simple it was.

Next came the part that I thought would be the hardest.  Well, I'm also impressed at how easy it was to load the pictures on the computer and print and send.  It was incredably easy to show gram how to do it thanks to the step by step instruction book and the simple software included.  

Now nothing is without its downfalls, but I couldn't find many for Gram's new camera.  To keep the price down, Pop got a camera with only digital zoom.  Optical will always give you better picture clarity, but it increases the price.  The screen on the back to view pictures and see commands such as erase and picture quality is a bit fuzzy and both of my Grandparents were squinting through the bifocals.  I have to admit that I was doing a bit of squinting myself.  This is also a tradeoff for the price.

My final take is that if you're looking for an affordable camera to take decent pictures that's easy to use, you have found it and could do much worse.
