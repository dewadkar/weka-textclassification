            I bought the 1999 Mercedes Benz ML-430 after test driving and comparing it against the other SUVs. It is just the right size for everyday commute to work. It fits perfectly in my garage and it is easy to find a parking space for it. It is not as gas guzzling as the other V8 SUVs I test drove.

I drive this car to work everyday and I love it! It is very comfortable and has a very solid feel to it. The acceleration is there when you need it. It has very good brakes that never fade. It has a small turning radius probably even smaller than other compact size cars to make those U-turns easier to handle. Air conditioning and climate control is good and powerful even in the peak of summer.<br><br>
