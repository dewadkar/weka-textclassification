                          This car may not look so good, since it is by Acura and not Lexus, but who cares. This is an excellent car. I clean it every time I can. This car may seem just like the Honda Accord, but there are major differences. The engines better, it has much more class and luxury, and it is just a better car over all. This even beat out the Lexus ES300. This car is a great buy with excellent driving. The GPS system option is also a great buy. I found it very helpfull. Still, this car is not as classy as the Mercedes C-class or the BMW 3-series, but it is a good car which will keep you happy.
               If you like new, sleek and not so expensive cars, this is the one you should definitly get. If you want full luxury, big boxy Mercedes, don't think about this car.
