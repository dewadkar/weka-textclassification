            I was looking for an economic commuter car and was ready to buy
a Honda Civic or a Corolla. We went to the Toyota dealer to drive the Corolla and and the salesman had us also drive the echo.
I admit the looks didn't especially appeal to me, but
after the test drive I really liked this little car. We had three adults and two kids in the car and were not cramped one bit. The car is really
quite fast and fun to drive. Quality wise it is typical Toyota, and
is put together like a watch. Aside from having incredible interior room
for a small car, it also has tremendous storage and a huge trunk.
Fuel economy is great. I get 34 mpg in 100% stop and go city driving and
the best thing about the economy is that power isn't compromised a bit.
I also love the center dashboard, this has been criticized a lot, but
not by anyone who has driven the vehicle for a while.
I bought mine for just over $11,000 dollars with air,power steering,
and a nice radio. 
This is a great car for those looking for something economical without
sacrificing comfort,power, and driving fun. This probably would not be a good choice for those who like their cars loaded.
