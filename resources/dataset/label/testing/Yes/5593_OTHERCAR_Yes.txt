            The arrival of the Spring season will find most of us spending a lot of time outdoors.  Now is the time to go shopping for the right camera to capture unforgettable and captivating moments.  No two days will ever be the same.  Some of the precious moments will happen only once. For example, the flight of a dozens of long-necked cranes circling above an open field where they congregate almost every morning before heading to their feeding area.  Fortunately, I had my digital camera with me that morning.  I took their pictures and sent it to a friend of mine leaving in Boston.  If you want to make high-quality images, you should invest in a high-end camera such as <b>the Olympus C-750 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera</b>.  You will be able to take pictures either in manual or automatic modes.  What's sure is that your digital pictures will come out great.  The following review is about my use of the camera in some of the work-related situations.

<b>You will fall in love with the features of the Olympus</b>

There is no doubt that when you buy an Olympus camera, you will get its best innovation in terms of bundled features.  Olympus is a huge name in the film-based and digital photography.  If Sony is ahead, it is not by much.  With its constant release of products designed to meet the needs of professional photographers and mere occasional enthusiasts, Olympus is geared toward creating a niche of customers who will get back for more.  After I tried the Olympus C-750 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera, I came out a huge convert.  

<i>What to look for in the Olympus c-750 Ultra Zoom?</i>

What's clear is that with the placement of the Ultra Zoom on its cameras, Olympus is ready to invite to use much more zoom power than you would ever think of using.  If we look back at the C720 Ultra Zoom, we can see it offers 24x power while the C730 came equipped with 30x total (10x optical, 3x digital boost).  It's true that with C750 Ultra Zoom, the optical zoom in this digital camera is just like zooming in a film camera.  Understand that it is a feature of the lens, such that the image quality, or resolution is preserved when you zoom.  To a large extent, that's what differentiates this camera from those digital cameras that offer lots of digital zoom.  In fact, cheaper cameras will give you lots of digital zoom.  A model such as the C-750 will give lots of optical zoom (an equivalent of 10x).  

If the C-730 digicam was the first Olympus camera that was able to read its new xD-Picture Card, the C-750 camera is reaping from its pioneering travail.  The C-750 Ultra Zoom digital camera takes advantage of its increased memory capacity and decreased size.  At least, that's what the company is claiming.

<b>Shutter Lag</b>

This Olympus C-750 lags less than a second before taking the next picture.  I had no problems taking pictures of a tractor operator leveling a track where a farming well was located.  I had no problems taking various shots of hummingbirds int our back yard.  Keep in mind that this camera has these great, selectable scene program modes and advanced color management options which include Portrait, Landscape-portrait, night scene, self-portrait mode and sports.  What I love about the C-750 is the fact it can be operated in Full Auto as well as Aperture, shutter, and manual modes.  It will be up to your needs of the moment.  Besides various other innovations, you will find the Olympus features of TruePic Technology, advanced Olympus optics, QuickTime, flash, LCD monitor, movie recording, removable storage, video output etc.  With such an efficient package, all you can do is to let your imagination run wild.  Express your creative freedom with this camera.

Keep in mind that the LCD size is 1.5; image format:  JPEG

The kit of the C-750 contains the 16MB xD-Picture Card, the USB and A/V cables, a lithium battery, software and wrist strap.  It should not take long to install the software, download the pictures and upload them in e-mails to your friends and family members living all over the country.  As in my case, more and more companies are making these neat little gadgets available to their employees to use in the field.  Gathering information that may turn out to be invaluable to the company can be done with the right digital camera.  It's not only the IS or IT guys who can have access to them.  Employers can set policies regarding their use in the company.   In the case of the real estate, for example, you can get updates of your home, pets and projects while you are enjoying the breeze on a beach in the Caribbean, Cancun and the Riviera.  Why not after all?

The Olympus C-750 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera is the camera you can have on the road, at home, at the office and on the long journey to the Amazon if you choose to do that.

With its cutting-edge technology, the Olympus C-750 Ultra Zoom Digital Camera is a camera you can invest in.
