            This is a great all-around truck.  Perfect for hauling/towing; performs with ease. I towed 1 ton of sod in the bed with no problem, 3 times!!  The seats are comfortable for long rides, the inside is roomy for a regular cab.  There is plenty of room behind the seats for storage.  There are storage bins behind the seats that are removable.  Put in 4X4 in the snow for an easy start.  The truck is heavy enough to not slide around in the snow with the 4-wheel drive on. The radio has had problems with the display not working (something that seems to happen with the Ford Trucks of this year.)  The truck eats gas (about 10-11 mpg), but it's a truck.  Little problems with regular maintenance.  Drives/rides better with a bigger tire.  Perfect truck!  Would buy one again. Price is worth it!!
