             working for a news paper I found myself using the companies digital camera often, I loved it,so I decided that I wanted one for myself,me being.... cheap figured that a $99.00 camera would work just as good.NOT.
I returned it and sulked for a few weeks because I didn't have the cash to get a good digital,to my surprise my husband got me a polaroid pdc700. for my birthday.I love it, it works just as good as the much more expensive one that I use at work, I love the screen on the back so that I can see the picture and decide if it's good or if I should take another,it's easy to download onto your computer and the pictures turn out so incredibly clear,and to top it all off, the price is reasonable, I would recommend this camera to anyone who is in the market for a digital.<br><br>
