            I bought by 2002 Kia Sportage in 2001 because of it's awesome price, advertised warranty, and for how cool it looked. Now in January 2004 have approx. 85,000.00 kms on it and I have found that owning my Sportage has been a very painful relationship. I have many good things to say about the vehicle itself but nothing good to say about the after service. Not a single thing was actually covered through my warranty and I am now suing Kia for the costs to repair everything that should have been covered under that warranty. A brief overview of what went wrong with my vehicle is 1. Both sunvisor mirror covers broke within 3 months, 2. Both front and back Cup holders broke within 6 months, 3. Both rear windows stopped working within 6 months, 4. In winter time the doors would lock and unlock by themselves when I was driving, 5. Both front struts were leaking and the mechanic I took it too made a clear point of saying that "weeping" is normal, but these were outright leaking within the first 6 months, 6. Rear spare tire arm keeps freezing in winter and has to be taken to a garage to be thawed and greased before it will open, 7. the tires that came with the vehicle did not last 10,000 kms., 8. Rear seat fell of it's track and could have had potentially fatal results had we been in a collision before it happened and was repaired, 9. Rear wiper stopped working after less than 2 weeks, 10. Heater fan is extremely noisy now after the first winter, and last but not least, if you live in a snowy area, expect snow to come flying in the windshield defrost vents for the first 20-30 minutes after you start it. After all this, I have to say that I still love my vehicle. Having had the annoyances fixed, it's really a great vehicle with excellent power and reliability. I ran into a large deer this past summer and although the damage was expensive to repair, I was VERY impressed with how well the little truck held up in the battle and the fact that it was still very much drivable.

Would I recommend buying one? Absolutely! But make sure you get all the promises in writing so can sue the pants off of Kia if you need to.
