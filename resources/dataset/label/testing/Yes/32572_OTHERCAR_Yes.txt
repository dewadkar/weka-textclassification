            In a nutshell....I love my little red Saturn!!!  Recently when my minivan (yes, I said minivan) basically blew up, my husband and I found ourselves in the not so fun situation of having to get another vehicle!  I hate, and I can't stress this enough, HATE car shopping!!! I always feel as though vultures (car salesmen) are picking us apart!

In this case, I was pleasantly surprised!!! Upon deciding I was ready to give up the domestic goddess image and not go for another minivan, we went to check out (among others) the local Saturn dealership!  WOW!!! 

The salesmen were great and for a change we got to get a car within our price range without playing games! (ie: Let me go check with my manager on that) We settled fairly easily on a little four door red 1997 (used, but barely)Saturn!  After test driving it for a day, we couldn't wait to sign the papers and make it ours!

It is a fairly small but remarkably comfortable car!  It has all the fun stuff without the giant options costs! It has power windows, door locks, and a child safety door feature in which the children cannot open the doors from the inside at all (locked or unlocked)!  This vehicle is as safe as you can get for a family car!  A baby carseat fits comfortably in the back and there are three seatbelts for the back seat!  

I love the way the car drives, and my neighbor who is a &quot;body-man&quot; says the Saturn is one of the few cars these days that seem to hold up pretty well in an accident!  

As far as the engine/motor stuff...I am clueless so I can't really offer you any info there.  However, my husband seems to think all is well and the car runs great!  The gas mileage is awesome too...25-27 miles to the  gallon so far! 

The main plus for me is the customer service we received upon buying the car, and the continuing great service we still get!!!  Saturn dealerships offer any Saturn owners a free carwash anytime they are in the area of any Saturn dealer!  Yes, you can just drive your Saturn in anytime and get it washed for free!!  They have also called us a few times just to make sure is going well with our new (and no its not really new)Saturn!  I just couldn't believe my ears the first time the customer service dept. left us a message...I have never been treated so good by a car dealer!! This in itself makes a big difference to me!!

I would and do recommend this car to anyone...young, single, family oriented, older...this car is great for just about anyone!!!!!  Not only is it &quot;cute&quot; but runs and rides great also!!  If you ask me I'll tell you every time....our Saturn is out of this world!!!!
