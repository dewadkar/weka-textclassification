            I purchased this car as the 2002 models were hitting the show room floor.  I have owned a variety of cars including American (Buick, Mercury Cougar, Olds station wagon, Plymouths), European (MG-B, Jaguar XJ6, Volvo 240, Volkswagens) and Japanese (Hondas, Infiniti J30, and Toyota Camry).  I traded a '96 Camry, a throughly competent and Americanized car.  I wanted something that was more fun to drive, but as reliable as the J30 & Camry.  I narrowed my choices to the Volvo S-60, Saab 93 and Acura CL.  I did not consider the S model as the leftover model was a brilliant red-- bait for police and state troopers.  I also believed the smaller engine had plenty of power for this car.  On hilly, curvy roads the car can be driven as hard as my usual passenger (wife) will tolerate.  This performance falls far short of a true sports coupe (BMW-3 series), but vastly superior to the Camry.  I would like to see a tighter turning radius, and a stick shift (now available on the '02 S model).  The engine is smooth and normally quite.  On hard acceleration it sounds like a motorcycle (Honda's heritage), but that's fine with me.  The interior, other than the somewhat awkward drivers position, is attractive and comfortable. The seating problem, typical of cars with center consoles, forces you to angle your right leg to the left (especially braking), which may cause some hip pain.  The bolsters, for average size folks keep you in your seat on hard curves.  The heated seats are nice, but there are no dual controls.  The Bose system will please all but the true audiophile (who will look in vain for more bass).  The ride is firm compared to the Camry, but not jarring (unlike Volvo 240).  While you see other CL's on the road, you won't try to get in someone else's car as often as you would with a Camry of Lexus ES300.
