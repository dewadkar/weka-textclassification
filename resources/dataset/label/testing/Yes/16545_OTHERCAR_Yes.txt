            I had a 1992 240sx that I financed for $11,000 in 1995. It was grey with grey interior. The whole car was immaculate. Everything was power and it was a 5 speed and went very fast. The gas mileage was decent and the car itself was very sporty looking. It was an affordable sports car. I originally wanted a 300zx and have already had two 280zx's but the 300zx was a little out of my price range. At the time the 240sx was perfect for my needs. I never had any maintenance problems other than changing the oil or basic maintenance. It was great for summer weather and dry days but it didn't handle so well on rainy days and tended to hydroplane at very high speeds. But other than that if I had the chance I definitely buy another one.<br><br>
