            After a year playing with cheap pocket digitals, my first impression of the DC-4800 was "how do you pick it up without smudging something".  A protruding lens barrel in front, LCD on back, and status LDC on top make it tough, compared to my previous cameras, to grab and pop in my pocket.

But after shooting my first pictures I don't care. The quality of the images is outstanding both indoors and out. The color jumps out at you, and with 3.1 megapixels to play with, cropping and scaling pictures to get "that perfect shot" is easy.

While you can shoot in full automatic, you can also control any aspect of the camera. My kids operate at 200+ mph, and taking pictures without blurring is easy with the shutter control.  When they finally crash at the end of the day, the outstanding light sensitivity of the DC 4800 lets me take indoor "cuddling up to teddy bear" pictures without disturbing them with a flash.

The camera "feels" like a quality product and its reassuring to have Kodak support behind you.  I had some problems with the install of the software on my Windows ME machine...a download of the latest software from Kodak, and I was off and running.

Keep in mind, this is a re-programmable camera. The ability to upgrade the firmware is a very important detail. I upgraded my new camera already...a 5 minute process that was simple and problem free.  When the new "JPEG" standards come out in the next year, I would expect Kodak to release firmware support for the new "wavelet" compression...even higher compression with very little loss of resolution.
