            This car is nice and fast. It handles moderately well (not nearly as well as a 328, for instance, but much better than my '96 Saturn!) It's pretty good for tall people (I'm 6 ft). I'd recommend the comfort seats as the sport seats are a little stressful on long drives. Xenon lights are awesome--they do a much better job than halogens. I wasn't expecting to like them. I hate the steering wheel. I wish there were a 2-spoke wheel I could get, but alas. The clutch is a bit weak as I burned mine out in 2000 miles while learning on it. Oh, and the sun visors suck. Don't tug on them. But, damn it's fast. Get the heated seats. The nav system isn't the greatest, but it's a million times better than the on-board computer interface when you don't have it.<br><br>
