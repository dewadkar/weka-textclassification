            I helped a friend of mine shop for one of these new Yukon vehicles.  I don't want you to believe that I am on the market for a new vehicle.  I should correct myself immediately.  One never knows when a good deal will fall onto one's laps.  But I can't resist seeing or taking a second look a new vehicle, an SUV.  This is why I just hopped on the opportunity to test drive and consequently influence somebody.  I know a good sturdy truck when I see one.  My friend knows this.  That's why he asked for some advice.  So I accompanied him to the local dealership.  

I will share with you the fruit of my research.  In case you are familiar with the two-door GMC Yukon, you will find out that the Denali is very roomy.  If you have a large family, you will be able to fit them all in it.  The 2000 Denali comes with lots of features which will leave you in awe.  For example, you will have leather heated seats which come in Stone Gray and Canyon.  When it comes to safety, the vehicle is equipped with drive and front passenger Next Generation air bags, front and rear height-adjustable shoulder belts, center seating position lap belts.  What else do you want to know about this monster truck?

I don't think you want to invest up to 41,000.00 into a vehicle without having some type of in-built protection or theft devices.  While it has a remote keyless entry, the Denali is all loaded with a passlock theft deterrent device, panic alarm button and OnStar Communications.  This vehicle will take care of you while you sit behind its wheels.  Let's imagine you get lost for an instant.  This not uncommon as you get to travel out of town on many occasions.  The OnStar Communications allow you to find your way when you do get lost.  Do you want to know where you can rest, have lunch or the nearest businesses in the vicinity?  Everything is at your fingertips.

Here is some extra info you may want to have:  

Engine Vortec 5700 with 5.7L V8

Drive Type:  4WD and Body Style:  4 Door (Just picture the 2Door Yukon and realize how much space you will have in here)  

Fuel tank:  29.5 gallons

Transmission Electronic 4 speed automatic with overdrive.

Check your local dealership for a 2000 GMC Yukon.  You won't miss out on any hot vacation destination.  Bon voyage, mes amis!
