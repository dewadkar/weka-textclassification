            Past generation Integra's deserve some mention too!  Not as refined in design as the new Integras, the 91 Acura Integra GS is the perfect car if you are looking for a non-descript well-built car for $5000 to $7000.  

Pros:
1) Dependable: After 82k, I have only visited the mechanic twice last years - once for tune up, and once for broken belt.
2) Great views all around from the cabin - all windows are huge and make parallel parking a breeze.  The front window slopes up pretty close to the driver's head, offering plenty of unobstructed view.
3) The car sits low, low, low to the ground, driving feels much much faster than the actual speed.  This is enhanced by the great view out as mentioned above.  But get ready for your front passenger to ask you to slow down, even if you're below or at the speed limits.
4) Engine does not purr, it SCREAMS and is very responsive to the throttle.
5) Steering &amp; Handling is pure.  Never feel out of control.
6) All instruments are comfortably and logically laid out. 
7) Overall quality - solidly built from inside out.

Cons:
1) Road noise increases with speed - hard to talk with passengers if speed exceeds 75mph.
2) Stiff suspension - feels every pothole on the road.
3) Low car is not forgiving for aching back.
4) Front defrost works slow because of large and angled front window, which also gets fogged up easily during cold nights.
5) Since front window is big, you'll find yourself using the sun visor alot when driving toward the sun.
6) Trunk space is wide but very shallow.  If transporting a 27 inch TV, be sure to take it out of the box first.  
7) Absolutely no cup holders.  The space between the brake and front seats fit  most fast food cups.
8) Like most Japanese  cars, there are way too many on the Californian road.  You'll never feel like you're driving an unique car when you are passing one all the time.
9)  The radio is a bit low and requires some reaching to get to.

Overall, the car is fun to drive, especially for local trips with smooth roads.
