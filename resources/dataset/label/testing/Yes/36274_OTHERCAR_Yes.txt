            This is our second Toyota Corolla we bought.  The other one had 80,000 miles and was in perfect working condition.  We exchanged it for a newer version because the new one has side impact bags.  That was a great safety feature.  If not for that we would still be driving the original one.

The car has never been in the shop for anything other than oil changes and maintenance.  It always ran well in the winter and handles well on the road.  

There are 2 bad designs on the inside though.  ( Which really isn't bad considering the great track record of its performance.)
The middle hand rest is so low and back, you can't lean your right arm on it.  The driver's side seat belt doesn't go up enough when you take it off and leave the car.  It sometimes is sticking out and when you try to close the door it gets stuck.
