            My husband bought me a 1999 Supercharged Grand Prix GTP for Mother's Day this year. I fell in love with this car at first sight.  When my husband and I test drove this car, he didn't really like it because of the interior but everything else was OK.  I personally thought this car was the bomb, as my kids would say.  

The responsiveness of this car is superb.  It handles straightaways like a dream and the extra wide body makes cornering much easier and safer.  It is a real road hugger.  The Supercharged engine has enough capability to make starting and manuevering through traffic easy.  Another feature I enjoy is the &quot;oil life&quot; digital system.  This registers the viscosity of your oil and tells you when to change it. This digital display also tells range left on fuel in tank, average mile per gallon, and gallons consumed.

The thing I dislike about this car is too much power too easily.  If you tend to be heavy footed, like me, I find myself applying too much throttle and I know this puts a lot of torque on the shaft.  It also tends to make the car fishtail at first so if you are not careful I feel this car could get away from you.  My husband says I am Mario Andretti Jr.  Oh well.....

For an all around family car, this is a good selection, also.  It seats four comfortably with plenty of leg room while still having enough sporty look for the car buff in the family.    <br><br>
