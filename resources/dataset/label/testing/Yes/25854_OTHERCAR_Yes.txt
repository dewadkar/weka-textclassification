            I bought this vehicle because I needed something to help me get around my country and a car big enough to help transport my children.  I have had my Jeep for 10 years now and it is the best buy I have ever made.  I have 4 wheel drive and for those of your who like the outdoors, this car is very useful.  Although it has had its problems like many cars do, this is a great car for a very affordable price. <br><br>
