            When we were due with our first child, we knew we needed a bigger and better vehicle...we chose to lease a 1999 Rodeo and the journey has been fabulous since then!!!  Leasing provided us the opportunity to get more for our money, and since we don't drive far from home the mileage was reasonable (12,000 per year).  Our Rodeo easily fits an infant seat, luggage, and 4 dogs in the back!!!The power package and keyless entry was a definite choice and our cost for 4 years was less than $300 a month!!!  The only problem is we'll have to give it up after the lease...next time...I'm buying for keeps!!!<br><br>
