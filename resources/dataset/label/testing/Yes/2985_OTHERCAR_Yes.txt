            I am 35 years old male, I've been driving jeeps on and off from the age of 15, for over 15 of the 20 years that I have been driving jeeps.

I've owned, three CJ7 Renagade, 1 CJ8 Scrambler and 1 Jeep Wrangler. 

The Jeep Wrangler was by far the best handling on the road of all the jeeps. 

I bought this Wrangle when my CJ7 was costing me more to repair than I want to talk about. I loved the way that it handled on and off road this Jeep was a very stable platform from which I put through the paces of on and off road driving, I did things with this vehicle that I would not have done with the CJ7. But unfortunately I had to give up this vehicle for financial reasons.

I would give anything to own another Jeep Wrangler but on a Firefighters salary and 4 kids I am stuck with an older CJ7. 

I feel that the this Jeep Wrangler is made for the outdoor type person, and that if you don't like the elements you should stay out of it.<br><br>
