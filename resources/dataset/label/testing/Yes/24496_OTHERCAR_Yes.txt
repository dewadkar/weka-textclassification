            I purchased this camera last week for my Spain vacation next week.  I haven't been able to play with all the features of the camera yet, but it's a great camera.  I have taken outdoor pictures, indoor pictures, and low-light pictures.  The camera took great photos in all 3 categories.  I expected great indoor and outdoor photos 'cause of the reviews I have read.  However, for low-light photos, I didn't know what to expect.  To my surprise the camera took great photos in low-light that surpassed my expectations.  For the low-light situation I was taking pictures of my sleeping dogs in a room illuminated only by a small TV.  I printed the pictures I have taken on a HP photosmart 1000 (also recently purchased) without any photo enhancements.  Although I know that the photos would look better with alittle enhancement, it was not needed since the photos as they are taken are GREAT.  The camera is rated at 3.3 megapixels.  Another great thing about the camera is the storage capacity.  I can take 80 pictures at a resolution of 3.3 megapixels.  Hmmm...makes me think...why would anyone take pictures at a lower resolution if you could store 80 high res pictures.

There are a few cons to the camera though.  First, the most obvious is the price.  It retails at $1000.   Second, the size and weight.  The camera is much bigger than most other digital cameras on the market.  Third, there seems to be a slight delay between photos.  However, once you get past these negatives and see the ability to store 80 or more high resolution pictures, you'll forget that they are there.  The size and weight really concerned me when I first opened the camera.  However, just after 30 minutes of taken pictures, I forgot about it.
