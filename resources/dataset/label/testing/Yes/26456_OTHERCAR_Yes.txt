My wife and I were looking for a new vehicle for our 25th Anniversary. We had seriously looked at a Cadillac Catera, Pontiac Grand Prix, Explorer, as well as the Bonneville.  Both our eldest son and myself are 6 foot 4 inches tall and large built.  Therefore we wanted a full-size family car which could seat 5 -6 people, with lots of leg and head room, comfortable riding and a few luxuries such as leather seats, CD player, heads-up display system, etc. 
  
My wife fell in love with the Cadillac and the Bonneville.  We had driven a Grand Prix before and my wife really loved the sportiness and ease in handling of the Pontiac. The Cadillac Catera and the Bonneville were similarly priced.  I researched both vehicles on the Internet and discovered that Pontiac had several substantial rebates where Cadillac did not.  Also we have a GM Card which had a sizeable rebate accrued.  With both rebates we ended up paying about $4000.00 less for the Bonneville.

We really enjoy the ease in handling, comfortable ride and head-up display system.  We hate having to wash the trim as dirt has a tendency to cling to the beautiful molding.  You have to use a fine brush to clean the molding well.

Anyone looking for a family size, sporty handling, luxury car with a less than luxury price tag should consider purchasing the Pontiac Bonneville.<br><br>
