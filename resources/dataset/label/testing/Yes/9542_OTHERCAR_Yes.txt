            The 2000 Celica is a brand new Celica, completely redesigned from the past years.  The 2000 Mustang is basically the same as the 99 model which was redesigned that year.  Both of these vehicles are similar in several aspects; in this review, I will attempt to bring some side by side comparisons in each of these vehicles.  I own a 2000 Mustang V6 convertible and my girlfriend has a 2000 Celica, so I definitely do have sufficient personal experience with both these vehicles.

<b>Performance</b>
Well, first let's look at the engine specs.  The Celica GT has a 1.8 liter inline-4 engine which produces 140 horsepower.  If you went with the GT-S, then you will get yourself an engine with 180 horsepower, but in this review, let's focus on just the GT.  The V6 Mustang has a bigger engine with a 3.8 liter V6 engine which produces 190 horsepower.  My girlfriend and I have raced several times and I have beat her each time; not by too much however.  Therefore, the acceleration in these cars are not too distant, but the Mustang is definitely ahead.

<b>Handling and Suspension</b>
Probably the Celica's best characteristic, the car can definitely handle, whereas the Mustang can definitely not.  When I drive my girlfriend's car, I have the most fun taking corners at high speeds.  The car sits low to the ground and hugs the corners with precision.  Definitely a plus for the Celica.  The Mustang does not handle well; when you attempt to take corners at higher speeds, the car slides and skips on the ground.  Handling is probably the weakest aspect of the Mustang.  The Celica rides rather smooth and gives you a comfortable relaxing drive.  The Mustang, however, is primarily a rough ride.  You can definitely feels the bumps in the road in this car.

<b>Appearance</b>
The Celica has a completely new look this year.  Many people love the new look while some people hate it.  The Mustang, in my opinion looks better, and has many more options.  Bigger rims and other appearance modifications are available for the Mustang whereas the Celica upgrades are limited.  Also, you have the option for a convertible for the Mustang.

<b>Price</b>
The price range for the Celica GT is anywhere from $21,000 to $24,000.  The V6 Mustang ranges from about $16,000 to $22,000 depending on if its a coupe or convertible and other options.  In my opinion the Celica is slightly overpriced, but you can make the decision yourself.

<b>Conclusions</b>
In my opinion, I like the Mustang better, but I also own one so I may be a little biased.  Both cars are relatively inexpensive sportcars.  Although the Mustang lacks in the handling department, it has decent acceleration and definitely has the look of a mean sportscar.  I enjoy driving both cars.
