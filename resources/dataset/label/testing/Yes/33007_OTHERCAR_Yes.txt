            I am really quite satisfied with the truck except for one thing THE ROOM!  My husband and I recently(about 9 months ago) purchased a used 1999 Sierra GMC extended cab. He really wanted a truck.  This is a very stylish truck with lots of chrome accents and a bedliner.  We really needed a bigger vehicle because we had two small boys and one on the way.  Well it was definitely a bigger vehicle but not exactly the room we needed.  Don't get me wrong, the truck seats six and does have plenty of leg room.  But, when you put 5 people and two car seats it doesn't leave a lot of room for groceries. I think you can see my point.

Other than that the truck has been very reliable and so far no problems.  It had 20,000 miles when purchased and now has 55,000.  We have hauled around 8,000 lbs in the bed of the truck and pulling a U-haul behind it  in the NC mountains.  The truck pulled very well up the hills. It made my husband very proud. We have also hauled our pontoon boat several times and had no problems.

The third door does add convenience and is also child safe.  The third door will not open unless the front door is also open. The third door does have to be closed very hard or the front door will not close all the way.  

I personally love to drive the truck, it is very quiet and drives great.  I have told myself I will not get another car after having this truck. But I will get a van!  Well this is a female's point of view on this full size pick up.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a stylish full sized pick-up with a great engine and lots of power.  
Just not if you have a large family!
