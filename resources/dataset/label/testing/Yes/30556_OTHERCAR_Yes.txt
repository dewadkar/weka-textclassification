               I have a large family (myself, my wife, and six children) and we use the car often.  Everybody is comfortable and happy in the car although i regret not buying the DVD system and the leather trim. Little ones need to be in the back, the 3rd row seat definitely was not intended for teens or adults but could be utilized in a pinch.  When I test drove the car I brought my 5'7" sister-in-law and my 6'3" cousin, after convincing them to try out the 3rd row for a few minutes, cousin said he was pretty squished, sister-in-law said, "it was fine."  They did however find the 2nd row extremely comfortable. 
   There is ample cargo room even with every seat taken, but more than 2 suitcases will be roof bound.  The grocery hooks have proven to be quite a useful little accessory.  The middle console is unbelievably large, cup holders are everywhere, and the storage space throughout the car is ridiculously good.  I am absolutely in love with the steering wheel stereo controls! At night the dashboard is brilliantly lit and reminds me of an airplane cockpit, hence the name PILOT. 
   The car is only 188" in length and every time i squeeze into what i thought was a tight parking spot, I am pleasantly surprised to find one foot of room on either end.  
   Engine noise, outside city noise, and highway travel noise is virtually non-existent.  The ride is smooth, the acceleration is great, the car handles unbelievably (thank the wide wheel-base for that), and the visibility is so good you rarely have to turn your head to see whats going on around you. I had to hit the brakes hard on one occasion and they responded beautifully.
