            I sat sobbing on the phone when, in July of 1999, my &quot;other&quot; car, as it has become known amongst my friends and family, had broken down one more time and would cost me yet again another $800.00 plus to fix.  I said forget it, I'm going to buy another car, even though I'm a fairly recent college graduate and still trying to make ends meet.  Luckily, seeing as I would basically have to purchase a car in the course of one weekend, I had done some shopping earlier.  I knew that I liked the look of the Saturn and I knew that it had gotten good reviews from friends and others that my family knew.  I went on Saturday morning (my roommate had to take me seeing as I now had no car), and went test driving once again.  The sales people did try a bit to talk me into the new car.  They did try to &quot;sell&quot; me on the car.  But that's their job, right?  You just have to weed out what you don't really need to be hearing from other people.

The dealer took me out to the lot and there she was!  Shiny gold-ish 4 door (oh, well, nothing's perfect, right?).  I took her for a ride.  I returned and took another for a ride.  No, not as good.  How about this third one?  Still not as good.  So I went back and re-drove the first one and it was pure joy! Oh to drive a car and enjoy it once again.  It was like being a 16 year old experiencing the pure pleasure of driving, once again.  And it's been like that ever since.  I frequently think to myself how much I ENJOY my car: honestly enjoy it.  And I have recommended it to my father when he replaces his car.  And I will go on recommending it.  I took it to have a used car test and the mechanic's said it seemed brand new!  Wonderful!  My Saturn's a beauty.  And I hope she's with me for a long time!<br><br>
