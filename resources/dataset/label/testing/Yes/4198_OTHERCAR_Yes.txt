            First, I must tell you I was TOTALLY against purchasing a minivan.  I didn't want the &quot;image&quot; that a minivan portrays (i.e. &quot;mom on board&quot;).  We had problems with our previous car and our 1996 Grand Caravan was in the right place at the right time.  If I could do it over now, I would've purchased a minivan LONG ago!

What I love about my caravan:  Its size.  We have two young children, one large golden retriever, and the Grand Caravan is plenty big enough for all of us AND our luggage on road trips.  It maneuvers easily, the controls are easily accessible, it has decent pickup.  I also love the size doors on BOTH sides of the van.  We usually have ours set up with only the longest backseat in - it is great in rainy weather, no standing outside to juggle the kids into their carseats.  

What I don't like:  Not much, really.  I don't think there's anything I would change about it - we've been highly satisfied with everything.

I would recommend this van to any family with children.  It's great for carting the kids around, using on field trips for school, family vacations, you name it.<br><br>
