            Of course, the design hits everyone first.  It is funky to look at.  Some love it, some hate it.  I think its ugly and I love it.  When I test drove it, it handled fine.  I had a Grand Am GT, now I have  Jeep Cherokee.  Anything rides like a Mercedes compared to a Jeep.  

The Aztec handled great.  Had a little punch to it, started out quick enough.  Handled suprisingly well.  The suspension was tighter than I expected, but coming from a Jeep owner...  The cockpit and controls, as seems to be Pontiac's style, were intuitive and plentiful.  Again, compared to my Jeep, the interior was like a rocket, with every conceivable feature.  Stereo was great.  I like the feature that as you speed up, the stereo gets louder, and when you slow down, it gets quieter.  The one I drove had cassette AND CD.  There are handles made from the design of scuba knives all over.  Cup holders.  Pockets.  Places for everything.  

The cargo area is key for me.  Easily accessible.  It has a tailgate that comes down and the hatch over that.  The Jeep is one piece that lifts upward and not the easiest thing for my wife to handle.  There are even cupholders in the back end.  Not to mention controls for the CD/Stereo.  Great for the after softball game cookouts.  There is a cargo tray in the back.  It is kinda like a mini-trunk.  You can keep some essentials in it, and it holds your grocery bags still.  It is heavy duty plastic and comes out easily.  It even has wheels to help you move it around.  The entire tray slides in and out like a drawer so you don't have to climb in to reach items.  I am not getting the tray.  I tote my dalmatian around almost daily, and she won't handle the plastic &quot;floor&quot; very well I'm afraid.

The back seats are fold down and removable individually.  This is great for when we do our seemingly constant remodeling.  They say 4x8 sheets of plywood will fit.  I didn't get a chance to measure, but it looked like they would.

The spare tire is underneath and out of the way until and if you need it.  In the Jeep, it is inside, which cuts out cargo space and visibility.

I was not wild about looking through the hatch through the rear-view mirror.  The seam is like a one inch thick black stripe through the middle of your view.

Four wheel drive is not an option.  Apparently all wheel drive will be in January.  Living in western PA one might think four wheel or all wheel would be a huge plus.  But, when I think how often I put the Jeep in four wheel (about 1-2 times per winter) it really becomes a non-issue.  I am going to get traction control.  When I had it on my Grand Am, nothing stopped me.<br><br>
