            When searching for a digital camera on-line I was quickly submerged to my waist in hundreds of different brands, models, reissues and options. It was ridiculous, overwhelming enough to discourage even the most enthusiastic shopper. I didn't know very much about the digital photography revolution and the ensuing sea of specifications was disheartening.  I didn't need the most advanced, highest resolution, deepest cellular zoom lense or a camera that could eventually replace my dishwasher or girlfriend, I only needed a compact camera with decent resolution and quick, convenient transition from capture to computer and internet accessibility.

At the time I was in Birmingham, Alabama working on a work assignment that involved the Civil Rights Movement of 1960's and Martin Luther Kings Birthday was coming up. I had a digital video camera but I needed digital still capability for the march that would parade through the city center so I dove into the sea of electronic internet sites that could ship me a camera in two or three days. I was met by a huge,confusing variety. After hours of searching I found the <b>Kodak DC3400</b> and had it shipped quickly.

The first thing I notice about the DC3400 that differs from some other models, besides its clean, sleek design and compact size, is the fact that it responds to button commands very quickly. Some other digital cameras response times are off by a second or so but the DC3400 is quick to respond which definitely cuts down on "last second" photo frustration.

With 2.3 megapixels, I think the picture resolution is good enough for the average picture taker. It actually comes out pretty good for being in the lower eschelons of the megapixel world.  Pictures are crisp and translate well to the internet.  The camera comes packed in with a USB cable, a Video and Serial cable. The USB is easiest to connect to the computer and downloads nice and quick.  

The card that comes with the camera can hold 8MB's of information which roughly translates to about 65-70 pictures depending on the resolution in which you decide to capture them.   After exhausting your space on the card you can quickly dump them onto your hard drive and format the card for more picture taking.  The images are automatically loaded onto the computer in JPEG file format making it easy to port them over to the internet using an image hosting service.

The optical viewfinder is conveniently situated in the bottom left corner of the back of the camera. Although it saps the batteries, it can be used for picture taking or just reviewing purposes.  While reviewing the images are pretty clear yet when it is in viewfinder mode, it can be nauseatingly sketchy and grainy.

Built into the cameras architecture is the option to change color, resolution and a few minor/standard effects.  One drawback is the lack of a packed in A/C adapter. This must be purchase for about $30 and is definitely needed.  Also, the photo editing program that comes along with the camera software, ARCSOFT, is simple and boring at best.  The addition of a more expansive photo editing program would greatly boost the appeal of this package with a $399 pricetag.  

Overall it is a good camera.  It works quickly and takes minutes to connect to a computer.  It fits well into the hand and is compact enough not to pose a threat to convenience.
