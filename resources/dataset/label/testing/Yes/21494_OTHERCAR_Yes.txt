            I don't have the newstversion of the Grand Prix but I sure wish I did!  I love my 97 Grand Prix!  It does pretty well on gas mileage and handles the curves around these mountains wonderfully. I believe that has been the true test for me. Riding around the Blue Ridge Parkway can sometimes be a wild experience if you are in a vehicle that can't hug the curves like the Grand Prix.  My car makes it a smooth ride, though.  I still get compliments on the looks.  Actually, I took the car in for an oil change and the mechanic raved about the car. Made me feel real good!  So if anybody wonders if wider is better, the answer is yes!<br><br>
