                 ...The Maxima is a great car that drives great, is unbelievably quick, and a great overall value.  So, is this car the undisputed king of the road?  Not quite.  Rather questionable styling that can best be described as &quot;different&quot; makes this a car that you will either love or hate.

     The exterior styling is hmm... different.  The front looks great, it's aggressive, well-proportions and clean.  The back is particularly odd-shaped and resembles a Dodge Neon on steroids.  You won't mistake a Maxima for any other car, and depending to whom you talk, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing.  I personally don't care for it.

     The theme of &quot;different&quot; extends to the interior.  While most car makers on going for soft lines and smooth transition between panels,   Nissan went for strong hard lines.  Additionally, the radio sits up high and the temperature controls are situated lower.  (Nissan says that this is more ergonomically correct b/c you change the radio more than the climate control.  The car we sat in has a brushed aluminum look about it, but it was too excessive.  Again, some people make like this layout, but I feel that it has a very sharp, odd feel, as if Nissan is trying too hard to be, well, different.  Instead of feeling like I was in a snug cockpit, I felt that everything was jutting around in a cold, austere, all-gray environment that was simply not welcoming.

     In terms of driving, this car is great.  Maxima has always had a reputation for being a 4-door sports car, which I feel that most drivers will agree with.  The engine has ample 200+ horsepower that propels this relatively light car w/ no problem.  This car will accelerate faster than BMW's, Acuras, and Benz's, let alone the Accords and Camry's. without any problems.  Where this car falls behind those makes is in the handling.  Although the handling is good, it's not quite as tight as Honda engineering and doesn't communicate as much information as the German sedans.  Under normal driving conditions, you'll be fine, but pushed too it's limits, the car's weaknesses begin to show.  It's front-wheel drive, so you can get by fine in the winter w/ this car.  Although it has alot of power, it gets great gas mileage.  Look for above 30 MPG on the highway and mid-20's with normal driving.

      In terms of value, the Maxima is a great car.  With incentives and proper timing, you can get a great deal.  We almost got a fully loaded top of the line model for $26K, because the new models were due out in a little bit.  With the top of the line package, you get leather, sunroof, CD player, and everything else.  You get great amounts of trunks space and plenty of space to sit 4 and even 5 passengers.   Although it lacks the refinement of better-name cars (i.e. the leather is not the best, the rear seats aren't as comfortable as an Acura, etc...) the cars that have better quality amenities are much more expensive.

      Well, the Maxima is a great car that has incredible engineering.  However, the styling makes it very different, and most people will either love or hate it.  At the price, you won't find a better blend of size, power, and amenities.  However, if you can afford to pay a little more, I'd look to the Infiniti I30 or Acura TL as they both offer good value and a little more refinement.  If you can get over the eccentricities of this car, then you'll find the Maxima to be a great value.  <br><br>
