            I just bought a 2000 Saab 9-3 Viggen. I had a 93 Celica before, and wanted something newer that had four doors, and could cart stuff around, but was still fun to drive. This car it totally it! It comfortably carries 4 adults, it has a HUGE trunk space (even with the seat up), it has numerous safety features, as well as being considered one of the safest cars in the world, along with Volvo. It is also powered by a 2.3 liter 4-cylinder, so you still get good gas mileage. AND, it  is so fun to drive! The engine is turbocharged, and its a 5-speed manual... it drives like a Porsche. Seriously!  You can be cruising at 90 MPH at still be doing under 3000 RPMs. It handles great... the brakes are massive... and you get a real feeling of safety when you close the doors, and you hear the solid "euro" sound of them latching. You know what I mean:) 

Saab only imported 1000 of them to the US in 2000, so if you can find one, test drive it!  It will take you by storm. And it is great  to have a car that is practical, but insanely fun at the same time. Unique as well-- mine has 2 tone leather seats: charcoal, with orange inserts. It flies!!!

I can't say enough about it. Also, check ConsumerReports.org They listed the 2000 saab 9-3 as a recommended used car, and gave it high scores in the reliability chart.

Email me if you have any questions!
