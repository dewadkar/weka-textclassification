            I purchased my 1995 Jeep Wrangler S from my father for one reason - everyone should go through life driving a vehicle with an experience as big as its name. The freedom, the ruggedness, the adventure, and the attitude are as powerful as the appearance.  I have never been so excited about a vehicle since buying my first hunk-a-junk at 16 years! Having owned and/or driven many SUV vehicles through the years, this Wrangler tops the cake. Some recommendations though:  Buy the 4.0 LT. engine.  The fun is still there, but having come from a '95 Nissan Pathfinder even with its sluggish V6, the 4 Cyl. Wrangler does suffer on hills and acceleration.  Rattles, are there, but hell, it is a Jeep!!  The fuel mileage is a bit less than par, but when the mission for the day of Jeeping is fun and emotion, who cares?? Without a doubt, buy a 1995 Jeep Wrangler for these reasons................... 

1)  It is a fun &quot;weekend&quot; type vehicle that lets that inner &quot;Beavis&quot; out that each of you have inside of them.
 
2)  If you want luxury and total comfort for long trips, this may not be your deal. (but I haven't seen Durango owners having this much fun either!)

3)  1995 is the last year before Wranglers began to get &quot;pretty&quot; - go for the ruggedness - if not, mabye you should buy a mini van.
 
4)  Give yourself the vehicle you have always dreamed about that is dependable, reliable, and a good value.  Why not?  Don't be that person who wonders what owning a Jeep would be like all their life!! YOU ONLY GO AROUND ONCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>
