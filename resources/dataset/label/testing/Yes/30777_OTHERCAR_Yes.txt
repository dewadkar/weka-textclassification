            And what better way to do it than with one of the best digital cameras out there at the kind of price that a lot of people could afford.

With digital camera prices dropping like rocks, I thought it'd be a good time to check out the offerings (especially since I don't own any other camera at the moment).  So with a little research, and a little Internet magic, I decided on the Olympus D 340-R.  Now I'm glad I did.

The picture quality is great, and with a 1.3 mega-pixel resolution, you can take great pictures that can either be printed, or reduced to create great pictures for web sites and e-mail.  The colors are crisp, and the detail is better than I expected.

I like the combination of LCD and optical viewfinder.  And personally, I find that not having the menus displayed on the LCD makes for a cleaner view of the picture.  The controls are fairly simple, although I can see how some might find the icons for each button a little cryptic.  Out of the box, though, it can be up and taking photos in a matter of minutes.

On the negative side, the flash is an absolute must when taking photos indoors, which could potentially lead to problems in situations where flashes are not allowed.  And transfer speeds are relatively slow (to be expected with a serial connection).

Overall, it's a great product with an even better price.  I'd say I'll be quite happy with the pictures I'm getting with this camera for a good while to come.  Well, at least until 2 mega-pixel cameras hit the under $400 category...<br><br>
