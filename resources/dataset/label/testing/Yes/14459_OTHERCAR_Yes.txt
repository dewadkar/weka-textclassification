            I have owned my 1996 Toyota Camry for almost 3 years.  I went from the unavoidable "Beeter car" (Ford Tempo) that every teenager must suffer through to my Camry.  Although the Camry isn't exactly what a 21 year old is looking for, I found it to be a great car (it will still be around when I need a family car).  Other than the usual tune ups I haven't had a day of trouble with my car.  It has plenty of trunk space and leg space, great gas miliage and runs smooth and quiet.  The best thing that I have found personally is the fact that with mine, I can't lock my keys in the car or leave my lights on.. if it weren't for those two features I would still be sitting at the mall with a dead battery or have my nose pressed to the window looking at my keys hanging in the inition.  If you are looking for a good quality car for your family or yourself, look into purchasing a Camry.. you won't regret it!
