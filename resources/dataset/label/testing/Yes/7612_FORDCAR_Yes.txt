            Imagine, you are asleep and dreaming, it is that dream where you are driving.  You dream switches from a first person view to a third person view, and instantly you see it, that beautiful '67 Mustang that you are behind the wheel of and cruising down the road in.  As your zooming in you V8, you just can't believe that you are in this car, and then suddenly you wake up and for the next twenty years of your life, you hate yourself for not having one.  There is a simple solution.  Go out and find yourself one.  They are kinda hard to find, as I am currently noticing.  I have been looking for a blue 67 with a V8 for quite sometime now.  If anyone may know where I can find one, please let me know, my friend has one, but the guy just won't sell it, and I don't blame him.

  It is a true classic, lots of power, great looking, and tons of style inside and outside.  If you get everything vintage, then it is the most perfect car on earth.  The pony interior, the 8-track or cassette, whichever may have came with it, the classic mustang engine, what more could you want.  Many people avoid older cars because they think that they break down and don't know how to fix them.  The old mustangs were actually very easy to fix and very easy to learn how to.  The system with which the mustang works is not very complicated at all, and is very easy to figure out.  It doesn't contain all the high-tech computer junk in todays car, it is very simple, just good old American know-how.  

  This is a simple no brainer, the car has a ton of horse-power, it is beautiful, it is comfortable, and it is just the greatest car ever made.  No one in their right mind can look at a fixed-up one and tell you that they don't like it, it is impossible.  This car is what dreams are all about.  I remember from the first time when I saw the car, when I was ten, I wanted it.  I found that same exact car for sale six years later, but called a half hour too late.  I had to settle, but have been looking for one ever since.  If you have one, I am sure you love it, it could break down every five minutes, but I bet you still love it.  What is there not to love?  There is a classic mustang shop near my house, but the cars there are fixed up nice, and much too expensive for me.  

If anyone out there knows someone who ones a Mustang coupe that is a '68 or sooner, then I beg of you to consider selling it to me, I would prefer a V8, but if it is a V6, then go ahead and let me know anyways, but please, write me a commment or an email and let me know where you are, the options, and what your price is.  I would like to thank every one for reading and hopefully for letting me know in advance.  I hope that others share my passion for this great American car.<br><br>
