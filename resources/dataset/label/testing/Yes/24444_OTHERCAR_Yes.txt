            the Sony CyberShot DSC-S50 Digital Camera is a great camera, especially if this is your first digital experience. I am an old Nikon fan and the idea of buying a camera with a name of SONY on it about blew me away. However, considering, I was looking for more electronics and the best price, SONY was the best bet.
Sure enough, I found that by reading the manual, that is easy enough to follow and making sure that I got a good demo in the store, I was able to download images on my computer in less than an hour after I opened the box. And, I do not consider myself a tech heavy.
This is a great little camera. The menu on the back is easy enough to use and is large enough for even those over 50 to see readily. The different modes give the user lots of options and you may change the polarity with this camera as well, plus you can get artsy and create sepia tones and other kinds of images.
It has a zoom without moving the lens and also the zoom goes up to 6X.  The functionality really blew me away. You may do stills, mpegs, without sound, emails or macros. However, the battery was dead after taking 12 shots last night. Perhaps they were old, but, the woman in the store warned me that they really get eaten up quickly.
This is a light camera and fits easily in the hand without being too small or too difficult to handle.
The images are stored on a SONY Memory Stick, which comes with the camera, which is 4 mg. However, I bought one that was 16 mg, at the recommendation of the lady who sold it to me, and was glad that I did. She had purchased the camera for her kids and was very familiar with it.
My only concern is that the Memory Stick is at the end of the camera and is pushed in to snap out. I think that the little door might get stressed after many  openings. That could be a problem after much use.
I also purchased a SONY mouse to go with my laptop computer, since it has a place to insert the SONY Memory Stick and immediately downloads the images that have been captured. This is a great feature and makes for an even greater opportunity, since I do hate touch pads. I have an HP laptop and have been working to find a good mouse, and this seemed to be the perfect solution. It was an additional $49.00, but was worth it, since the HP touch pad, has given me a problem since I got this computer.
The USB cord comes with this camera and is easy to install on your machine. I was able to install mine without any issues at all. 
As an update to this Epinion, I have been completely unable to find in stores or on the Net, the AC adapter that the SONY  site says is available in my area. Since I live in an urban area with 1.25M others, I suspect these little hummers are readily UNavailable. I went back to the store where I bought the camera. The woman who was so helpful and was the department manager said that she has NEVER been able to get SONY to send them to her store. 
Also, they are unavaible on the Net. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that SONY produces their own batteries. Thus, I see this as a major drawback for the purchase of these cameras. I may go back to my beloved Nikons before I am done here. Stay tuned.
In all, I have found this to be a very easy and very useful device to have and look forward to becoming more familiar with its functionality.
