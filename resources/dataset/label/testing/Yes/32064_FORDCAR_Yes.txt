            It may never wear out.  How will I justify buying a newer unit?  It even does some things better than the newest Explorers such as:  (1) better front seats.  These are the most comfortable seats I've ever had in a vehicle.  When I die I want to have one mounted in my coffin.  (2)  Better visibility for the driver.  Something about the way the seats are mounted gives a 6' driver a better view of the road, without having to peer through the shade band across the top of the windshield.

Handling is good.  Don't expect to be able to throw it into a corner like a sports car.  The new model with independent rear suspension is clearly superior, but this one is perfectly ok.

As wonderful as the front seats are, the rear seats are very poor.  Long distance trips require frequent breaks for the back seat passengers.

Visibility is excellent.  Throw away the interior mirror and rely on the large side mirrors.  It gets rid of a front blind spot, and you'll never miss it.

Reliability has been very good.

The anti-lock brakes are excellent.  4 spd. Auto. transmission is ok.

Weaknesses which cause(d) no end of aggravation: (1)  Passenger car tires do not belong on a vehicle which goes off-highway extremely well.  Switching to Toyo light truck tires cured the propensity for punctures (4 in 50,000km including 2 on pavement) but makes for a harder and noisier ride.  It's worth it.  (2) The gutless pushrod 6 cylinder engine is a continual source of frustration.  If it got great fuel economy it would be ok, but fuel guzzling is complaint number 3.  Do not plan on towing a trailer with this vehicle.  You'll have to lock-out overdrive and put up with constant 2nd/3rd shifting at highway speeds on near-level roads with even a 2,000 lb trailer behind you.
