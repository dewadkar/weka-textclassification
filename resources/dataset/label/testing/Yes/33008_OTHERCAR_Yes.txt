This four door beauty drives and handles beautifully. It will hold 5 adult passengers with room to spare. The full back seat has plenty of leg room, and with the 4 doors it makes it easy to enter and exit the vehicle. The leather interior is soft and easy to clean.

The vehicle listed for $32,223.00 and we paid (are you ready?) $23,762.40. How did we do that? Well read on.

Since my husband is a hourly GM employee, he is entitled to purchase a GM Company Owned Vehicle. This program allows him to order a GM vehicle of his choice, which is then driven by a GM management employee for up to 7,500 miles. In order to use the program you must be a GM eligible employee. (That is the ketch) You must first visit a dealer in your area and select the make, model and options you want on your new vehicle. You then call the GM voice activated telephone system, telling them the make, model and options you want. You are then placed on a waiting list and notified by mail when the vehicle will be available. (This can take a long time. He waited 9 months). The vehicle will then come in at a dealer near you, and you then inspect the vehicle. You do have the option of refusing the vehicle and go back on a waiting list again. The vehicle has a new title and warranty. The dealer will help with financing. You can either buy or lease the vehicle. The problems with the program is you do not get to choose the color of your new vehicle. They also will not guarantee a availability date nor the mileage on the vehicle. (The more mileage the vehicle has the less you pay for the vehicle). If you are in a hurry for a new vehicle this is not the way to go. Like I said before, it took us 9 months to get the vehicle.

Even with the wait, this is the truck for us. We are very happy with our new truck. As for problems with the truck, we have none yet.
