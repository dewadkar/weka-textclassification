            <b>I purchased a Polaroid Digital PDC-640.</b>

Do I love it to death? <b>Ohhh Yesss.</b>

I can take pictures of moving objects and stop them as if they were standing still!

A good example of this is I have taken pictures of my ceiling fan ( I know odd huh?) But it was able to stop the fan clear as day and it showed me how much dust I had sitting up there. <b>Yuck</b>
That is a test that many cameras will not pass, no matter what kind they are!

I love nature and have the urge while driving down the road to point out the window and snap shots of clouds, animals, trees, almost anything really. 
(Don't try that one on the road kids.)

The size of the camera is a bit of a problem for me, it isnï¿½t really small but it does feel as though it wasn't made to fit snugly in your hand.

The camera has a video view window that allows you see the picture before you take it, I have no big gripe about that except for if it is really sunny your ability to see the picture is little to none. (I find myself cuffing the screen or using the viewfinder.)

I had seen that a comment was made on the software for the Polaroid PDC-640,
I agree with that person 100%. The software does offer many new features such as web site building, and digital postcards w/sound features. The actual editing window for the basic picture actions is small, way to small for me to work in. 

I have no choice but to take my photos to my scanner software for editing. 

(But I take my pictures to every program I have till I am happy anyway.)

If you plan on purchasing the Polaroid PDC-640, Buy it from a store that has a good return policy, that way you can try it out and see if it is right for you.

<b>Before you purchase a digital camera remember this piece of advice. 

&quot;Be ready to back up your photos somewhere other than your computer, and make sure you are ready to put the photo albums away! 

The cost of ink, photo paper, and eventually a CD burner may be more than you started off thinking about purchasing.&quot;</b>

If you would like to see some of my photos that I have on line, you can visit my web site located on my profile page. The PDC-640 link is a devoted page for this review.
