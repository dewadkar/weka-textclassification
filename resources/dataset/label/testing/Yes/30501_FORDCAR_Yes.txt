            My husband and I just bought a 1999 F350 Super Duty, 4x4, dually, longbed, crew cab, with the 7.3L Turbo Diesel. I must say that it's the nicest truck around! We absolutely love this truck. 

We own and operate a horse farm and have a definite need for such a powerful truck. We haul horses, hay, shavings, feed, and whatever else that needs to be hauled. Pulling a 2-horse trailer is like pulling nothing at all. We are in the process of buying a 6-horse trailer and I'm sure we'll have no problems whatsoever. 

Initially, I was kind of intimidated by such a big powerful truck(maybe since I'm 5'2&quot; and very small), but after driving it for a few days I absolutely love driving it! You sit up above almost every other vehicle on the road, and you better believe that people will move out of your way! My husband and I fight over who gets to drive! It's so easy to drive and so comfortable with a huge interior, it's the perfect road trip vehicle(except for the gas mileage)! Actually though compared to other similar vehicles the gas mileage isn't too bad. 

Anyone that has a need for a truck this size should definitely get the F350 and not the Chevy3500 or the Ram3500. It's the best looking and the best performing truck I've ever seen or driven. Anyone that doesn't have a specific need but does want the best big truck around, I'd suggest the F350 as well!!<br><br>
