            I was looking for a semi-used car back in '96, and as I was browsing through the classifieds, I came across a perfect description; &quot;94 Altima, black, standard transmission, beige interior, low miles, $10,000...&quot;

At first, I thought that it was kind of steep for a 2 year old car with low miles.  After awhile, I realized that the car I was driving at the time (an 84 chevy citation) was not going to last me anymore miles...

So, I went to the good ol' bank and asked for an auto loan, which they surprisingly approved.  I went and test drove the Altima, and it rode like a beauty.  It was so quiet and smooth.  My only gripe was that the guy put in a post-factory installed sunroof, which looked a little cheezy.

Well, I got the car with 22k miles, and two accidents (got rear-ended both times) and 45k miles later, I am still in love with my car, but I realized that I am going to need a new clutch soon 'cause it's getting really hard to shift between gears...

My most expensive purchase for the car was it's 30k mile tune-up and maintenance at a Nissan garage (what a rip!).  My second most expensive purchase for the car was buying a whole new set of Eagle HP's since my tires were going bald.

It's certainly not a sports car, so don't expect a taught suspension, and my car has a 4-cylinder engine, so there's a bit of pep, but not like the 6 clinder version.  Oh, and the walnut interior finish in my Altima is the best I've seen among all the Altimas.  I bet this car is going to last me a long time... by the time that I need to get another set of tires and a regular tune-up, I'll probably have gotten everything I needed out of this car.  I am not sure how the new Altima's drive and feel, but I like the look of the first generation more than the 2000 models...

If you are looking for a reliable car with some good interior room and easy driving at a more affordable price than the Accord, then forget buying the Honda Accord and get yourself a Nissan Altima...

Now if I can only buy some rims, some pirellis and drop it a little...<br><br>
