            I am tired of car magazines talking about how great the 300M is. Especially now that is has direct competition with the Lincoln LS- the Motor Trend Car of the Year. Lets look at the facts. The 300M and LS start at about the same price- $30,000. The one plus to the 300M is that its engine, a 3.5 liter V6 has 253 horses behind it. The V8 LS (slated to be called the LS8) makes 252. This may sound like the LS is underpowered, but this is not the case. The 300M engine is pushed to the limits. This is okay, but Chrysler isn't known for its engines. In a few years, the engine could start to show signs of wear and tear.

It is also to important to remember that the 300M is a Dodge Intrepid/Chrysler Concorde underneath. This is a good platform, but not a performance car platform. The LS is rear-wheel drive, like the BMW 5-series and other highly respected luxury performance cars. The LS shares engines and components with the Jaguar S-Type.

The LS has 50/50 weight distribution- which improves handling. It is also equipped with yaw control. This keeps the car from leaning side to side during turning. The LS also will not lean forward during heavy breaking and lean back during heavy breaking. These features may be more money, but greatly improve the ride in this car. 

The styling of the LS is much more conservative and mimics the BMW 5-series. The 300M seems to look more like a spaceship. While the 300M is somewhat attractive, is doesn't look like the kind of car a executive would drive. 

Overall, the LS is a great car, which deserves a look if you want to buy a luxury car.<br><br>
