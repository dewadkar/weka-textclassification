                 I recently purchased a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer because I needed something with 4x4.  I live in a rural area, but getting out of my driveway in the winter is the biggest problem.  I've had it since December, 11, and it's been snowing here ever since.  If I hadn't bought it, I would still be at home since the 1st 8 inches of snow we got.  It is wonderful not having to worry about how I'm going to get out of the driveway to go to work every day.  Last winter, my husband spent countless hours salting our long driveway and pulling my front wheel drive up to the top of our hill with his 4x4.  

     I drive alot for work, sometimes 150 miles a day, and was hesitant to buy a 4x4 due to the horrible gas prices.  I'm not doing bad though.  I really can't accurately tell you what kind of gas mileage I'm getting though, because I've had to put the truck in 4 wheel drive alot.  I have been averaging between 17 and 20 mpg.  Not bad for using 4 wheel drive, huh?
  
     My Blazer doesn't ride like a truck.  It feels more smooth like a car and is easier to load kids into car seats than a traditional truck.  I have the 4 door.  I have the leather seats and seem to have trouble getting the kids car seats tight though.<br><br>
