            I purchased my G 20 in 1996.  I am a real driver.  My average driving distance is over 40,000 miles per year!  My odometer now reads 114,000.  It is a little less than it should have been, due to an accident I had in September of 1997.  I was rear-ended by a teenage girl who was busy chatting with her friends while driving at 40 miles per hour!

I always wear my seatbelt, but I was amazed that the car withstood the impact while totaling the girl's car.  My car did have damage to the trunk and bumper area, but I was well-protected.  I  only sustained some minor back pain which went away after a couple of months.  The car was repaired expertly by Infiniti trained mechanics, and I had the use of a loaner car for the entire time courtesy of the Infinite dealership.  The loaner car program which Infiniti offers is outstanding; they have even given me a more expensive model to drive!

My car is going strong.  Other than replacing the battery and tires, I haven't needed to have the car repaired.  I get about 30 miles per gallon of gas.  This is based on frequent highway driving.

The standard model is loaded.  Mine has leather upholstery and a moonroof which I love.  Oddly it did not come equipped with cup holders!  The absence of those resulted in lots of stains on the carpeting from spilled drinks.

The car is fast and handles well.  The antilock brakes have prevented a few fenderbenders for certain!<br><br>
