            I picked up a 1997 Taurus SHO after looking over several &quot;sporty&quot; four door sedans.  The car is very refined for a Ford.  Almost everything in the car is improved or updated over the V6 Taurii.  It has SHO-specific engine, brakes, transmission, steering, upholstery... the list goes on.

Ford did not market the SHO very well.  They are hard to sell.  For this reason, new SHO's can be found at the dealer for thousands under MSRP.

Positives:

The car is a performer.  It is not a stoplight racer so much as it is an executive cruiser.  It has the brakes and suspension to keep up with the motor, but not at the expense of a comfortable ride.

It has been 100% reliable since the day I bought it.  It is the most trustworthy car I've ever owned.

Good ergonomics.  One could drive this car for hours on end with little driving fatigue.

Negatives:

The styling is definitely love-it-or-hate-it.  

The V8 is thirsty.  Frisky drivers can expect no better than 15 mpg in the city.

The oval-shaped stereo / climate controls make it nearly impossible to upgrade the sound system.
