            After a protracted review period of over a year and a half, and comparing it with the obvious contenders, and some not so usual suspects - the Mazda 6i 5-speed ended up being the car I chose as the perfect vehicle for me! 

Now, some 2000 miles into the ownership experience, I still love it more everyday. The incredible poise and handling grow on me, and the engine runs smoother by the day. Great features, decent option packages, amazing handling (for its class), and adequate but perfectly comfortable interior all make it feel like a more expensive car in a class above its competitors. Add to that the economy (initial cost and projected overall maintenance/reliability plus running costs) make this a great choice - but only for those who know about it! 

If you're considering a car in this class, you're probably already turned off by the pedestrian, if high-quality offerings from Toyota (Camry) and Honda (Accord), or by the unrefined and much-LESS-fun-to-drive, although admirable attempt from Nissan (Altima). Even the VW Passat's float handling characteristics, tight interior quarters and known reliability problems are well known now. So go do yourself and your pocketbook a favor, and test drive the Mazda 6. The unique fun-to-drive characteristics of this vehicle, in such a refined yet economical package - will have you hooked. It appeals to your practical as well as your visceral, wild and fun sides. 

With the available options packages, I had mine very well equipped, and absolutely love the Appearance and Premium Packages, and the MP3 Player )which is very feature rich - ID3 tag display, CD Text and a higher output level than the stock unit!) 

Mine is a 5-speed 6i - the 4 cylinder engine. I think that in the Mazda 6 line, which features Automatic AND Manual transmissions with both the engine choices (Inline 4 cylinder and V-6) - this (5 speed manual 6i) is the best combination of responsiveness, power, weight balance and handling. 

Ok - that's long enough. Time for me to go out and drive it some more now. You still there? Go on - get that test drive already!
