            Replacing my SHO is difficult, but Aurora 3.5 is the right car for the right price.  I drove 5 different Auroras.  A 3.5, two 4.0s, another 3.5, and a 4.0.  I also test drove a Lexus GS 300, Nissan Maxima, Saab 9-5 1.7 turbo (back to back with an Aurora 3.5)  Regal(junk) and a Lincoln LS.

The interior on the 2001 Aurora is first class. Leather, real wood, Ergonomic cockpit.  Especially impressive is the tactile resistance for the steering wheel switches.  One of the pair control the temp and fan speed for the cabin. The other pair allows track selection on the CD and volume. The base radio has some merit, but get the Bose upgrade if you want to drown out the cell phone.

Engine was a tough choice, but the 3.5 is practical. Real Estate sales requires some consideration of expenses.  I could not justify $4000 for 35 horsepower.  I can envision some easy modifications under $400 which could net another 5-10 horsepower on the top end. Regular gas and 19+mpg in the city make it a nice luxury buy. The savings will go toward the payment.

Unfortunately, the 17 inch wheels (a $1100 option) are not available for the 3.5.  The car loses some of its muscular looks with the 16 inch wheels.  Oldsmobile is losing income to after market wheel makers. I would have gladly paid for 17 wheels. Hello, GM revenue available.


The car is very attractive when viewed from the side or from behind the rear quarter panel. Other GM divisions should take a few styling ideas from Olds. Aztek??? Hello,is anyone home at Pontiac?

Consider the 2001 Aurora if you have to have a nice car for a great price. I liked the Maxima, but when I test drove the Maxima it needed a jump start, so did another customer's tester. It had no gas, I had to split the gas, 2 gallons, with the salesman. Nightmare.Bad Omen.

The Old's dealer's lot manager let me take one right off the car carrier. No tags, highway and everything. The Salesmanager let my wife and put 50 miles on a 4.0.


I will write a detailed driving report after Christmas. I believe roll induced understeer will be a significant issue for all owners. I will have fun learning how to correct with throttle and braking. I'm keeping my &quot;boy-racer&quot; in the next stall just in case I need a fix.
