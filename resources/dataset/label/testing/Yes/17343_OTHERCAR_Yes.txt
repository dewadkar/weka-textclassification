            Honda Accord stays true to its design and engineering history with the 2001 model.  It comes in three lines:  DX, LX and EX.  For sure, it comes with a lot of changes.  The features make the 2001 Honda Accord safer and more fun to drive.  Two weeks ago, I had to rent another vehicle because my truck had to go to the shop.  I had all the reasons in the world to get ready for the upcoming hot days and weeks.  The A/C in my Jeep had failed to work properly.  After driving the Honda for three days, I remained impressed by it.

One of the first things you will notice is that the Sedan has a new, kind of more sharply chiseled front facia and hood along with a new taillight and rear deck design.  Going to my various appointments, I had no problems getting access to the local freeways and higways.  I truly enjoyed the ergonomics that can be found in most Honda vehicles.  I revved the 2.3L 16-valve VTEC four-cylinder as in (EX V-6).  The LX is also a powerful vehicle according to the salesperson.

<b>Some of the features</b>

For a great handling and control on the freeways, the Honda Accord comes equipped with front and rear (N/A DX) stabilizer bars.  They work to provide the accord with a firm grip of the roads.  In other words, they keep you grounded.  In terms of space, you will enjoy the Sedan's trunk capacity.  It's 14.1 cu. ft.  What's more is that the rear seats are made to give you more cargo space.  Now, for the driver, you will get the best of Sedan.  Your seat can adjust 6 different ways to provide you with more comfort.  It makes sense that Honda continues to stay true to its famed history.  Its forte lies in displays, controls, and lots of space or ergonomics.

<b>Security and theft deterrents:  More important features</b>

The Sedan comes equipped with dual front airbags and engine immobilizer theft deterrent system.  As you know, safety is very important to me.  That's one of the features that I value a lot.  And that is because airbags saved my wife's and kids' lives in a side collision last year!  Any way, this Sedan has drive and passenger side airbags that can protect you and your passenger against this type of fatal accidents.  The EX that I was driving had an alarm system, remote keyless entry. If you are not interested in the EX, just know that for the LX and DX, you can have the safety equipment as an option.

Decide whether you want to go automatic or manual.  Despite that this rental had an automatic transmission, I'd rather have rented the sedan with the manual transmission.  But, my wife needed to drive it too.  She prefers the automatic.  Whatever your choice may be, you will enjoy the time in a Honda Accord!
