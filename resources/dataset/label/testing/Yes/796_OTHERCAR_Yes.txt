            I love my Integra! I have the four-door Integra GS, with the more powerful 1.8L DOHC Inline-4. This car is my first, though I did not learn on it. My family has always been a Honda family. My father has owned several, two before I was born. My mom drives the new 2002 CR-V, and my sister drives my dad's old Civic LS.
My Integra sports great acceleration. The high-end speed isn't that great, though is more than enough for interstate driving. I replaced the stock head-unit with a Sony XPLOD CD/MP3 player and the front speakers with Pioneers. The car has a great power-to-weight ratio, utilizing every horse from that four-cylinder engine. The Integra can handle corners well, and braking is comparatively well considering its only got two front disc brakes. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, I don't like the fact that the windows aren't framed at the top, but I can deal with it. I also find the suspension a little tight, which is understandable because it is so low to the ground. I was considering lowering it even more, but even without lowering it, if I go too fast, I bottom-out over speed bumps. I really like being low to the ground, makes you feel like your actually part of the car. One noticeable problem is the transmission. When slowing down, it clocks out heavily, then clocks in heavily. It feels like a surge. Overall, I recommend this car. It is quick, reliable, and sporty, and looks newer than its time.
