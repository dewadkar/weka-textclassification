            In 1996 my husband and I were once again looking for &quot;his dream truck.&quot;  We were not too lucky it seemed when it came to buying vehicles.  He saw this truck and all was said, he had to have it.  

I was concerned about him buying a small truck and a 2 wheel drive at that.  He is 6ft. 2 in. 205 lbs, so I was wondering if he would have enough room.  I was happily surprised, he loves it.

He has drove it to Texas from Kentucky and back and it performed great and it was a good ride for him, plus good on gas.  I had not been a real fan of Ford's before, but after this purchase I have a reformed opinion.

In my opinion the Ford Ranger XLT is a very wise choice and you won't be sorry, I know we are not.<br><br>
