            My family recently rented a <b>Ford Windstar</b> by accident on our recent trip to Colorado.  Due to a mistake caused by Budget Rental Cars we ended up with the Windstar and there was no problem with it by me.

I personally have always wanted a mini-van for we have a large family.  Especially with the new editions of my daughter and niece.  The cars my family do drive are not big enough for 2 car seats and everyone else to sit.  If only I could drive, I would definitely purchase the Windstar.  

I don't have much car experience, but I can say that the Windstar drives very smoothly.  The Windstar has a very spacious interior, the back seat folds down for added room when traveling or going on family outings.  There are several air conditioning vents located around the van, as well as cup holders.  The one thing I didn't like was that the windows don't open in the rear.  

Everything about the Ford Windstar deserves a gold star from me!
