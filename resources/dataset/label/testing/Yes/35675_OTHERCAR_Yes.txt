            We bought our 1994 Grand Voyager before we even had kids. It was a good decision because now that we have several, we could not afford the monthly payment.

We chose the Grand Voyager because we wanted a lot of space for driving with our dogs and taking vacations. The van is great in this respect. It is very spacious and many come with rooftop luggage racks for additional carrying room.

The van gets decent gas mileage averaging about 20 miles to the gallon. In other words, the 20 gallon tank will take the van about 400 miles. It runs nicely on just plain ole regular unleaded gasoline.

During the time we have had our van, we have received no fewer than 5 recalls. I would not classify any of these recalls as huge problems, but when you get 5 of them you begin to wonder what all they are missing. Several of the recalls became problems for our van before(and I am talking just weeks before)we received the recall notice. The liftgate latch had a problem, the airbag sensor had a problem, the electrical system had several minor problems. All recalled and fixed, but like I said, It makes you wonder about what else may crop up.

The biggest flaw in the 1994 Grand Voyager is that it has a terrible turning radius. I have to make 3 point turns for all but the roomiest U-turns. This is a pain in the neck. They fixed this problem in the 1996 Grand Voyager and it is a great improvement. 

These early minivans have only one sliding passenger door and it is very difficult to get into the back seat or get 2 or more small children into the van from that one side. A second side door is available on 1996 or later models. Also a huge improvement. The 2001 models have an option for the liftgate and side doors to close with the click of the button. I can't wait to get one of these.

All flaws aside, I think this is a decent minivan. It is the biggest in terms of practical space than any of the others. It drives just as nicely, with the exception of the turning radius, as any other minivan. There is plenty of leg and head room and the seats are roomy.

If you are in the market for a used minivan, I do recommend getting one with the rear a/c and heating system. Otherwise riding in the back is not too comfy. If you have several kids, I would recommend a later model with the double sliding doors. It makes life so much easier. 

I am on my second Grand Voyager(my newest is a 96 with the double doors)and would buy another in the future. I have spent very little on maintenance and upkeep and am pleased that Plymouth has been so accomodating in getting the recalls out to the public and fixing the items in a timely manner. I will keep buying them until I have a negative experience. So far, so good.<br><br>
