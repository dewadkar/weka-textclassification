                I purchased this camera as an upgrade to my Kodak dc25 digital camera. I find that the picture quality is a big step up from the dc25. Colors are rich and saturated, resolution clears up what used to be very digital looking edges. I am very happy with the quality of the pictures.
    The camera is a little bulky to carry and handle. The shape makes it difficult to find a small generic camera bag that will hold the camera and a few accessories. Memory cards are not cheap, but are available in different sizes and by different companies. Batteries go fast especially when using flash, included rechargables work well and seem to last as long as non-rechargables. Digital zoom feature is not user friendly,it is difficult to use digital zoom outdoors because you cannot see the LCD panel well enough in sunlight.It is not a feature or reason to purchase this model over one without digital zoom. 
    Over all I enjoy using owning this digital camera. I have taken and printed pictures, framed them and given them as gifts. The quality when combined with a good quality printer and paper rivals traditional photography, and I was a wedding photographer!  <br><br>
