            We bought our Durango (a very new 1999) for a few reasons. Living on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts USA, we need a vehicle that can stand up to every-day use on some pretty hairy dirt roads (we live on one) and cobblestone streets. We also need a vehicle that can drive on the beach, through extremely soft sand conditions. Having two young kids, and living in a place where most visitors don't bring their cars, we also need a third row of seats.

The Durango is a perfect fit for us, and an all around winner of a truck. The exterior is drop dead gorgeous, and very unique, even in a place swarming with SUV's from Lexus, Lincoln, and Mercedes. On pavement the Durango drives like a dream, silky smooth ride and very quiet. On rough roads the ride is as smooth as you could ask for, without a hint of weakness or complaint. On the beach, the Durango...is like a slice of heaven. It eats up deep sand like nothing I've ever driven, with it's very powerful V8 (I have the 5.2 litre) and its short, wide wheelbase. I only need to let about 10 pounds of air out of the tires, slip into 4wd....and I'm off. I've yet to even come close to needing the low range 4wd.

This off-road performance is complemented by  perfect size. Dodge really hits the nail on the head, when they tout the Durango as the perfect middle ground between tiny SUV's (read: RAV4, CR-V, etc) and the monsters (Suburban, Excursion, etc.) In addition, the third seat folds down easily and completely, eliminating forever the hassle of istalling and removing seats for your guests, cargo, dogs, and so on.

I LOVE this truck. If you don't mind spending the money, and you don't mind buying a lot of gas, you will too.
