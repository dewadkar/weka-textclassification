            This is a review for the Sentra XE Sport Coupe with 5-Speed.  I purchased this vehicle brand new and kept it until I was married almost two years later.  At the time, I wanted to purchase a budget minded, economical car.  This car did not disappoint.  Here are the particulars to this vehicle that I will try to elaborate on:


City Driving: Around the town, this car is easy to maneuver and park.  When I drove this car, I used to live in San Francisco (S.F.), known for their "small" parking spaces.  There is enough power in the engine to climb the hills in S.F. but because of it's small turning radius of approximately 32 feet, it was a Godsend for parallel parking in S.F.  The power rack and pinion steering also played a great help in driving around town.  Suspension is independent on all four corners, a rarity at the time for economy cars.  This made the Sentra better handling with a compliant ride.

Highway Driving: On the freeway, you definitely need to mix the gearshift in order to obtain freeway speeds.  The Sentra was rated with a 90 hp with 92 ft/lbs motor pulling a 2300 lbs car.  Definitely not true sports car material but enough to get you from point A to point B.  0-60 specs at the time was rated at 13 seconds.  Not what you call fast.  At freeway speeds, the noise you would hear is mainly from the tires.  The shape of the Sentra Sport Coupe cut the air extremely well.  I would say that the noise you would hear in the interior was the same or better than the current Acura Integras which were tested to 74dBs, which is somewhat noisy.  There are many economy cars that now test at 70-71dBs, a halfing in noise levels.   

Gearbox: Somewhat notchy but with short throws.  Engaging the clutch was very easy.  You definitely needed to use the hand brake whenever you were stopped on a hill.  The engine did not have enough power to start without the hand brake assist.

Interior: All cloth interior with the front seats shaped into Recaro-like seats.  Very comfortable.  Even the rear seat was comfortable but for people under 5 ft 8 inches.  Definitely a rear seat for two larger adults but it was designed for three since it is a bench seat with three seat belts.  These rear seats do fold down in a 50/50 split fashion for increase cargo volume.  With the seats up, trunk volume is approximately 12 cu. ft.  With the seats down, cargo volume is approximately 43 cu. ft.  Enough room to carry a bike.  Passenger volume is approximately 84 cu. ft.   

Ergonomics: Everything is within easy reach.  The dials on the dash are not impeded by anything.  Night time illumination of the dash is excellent.  Everything can be easily seen.  

Economy:  This is where the car shines.  Even though the car was rated for a 25 city and 36 highway mpg, I actually received 26 city and 47 highway.  This car was the best car I ever driven for highway economy.  The gas tank was 13.2 gallons.  That was enough range for me to go from S.F. to Lake Tahoe and back on one tank of gas, an approximate 500 mile trip.  

Reliability:  Never had a problem whatsoever.  Parts to this car are also inexpensive.  Also, a DIY could easily work on this car.  Everything is easy to work on.

Upgraded cloth seating surfaces

Conclusions:
If you are looking for an economical, reliable car, you can't go wrong with the Sentra.  There are still many of these examples on the road in my area.  Definitely a great choice for a first car for a teenager.  Just enough power without them getting into trouble with great gas mileage.
