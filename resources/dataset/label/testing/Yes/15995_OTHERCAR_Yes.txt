            I got this vehicle last summer when my aunt upgraded to a Sienna. I need to haul stuff to school, and my Camry Wagon was getting a bit small, so I bought it off her. I have to say, it was a pretty good deal.

To start off, I have to say this car is VERY different than any other minivan out there today. Today's minivans are all cookie-cutter minivans, all with the same features. You buy any brand new minivan today, I guarantee you it's going to be layed out and optioned just like every other minivan out there. The Previa is very different.

First, the engine. My model is kinda austere, but even the most expensive type of the Previa never got anything above a 4-cylinder engine. The nicer ones have a supercharger to help it along at times, but I put put around without one. But, that's good enough for me. It IS a minivan. I don't plan to be towing anything along with me, and it's only going to be filled very few times, so a 4-cylinder engine is good enough for me. Next, that engine is mounted UNDER the driver, thus limiting the size, and guaranteeing that Toyota discontinue it because it can't handle a V6. But, the midmounted engine does give it incredible handling, only hindered by the high center of gravity. The van handles like a sedan. Then the second weird thing about my van is that it's RWD, but nice ones are AWD, another potential flaw of Toyota's. RWD may be good enough for maybe Florida or Arizona, but here in Michigan, it's probably better to have AWD or at least FWD, but my car is good enough with weights in the back. 

Inside, the interior is very spacy and futuristic, indicitive of it's early 90's design. The interior impresses everyone whose seen it, and it's still pretty cool to me, even after six months. The glove compartment is cavernous as a result of the design, and my friends have deemed it &quot;the well.&quot; The trouble with the glove compartment is, there's absolutely no way they could put in a passenger side air bag, which is another reason why they gave this model the ax. The &quot;cockpit&quot; is designed with visibility and roominess in mind. The driver is sitting on the engine, so he or she is higher than most drivers, and has a commanding view. The car only offers the passenger side sliding door, as do all minivans before the late 90's. The rear seat splits and folds up to the sides, which I thought was novel, because I didn't want to leave the third row behind to carry my stuff, like you'd have to do with most minivans. It's kind of a pain in the butt to put it up, but it's not like you're going to do it every day, and it's worth it. You can fold down the second and third row to lay flat so you can haul plywood or drywall too.

If you're looking for a well designed van, get the Previa. It handles like a sedan and It's different, and it still turns heads. But do get the AWD and supercharged versions. The RWD version probably isn't the best idea for snowy regions, but I've survived so far.
