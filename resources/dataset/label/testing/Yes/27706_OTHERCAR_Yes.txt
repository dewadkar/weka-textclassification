              To think I actually wanted an Acura!  I remember when i first got my eclipse: I wanted something that was reliable, that is physically appealing, and more importantly, one that is fast.  I tried several Acura dealerships and test drove the GS-R and fell in love with it.  Wanting to expand my options and compare the GS-R to other cars, I went to a Mitsubishi dealership and test drove the Eclipse GSX.  What a rush!
  The price was extremely high at the time I purchased it.  It was a brand new car, one that was totally redesigned from its older counterpart, and I wasn't so sure whether if the price was worth it.  Compared to other top-of-the-line models out there, the Eclipse GSX was among the cheapest.  For all the things it offers (turbo, leather seats, all wheel drive, plus ABS brakes), the price seemed reasonable enough.
  Driving the car is almost like flying.  Their is a definite turbo-lag, but once the RPM hits 3,000, there's this feeling of immense power coming from inside the engine and the car jumps into full gear.  Speed is definitely this cars specialty.  Also, the AWD allows me to drive up hills like nothing and cling to the roads on rainy days, and the ABS brakes quickly slows down the car.  With these features, this Eclipse is a speed demon.
   Up until now, I haven't had my car serviced for any engine troubles.  I once brought my car in to get the seats fixed, and for the occasional tune-up, but other than that I haven't had any real serious trouble with the engine.  The only downside to this car is that the turbo eats up the gas.  I average around 200 miles per tank in this car, and since it only takes super unleaded gasoline, I end up paying $20+ each time at the gas station.  Despite this, I love my car and it takes me from here to there in no time.<br><br>
