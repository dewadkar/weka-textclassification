            I recently had the opportunity to drive a Mazda Millenia for a week while on a vacation.  Mazda originally intended to position this car as the entry-level car in a new luxury division to take on the best Japanese (Lexus and Infiniti) and German (Mercedes, BMW and Audi) companies.  However, because the Japanese economy entered into a prolonged recession during the early 1990s, Mazda canned the idea of creating a separate division and simply badged the Millenia as a Mazda.  As the flagship car offered by Mazda today, the Millenia is large, luxurious and represents all that is good and some of what is bad from Mazda.

Exterior Styling:  The Millenia's exterior is conservative, yet a bit sporty at the same time.  This car won't offend anyone but it won't make anyone stop and stare either.  While the car has been available in its current body style for a number of years, it still looks good compared to many of its peers (think of the Nissan Maxima).  

Interior Styling/Ergonomics: The interior is also designed in a conservative manner.  The optional leather seats were comfortable and supportive.  The door handles are finished in shiny chrome and brighten up the interior a little.  The fake wood trim on the center console looks really fake and should be deleted in favor of metal (which has been in vogue in a number of German cars) or plastic trim.  The driving instruments are very well lit in day or night and contain large, very readable numbers.  The biggest mistake about the interior is the climate control system, which consists of a confusing dial and a bunch of buttons.  The climate control system is confusing to operate and doesn't offer the wide range of options that most cars in this class do.  In addition, at night, the readout from the climate control system reflects off the front windshield, which is annoying and not well thought out.  Mazda also did not put enough space in between the gas and brake pedals in the Millenia.  My size 11 shoes touched both pedals on numerous occasions and I had to consciously tilt my right foot to properly press on the gas pedal without also hitting the brake pedal.  I have never had this problem with any other car before.  In addition, the mirrors on the Millenia are not large enough.  I did not have confidence using those mirrors because they showed so little of the road and of other cars.  I instead just looked over my shoulder each time I turned or changed lanes instead of using the mirrors and looking over my shoulder.

Engine:  The Millenia's base 6 cylinder engine provides 170 hp.  At regular driving speeds on the road, the engine has adequate power and a generous amount of torque.  However, starting from a stop, the Millenia lacks much punch and I found myself inadvertently gunning the engine in order to get decent acceleration.  The sudden rush of good torque at about 3500 rpm was very noticeable and didn't make my girlfriend very happy because she felt like we were driving a turbo-charged sports car instead of a luxury sedan.  Mazda offers a 210 hp version of this engine, but should make that engine standard in all Millenias.

Handling:  The Millenia handles like most Japanese luxury sedans which means that it understeers a lot.  The steering is generally very direct and the car is pretty easy to handle on the road.  However, I had trouble maneuvering the car in parking lots where it fits into parking spaces like a much larger car.  The suspension dampens the bumps and other road imperfections more than its' German peers and is definitely better suited for leisurely driving through straight roads than for fast driving on windy back roads.

Overall, the Mazda Millenia is a solid car and offers consumers a good combination of performance, styling, luxury for the money.  This car is more fun to drive than a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry, provides the same amount of enjoyment as the Acura TL and is not quite up to the standard set by a BMW 330i or Audi A4.
