            I was looking at several of the smaller SUVs, comparing the Honda CRV, the Subaru Forester and the RAV4 for price, reliability, handling and room. My husband and I drive 2200 miles to Montana or Wyoming every other year for 3 weeks and I wanted something that would be comfortable to ride in for 2 1/2 days each way, as well as easy to get around in the &quot;wild wild west.&quot; 

The local Toyota dealer had a 4th of July sale last year and I couldn't resist. I'd looked in and checked out the two competitors, but hadn't yet experienced the RAV4. Wow! There is so much more room, especially in the cargo area, than in either of the others. 

We were able to take 3 weeks worth of all weather clothes, 2 cases of wine, all of my husband's fly fishing stuff (2 pairs of waders) and all of my art supplies. And we had to  stop before we got there to buy a week's worth of groceries and had room for them. My husband had been skeptical, but he was quite impressed with how much that it held. 

He was even more skeptical about taking it off road and I think was hoping to prove it wasn't a &quot;grownup SUV&quot;, but he was proven wrong again. He took us off road about 2 miles through really nasty rocks and hills. The terrain was so bad that a rock punctured my tire through the sidewall! We got the tire changed in nothing flat and were back on the road in no time. 

Now my husband is trying to figure out how he can sleep in it on fishing trips. I'm sure he could, but he'd better be awfully nice to me. I have to drive 400 miles a week for my job and I won't give up that RAV4 easily!<br><br>
