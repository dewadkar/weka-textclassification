            I bought my C-2 (European name of D-230) in France in 2002 for 269 euros and have been almost completely satisfied with this camera. Think I'll keep it for another couple of years even though it's only 2 MP resolution, but I don't need more for a moment since I'm completely satisfied with printed quality pictures (up to 11x17cm with 1600x1200 resolution). It is quite light, easily fits my pockets, so I can have it always when I go for parties or travel. It's easy to use, menu structure is well organized I think. Macromode gives you a possibility to shot a very closely situated objects with a high quality. It has as well quicktime movie mode, but it's pity that this option is without sound and uses only very low resolution what made me never to use this option. It comes with 16 MB SmartMedia Card which I found not enough when I travel since it allowed to store maximum 37 high quality pictures. So I upgraded it to 128MB and now I feel comfortable and don't think about memory usage.
Now about negative points. First of all, it run away your batteries very quickly, so it doesn't make sense to go somewhere without additional pack of fully charged batteries (it uses 2 AA by the way). AND ALWAYS USE RECHARGEABLE NIMH PACK and not usual alcaline ones, since with rechargeable it lasts much longer. Another negative point is that with making night pictures I have to spend a lot of time to choose correct level of white balance since it gives disbalance in color tones with majority of orange/red.
About movie mode unusefulness I've already said above...
In conclusion, it's a nice camera which I like a lot because of its design and excellent quality in this range.
