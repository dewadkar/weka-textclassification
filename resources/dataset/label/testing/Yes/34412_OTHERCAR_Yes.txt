            I bought my 2000 Tiburon in January 2000 and I have been loving every minute of driving since then.  The car is fast, fast, fast!  Every time I am stopped at a red light someone wants to race me and I usually win!  Some of the many standards of the car are cruise control, ac, and power windows.  I have all that plus an electric sunroof and cd player.  The interior of the car resembles a spaceship, it is totally different than anything I have ever seen.  It wraps around you and makes it easy to reach everything without taking your eyes off the road for long.  I have only seen about 5 Tiburons on the road since last year, so you feel unique and you see people looking at your car, trying to figure out what it is.  So far no problems, but with the excellent warranty that's one thing I don't have to worry about.  Well, to update my opinion, it is now May and I have received a recall notice on my car radio/tape/cd player and my check engine light recently came on and then after 2 days shut off by itself.  Nothing major, hopefully not a sign of things to come.<br><br>
