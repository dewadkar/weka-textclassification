            About 3 months ago, after much research, I purchased a 1999 Honda Prelude.  I am a 25 year old male with a moderate income.  I was looking for a sports car that was fun to drive, but also very reliable.  I compared the car to the Acura Integra GS-R, Chevy Camaro Z-28, Ford Mustang GT, and the Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T.  After evaluating all of the above options, I decided that the Honda Prelude had the best combination of features.  The Z-28 is the fastest, but several of my friends have had problems with them (build quality).  My previous car was a Honda Civic, so I know first-hand that they make high quality cars.

I liked the Eclipse quite a bit, but the engine is turbocharged and I know 2 people who own Eclipses who have blown 6 turbochargers between them.  The fit and finish on the Mustang didn't seem high enough for a $20K car.  The Integra had quite a bit going for it, including leather interior which the Prelude does not have.  One of the main reasons I decided against the Integra was that most of the power lies very high in the power band (above 5000 RPM).  So to feel the power, you *really* need to rev it.

One nice thing about the Prelude, is that it only comes fully loaded.  Not many dealer add-ons are available, making it that much easier to get a good deal.  A/C, power moonroof, power doors/locks and premium CD stereo are all standard.  There are only two models available, SH and Base.  The main difference (besides slight cosmetic differences) is that the SH handles somewhat better - it also costs $2500 more.  The automatic transmission is only available on the Base model.

The only option I added was a rear spoiler (~$500).  The SH comes standard with this.  I have now owned the car for about three months and I do not have a single complaint.  It is quite quick (200 HP), looks good, and is very reliable.  The overall build quality is excellent.  The interior is nicely designed and updated, without being &quot;fancy&quot;.  Everything is very functional, yet looks great too.  The trunk has plenty of room, although the rear seats can only comfortably accommodate younger children (adults are very cramped).

All buttons are logically located and easy to use.  The manual transmission shifts quickly and smoothly.  The engine is fairly quiet, although it does have a slight high-tech sounding whine to it.  Gas mileage is average - I get about 22-24 MPG around town.  The Prelude feels very stable, yet nimble at the same time.  It corners with ease and almost no body roll.  With the windows and sunroof closed the interior is very quiet even at highway speeds.  The seats are very comfortable for short or long trips.

I have not had a single problem with it.  Everything was built correctly and reliably and it appears it will stay that way.  I ultimately decided on the Prelude because it is a great combination of reliability and sporty-ness.  It handles extremely well, accelerates quickly and looks good too.  One of the only marks against the Prelude is the high price.  At $23,500 MSRP, it's a bit pricey.  If the price were a little lower, this would be a steal.  As it is, I would expect a little more power (250 HP?) for the price.  But come on!  We're talking about a normally aspirated 2.2 liter 4-cylinder engine here!

Overall, I couldn't be more delighted with the Honda Prelude.  A reliable sports car!  I didn't think they'd ever make one!


<b>UPDATE 2ooo.07.14</b> - Buying a Used Prelude? (Current Generation):

5 additional HP were added in 99.  Make sure you get the 5spd, not auto (sportshift) as it drains 5 HP just having it, plus manual is always more fun and you have much more control over the car.  97-2000 model years are all pretty much the same with the exception of some small touches: 99-on has a &quot;mesh&quot; type front grill which is really small (you can barely tell the difference), and in 97 and 98 you could get a tan/beige dash, which isn't available from anymore (from 99-on it's an all black interior which I think looks way better anyway).

Acceleration is comparable in all years, although the SH model feels a little different because of the addition of the ATTS traction unit.  Concerning the difference between non-SH (base) and SH models: the SH comes stock with the ATTS traction unit which is makes it handle noticeably better in the big turns plus the suspension is a little tighter (though I would upgrade the springs and shocks in either case).  Inside, the SH adds a leather-wrapped shifter and that's about it.  As for outside appearances, the SH comes stock with a rear spoiler, body-color lower side and rear skirts (where the ground effects would be if you added them), plus different (and I think cooler) 5-spoke wheels.  Also, because it has the spoiler, the rear brake light on the back deck isn't there, it's in the spoiler itself, which looks better.  If you buy a base model, and add the spoiler, the disconnected light will still be in the back deck (just behind the back seats), which you will want to remove and replace with a SH model deck so there's no square hole where the light used to be.  No models come from the factory with leather, although I believe that it's a dealer-installed option and it may have come from the factory with leather in earlier (97-98) years.  As always, I'm just trying to help everyone make an intelligent purchasing decision, so feel free to email me if you have any questions.<br><br>
