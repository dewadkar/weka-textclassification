            I needed a reliable and solid extra cab compact pickup truck after I decided to sell my 1989 Jeep Comanche (THIS IS A GREAT standard cab Truck).  I drove all of the domestic and import models and it all came down to either the Ford Ranger (economical but not as reliable) or Toyota Pickup.  I bought my truck in 1997, an it only had about 32,000 miles on it an very minor body damage.  This is truck that I bought:  <br>  1994 Toyota Pickup XtraCab<br>  2-wheel drive<br>  5-speed manual transmission<br>  3.0-L V-6 engine<br>  Full gauges, cruise control, rear sliding window<br>  <br>  I LOVE THIS TRUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  PROS:<br>  <br>  1) Dependable - I have not any problems with this truck since I bought it (with the exception of replacing one headlight bulb).<br>  2) Strong - The V-6 engine really moves the extracab model of this truck<br>  3) Well Built - This truck is sturdy and well laid out inside and out.<br>  4) Stable - The 2WD version sits low to the ground (almost as low as some cars) and is very stable on the road.<br>  5) Roomy - the front seats are very roomy, but only kids fit comfortably in the rear seats (HEY, ITS ONLY A COMPACT TRUCK).<br>  <br>  CONS:<br>  <br>  1) EXTREMELY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE - The head gasket on the 3.0L V-6 engines were recalled by Toyota.  I took mine in for the recall and my local dealership installed unnecessary parts without my permission and then tried to charge me for it.  I wrote a four page letter to Toyota - USA corporate headquarters detailing the experience and they just blew it off completely.  Thank God that these trucks are well built because you won't get anywhere with the local or national Toyota customer representatives.  Toyota employees tend to be very rude, unhelpful, arrogant, and totally unaware of the concept of good customer service.  TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST IN THE INDUSTRY!!!!<br>  2) Pickup bed - the sidewalls of the pickup bed are fairly low and limit the cargo capacity of the truck.<br>  <br>  RECOMMENDATION - A GREAT TRUCK FOR THE MONEY/HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br>  <br>  NOTE:  Try to buy the original Toyota pickup models instead of the newer Toyota Tacoma models.  The Tacoma models are note as well built.  Buy Toyota trucks built on or before 1994!<br><br>
