            My previous vehicle was on its last leg, so I decided to check around about a new car.  I did my homework.  I checked Consumer Reports and many online sources about any recommendations or suggestions.  I decided that I wanted a compact car, and preferably a Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, or a Geo Prizm.  Just my luck, I found a 1993 Geo Prizm at a local dealership, and it was really nice.  Not trusting the dealership (because I don't trust any of them) I took it home for an evening to have it looked over by some mechanic friends of mine.  What I found out, is that a Geo, the 93's at least, are made from at least 50% Toyota products.  The engine, radiator, alternator, and parts of the frame have Toyota stamped all over them.  I thought I bought a Geo, which was owned by Chevrolet, but I have since come to find out that it is a split between a Chevy and a Toyota.  


I love almost everything about this vehicle.  I bought the 1993 Geo Prizm Lsi edition.  It had 55,000 miles on it.  It is 5-speed manual with 1.8 l engine.  It has incredible pick-up for a four cylinder.  It came with aluminum rims, power locks, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, driver side air bag, premium stereo/cassette player, and four doors.  The dealership was asking $6995, but I paid $5200.  It drives so smoothly, and when the engine is running, you can't hear it at all inside the car, and when outside it is very difficult to tell if it is running.   Gas mileage is really awesome.  I previously took a road trip from Wisconsin to New Mexico, and I averaged 40 Miles/gallon.  The shifting is incredibly smooth.  The stereo, as previously mentioned, is awesome.  A nice tone of bass, as well as clear and vibrant tones pour from the factory speakers.  It also has a very nice locking feature.  When you unlock the vehicle with a key from either of the front doors, you can unlock all four door, and conversely, lock all four.  It is a little function that is very hand and useful.  


I recommend this vehicle for those who don't want to worry about car problems.  I am a college student, and it suits me perfectly.  It would also be very appropriate for a small family, or older individuals.  Overall, the car is wonderful, and I haven't had any problems at all with it.  When I called the previous owner, he said he only got rid of it because his company was going to buy him a car.  Otherwise, he would have kept it.  He loved it, I love it, and I am sure if the opportunity comes your way, you will love it too.<br><br>
