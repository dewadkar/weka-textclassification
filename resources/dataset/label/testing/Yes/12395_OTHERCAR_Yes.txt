            I bought my jeep about a year ago. I have since removed the hard top and installed a Best Top Supertop. If you want a good top avoid the factory top and get a Supertop. I also put a pro lift 4in suspension lift another good and bad move good move is that with the lift and tires It looks mean But bad move is it is very bouncy I would do it all over again I get a lot of compliments on it. Iï¿½m young so I can take it but It defiantly takes your ride away. Some of the pros are great turning radius, decent on gas and has a lot of pep you must get the 6cyl my opinion is the 4 cyl has not enough pep, winter time it is great in the snow 4X4, summer time you can put the top down and enjoy the beautiful weather, and it takes but 5 min to put it up or down, It is very dependable I have 108,000 miles on it and It runs like a champ, All in all it is a great vehicle...cons it is a little small if you need to pick up big Items from the store, With a soft top It can get a little noisy when driving at higher speeds, And with a soft top it is very easy to be broken into. I have to say it is the best vehicle I have ever owned and I would not give it up.
