             I purchased a 92 grand am used with 80,000 miles on it in 1994. I picked it up for a great price thinking how many miles can an american car get out of it. I now have 218,000 miles on it and still wonder when i should get a new car. I try to keep up on oil changes regularly but some tines I am not prompt. I can say that over the years the car has been driven mostly city miles and driven hard and I have to say this car still runs great, The only problem I have really had was the struts and shocks were changed 3 times and the rear wheel cylinders were just changed. I have the grand am se with the 3.3l engine automatic. The only complaint I have is the window on the driver side the track is broken and window has to be pulled up. I strongly recommend this car for anyone interested and will strongly consider buying another grand am when and if this car finally gives out. i have to say I dont see any signs of this happening too soon<br><br>
