            This was my first digital camera - as well as my entrance into the realm of photography.  I love it!  At first, I was intimidated with all the features, but once I learned what they were and what they did, I realized what a great camera this is, especially for those who like to do more than just point and shoot.  This camera is comparable to the Canon G2 - just doesn't have a swivel lcd.  It comes with a wireless remote - great for taking pictures at higher fstops (especially with shaky hands).  

One big problem I encountered early on was a dead green pixel.  It drove me crazy, I had to edit each pic in Corel to clone out the green pixel.  BUT I later discovered the great feature on this Olympus, pixel mapping!  I just need to remember to do it often - a little annoying, but nothing is perfect and it's a little thing.  I love the manual white balance and all the settings including: A/S/M priority; many different resolution choices - the tiff images are superb, but the shq which is one level under tiff also creates great pics and uses less space; custom reset; noise reduction; selected flash settings; macro; spot metering...well there are just soo many of them.

After shopping around for other cameras for my office, I found that this camera has a lot to offer - even if it is a little higher priced.  I even considered getting a new one - a digital slr - est at $2000, but I really don't have the money, and besides, for a really good slr, I'd have to spend at least $5000 - I'm not a professional, so I'll get one when I win the lotto.

The operation of the camera may seem a bit hard to learn, but with a little attention and practice, you'll soon reap the benefits of this camera - well worth it!

Make sure to keep extra batteries on hand.  I'm the kind of person that relies heavily on the lcd display, this sucks up the battery life.  ALSO, the lcd gets hot quickly and does some funky stuff on the screen and sometimes on the image, but also something I can live with.  I just need to turn off the lcd and let it cool once in a while.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
