            I bought this vehicle as a sales vehicle to get me out to the jobs, and to use it as a moving billboard. I bought it cheap, expecting to replace it in a short while with something newer. I added it to a fleet of Astro vans. 
I was genuinely pleased with this vehicle. It got almost double the MPG than the Astro's, was more peasant to drive and the stock sound system was great. 
It has some "European" comfort features, like the auto headlights and the central locks that are great. The individual seating system is great, and the composite body panels are the best! The rest of my service vans will stay Astro or equal, because they are a heavier duty unit, but the van I use will likely always be Lumina. 
I have nearly 300,000 K's on the van and it burns no oil, and runs like a top! I have driven this van over 100,000 of those kilometers and have had very little trouble with it. Regular maintenance items only with a little bit of trouble with the lock up torque converter wanting to stay locked even coming to a stop. This happens infrequently, and I haven't even tried to get it fixed.
