            I currently own a '91 Skylark and have had a great experience with it.  I purchased it as used, low mileage vehicle a couple of years ago and it currently has about 48K miles now.  Aside from normal maintenance and expected replacement of wear parts, such as the battery, exhaust, and brakes, it runs perfectly and has given me absolutely no problems.  The car is not pampered.  It is driven daily in heavy stop-and-go city traffic for about a half hour commute each way.  The body shows no signs of rust even after 10 years on salted wintry Pennsylvania roads.  

The interior is comfortable for the driver and front passenger.  However, the rear seating offers little leg room for adults, if you have a tall driver or passenger.  My vehicle is very limited in the luxury options... manual windows and locks, AM/FM with no cassette, etc.  However, it has an awesome air conditioner.  You could practically freeze meat on the dashboard in July with this a/c.  On the contrary, the heater takes a bit longer to warm up than one would like on a cold morning.

Replacement parts costs seem reasonable and the gas mileage is good.  Even with the daily commute, I fill it up less than weekly.  I am not sure of the exact MPG.
