            We had minivans all through our child rearing years. Once we got out of the little leagues, scout troops, etc, etc. I never thought we would get one again. We switched to sedans, and a few years ago, a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Last year we, against my better judgement, got a Plymouth Voyager. We got the quad seating package.

This turned out the be the perfect vehicle for us. The rear bench seat stays in the garage most of the time and we use the quad seating for ourselves and another couple. This leaves plenty of room in the back for golf clubs, bicycles, picnic and swimming gear or whatever. The fold down seats expand the useable cargo space dramatically without having to remove the seat. For example, bringing a child home from college is a snap. Fold down one of the rear bucket sets, pack the van full, and there is still plenty of room for child and parents.

We are trading this one in soon for a Chrysler Town and Country with AWD. Time for a little luxury for the old folks!!<br><br>
