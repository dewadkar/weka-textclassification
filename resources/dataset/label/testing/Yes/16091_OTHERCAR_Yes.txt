            I test-drove a Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 4x4 with the standard 4.7L V8, the largest offered in any new Jeep.  The sport-ute is no doubt a powerful machine.  It's passing power and acceleration is nice, and I found the overall on-road capabilities to be excellent.  Of course, I couldn't test the Quadra-Drive off-road with the salesman in the back seat, but noted magazines (i/e., Petersen's) have praised its off-road prowess.  On-road handling isn't quite near the level of perfection you would expect in a 2000 Limited expensive vehicle.  Both my friend and I could detect a decent amount of body roll, and while it can corner, it stands no chance against the LR Discovery II Series, which have the Active Cornering Enhancement (ACE) feature that makes the seemingly top-heavy sport-ute corner like a sports car.  However, the kudos were nice.  Everything was there, from leather to power to overhead computer.  One interior problem: the CD changer is in the rear cargo area...not very practical.<br><br>
