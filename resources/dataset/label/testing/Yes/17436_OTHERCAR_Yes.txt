            I bought my 1999 Passport 3 months ago after careful research of all utility vehicles in the Passport's class. Not only did I review articles, but I tool time to visit local dealers and drove the other sport utilities to compare each auto's handling and performance. Several of the higher priced sport utes were a tad swankier interior wise, but I find the Honda quite ergonomically correct, comfortable, understated, and finished tastefully. I think the outside appearance speaks for itself as it is as handsome as any of the models on the market. As far as performance, the V6 is plenty to give the car good acceleration and pep in city and on the highway. I opted for no 4 wheel drive and a manual transmission, as my Passport is strictly my run around car; perfect for throwing in the dog to take along, hauling my stuff from Home Depot, and all the other items I hesitated to toss in my Acura Legend. For the money, I am convinced it is the bargain of Sport Utes. <br><br>
