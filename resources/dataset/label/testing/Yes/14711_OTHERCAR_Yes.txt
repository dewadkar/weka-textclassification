            At 33k front right bearing failed, a screaming wheel symptomatic. At 40k back right bearing failed, a low, increasingly loud thrumming or rumble symptomatic. Warranty covered the first failure. Second failure beyond warranty, but Subaru willingly covered it, stating they would also cover future failures. Service on failures first rate. Car is thrumming again. Techs say problem is cupped rear tires caused by lack of my rotating them and/or bearing problems. Subaru volunteered to pay half of cost of four new tires, four because awd demands tires of equal wear or problems may ensue. The stock tires (DuelerH/TD684) fell 15k short of warranted miles. Subaru said tire rotation should occur every 6k. Replacement bearings should be Legacy bearings according to Subaru. I hate the bearing event, love Subaru's acceptance of their responsibility, and actually am quite fond of the car when all is said and done, although i sincerely hope bearing failure is part of the done. Oh, yes. Bought leather seats because we thought standard seats were like sitting on a plank.

Car now (12/8/'03) has over 80k and going strong.
