             I have been a Chevrolet Buyer for 5 years. I had a Camaro before my Monte Carlo. The Monte is as much fun to drive as was my Camaro. The car is quick and responsive. The real fun part is it great on gas as well. I also like the fact living in Mn. I now can drive a &quot;Sporty&quot; car in the winter as well as the summer. The Monte Carlo I have has all the bells and whistles. I love the controls for my radio and cd player on the steering wheel. I never have to reach to change stations.  My Monte is the Z34 the ride is harder. That's to be expected. I would not recommend the two door to a family the back seat is a hassle getting in and out of. I'd say buy the LS and get the four door model. I have no real complaints and would buy another Monte Carlo in the future.  Its a fun and enjoyable car to drive.<br><br>
