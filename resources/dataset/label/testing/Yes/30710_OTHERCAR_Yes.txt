            Okay this is about the new 2000's.

I purchased mine in July of 1999.  It was a month old.  I bought it for a decent amount this being the first car I have bought brand new.  It was a 2.2L 4-cylinder which is pretty zippy.  It is also very sharp looking.  The design changes for the 2000 models make the car so much more cooler.  The front fascia and rear fascia are slightly different and so is the added side skirts.  Originally, I wanted the Sun and Sound Sunfire but just my luck none of the nearby Pontiac dealers had any.  Every dealer told me that they could locate one and it would take a few weeks.  Well I got impatient.  I used the GMC Buypower to locate my 2000.  There was a dealer about 20 miles from my house that was willing to get it for me because they were trading a 4-door to a particular dealer that had one.  Needless to say, I had my car in 3 days.  They were nice enough to give me the 2000 for the 1999 price.


A FEW OF MY &quot;LIKES&quot;:
I am very impressed with my sunfire so far.  Knock on wood.  I stand a whopping 5'3 whereas my boyfriend is 6'5.  He can comfortably drive my Sunfire with plenty of leg room.  The back seat is spacious and the handy fold down rear back seat is the greatest.  It is so nice to get into the trunk and not have to stop and open up the trunk all I have to do is pull the cloth handle down.  Another handy device is the child car seat attachment in the back near the rear windshield.  It helps in securing the car seat in safely.  This comes in handy for me and would be people who have children that require car seats.
 
I was fortunate enough to buy a Sunfire with the Monsoon Audio system.  This stereo rocks!!!! It sounds awesome for just being stock.  The speakers are clear and the reception is very nice.  Me being the teenager and liking the loud music....this stereo cannot be passed up!  Another nifty device is 5 drink holders that the car is equipped with.  There are two in the front near the heating/cooling controls.  This is a little pesky when trying to adjust the heat controls and also having drinks in the holders however they are very nice and keep the drinks held in tightly.  The center console has 2 built in holders when you open it and it folds back so that the passengers in back have something to set their drinks in.  I also sometimes use the cup that I think is meant for change as a cup holder.  I also like my interior cloth.  Its hard to explain the exact pattern however the color is graphite and it is accented by colorful stitching in rainbow colors.  I have also found the black carpeting to be a savior especially when raining and snowing.  All the dirt and grime aren't as noticeable.  My power sunroof is a blast and the nice fold back cover makes it look very nice.  The sunroof opens and closes very fast with no hesitations and very little wind noise.

So far I have got all of my windows tinted, rims, the rear Sunfire on the bumper and the Pontiac on the front painted in silver metalflake paint.  Coming up is a better stereo with more goodies : ) I can't wait!

A FEW OF MY &quot;DISLIKES&quot;:

The only major problem I had occurred 24 hours after I drove it off the lot.  One of the hose clamps to the cooling system came off thus leaving antifreeze all over the parking lot.  You can't mistake the pink DEX-COOL antifreeze thats for sure!  Just my luck it was the beginning of August and things were heating up here in Illinois.  

I was very discouraged with the clamp/hose incident the first day I had the car.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and they took care of it all for me.  They even checked the heads to make sure they didn't get messed up from the heat.

Another dislike is that I don't have power windows or cruise control.  I have the security system which is very useful.  I did check out the recent shipment of 2000's at my local dealer and to my suprise I found maybe 3 of the 10 had power windows.  I didn't feel as bad then.

Okay, this is where I get a little angry.  The major gripe I have about my car is the integrity of the paint.  I am not sure if it's just my car that has a thin paint coat or they are all like that.  I have had several rock chips in my hood and the funny thing is I don't drive my car that much.  It has 3800 miles on it and its 6 months old.  You do the math.

You really have to be careful and take care of your car I have been lucky enough to be friends with a man who owns a car shop.  He tinted my windows and repaired the rock clips on my hood.  I guess maybe I am really picky about it because I work so hard to pay for it and keep it nice.

Overall, this car is very cute and stylish and also very affordable.  It performs well and brakes very nicely in any conditions.<br><br>
