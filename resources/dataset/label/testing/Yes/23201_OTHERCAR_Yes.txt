            I bought my 1996 Honda Accord LX when I first began college.  It has been driven about 101,000 miles (mostly city!!) with relatively no problems other than slow power windows.  Reliability is its key feature; I have not performed any maintenance to the car other than changing the fluids and filters.  I am extremely harsh on cars, and this Honda has never been phased by my driving.  I have had three Fords in the past.  Two of them have caught on fire, and the other one lived in the shop only after one year of age.  Thus, it is nice to see that someone can make a good car.  In addition, the car is fun to drive, good with gas, has great visibility (even for short drivers), has a large trunk and quite frankly is the perfect college car.  As for safety, I have had several small wrecks in the car (none my fault).  The car has never been damaged much from the wrecks, and I have always walked away from the car with no injuries.  Thus, it seems to be a pretty safe car to me.  
     Now for the cons:  the seats are not too comfy, road noise is somewhat high, the air conditioner is not quite powerful enough (especially with a dark exterior), the interior is smallish for a sedan and the engine is a bit noisy (though quiet for a four cylinder).  However, the value of this car tremendously outweighs the cons.
     If you are looking for a reliable and fun car, look no further, and with four doors, it even has room for a small family or a few friends.  I highly recommend this car!
