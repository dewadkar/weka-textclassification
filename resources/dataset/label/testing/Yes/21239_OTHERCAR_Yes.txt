            The Camry that I have experienced with is a V6 Le edition. It was everything I thought it would be and more. The car is much smoother than the older versions. I was really impressed. We went through pot holes and I was amazed by the fact that I barely felt any type of bump when driving over it. Also, the torque is deceiving. I couldn't believe at the acceleration that I was able to experience. The most impressive feature I felt about the car was the car audio system. It was truly astonishing and it was the system that comes out of the factory. The handling was good as well and I believe that this car is truly one of the best buys. I would buy it any day especially for a student. <br><br>
