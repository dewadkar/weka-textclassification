            I spend alot of time researching digital cameras before I made the final purchase, and I'm glad I went with the Olympus D-510.  

Ultimately, the bottom line for any camera is does it take good pictures?  With its 2.1 Megapixel picture ability, the D-510 takes great quality pictures.  Whether you want to keep your pictures in digital form to view on the computer or print them out like normal film, you are going to be very satisfied with its quality.  In fact, the naked eye cannot distinguish between a 35mm film print and digital print from the D-510 (at 4x6 size).  I would even say the digital prints are better because you can edit them before printing (remove red eye, etc.)

As far as camera use is concerned, the D-510 is fairly easy to learn.  To take a basic picture, you pull the lens cover (built into the camera) all the way to the right and the lens will extend out the camera.  From there you simply point and hit the silver button on top of the camera. Next to the "shoot" button, there is also a button to zoom in/out - it works the same way as most zoom cameras.

Reviewing pictures is easy as well.  Simply hit one button next to the LCD screen to turn on the screen and then scroll left or right to view pictures you have taken.  Some cameras I have used have a delay between viewing pictures, but there is no such delay on the D-510.  

Other nice features include the sliding lens cover.  This is useful because it is very sturdy protection for the lens.  You can carry this camera in just about anything without worry about damaging the lens.  The camera is a little bit bulky to carry around in your pocket, but if you have pants with big pockets, it can be done (I do it all the time).  Size of the camera is general is pretty good.  Its a little too big for most pockets, like I mentioned, but its a nice size to hold while you're taking pictures.

The one design issue I have with the D-510 is that there isn't any LCD on the top of the camera to show how many pictures you have left and battery power.  This was a feature on the previous version of the camera (the D-490), but for some reason it was taken away.  Instead, to view any of this information you have to turn on the back LCD, which is slightly annoying.  However, if you buy a bigger memory card you don't have to worry about the space for awhile.  

The other important things to remember about this camera is that it only comes with an 8MB smartmedia card a set of alkaline batteries.  With 8MB of memory, the camera can only hold about 20 or so pictures (HQ) before you need to upload and clear the memory. I bought myself a 64MB card (Sandisk brand, I think) for about $25 on sale.  Now I can store over 120 pictures without needing to upload.  As far as the batteries go, you'll probably want to invest in some rechargeable NI-MH batteries.  Since digital cameras need alot more power to function (with the LCD especially), you'll go through more batteries than with a normal camera.  You can get a charger with 4 rechargeable batteries at best buy for about $25.  Overall, though, the camera's power usage is quite low.  I can use the camera on and off for several weeks, with moderate LCD usage, and not have the batteries run out.  Just make sure you charge them before any vacations.
