            I went into the Toyota dealer fully expecting to get a Camry.  I've seen this car before, it's a bit small for my usual tastes and I wasn't initially crazy about the styling.  My wife liked the look of it and convinced me to test drive it.  I took out the XRS 6 spd for a spin because it was the only one they could easily get to without jockeying other cars around.  By the time I got done, this car really grew on me, I started to love the look of it and I was totally bored by the Camry.  I picked it up in red and got the 6 disc changer which sounds great.  The XRS also gives you ABS, 4 wheel disc brakes and 17 inch wheels.

I got the car on a lease and it turns out to have a slightly higher residual than the Camry despite the lower sticker price.  With the 4 doors the Matrix is very practical for dropping my 2 kids off at day care on the way to work and I find it really fun to drive with the 180HP engine under the hood.  I'd probably go for the Camry if I had a long highway commute because this car is a bit loud and isn't the smoothest ride but I just use this for zipping around town and weekend joy rides which it's great for.

I heard some criticisms in other reviews about the instrument panel and the layout of the dash but I didn't have a problem with any of that except for the somewhat cheap looking fake chrome trim.  I like the look of the shifter coming out of the dashboard although I find myself having to hunch forward slightly to reach it after sliding the seat all the way back to give myself sufficient leg room.  This car is also much narrower than I'm used to driving and I feel a little too much "closeness" to people other than my wife in the passenger seat.

Overall I'm very happy with my purchase - it had to be practical for my daily use but I find the distinctive styling and performance an extra bonus that gives me a little smile when I drive it.
