            I've only put a little over 700 miles on this truck, but I have to say I LOVE IT!  

My old truck is a bone-stock Toyota short-bed 4-banger 4x4 with over 130,000 hard miles on it, and it's only been to the dealer twice for minor repairs, so Toyota quality was foremost in my mind when making a decision on which vehicle to buy.  I looked at everything from the Dodge to the F150, but I kept on coming back to the Tacoma, and I'm glad I did.  Did mention that I LOVE THIS TRUCK?  

Still being in the break-in period, I haven't taken it over 55 miles an hour (for very long), and haven't made any full-throttle starts (except when I really had to), but I can tell you that this truck wants to get up and go!  Sure, you can feel the road, but I wasn't looking for a luxury car.  This truck handles well, rides solid, has plenty of smooth power, and turns heads (not to say that matters)!  

I got the extended-cab, and while the back "seats" are really only suitable for my 10-year-old, they're plenty roomy for extra cargo that doesn't want to ride in the bed.  The 4-speaker stereo/CD sounds awesome, the air-conditioning is almost too cold, and the custom wheels, dirt-tires, off-road suspension, cloth bucket seats and door panels, power windows, sliding rear window, and the bedliner combine to make this a very good looking and comfortable vehicle.  I can't wait to take it up in the hills and get it really dirty!  Got air bags, locking differential, and a security system, as well....

AND I LOVE THIS TRUCK!

 5/17/01: Okay, I take it back.  The seats are fine for a 2-3 hour drive, but when going from Disneyland to Mammoth... they SUCK!  If my underwater options ever recover, the first thing I'm getting is new seats.  Of course, I didn't expect executive-level, orthopedic, fully-padded leather-lined seats in a truck that cost less than $30K, but there you have it.  Other than that, the truck is still great.
