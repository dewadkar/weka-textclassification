            The Mitsubishi Galant is a reliable, stylish, four door vehicle that will take you and your spouse to the theatre or you and the kids to Little League practice. <br>When car shopping I looked at the Nissan Altima, Camry, and Mitsubishi Galant.  Based on looks, miles per gallon, cost, and durability-- I chose the Galant. <br><br> I have a 1994 Mitsubishi Galant with approximately 85,000 miles on it.   I bought it new when the new body style first came out.  The only repairs that I have had to make were:  a new battery and recently changed the timing belt and all other belts.  It still averages slightly over 30 miles a gallon and can hold up to five adults (four comfortably).  That along with a deep trunk makes this a great passenger car.  It rides very smooth and the thing that I love about it is every morning when I go to work, I know that my Galant will start and run.<br><br>With its stylish looks and four doors anyone from a single person to medium sized family would enjoy this car.  The Mitsubishi Galant is also priced so that it is a hard car to beat.<br><br><br><br><br>
