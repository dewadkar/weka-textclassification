            After having minivans for a while and having with trouble with some I got the Honda Odyssey. The Honda Odyssey is a great van for the family!  It is very comfortable, pretty inexpensive and a great minivan to have!  It is a pretty roomy 7 passenger car. 

The first four seats in the car are retractable and easy to lean back.  This makes sleeping in the minivan very comfortable and enjoyable. It also is very quite quite and smooth. And in the back you can tuck in the back seat underneath the minivan and it is very easy and convenient to bring it back up. The engine is very quite and it doesn't really feel like you are driving a minivan.  

This minivan has a very good heating and Air conditioning system which adds more to the comfortable feeling that the car brings.  It you can control the air conditioning  from the front of the minivan and also the center of the minivan.  But occasionally the windows heavily fog up.

On the side of the first four doors of the Honda Odyssey, are speakers that come from the radio and cassette players.  This minivan has a AM/FM radio and a cassette player that work very well.  Because of the speakers around the minivan it is almost like &quot;surround sound&quot; and is actually pretty cool!
  
Having driven this to Las Vegas and the Los Angeles, I have come to the conclusion that this is very comfortable and relaxing to drive long distances!  I highly recommend this minivan to family's with kids (especially on the younger side)!!<br><br>
