            Please note that this is my first submission to epinions, so be gentle but please give feedback as I appreciate it very much and want to improve.

In 1995 I wanted to purchase a new car as I had come into a little money when I switched jobs and at age 45 I felt entitled to a little more car than I had allowed myself before.  However, years of frugality weren't going to just go away so I needed to find a compromise between luxury and economy.  Fortunately I found everything I needed in my 1993 Camry Sedan. Last month I traded it in after putting 150,000 miles on it and I miss it already.

I had driven Toyota pick-ups and Tercels prior to this and was always pleased with Toyota durability and fuel economy.  What I found with the Camry was that I sacrificed nothing in terms of durability, a little fuel economy, and gained immensely in comfort and luxury.  There is little if any difference between a nice Camry and a low-end Lexus, except for the sticker price.  My car had electric doors and windows, air, cruise, and enough space to fit four adults quite comfortably.

In my 5 years I never made an exceptional repair to the car.  It needed brakes and tires and batteries but even at a 30,000 mile a year pace, nothing broke down that wasn't regular wear and tear.  I broke down and now bought a small SUV but if I ever go back to cars, trust me it will be a Camry.

Thank you for checking out my writing and I hope to see you back here again.<br><br>
