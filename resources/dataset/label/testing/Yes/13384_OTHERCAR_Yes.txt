            My '93 Cavalier, until it's recent untimely demise at the hands of a reckless driver was the best car I have ever owned.  I bought it used in 1998 and while it always kind of smelled like the old man who owned it before I did, It was a great car.  I'm on the tall side at 6' but despite that, the seat was extremely comfortable.  My fevorite thing about the car would have to be the steering.  Hands down, the most comfortable car I've EVER driven.  The steering wasn't too loose nor was it too tight.  The acceleration was nice and in 3 years, the only repair it ever needed was a new radiator... but I knew that when I bought it.  The stereo system wasn't bad-standard radio/tape deck and a HUGE glove compartament... for all my stuff.  The trunk was also deciptively large.  The only bad thing about the car was the back seat.  When I drove, I had to push the seat ALL the way back and lean it back also.  There was no way anyone could have sat behind me.  Then again, not having to drive a million people around in your car isn't necessairly a bad thing.  Despite the love I had for this car, a lawbreaking woman decided to make an illegal U-Turn right into the front right side of me.  The impace carried both cars across 2 lanes of traffic and onto a sidewalk.  I was uninjured but the poor car was totaled.  On the plus side, the Cavilier was in better shape than the 98 BMW that hit it...good.  If you want to read about my adventures in insuranceland, you can go here:

If you don't, thats ok too, I just wanted to share the way I feel about this great reliable car.  It also got AMAZING gas mileage.
