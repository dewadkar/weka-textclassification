            I thought I would always drive a Grand Prix.  I recently purchased my first new car.  Anyone who has purchased a new car knows of all the trouble that goes into researching and looking at all the specs of a variety of different cars.  This search can be endless.  I looked at the Grand Prix, Grand Am, Mercury Cougar, Oldsmobile Alero, Monte Carlo and the Volkswagon series just for giggles.

I decided to go with the 2000 Impala.  I feel that this was the best choice.  It is a great car, good engine, and a meaty body which mixes the feel of a BMW (in the headlights) and the girth of an American car.

I had narrowed down the choices to the Impala and the Monte Carlo.  I went with the Impala because they both had the same engine, but I really liked the body of the Impala.

I did not love it immediately.  I was pretty much unimpressed with the taillights.  I thought they just did not fit the car.  I still don't love them, but when I see another Impala from the rear, I almost go into a trance when I see the ominousness of the bold circles.

Of all the colors that it comes in, I feel that the 2000 Impala looks most impressive in Silver.  It has a feeling of class.

I lucked out in my model and got bucket seats.  I bought the sedan model (not the LS which comes with a spoiler).  The sedan model typically comes with a 60/40 bench seat.  In the bench-seat version, the cup holder is rather flimsy and looks like it would either break or spill coffee all over the front seat.  Also, in the bucket seat model, it has a floor shifter, which gives it a feeling of power.  I guess I just like floor shifters after driving a Grand Prix for about a decade.

I was a little upset that the sedan model did not come with standard ABS brake system.  I feel that this is an important safety piece to any car.  This should be standard in all cars.
