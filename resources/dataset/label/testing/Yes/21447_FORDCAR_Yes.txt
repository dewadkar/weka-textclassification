            I was in the market for a new car in 02/1997.  I had a 1988 Ford Escort with 288,000 miles and I knew it was a matter of time before it went to heaven.  I stumbled onto an ad in the paper for a Ford Aspire for $189.00 per month.  I drove to the Ford dealer to look at this car I have never heard of.  Of course they did not have the one I wanted.  I looked at another one.  It was a 2dr White, 5spd tranny, and AC.  I test drove the car and loved it.  I bought that car.  Now, I have 47,000 miles on it and it is still going strong.  I have had no major problems with the car.  I sure as hell cannot complain about the 30+ miles per gallon.  With these current gas prices, $10.00 fills it up.

I love the low Maintenance that the car requires.  I love the fact that the upkeep is low because of the price and the car.  I think the gas mileage is great.  It has enough pep to get me around town.  Some people have left opinions about the power of the engine.  LOOK.. It is a 1.3 liter engine with about 80hp.  WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU EXPECT?

It is not the most comfortable thing in the world.  They say it it will sit 4 people.  OK... four kids maybe.  There is not a lot of room in the car.  If it is only a couple it would be a great car.

A family with one small child would benefit from this car.  If there is any other things like pets or multiple children you may want to avoid this car.  I would recommend it.

Another quick note.... I love mine so much I purchased another one for a close friend.<br><br>
