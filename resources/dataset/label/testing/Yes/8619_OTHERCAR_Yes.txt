            When I was looking for a new van in 2001, I got my chance to drive an Odyessy rather unexpectedly.  Most dealers had a long waiting list for the van and there just weren't many on the lots to test drive.

One dealer I called had just received an unannounced shipment which contained one van that had not been pre-ordered and it was going onto the lot. It hadn't even been taken off the transport trailer yet.  They told me to give them an hour and they would clean it up and have it ready for me to test drive.

We jumped into our car and headed over to the lot on Airport Motor Mile in Alcoa, Tennessee.  When we got there, a new, dark gray van was sitting out front of the dealership. 

It lacked that 'come hither' look of some of the other van
with it's sharp, boxy lines. It looked 'big' just sitting there in comparison to the Toyota, Ford, and Chrysler products.  It reminded more of the General Motors products, with their rectangular boxes and little curb appeal.

We took it for about a 15 minute test drive. I drove first and half way through the test, swapped out with my wife.

The van had a 210 hp motor which compared with the motor in the Toyota, but the Toyota's pep throughout it's full torque range was much better.  The Honda takes more effort to get going from a dead stop, but once it's up to road speed, it seemed to perform as well as the Toyota.  The ride was stiffer than the Toyota and I didn't find the seats as comfortable as those of the Sienna Van.  I know 15 minutes is not much time to make comparisons, but that's about the same amount of time I drove a Sienna before deciding on it over all other vans.

After my wife and I swapped positions, I sat in the middle and back row of seats.  Leg room was good in both cases, but I felt some slight body roll on curves (we were driving a back country, two lane road) and when I moved to the rear row of seats, the body roll was even more noticeable.  I guess that's really what decided me on the Toyota.  We had driven that same road test driving a Toyota from another dealership just down the road, and the Toyota hugged that stretch of road like it had suction cups under it.  Solid as a rock.  

After the test drive, we checked on pricing.  Honda's came fully equipped, in two models, the $24,000 MSRP and $28,000 MSRP versions.  Toyota offered extras that were not included in the price, but were with the Honda. But...I am a member of a Credit Union which offers 'haggle free, best price' shopping at many local dealerships, of which this dealership was one.  Accordingly, I was supposed to get the absolute, rock bottom price available from the dealer.  I had told the dealer up front that I was a CU member, but when I checked on the price...it didn't appear to matter. The demand for the vehicle was so great in 2001 that dealerships could ask what they wanted and get it.  This was the $24,000 model but I wouldn't have been able to buy for less than $3000 more than MSRP!  So...I would have been paying for the options anyway!

I got my Toyota pretty much loaded, it's an LX with a base price (MSRP in 2001 of $28,360 before options) and by doing my research and haggling, I got my options basically free.  I bought the Sienna for $28,500.

Of all the other vans I drove, I'd probably put the Honda second, very slightly ahead of the Ford and then all the rest. 

Bottom line?  It just comes down to personal preference and what you are willing to go through to buy a vehicle.  Honda is a good name and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good value with better than average resale value.  Of course, my choice is the Toyota.
