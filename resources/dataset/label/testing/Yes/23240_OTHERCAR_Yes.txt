            Wow, what a great car - on the outside.  The Mitsubishi 3000GT is one of my favorite body styles around.  Still, the 3000GT had too many problems.  The VR-4 Model's twin turbo engine can produce over 300 Ponies of power, but the base model is much too weak.  The VR-4 comes standard with leather and cd-player, the whole package.  But, did you know it comes with a Spoiler Control Option?  This feature actually allows the driver to raise and lower the spoiler to create more or less wind resistance!  Pretty cool huh?  In Addition, you may control your exhaust as well!  You can use both pipes for added power and sound, or just one for a smoother, quieter ride.  

The problem is that all these options don't mean squat if you're transmission breaks down!  THAT, is just what happened to the base and VR-4 models.  Mitsubishi had to recall all the 3000GT's in order to fix this defect, which was not as evident in the Manual-Shift models.  

I like the 3000GT's shape and design, but the fact of the matter is, for the price you pay, you should get car without the worries!  

One question to everyone, don't you think the marketing committee over looked a great chance to boost profits simply by calling it the 2000GT?  I mean we did just enter the millenium...why not call it the Millenium Car by naming it 2000GT instead?  Oh well, what do I know?  

For anyone who ownes this car - I love the car - no doubt, but good luck in case of needed repairs - they're COSTLY!  I know, I had the eclipse!<br><br>
