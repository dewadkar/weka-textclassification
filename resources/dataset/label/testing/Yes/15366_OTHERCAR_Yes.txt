            The Sony MVC-FD83 Digital Camera is, without question, the best camera I have ever had.  Moments ago I retrieved my Sony camera from the closet because I'm using it today.  In fact, I use it many days - more than any other camera I've owned.

It dawned on me that I need to tell you guys about it - at least, those of you who do not have one, or those of you who are planning to purchase one as a Christmas gift.

Last year I needed a good camera prior to going on vacation.  I was heading out west to the Canadian Rockies from my home in North Carolina. Therefore, I needed a good camera, knowing there exists a possibility that I may not take that trip again.

When I purchased my Sony Digital Camera I'd looked at so many cameras I became totally confused as to what brand and exactly what type of camera I wanted.  Finally, I reached the point of thinking to myself, &quot;Make a decision, even if it's wrong.&quot;  

At that point I picked out the Sony MVC-FD83 Digital Camera. Folks . . . that decision was not a mistake.  I wish you could see some of the photos I took while in Canada, especially photos I captured of Lake Louise. My digital camera picked up the Rocky Mountains as reflected in the lake - absolutely breathtaking shots.  

When I returned home, I resized a photo of Lake Louise, printed it out, and then had it matted and framed.  When people see it on my wall they can hardly believe that the photo was taken from my camera.  

There you have an example. To go further, this camera has a lot of character.  It comes with a floppy disk drive, and it has an automatic 'built-in' flash.  Additionally, this unique camera has a MPEG movie mode.  

It is a 'high-speed' camera that develops high quality photos, which will load right into your computer.  They can be sized and resized, and then placed into your e-mail to friends or simply printed out for you to show off.  

I continue to be excited with this camera. Do you know how it is when we make purchases at times?  We often tire of the purchase after a brief period of time - not so with this Sony Digital Camera.  

I feel excited every single time I need to capture a photo. I never have to worry about whether the photo will come out okay.  I know it WILL, because I can view it within a few seconds. The color and sharpness of each picture is 'real.'

After taking several photos, you are only 'one-click-at-a-time' away from viewing the slides you just placed on your floppy disk . . . simply another fantastic option.  There are many more.  

I recommend that you trade your film in for floppy disks, and then enjoy one of the best camera's constructed.  Additionally, I'd purchase the accessory kit, because that'll give you an extra battery with longer life than the original one. Also, you'll have absolutely everything you need, including the case.  

I have a couple of friends that unnerve me at times, as our buddies can do.  When they take vacation they want to use my camera.  I think that says it all, don't you?  

I surely hope both buddies get a Sony Digital Camera for Christmas this year. And, that goes for you, too, if you don't already have one. Make it a gift from you to you. You'll be glad that you did.<br><br>
