            We adore our 1998 Bonneville, and it just continues to get better with age. There are few if any surprise (hidden) ownership costs, the fuel economy is excellent as is the performance of the 3800 series II V6, that has the get up an go that most V-6's lack. The handling is superior and the body sporty yet stylish. A conservative sport sedan  at the least, and a car that speaks for its self. One is sold upon it by looks alone, but after a drive the fact that the Bonneville is a requirement for the sport sedan lover. Family values, comfort and quality all packaged in a safe reliable, value(quality) driven vehicle, backed by the Pontiac 'Excitement' is an understatement. Finally a style that one wishes to hold onto as they step forward into the next generation of Bonneville (2000 model year beginning), yet want to keep one of the ones owned from 1992-1999, to keep and have in the garage as well. For saying good-bye to the 92-99 generation would be a regret.
