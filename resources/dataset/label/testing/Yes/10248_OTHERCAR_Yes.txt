            This has everything you are looking for in a sports car,great body shape,spoiler control which can be activated to give you better handling when your giving it some gas round those bends,exhaust option which gives you the option of quiet drive or the louder drive with more power.
With the 300bhp and the twin turbo this is not a car for the fainthearted,although not very fast of the mark once into 2nd gear this car is 2nd to none.
this car is the nicest,smoothest and fastest car i've had the pleasure of owning,the vr4 handles the road really well especially with the 4 wheel drive,its a real comfort to drive ,even though there is not to much room in the back,but who cares i'm driving.
i also found that the car wasn't to bad for gas mileage.
the problem with this car is that i think there has been a few engineering problems,which i have found out are all to common,especially the transmission and the turbo,the price for repairs on this car are very high,so anybody buying one of these should take into account any problems are gonna hit you in the pocket,also it helps if you have a perfect driving record as insurance isn't cheap either
But overall this car was great while i had it,and anybody thinking of buying one should take advantage of a beautiful drive.
