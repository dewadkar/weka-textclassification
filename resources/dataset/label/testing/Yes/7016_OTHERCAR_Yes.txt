            The Olds Silhouette is a good smooth driving, good looking 
vehicle.  We would buy another one, but would consider 
putting in my own battery and buying better tires.

We like our Silhouette, but are disgusted with GM for the inferior quality accessories.  In less than 18 months, we have had to replace the tires and the battery.  I have been driving for over 35 years and have never had this kind of luck with tires or a battery.  Within a two week period when the car was 15 months old and had approximately 25,000 miles on it, I had problems with 3 different tires.  The first time I replaced only the single tire.  When the second tire went flat, I asked the Goodyear dealer to check all of my tires.  At that time he found and identified to me, the damage suffered by that tire, as well as a second tire.  My only choice was to replace the remaining tires.  So at that point I had replaced all 4 tires on my vehicle.  In all of my years I have had very few problems with tires, and particularly when they were relatively new.  The Goodyear dealer told me that these were inferior quality tires.  I would have to agree with him.  Then in our month 18 of our vehicle's life, we started noticing some electrical problems.  We were not carrying our charge in the battery:  Plus we were having lighting problems, as if the switches were shorting out.  We took this to our Olds dealer and he told us that our battery was leaking and had leaked acid on some of our wiring. Of course, none of this was covered by our extended warranty that we had purchased.  When I checked into the history of problems with Oldsmobile vehicles,I found that most of their tires and batteries must be replaced relatively early in their life.  Obviously Olds purchases large lots of very inferior products to put into their new vehicles.  This angers me and that is why I am writing.  We like the Silhouette, and will likely replace this one with another.  But, if we do, I will time it so that I can keep the tires and the battery on my current vehicle.  I don't want any more of their sub-quality products in my car.<br><br>
