            We are very pleased with our Saturn.  The service is the best we have ever recieved and are very well pleased.  They always return the car to us clean both inside and out.  The car has very comfortable seating and I have long legs.  The only problem I have is getting in and out.  The car is low to the ground and I have arthritis.  When I get out it takes a little more effort than I would like and the same goes for getting in.  The engine is quiet running.  I would have preferred to have the automatic climate control - where you set a desired temp and the computer automatically choose the air conditioning mode.  
Gas consumption is a real plus - we get about 32 miles to a gallon and with the increase in the cost of gas this is a real value!  We had a truck that got 5 to 12 miles per gallon and preferred supreme (pulled a 5th wheel trailer).  The gas we use is regular unleaded and that really helps the pocket.<br><br>
