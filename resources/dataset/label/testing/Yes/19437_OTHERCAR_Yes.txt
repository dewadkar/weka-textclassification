            The CRV is a well designed mini SUV with a lot of features not included with all vehicles such as the picnic table and extra power outlet.  It is fun to drive and surprisingly roomy inside, especially when compared with the other vehicles in its class such as the RAV4 and Isuzu.  Head and legroom all over is sufficient, as are storage compartments.  It is a spectacular car for everyday use, as well as in snow with the 4 wheel drive capabilities.
What dealers may not mention is that the CRV is built on the chassis of a Honda Civic, and is not something to be used for any off roading, including mud or sand.  The ground clearance does not permit for challenging or rocky terrain, and neither does the 4 cylinder engine.  So if you are interested in a mini SUV for mild snowy weather and running around town, this vehicle makes a good choice.  If you are into rougher conditions or serious off roading- don't waste your time.<br><br>
