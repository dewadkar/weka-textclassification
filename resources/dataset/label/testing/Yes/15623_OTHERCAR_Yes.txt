            The Sony Mavica FD-91 is a good camera...depending on what you want to use it for.

If you want a digital camera for proffessional, super-high quality photographs, the FD-91 may not be for you.  It takes poor quality photographs in low-light areas.  The 1024x768 resolution pictures come out worse than the 640x480 resolution photos which come out quite well.  The Mavica FD-91 is better at close-up shots than it is at far away shots.  It can only record a maximum of 60 seconds worth of video, for any more than that could not fit on a single floppy disk (which is what the FD-91 uses to record onto).  The FD-91 is imperfect when it comes to picking up the exact color of things, requiring that you fool around with the white-balance settings if you want the colors to be perfect.  Also, the LCD screen that lets you preview your photographs sometimes shows the pictures different than the way they really look on the computer.

However, if you are looking for a digital camera for personal to semi-proffessional use, I recommend the FD-91.  It takes good-enough quality shots for my semi-proffessional needs.  The FD-91 has a great feature that steadies the shot, if your hands are shaking slightly (which can be turned on or off).  It has manual and auto focus.  You can take pictures anywhere, for all you have to do is pop a standard floppy disk into the camera and you can record without wires or connections of any kind.

So it's really up to you to decide whether the Sony Mavica FD-91 is the right camera for you.  I highly recommend that you go to a computer store, like CompUSA, to try out the camera and make sure that it fits your needs.<br><br>
