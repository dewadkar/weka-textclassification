            I bought my 1995 VW Jetta used this past summer with 31,000 miles.  I got a great deal, and it seemed like a dream.  I have no real complaints.  Granted, there was a hole above the tailight and water came in the trunk and then the rear floorboards, and then the front ones eventually.  
    It's a zippy car and it moves decent with the 4-cylinder engine, and it handles pretty well for it's size.  But the real complaint I have with the car is the gas mileage.  Granted it's all city miles, but I get barely 200 miles to the tank and that's the worst fuel economy I've ever gotten, and I owned an 8-cylinder full size GMC pickup truck.  
     Would I buy this car again?  Probably.  It handles well in the snow, as I know being that I live in NYC.  The radio and all the dials are well placed.  The seat controls take a little getting used to, but once you know how to use them, it's not a problem.  
      But upgrade to the 2000 Jetta.  For one, there's no glove compartment in my car, because apparently the German guys couldn't figure out the airbag and the glovebox too.  Oh, and get it with ABS. It's way worth it.
