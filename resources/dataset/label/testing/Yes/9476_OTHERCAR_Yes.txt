            Never thought I'd own a pick-up truck, but I just got a 97 Dodge Ram 1500 Extended Cab, and I love it.  I started out shopping for a new Dodge Dakota Club Cab, but ended up test driving a RAM.  Why drive a little Dakota, when you can drive a RAM?

I didn't give up any passenger room with the extended cab.  I had five passengers last week, and they all gave me a thumbs up in the room and comfort category.  I also got the hard cover on the back, and it's like having a huge trunk.  The cover comes off easily too, if I have to haul something big.

The truck has run extremely well thus far: powerful V8, smooth ride, and excellent in snow with 4X4.  It's also nice that it's loaded with all powers, air conditioning, CD stereo, etc.

If I had to come up with a negative, it's the gas guzzling 22 gallon tank.  With gas prices at 1.50+, I'm bucking up over $30 a week.

I've heard a lot of people talk up Ford trucks over Dodge trucks, but I haven't had a problem yet.  Dodge trucks are definitely cooler looking, but I just hope that the performance and reliability are the reasons why I have this truck for the next 10+ years.
