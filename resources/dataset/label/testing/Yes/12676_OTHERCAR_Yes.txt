            In October 1996, I bought a new '97 metallic green 2-door Cavalier, &quot;Rally Sport&quot; model.  3 1/2 years later, I am still as happy with the car as the day I bought it.  I have about 32,000 miles on it and the car still runs as good as it did when it was new.  Aside from routine maintenance, the only item that has needed to be fixed at the dealer was a front passenger seat that no longer slid forward.  In fact, aside from oil changes and stuff like that, the only &quot;expensive&quot; maintenance the car has needed has been brakes.

There are a few very minor things I do not like about the car.  But let me just say that none of these are significant enough for me not to have bought the car.  (1) The power window buttons are on the center console instead of the door.  I can't tell you how many people have mistaken the power lock button on the door for the window.  I think the window buttons should have been placed on the door.  (2) You cannot open the trunk using the keyless remote while the engine is on.  Even if the car is in park, you must still turn off the engine to &quot;pop&quot; the trunk.  This is annoying.  (3) It is difficult to see where the back of the car ends when you are backing up.  This makes parallel parking difficult.  Other than that, there is really nothing I would change about the car.  (4) The &quot;Rally Sport&quot; writing on the side of the car is a bit goofy looking, especially since its purple.  

The Rally Sport comes with a moon roof.  After having a moon roof, I can safely say that I will never buy another car without one.  I love it.

The fuel economy is considered &quot;good&quot;, I guess.  I get in the high 20s.

I would definitely recommend this car and would probably buy another one if I wasn't ready for a slightly larger car for my next car.<br><br>
