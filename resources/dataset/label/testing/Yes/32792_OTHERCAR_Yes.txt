            The chevrolet Corvette is what dreams are made of. Reasonably priced at 45 to 55,000 Us makes it one of the best values for a car. My dad recently bought a dark silver 2000 corvette convertible. Its a 5 speed manual with a lot of kick. Features included, 5 deck cd player,  AM/FM radio with bose stero system pumping out 350 watts, Air conditioner, Automatic door opener and many more features that I can't think of. If you are in a mid life crisis or just feel the need for a new hot car this is the one for you!   <br><br>
