            The BMW 740il is, I have to say, the greatest car I've owned.  With its GPS system, you can get anywhere without having to ask for directions (not like most of us do anyway,) and the ride is incredible.  With tons of room in the back for my kids, there are never any complaints about sitting in front--because the back has just as much leg room as the front!  The heated steering wheel and seats make this car absolutely incredible to ride in.  The stereo system in this car is incredible also.  If you turn up the volume too far, don't be surprised to have a ringing in your ears for quite a while afterwards.  Definitely recommended for all.<br><br>
