            digital camera's are the new way to take pictures. if you didnt know digital camera's dont take film. you could easily delete and add pictures simply by connecting the digital camera to your computer. some digital camera's are clear and some take the worst picture ever! make sure you dont go out and buy one for $100 dollars because its the cheapest one out! you should ask the guy on his opinon and then ask to see some sample photos! i know when i got mine i went wrong and i bought the one that was $250 and the picture is very blurry.. if you want to print out these pictures then plan on spending over 500 dollars on a good quality printer.. these pictures look very bad on bad printers.<br><br>
