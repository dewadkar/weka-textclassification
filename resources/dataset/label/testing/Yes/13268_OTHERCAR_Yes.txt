            Our first Honda...why did we wait so long? We bought our Honda Accord EX Sedan, black with leather interior, in June of 1999, and I can't remember what it was like without it. I should've known. My brother has bought an Accord twice, several people at work drove them, and all I ever heard was great things about this car. When we were in the market for a new car last year, I knew I was getting an Accord with automatic transmission. No matter what my wife said, I was getting it. And it was going to be black.

So, 6 months later here I am, adoring this car. It drives so smoothly, I rarely feel any bump or nick on the road. It handles really well at all speeds, and gets fairly good gas mileage. After driving cars with standard transmission since I got my driver's license at 16, I finally experienced driving with one hand free, just in case. I love the &quot;extras&quot; that come with this car, such as the sunglasses holder, cup holders (all 4 of them), power outlet. I couldn't have asked for a better car.

So off I go, sunroof open, happy as can be, muttering &quot;I love this car...&quot; while my 6-1/2 year old daughter sarcastically answers from the back seat, &quot;then why don't you marry it?&quot;
