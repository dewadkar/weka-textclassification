            I've owned this tiny camera for less than a week and have bonded quickly. Potential photographs are where you find them, often at unexpected moments. It is great to have a quality 3.2 megapixel camera in a leather over-size business card case (bought separately by my lovely wife) in my pants pocket, ready for use at any beckoned moment!

Last week-end's 'around-town' scene shots were of the quality I'm used to when I use my other camera (which is made by Nikon). I'm taking flash shots of people at my place of business this week and expect to be totally pleased when I review them this week-end on my computer. 

The only resolution I have used so far is the highest one on the camera. There is not any appreciable delay for the image to be recorded onto the 128 MB SD card which I'm using. I get 61 high resolution images on that card.

I haven't installed the accompanying software yet since I use a multi-card reader to transfer pic's. I will say that the ACDSee viewing program (which I understand comes with the camera) is nothing short fabulous in user-friendliness and sensible features. I already have this software and use it to organize and sort my images.

If you're not afraid of having a camera that is so small and portable that it might be easy to misplace, I highly recommend purchasing one of these. It's an absolute marvel how much technology can be packed into such a small package!
