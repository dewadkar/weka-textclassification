            The Maxima competes in a tough market segment.The other cars in its category are the Mitsubishi Galant (too under powered), Honda Accord (very reliable but bland handling), Toyota Camry ( great power, under stated) and the Mazda 626. Out of this lot the maxima is the most sporty in nature with  potential to grow. It has good power and tight handling right out of the box. 

The maxima comes in 3 trim levels. The base model (called the GXE (around $18 K). The GLE (lux package around 22 K ) and the SE (Sports package at 25.5 K). My car is the SE with a 5 speed.The first order of business when i got the car was to improve handling and braking then more power in 99.

Stillen and Jim Wolf Technology are the largest suppliers of after market parts for nissans. You can get body kits, suspension upgrades and superchargers that bump up the hp to 300 +. More than enough to roast the tires. Adding the suspension and power packages makes the car untouchable by sports sedans costing much more. I am now able to beat a stock M3 with ease in a straight line.

In my opinion the biggest drawback to the maxima is its bland styling. Luckily there is enough after market support to cure that. Reliability is decent but not as good as the Honda or the Camry. I have had to replace the passenger side CV joint , the shocks (upgrade) and small bits and bobs in the 70 K miles that i have had the car. THe engine is a jewel. No problems there whatsoever. My car was a SE trim and had a 5 speed which has been near perfect. Slightly notchy but still shifts good. Adding the supercharger killed the clutch in no time but that would be expected. An upgraded Jim Wolf Technology clutch holds the power no problem.

All in all i'm happy with my maxima. I will probably buy the 2001 version as a 1 year used car next year.
