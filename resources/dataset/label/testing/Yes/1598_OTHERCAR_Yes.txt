            With all the negative reviews that the Geo Prizm seem to be getting around my hometown, I decided to write about my Prizm.  

I bought my first Prizm in 1995.  It was a Champagne colored Lsi.  I love to &quot;drive&quot; so I got the 5-speed manual transmission.  It was everything you could wish for in a car.  I got 40 to 45 mpg  on the highway, 38 in the city.  Then, on one May evening, my car got beat to and early grave by softball size hail.  My insurance company totaled it within 5 minutes of viewing it, but then, they totaled many that day.

The very next day I called the dealer I purchased the car from and asked if they had another one.  They only had one 1995 on the lot, and it was a tropical green color.  I didn't care about the color, I just wanted another Prizm.  I made the 250 mile trip, picked up my new Prizm and drove happily off the lot.

My car has 87k miles on it now, and will become my daughter's car this summer.  She has already started babying it.  I just remind her that the oil needs changed every 3000 miles with quality motor oil, and the tires need checked and aired up, if necessary, on a weekly basis.  She can't wait till it's hers completely! And yes, you guessed it, my next car will be the new and improved Chevrolet Prizm!

Now for some bad news.  Valentine's Day I sent my daughter to the store to purchase some items.  While at the store, she met up with a couple of friends who needed a ride. While taking them to their car, my daughter had stopped at an intersection on the outside edge of town.  This road meets the highway coming into our home town.  Approximately 100 yards from this intersection is a sign that states, reduced speed ahead, 40 mph.  My daughter stopped at the sign, did the usual left, right left checking and proceeded across the intersection.  She was approximately 5 feet into the intersection when the other girls noticed a van, traveling west and  started yelling for my daughter to stop.  She didn't have enough time.  She hit the front left quarter panel of the van with the complete front end of the car.  The air bags did not deploy, and luckily, no one in either vehicle was hurt.  However, my car is totaled.  I looked at the front of my car for about 30 minutes, noticing that the engine was pushed back, but not through the firewall of the car.  It seems to smash in a downwards motion, not back like would have expected it to.  I still don't understand why the bags did not deploy.  Surely it was God looking out for my daughter and her two friends that day.  I am not sure, right now if I will be purchasing another Prism, I know I will try to purchase a GM product.  I do know however, that young people aren't quite ready to drive, with their friends in the car.  My daughter had well over 200 hours of driving time.  The state of Kansas only recommends 50.  I say, don't let them go with anyone but adults and 200 hours is still not enough time behind the wheel.  <br><br>
