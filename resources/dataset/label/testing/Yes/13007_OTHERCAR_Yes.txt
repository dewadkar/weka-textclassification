            I purchased this camera a few days ago so I cannot comment on the durability of it. However, everything has been working great up to this point. 

Pros:

The first thing that struck me about the A60 was the compact size and look. The camera housing is very solid, and even the battery cover has spring hinges to give it that expensive feel.

The picture quality looks very good and the LCD screen is bright and clear, perfect for framing and reviewing pictures. Almost everything can be adjusted on this camera manually including:

Focus, aperture, ISO (measurement of film speed even though the medium is actually digital), shutter speed, flash intensity, digital zoom, picture viewing style, sound levels and LCD display.

There are even two types of auto focus, one that uses the center point for focus and one that uses multiple points.  The video function works well although the audio recorded is less than desirable (I was just glad to have audio recording). When off, the camera automatically pulls in the lens and shuts the lens cover for protection. Also, the actual LCD screen is behind glass which makes it easier to wipe off finger prints and dust.

For any fellow E-bay users out there, the camera has both a macro feature and 3x optical zoom, which is everything you need for taking photos. I also anticipate using this camera a great deal the next time I go on a trip. There are a plethora of shooting options, but being a control freak, I like going full manual.

Cons:

Most of my complaints don't really bother me, but it might annoy somebody else considering a digital camera.

The A60 does drain batteries quickly as most digital cameras do. The zoom control is a swiveling ring (I prefer buttons), and the camera goes into shutdown mode faster than I would like it to.  The automatic shooting settings are not very good for indoor low light conditions, but since I go manual, this is not a big issue for me.

Don't mean to sound like a Canon salesperson, but other than that,  I think the camera performs quite well. Of course, a professional photographer will want something more high-end, but the camera seems perfect for the average consumer.
