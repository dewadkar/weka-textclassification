            I bought my Chevy S-10 Blazer for a bargain $6000.  The miles were a little high, but with Chevy, you don't need to worry too much about that.  The blazer has a great engine, is easy to repair, and comfortable.  However, watch for electrical problems and annoying rattles.

The '93 is the second to last year for the old box-like style.  The engine is the 4.3 vortec.  This used to be optional, but now Chevy uses this motor in its newer vehicles.  The vortec provides the kick that the blazer thrives on.  The gas pedal is extremely touchy and lead foots are no longer needed to go way over the speed limit.  Also, the 6 cylinder engine will last way over 100,000 miles.  It's reliable and I guarantee that other parts will need replaced before an engine rebuild is even a thought.  As for parts other than the engine, take care of your blazer and it will take you anywhere.  All it needs is a little TLC. 

Repairs on the blazer are quite simplistic.  The only big problem repair I have had is the fuel pump.  It's a tedious job that requires time and patience.  Parts are easy to find though.  For the '93's most parts can be dated as far back as '88.    

My blazer's seats are quite comfortable.  They are easy to adjust and there is plenty of leg room.  The back seat is not tilted back enough for my liking, but it's nice to sleep on.  And, even with the seats back, backseat riders still have enough room to manuever and be comfortable.
 
I do have issues with my windshield wipers.  They wipe whenever they want to.  I have no control of them.  They can be off and start wiping in the bright sunshine.  It's an electrical problem that I'm not going to take the time to fix.  It's not worth it.  Everything else is fine.  The power locks and windows work well and so does the heater.  

My other problem is the rattles.  My driver's side window rattles, but I think that whoever owned this vehicle before me had the window replaced and it wasn't done quite right.  My back window rattles a lot too.  One of the problems is that the rubber thing to cease the racket is missing.  It fell off.  To correctly replace it, I need to replace the whole window.  Like the windshield wipers, I'm just going to live with it.
