            The introduction of the Aurora was long-awaited at General Motors, and at Oldsmobile. The car was very stylish in '95, and still is today. 

The Northstar V8 is phenominal, though the gas mileage isn't award-winning. It delivers a healthy 250 HP and 260 foot-pounds of torque, transferred to the ground via a 4-speed automatic transmission. Many probelems take place under the hood, however, such as the fuel rail broke, something that Oldsmobile admitted should never break in a car. I should also mention that the car hasn't had any problems for nearly 6 months now. 

The interior has a huge dose of electronic bells & whistles, such as power everything and a little computer that displays the amount of miles to your destination, the current outside temp,etc. Overall, the interior is very nice, though tall drivers will find it difficult to see, due to a low roofline. 

This car's chassis is overall pretty good, though the suspension is a little soft, making for a lot of body roll in corners, and the car doesn't have good handling anyhow.

If you have a family and want to get from point A to point B, with a little more pizzaz, then this car is for you, if you don't mind periodic repairs.
