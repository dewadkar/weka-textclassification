            The moment I hopped into my Jetta to take a test drive, I was hooked.  I was looking for a reliable, nimble car that would be so much fun to drive I wouldn't mind the payments!  I found the car, it's my Jetta.
My wife is sick of hearing how much I love my car.  The gas milage is respectable, 30-31 mpg...the handling is the thing I like most about my car.  It's just plain fun to drive.  My next car will be a Jetta, I can guarantee it.
Before I bought it, I took a look at the Honda Accord, and the Subaru Outback.  I like both of them...but I didn't get the feeling that they were &quot;me&quot;...I get that in my Jetta.
The German word for &quot;driving pleasure&quot; is Fahrfergnugen...I think that's what Jetta translates into also.<br><br>
