            A good recreational camera, the PhotoPC 700 is beginning to show it's age as new products, specifically offerings from Kodak and Nikon and even newer Epson models come down in price.

A year ago now, when this camera first hit the store shelves, it was the clear price to performance winner. The picture quality is consistent and sharp and more than adequate for everyday snapshots for posting on a website or in a group newsletter.

The camera ships with a set of 4 rechargeable batteries and a charger, all the cables necessary to hook up to your computer, and an easy to use suite of software to download and edit your images.

The camera is a breeze to use. The interface is quite simple, and previewing the images, either in real time, or right after they've been taken is a single flick of a switch. The only feature on the camera that is difficult to use is the digital zoom. Enabling it requires the user to navigate through the digital menu and select among rather obscurely worded options. When I first enabled the zoom on my camera, I wasn't quite sure how it happened. Then, I was unable to return to the menu to disable it and ended up simply pulling the batteries from the camera to reset it. But let's face it, digital zooms kinda suck anyway.

I've had this particular camera now for over a year and have taken several thousand images with it. The images have been consistent since the first snapshot, and the camera has withstood more than a few accidental beatings and droppings with no ill effect.

My only real complaint about the camera arises when I compare it to newer or pricier models. The image quality, for example, when stacked up against  the Nikon Coolpix offerings, appears washed out and blue. High-contrast details break apart slightly at the lowest resolution setting, though use of the integrated flash seems to help. 

The camera also has the typical button-pressing delay associated with most digital models. Press the button, take a breath, then the camera snaps. It takes a bit to get used to if you've been using a traditional film camera, but anticipating the shot becomes second nature after a few hundred shots.

All in all, this camera was a great offering from Epson when it was new, but with newer, more advanced models being released and the price on the more expensive competitors dropping everyday, I find it difficult to recommend this as a new purchase.

If, however, you happen to find one used on an auction and the price is right, snap it up. Just make sure they send you the batteries.<br><br>
