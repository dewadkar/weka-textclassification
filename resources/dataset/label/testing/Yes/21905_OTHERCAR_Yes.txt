            My friend just got his BMW 525i, it is sooooo awesome..I thought I was always a huge Mercedes fan..But that all changed July 23, 2001. The 525i (2001 530i)spells quality, the dash materials are flawless, the seats are sooooo posh and soft, the seat adjustments seem perfect. The hand polished burl walnut is flawlessly crafted. I love the burl walnut cover for the radio, it sorta hides it, a gr8 touch. 

The engine purrrrs like a cat when you step on the pedal, But the transmission responds quickly and smoothly.The manumatic in this car is fun, and operates perfectly, the driver is very involved, when shift gear, and the automatic transmission wont step in and shift if you forget to (Which most cars will automaticly shift so you don't ruin your transmission) . My friend and I were traveling down I-75, at about 90 MPH, I swore we going like 70 MPH, until I said "Why are you driving so slow?" "He said I am going 90 MPH." I looked at the speedomter, and it read 90 MPH.

The A/C in this car is colder than winter in Chicago..The heater is hotter than Florida in the summer.. 

The ride on this car is next to amazing, it doesn't have that floatly ride like Lexus. It doesn't let you know when there's a big pot hole either the suspension soaks it up with an Ablomb. The handling has this on center feel, the car feels heavy on turns, more like a Mercedes in Handling catagory. The steering wheel power adjusts when you put the key in the ignition, to the driver. When driving along on the highway there is not much wind noise picked upp from outside, very isolated inside the cabin. 

BMW service far outweigh's any Lexus, Mercedes, Audi dealers that I have been to. Very nice people friendly and helpful, get you in and out of the shop in a flash.
