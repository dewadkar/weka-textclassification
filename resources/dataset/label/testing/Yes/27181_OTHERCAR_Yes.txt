            I had purchased my New 2002 Toyota Sequoia back in March of 2002 as a new model.
It is the SR5 trim 4x4. It has everything except the heated leather seats, rear spoiler, and a in dash CD changer which the Limited trim comes standard with these features.

I prefer not to have leather seats since it can be uncomfortable durring the summer and winter months due to extreme weather conditions here in Michigan.

Back to my personal review...

The Good:
The ride is very good for this size SUV and takes on bumps pretty decent.
I would not suggest taking this vehicle or any other large SUV off road unless you really want to find out how expensive parts can get if you start breaking them due to extreme use.
Go buy a older Jeep or a smaller pickup truck for extreme off roading but for back roads this will handle any of them with no problems.

The inside is very spacious. I have a one year old baby we are very comfortable taking her in and out of the baby seat.

The gas mileage is awesome on such a large SUV. I get around 17-18 miles per gallon but most of my driving is on highways.

After putting 30,000 miles on this SUV I have had no problems with any mechanical or other problems I usually have with the Big Three cars or trucks.

Power is excellent and does the job to my needs. I have towed renting a Uhaul car transport with a 1976 Trans-Am with no problems and I normally tow a large 6x10 trailer almost every week hauling anything from my lawnmower to 1500 lbs of concrete or garbage.

The Stock JBL sound system is perfect for my needs. I'm not 18 years old anymore and do not need large amps and kickers to satisfy my musical needs.

The bad:

Its very large and my wife has problems parking sometimes.

When backing up make sure you untilize your side view mirrors since you will surely need them to see behind you.

The armrest located on the doors are not comfortable and could be larger and about even with the armrest on the chairs. I would of hoped that they would of placed seat mounted arm rests on both sides of the chairs.
