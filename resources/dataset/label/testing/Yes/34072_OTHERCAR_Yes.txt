            I bought my first Lincoln Mark VII in 1989.  It was an LSC and I was just knocked over by so many of the positives concerning the car.  I sold it 2 years later and regretted that move for years.  So when an opportunity to acquire a 1992 Bill Blass model recently presented itself, I couldn't refuse.  The car was from the original owner and had only 24,458 miles!!  Original factory tires (In good shape) garage kept and in impeccable condition.  I am in heaven again.  This car was so well kept, that I have had people think it is a new car!  Both the exterior and interior are actually scary that it is so "showroom new" looking.  The first thing to hit you is the incredible timeless body design.  Sleek, agressive and yet luxurious all at the same time.  White with a camel Faux Rag Top with a Moon/Sunroof and Camel leather interior.    The leather seating is incredibly comfortable.  Ideal for long trips.  It has a computer system that even by todays standards is "right there" and in many cases more advanced.  Solid feel, tight ride and oh so quiet.  Although it doesn't seem to have quite as good an engine response as my 1989 LSC, that's to be understood as the LSC was designed for more "kick" if you will.  It still is delightfully quick and responsive.  The rear seats are not an afterthought as so many cars today are want to have.  They are extremely comfortable.  This body design was an incredible winner for Lincoln when it was introduced.  Its forward looking AirBag leveling system was remarkable for its time as was the aforementioned onboard computer system.  You can't go wrong getting one of these if you can.
