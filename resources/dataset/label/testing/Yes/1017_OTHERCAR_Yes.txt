            The Dodge Intrepid 1998--want a sporty looking car, but need room for the family or friends?  Intrepid is the car for you.  Sporty looking, but fits five adults quite comfortably. There is plenty of room in the back seat even for a long legged adult.  The trunk is plenty roomy and lots of suitcases can be stored in it.  The ride is smooth and even and gas mileage around town is about 23 mpg, while on a highway trip you can expect to increase that significantly.  Contrary to what a popular magazine says, getting in and out of the Intrepid is not a problem, the doors are very wide.  The only drawback to the car is that the front seat cup holder is in the way of the driver and there are no cup holders in the back.  At about 25,000 miles the sensor on the transmission went, but that was easily fixed by the mechanic.  All in all the Dodge Intrepid is a very comfortable and stylish car.<br><br>
