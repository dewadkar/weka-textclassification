               I Bought my wife a Toyota Land Crusier in the winter of 1998 and the performance is incredible. Previously she drove a Lexus 470 and she loved it but we had to drive to Atlanta to get the oil changed and regular check ups so we sold it bought a Toyota  and loved it.  The performance of the car is great in every aspect. The only thing is, though it has great off-road, the price is so high that you will not want to take it off-road in fear of harming it. The on road driving is supurb and the ride is quiet. My wife likes the car because of the back seats and she can drive carpool and take the little ones around town. Though it is a great car I feel that is kind of unpracticle for a carpool car and I am planing on selling the car before it gets 50,000 miles on it. <br><br>
