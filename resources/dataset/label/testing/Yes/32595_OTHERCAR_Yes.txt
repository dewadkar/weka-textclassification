            We got a Saturn SL in 1997, it has been dependable and trustworthy as well as economical to maintain.  Saturn's service department gives us excellent service and their prices are fair.  Even when we have had problems with it they are repaired easily and with courtesy.  I do not think you can buy a car with all of the features like power windows and locks, with an alarm built right in for the price.  Every time I hear someone is in the market for a car I tell them to go look at Saturn.  Its even come to my attention that most of my friends have one, so when we go out as a group the parking lot looks like a Saturn Dealership. <br><br>
