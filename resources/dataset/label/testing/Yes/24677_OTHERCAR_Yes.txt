            We are family who lives to travel and so we need the extra room for all the things that help to keep a childs mind occupied while on the road. If room is what your asking for this is the van for you.  With the extended van there is plenty of space.  The seats that are in our venture are removable, so if you only want to take one to five seats out you can.  We have a basic vehicle without very many extras but when we looked at other vans the ventures basic package was much better.  It,s like getting a van with extras without out paying for them.  I have to add that we did have some problems in the beginning such as problems with the air and heating. The good thing is when we took it to be fixed the company repaired the problem quickly without any cost to us.  It is a comfort to have a vehicle that is nice to drive without a lot of worry and it gets good gas mileage.<br><br>
