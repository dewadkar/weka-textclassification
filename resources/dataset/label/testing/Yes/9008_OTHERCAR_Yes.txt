            I just bought a 2000 Kia Sportage and fell totally in love with it! I have been researching them for 2 years and finally had the means to acquire one. The price is SO reasonable! The basic features are enough to make you smile. Each Sportage comes with automatic door locks and auto windows, auto side-view mirrors also! You can get automatic transmission or 5-spd. I chose the automatic, and had them throw in a CD player instead of the optional cassette. I am not one for extravagance, so the alloy wheels weren't something that I wanted, especially not for the extra $1000 add-on to the price tag. The drive is smooth. Being built on a truck frame lowers the amount of jarring on bumps. I wanted a larger vehicle with more leg room in the back seat because I have two young boys. I GOT IT! It's not as big as the Ford Expedition, but it will do for a few more years. I love all the options. Acceleration is good for the size engine it has. If you can afford a payment of around $400 a month, then you too can own a Sportage! The only minor detail that I don't like is that they put the &quot;Hazard&quot; light switch too close to the ignition. I have bumped it a few times as I was turning off the vehicle. I liked this vehicle so much that I recommended it to my supervisor... and she bought one as well!
ADDENDUM 11/25/00: I have had my sportage for a year now, and wanted to share some of the problems I and a few others I know have had with this SUV. First notable is the brake dust. I thought this might be simply because the brakes were new, but after 12 months and 22,000 miles the brakes STILL shed a ton of dust and now they are squeaky, informing me that they will need replaced soon. 

With the SUV I purchased, I have had terrible problems with the door locks. First they wouldn't stay locked and the alarm kept going off. It has been to the shop 3 times for this, and each time they replace something else. IF it wasn't so far to drive to the nearest dealer, I'm sure it would be there more often! I have had the drawer in the console replaced as it wore out quickly. 

One of my co-workers purchased a Sportage and she has had a different variety of electrical problems. Hers has been to the shop 3 times also. My supervisor's only problems with hers is a defect in the gas hatch latch. At times it doesn't unhook and must be opened from inside the rear of the truck. She hasn't yet taken her to the shop. Also, her rotars are shaking during stopping. It shudders the whole vehicle and Kia has tried to tell her this was &quot;normal&quot; if the tires aren't rotated properly (she has rotated them as nec. per vehicle specs). 

Also, the personnel at the shops seem to be getting ruder (at least in the city I take mine to for repair). They hook it up to the machine and basically say &quot;If the computer says there is nothing wrong, then there is nothing we can do.&quot; I'm getting tired of it and am really ready to trade this lemon in for something else. Or at least get Kia to acknowledge that this IS a lemon and give me another truck.
