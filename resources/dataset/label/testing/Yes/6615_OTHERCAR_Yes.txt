            We have two vehicles and no...this isn't my pick to drive! I would rather drive our SUV that we have. It is a good truck though. We bought it new when they came out in 94 and other than recalls it hasn't had any problems. Ours is fully loaded with every option. It is just getting ready to hit 80,000 miles so it's time to trade. I don't know if it will be another Dodge or not. Chances are, it will be...those new 2001's are nice! Ours is navy blue with a blue interior and it has chrome wheels. The center flip console is very handy for laptops, cell phones, tapes, CD's, you name it. It goes fairly well in rough terrain and snow, but not quite as good as our other car. I don't like how the cupholders are above the radio in this truck. When you have a drink in the holder you can't see the time and you can't tune the radio or adjust the volume. That can get very annoying, but they fixed this problem for 2001, they are below everything close to the floor. I would recommend this truck to someone who likes trucks but has to travel a lot. The large size of the interior and the amenities you can get in it which compare to luxury cars make it nice for travel. In the 2001 model you can even get leather seats and woodgrain trim. I think that will be our next truck.
