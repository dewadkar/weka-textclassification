            When I first leased the Montero Sport 4WD in 1997, I was ecstatic but after about two years, I started to notice one big problem. I actually had no major engine problems but the steering was starting to feel funny. It felt loose and I was unable to make turns without feeling like I was going to drive right off the freeway or flip the truck! 

Just last week my lease was up and I decided to go for another Montero despite my fears. I use my truck to go snowboarding in the winter and hauling gardening stuff in the summer and I need a truck. Aside from my little steering problem, I know this car offers the best value for your money compared to other SUV's.  I did a lot of research before purchasing an SUV in 1997 and this truck was the best in value and quality.  To my knowledge there are only few others like the Nissan Exterra that  currently equal the value of the Montero Sport. 

As it turns out my 1997 truck was the first version of the Sport and as it turns out the steering was a problem. So I wasn't completely crazy.

My new Montero Sport LS 4WD is like an edited version of my old one. I felt a bit ripped off since there are less bells and whistles (i.e. no roof rack, no floor board, no overdrive)in the 2000 LS 4WD. However, you can get those options if you choose to go up a notch and buy the XLS or the Limited.  But personally I did not use any of those features and I felt fine with the LS. 

This truck handles very well. The steering feels solid and you can feel all of your turns without feeling like you're gonna flip over. Phew! The gas tank is relatively small for a mid size SUV as well. Above all, the Mitsubishi engine is very reliable.
