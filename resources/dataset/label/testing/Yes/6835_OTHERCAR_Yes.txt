            Purchased this vehicle used from original owner.
It had 90.000miles on it and had been serviced by Suburu dealer on a regular basis.

I bought it to commute 100 miles per day and during the first winter came to appreciate the secure feeling one gets with all wheel drive.
Deep wet snow and heavy slush were not a problem providing common sense is used.

The vehicle came with an additional set of Blizzaks which I have never installed as the Michelin A-Ones provide more than adequate traction and are much quieter. The all wheel drive system is superb.

Mechanically the vehicle has never needed any repair in the time I have owned it. Although it will be due for a timing belt replacement in a couple of thousand miles. This is one of the most important areas to take care of as a broken timing belt will leave you stranded.

This is a most practical vehicle for anyone considering a sport utility vehicle. There are several advantages to the Suburu over a full blown SUV.
Car like ride and handling - fits in a normal garage - low insurance premiums as apparently nobody wants to steal them - solid well put together car(USA)- reasonably good fuel economy - lots of cargo space.

 As a mechanic that has owned a lot of different vehicles I must say I am impressed with this car and would not hesitate to buy another one.<br><br>
