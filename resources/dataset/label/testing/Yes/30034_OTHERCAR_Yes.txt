            I purchased this camera used about a year ago primarily to take pictures of my baby (born in november).  I've taken over 6000 pictures (hey first time dad) so it's gotten used quite a bit.  I've also purchased a 32 Meg card so I take all high resolution pictures and I print them out on photo paper.  I also use a card reader and to anyone who takes lot of pictures to get one.

I love the resolution (2.3 megapixel though if I had more money I'd probably buy higher) and the 8x10's that print are pretty good.

Now I take almost all the pictures without a flash, don't want the baby to be blind and this is my first complaint is that without the flash, indoors pictures, the resolution can suffer quite a bit.  Movement is impossible to catch in low, mid lighting and I have quite a few pictures with blurry hands, arms, etc.  I've given up on nighttime (artificial lighting) pictures, but outdoors are great, and daytime indoors (near a window) are pretty good too.  The nice thing with digital is if you don't like, you don't keep it or print it.  

The shutter lag is talked about quite frequently so I won't go into it further.  There's the other lag of the camera transferring the picture to the card.  The camera can hold 3 high-res pictures and it takes about 1-2 minute to transfer it to the mem card, so I've often had to wait after taking a string of pictures and it can get annoying, though these problem exists with most of the digital cameras. 

The battery life is also talked about a lot, I use NiMH batteries and I got another 4 as a present so I use one set while charging the other set.  I can actually take about 150 -200 pictures without the flash so it's not too bad, one thing to note is that the camera has problems detecting the life of NiMH batteries and the low battery symbol comes up though I can still take another 100 shots with it.  I think kodak has a patch for this, but i haven't tried it yet.

The red eye problem exists but since I don't use the flash too often I don't see it, also most photo editing programs can easily fix them

In all I like this camera a lot and would recommend it though I've heard the new kodak camera might be better.
