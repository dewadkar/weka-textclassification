            I bought my 1994 Nissan Pick up Truck from a used car dealer in 1997. I got a really great deal on it. This truck has been the epitome of reliable. The only work I have done on it involved minor body repair(my own fault) and regular oil and spark plug changes. The truck has plenty of power. It is a manual shift 5 speed. The steering is great and the air conditioner does a super job. My seats are factory issue leather and grey in color. The console and dash are charcoal. The radio is also still factory issue and the tape deck plays like new. 
Shifting is easy but at times I feel like I need longer legs because the clutch has to be pushed down so very far. That is really the only half way bad thing about this beautiful little truck. It does not drive like a Mercedes but it does not ride like a tractor either.
Overall, I have been nothing but impressed with my Nissan Pick Up.<br><br>
