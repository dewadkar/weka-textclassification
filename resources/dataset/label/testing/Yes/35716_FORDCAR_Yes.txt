            I bought a 1990 Mustang GT convertible in 1998 to use as a car to run around the island of Hawaii when we are there.  The car had about 60k miles on it when I bought it.  It is a fun car to drive and the gas mileage is pretty good as well.

As of this writing the car has about 80k miles on it and the only repairs that have been made are the radiator replaced, both rear window motors replaced, both mufflers replaced (due to speed bumps) and soft top replaced.

The car has the automatic overdrive and due to this transmission is not very well suited for mountainous driving.  The reason is it can not be downshifted and held in second gear.  It is true that above 30 MPH the transmission will downshift into second gear by placing the shift lever into the "L" position, but as soon as your speed drops below about 30 MPH you get a violent downshift to first gear.  On Hawaii there are many downgrades that require either downshifting your car or riding the brakes.  

The Mustang has been a very good and reliable car for me and I would recommend the Mustang to others.
