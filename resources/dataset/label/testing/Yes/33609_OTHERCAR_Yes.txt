            I've owned a lot of cars over the past 35 years, but I've never had as much fun driving one as I have since purchasing my 1999 Porsche Boxster!
I drive my Boxster daily (except in snow and ice) and it is a consistent performer with outstanding reliability.  I love the tight sportscar feel and ride that the 18&quot; wheels and sports package give to the car.  If you're not into the hard ride of a true sportscar, you might want to opt for the standard 16&quot; or optional 17&quot; wheels.  

This car is as at home on the highway as it is on those winding 2-lane roads through the countryside.  It seems the more I drive this car, the more I like it.  (Oh, yeah, it turns a lotofheads, too.)   The mid-engine weight distribution makes this car hug the road and it really loves the corners.  With the top down, the aerodynamics send the air over your head and not into your face like so many other convertables.  The wind screens in the rollbars behind the headrests quiet the ride, too.  They're a worth while option.

I test drove four 1999 model sports cars when shopping: the Boxster, the Mercedes CLK, the BMW Z3 and the Corvette.  They are all similarly priced, but the Porsche had all the things I was looking for in a sportscar.  Yes, the Corvette had more horsepower and the Mercedes was &quot;cushier.&quot;  The BMW seemed underpowered and the one I drove felt &quot;tinny.&quot;  After test driving all four cars twice, there was no question that the Boxster was the car for me!  It was well worth the 4-5 month wait I had for delivery.  (I ordered the car in a color and equipped the way I wanted it.)

I've had the car for a full year(this month)and have not made an unscheduled visit to the shop. Would I recommend the Boxter to someone shopping for a true sportscar/convertable?  You bet, I would!!<br><br>
