            This is my first Digital Camera, and I absolutely love it! I would recommend purchasing it from an outlet store, such as Wal Mart, because they sell it for A LOT cheaper. Image quality is excellent, and quite sharp. Resolution is good, about 1 mega pixel, 1024x768 - enough to fill a standard screen - and is more than enough for a website owner. Flash could be a little less bright, but by lowering exposure timing, it is resolvable. Battery life is OK, But I would recommend a good set of rechargeables, I recommend the Rayovac ULTRA batteries. The Duracell Ultras that came with it lasted about 60 pictures. The LCD is a major reason I bought this camera, it is small, yet sharp, and provides a good view to take pictures with. Its only fault is that it is almost impossible to see the LCD if outside. My unit came with both USB and Serial cables and along the USB cable a 1 Mega Pixel image took less than 10 seconds to download. The on-camera controls were a little hard to learn, but they arent too complicated. The viewfinder is a little off, but is possible to work around. I would definately recommend getting a 16mb compactflash card, wich will upp the total memory to about 20 mb, allowing you to take 48pics at best resolution, and 347 at minimum! The case it came with holds the camera snugly, and securely. It also has a belt loop, so that frees up your hands to carrying other things.
