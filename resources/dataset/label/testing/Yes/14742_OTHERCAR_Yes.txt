            I bought my 1987 CRX with 56,000 miles on it in 1991.  It now has $180,000 miles on it, a loose bumper, a couple of dings and could use some new tires, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  This is, bar-none, the goingest little car I have ever owned.  It has amazing pick-up for a four-cylinder engine, corners and handles like a dream, gets about 40-45 mpg in town, and I can park that puppy almost anywhere.  

I am a legal secretary and work in the heavily congested downtown area of my city and live 60+ miles away in the country.  I wanted front-wheel drive because I drive some country roads that do not have the advantage of frequent snow plows and the occasional cow in the road.  But I also drive city streets where nearly anything can dart out in front of you.  Since it is a little car, I chose the easily visible red one.  Since it is so small -- a 2-seater -- it probably wouldn't work for a family car, but for my daughter and me, it is great.  Our German Shepherd/Doberman mix can easily squeeze himself into the back open area and we're off.

The only drawback I noticed was that even without weight in the back, the car would hydroplane badly, even in a light rain.  With a little weight in the back, it was almost uncontrollable.  However, when I bought it, it had the original tires on it and they were getting worn.  As luck would have it, Goodyear came out with the Aquatread tires that year, the ones with the groove down the middle of the tire.  I bought two for the front and some good steel-belted all-weather radials for the back and I was in business.  In all the years since, I have not had to purchase a single snow tire and sometimes my tracks were the only ones on the road.  

I am so happy with this car, I just had to tell somebody.  I plan to keep it until it just lays down and dies.  Then, I'll cry.<br><br>
