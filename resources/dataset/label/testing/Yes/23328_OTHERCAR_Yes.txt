            The CASIO WQV-1 Wrist Camera Watch is one remarkable piece
of technology.  Imagine being able to take a digital camera
with you wherever you go and when the moment arrives, presto!
you've captured one of life's great moments in an instant.  

I had read about the WQV-1 about six months ago, and remember
being very intrigued at the notion of a wearable
wrist camera, and I must say, from the moment I opened the
box to the point of strapping it on my wrist, the excitement
never subsided.  This little gizmo is the product of
modern (high) technology and indicates to me
where technology is heading.  Can you imagine what it will
be like in 5-10 years from now? Wow!

Hooking the bundled infrared transmitter to your computer
is simple and straight forward.  So too was the software 
installation.  In no time I was downloading images from the
camera's 100-photo memory right to my desktop. Incredible!

I am so impressed with the WQV-1, that I'm now seriously
considering purchasing CASIO's latest color wrist cam, the
WQV3-1BNDL. Like the WQV-1, it displays a monochrome
image on the display screen built-in to the watch.  However,
what you see on your computer after downloading from the
watch's memory, are images in full-color.

Oh and don't forget, the watch tell time too!! It also
boasts: 5 alarms, hourly chime, stopwatch, count-down
timer and the ability to add text descriptions to the
photos in memory.  You can also toggle the display 
between date & time-stamp and normal photo modes.
