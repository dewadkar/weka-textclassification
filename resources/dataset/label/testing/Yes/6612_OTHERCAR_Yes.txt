            I bought my 85 Nissan Sentra wagon with 135,000 miles on it (and a newly rebuilt engine).  I've had it for over 9 years now, and had scarcely had any problems at all!  I've used it like a work truck--to transport yard waste, haul loads of books/boxes (nearly 1000 lbs!), etc.  It has more than stood up to all of my abuse.

Sure, the struts/shocks need replacing, but I've never done the clutch, belts, or much of anything else.  (Brakes, cv boot, alternator, but that's about it!) 

The gas mileage is great!  In town and on the highway.  The storage of this wagon is simply outstanding for its size!  It hauls waaaaaay more than my 93 Subaru Impreza "wagon," even though it's a smaller car!

I paid $1700 for it in 1994, and it's been a total bargain!  It now has around 200K miles on it.  

Has trekked in snow, and on VERY rough dirt roads. But with its light weight and older date, I have a hunch it's not so safe in a big crash. 

I'm not sure how well these engines hold up, since mine was professionally rebuilt at around 135K.  But the rebuilt has never had a problem in 65K miles.  

I think that if you can get one of these at a low price (and/or with low mileage), you'll like it.  With prices falling on 1990s vehicles, though, you may want to keep your eyes open for a newer car.  

It's the ULTIMATE economy car: small enough to park in cities, tough enough for country roads and for hauling stuff around, gets great gas mileage, and needs few repairs at all.
