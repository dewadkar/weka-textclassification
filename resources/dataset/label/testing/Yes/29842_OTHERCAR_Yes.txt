            I was 18 years old, and my first car died on me all together.  My family had just moved out of town, and I lived 7 miles to work.  I needed a car.  After searching around franticly, I was quite happy to find a 1993 Plymouth Sundance at a Jim Click dealership.  They wanted $4400 for it, which I still believe is a good price.  It was a little 5 speed 2.2 liter, so I wasn't going anywhere in a hurry, but the drive was nice and smooth.  It handled wonderful, and shifted smoothly.  The AC was ice cold, and didn't really take a whole lot of power from the drive.  (Not that there is much power to take from in the first place) I loved it, so I bought it.
  I guess this is where I should insert my horror story about how the car managed to break down, cost my life savings and cheat on my girlfriend, right?  Well, not exactly.  I have only two gripes about this car, and one was my fault while the other I blame on the dealership.
  I drove the car for about 3 months and then started hearing an awful squealing noise when I used the AC. The AC belt breaks, and it turns out that the dealership replaced a water pump in the car with one that was too big.  This caused tremendous rubbing on the AC belt, and any belt I put on had a life expectancy of 2 weeks.  The dealership wouldn't fix it, but I won't go into the reason, as this is a review on the car, not them.
  And finally.  The car's death.  I drove it through a two foot puddle...  Really really fast...  I was later told that Chrysler puts the air intake on the bottom of the engine, causing them to frequently waterlog the engine in very wet weather.  A combination of my own ignorance, and repair places telling me my starter was bad, left enough time for the water the engine had taken on to cause awful rust damage.  
  The whole time I had the car, I loved it.  It drove great, but due to technical difficulties, I bid the car farewell and sold it without an engine to the high bidder.  
  I got 24 miles to the gallon with this car, so I suggest it anyone who is conservative.  Not for the average teen driver.  This is a great car, but as I soon found out, it can't handle the stresses of a young driver.<br><br>
