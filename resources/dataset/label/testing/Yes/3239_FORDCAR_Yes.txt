            We bought a 1995 Ford F-150 Extended Cab pickup in a nice turquoise color. It has a very roomy interior, and it has a short bed.  The truck drives very much like a car with one exception.  It has a terrible turning radius! Make sure you have plenty of room to turn around! Parking is also a challenge because of the turning radius. We usually end up parking in the back end of the lot away from other vehicles.

It has a 5.0 liter V-8 engine which for this truck is slightly underpowered.  When pulling a trailer with this truck, it really slows you down.  It does handle heavy loads in the box well, though. 

Mechanically speaking the only major problem we have had has been the design of the brakes.  We have had to have the brakes replaced five times already.  After the brakes wear down, it starts to shake the whole truck.
Beyond that it has been a very reliable truck.

As stated in the title, this truck is always in need of more fuel.  On the highway it averages 12 miles per gallon and in the city 10 miles per gallon.  Thanks to Ford ingenuity, they have put two fuel tanks on this vehicle.  You can switch the tanks on the inside of the truck easily by pushing a button.  This makes it more difficult to fill since you have to fill two tanks, and it leaves the potential for more to go wrong.  We would prefer one large gas tank instead.

The truck's 4-wheel drive feature has come in extremely handy especially in the snow, and there is a push button on the dash board to turn it on, which is very convenient.  

The truck seats three in the front comfortably, and in the back, the bench and legroom make it cramped for adults.  Three adults can also fit in the back.  Since this vehicle is two door, it is very difficult to put a car seat in the rear of the vehicle.  In the front it is easy but only if the vehicle doesn't have dual airbags.  We added running boards to the vehicle to make it easier to get in and out.

People who haul or frequently carry large items or people who are in need of a good 4-wheel drive vehicle would do well with this truck.<br><br>
