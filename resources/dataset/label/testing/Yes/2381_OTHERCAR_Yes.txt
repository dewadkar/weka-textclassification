            I enjoy taking pictures for distribution on my web site (see my profile), and, being a beginning photographer, I wanted the ability to take any picture I want without eating up continuous development costs.

I read some reviews on this camera and it seemed like a nice mix of features.  Point and shoot, easy previewing, and multiple exposure modes (the 'bulb' setting is great for night pictures) made it an easy choice.  I picked one up for about $400 after a $100 rebate Toshiba has for the camera.  

Daytime shots come out crisp and detailed, using the 1600x1200 resolution.  The included 8MB smartmedia does not last long at high quality settings (1 picture per MB at 1600x1200) but you can take many more pictures by reducing the size and quality of the pictures.  I recently purchased a 32MB smartmedia so I can take 32 shots before unloading the pictures into my computer via USB.  800x600 size pictures look fuzzy to me.  If you are reducing the size further for web pages, the lack of quality will be hard to see.  For full screen pictures, 1600x1200 is the only way to go!  If you like taking closeups of flowers or other subjects, a 'macro' setting adapts the camera to focusing on close objects.  I have taken some excellent flower pictures using this feature.

As dusk approaches, you have several options-flash, 'film speed/iso', and bulb settings.  The flash works well for targets within 3-6 feet.  You can make the camera more sensitive to light by setting the ISO similar to picking ISO 100,200, or 400 speed film.  This enables you take pictures without the flash in darker conditions.  However, the colors start to turn yellow (depending on your ambient lighting), and this is not always the best bet.  A 'bulb' shot leaves the shutter open for up to 8 seconds, capturing more light-however any movement of the camera will make the picture a big blur.  If you have a tripod, the bulb setting is acceptable for taking pictures at night.  As a rule, as light decreases, the sharpness of your pictures will diminish, if you do not have a tripod to keep things steady.

The controls are easy to use, and several methods of preview even allow you to zoom in on sections of your pictures on the LCD screen.  The rubber door on the side of the camera that protects the connections is not the best but does the job.   USB transfers to my computer are rapid and easy to do.

The real test of this camera was a trip to South Dakota that I took recently.  You can find samples of the PDR-M5's output on my web site.  We brought a laptop with, so at the end of the day I could empty out 32 pictures and take some more the next day.  I never would have taken so many pictures if it was not for this digital camera (160 pictures).  And that allows for a higher chance that this amateur photographer will have a great photo to show off!

The battery drains fairly quickly; if you charge it the day before you are going to take a lot of photos you should not have a problem.  The other tip is to turn the LCD screen off whenever possible.  All digital cameras suffer from high battery drain from the LCD screens.

I have had the camera for about 2 months now; for the price, I am very pleased.  There were few accessories available when I first purchased the camera.  However, now you can find links on Toshiba's website that tell you how to get attachments for more zoom and various filters.

This is the first digital camera I have owned, and am pleased with its performance.<br><br>
