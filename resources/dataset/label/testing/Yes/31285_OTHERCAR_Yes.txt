            I have a 83 tercel shes a great little car, she's gave me a few promblems but she is still going strong. I have had this car for around 3 months but its been in my family for 5 years if not longer, first my mom had it for about 2 years then my younger sis bought it from her and had it until I got it from them thats how I know shes a great car. It is fairly good on gas some of the parts are costly but we usually look for a bargin, you cant even hear it running its a real smooth ride and it will usually hold no more than 5 passengers due to it having bucket seats. It dont take no more than 10 to fill the gas tank up, quiet running engine need i say more.<br><br>
