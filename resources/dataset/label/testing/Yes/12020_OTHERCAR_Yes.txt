            As if Honda didn't already prove itself enough in the sports car arena by producing the astounding Acura NSX, it now brings the S2000 off the Tochigi production line and into the hands of sports car purists who demand a no-compromise vehicle that is right at home on the race track.

WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DRIVE

If you're used to driving big-capacity high-torque engines your whole life, the S2000's performance will be an immediate disappointment.  Disappointment?  Well you see, the S2000 requires an entirely different approach to driving... or at least one aspect of it... gear shifting.  You have to rewire your cog-swapping faculties to hold a gear not until 5000rpm, not even 6000rpm.  In fact, at this engine speed, the S2000 isn't even hitting full stride.  That's right.  Floor that throttle and tell yourself NOT TO SHIFT, NOT TO SHIFT, NOT TO SHIFT... UNTIL... wait for it... n-i-n-e  t-h-o-u-s-a-n-d  r-p-m!!  Do this and you'll be rewarded with a 0-100km/h time of under six seconds and a quarter mile in the 14s.

OPEN AIR DRIVING

In the tradition of purist sports cars, the S2000 comes with a full convertible body, with an electric roof that lowers in under ten seconds.  To combat the decrease in structural rigidity that is so common with open top cars, Honda has added significant extra bracing to the bodywork, producing an extremely stiff car that doesn't suffer from any significant cowl shake or scuttle, even when negotiating bumpy roads.

PRACTICALITY (OR LACK OF IT)

One driver, one passenger, and an overnight bag each is about all the S2000's &quot;haulability&quot; stretches too.  But in a strange way that only adds to the charm of this car, and reflects its minimilistic approach.  You and that special someone with just enough gear for the week-end at your summer home, and a very special toy called the S2000 to get you there and back.<br><br>
