            I have the Ford Focus ZX3 hatchback 2000.  We bought it new in 2000.  All in all it is a good car, but not what I thought when I bought it.

The positives about this car is that it handles well, smooth drive.  Our model has a built in security system where if the right key isn't used, it will automatically shut off after a few minutes.  Nice except, you have to have this one special kind of expensive key.  We have the bright yellow color.  Which I hated at first, it is really bright.  You can't miss it in the parking lot.  But it has come to grow on me, and now I like it.  Plus, it is safe, good for visibility.  We have the hatchback, and it is roomy.  We fit a dresser we bought for my daughter in the hatchback with the seat down.  So you can transport items in the back.  Another positives is that the driver seat goes up and down along with forward and back, since I am short, this is nice.

The negatives I found about this car is that it is not good in the snow.  I think because it is so lightweight.  With minimal snow on the ground, I was sliding all over the place.  Luckily, we had a mild winter here in Pittsburgh.  Another negative is that there is not much room for kids.  When we bought the car the salesman told us there was plenty of room for a carseat, and it was our fault to believe him, and not try out our carseat in the car before buying it.  It is very difficult to get my daughter in and out of the back, also because it is only a two door, and not a four door.  Sometimes it hurts my back trying to get her in and out.  Another negative is that the radio volume doesn't go very low.  For example on my old car I had before I could turn the car off and if my daughter was asleep in the back I could still listen to the radio on low.  With our Focus, the volume on the lowest 1, is still loud with the car off.  If the car is running, it is low, but with the car off it is loud, especially for a sleeping baby.  And I really wouldn't care about this feature if I weren't a parent, and if I didn't value the time my daughter is sleeping.

All in all a good car, if I would buy it again, but I would buy the four-door which has more room, or even a wagon.
