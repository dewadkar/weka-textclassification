            I bought this vehicle when my 1986 Honda Accord gave me one too many problems.  It died just off the highway, and after I had it towed to my mechanic, I found out that it would cost $700 to fix.  I would have tried to squeeze a few more years out of it, but my son was only a couple months old and I wanted to have something more reliable.  I had also recently had various other problems and had poured large amounts of money into it already.  I figured, why not pour that money into a newer car?  After all, there was no guarantee that I wouldn't have to repair the darn thing again next week.  
I like Hondas, but I had had some problems (I won't get going on that!)with the service department of the only Honda dealer in our area(as well as having heard various other bad reviews from friends and co-workers).  I didn't want to have to deal with that.
After looking at the Consumer Reports list of used cars with good track records(and those to avoid), we looked at used cars on the internet and found a couple likely prospects in the 1995-1996 range.  It was a Sunday and we thought we would just go have a look at the car lots, as most dealers are closed on Sunday.
The first place we stopped at was Metro Lexus Toyota.  To our surprise, they were actually open.  Unfortunately, the car we had been looking at had been sold already.  The salesman tried to interest us in something else, none of them really seemed like a great deal, but I liked the Corolla (it was slightly beyond our price range).  We took it for a test drive and I really liked the way it drove.  I could be that anything was good after my old Honda, I don't know.  The back seat was rather small, but the only person that is usually back there is my son, and he doesn't take up a lot of space yet.
We were offered an excellent deal on this car as it was a fleet car that had been traded up on, and they had a number of them to sell.
This car has been <b>very</b> reliable for us so far.  I have also had nothing but the most excellent service from the dealership.  Our only problem is that I test drove it, but my husband didn't.  I am short and he is tall. OOPS!  It is very hard for him to get enough leg room for him to drive comfortably.  Darn, I guess I'll just have to drive.<br><br>
