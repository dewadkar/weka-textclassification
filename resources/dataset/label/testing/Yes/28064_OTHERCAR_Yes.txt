            The year before we bought our Impala, we rented one for our family vacation and drove it across the country.  We were impressed, to say the least.  Since owning our Impala, our opinion of the vehicle has not changed.

The car handles well and has good response even in tight turns.  You have great pick up with the V-6 engine.  There is no lagging behind!  

The interior is roomy for large and small framed people.  My only problem lies with my kids inviting too many friends with them on outings and not having seating space!!!!  The seats are comfortable, even on long trips.  There are drink holders in the front and back seats and an outlet for your phone charger that is separate from the one in the ashtray.

One of the biggest hits with me (especially now with gas prices the way they are)  was the gas mileage.  It is fantastic!  On the highway we average between 31 and 34 MPG.  (we get 34 when we run the cruise control and 31 without)  You can hardly beat that!!

The trunk is roomy with plenty of room for the entire family's luggage and then some!!!  With the fold down split rear seat you can even haul long or bulky items with no problem.

The things I dislike about the car are few.  The vents for the air conditioner  can be adjusted, but only so far.  Sometimes I find that I can't get them off of me without shutting the vent entirely and that is not what I want.  To counter that opinion is the fact that you can adjust the temperature to your satisfaction and there are separate temperature controls for the driver and the passenger.
The other dislike I have is the headrests on the front seats.  They look contemporary with their squared off shape, but I don't know many people with square heads so they are not overly comfortable to rest your head on.  We usually bring pillows on trips to pad them to make it more comfortable.

Otherwise I find I really enjoy the vehicle.  The sound system is great and there are bells and whistles for everything under the sun!  The car tells you when your washer fluid is low, when to change your oil and when you have an under inflated tire.  What more could you ask for except for it to drive itself!!!
