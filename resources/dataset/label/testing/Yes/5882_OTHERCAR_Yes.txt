            I had the opportunity of renting this vehicle for 3 days. During this time period, I drove it several hundred miles. I drove it around the Baltimore, MD beltway, twisting side roads, and some of that in the rain.

The handling left a lot to be desired. The ride was very nice, but when turning, the suspension traveled a bit too much for me. Granted, I am not an SUV owner, but I have owned a mid-size and full-size station wagons and both of those handled better than this car.

The transmission performed fairly well. There was a large lag in shifting, but we are not talking about a street racer here either. The transmission has a manual option that lets you choose the gear and shift through them at the flick of the lever. I found this nice, especially in city traffic.

The engine did not have a lot of power, but enough for transportation. Driving at highway speeds was fine, no problems keeping it up to speed. 

Traction was phenomenal! No matter how hard I tried to make the tires slip, it wouldn't let it. The all-wheel drive (AWD), in my opinion, is a must in every car.

The interior was set-up well. All controls are within easy reach and all are easy to operate. The analog clock is difficult to read when trying to get the time at a glance. The seats are horrendous. I was uncomfortable after 5 minutes of driving. They felt like foam covered with canvas. No support and minimal adjustment.

On the exterior, the car does look like a station wagon on steroids. I rather liked the appeal though. The styling was nice, and the keyless entry was even better.
