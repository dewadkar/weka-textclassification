            One of the best purchases I ever made was our 1994 Honda Accord. We bought it new in the Spring of 1994, and even though it is going on 6 years old now and has just over 100,000 miles, it looks almost like new! Other than the normal maintenance items, such as brakes, oil changes, and tires, (and the one major expense of getting the timing belt changed), we have had zero problems with this car. Yep, not one single thing has ever gone wrong with this car. (knocking on wood, LOL)
I've been sold on Hondas for a long time. They just are very well-built cars that keep their value extremely well. I fully expect this car to go well over 200,000 miles before needing a major repair such as a transmission or an engine. By contrast, our 1995 Ford Contour, with less than 70,000 miles, is showing signs of transmission failure.
One of the best features of this car, is the solid feeling and the competent handling. This car has been driven cross country, from LA and San Francisco, to Albuquerque, Oklahoma City, Washington, DC and New York City. I've even felt confident driving it in snowy and icy conditions.
It still gets very respectable gas mileage, and I hope we have this car for a long time to come!
