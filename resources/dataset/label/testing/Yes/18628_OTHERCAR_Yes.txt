             I have had my 1999 2 Door Alero GL3 about three months now.  Let me tell you it is fun to drive and has all the power you will ever need and handles like a bigger car.  I like the wide tires and the look of the car.
Plenty or passing power and handles very good in the turns and curves.
Room for 4 not 5....The only things that I do not like are the cup holders and the engine make a little noise but you get use to it and with the very good radio and CD you hardley here the noise.  This car is good for a single person, married people with one kid.  Young or old will like this car.  I traded in a Honda Accord for it.  Do get the one with the V6 engine.  The Auto is very smooth.  Again it's a very good car and fun to drive.  All you have to do is change the oil and rotate the tires and it will last you a l  o  n  g  time.

Update 7 months old 7,500 miles and still going strong!!!  One of the best cars that I have ever owned.  Great in all types of weather and hugs the road well.  Getting 21-23 mpg. Power when you need to pass.   No problem with the Alero to date.
