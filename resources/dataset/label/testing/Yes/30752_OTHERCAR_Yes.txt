            I will start off by saying that I'm not a computer nerd, I don't have a great deal of technical knowledge, &amp; this review will simply be my own personal experience with this camera. If you're looking for more technical info you should probably move on. :o)

I'm a 33 year old Mother of a 2 year old daughter. All of our family lives far away, &amp; getting 3 sets of film developed really was eating into our budget. Both sets of Grandparents have Internet access (one through AOL &amp; the other through webtv), so this seemed like a great investment. My husband gave me this camera for Christmas, &amp; I've used it almost non-stop ever since. I LOVE it! It takes even better pictures than our 35mm. It's easy to use, &amp; the resolution &amp; color are beautiful. 

However, I have a love/hate relationship with the computer program used to download &amp; edit the pictures. I find it to be painfully slow to get into the program, &amp; download the images. My husband also has a digital camera (different brand), &amp; his program is much quicker! Once you're into the program, &amp; have downloaded your images, editing is extremely simple &amp; self explanatory. There are also nifty little ways of adding big ears to people's faces, putting someone behind bars, sitting them inside of a sport's car, or surfing a wave, etc. 

All in all I have to say that I'm very happy with my camera. It takes great pics, &amp; even though the computer package that came with it is slow, I'm happy with the variety of options available to me. It's a fun little gadget! :o) However, unlike others have said here, I have to say that I've gone through batteries like crazy!<br><br>
