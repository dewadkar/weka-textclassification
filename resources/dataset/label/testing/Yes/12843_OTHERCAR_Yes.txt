            This SUV gets better gas mileage than my car! 

I can still make short turns (U-turns in intersections) and park in a �compact� parking space.
   
	The rear seats not only fold up, but can be totally removed if you want (we do this every week or two to transport our dogs).
   
	Nicer appearance than the older RAV4 and the plastic spare wheel cover even looks nice.  
 
 	It is easy to change the oil yourself (you don�t even need ramps) and the oil filter is located in easy reach from underneath the car (very little oil is spilled when removing the oil filter).
 
	It is hard to transport large objects because you cannot just open a back window or crack a hatchback door. (because the rear door swings left to right (not up) and the plastic center console gets in the way.  The only way to transport something that is long (such as 7 or 8 feet) is to recline the passenger seat all the was and lay it on top of that.  Hopefully you will not have a passenger for that trip.
  
	I loved the roof rack last Christmas when I tied my tree to it (so I didn�t get tree parts inside my RAV4).
 
       I wanted the daytime running lights, but I was told that was a feature that could only be added in Japan.  I thought that this sucked, so I don't have that feature (although I was willing to pay for it) because I did not want to wait 8 weeks for it to be shipped from Japan to Florida.
     
    
I got some extras and paid $20,000 out the door (after tax and everything else).

Plenty of acceleration for 4 cylinder automatic.

I have owned my 2002 RAV4 since September 2001 and I have 17,000 miles as of July 30, 2002 and I have not had a single problem.
