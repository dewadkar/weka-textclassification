            I've owned a 2003 Accord EX V6 Sedan with Navigation for about two months now, and have been driving it daily. My previous car was a 2000 Accord V6 with many less amenities. No question in my mind that Honda really did a great job in upgrading this car significantly. My new Accord is not the one I used to drive (although my 2000 was a very good vehicle in it's own right).
My 2003 feels and drives like a much more expensive car (I paid less than $26K). My coworkers are very impressed with it, and I regularly hear "This is a Honda?" when they see the car for the first time. My neighbor has a new BMW and is upset she didn't look at the Accord before buying her Beemer. The interior is very comfortable, the leather is of much higher quality than I expected, and the sound system (6-disc CD Changer) is very good (not to be mistaken for a Mark Levinson or other extremely high end system).
I originally hadn't planned on getting the car equipped with the Navigation System, but after having it demonstrated and taking an very extended "test drive" around Phoenix (which I don't know well), I was certain I wanted that option. It is indeed a very handy, useful, well designed system. I love that it talks to you (either Male or Female voice), and gives sufficient warning of your next turn or freeway exit. What a great tool! I can honestly say it makes driving the car more fun.
The power of this car (240 hp) is more than sufficient. It is smooth and quick, and much quieter than my 2000 for both engine "roar" and road noise. The cabin is very quiet on this Accord.
The number of features on this car for the price is unmatched by any other manufacturer. Honda has indeed "hit a home run" with this Accord upgrade. 
If you're looking for a quality, well equipped sedan that won't cost you an arm and a leg, you've got to look at this car.

Update: August 27, 2003
I was asked to comment a bit further, so here is some additional information:

Automatic Transmission: Very smooth shifting. Far superior to my 4-speed 2000 Accord V6 automatic transmission. Very hard to detect shifting sequence (very subtle).

Controls inside the car: Very well laid out and easy to use. They all seem to be where they should be. Very ergonomically placed.

Gauges: Has a standard set of gauges (Tach, Speedometer, Fuel, Engine Temp). One new twist I like is even on the daytime, the gauge cluster is illuminated. Makes it a bit easier to see even during the daytime.

Handling of the car: Handles very competently, but is not a sports car. Can corner pretty well, but has more of a "sedan feel". If you're looking to sprint around corners at 50 mph, you may want to look elsewhere. Overall, I must say that the 2003 Accord handles "softer" than my 2000 model.

Brakes: Very strong braking. I have had to back off on the pressure I apply to the brakes. Overall, I would say the brake power is excellent.

Back Seat Room: Very adequate and comfortable for up to 3 adults. I have had 5 good-sized adults in the car, and they were comfortable.

Gas mileage: I have 2,500 miles on the car and have averaged 26.2 mpg. The car is rated by EPA to get 21 City/30 Highway.
