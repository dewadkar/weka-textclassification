            This is truly my first car that I have bought, and I am very happy with my descision. It has a snappy little 1.6 liter engine, yet gets really good gas mileage. I am just over 6ft tall and can fit in the back seeat if needed. that is a big plus. The trunk is also large for a car of this size, making loading and unloading very easy. my only real complaint is  the weak cup holders. They look and feel cheap. but everything else about the car is awsome. Driving this car is very easy and the handling is very controled. Very little body roll, no squeaks. Tires howl a little but thats no big deal. This car is no rocket ship in terms of speed, but it can really hold its own from stoplight to stoplight. The low end power is almost non-existent, but once the tachometer hits 3500-4000 rpm, the car realy starts to fly. this is a comfy car, and I really think almost any one can be happy with this car<br><br>
