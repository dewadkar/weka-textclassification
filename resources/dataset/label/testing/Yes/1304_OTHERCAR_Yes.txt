                  Let me just tell you about my 1997 Toyota 4-Runner.  For a 19yr. old it is about the biggest dream that has ever come true.  I have a limited 4wd model.  It came with 55,00 miles on it and I've already, in four months put 25,00 miles on it.  The great thing about it though, it still cranks just as good and runs just as good as my buddies 2002 4-Runner.  The leather interior is definitely a plus especially if you're an avid outdoorsman like I am.  I bought the 4wd because of this too and I must tell you though it dampens my gas mileage by about 40 or 50 miles it is well worth it.  I get around 320mi/tank on the interstate and around 275mi/tank in the town I live in.  
      Being that it is 4wd most would worry about this being just "something else to go wrong" well, it's not.  I use the 4wd at least once a week for extended periods of time and I have no trouble with it.  The manufacturers have good warranties also. If the SUV is used they send them through a test and if it passes you get a certified vehicle with practically a brand new warranty.
      The great thing about 4-Runners is that they are rugged yet very luxurious.  Many high class people have them for their luxury car, others have them because of the need of space for the kids, and people like I have them because it is truly the best all around vehicle that I have come across.  I really hope that I have talked at least one of you into buying a 4-Runner, if there are any questions I have left open please feel free to e-mail me and ask.
