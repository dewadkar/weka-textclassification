            The Escalade is Cadillac�s first foray into the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) market, to compete with the likes of the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercedes M-Class trucks, and it is touted as �The Cadillac of SUV�s�. As the slogan implies, this vehicle is a luxury vehicle in a class of sporty cars. The Escalade is presented with no options other than color. Every luxurious feature is standard, from the leather and wood interior to the adjustable seats to the running boards, stereos and air conditioning units. The Escalade is fully loaded.

Driving an Escalade is like sitting in your favorite armchair. The heated, ten-way adjustable leather seats make sure that every-size driver is comfortable. The wood-accented dashboard makes all the gages easy to see and reach. The Bose Acoustimass music system is reminiscent of an awesome surround sound system. The lift and suspension on the Escalade is typically Cadillac, resulting in one of the smoothest-riding SUV around.  With plenty of power under the hood, the V-8 engine can really get up and go, while maintaining the quiet performance of a Cadillac.  The brochure accurately describes it as �the steel fist in the velvet glove.� 

In keeping with other family-oriented SUV�s, the back seat and storage area are spacious and the back seats fold down easily for more storage space. With the seats up, there is a roomy 66.9 cubic feet and with the seats down, the space extends to 118.2 cubic feet.  There is also a fold-down armrest with cup holders, a power outlet for cell phone or computer, and separate radio with headphones, and air conditioning controls.


The Escalade also comes with four choices of driving capability including Auto 4WD, 4WD Lo, 4WD Hi, or 2WD Hi. There are power windows and doors, daytime running lamps, remote entry, tinted glass, heated outside mirrors, a luggage rack, 6000 pound towing capacity, high ground clearance, five power outlets, a six-disc CD player, rearview mirror with auto-dimming capabilities and compass and thermometer. Also included in this outstanding package is an amazing device called OnStar that is almost Twilight Zone-ish in its performance.

The OnStar service is a cellular service that connects to a 24-hour service center via satellite. With the push of a button, you are immediately connected to the OnStar center, and here the possibilities are endless. �I see you are in a dark red �99 Escalade at the corner of Fowler and I-275�, said the voice through the speakers. �Would you like a demonstration?� At my response, the operator took me through an amazing list of options. Did I want to know what restaurants were within a two-mile drive? Did I want her to call ahead and make reservations at any restaurant or hotel? This was only the beginning of the problem-solving capabilities of the OnStar service. Lock your keys in the car? No problem�the Onstar could unlock your car remotely. Forget where you parked? Call OnStar�s 800 number and they could flash the lights and honk the horn until you start the car. Need direction or to know where the closest ATM is? Call OnStar. Have a flat tire, or the car running a little rough? Call OnStar for an immediate diagnostic report. In case of a stolen vehicle or the deployment of the airbags, OnStar is notified, and can trace the car, or call and ambulance and talk to the passengers until help arrives. This service alone makes the Escalade a truly convenient and practical SUV to own.

Priced at $46,525, the Escalade is the kind of SUV you�ll wonder how you ever lived without.
