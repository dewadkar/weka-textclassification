            I started looking at these cars after a trip to ireland which included a lot of rover rides....hauling horse trailers, cross country, off road, over shallow water, and the like.  When it came time to start looking at newer cars ( I drive close to 200 miles a day for work and live out in the boonies) I looked at discoverys first.  Then i found the range rovers. I drove a 1992 with 140,000 miles that was tight and responsive.  that made me look for newer ones I could afford with fewer miles.  After driving two 1994 models and looking at the new ones, I found a 1996 4.0 for 20,000 with 73k miles.  I have already put four thousand miles on it and LOVE it.  It gets between 16.2 and 16.8 mpg (according to its' own computations) and corners at much higher speeds than i am used to driving my windy up and down roads at.  It is comfortable but not &quot;squishy&quot; (I cannot thing of a better word) like cadillacs and lincolns. It handles beautifully.  It is not the first off the line but is plenty powerful enough to hold its speed in cruise climbing steep highway at 70mph and I am only passed when I choose to go more slowly.  For the large amount of time I spend in my car, I can honestly say that this beats everything I have had.  Yeah, and I just love the way it lowers itself when I turn it off so I don't have to climb down to the ground. My rural mechanic was disgusted and explained that there is only one other in this county and he sometimes has to wait two days to get a part....I didn't remind him that it took that long to get one for my old buick last time he worked on it.  VIsibility is grand....I'm short so I really revel in this view. And while I know that a sound system shouldn't influence the purchase of a car.......WOW. 
Just so you know I haven't been hypnotized by it, I will admit....the cupholders are abysmal.  That's about it....my only complaint.
