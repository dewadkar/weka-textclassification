            My wife is picky. She doesn't know anything about cars, but she knows what looks right. That's why, when I took her to the annual auto show, I was so happy that she liked the looks of this Pontiac. Usually, she likes Jaguars, Cadillacs, BMWs...you get the idea - the woman has expensive taste. We were looking for a good, reliable car to get her back and forth to work. We bought the Grand Am SE coupe. It's sporty enough, and quick enough with the Quad 4 engine. It's got great instrumentation - the red highlights at night look very cool. The cassette stereo sounds good, and the heater and air conditioner release just the right amount of heat and cold. 
As for reliability, it's rock-solid. We have had the car for 4 years and are just now going to have the brakes done. That's it - no problems for 4 years! 
The only thing that's bad about this car is the back seat. The outboard passengers are happy - it's the poor sap in the middle that has to sit on a very hard portion of the seat. One hour and you've had it!<br><br>
