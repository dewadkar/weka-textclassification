            	I purchased the basic RSX model for around $20,000 which got me a 6 gear manual transmission and 200 horses.  If you plan on going on a road trip buy a van.  This car&#146s only purpose is providing its owner with an adrenalin rush.  

	The RSX&#146s best feature is its acceleration.  I have never calculated the car&#146s 0-60mph time, but I&#146m sure the Consumer Report figures are accurate enough.  The ride is smooth and sporty, though a little bit noisier inside the cabin than my previous Acura Integra.  I took the RSX for a test drive and slammed on the gas switching gears as fast as I could.  The acceleration was incredible, in a matter of seconds I was going 50mph on a 30mph road.  

	The RSX&#146s comfort is unimportant.  I had heard the RSX&#146s acceleration and handling was superb which were the only factors I truly cared about when I decided to replace my Integra.  The comfort is acceptable, nothing special, though the leg room is not that generous for someone who taller than 6 feet.  The features are standard for this type of car.  The stereo system is nice, but again, nothing special.  Room is limited in general though the trunk is larger than it looks (I can fit about 2 large suitcases in it).

	 The RSX&#146s pros: Acceleration, sleek design, 6 gear shifter (that extra shift makes it so much more fun) powerful engine.

	The RSX&#146s cons: Unlike other Acura models this is not a luxury car.  No gps, phone, butt massager, etc.  The cabin looks nice but it&#146s a little noisy at high speeds.  Leg room and passenger space.  Trunk is bigger than it looks but still not very useful.

	Overall: Buy the RSX if you like a sportive and performing car for not a lot of money.  The RSX is cheap ($19,000-$22,000) in comparison to a Porsche or BMW and has better acceleration than the BMW 3 series (possibly the 5 series as well) which starts at around $26,000; though the RSX sacrifices room and comfort for pure performance.
