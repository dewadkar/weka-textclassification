            My wife and I were looking for a good used mini-van or truck of some sort (no kids, just needed room to haul &quot;stuff&quot;).  I noticed how low the resale value on the 96-99 Taurus was and found a used wagon for cheap $$, about 4K less than a minivan or truck of the same year.  As a tightwad of sorts, that sold me on the Taurus wagon.  Consumer Reports seemed to think that it was reliable and that sealed the deal.  We bought a GL (low end), base engine, basic equipment (Windows, locks, and AC are standard)but with the third seat.

The car could use a few more beans under the hood but once it gets going, it runs fine.  The transmissions shifts smoothly and the car has plenty of room.

My dislikes are about the interior.  It seems that no one actually &quot;sat&quot; in this car before releasing it to the public.  The dashboard has a huge storage unit that pulls out (the ashtray comes out of this unit to reveal the storage area I speak of.)  It is useless because if you fold the console up out of the seat it blocks access to the storage unit coming out of the dash.  The fold up console is supposed to hold two cups but it does not because when you accelerate the cups will fall out of the holders (this was fixed on the 2000 model).  Every GL Taurus I have seen (including mine) has the factory console folded into the seat and a $5 Wal-Mart Console on the floor.  The top of the dashboard is curved so I can't put my glasses up there either.  My other car has bins, cup holders, etc, and is more convenient.

Enough of the harping.  The car has good points.  It has been bulletproof to date, rides great, and will haul a load when asked.  The layout of the dashboard is unique, but easy to use.  It has more room than most SUV's and gets well over 25MPG on the highway.  In the city it never gets below 22MPG.

If you are going to get a Taurus, get the wagon!!!  It comes standard with a better rear suspension, rear anti-roll bar, and four wheel disc brakes.  Furthermore, it has more headroom in the back seat and you can even get a third seat for two little ones.  It looks better than the ugly sedan also.<br><br>
