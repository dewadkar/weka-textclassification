            My last two cars were a 1980-something Audi 4000 (terrible electrical troubles) and an 87 S-10 with  more miles than my grandmother. It was time for something new. I wanted a car that was reliable, economical, and not stuffed with lots of little electrical things like power windows that could quit on me. After diligent research the 5-speed manual transmission 1.6L Geo Prizm was my choice. Best choice I ever made.  I owned the car for 7 years, 11 months. When I sold it at 113,000 miles the car still had its original shiny paint, original clutch and brakes. In fact, I never had to replace anything on this car except battery (4 years) and tires. I did hit a deer which crumpled the thin aluminum hood and crushed the left fender, smashed the left headlight and broke the grill and engine fan --$2,500 repair bill.  The interior looks like it did when I first bought it.  To my astonishment, despite having daylight running lamps, the headlights (except when I hit the deer), nor any lights for that matter, ever burned out.  The few maintenance issues I have had: 1) The key or lock for the driver's side had become worn and I would have trouble opening the door sometimes. 2) The starter needed cleaning/repairing due to a worn contact point.  Gas mileage is about the best of any car around: 36-38 mpg on the highway, low 30's in the city. I sold the car because after almost 8 years and 113,000 miles I preferred to "quit while ahead" and get another new car: a Toyota Camry, a cousin of the Prizm.
