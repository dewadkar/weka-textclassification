            We recently purchased a used Chevrolet Cavalier RS. 1992 with 70,000 miles. After shopping all summer, bouncing back and forth from new lot to used lot, and back again, we finally found the one we both fell in love with.  The car has very obviously been rebuilt from some sort of wreck, but having first hand knowledge of mechanics and body repair, I was able to comb the car over for defects. The work had been done well and the price was right! When we compared this car to the new ones in it's class, we found astronomical prices, no interior room and unappealing new body styles.  The early 90's cavaliers seem to have held their value in this area and seemed much more appealing than the newly redesigned models.  Having found this particular one that had been reconditioned, we were able to buy a used car with fairly decent mileage in addition to a brand new paint job, hood, side corner panels and bumpers.  The previous owner had obviously taken extremely good care of the interior and we are thoroughly enjoying it! 

It is important to take note that this kind of purchase should be made with an expert opinion on your side. We saw many reconditioned vehicles that has not been put together all that well. Many used dealers are buying  wrecked cars and putting a few hundred dollars into them and trying to pass them off as good used cars. Be careful!! We do not recommend buying used unless there is someone of knowledge to back you up. If you are fortunate enough to have the knowledge or know someone who does, we highly recommend buying used. We found a super car with lots of value for an affordable price. Much more interior room and a body style much more appealing that the new &quot;mainstream&quot; sedan style.  <br><br>
