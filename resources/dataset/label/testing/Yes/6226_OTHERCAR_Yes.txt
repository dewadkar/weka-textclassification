            I purchased my 2000 Frontier crewcab in May 1999. It is 1 1/2 yrs old now with almost 16000 miles. Before I owned a Nissan 1993 Pathfinder which I loved. I had to find something bigger than the Pathfinder when I started my own cleaning service. The cargo area in the Pathfinder wasn't big enough. The Frontier Crewcab fit the bill. Although the bed is only 4'8&quot; it can hold a lot of things. I have a hard locking cover on my truck which makes it easier to store things. There are numerous areas for you to tie down things in the bed. Mine has a bed liner which has saved my bed multi times. I have hauled retaining wall blocks, groceries,plants and trees,sheets of drywall(with the tail gate down), 4X4's and numerous other things in the bed.So far the only thing that I'm not able to carry in the bed is an extension ladder longer than 20'. Tows well too.
The engine is the same as the Pathfinders but it has more horsepower. I get better mileage than the Pathfinder which is very important now with gas prices going through the roof.Although the Frontier crewcab is longer by 2' than the Pathfinder it handles the same. Turning radius is the same. Its a snap to parralle park because it handles so well. It has the smoothest ride I've ever had and one of the quietest.Stereo/CD is great. Everything is electrical including the sunroof. I saved the best for last. These trucks are reliable. Hasn't had to go to dealer for repair yet. Oil changes only so far.   <br><br>
