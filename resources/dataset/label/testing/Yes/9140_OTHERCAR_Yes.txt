            I purchased the navigator in 1997.  It has held up wonderfully over the years.  This spacious confortable vehicle is ideal for my family of six.  With its air-ride suspension system, you feel very few bumps.  This is ideal for the heavy commuter and those who practically live in their car (as I seem to do).  I have been a fan of the suv vehicles since their entrance onto the road.  I test drove a myriad of other such cars, but none held up to the status of this great car.  I drove the infinity qx4, mercedes suv, as well as the lexus lx470.  None were as comfortable, smoothe, or well adept to city traffic as the navigator.  It was a great buy for me and the kids, and I recommend it to any who are considering purchasing a new suv vehicle.  It was the perfect remedy to a busy life.  <br><br>
