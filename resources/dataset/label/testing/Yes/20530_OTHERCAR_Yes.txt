            I have to say.  I love the Cirrus!  I bought a 1995 first and yes there were recalls but that is to be expected when a car is first put on the market.  I thought Chrysler was very careful to make sure consumers were aware of the recalls.  The cars a sporty, roomy, ride well, get good gas mileage for a V-6 engine, and I think they are priced well for the quality of car.

I am on my second Cirrus now it is a 1999 Lxi and for a car that has leather interior, moon roof, 6 disk CD player, and a power package I paid $18,500.00.  When my husband and I went to purchase a new car this time, we looked at just about everything that was out there in the under $20,000 range and nothing could compare to the luxury and sportiness of the Cirrus.  I consider my husband to be an expert because he used to do reconditioning on pretty much every kind of car there is.  He knows the true values of cars (meaning how much they depreciate when you drive them off the lot, blue book values, etc.).  The Cirrus holds it's value and has been rated well in safety tests done by The National Insurance Commission.  You can fit 5 people in the car comfortably, so if you have up to two kids you are set!    <br><br>
