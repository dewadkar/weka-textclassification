Honk Honk!... I heard the sound out in the garage as my girlfriends parents pulled up in to the garage. I saw the the brand new lexus, the silver paint job blinding me with its glow. &quot; You get to drive this to prom!&quot; I t seemed like Christmas morning when those words flowed from my girlfriend's dad's mouth. A week later there I was all dressed up with my date, and my girlfriend too. I sat there driving the car, my mouth wide open in awe. I couldn't get over what a versatile car I was driving. Not only did it handle and accelerate like a champ, it had all the signs of a family oriented car also. It has a nice leather interior,and a six disc cd player in the glove compartment! All of the interior frills kept my girlfriend busy while I took corners a little faster than I should've and punched the gas off the line. What a wonderful car! To drive this car is a treat and an honor every time.<br><br>
