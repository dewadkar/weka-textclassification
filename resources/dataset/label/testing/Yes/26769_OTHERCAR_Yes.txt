            We bought our '94 Jeep Cherokee when my wife got tired of trying to maneuver our '88 Lincoln Town Car in tight places. She loves the Jeep because it's easy to turn and park, and is very fast, with its 4-liter 6-cylinder engine and responsive automatic transmission. I like it for those reasons, too. And it's versatile. I know it'll go into a lot of off-road places (not that I've had it off road much, and ain't that typical?), would tow any trailer that we'd ever pull and it'll haul a lot of stuff with the rear seat folded. It carries four adults in reasonable comfort for short distances. 

This car/truck has the Country package with chrome bumpers and attractive plastic panel trim, big aluminum wheels, a fake wood-trimmed interior and decent cloth seats, plus power windows and door locks. But it is no luxury car, and I wish it rode smoother and had less wind and tire noise at highway speeds. 

It had 75K miles on it when we bought it and now has 90K, with no major repair problems. However, we found some oil leaks before finalizing the deal and had the dealer fix the rear-main oil seal on the engine and a seal on the front differential. (I previously owned a '92 Comanche pickup whose rear-main seal was also going out when I sold it at 65,000. It probably would've cost $200 or $300 to fix, so if you are looking at a used one, check that seal carefully.) Also, the Cherokee's brakes were sticky and the front brake pads squeaked loudly when warm; mechanics at a repair shop found that the pads and rotors were glazed, and roughing up the pads and turning the rotors solved that minor but annoying problem.

My sister in the Midwest just bought another Cherokee after putting nearly 100K miles on her '94, so she's typical of the loyalty the people seem to have for these things (then again, her husband sells Jeeps!). My wife and I would like something more comfortable, but it would be nice to keep our Cherokee besides. It's really a neat little rig.
