            We needed a minivan for our family. Tried out the 2001 model with no extras-base model. It has plenty of power and I know what I'm talking about. I have some high-powered vehicles and hate limp-wristed rides. Easy to get in and out of. Durable materials, easy to clean the inside. Be sure to get one of those plastic liners for the rear compartment. It makes it easier to drop a pair of dirty boots in and not ruin the carpet. The Dealer price was the best for this accesory. If you have the bucks and a weak back, go for the better seats. I'm in good shape but my back gets to me after several hours of driving. A salesmen friend has the same van and back! We both get fatigued after a long drive.  The option for the second sliding door was too expensive and not necessary for me.

The rear end does bounce up and down a bit after a road dip. Tighter springs would help but make normal driving rough. You just get used to it.  The driver side flip up arm rest keeps falling off. The retainer clip is broken. I just have to take it in for repair. The rear door is a bit hard to lift up. The gasket appears to stick to the body.

We really love the van. We have two active boys. There is NO way I'd buy a fancy leather-clad suv with all the activity we see. MY friend got a new Durango when his company windstar went off-lease. He hates it because there is no room in it. Wishes he had the van back. 

I installed a receiver hitch to pull a pig roaster and bike rack. Unless you are handy have someone else do it. The dealer gave me some line about an expensive brake light cable ($100.00) when I went in to inquire about the hitch after I got the van. I got the cable for about $20.00 elsewhere. Check on-line too.

Good van.
