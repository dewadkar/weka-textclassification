               I just cannot say enough about the Ford Expedition. I have owned one for the past two years and have been extremely happy with this vehicle. I have taken the family to Myrtle beach on two separate occasion in this vehicle and the drive was pleasurable. My wife particularly loves the vehicle because she feels secure behind the wheel. It is a very safe vehicle and extremely reliable in any type of weather. During the Labor Day storm we had in the northeast, my wife was out shopping and got caught in the store during the storm. The power went out in the store and the customers were told that the store was closing. Outside there was a number of trees and power lines down. My wife was very confident that this vehicle would get her home safely and that is what it did. There isn't a driving situation that this vehicle will not overcome. This vehicle is for everybody especially for a large family,lots of room. Love it.  <br><br>
