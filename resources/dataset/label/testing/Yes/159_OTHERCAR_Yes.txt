            This is a very good deal.  Fuji is closing out this model and it is available for under $300 all over.  I bought mine for around $ 245 at auction at Egghead.com. 

This is a terrific camera!  Has all the features I wanted in a inexpensive digital camera: 1.6 LCD preview screen, over a megapixel picture, lightweight, easy to use and inexpensive.  


The camera can take different size memory cards so it can hold a good deal.  It comes with a 4MB Card.  


The LCD screen is clear (if a bit small) and the picture quality is outstanding.  I was very please with the photos it took.

My biggest complaint is battery life.  Only so-so.  It needs constant replenishment of new batteries.  Not using the LCD expands the life of the batteries but that defeat the purpose somewhat.

Overall a great deal.  Best price and quality for its category.
