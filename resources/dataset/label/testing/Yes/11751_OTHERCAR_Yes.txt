            I recently purchased the Kodak DC3200 mainly because of the price (I got it at buy.com for $187.00) and also because of the trusted name of Kodak. I must say that i was pleasantly surprised. When using the camera in daylight with the flash set on auto you can take a pretty good picture on the best setting. I also bought a 20meg compact flash card to go along with the camera because it only has 2meg of internal memory which is good if you only plan to take pictures at home where you can download them constantly. 

I also found that this camera was not too bad on battery use. I would purchase the optional adapter although to use while downloading your pictures because this does take a while. I should also note that this camera uses a serial interface so it's not as easy to connect to your camera as a usb interface would be. 

When printing the pictures on photo quality paper i got excellent results. Pictures taken at the 'Best' quality were almost as good as the real thing. There were some distortions when taken at 'Good' or 'Better' but if you plan to use the pictures for a web page or email these quality settings will do just fine.

This is also a very sturdy camera. I once left it within the reach of my 9 month old daughter who proceeded to beat it with a metal spoon she had been making &quot;music&quot; with. It came out without a scratch.

Some things I do not like about this camera are that the software that comes with the camera is barely adequate. You may want to look into buying some photo editing software or downloading something for free from downloads.com. I also do not like how once you push the button to take a picture the camera does not actually capture the photo until a few seconds later, which means you have to anticipate movements from baby, etc. The last drawback is the small amount of memory that comes with the camera, although you can buy the 20mg card on kodak.com for $39.95 until the end of the year (I think).

Overall, this is a great camera to start with or if you don't want to spend a lot of money taking pictures of your family and friends. I suggest you give it at try, after all, you can always take it back!<br><br>
