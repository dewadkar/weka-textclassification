            Let me first say that i bought this car as a replacement to my last car. Another Honda. In fact this 97, is the 5th Honda that i have owned. My experience with the Honda has been flawless. I have never had to take any of them to a repair shop for anything. And I DO DRIVE fast. Typically I rev the engine to the limit in all 3 gears. Never have I done any modification to any of them. This current Civic is as good as the rest of them. The roominess that I have is great for the things I do. I windsurf, bicycle and camp. Although I am single and rarly have more than 1 other person with me, it is room enough for all the equpitment and some. The only thing that I have had to do on any of the Honda's that I have owned is to replace tires. Wow, I wonder why? 
Reliabilty is a non issue with any Honda. I have been told that the Japanese Canadian and American models in that order are the best. I am only aware that the Prelude is Japanese made. Gas milage is great; the Civic has always been a frugal car. I have ridden in and drove friends Civic's modified, and they are amazing. By simply lowering them and putting larger tires on, makes the Civic feel as if it on a rail track. The road handling capabilities are astounding. I had a 1979 Corvette that didnt feels as stiff as some of the Honda's that I been in. A popular magizine &quot;Sports Car Compact&quot;, is a good source to find those aftermarket parts. A plethera of parts can be purchased and easly installed to create a very fast, totally reliable, and gas frugal ride.
I typically buy a new auto every 2-3 years, and you can bet it will be another Honda. I would like very much to drive the SI model Civic, with 160 HP. Well I'll let you know when I do.
I would recommend this vechicle to anyone. I have logged several long distance trips with this car. Fl to CT.	<br><br>
