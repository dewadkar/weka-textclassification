            I have had experience with both the fd-83 and the fd-73.  The fd-73 is the earlier of the two versions.  The one thing that is great about the fd-73 is the zoom feature.  It has 10 X optical ( not digital )zoom, which can come in very helpful.  The fd-83 only has 6 X digital.  The 73 is going to cost less than the 83.  However, the 73 does not have the video capability that the 83 and other older models have.  I know it is supposed to be a still camera, but the video is fun.  I would find someone who has one of these cameras and then see which ones you like the best.  They are a great toy.<br><br>
