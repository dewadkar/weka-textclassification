               Chevy is a name I trust, and the s-10 is no different.  I bought a new 1998 s-10 LS in november of 1998.  I have had it over a year now, and have driven it 22,000 miles.  I have not had any problems with the truck, and I get a lot of looks because the black looks great in the sunlight.  Being from Buffalo, NY I drive in  a lot of snow, and other crappy weather.  Although only 2wd, with a couple sand bags in the back, the truck drives smoothly, and does not get stuck.  Cd player, and cassette, along with cruise control makes it a great vehicle for long distance drives.  Overall this is a great truck, and when I go to buy a new truck, I will buy another chevy s-10.<br><br>
