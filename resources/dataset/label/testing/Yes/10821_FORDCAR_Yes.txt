            When I went looking for a mini-van, I narrowed my choices down to two - The Ford Windstar and The Toyota Sienna.  I test drove both but I drove the GL model in the Windstar and the top of the line Sienna.  As far as the overall drive I would have to say the Sienna was slightly more nimble and smooth, but not by much.  The one thing I was shocked at though was I was driving a top of the line Sienna and the interior looked so plain and simple - almost cheap.  The Windstar was much more comfortable and although it was a GL, the packages created a much more comfortable ride overall.  Finally what got me was the price and availability.  Toyota didn't have any in stock and estimated about an 8 week delivery.  My experience with Japanese deliveries (Used to lease cars for my job) was that usually 8 weeks turns into 16 weeks and according to what time of year you are in, it could take even longer and end up into the new model year.  Most manufacturers stop making the current year models in May or June to get ready for the next year's model.  Because of this delay, Toyota was not willing to move on price at all.  I did not get to see a scaled down version of the Sienna, but I felt I had more in the Windstar GL than the top of the line Toyota.  Yet the scaled down version of the Toyota would have cost me almost $3,000 more than I paid for the Windstar.  I have not been disappointed in my purchase.  Also, safety was rated slightly better on the Ford than the Toyota.<br><br>
