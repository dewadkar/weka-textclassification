            I won't bother repeating the Matrix's specs. Instead, here's my impression of the car:

I test drove a Matrix XR 5-speed today, after having recently tried the new Rav 4. I was looking for a 5-seater, fun, reliable, good sized car to replace my old Integra. I'd decided the Rav 4's storage space was pretty darn small, and I have a lot of stuff I need to keep stored in my car. The Rav 4 also did not have the light airiness that I've enjoyed in my Integra.

The Matrix XR I test drove had the sports package with sunroof, which was a nice size although pretty noisy on the freeway.

I found the car very roomy, with comfortable seats (as did my salesman who is 6.3 who I had sit in the back seat). I'm short so the driver's seat was pretty far up and he had several inches from knee to seat, which was good to know in case I ever start shuttling football players around. 

The red lit controls are very hard to read with dark sunglasses on. The manual gearshift is very close to the control panel so if you're in a gear that's pushed toward the panel, some controls could be hard to access.

It's radius ROCKS. Turns on a dime. You can easily rip a 360 in an intersection (vs the PT cruiser which was like turning a boat). 

I had a weird experience in 2nd gear where I was cruising along at around 25 or 30 and it slowed down then hopped forward. This happened a couple of times, and no my foot wasn't on the clutch. The salesman's theory was that I had maxed out 2nd gear and that it automatically "reset" me down to the speed I should have been driving at. That sounded like a "snowjob the female" kind of answer as I was not going that fast at all. Bottomline: Fully explore 2nd gear when driving.

I also found 4th gear a lot more sluggish than 5th gear, strangely, when climbing a hill.

I realized the Matrix design is much like the Citroen's of the 1970s, which makes the look even more appealing.

These are my only concerns, aside from a worry that I might get tired of the design. But I hope another test drive will help me overcome these as it's hard to find a car that's spacious, reliable, sporty, and doesn't break the bank.

I used to be obsessed with the PT Cruiser's spaciousness but was gunshy on buying it for various reasons. So the Matrix could be a nice alterative.
