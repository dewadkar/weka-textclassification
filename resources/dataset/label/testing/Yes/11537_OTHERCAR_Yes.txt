            I purchased my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Limited after I just about rode my 1991 Cherokee Laredo into the ground.  To be perfectly honest I didn't even think seriously about purchasing anything other than a Cherokee, so if you want comparative perfomance vs others SUVs this is not the review for you.  However, since I have driven enough miles to take me around the world and back several times I have some pretty strong opinions on this vehicle.

First, the build quality is excellent.  Some might have beefs with the build materials but the quality of work done is very solid.  Since the engineering has not changed substantially in nearly a decade you would expect that they have the construction pretty well down.

Second, if you have this truck you definitely want the V6.  This engine is responsive, has a good amount of torque, and has enough high end acceleration to meet NORMAL people's needs.  It lets out a very satisfying growl when you hit the gas.

What else is good?

The premium stereo system is definitely good for volume and quality and the speakers are positioned quite well for maximizing the acoustic experience.

The brakes are solid and responsive.  The anti-lock breaks I must admit have saved my life several times as I drive often in icy and snowy environs in the winter and early spring.  

Although this is a 4WD vehicle a good set of 4 premium snowtires is certainly recommended in the winter if you live in a cold climate.

I  have had no (REPEAT NO) failures of any parts that would indicate shoddy worksmanship.  I have had 2 warranty repairs done which are a result of a timing error in the transmission system but they were done quickly and efficiently and fixed permanently.

The leather seats are very nice as well and provide good lumbar support for longer trips.  The interior decor, while minimalist, is impressive and quite easy to keep clean.

The premium wheels get rave reviews from everybody that looks at them and the body paint keeps a nice glossy shine even when it has not been cleaned and waxed regularly.

The 4WD is very good and the transfer process is easy.  This has been vastly improved in the past decade and the jeep people really know their stuff with this.

The things that are wrong with the Cherokee are things that I think everybody should know about but not necessarily reasons to not buy it.  You just should walk into it with your eyes open:

they are:

Heat and Air Conditioning.  The climate control is rudimentary.  Heat often comes in unevenly and plan on changing the settings several times on trips during extreme weather.  You will overshoot and have to compensate several times.  

Storage:  there is a severe problem with internal closed storage.  The glove compartment can hold little more than a videotape due to its awkward position under the airbag.  The center console can hold about 6 CDS, some tapes and your registration and license.  There is no change dish at all, which is damn annoying on toll roads.  The only other storage is under the back seat.  Good luck if you have passengers back there.

Back doors:  They are funky shaped and very difficult ot get in and out of especially for both very short and very tall people.  Legroom is quite good but entrance and exit is a pain.  The middle seat belt also tends to get lost somewhere underneath.

Rear Window:  tends to get extremely dirty especially in snowy conditions when dirt is on the road.  visibility gets greatly reduced even though there is the back wiper.

Trip Onboard Computer:  Never seems to get the correct distance til empty figured out.  It is supposed to be approx 15 city/20 highway, but the max distance on a 20 gal tank is about 340 according to the computer.  The local jeep dealer has said that it is not generally calibrated accurately and should not be depended on as the cruising range is much greater generally.  (I once refilled my tank with the emergency light on, and found out that it was still 25% filled)

Handling and Ride:  This is the biggest issue.  The car feels very light and weighs in at a meager 1.5tons.  It is skinny and rather tall.  Crosswinds really can push it laterally badly.  YOu need to go really slowly on turns and curves or you will risk rolling.    There is also an annoying vibration on the door if you lean your left leg against it while driving and i have experienced this in every jeep that I have driven.

Idling noise:  This car idles very loud.  The fan will engage about every 90 seconds and is even louder.  The V6 while making satisfying kickass noise also makes dissatisfying noise at night and wakes the neighbors.

Road noise:  This car is not very well insulated from road noise.  Your ride will be loud, louder with snow tires.




Oh something else.  i blew out a tire 2 weeks ago and had to use jeep roadside service at 2:45am on a sunday.  They answered immediately and were very courteous, understanding, and responsive.  I was in a rural area and they got me help in under 20 minutes.  I was VERY impressed.



None of what I wrote is meant to dissuade a buyer, but to educate one.  I love my jeep and dote over it.  I spend hours cleaning the interior leather and I kiss it goodnight when I put it in the garage each nite.  I will buy a jeep after this one runs its course as well, and after that too.  

Hopefully somebody will find this helpful.
