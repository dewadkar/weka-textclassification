            It seems like I am the only one who actually owns and uses this camera since I have been reading so many inaccuracies in the other opinions.
I don't want to go into all the details.
But a couple:

The camera sells for US $ 3,000.- and not for 4,000.-
It shows that some just copied the recommended selling price from Fuji's PR piece.
The camera has only 3.1 megapixel. The rest is software.
The camera does not use 4 lithium batteries. 
Compared to other digital cameras, this one doesn't use a lot of batteries.
It uses 2 lithium batteries, 4 AA batteries and one button battery.
The lithium batteries are lasting very long unless you are using the in-build flash very often. The 4 AA batteries last for abut 200 to 300 exposures depending on how often and how long you are using the LCD screen.

The Fujifilm Finepix S1 pro is a very fine camera.
It makes fantastic pictures with very accurate color reproduction.
I am using it for professional purposes like catalogs and postcards.
The files are good enough for 4 color print (8.5&quot; x 6&quot;).

It is very easy to handle.
I can only recommend the Fujifilm Finepix S1 pro to anybody who needs professional quality pictures and doesn't have the Us $ 20,000.- a better camera would cost.
