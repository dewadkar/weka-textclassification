            Have owned Kodak digital cameras for nearly 4 years and have used them to take over 1500 pictures. My last camera was a Kodak DC200 (SEE REVEIW) that I bought refurbished from Kodak. I loved my camera, but as technology and times change, it was time for an upgrade. 

FINDING THE RIGHT CAMERA 

The main reason I wanted to upgrade was better resolution. My old camera was a 1.3 Mega pixel camera and I wanted one that had a better resolution. I knew from previous experience that I wanted to zoom lens on my new camera. I did some research and found out that digital zoom is okay, but optical zoom is better. I also wanted a camera that used compact flash memory cards because I could use the old cards from my previous camera and it is so easy just to slap a new flash card in after you have filled one with pictures. A few more features that I wanted were a delay7 timer and the ability to attach the camera to a tripod. 

I'll be honest, I went to ebay and started looking and saw prices and features all across the spectrum. I then decided to go back to an old friend at the Kodak refurbished digital camera section and found what I was looking for... the Kodak Dx 3600. 

The Kodak Dx 3600 2.2 mega pixel camera that has 2x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom. The camera has 8mb of internal storage and takes compact flash cards also. Included are a delay timer, tripod adapter hole and a LCD screen. One big plus for the Dx3600 was that the lens cap is built in, it was such a pain to remove the lens cap take your picture and then try and find the lens cap again with my old camera. I've had the wind blow the lens cap away when I just set it down while taking a picture and had a child pick it up one time. I almost forgot to include that this camera can shoot small videos with audio in the QuickTime format. 

LIKES 

This camera takes great pictures. The highest resolution is 1800x1200, the lowest is 900x600. I also like the zoom lens, the digital zoom is okay but the optical portion is great. I like the video abilities of the camera a lot. The high video resolution is 320x240 and the low-resolution video is 160x120. I have used it to send short clips to each of my childï¿½s grandparents and they absolutely adore it. The LCD screen is easy to use and is adjustable so that it isn't on all the time to conserve battery life. The setup menu is so simple that a child could have the camera setup in minutes and start taking pictures. Of course, this Dx3600 also comes with red eye flash reduction, a programmable flash, and a close up setting for small close up pictures. The Dx3600 downloads pictures very fast due to its USB int3erface. My old DC200 would take forever and this camera is very, very fast! 

DISLIKES 

Unfortunately there are few things that I don't really care for on this camera. The camera has a funny feel to it. I believe that the camera feels funny due to it being rounded in the front and not flat like my old camera. Another dislike is that Kodak only wants you to use lithium or CRV3 batteries in the camera. I ended up buying rechargeable lithium batteries that cost more than the alkaline rechargeable that was in the old camera. The biggest dislike is that Kodak didn't design an A/C adapter for this camera. Kodak wants you to buy the Easy Share Docking Station to recharge the batteries and download the pictures at the same time. 

EASY SHARE DOCKING STATION 

The Easy Share Docking Station hooks up to your computer via a USB cable that is supplied with your digital camera. A set of Kodak rechargeable batteries are also included with the docking station to that when the Dx3600 is placed into the docking station the batteries are recharged. One touch of a button and the pictures are downloaded into your computer. I use Windows XP professional (SEE REVIEW) so I didn't load any of the Kodak software onto my computer. I like the Easy Share concept, but the Easy Share Docking Station is way overpriced!! Kodak sells the docking station with a set of rechargeable batteries for $79.00. 


BOTTOM LINE 

I really like the Dx3600 more than I thought I would. The camera takes high quality pictures and video. Buy the Easy Share docking station and an extra set of batteries and this will be a great setup for almost every household.

UPDATE/NEWSFLASH 12 AUG 02

I was looking at the Kodak Dx3600 on ebay and found out that Kodak is selling the refurbished cameras on their ebay store and the price for the Dx3600 was $199, I had paid $239 on the Kodak on-line store! I shot Kodak an email asking for a refund of the difference of $40 and they said yes. If you want to buy this camera, Kodak's ebay store is the place to look.
