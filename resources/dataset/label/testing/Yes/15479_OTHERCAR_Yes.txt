            The Sony Mavica FD88 is a terrific digital camera, especially for someone new to cameras and not necessarily extremely Computer literate like myself. It takes great shots and the floppy disk storage medium is very easy to use and download to your PC. While its rated 1.3 million pixels is not as high as some other high level models from other manufacturers, in reality not too many people are going to appreciate much of a difference; the pictures look great, crystal clear, and very professional. Well worth the price if your serious about great quality. Im very glad i got it.
