            OK, I, like most people, did exhaustive research, went to stores, played with every camera I could, listened to every sales person's pitch - and came away going for broke - and brought the S70 Cybershot.  Even though it was expensive (list $899, street about $700+)I think it was worth it.  I have now had the camera for about 9 months - and I deliberately waited a while before posting my thoughts.  My finalists were the Nikon Coolpix 900, the Cybershot 505 and the S70.  I finally went with the S70 because the body design was compact, relative to the 505 (and at the time the max pixel res was 2.1 on the 505) and the fact that I have other memory stick products including a Sony Vaio computer.  If you believe in the flash memory / technology convergence concept Sony has taken with all these different products you will NOT be disappointed.

Ok, the good.  Picture quality is outstanding, period.  The optics of the Carl Zeiss lens are just amazing.  The MPEG feature is fun but only has limited usage.  The self timer works very well (if you dare to let it out of your hands!) and the navigation system for all the other functions / features of the camera, once you get the hang of it, is sooo intuitive even a child can operate it.  The 2.5 LCD is wonderful to have available but is completely useless in full sunlight (for all cameras) so having a view finder becomes critical if you are going to be using the camera in daylight - and who wouldn't?  I highly recommend buying a digital camera with a view finder.  It has become a lot more important an option than I thought it would be. And finally the memory stick technology.  As mentioned before I have several Sony products that use this solid state technology - and I am totally sold.  Yes, no one else (with the exception of Epson) has adapted it, but then again there doesn't seem to be any concensus of a clear leader in the flash memory arena anyway.  I love it because I can go from one product to another, load hundreds(!!!) of images in seconds using the memory stick with my Vaio and boom I'll in business - and with the freebie offer you get from Sony's Imagestation.com you get 50 free (sort of - you pay postage and only get 10 a month for 5 months) prints which also got me hooked on prints from the camera.  PS - prints need a lot of resolution the bigger the trim size you want.  So if you are going to want say, 8x10's of certain photos, go all the way up the resolution scale to max (something like 2180x1540?).  But for everyday point and shot photo taking the 1280x960 resolution is just fine.  The built in flash can be a bit tricky but if you are attempting to take a picture in portrait framing (versus normal landscape - holding the camera as is) then you need to know that your hand will get in the way of the flash.  You'll need to test what works best for you, but I found that putting left hand over right positions the flash above the subject (as well as your hand) and so many times I end up with right hand over left with the flash below the subject, which can also help correct red eye depending on your angle. One other nefty feature is the camera comes with A/V output cables - so if you have a TV or VCR with direct inputs you can watch / view your images from the camera on your TV.  A very neat feature.

Ok, now the bad.  It's not painful but important.  Right out of the box the camera was broken.  I freaked. Sony was great.  They had me back in business within a week - although I thought it extreme to have it services rather than just giving me a new one - but whatever.  It came back quick and works perfectly.  Ok, what else.  Well the one thing I really don't like is the time it takes the camera to set up a shot.  I call it the "photo ready" process.  As you get ready to take a picture, you push down the button half way, the camera processes the image (which takes just under a second) beeps that its ready and then you press the button down completely and the shot is captured.  If I have anything I don't like about this camera its that wait time.  Of course the way around this is to have the camera in ready position but tricking it and holding down the button half way, let it do its thing, and then take your picture when you're ready.  Of course you have to keep pressure on the button to keep it at the half way point - which is a pain - but, if you're waiting for that perfect moment, this is the work around.
