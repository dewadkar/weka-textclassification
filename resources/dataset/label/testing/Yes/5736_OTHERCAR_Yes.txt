            I wanted an Achieva - my husband wanted the 88 Royale - we bought the Royale (new, off the showroom floor).  After 29 days, my husband said that it was up to me whether we kept it or traded it for the Achieva - I threatened HIM with bodily injury!
As I write this, our Olds has 180,000 miles and still counting.  It runs like a top, and we have had no major repairs since owning it.  Oil changes and tires are about all we ever did to it.  
This car is a joy to drive or ride in - LOTS of room, quiet, and it has a BENCH seat in the front (if you put the armrest up!).  It's one of the few six passenger cars left out there!
There is basically nothing to hate about this vehicle, and every 88 owner I have spoken to loves theirs as much as I love mine.  If there is one &quot;hate&quot;, it's that Olds stopped making it!<br><br>
