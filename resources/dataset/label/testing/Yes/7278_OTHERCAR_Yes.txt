            <b>Introduction</b>

The Olympus D-460 Zoom is a great 1.3 megapixel camera for the price.  The package includes the camera, and 8Mb Smart Media card, a serial cable, video out cable, batteries, software, and a hand strap.  The camera itself is about a normal size camera.  It�s not as tiny compared to the some of the other digital cameras out there, but it feels good when you hold it.  The flash flips up from one of the corners of the camera and pulling the front shutter to the side exposes the lens.  The back of the camera has a 1.8 inch color LCD screen and several buttons to navigate through the menus.

<b>Features</b>

This camera has a ton of features.  It has a 3x optical zoom and 2x digital zoom.  You can set the configuration of the camera in many different ways depending on you picture taking conditions.  You can adjust to different shutter speeds, account for lighting conditions, have six different types of flash modes, and an automatic mode if you don�t want to change settings manually.   Some of the more interesting features are the panorama mode and a rapid ten shots in a row.  The video out option is very useful for viewing photo collections on television rather than a computer screen.

<b>Quality</b>

Picture quality is great at the best resolution JPEG compressed.  At 1280 x 960 resolution, the pictures are sharp and bright.  Pictures take a couple seconds to save at the best resolution, but at lower resolution the turnover rate is almost instant.   The LCD screen is good also, but is hard to see in direct sunlight.  The 3x optical zoom works great and makes taking pictures much easier.  I do not use 2x digital zoom very much because it seems to reduce the quality of the picture.  

Battery life seems to be a great concern for prospective digital camera buyers.  Other reviewers seem to have a problem with the battery life of this camera.  I have taken over 200 pictures over a month with this camera and I am still on the original set of batteries.  The battery life still indicates full!  Battery life depends greatly on how much you use the LCD screen.  I use it minimally, usually only to take close up pictures.  

The Camedia software included with the camera has some editing options, but is used mainly as a viewer.  It creates thumbnails of images for easy viewing.  Its editing options are basic, so use a program like Photoshop do major work on your photos.

<b>Problems</b>

The only major problem with the camera is that it does not support USB.  It uses a serial connection to upload which can be VERY slow.  Buying a Smart Media card reader will speed thing up greatly.  I also do not like the slide open design for the lens very much.  You have to wait several seconds for the lens to go out every time you slide the cover open, and you have to wait several seconds for the lens to go back in when you slide the cover closed.

<b>Overall</b>

Overall, this is a great beginner digital camera.  It has tons of options on the camera.  I feel that a camera like this helps people become better photographers since you can experiment with different configurations.  Feedback from your photos are also instant by looking through the LCD screen.  Expect to buy a few accessories if you get this camera or any other digital camera.  A bigger Smart Media card around 32 Mb would be a good purchase to lessen the number of times you have to upload.  A USB Smart Media reader/writer would also be very convenient to have and made those uploads speedy.  An AC adapter is also a good option to help save battery life during times such as viewing photos on your television.
