            I have been shooting digital using an Olympus 620L since 98, just biding my time until an SLR came around that was near what I could afford.

Finally the Canon 10D came on the market.  I purchased this camera in July of 03 and have now shot over 3000 images with it.  This camera comes packed with all types of goodies and is amazing.

I find the button positions to be easy to get to, and the camera itself feels as if it is well constructed.  I currently use a 512 CF card which gives me plenty of room and a 28-200 Tamron Zoom lens with it.  I recommend using a separate card reader to transfer images from the CF card to your computer.  It is faster to transfer that way, and you save on the battery usage.

I have found I can take over 500 images before my battery needs recharging, and recharging the battery is pretty quick.  Some might find the weight and size of the camera a draw back, but I like it.  I finally am getting use to using the creative controls on the camera (white balance, aperture, shutter, etc).  I primarily use the camera for actions photography, and find the automatic focusing and burst modes work well.  I must admit however, it does take a little time getting use to it.

The camera came packaged with Adobe Photoshop Elements, and a couple of proprietary file viewer programs.  Make sure your computer has plenty of ram as they do eat up resources and also hard drive space.

I also did some shooting of the night sky, and the noise element was very low.  This was using iso 1500 and a shutter speed of 30 seconds.
