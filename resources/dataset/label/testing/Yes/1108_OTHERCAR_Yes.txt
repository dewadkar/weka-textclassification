            This was my parents' vehicle, and I drove it for the two years before I bought my own. I was always nervous going around corners, since it feels as though it will tip over at any speed greater than 20 MPH. I was disproven last winter when I had my first accident, turning a corner on an icy road. The truck didn't flip like I thought it would, however the brakes failed and I hit 3 trees at 45 MPH, totaling the truck. The brakes have since been recalled, so if you buy this vehicle make sure they have been updated to current safety standards. The solid steel construction of the front and side saved my life; I walked away from the crash without so much as a bruise. 

Everyday observances:
This vehicle
*Has a HUGE backseat with more than ample leg room, great for long trips
*Tends to always feel like it's going to flip
*Is hell to parallel park, as it barely even fits in a standard parking space
*Accelerates with impressive speed
*Is slow to stop
*Has so much room in the back, it easily held a bike, dorm fridge, 3 large plants, a microwave, an end table, a desk, and ALL my clothing and stuff for college - without even folding down the back seat.<br><br>
