            I have owned at least 8 or 10 other cameras thru the years. In the 70's and 80's I used several 35mm SLR's, then got lazy and have had several 35mm point and shoot auto everything cameras. On two occasions I tried out APS format cameras, the latest being the Canon Elph 370Z. The APS format cannot hold a candle to 35mm for overall picture quality, but the  size and feel of the Elph made up for some of the lost points. It's failure was in the flash department...totally inadequate and inconstant. But the size, look and feel of the Elph was wonderful, thus I tried out the Digital Elph S100. This camera is great. Point and shoot and 90% of the time you get an excellent photo. The inferior flash is not as much a problem with digital cameras....I guess they work much like camcorders in that department. I think anything less than a 2 megapixel digital will not give the results that a 35mm gives and anything over that is overkill for the typical person taking 4x6 snapshots. This camera is replacing a $200 Olympus point and shoot 35mm that has been an excellent camera, but didn't take a drop off a 10 foot balcony very well. When you shoot at the default resolution and reduce to 4x6 inch, you will see a sharper 4x6 than any point and shoot 35mm I have sed. To get 10 photo album &quot;keepers&quot;, I would shoot maybe 20 to 30 shots, discarding 2/3 of them. With this format, you only get printed the ones you want. This camera, like any small camera produces bad &quot;red eye&quot; with the flash, but with the Adobe Photo Shop that comes with it, you remove the &quot;red eye&quot; with just a few clicks of the mouse. Upload your digital files to Amazon's Ofoto and in less than a week you have  beautiful prints. And since you print only the &quot;keepers&quot; it will cost you less in the long run. 

Now back to this camera, Canon doesn't ship it with the neat little leather case that slides on your belt that comes with the other Elphs. The one for the Elph-2 fits it perfect and Amazon has it. The 8MB flash card will give you only about 10 shots, so go ahead and order a 32 or 48MB one. This is a cool camera that you will enjoy likely more than any other camera you have ever had!<br><br>
