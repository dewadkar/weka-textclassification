            Our 1998 Honda Accord EX just turned 15,000 miles, so I believe we can now give an accurate review of this car.  We bought the car as a left over model when the 1999 models were in the showroom.  We were pleased to find one with quite a few nice options that include power roof, full leather, CD player, and very nice allow wheels.  But the real reason we picked this Accord was for a specific safety reason.  

The car is for my wife, and she is just over 5 feet tall.  We test drove nearly every domestic auto in the Accord's price and size range, but only the Accord would accomodate her height in relation to the distance from the steering wheel to her chest.  We were concerned about buying a car that required her to move the seat up so far that she would be dangerously close to the airbag.  We have heard of injuries because of this and wanted to avoid the problem. Only the Accord had the proper geometry so that when she moved the seat all the way forward she was still more than 10 inches from the steering wheel.

Our Accord has the 4 cylinder engine with the 4 speed auto trans.  It's not fast, but it accelerates well enough to merge with traffic.  It does tend to get a bit noisy at high RPMs.  Fuel economy is great, although we haven't figured it out exactly.  It handles well and is fun to drive on the twisty roads near our neighborhood.

The seats are comfortable, both front and rear. We recently took my parents from Detroit to Toronto and back, with them both in the rear seats for 4 hours each way, with very few complaints other than just being sick of driving. That may be the ultimate comfortability test.  The driver's seat is firm but well shaped.  It doesn't make my ass numb on long trips and it is very adjustable.

Trunk space is pretty good, and there is a center pass-thru that doubles as an armrest for the back seat.

Overall this is a great car.  We have really enjoyed driving it.  It is a good combination of sporty and luxury at a price we could afford.<br><br>
