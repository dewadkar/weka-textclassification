            I purchased this car new in May 1990. TSI/AWD White with black top, cloth interioir. The Talon replaced my 1989 Firebird. A great all seanon car for a single guy or married guy with no kids. This car did it all on all types of road surfaced in all kinds of conditions, dry, wet, snow, etc... The only problem was the shifter needed regular attention with a special lube that Eagle never got right. It caused shifting to be somewhat harsh at times.Other than that this was a problem free car fr me through 64,000 miles. I owned it for 4 years and sold it when I got married and bought a sedan in it's place. I really miss that car!! When buying one used, be sure to determine oil changes were done regularly as this is most important of all when shopping a turbo-powered car. I canged mine every 2,500 religiously.During the time I owned it, I did "street" it a few times. It was always a winner. Victime included a S.C. T-bird, a 5.0 mustang (on wet pavement) an numerous imports.... Again, a great car to buy used if the seller has maintence records to go with the car...
