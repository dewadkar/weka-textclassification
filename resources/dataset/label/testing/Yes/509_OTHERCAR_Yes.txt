            This is a superb camera, it has a solid comfortable feel and the controls are well placed. After getting proficient with its features, we took it on a trip to Yellowstone for a true workout. The camera is capable of much, although to get the most bang for the buck I strongly recommend getting thoroughly familiar with the menus & controls so that field adjustments become second nature. Its really a simple machine, once a person learns it. I used to shoot a lot of 35mm but started the transition to digital a few years ago & have not looked back since! Digital is the only way to go. 

My wife & I shot 1000+ images on our recent trip with the 2100 & each nite we would rough edit the results on a
laptop, deleting the obvious bad shots. We wound up bringing home about 300 'semi-final' images, most shot in the medium res mode. (imagine the dollar savings in film & processing)  I like to use 32mb cards, these are easier for me to keep track of & also in the event of the loss of a card I don't loose too many pics. I found the image stabilization to work great, hand held tele shots in bright light were very good. I left the digital zoom feature activated, as its easy to see when the camera enters digital zoom by a sliding scale in the viewfinder. Shooting wild life in the field, we found ourselves dipping into digi zoom a lot. Results were good, but its best to use max res mode when doing so. We got some killer shots!

The 10X optical zoom is of course superb and the chief reason I bought the cam. The threaded lens readily accepts various filters (UV, Polarizing, etc) Another nice feature is the 4 sec sound byte that can be attached to a picture. It can be switched on or off easily & gives realism, identity, or just fun to special shots. I found the cam mike to be sensitive & true. I like this feature. Sound playback is via the supplied Camedia software or can also be accessed by any media player. Short videos with sound (suitable for email) are also easy to make & download but require the Camedia software or Quicktime to view.

Battery life I feel is very good, all digi cams like to eat them, but a couple sets of NiMH will last the whole day with a little common sense. I kept 3 sets with me, but never did have to get into more that 2. Low lite shots were also very good providing you could see the image thru the EVF, this is my only real complaint. The viewfinder works reasonably well with low light, but in a candle lit room its impossible to see an image thru it. One saving feature is the infra-red auto focus device that will keep what ever you point the cam at in crisp focus (even in total darkness), it also acts as a 'laser' rifle site of sorts, and even in total darkness acts like a pointing device. I found this very helpful when using flash in close, almost dark situations. Speaking of flash, I found it to be OK, but a tendency to washout at very close ranges. I don't use flash too much other than for fill, so this never really became a problem. 

The controls are easy to use, as is the menu once you get familiar with it. There is a full reset to default settings just past the 'On-Off' lever which at first I thought to be a poor design, in practical use however I think it may have been done on purpose. I found myself actually using the reset when I needed a quick shot with normal camera defaults, this after I had the settings customized for a special shot. That came in handy more than once. Again, get familiar with the cam as much as possible before using it on serious shoots. Also, the automatics are very, very good, and it may be best to let the cam adjust itself as much as possible. I got myself into trouble several times by trying to get too creative with manual selections. One feature that I really liked was the ease of adjusting exposure up or down in small increments without having to go to the menu. Also, you can view as much or as little data in the viewfinder with the mere push of a button. The camera also lets you view previous shots through the viewfinder which is a Godsend in bright light.

After using this camera a lot, I love it more and more & am at a loss finding anything better at this time at any price.The megapixel nonsense can cloud a camera's true ability, 2.1 with the 2100UZ has proved to be more than adequate. Keep in mind that the higher the pixel count the less images that will fit on a card and also the more cumbersome they will be to handle on the computer. Considering that most film pics are kept at 5x7or less, a medium image size of 1024x768 is more than enough. At max res the camera is capable of 99% of what ever blow-ups most anyone would ever want. You can select & set the 'SQ' image size setting  to the custom resolution that you prefer, although 640x480 is the default, I keep mine set to 1024x768. 

Downloads to my computer directly from the cam worked flawlessly, however I much prefer to use a stand alone card reader, eg: Lexar. I also use this camera on a small tripod for digitizing hand written documents and also old photographs on to disk, the macro works great. Being able to select black & white imaging is also nice. These are only some of the great features. Highly recommend it!
