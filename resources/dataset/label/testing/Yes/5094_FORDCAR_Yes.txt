              Sure, when you think of your dream car, you don't think &quot;Ford Taurus,&quot; but this car is a great alternative for those of us who do not have piles of money waiting to be spent.  
  I have owned my 1997 Ford Taurus for about a year now, and I got it from a company that used it as a company car.  So far, I have had next to no problems at all from it and it is just reaching 80,000 miles.  I think it is definitely a nice, practical car.  
  I just came home from college a week ago, and I was able to fit all my stuff in the trunk and back seat.  It has plenty of room, comfortably seating 5 people.  The seats are nice and comfortable, it has all the good features such as cruise, AC, power everything, and adjustable seats.  The only problem I have had so far is that the back left window will not roll down, but the car still runs great.  
  It accelerates relatively fast, it is small enough to where I can parallel park it easily, it gets good gas mileage, and it takes corners very well.  I would definitely recommend this car as a family car or just a practical car for someone looking for a reliable automobile that will not let them down.      <br><br>
