                 I do not own this vehicle, but I know many that do.  And every single one have them have raved about this spectacular piece of machinery.  Not only does this thing grip the curves like super glue, it looks like a million dollars and is safe.  You can purchase the Z3 with air bags on the sides of the doors so if it from the side the air bag will block your head from a serious impact on the side of the door.  A very smart idea, in my opinion.
  
     I think maybe the only thing wrong with this vehicle is that it is a bit small and in a crash it would be a little dangerous, especially if the other automobile was larger.  Even though I do not own one I have been blessed with the experience of driving it.  Thanks to my some of my friends and cousins.  The ride is exceptionally smooth, easy steering, fast acceleration and a comfortable trip.
  
     I wouldn't recommend this for a first car, maybe a second.  It's a little too fast for someone just learning how to drive, and it can be a lot to handle.  And you definitely wouldn't want to wreck this master piece.  And I wouldn't recommend it for a family car, since it only sits two people.  But for 30-42 grand you are getting a great price for such a wonderful car.  I love BMW's and this one is probably my first pick.   <br><br>
