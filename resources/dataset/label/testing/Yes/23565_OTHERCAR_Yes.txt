            My older brother bought a Chevrolet C/K 1500 King Cab.He drive's this pickup every where he travels.I asked him what made you want to buy such a big pickup truck.He replies I can move my stuff easier with this truck.He goes on saying you know being in the army you do get transfer to a lot of different place's.Plus it help's for really hauling any thing you need to.I agree with him because when ever I need some thing hauled a way I call him up.He said this pickup was the best investment I could ever spent his money on and I agree with him.So,if you are wanting a good quality truck that is wroth your money I suggest you look at the Chevrolet C/K 1500 King Cab pickup at your local Chevrolet Dealer.<br><br>
