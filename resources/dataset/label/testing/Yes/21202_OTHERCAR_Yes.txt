            For those of you wanting great picture quality, ease of use and lots of photographic fun at an affordable price, this is the camera for you!  Although I've had this camera only since Christmas, I've fallen in love with it.  It took tons of research and a great leap of faith for me to move from the 35mm world of photography to the digital world, but boy am I glad I did it.

The 4330 is small enough to fit in a purse or pouch and go almost anywhere you need to take pictures.  It isn't a compact camera that will fit on your keychain or watch pocket, but it's no bigger than a simple, basic 35mm model and weighs about the same as well.

The LCD screen is not the biggest of the models offered, but large enough and with enough resolution to make quick judgments on keeping the shot or re-shooting it.  The screen is plenty bright and using the menu selections couldn't be more intuitive.

<b>Taking Pictures</b>
Shooting a good picture is barely different from the techniques of a 35mm.  One difference is the camera's method of light sensing and focusing.  In order for the camera to best detect the light conditions and focus on your intended target, you should aim and press the shutter button half-way.  The camera will tell you when it is ready by blinking a green light on the back and turning the target brackets in the view screen from green to red.  Then you can press the button the rest of the way down and snap the shot.  This whole procedure adds about 3/4 of a second to the picture taking process.  Shutter lag is not uncomfortably long at all.  I'm not sure about the exact speed, but it hasn't annoyed me yet, so it must be within my window of acceptable performance, and I've been conditioned by 35mm cameras.

The camera seems to need slightly more light than my 35mm model, but it comes equipped with a low-light setting and light correction settings that can be set easily once you become familiar with how the menu works.  You should read the manual to best grasp how to use these features.  So far I've been able to produce great pictures at almost any light level I've encountered, even at night outdoors.  And if you do run into a situation where you can't get enough light, you can always adjust the picture digitally on your PC.

<b>Features</b>
Other features of the camera are easy to use.  The flash mode is controlled by a separate button, and the zoom is controlled by an easy to access button at the top right of the camera body.  The preview button is separate and quickly loads the most recent picture.  You can scroll through all the pictures stored on the camera with the circular navigation button on the left side of the body.  Deleting unwanted pictures is easy as well and controlled by a <i>delete</i> button.  But just to make sure you don't make a mistake, you have to press the <i>ok</i> button to finish the deal.

One feature I may use in the future is additional lenses.  The 4330 comes ready to handle a threaded lens if you have special wide angle or close-up needs.  This is a cool feature not very many digital cameras have at this price.

<b>Picture Quality</b>
This was the most important issue (along with price) to me as I researched the available cameras.  And I've been completely satisfied.  I've taken equivalent pictures with my 4330 and my old 35mm camera and the results are amazingly similar.  As I said before, at lower light, the 4330 suffers, but only slightly.  Yet the consistency of quality is squarely in the 4330's favor.  This is with the camera at its <i>BEST</i> setting.  Next I'm going to begin testing lower level settings to increase capacity.  Speaking of capacity, I purchase a 64 MB SD Flash card for $32 online through Amazon and it holds 49 shots at the top setting.

<b>Digital Fun</b>
Once you've packed your flash card full of memorable shots, you're going to want to dump them into your trusty PC for enhancement, emailing, printing and more. Well, it's a breeze. No manual necessary. Once you've loaded the supplied Kodak software, you can set the download to begin automatically when the camera is connected to the PC or have it prompt you and let you decide when to begin the process. Either way, dumping a whole batch of pictures takes only a few minutes and they are instantly available for viewing/editing...etc. Here's where I have some complaints. The Kodak software does not display the pictures in the best resolution/quality. Pictures appear "glassy" or "shiny". I know that's difficult to visualize, but it is actually nothing to be worried about. Viewing the same files with different packages produced crisp, colorful, vibrant pictures that are stunning in their clarity. When I had these shots printed at Wal-Mart, I was delighted to see that my pictures rivaled those of any 35mm camera I've ever used. There's obviously some flaw in the Kodak software that does not represent the data correctly and does not translate to prints at all. 

That said, the rest of the software gets and A-plus.  Browsing is easy and intuitive.  Each new download of shots is placed in a file of its own, dated for easy storage.  Editing pictures is simple, especially the redeye reduction tool.  And by the way, the 4330 does seem to produce more redeye than I'm comfortable with.  I'm now using the redeye reduction flash setting and I still have to blot out the "evil eye" when a target is caught staring at the camera.  But at least the tool is easy to use.  All you have to do is open the file for editing, click the "redeye" button, position the cursor over the offending eye and click.  The software targets the entire eye and blots out the red without you having to do it pixel by pixel.

You can create photo albums and send emails and print pictures right from this program, but I do not use these features.  I'm a burn to CD or flash card and print at Wal-Mart kind of guy.

I should note also that I do not use the 4330 base, which retails for about $75.  Unless you wish to blow $75, <b>DO NOT BUY THIS</b>.  Downloading via the supplied cable through a USB is just too easy.  I know, I know, the TV add shows how simple it is to snap a shot, plop the camera into it's little holder, press one button and the pic is on its way to Mom's house.  Well, my friend, if you REALLY need that level of simplicity, then go ahead and blow the $75.

I also purchased a multi-card ready for $20, which allows me to pull the card from the camera and load/download pictures directly to the PC without using the camera's batteries.  And it can be used for other purposes, like transferring data to my PDA or other PC's.  At $75, Kodak is simply gouging customers for an item that is at best one-dimensional.

<b>Battery Life</b>
Here's where my short experience with the 4330 doesn't allow me a genuine conclusion.  So far I'm still using the Lithium battery that came stock with the camera, and after around 200 shots it still has a good charge.  I purchased four rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger for the day when the Lithium dies.  The camera runs on two of these NiMH units or the single Li unit.  And I do use the view screen quite a bit--just because it's cool.

Well, I hope my review is helpful in aiding you in making a digital camera decision.  I must have read dozens of these reviews before I made my decision, and I recommend you do the same.
