               I had been needing a new car. A larger, family vehicle that could be taken on camping trips and carry along all of my family members. I had had my eyes on the Ford Explorer for a while, but I wasn't sure if that was what I was going to decide on. 

    I went to the car lot and looked around. They had Expeditions, Excursions, and Explorers everywhere, but I decided to test drive an Explorer. Once I got into the drivers seat, I realized that I was going to buy this one.

   I love my Explorer. It's a large, family car and I always have room for groceries and other things that have to go in there. It drives very smoothly and is incredibly comfortable. It drives smoothly on any type of road and is easy to handle in rain and sleet. Really, there's nothing I can say that I hate about it, it's a great vehicle.

   Anyone with a large family should buy an Explorer. Anyone who is constantly having to carry large loads like groceries, baseball equipment, etc., should have an Explorer. And, last but not least, anyone who takes a lot of road trips. But, you don't have to be one of these types of people to enjoy an Explorer. I recommend it to anyone. It's a great vehicle and I think that everyone would love it if they had one.<br><br>
