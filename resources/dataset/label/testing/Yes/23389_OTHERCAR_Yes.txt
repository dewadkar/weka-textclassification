            The DC-3800 is a great little digital camera for amateurs or nervous photographers. It democratizes photography - allowing the photographically challenged to take amazingly good photographs. Its reasonable price makes it affordable even to poor Aussies buying it in duty free and waiting impatiently to cross customs and rip it out of the case.
It cost me A$700 duty free, including a battery charger with multiple plugs for international travel, and additional PCMIAA card.

Remember to get those international plug adaptors if you are travelling overseas. Another good buy was the PCMIA card reader, this enables one to quickly rip the memory card out of the camera, stick into the reader, and attach it to the PCMIA port on your laptop, and view the photos in your graphics program. Because, this is one drawback, the 8 MB card fills up rapidly, only about 10 photos at "Best" Quality. But you can delete snaps that you really don't like on the spot.

The LCD at the back is a great tool, you can use it in lieu of the teensy weensy viewfinder. But this eats up your batteries, so carry enough recharged batteries with you if you are out for the day. I quickly got used to the view finder, as I didn't want the hassle of carrying batteries about. Talk about laziness, those batteries are tiny..but hey.
 
The LCD also gives you access to viewing and deleting the photos on the card. So you can delete the lousy ones, and keep the good ones..thats the trick to taking really good photos, keep snapping away.

You can download photos in three ways:
1. Use the PCMIAA port and card as described
2. Use the card reader that attaches to the USB port. ( Installation and graphics software comes on an included CD)
3. Use the supplied cable to view the photos on your TV..this is great for showing snaps to Granma, or if you have forgotten your spectacles! 

The 8 MB card that is the standard one supplied is really very small, I will buy a larger one, 16 MB perhaps pretty soon..or if I intend to travel without my laptop. Of course you can optimise this by choosing photos to be taken at "good" or "better resolution". These are pretty good too if you are just taking personal snaps.

There are heaps of other feature, red eye reduction, digital zoom, controllable flash, and so on that are really good functions.

The best thing about the camera are its very cool looks and curvy feel. Its metallic, but nicely curved to fit the hand, no harsh edges here. Its tiny too, so you better have nimble fingers, and be careful with those manicured fingernails. 

All in all, I am very happy with my superb photos of Golden Gate bridge, Niagara Falls ( though I had to take off my gloves to get the photos..brrr), and of family and friends. Its easy to use, and has a pleasantly geeky look and feel to it.

AND, you can allow the kids to take as many snaps as they like as nothings wasted..so you don't have to discipline excited kids..its the answer to happy outings with kids. So one camera, many uses, much happinesses..
