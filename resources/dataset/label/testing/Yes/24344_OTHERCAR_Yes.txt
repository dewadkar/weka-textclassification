            I've been an avid Ford fan for years, and traded a '98 Ford F150 on my 2000 Dodge Dakota SLT Club Cab V6.  I should say that I was only unhappy with the Ford mainly for size and the fact that I had a manual transmission.

I wanted the Dakota because of size, looks and the equipment that was standard on it, and have not been disappointed at all.

I read in a magazine that it was a gas hog, and I will say that it doesn't get the best of mileage but I didn't buy it for that or I'd have looked for a four cylinder.

I've hauled mulch and anything else that is needed for maintenance around my house, or church, or friends and have never had problem one with it.  I have had two recalls.  One to reprogram the computer and the other for some small piece around the rear axle that Dodge wanted replaced.

The only gripe that I have with the whole vehicle is the fan clutch is engaged almost every day upon start up, and you have to build up a little speed on the road before in disengages.  Up to that point the engine roars a little.  I have asked about this and they tell me it's a new oil that is used in the fan clutch.

I can certainly live with this, when all else has been great.  The CD stereo system is wonderful and it's a pleasure to drive.<br><br>
