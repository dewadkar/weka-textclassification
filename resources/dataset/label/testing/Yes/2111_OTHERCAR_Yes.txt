            The jaguar XJ6-L is a fine example of what a luxury car should be.  The XJ6-L is also one of the most chosen cars by families today.  My jaguar has a straight six cylender engine, the six cylender is also one of the most responsive of the smaller engines.  The engine gets about twenty four miles to the gallon and hasent given me any problems.  The engine is best started out on synthetic oil,  i also wouldn't advise switching oil from original to synthetic because it will burn oil.  

The brake system is also very responsive to the feather.  The brakes don't wear as much as a normal brakes because of the type of brake lubricant.  The jaguar's advanced brake system runs on only mineral oil.  The mineral oil is of very high viscosity so it doesn't wear the pads as much.

The jaguar's interior is very roomy,  the front and back has alot of elbow room.  Your feet are also free from tight places.  The radio is a bose with surround speakers.  The heater is the best,  the heater warms or cools the car in minutes.  

All around, the jaguar is a car for the people who appriciate the joys of a real luxury car and also appriciate style and preformance.  <br><br>
