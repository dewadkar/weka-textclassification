            This summer I purchased the HP PhotoSmart C200. I was always scanning my pictures, and cursed and swore every time I had to run to the store to get the film processed. Several of my friends had digital cameras, and after considerable window shopping I finally bit the bullet and bought one.

The unit I bought, was actually Staples demo model (had never been used, just was out of the box) Who was I to argue with a 25% discount?

Features of the camera:
Up to 1 MegaPixel resolution
2x Digital Zoom
Self timer
Serial PC Connection
Uses Standard CompactFlash memory Cards
8mb CompactFlash memory card included

Included with the camera:
4 AA batteries
PC Serial port to camera interface cable
Cable to connect to TV
Wrist strap
CD with HP software
3-4 dead trees worth of advertising, manuals, registration cards� Yadda Yadda Yadda

Things I love about this product:
This camera is so unbelievably simple to use. It�s literally point and shoot! I gave it to my technically incompetent girlfriend, and she was taking pictures in a matter of minutes!

The 2x zoom is a nice feature, lets me stay a little farther back when I�m taking a picture (but not far enough for my taste)  The choice of resolutions (low-med-high) is great! Some pictures you just don�t need to be very high quality, others you want as high as possible!

Something I�m sure HP will not admit to, lay claim to, or otherwise endorse, is the durability of this camera! I�m a big 4x4 Junkie, I bought the camera for pictures of in shop repairs, and trail action!  Well let me tell you, I�ve abused the hell out of this camera! And it just keeps taking pictures! Its spent innumerable hours in the glove box of my 4x4 (in the heat, the cold, bumpy roads, highways�) Its been dropped in thick pea-soup like mud twice, and it keeps working! I know a few people with other digital cameras who�ve dropped their cameras, while in a protective case, and have had to replace the camera.

Things I hate about the camera:
	The most annoying part of the camera, is the short battery life, When I go out on a trail ride, I end up carrying, 2 spare 32mb memory cartridges, and 12 AA�s. This gets me through the day. I�m told its nowhere near as taxing on batteries with the LCD off, but its so much easier to use with it on! Just a hint, rechargeable alkaline batteries are a godsend!

	The Serial cable transfer to PC is slower than sin! I went out and bought a USB CompactFlash memory card reader. Made the downloading process much quicker! Plus if I�ve got a bunch of cards, I can get both working simultaneously!

I would recommend this camera to anyone who was looking for a good basic digital camera. Its got some of the features of a much nicer camera. Yet is priced low enough that if something does happen to it, it wont hurt so much!
