            Well this is my second chrysler minivan...I had a 99 Gr. Caravan (see review) but traded it for the New 2001 re-design Town and Country.  Alot has changed, for the better!  Lets hope reliability and re-sale gets better with this new generation of minivans.  I bought the Town and Country instead of another Dodge Caravan because the re-sale is better, some extra touches, less on the market, and option packages where easier and more consolidated.  My New T and C was the LX FWD 3.3L model.  I bought the 25k package, which included keyless, power sliding door, 3 tri zone climate, quad seats, split rear bench, power seat, Cd player, 8 speaker stereo, heated mirrors, and some other small features.  The package was 3100.  My Msrp was 28445.  I got it for 22900.  It was a good deal.  Thats without my trade.  I see some people went with the 1k rebate and 5.9% financing.  As a banker, I would suggest to go with the 2k rebate cause if your credit is good, you can get 6% financing through local banks through the dealer for 60 months.  My rate was 6.09% and I got the 2k rebate.  I looked for 2 months to get the deal I wanted and the hard worked paid off.  I love the new van so far, but its still early in ownership.  Let me start with my dodge and that model type.  I had 30k miles on it and had some minor but potentially costly problems if off warranty.  My power windows acted up in the winter but started working find towards spring when I could bring it in, so the dealer couldn't find the problem.  They have worked great since but who knows with winter coming again and my warranty ending.  My transmission was acting up in rare instances but the dealer said they would replace it.  I didnt want to go with that hassel.  My CV joints were making noises for about 2 wks but then stopped, but once again--who knows when that would start again, Dealer couldnt find anything wrong.  I had to replace the brakes at 21k, warped rotors (common with the dodge).  I liked my van and it drove well but it was time.  So I said, forget it!!  Ill get a new one cause the price is right and the new design was a vast improvement and the new options perked my ears.  I love the power sliding door, wishI got 2.  I usually trade my cars every 2-3 yrs anyways, Don't ask why!! I need help! lol.  I picked up my van in mid August.  The new headlights have been a huge difference from the old model.  Sometimes, I would have to shut my lights off and on just to check if I really had my lights on with my old Dodge.  The stereo was improved.  6 speakers compared to 4, better layout, and higher quality sound.  The seats seem firmer, and the power driver seat makes a long drive better.  The split rear seat, new for 2001, is a big plus.  I would never remove my old bench seat, I would look at it and say--I am not lifting that 120lbs seat--no way!  With the split, its so easy to remove, tumble forward, recline, etc.  I wouldnt have bought the van without it!!  Its to priceless to give up.  Most of the 2001 Dodges came with the one piece seat. I found you could get an extra option or two with the dodge for the same price but the resale value, nada is about 1500 2k difference.  It is worth buying the T and C. for that reason.  You will appreciate that 3 or 5 yrs down the road.  The tri zone a/c is great.  You can be cold while the back kids can be warm.  Nice feature.  I hope this van has no problems and can increase its reliability.  I was close to buying the Honda, but for 3k more and less options--I just didnt do it.  Honda has a great record and wish Chrysler will have the same.  This is a great van, and looks sharp.  Enjoy!!
