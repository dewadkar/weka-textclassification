            I purchased a Maxima when I started having problems with an American made car that I owned at the time.  I found this car on the lot as a program car.  I loved the fact that it has a lot of room, in both the front and the back.  It also offered a large trunk.  Compared to other cars that I had owned prior to this, I would rate this car much, much higher.  The ride is quiet, and it is an ideal car to take on long trips.  The Maxima also get really great mileage and is roomy enough for the kids in the backseat.  As far as maintenance on my vehicle, I have only had 2 problems with it, but considering the age of the car and the amount of miles on it, it isn't unusal.  I have had the altenator replaced and the water pump replaced.  Other than those 2 things, this car just required regular maintenance.  I think anyone who wants a great car at a reasonable price, should consider this car as a possible choice for their next car.  <br><br>
