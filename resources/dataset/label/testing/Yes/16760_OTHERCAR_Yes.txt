            Did I really need a new camera?  I only already have two 35mm ones and already had a digital camera.  But I was feeling the need.  After plenty of research and cost comparisons, I went with the Olympus C-4000.  It helped that my old digital camera was an Olympus and I had excellent experience with it (and continue to do so).

Of course everyone, including my boyfriend just rolled their eyes at me and went &#147do you really need a new camera?&#148  Just like they all said when I wanted a new cell phone.  Oh the life of someone who enjoys these kinds of things.  No one else seems to understand your needs.

The C-4000 is a 4.1 mega-pixel camera with a zoom lens.  I&#146d like to think of it as sort of a &#147hybrid&#148 camera type, not quite point and shoot, but not quite an SLR either (no interchangeable lenses for example, but it does have some manual controls).  It gives someone who wants to do more than just snap photos quite a few options to play with and work with.

<b>The Basics</b>

Like I said, this is a 4.1 mega-pixel camera with a 3x zoom lens.  Some highlights of the features (I&#146m not going crazy here, check out the spec sheet if you want all the gory details):

 - It&#146s quite light (just over ï¿½ a pound) and it is easily held in one hand, especially with the design of the case that allows you to wrap your hand around and grab onto the camera (on the side with the shutter release).
 - Several (four) different resolution modes including an uncompressed TIFF mode.  Each mode provides for different sized photos.  In addition, if you have a certified Olympus memory card, you can also take panoramic photos in each mode.
 - Storage is based on the &#147SmartMedia&#148 card (<a href="/content_107691740804">http://www.epinions.com/content_107691740804</a>) and is limited, at this time to a maximum card size of 128 megabytes.  Judging from what is happening to other formats, it appears that the SmartMedia card is a somewhat outdated memory card and it&#146s unlikely that storage amounts will increase on it.
 - Video capture (but no microphone) in the MPEG format
 - Ability to set manual settings for exposures, white balance, shutter speed and more.
 
<b>What does it come with?</b>

The C-4000 comes with 2 lithium LB-01 batteries, a 16 megabyte SmartMedia card (woefully too small), a USB cable and a video (TV) cable, a carrying strap, a lens-cap holder strap, and a CD-Rom with the Camedia photo software.

You will need to immediately purchase a larger SmartMedia card; I would suggest at least 64 megabytes and preferably the largest at 128 megabytes.

<b>Well how does it work?</b>

The use of the camera is straightforward and quite easy.  If you just want to pull it out of the box, pop the batteries in and start taking photos, you can do that, the camera is that easy to use.  With its default settings, the camera takes care of everything (exposure, focus, etc.) and all you have to do is push the button.

However, even though I am not an avid manual reader, I would suggest that if you purchase this camera, before you start to use it, you take the few minutes and read through the manual.  It&#146s not overly hard to read or follow and quickly goes through the highlights of all the functions.  If you want to modify any settings on the camera or use the manual settings, then you pretty much have to read the manual.

The C-4000 uses a menu system to navigate through the various options.  The introductory screen offers several choices, and using the thumb pad, you move up or down to chose the tab you want, then press okay to enter that sub-menu.  Same goes for the sub-menus, using the pad changes options and when you are complete, okay saves your setting and exits you out.

The navigation can take a little bit of getting used to.  Some simple functions that should be very easy, are a bit clumsy, such as the timer function.  Every other camera I have ever had, the timer was a button on the outside of the camera.  You pressed it and you had like 20 seconds to run over and get in your picture.  On the C-4000, this option is within a sub-menu that you need to navigate to &#150 then you select it, then you press the shutter release button and then you run over to get your picture taken.  It seems like an awful lot of work for something that should be fairly straightforward and easy (there was a timer-button on my old Olympus digital camera).

Depending upon your ultimate use of your camera, the different resolutions offered are quite helpful.  If you are planning on just using pictures in emails or on the web, the lowest resolution setting is optimal (you don&#146t want huge pictures that take forever to download).  If you are planning on printing out small size photographs (say 3x5 or 5x7) then the intermediate to middle resolutions are sufficient.  For enlargements (say 8x10 to 11x17) then you will either need the highest JPEG resolution or the uncompressed TIFF resolution.

However, you should be aware, and this is probably the largest limitation on the camera, that because the SmartMedia card is limited to 128 megabytes, you are severely limited in the amount of TIFF or high resolution photos you can take on one card.  In TIFF mode, a 128-megabyte card can only hold about 11 photographs.  This means that if you are planning on shooting in TIFF mode, you are going to need to carry plenty of cards with you, or you will have to have something you can download them to right away.

Prints from the camera are excellent (and probably quite dependent upon your printer &#150 I have an HP photosmart printer).  I have printed up to 8x10 and with a high-resolution image from the camera, the quality is just amazing (compared to enlargements from my old 1.3 mega-pixel Olympus).

The camera itself is fairly sturdy and stands up quite well to the rigors of heavy use.  I have had the camera for several months now and had it out hiking with me and out with me for more mundane tasks.  The body had held up well being tossed around in my pack and facing the rigors of the woods.  I haven&#146t had any problems with it.  However, nowhere does it say the camera is weatherproof or waterproof, so I would be very careful about getting this camera wet.  

<b>The Bottom Line on the C-4000</b>

Looking for a 4 mega-pixel digital camera that won&#146t bust your budget and is an excellent deal in the process?  The Olympus C-4000 has excellent optics, resolutions, quality and more.  The only drawback to the C-4000?  The C-4000 is limited in image capacity by the somewhat outdated &#147SmartMedia&#148 memory card.  However, if you either don&#146t need to shoot uncompressed TIFF&#146s, or are willing to have a handful of memory cards with you, I don&#146t think that you could go wrong with the C-4000.  I am very happy with it (I&#146m the one with the handful of memory cards) for both prints and for web photos.  It will be several more years before the little bug comes back and says, &#147Jeff, you need to get a new camera.&#148
