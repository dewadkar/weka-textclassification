            My mother bought a 1999 Chevy Lumina LS in January 1999.  She bought it spur-of-the-moment after having trouble with her 1987 Dodge Aries K car. Her Aries broke down in the dead of winter so she went to the local Chevrolet dealer and fell in love.  This car has come a long way. It is more sleek and stylish  than it started our years ago.  It has a lot of pickup, too with a V6 engine.  The amount of room in the trunk is incredible.  This has always been a big factor in my mother's car buying decisions.  She has never had a problem getting anything in it. 

Mind you, my mother is single, but this is a great family car. It is roomy, comfortable and well-designed.  All of the instruments are laid out in a way that makes sense.  It has a great feel and handles well from my personal experience in driving it.

My mother's only complaint is that she remembers when cars were really big back in the '70's, much bigger and longer that her Lumina and today's cars yet she says she could better make a U-turn in a 1973 Cadillac Coupe deVille with greater ease than she can in her 1999 Lumina.  She says today's cars don't cut the wheel like they did in the good old days. Still, we both love her Lumina! <br><br>
