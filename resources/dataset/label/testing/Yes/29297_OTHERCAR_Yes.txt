            This is the sport car you want to be in.  For the 2000 model you could choose from a newly styled cloth interior or the optional leather seating surfaces.  But standard in every camaro is air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, center console dual front and rear cup holders, and even cd and cassette storage. If you buy the Z28 or the SS camaro you get the monsoon included with the car which is awesome trust me it pushes out about 500 watts of peak power with it's eight speakers and a bunch of other awesome options but we are talking about the regular camaro right now which is still not a bad car,  the only differences between the V6 camaro and the SS V8 camaro is the SS has bigger tires, dual exhaust, bigger engine, ram air and a price difference of about $13,000.00.  One good thing that all the camaro's come with is the "Safety- Cage Construction" which is a high strength body structure with steel side door beams that provide structural integerity.
     My final words are if your buying the camaro for the power this V6 camaro is not the one for you but for the looks,  hey I would buy it if I just wanted it for looks because it is a very sharp car
