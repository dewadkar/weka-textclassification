            This is the second Cavalier I've owned and I have to say that they're wonderful cars.  I would still be driving mt first Cavalier if it hadn't been wrecked by another stupid driver making an illegal turn-you can rad about my adventures in insuranceland in my review of CGU... but I digress...A week after the accident, my fiancee and I went out to buy another car.  We looked around for most of the day and on the way home we stopped at a Chevy dealership where my fiancee immediately fell in love with the brown (she calls it 'champagne') Cavalier that became our next car.  As soon as I took it for a test drive, I knew I was in love... The seats are soft and comfortable, even for me and I'm 6'.  It has Power mirrors, a CD Player, power windows and doorlocks, dual airbags and a passive cut-off switch...  The steering is nice and tight, the anti-lock brakes have great stopping power...  Also, we got one of those cool little keychains that can unlock the door and trunk for you.  The car gets wonderful gas milage which saves us money as gas steadily climbs toward the $2 mark...  In short, this is a safe, reliable car thats fun to drive and great to own.<br><br>
