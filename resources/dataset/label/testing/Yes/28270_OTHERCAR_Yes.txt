            My wife freqeuntly changes vehicles due to her boredom with one.  We average leasing one vehicle for only about a year before aquiring another.  Recently when shopping for her new vehicle she developed a liking to the Dodge Durango.  Her motivation for liking the car was mainly based on its appearance.  She absolutly feel in love with the body style.  The main characteristic about the car that I was not fond of was the low gas milage and the frequent fill ups needed.  The pickup is not too bad considering that it is a SUV, and the Durango is avery roomy and from what I've heard is a very reliable car. My wife thinks that we might keep this one for longer than average.<br><br>
