            My father had been arguing with me for about 4 months saying that he was going to get a new car. The next day he came home with a nice new Honda Accord. 5 speed manual. I would have to agree on his purchase. The 1999 Accrod's have a nice look to them, along with a good factory sound system. The manual makes it all the more better. People want to get the 6 cylinder with this car when if you look at specs of both engines, The 6 wins...barely. If you want about 5 more miles in top speed and you want less gas milage, then get the 6. The 4 cylinder is a much better choice. But, now-a-days people want bigger and better. Well, in this case bigger is not always better. 
   Now handling on this car is a dream. Easy to turn, easy to shift gears. The moonroof adds a nice touch to it. For nice summer days it's great. 
   If you're looking to buy a new car, take a look at the Honda Accord.
