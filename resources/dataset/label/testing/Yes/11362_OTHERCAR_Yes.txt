            I have owned a car since I was 16 years old.  However, now I am a mother of two very active children and we travel very often.  We decided to look at Sport Utility Vehicle's and minivans to have more room and cargo space.  

After test driving many different and popular styles of Sport Utility Vehicles, we decided the Dodge Grand Caravan was the best vehicle for our needs.  I absolutely love our van, it has tons of room and plenty of space for all of our baggage no matter where we go.  I am able to fit 7 people, 6 very comfortably, and plenty of cargo, double stroller, etc. in the back with room to spare.  

The ride compared to the Sport Utility Vehicles is tremendous... it is just like driving a car and very comfortable.  The ride is wonderful and we love to go on vacations in the van.  Another added plus is the option of bucket seats in the middle, which my kids love so they can be independent and recline when they are sleeping, and when adults get in they are not on top of each other.  

The double sided slide doors are a wonderful feature and in my opinion a must have with kids.  The seats are a little heavy but easily removable and make it even better and more manageable.  The drive is smooth and relaxing.  A little louder than a car, but a lot bigger too. We also got the All Wheel Drive, which we absolutely love in the rain and snow.  

This vehicle is wonderful for families, big and small.  I have seen a lot of older couples with them as well, and if you take a lot of people with you a lot, what a deal.  I recommend this van to anyone and everyone looking and know it is rated one of the best for reliability, etc.<br><br>
