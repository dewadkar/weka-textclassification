            I have loved Fuji cameras since I bought my first Fuji digital camera. My last one had a little accident via one of my children and was out of warranty so I really wanted to upgrade instead of repairing. Fuji was my first choice of brands. I read reviews, looked for details on cameras that fit my needs. This one fit everything. The optical zoom is just enough for me taking close-ups of my kids. Plus it offers 5 different flash modes. Including the ever popular red-eye reduction! 
I just love that it also allows for video. It does not have sound which is a down side but it's still wonderful to be able to grab video of the kids being silly and if we're lucky we'll catch our last "baby" learning to walk! 
The new XD card this camera uses transfers quicker than the old cards. 
The two downsides of the camera as mentioned are batteries, which most digital camera users know no camera is without this problem so get some rechargeable batteries. The other problem is the time it takes for the camera to be ready again after snapping a shot. It takes sometimes up to 7 or 8 seconds for the camera to recover which can mean you might miss a cute shot in between. That however is just a small issue to deal with, with an overall wonderful camera. I purchased mine on sale and not only did I get the 16mb card that came with it but I also received a free 32mb card with it. This made the deal even better. So my listed price included a 4yr warranty(purchased separately) the camera and a 16 & 32mb card.
