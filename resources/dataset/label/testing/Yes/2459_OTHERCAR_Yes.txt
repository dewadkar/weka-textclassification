            I purchased this vehicle for myself to do grocery shopping, run errands and transport my three dogs around.  I just love it.  It has room for my three dogs and still comfortably seats 4 adults.  I use it for yard sales on Sat. and even managed to get a porch swing inside and still had room for 3 adults and a bunch of small items I had purchased that same day too!

The price I paid for this vehicle was also amazing. $14,600 with only 24,000 miles on it.  It still has that new car smell even.  It has a good stereo, great storage for cups, sunglasses, cassette tapes and the cruise control is on the steering wheel.

I also love the ride.  I live in the country and my driveway is gravel.  This vehicle is great for gravel and dirt roads.  You don't even realize you are on gravel.  It also takes dips and bumps well, too!

I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone who runs around town a lot.  I love to garden and I can throw bags of soil, flowers and even small sheets of plywood in this car/truck.  It can even tow my travel trailer.  The 6 cylinder engine will tow my Prowler 23 ft, 4500 lb. trailer.  It's Great!

I can't say enough about this vehicle.  It's worth the price I paid and then some.  <br><br>
