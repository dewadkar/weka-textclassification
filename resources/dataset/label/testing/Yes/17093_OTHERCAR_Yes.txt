            I have driven Mercedes products for as long as I can remember.  Never ever have I been unsatisfied...until now.  I am not really sure where Mercedes is going with the ML430.  Its a good looking truck, powerful, and fairly comfortable, but this vehicle lacks the quality that makes a Mercedes special.  In 9000 miles I have squeaks and rattles, and just by looking at the fit and finish you can tell that something is not up to standard.  The black paint will swirl before you drive it off the lot, and again, it just lacks the quality one would associate with a Mercedes.  It just doesn't feels solid like a German car should.  On the bright side, I think the truck is one of the best looking sport utilities out there, and it drives like a car.  But for the price and what you get, I really don't think it is worth it.  <br><br>
