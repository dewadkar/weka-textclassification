            I have owned one that was bought for the purpose of having enough storage and seating capacity to carry my dogs, kids and their friends. I would buy another in a heart beat because it is the best on the market.  The first to have front-wheel drive.  Just as spacious as other minivans, but drives like a car.  I love the comfort of the seats, and how much storage it has. It is the 90's version of a station wagon, with special attention to the front wheel drive.  It is easy to drive in all types of conditions, and safer too.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for seating capacity and storage, but doesn't want to spend the high price of an Sport Utility Vehicle.
