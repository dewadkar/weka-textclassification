            The Sony Mavica MVC-FD88 is SIMPLY the best and easiest digital camera on the market. The SIMPLE fact that it uses a floppy disc as it's &quot;film&quot; allows for SIMPLE transfer to you computers hard drive and any photo is minutes from family and friends no matter where they live around the world. Other digital cameras offer an internal memory which need to be downloaded to your hard drive. Often times this means that if you are out on a trip, once the cameras memory is used up, you are out of luck. Floppy discs are a SIMPLE media. They are light,easy to carry and best of all, pop them in your disc drive and your photo is a click away. You could literally take a photo of the family around the Christmas tree and send it to grandma in her e mail in less than 5 minutes. Not only does this camera deliver an outstanding photo, but you can also creates mpeg images as well which play easily on your windows media player. These are also great to e mail to friends and family. One small downfall to the camera is really is best trait. It uses a 1.5 megabyte disc. The disc can hold as many as 20 photos, or as few as 3, depending on the resolution you choose. But take 10 floppy disc's on a trip and you have plenty of memory. Didn't like the picture you just took? Eyes closed? NO Problem! Delete that one and take it again! How many times have you spent 8 to 10 dollars to develop film, and days, weeks later found out that the great shot you got was not so great, out of focus or just not there. With this camera you know just how the shot came out seconds after you trip the shutter. One great feature also not to be overlooked is it's audio/ video outputs. This allows for easy viewing on your television! Yes, your Television! This camera SIMPLY has it all! And since you can use the disc's over again and there are no developing charges. It pays for itself over and over again.<br><br>
