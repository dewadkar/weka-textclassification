            This is my second car and I like it a lot.  I owned a 200sx before this car and this one is much nicer, looking wise and performance wise.  I admit it is not even close to as fast as the 300zx but with a moderate 140-145 horsepower it can still take all the higher priced civics you see around everywhere.  I have had the car for about 3 months and I have had to put around $1000 into it but I knew when I bought it, it had some problems so I'm not trying to say it's an unreliable car because it isn't.  In fact most of my repairs were fairly minor.  The most expensive thing to replace were my fuel injectors because I had to replace all four.  My 240sx has around 139k miles which is fairly decent for the year and the engine still runs good as well as the transmission.  The gas mileage on this car is good especially for how old it is.  It supposed to get 20 city and 27 highway but mine gets closer to 18-19 city and 21-22 highway.  Of course these numbers are for the manual version which gets slightly more miles per gallon but only on the freeway.  I personally think this car handles very well compared most cars in its class.  You can easily make a right hand turn in 3rd gear.  One down point of this car though is that its hard to do stuff to it, mainly because of how old it is.  For instance you cant get cold-air intake for this year because there is no where to put it and for regular intake it's a hassle put it in cause of all the extra sensors it has for the filter.  Other than these minor problems the car is great car to drive and own.


If you are looking for a good car for a little amount of money than this is the car for you.
