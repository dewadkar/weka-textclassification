            I had this extra cash burning a hole in my pocket, and I REALLY wanted to get a digital camera.  My budget was about $300 and I wanted to find an all-around good camera with a good resolution--I wanted the max resolution to be no less than 1 megapixel.  I was also looking for a camera with an LCD screen so I could show it off to my friends.  I love gadgets, what can I say?

I own an HP printer and my dad has an HP desktop computer, both of which work great, so I knew I could trust this camera.  I bought it through a web site that was offering 25% off all electronics (theglobe.com), so I paid $225 for camera, which was originally price at $299.

Overall I think the camera is great.  The pictures, even on the medium resolution, are clear.  It feels like I am taking pictures with a standard 35mm camera, except I don't hear film winding after each picture.  The battery life on the camera is good.  With occasional use, I didn't have to change the batteries until after using it for 4 months.  It comes with a wrist strap and some good software including Adobe PhotoDeluxe Business Edition, and ULead Photo Explorer 4.2.  It includes 8MB of flash memory which holds 40 medium resolution pictures, and changing the flash card is a snap.  I do think that additional cards are a bit pricey though.  And of course the screen is great--you can use the menu on the screen to delete pictures, and change the zoom.  There is a 2x zoom that can only be used through the screen.  I've only used it once and it was a bit awkward trying to frame the picture through the screen, but it worked.  The camera comes with a video cord so it can be hooked up to a TV to show the pictures that are in the camera's memory.  I tried it a couple of times and it comes out nice--except that any vertical shots you take come out sideways on the TV screen.

There are some small details about the camera that I wish I could change.  Firstly, the camera does not come with an AC adapter.  You can order one through HP, but it's around $50.  I bought some rechargeable alkaline batteries and they do the job fine.  I didn't find the need to buy the adapter.  Also, the camera comes with a serial PC cord, not USB.  So it takes a few minutes to download just a few pictures to the computer.  Overall not a huge deal, but having at least the USB option would have been nice.  The biggest gripe I have about the camera is that the flash is poor.  When used indoors, the flash does not reach very far and the brightness is not consistent throughout the photograph.  For example, I will have taken a picture of a friend indoors, and one half of the picture is brighter than the other.  Using the software helps brighten photos nicely, but the flash needs to be brighter and stronger.<br><br>
