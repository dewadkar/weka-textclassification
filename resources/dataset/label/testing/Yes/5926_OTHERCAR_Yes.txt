            My Jeep Cherokee is a sturdy 4 wheel drive sport utility vehicle.  Icy hills are not a problem with this vehicle.  My Jeep gives my the option of putting it in full time four wheel drive or part time...all without getting out of the comfort of my leather seat.  It's roomy too.  Five of us and the dog fit into this vehicle.  The back seat will fold down to give us more room should we need it.  Even our 1991 with over 140,000 miles on it is great!!  It was worth every dime we paid for it.  We did have a recall on the brakes, but that is taken care of.  The maintenance, change of oil &amp; oil filter are kept up on a regular maintenance schedule.  It has cruise control, electric windows, child locks, electric locks, am/fm stereo cassette, power steering and power brakes. Our Jeep is a lovely shade of red.  No mini van for us, we love our Jeep.<br><br>
