            Let me start by saying this is a pretty decent vehicle let down by a couple of areas. Would I still consider if in the market again - yes...but well worth knowing some 'living with it facts' !
I bought the car used with 20k miles. Price was good. 

My wife wanted a 7 seater so that on school runs she could pick up a couple of extra kids for a play date (for our children). True to form my wife ruled out any form of Van on the basis that it was for nerds (she's not a redneck -just astute). The brief was simple: 7 seats, decent engine, all wheel drive capability. This meant we looked at:

Land Rover Discover: Excellent, the best all-wheel drive car there is, great 3rd seat concept..but a bit too expensive.
Toyota/Lexus: Give me a break - world's best marketing con
Audi/Volvo: maybe - was not convinced
Mercedes M Class: stupid 3rd seat engineering - overpriced
Mitsubishi: nah...

Now, I had set my sights on a 5.9l V8 Shelby version being sold by Dee Schneider (lead singer of Twisted Sister) but was told something like 'If you think I am turning up at school in a bright metallic blue Dodge with a huge strip down the middle then think again!' She just didn't get it - this car had a DVD player and a Playstation!!!!

Anyway, what we got was an SLT package with leather, wood trim, fantastic stereo system, running bars, fog lights - a really nice specification for $21,500. On the whole we are pretty happy with it..so here's the low down:

Exterior Styling
Very beefy looking - good all American rugged looks, a car with attitude - in a sea of SUV mediocrity this car stands out. It may not have subtle styling like the BMW but along with the Discovery it certainly makes a statement.
Engine/Transmission
The engine struggles from a standstill but once up to around 40-50mph is well balanced and with good response. It sounds a bit agricultural unless you rev hard...but then there goes an oil well....fuel economy is something you have to forget about.
Suspension/Ride & Handling
Ride is good. Handling is...OK this is an SUV, do not try to drive like a car. the leaf spring rear suspension just does not like it and the back will swing out. We also have a Grand Cherokee. The Grand C can be thrown around corners, don't try with the Dodge. Anyway - who the heck uses lef springs int he 21st century?
Interior Styling
Leather seats are comfortable and supportive and general interior design is fine with reasonably good ergonomics. Apart from the leather though, the choice of plastics for trim items is downright stooopid. In comparison to the Grand Cherokee (made by the same company) the trim is just too cheap and nasty. For a little extra cost the whole area around the instrument cowl and dash could have been improved dramatically. It is the one thing I find really annoying - it sounds tinny and I don't even like touching it..yeuch!
Sound System
OK - who needs to touch anything. The sound is fantastic. Infinity premium sound system is fabulous.
Third Seat
Very good - I would rather it had a locking mechanism to anchor the seat squab but overall it is pretty good - does not leave a whole lot of room for luggage once its done but am reasonably happy with that part- anyway, there's a roof rack.

All in all - great car. I would certainly look at again if I was in the market but would probably go for the bigger engine (once you are at 14 mpg does it really matter going to 12mpg?). Would certainly go for the DVD/TV/Playstation deal for my kids (and me) - so I guess I should have bought the Dee Schneider car.

The only two others I would consider at this stage are the Discovery and (because I have admired my colleague's) the new Ford Explorer.
