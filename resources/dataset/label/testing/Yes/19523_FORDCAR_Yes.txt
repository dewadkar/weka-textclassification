            Ever since the 1960's, Ford has produced the icon of the American made sports car.  The Ford Mustang has been the benchmark for American speed at an affordable price in the last couple decades.  One great thing about the Mustang is the fact that it changes with the times.  The 2001 which sports the new style which debuted in 1999 has some minor changes to help this great automobile continue its success in the new millenium.


<b>The style</b>

Ever since 1999, Ford did major upgrades to the Ford Mustang.  Not only did they increase the stock horsepower to 190 on the V6 and 260 for the GT, but they completely redesigned the body style to a beautiful looking sports car.  The 2001 Mustang has a few minor adjustments to the exterior of the car.  First, the hood has an increased opening (actually an opening as opposed to the plastic covering on the 99's and 2000's).  The raised hood scoop gives a new mean look to the hood although it does not add to the performance as a ram air would.  Second, the head lights are given a nice tint which definitely adds to the overall look of the car.  Third, the side scoops were made slightly bigger.  I personally like the side scoops how they were, but the side scoops on the 2001, by no means, look bad at all.  Also, many people were upset that the 2000 Mustang was unavailable in the ever popular yellow exterior color.  Well, Ford decided to bring back the beautiful yellow for the 2001.  The 2001 Mustang is definitely an eye catching vehicle.


<b>The different variations of the 2001 'stang</b>

<i>Each of the 4 models discussed below, which are available for 2001, include the above styling changes which I described.</i>

<b><i>The V6 Coupe</i></b>
This is the most basic model of the 2001 Mustang.  Coming with a hardtop, and a 3.8 liter engine, this Mustang is definitely a great deal for the money.  This car, which comes in automatic or 5 speed manual, ranges anywhere from $15,500 to $18,000 depending on the options.

<b><i>The V6 Convertible</i></b>
Imagine driving down the road in your brand new 2001 Mustang topless!  No, I don't mean without your shirt on.  I mean with the roof retracted, the wind blowing on your face, and the sun shining on your body.  What an experience.  As an owner of a 2000 V6 Convertible, I can vouch for the thrill of driving this car.  This vehicle comes with the 3.8 liter engine and ranges from $19,000 to $22,000.

<b><i>The 2001 GT</i></b>
The monster V8 is back in the 2001 GT.  The major differences between the GT and the V6 Mustang is the dual exhaust, bigger engine, and ultimately more horsepower.  260 horsepower to be exact.  Not a bad engine working under your hood.  This car can go 0-60MPH in about 5.7 seconds.  Pretty darn fast.  The GT has optional 17&quot; wheels which look fantastic.  The 2001 17&quot; wheels are different than the ones on the Mustang GT's released the previous two years.  This car ranges from $21,000 to $24,000.

<b><i>The GT Convertible</i></b>
The highest model in the line of 2001 Mustangs, the V8 convertible is my personal favorite.  Packing power with style, you cannot go wrong with this sexy automobile.  With the same features and options as the GT Coupe in addition to the convertible top, this car ranges from $23,000 to $26,000.


<b>Options I recommend if you get a 2001 Mustang</b>

I strongly recommend getting the stock GT 17&quot; wheels if you get the GT and, if possible, the V6.  These wheels add to the handling and overall appearance of the car.  In the stereo department, the Mach 460 system is a definite must.  This system makes such a difference, it is definitely worth the extra few hundred bucks.  Also, if you can deal with it, go with the 5-speed manual; getting an automatic just wouldn't fit in with this sports car, especially if you get the GT!
