            I bought this car brand new in 1994. It is the best car I ever bought. I bought this car because at the time I needed a cheap reliable vehicle. The car now has over 200,000 miles and runs like the first day I bought it.
I love everything about this car. It has never treated me wrong. I get in she starts and always gets me where I want to go.Even on cold New England mornings she starts on the first try.
The stereo cranks. For a cheap car they put much thought into the stereo system. It even has a anti theft device on it. 
Driving this vehicle is a love relationship all the way. You can't beat the reliability of it. I recommend this car for the young and old alike.
Anyone who wants a cheap reliable vehicle should buy a Hyundai. Teens will love it as it is easy to handle and inexpensive to buy for their first car.
I have only done general maintenance on my Hyundai. Such as oil changes,changing fluid and belts etc... Well worth the money and the best car you'll ever own
Buy a Hyundai you can't go wrong!!!
