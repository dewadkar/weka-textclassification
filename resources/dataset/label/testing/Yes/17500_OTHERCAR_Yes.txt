            I drove a Honda Accord after the birth of our first child.  It was a great car for a while.  But it just didn't have enough room.  If you wanted to take another couple with you somewhere they had to squeeze into the back seat. Or they would have to take their own car. And just forget grocery shopping with a stroller in the trunk.  So after a lot of thought we decided to check out mini-vans. Since we used to be the people of said no way to a having a van this was a hard choice.  So when  we came across the Plymouth Voyager we just loved it.  

We now have to small children in car seats and there's plenty of room.  We have since moved and have done a lot of traveling back and forth to our home state of Georgia.  The van rides great and the seats are very comfortable for long trips.  Even the back seats have great leg room.  The van has at least 10 Cup holders for those thirsty passengers.  I have two main problems with my van.  The first is that I don't have Rear A/c and it can get very stuffy sitting in the back. Second I don't have power windows.  But other than that I just love my van.<br><br>
