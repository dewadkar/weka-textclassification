            Since its introduction, the Jaguar S-Type has received mixed reviews. Some say it�s nothing more than an expensive Ford, while most praise the elegant interior, luxurious ride and heritage inspired exterior design. Perhaps both criticisms are well founded, but S-Type has evolved into a car that offers real world variety and a true Jaguar experience on the road. 

The 2002 S-Type suffered from a few minor problems. Firstly, an automatic transmission that shifted clumsily and seemed easy to confuse � unacceptable on a $40,000+ automobile. Second, the S-Type had a very Ford-looking interior. To quote myself: �Frankly it all looks as if it came straight out of a Ford Taurus.� And that was a true statement at the time; the interior of the �02 S-Type was just too bland for a Jaguar. Third, the interior lacked adequate storage space for little things like sunglasses and wallet.

These days of increasing competition in the luxury car market, Jaguar is listening to its customers and, in some cases, the motoring press as well. Jaguar has addressed each of these problems and made improvements in many other areas as well.

 The 2003 S-Type has a better- looking, and user-friendly interior; it looks more like a Jag. The boring center stack is gone and gauges have a sportier flair, although still lack the classy backlit feature found on other cars in this price range. For �03 the center console storage area/armrest is much larger and can easily accommodate such items as; cell phone, change purse, wallet etc. Also, the V8 has grown to 4.2-liters making an impressive 293 hp (up from last year�s 281). V8 models now sport a ZF, 6-speed automatic which is a HUGE improvement over the old 5-speed automatic transmission. The new S-Type is stiffer and benefits from adjustable pedals as well.

Of course the big news for 2003 is the addition of and �R� model to the S-Type lineup. Jaguar cars with the R designation are performance models � similar to BMW�s M-series cars or Mercedes� AMG cars
. 
Stylistically, the S-Type R stands out in a crowd with beautiful 18-inch wheels, wire mesh grille and dramatic monochromatic paint. The R also has a sportier front fascia with fog lamps built in, rear spoiler and fabulous �R� badging on the rear deck lid and both front fenders. The R looks like a regular S-Type on steroids. Like a cat preparing to leap on its prey, the R has a muscular and menacing appearance that turns heads.

However, the 2003 Jaguar S-Type R is much more than a family sedan with fancy wheels and blacked out trim. The S-Type R is nothing less than a fire-breathing, ground-pounding, GS430-stomping, tire-smoking sport sedan fueled by a supercharged V8 cranking out 390 hp, all wrapped in a sleek package that is unmistakably Jaguar. You could spend $20,000 more on an AMG E55, but why?

For all practical purposes, the S-Type R isn�t even a luxury sedan at all. Unlike the compromising Lexus GS430, the S-Type R goes for the throat is what can only be called an all-out performance sedan. Similar to the BMW 540i in execution but with a less stern result, the S-Type R is able to dispense this pavement scorching performance in a rather effortless manner. The R can reach 60 mph from a dead stop in just over 5 seconds, but the car never loses its composure. The V8 configuration of this car gives it adequate torque off the line, while the supercharger delivers rocket like acceleration at higher RPMs. Stab the gas at 3500 RPM, the supercharger whines aggressively, and the R leaps forward with all the verve and authority of a jet-fighter at take-off. The 6-speed automatic works well with this engine, never �hunting� or hesitating when the accelerator is stomped upon. Under hard acceleration, up-shifts are firm and precise. Downshifts are somewhat noticeable, but never annoying. The driver can select a sport mode which delays up-shifting in order maximize power.

Another improvement with regard to the transmission has to do with the �J-gate� configuration of the shift lever. While Jaguar has retained this unique feature, the action required to move the lever from �D� to reverse or park seems less of a hassle.

Ride and handling are more sport than luxury. Low profile P275/35R18 tires don�t offer much in the way of soaking up potholes, but boy do they bite. Never harsh, the S-Type R has a firmness that belies a luxury car. Again, this is similar in execution to a car like the BMW 540 but differs from other luxury/sport sedans such as the GS430 that never completely commit to either luxury or sport. While a car like the GS430 is able to tackle twisty back roads, the S-Type devours them and is more suited to this type of chore. There is little body roll, and the result is a feeling of enhanced control. The R has a light and �tossable� feel that is lacking in other luxury/sport sedans.

Inside the S-Type R is a reasonably spacious cabin with plenty of room up front but less than roomy accommodations in the rear. The S-type in any trim can haul 5 adults, but 4 adults is a better fit if comfort is a concern.  R seats are sporty without being hard and uncomfortable. Improved thigh support keeps driver in place during spirited driving. Legroom is plentiful for front seat occupants, but only average for the rear passengers. Headroom and shoulder room are all more than adequate with not one passenger complaint during a week of business lunches and trips to the local shopping mall. Leather is soft and at the same time sporty. Dark wood trim adorns the R, but neither adds to or detracts from a cabin that is very attractive overall. Trunk space is average. The S-Type�s trunk is deep but rather narrow � creative packing is key to maximizing cargo space.

Overall, the 2003 S-Type is a significant improvement over last year�s model; what small irritation there were, have been eliminated. The R version of the S-Type is not cheap, at just over $60,000 there are plenty of competent choices but the S-Type R holds it own against the competition. In the high dollar world of luxury/performance sedans, the S-Type often costs thousands less than the competition. An all-out performance sedan, the S-Type R is unmatched in terms of handling, straight-line acceleration and stunning good looks. The S-Type R doesn�t have to be everything to everyone and it doesn�t try - with V6, V8 and supercharged R styles to choose from, the S-Type has something to offer every preference and pocketbook. The S-type R offers aggressive stand out styling and the pure brawn to back it up.
