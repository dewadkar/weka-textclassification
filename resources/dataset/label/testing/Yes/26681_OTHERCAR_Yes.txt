            This is a good vehicle for the following reasons.  It rides like a sedan, comfortable, smooth and responsive.  My wife says she feels safe when she drives it, we live in the mountainous area of northeastern Oregon.  It is actually one of the best rigs we have ever owned.  The only drawbacks to it are that it has to use Premium gas and the nearest dealership for the scheduled maintenance (which is expensive) is 150 miles away.  If you live in an area which needs a four-wheel drive vehicle I would highly recommend this SUV, but it would be expensive overkill to own it in an urban environment (Unless you don't mind paying for the prestige of owning one.)<br><br>
