            I am not a mechanic nor am I versed in the technical language of automobiles. I am a stay at home Mom with 2 kids and I drive the living daylights out of my car. 

I have had my current car which is the Saturn since 1992. It just turned 8 years old and I am planning on making it last at least another 2. I thought I would write this review for those of you who want a perspective from someone who has a lot of personal experience with this vehicle but is totally ignorant about it from the technical side!  Before reading mine I would suggest the one before it written by someone with a great deal of knowledge about what's under the hood. When you're done with that come back for mine!

I was graduating from college wen I received this car used as a hand me down from my brother. Even at 2 years old it was the newest car I had ever owned.  My brother had hardly driven it at all since he had a company car so I will say that even at 2 years old it was in hardly used condition. However from that point on everything changed...

I drove this car a lot back and forth from North Carolina to Virginia and put double the amount of miles on it in a year that they recommend. I never had a single problem with it in the first 3 years that I owned it. I took it in for its regular checkups but beyond that I never heard a peep.  I absolutely loved dealing with the Saturn people. Whenever I took my car in they treated me like spun gold.  In fact they would sprinkle rose petals in my car and leave mints on the seat when they were done. I know this is definately going overboard on pleasing your customers but I still thought it was pretty cool! (Sure it has nothing to do with the actual car..but thought it was worth mentioning!)

I was already putting tons of miles on my car every year traveling home quite often but when I married my husband that increased. He is in the military and since marrying him we have lived in North Carolina, Florida and New Mexico.

 This car has been driven all over the United States. We regularly drove it back and forth from Florida to North Carolina and Virginia to visit family. We took it to Orlando, Key West, Miami and lots of other places while sightseeing in Florida. 

Not only did we never have a problem with this car but it got incredible gas mileage. I can drive obscene distances in this car on one tank of gas. I have yet to ever put more than 11 dollars in the tank at one time.  My husband's Jeep is a gas guzzler and we spend triple on his gas every month for what it costs to gas up the Saturn.

Now there were a few things we had replaced after the warranty ran out that Saturn told me needed to be done. I can't tell you what they were but I did what they told me to do. I think the most I spent on that was 100 dollars.  I made sure to always do everything they told me to do when they told me to do them and I am going to assume that is a big reason why I have had few problems with the car. 

Now after having had the car for about 6 years one day it did break down on me. Something broke in the top part of my engine which apparently messed up the whole top part of my engine and I had to have it replaced. They said it would cost me 2000 dollars. 

This was the worst thing to ever happen to me with this car. Now before this I always drove used cars and whenever they hit this age they regularly had problems and I easily spent 1000 dollars more than once having them repaired. 

I was really upset though about this incident with the Saturn because this happened within 2 weeks of the car being in for a checkup. I talked with the manager who cut the price in half. It was still a big chunk to pay and I did not appreciate it but it still was the first problem I had had with the car in 6 1/2 years and so I decided to just accept it and move on!

After this I never again have had any problems with this car. I would imagine not since half of the engine is brand new! We drove the car from Florida to New Mexico which was a very long drive and it did beautifully.

 Now that I am living in New Mexico I will say that the car has a problem going up very steep mountains. Everywhere I drive is mountainous so by this I mean an entirely huge mountain. The only time this has happened is when we drove up to Cloudcroft which is a mountain resort. On the way back down a few lights came on and it seemed the car was overheating. We let it rest for 30 minutes and all was well after that. I took it in and they could find nothing wrong with it except that they said the car was not really made for that sort of driving.

I do not have 4 wheel drive on this car so it climbs the mountain fairly slowly but I'll have to say it keeps up pretty well!  I have been more than happy with it. I was really afraid we would be forced to get something new with the terrain out here but I have been pleasantly surprised. Where we live now is an hour away from anything so I regularly drive my car long distances. We have been out here a year and it still performs as great as ever.

One complaint I have about this car is that for some reason unbeknownst to me it goes through oil way too fast. It has always done this. I have to constantly put oil in my car.  I have talked with other Saturn owners who say the same thing. I don't know if this is something they improved with the newer Saturns or not. It is annoying but not enough so for it to sway my opinion on the Saturn. 

The second complaint I would have about this car is that from what I understand they designed the engine very differently from other cars. It would appear that Saturn put a lot of things in different places and made this car in such a way that if you are not a Saturn mechanic you will have a difficult time working on it.

 The only reason I say this is because after the warranty ran out I tried taking my car to other places other than a Saturn dealer.  While I was visiting my Mom in Virginia I decided to have the car checked up before I headed back. I took it to her mechanic and this was by no means a small establishment.

 I did not take it there because it was any cheaper just because it was the easiest and closest. They had a terrible time with it and told me that they always have problems working on Saturns because they did not make it easy for other people to work on them. This is not the only time I was told this. 

Once I had to have something replaced and according to the mechanic it should have been very easy but Saturn stuck it in a place where you had to take all these other things apart to get to it and it took him awhile to figure that out. I have heard this from other people as well who have Saturns. 

The solution....always take it to the Saturn dealer. I don't know if this is really a complaint because I rarely have to put my car in and if I do it is voluntarily just to have its checkup. If they did this on purpose to guarantee their customers would go back to the dealer then they accomplished their task. It doesn't bother me though because I like the star treatment they give their customers! 

My car now has almost 200,000 miles on it and it has been worth every penny I paid for it and more. This was a very inexpensive car when it was bought back in 1992 and when I took it on in 94 my car payments were only 130 a month. That is how inexpensive this car was for me. I saved insurmountable amounts of money with the gas mileage which to me is one of the greatest things about this car. It drives better than any car I have ever owned and I have always felt very safe.  

I plan on making this car last until the end of our time here in New Mexico which would be 2 years. Then it will be 10 years old and we will just see where it is at that point!  

Since the car has now been paid off for quite some time I fully enjoy driving around a paid for vehicle which never gives me an added expense. Usually used cars come without the car payment but they still give you some unforeseen expense every month when they have their various problems. Not this one!! 

The only money I have put in to it was the 1000 back when it broke down 3 years ago and maybe another 100 or so on parts I replaced one year.  If you added that on to the original cost of the car it was still a great buy. I would recommend it to anyone!<br><br>
