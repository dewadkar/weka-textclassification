              I bought this car for several reasons, and I must admin, one of the large reason was the way it looked. It definitely turns heads. The other reason was it's speed.

  Before this I owned a compact economy car that did nothing but upset me. So... When I got a new job, I got a new car, and this is it. I love this car, I really do. It looks fantastic, but it doesn't stop there. The power the car puts out is enough to satisfy me. I love going fast, don't tell the cops, but it does fly. I have tested it's acceleration, close to top speeds, and cornering ability, and I have conlcluded that this car fits me perfectly. 

 The engine is reliable, and I've never had any problems with it, but there is one fatal flaw. Whenever I run over a puddle, something happens with the fan and water gets sucked up into the engine and the power steering goes out, the battery light comes on, and I have to turn the car off. This is not such a big deal in a residential area, but on the street can be dangerous. I'm not sure if this happens to everyone, but it happens to me. So if you have another car to drive in the rain you'll be a lot safer. I have to keep a special look out for puddles. 

  So besides the problem it has with puddles becase it is low to the ground, the visibility is fine, the power output is outstanding, the look is dynamic as you can see, and it rides quitely and even the stereo system is decent for factory. 

  I recommend this car if you don't have to deal with puddles on a daily basis, so if you live in anywhere but Seattle you should be ok.
