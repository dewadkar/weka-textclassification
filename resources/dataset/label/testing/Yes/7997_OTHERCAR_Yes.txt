            I love this vehicle because it is extremely durable. It allows me to either go through rough terrain or drive in style on the I-95. I find is easy to access with my 17 month old child. It has lots of room for the back passengers. I find that it needs minimal repairs. I have 148,000 miles on mine and have only done: tire rods, brakes, radiator reserve, and air conditioner. I don't think that is bad due to prolong utilization. Tell me what other car can go that long and that far and that tough terrain and need as little as repairs.  In my opinion those are not repairs, those are necessary maintenance that you would have to do on any car if you had that many miles on it.<br><br>
