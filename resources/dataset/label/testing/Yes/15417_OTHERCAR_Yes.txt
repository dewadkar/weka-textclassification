               When my teenage daughter was ready to trade her Nissan Sentra for a pickup truck, Mazda was the first place I looked.  Basically the same as a Ford Ranger but with a better warranty (3 years/50,000 miles instead of 3 years/36,000 miles), it has a good record of reliability.
   The truck is a Cab Plus 4, meaning it has four doors and a backseat with two &quot;jump&quot; seats that face each other.  I wouldn't want to sit in those seats for major traveling, but they're perfectly comfortable for an hour or less.  And when you don't need the seats, you can fold them up, creating plenty of indoor storage behind the front seats.
   I've had this truck for 15 months now and have never had a problem, never visited the dealer.  The Firestone Wilderness HT tires are not wearing well despite regular rotation and balancing, and hopefully Mazda will stop using them.  I have 19,000 miles on the truck and expect to replace all four tires within six months at the rate they're going.
   The 3.0 L six-cylinder engine is more than adequate when not hauling anything, but is underpowered once extra weight is involved.  I would buy a 4.0 L in the future.  The 3.0 DOES deliver a very decent 20 MPG combined city and highway, though.
   Interior is comfortable and all instruments are within easy reach.  Although the seats are called &quot;split bench,&quot; they feel like bucket seats with the center armrest down.  You don't want to put three adults in the front seat for more than 10 or 15 minutes; they'd be better off in the back seat.
   Sticker price was about $1000 less than a comparably equipped Ford Ranger, although they are, for all intents and purposes, the very same vehicle.  I bought mine with a $1500 rebate and still talked the Mazda dealer down about another $800.
   In summary, I am very pleased with this vehicle and would definitely buy another!<br><br>
