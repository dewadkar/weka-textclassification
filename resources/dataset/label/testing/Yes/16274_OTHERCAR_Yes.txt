            In Nov. 1999, I purchased a 1999 Toyota Corolla CE.  Since that time I have put 47,000+ miles on it and have had NO problems.  During that time the only repairs made were routine maintenance.  Oil changes, tires, etc.   Just recently the &quot;check engine&quot; light showed and it was nothing but a loose gas cap.  This vehicle gives excellent gas mileage(37-41mpg), Has enough power to move into traffic safely, and is very comfortable.  Actually, it is even fun to drive! 
  In my opinion, it is a very nice vehicle for anyone, except someone who is very tall or large.The leg room and head room are ample for someone my size(6ft).To be blunt, there is nothing I dislike about this vehicle!<br><br>
