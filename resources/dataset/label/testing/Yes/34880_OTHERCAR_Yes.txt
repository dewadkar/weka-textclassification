            We love the Honda 2000 van.  We were replacing a station wagon and needed more room with 3 kids, one a baby.  

The fold down back seat is a dream and is very easy to put up and down.  It's amazing that other vans had not used it before. When the seat is up you have a deep well behind the seat for storage.  We can do most trips by using that space and don't need a car top carrier.  

We got the loaded version with power doors, etc.  I was not that interested in the power doors but they are wonderful.  There are so many times that my hands are full and I can punch a button on my key chain and the door will open.  

The other big reason we bought the Honda over other choices was the inside storage space.  If you take out all of the seats you can lay a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood flat, one of the few vans that had that much space and the only one rated highly by consumer reports.  

We get about 15 - 17 miles per gallon in town, Lexington KY, and about 22 - 25 on the highway.  The engine is very powerful and we don't have any acceleration problems.  I use cruise control most of the time on the highway and we have traveled a number of times through the West Virginia mountains and the cruise holds solid to the speed selected.  

I don't know any details about the 2001 but based on the 2000 the Odyssey is a definite buy !!!<br><br>
