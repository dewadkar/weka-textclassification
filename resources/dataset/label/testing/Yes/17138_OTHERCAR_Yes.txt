              The Canon Powershot A40 is a great camera for people of all backgrounds.

  It's silverish accents make it very attractive, and inside lies a camera feature packed, highly unusual for its price range.
  
 Features -

  - 2.0 Megapixel camera, can take 1600x1200, 1024x768, and 640x480 at Super-fine, Fine, and Normal quality each. I bought a $60 128 MB CompactFlash card for it, and with it I can take 129 of the biggest size, highest quality pictures, or 1425 of the smallest, lowest quality pictures. 
  - Movie-mode. This camera can take clips of full motion video with audio. Length depends on available free space, but with 128 MB you can do 5 minutes...
  - 3 different modes for various users. First there is the Auto mode, which takes care of lighting, exposures, etc for you. All you do is point and shoot. then there is Program AE, where you can adjust the exposure (-2 to  2), the white balance, and the effect (such as sepia, vivid, black and white). Lastly, there is Manual mode, where you can set shutter speed, focal length, even ISO settings. Your shutter speed can range from as long as 15 seconds to 1/1500 of a second, and you can choose between ISOs of 50,100,200, or 400. The result? A digital camera that can take GREAT night shots. What's good is that if you're a novice, the Auto mode takes care of you. If you have some photography background, you can find comfort in all the manual settings.
   - Video/Audio out. You can connect this camera to a TV using a RCA port and play back your photos in an automatic slideshow.
   - This camera is adaptable for bigger lenses. Feel like having a telephoto lens? This camera can accomodate it.
   - The LCD screen is 1.5'', which is the same size as a LOT of the other comparable camera's in this range, like the Nikon Coolpix 2500. Though a 4-way nav button would have been nice, the menus are easy to go through and use.
   - Viewfinder included, so you can save battery power by turning off that LCD screen. Be warned -- if you take photos less than 1 foot away you will experience signficant parallax errors.
   - Uses CompactFlash, a cheap and versatile form of memory.

  This program connectes to the computer using a USB cable, and the software is easy to use.

   When I bought this camera, I went ahead and spent an extra $25 to get a set of 1800 mAh nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. These batteries pack a punch and will last a long longer, and be a LOT cheaper in the long run.

   Also, the supplied 8 MB card will need to be substituted by something larger if you're anywhere serious. Don't see this as necessarily bad though -- nearly every other camera you see at this price/megapixel range will come with 8 MB card. Currently, the price is 50 cents per megabyte for CompactFlash cards. 

    This is my first digital camera, and I am VERY pleased. Be sure to look at other review too. Go to www.google.com, and type in the following:  Digital Camera review  "Canon Powershot A40" . The first two links are great, in depth reviews of the camera, with more pictures.
