            When purchasing our 1999 Dodge Durango, I knew we would like our new vehicle, but we love it! We bought the Durango for my husband, because I've never liked big cars or trucks; that soon changed!

We purchased the optional third row of seats and we are glad we did. The second and third rows lay completely flat, so when you don't need them for passengers, you can use that area for cargo. 

The Durango is very easy to maneuver and rides smoothly. Power windows and doors are standard equipment.

With a V-8 engine, the Durango is a gas guzzler, but definitely worth the gas money! It picks up speed well and without the &quot;jerking&quot; I've noticed with other cars or suv's.

Lucky for me, the Durango is much easier to get my 5 month son in and out of than my 4 door compact sized car, so I get to use it all the time! No more are the days that I refused to drive anything bigger a small car. The Durango is so easy and comfortable to drive for anyone!

I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy.
