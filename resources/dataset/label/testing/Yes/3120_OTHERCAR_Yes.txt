            If you are in the market for a new car, and have been to many dealers, looking for that one exceptional value, but you just can�t make up your mind, than may I suggest going to your local Hyundai dealer and taking a really hard look at the Elantra. 

For starters the Elantra is very pleasant to look at. It�s appearance makes it look as though it cost thousands more. Mind you, the Elantra is no simple base equipped vehicle. Standard equipment includes, air conditioning, AM/FM cassette, power door locks, power windows, power mirrors and a 16 position lumbar seat, to name just a few. The vehicle is loaded with standard features that most companies charge as options.

The 4 cylinder 140 horsepower engine has more than enough power, and if you buy with a 5 speed, the vehicle becomes really fun to drive. The Elantra has room enough for 4 adults, although 3 could sit in the back, but that would be a bit tight.

Overall, I like this vehicle alot. In fact I have nothing bad to say about it. This is the best value out there, and deserves a look.

Hyundai backs it�s vehicles with the best warranty in the business. 5 years or 60,000 miles bumper to bumper and 10 years 100,000 miles on the engine and drive train.

When put together with a vehicle that looks smart and costs under $11,000 new, the package is unbeatable.<br><br>
