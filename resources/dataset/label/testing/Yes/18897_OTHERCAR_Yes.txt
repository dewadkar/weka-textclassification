            Okay, I've only had my Jeep for nine days now, but I am already in love with it.  I used to have a tiny, cramped for space, Pontiac Grand Am but this Jeep is so comfortable and roomy.  The backseat is big, and with fold down seats the trunk is giant, perfect for me because I am going to be moving to college soon.

The only draw back I've found is that, like all SUV's its a gas guzzler, and with gas priced how they are lately it makes it a little disconcerting, but otherwise its a great ride.  My best friend has an Explorer, with the same engine, and everyone agrees that my ride is much smoother.  You feel as though you are riding on air in the Jeep, while you feel every bump in the Explorer.

At high speeds the Jeep handles much better than any SUV I've ever driven, however, like all of them it has its share of shaking.  If you are looking for a nice roomy SUV, and don't want to spend the cash you would for an Explorer, go with the Jeep Grand Cherokee, they are very similar cars, but the Jeep is just that little bit more enjoyable.<br><br>
