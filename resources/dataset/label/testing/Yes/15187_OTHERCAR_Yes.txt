            My husband and I had purchased a Toyota Rav4 in February of 97.  We had our daughter in March of 1998.  The downside to the RAV was that with my daughters seat in the middle of the backseat, if she was fussing and I wanted to sit next to her, there wasn't much room(and I'm a size 6/8).  I dreamed of minivans, finally on Labor Day of this year, my husband took the RAV to the Toyota dealership unbeknownst to me and came home with my beautiful Toyota Seina..  This minivan is so quiet when you drive, you feel as if you're floating in a cloud.  My inlaws have owned  Town and Country vans for years and have said that the Siena drives much nicer and is much more quiet than their van.  It comes fully loaded, with CD and cassette player(great for listening to Sesame Street CDS or tapes over and over again) One great feature is that there are buttons on the steering wheel that allow you to control the stereo.  It makes repeating that favorite Elmo song a breeze.  There is plenty of room for strollers, groceries, golf clubs, you name it.  Plenty of cup holders, I use one for the almighty Wet Wipes!!  The seats slide right out.  We plan to take a long distance trip from Florida to Connecticut this summer. I love my Siena and wouldn't trade it for all the world(except maybe to get a newer model in a few more years!!)<br><br>
