            I bought my pearl white H-6 3.0 Subaru Outback Sedan 5 months ago.  I am completely and totally in love with this car and plan to keep it for many years.  First of all, the H-6 3.0 VDC is the "top of the line" Subaru.  The 6 cylinder engine gives you all the power you need for quick passing, hills and even off-road.  

The VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) is a new feature this year.  At first I was hesitant about spending the little extra for this feature, but now that I have it I am so glad I did.  Not sure how it works but it uses a combination of your all-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes to steer you back on course if you slide.  It really works too!  My husband was driving it at about 60 when a deer jumped out in front of him and he made a quick swerve and correction and the care kept under control.  It probably saved his life.  We also have a lot of snow and ice in the winter and I cannot tell you how it feels to feel so safe.  It's very difficult to make this car slide on the ice at all, and if you do it will straighten itself out for you.  I have 2 young children and feeling safe is important to me.  I no longer look out the window in the morning and dread driving to work in the snow.  I don't even notice it being slippery out at all.

The H-6 3.0 model also comes standard with leather and wood-grain interior which is beautiful.  The VDC also has a McIntosh stereo with 200 watt amp and 13 speakers.  Let's just say that's all I need!  

I am also enjoying my heated seats, defrosting side mirrors and windshield wipers this winter.  Another of my favorite features is the automatic climate control.  Just leave it on auto and set the temp you want and you never have to mess with the controls.  

The car is very smooth riding and quiet.  There is a little air noise from the windows I could live without though.  Trunk space is average but we also went for the cargo rack for long trips.  

So far we've had only one issue with it acting strangely.  Turned out the computer (the brain) needed reprogrammed.  All covered under warranty and is now fine.
