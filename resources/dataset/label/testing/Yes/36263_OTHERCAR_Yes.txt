            Reliability is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Toyota.

My first experience with Toyota was when I was in high school and my sister had a Toyota Corona.  I remember the color, baby blue. That little car took her everywhere. Completely reliable.

Then it was my turn to get my first NEW car and I went straight to Toyota. I remember that the young salesman that attended me was friendly and even came to my home to have me sign some papers because I had missed a couple of signatures! Now, that is service.

My first Corolla was as reliable in the snow in the winters of Maryland as well as in the heat of Florida. 

Even though it looks compact on the outside, I was amazed to see how much room there really was in that car.  I could fit so much in that car that I would amaze myself.  

The mileage was also a good one. About 30-35 mpg is what I noted. Oil efficient and never let me down.  

That was in 1995 and I was under a leasing program.  In 1998, I actually bought my second Corolla. I am currently enjoying it.  And once again, the service that I have received from the Toyota personnel has been superb!

As far as I'm concerned, I'm sticking to Toyota!

P.S. My husband owns a Chevy pick up truck and today he asked me if he could use my Toyota to go to the store in the 5&quot; of snow we just had this morning.  He said that my Toyota handled better than his truck. he he
