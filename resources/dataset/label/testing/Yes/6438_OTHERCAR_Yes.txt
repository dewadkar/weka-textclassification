            I'm not a professional, but I do love photography and I wanted to get a digital camera to have fun with without the cost of developing.  I bought this one since among the ones in it's price range it had the most impressive zoom while the pixels were basically the same.  I should have known it was too good to be true.  Upon receiving the camera I immediately put in the batteries and took a picture of my friends in the same room - and was so disappointed!!!  If you are in any conditions less than the optimal sunny day outside, the camera displays a hand waving symbol suggesting that there is a high risk of the picture being blurred. This happens due to the slow shutter speed (because it is set on ISO 100 you cannot make the film speed faster to make up for the shutter speed).  Needless to say most of the time I wanted to use the camera were either shady, or cloudy, or perfectly sunny but indoors, I was faced with three options: to use flash (which alters the colors as any camera flash does), use a tri-pod (I didn't get a tiny camera so that I can lug a huge tripod around!), or the eternally blurry pictures (and trust me, there is no holding it still!!!  The pulse in your fingers distorts the shot!).
    I do have to say that the picture quality in good light conditions is nice.  Though I found the colors a little bland for me (another pet peve) they were clear.  The camera has a nice macro function, and I was able to capture some flower petals up close.  If I were going to a party where I didn't care that I had to use flash because it's just a point and shoot situation, the camera really would be quite nice, especially sporting the "6x" on the side of the lens.  But, basically that zoom is not worth paying for... you're better off getting something with more flexibility in the same price range(unless you have extreme zoom envy that is).
    It is a great little (and cute) camera for anyone who wants to have some point and shoot fun without the price of developing.  But that's all it is - point and shoot. If you're coming from an SLR, this camera is going to hurt your insides it's so annoying.
