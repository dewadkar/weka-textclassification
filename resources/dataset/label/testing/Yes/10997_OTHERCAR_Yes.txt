            We purchased our Astro new in March 1997. Our 3 kids had outgrown our Volvo station wagon and since Volvo doesn't make a mini-van we had to go to a different manufacturer.  Not being a true fan of American made cars I was hesitant about even looking at them.  However, the mini-vans available from the foreign manufacturers were simply too small and flimsy.  That left basically the Big 3.  The Ford Windstar was nothing special.  The Chrysler products were actually very nice vehicles but simply overpriced once optioned out.  That left the Suburban and Astro.  The Suburban was actually our first choice because of it sheer size and people/cargo hauling capacity.  Optioned out though the Astro came in at $10,000 less.  My wife loved her Volvo so getting her to actually like something else would be a challenge.  Yet, once she drove it she was sold.  It's size and mass was not so large as to be over-wielding...and she could carry our kids comfortably along with the few others that always seem to tag along.  Now, 3 years later it is used to cart around our soccer playing daughters, our hockey playing son (and his gear), and a few other team members from home to school to practice to game...

It has suffered a few problems along the way though.  In the three years we've had it it has been back to the dealer for unexpected service about 8 times. Most of them were for minor adjustments to the sliding door, and wind noise.  The worst (actually, it turned out for the  best) one was when the transmission died. Normally, this would have sent me into a tail-spin.  You see, this van had a 3 year - 36,000 miles warranty.  Guess when the tranny went?  At 39,000 miles (the trans would slip between first and second gear).  The fortunate part was that GM covered it under warranty anyway replacing the unit with a new one ~ and in one day!  I have owned Mercedes', BMWs, Acuras, and Volvos over the years and have not seen this kind of customer relations from any of them once their vehicles were out of warranty.

One problem that I could not get remedied was what seemed to be a design flaw. It regarded the looseness of the suspension at the right front wheel.  This causes that tire to wear prematurely along the outside edge.  I was told that this looseness was &quot;within spec&quot;.  Apparently, this is pretty common along the entire GM truck line.  I solved this problem by replacing the outer tie rod ends with a high quality after market product for about $200.  I chalked this up as insurance against premature tire wear.

My wife being relatively small (5'0), the front seats are perfect for her.  Me, being just average (5'10 at 210 lbs ~ okay, not so average) getting in and out of the front seats is hampered a bit by the seat belt mounting point.  Once in, seat adjusted, armrests down, it a pretty decent seat for a truck-based vehicle.  It is not quite car-like comfort, but then again we didn't go shopping for a car.

All in all though this vehicle has changed at least the way I now view GM.  Would I buy another GM product?  Definitely!  Would I recommend the Astro?  I have many times over.

The bad part?  Well, considering that my wife drives it 95% of the time and 95% of her trips are less than 5 miles long, her average MPG is only about 13.  On the road trips we've taken running fully loaded, both A/C's going, travelling 80-85 mph, the MPG goes up to over 19 so I guess I really can't complain considering it's size and power.

The Astro (and the GMC Safari) has basically been unchanged for the last 3 years and the pricing has actually gone down.  You would be doing yourself a disservice by not checking this one out if in the market.

By the way, we kept the Volvo(now 13 years old with 221k miles).  I am now contemplating buying a second Astro to supplement the first.
