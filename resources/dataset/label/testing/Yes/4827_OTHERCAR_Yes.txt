            Welcome to the future, I remember as a kid watching those futuristic movies and the cars of the future are designed like the new Chrysler's are now. The Chrysler LHS which stands for &quot;Luxury High performance Sedan&quot; which was originally the &quot; New Yorker &quot;, boy I was sure glad they changed that name. It finally has become appealing to the eye not that the old style was ugly infact I had a 1996 and loved it. But the new styling opened the eyes to many people who have never heard of the LHS. I have always been into high performance cars (like muscle cars) and still I have a 1970 SS Elcamino that set's in the garage and I love it. So as I got older and wanted more luxury in a car and the LHS was very appealing because of the luxuries and the high performance V6. I wasn't to crazy about the body style in 1996 but the interior and over all setting of the luxury LHS was awsome and I enjoyed my 1996 and thought I would keep it for a long time. Then came out of the blue this new redesign of the Chrysler auto line and the new style of the LHS is just what I wanted. Know that it had everything performance luxury and looks.
It was time to trade in the 1996 LHS for the new 2000 LHS. And I did look at other cars in the luxury class and test drove them but the LHS was the one to have. The new styled front end reminded me of the 1970 chevy camaro LT1 with the split front bumper that was a awsome looking car. Anyway the over all shape of the body is very stream line and the 17&quot; chrome aluminum rims give it that new age sporty look. Then the 253 HP all aluminum engine 3.5-liter V6 has plenty of get up and go when you need it. It is a very smooth running engine and works great with the 4 speed O/D trany. The interior with its heated 8-way power driver and passenger front seats with two &quot;set&quot; memory controls when you unlock the door with the keyless entry it sets the seat, outside mirrors, and radio pre-set stations to your original settings and will do the same for the other keyless entry for another persons settings. The leather interior with the white faced gauges with a white faced analog clock in the middle of the dash gives it elegance,luxury and style. The sound system is unbelievable it is a  Infiniti II sound system (with new 4-disc in-dash CD changer), and 11 Infinity speakers which can boost up to 360-watt's. It is something to think about when buying a car there is nothing like good sounds when driving around (it does'nt mean you have to turn it up load) but at low level you should still here the quality of the system and out of all the cars I looked at this system sounds the best. Another neat feature is the driver-seat glide that makes entry and exit nearly effortless. The seat slides rearward when the key is removed. Not that you really need that but why not that's what helps make a luxury car luxury. 
The only thing I can say that I disliked about this vehicle is that there is a little more road noise in a LHS compared to equal valued luxury vehicles but know more noise then you would get from a Intreped or Camry or that price range of vehicle. But with the Infiniti II sound system all you will here is crisp clean music anyway. Driving this car definatley feels smooth like driving state of the art that's what you should expect from a new vehicle to. With a suspension designed to diminish front-end acceleration rise and brake dip to keep the body level the power assist steering is the feeling of having full control of the road. And when its time to stop the four-wheel disc antilock brake system provides positive, consistent pedal feel, plus increased fade resistance that works great with the Low-Speed Traction Control. The Low-Speed Traction Control functions at speeds up to 35 mph, and works in tandem with the antilock brakes and speed sensors to detect wheel-slip. The car comes pretty equipped but there are a few options you can add that won't raise the price of the car to bad and I got them all including the moon roof. 
Also you should know in the past the bad thing about buying a LHS is they dont hold their value to good a 1997 LHS is only worth about 15000.00 that is a big decline in value in just two to three years. So for the second hand buyer a car that new and equipped I think that is a great buy even throw its the old body style. Think about it you can spend 15000.00 for a new Ford Toras ( ya its new but we all know that wares off fast ) or spend the same amount or less for a two to three year old LHS and have performance luxury and all the bells and whistles including leather interior and they still come with a warrenty.If you do decide to buy a used LHS stay away from 1995, 1994 and anything under that year 95 and 94 had a lot of little problems with the cars which didn't help there popularity. But 1996 and up the problems are fixed and the car is very dependable. I also belive that the new body style (being more appealing) will hold their value. The first change in the body style came out in 1999 so it will be a couple of years before we find out if there holding there value or not but I am pretty confident they will. Look at the new dodge truck that truck holds its value better then any truck out there know and its only been since they changed the body style and know chevy and ford are pretty much coping that style. And I am true to heart a Chevy man but I would have to say Chrysler is my second choice. One more thing If your looking for performance luxury and head turning style then I would suggest you take the time to look over the LHS I am sure you will be pleased (I am ).

P.S  Good luck on car searching and I hope this helps you out.
