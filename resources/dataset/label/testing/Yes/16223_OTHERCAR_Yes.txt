            Last July after an incredible amount of shopping, my husband and I purchased a 1999 Corolla LE. Based on earlier versions of this car, I have to say I was truly impressed the from the first moment I sat in this car. The exterior is pleasing to the eye as well.

The interior is greatly improved over the previous models. Roomy for a small car, even in the back seat with 2 adults in the front. The ride is smooth, and it jets along with ease. I have not noticed any engine noise and the wind noise is limited.

The model we have has so many options. Air, cruise, cd player, which sounds very nice for a &quot;stock&quot; sound system, daytime running lamps and even an outdoor temperature gauge! One main concern I have is, should you have your window down and you for instance, use your windshield washer, I have found any excess fluid to drip into onto the drivers door armrest and onto the controls for the power windows and door locks. Water + electrical parts = potential problems. ( None so far however, knock on wood.)

 As far as safety features are concerned, it has dual air bags as well as the optional side impact air bags in the front seats. The only dislike I have about the side impact air bags is that they prevent you from putting seat covers on the seats due to the fact that they are set up to deploy right out of the side of the seat back. A slight drawback when you have a light colored interior. But, safety does come first.

The trunk is very spacious, and the rear seats are spilt 60/40 for fold down. They unfortunately do not fold completely flat. Also the pass-through from the trunk could be cut slightly taller.

This car gets very good gas mileage as well. I have not noted the exact mpg I get, but I know a full tank will take me almost 400 miles on a road trip. Good news considering gas prices these days. About $15 will fill the tank @ $1.59 per gallon.

Overall I am very pleased with this cars performance, comfort and accessories. You know what they say about Toyota's...&quot;It will last forever.&quot;
