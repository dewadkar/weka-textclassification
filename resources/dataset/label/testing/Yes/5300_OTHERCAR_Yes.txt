            If you haven't owned a Honda, I would highly recommend one.  They are stylish, roomier than you'ld guess at first glance, get great gas mileage, are very easy and comfortable to drive, and handle well on snow and ice.  Mechanically, they are very good too (of course you need to do the proper upkeep).  When you do need to have your honda repaired, the parts are generally available and qualified technicians are there to do the repairs.  I have owned a honda for over 12 years.  They just keep going!  The makes and models they are coming out with lately too are awesome!  <br><br>
