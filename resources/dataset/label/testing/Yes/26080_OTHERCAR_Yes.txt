            When you are expecting a child there are a lot of changes that have to be made. One of them is that you must have a reliable ride. The 1999 Mazda Protege is just that. This car has many of the extras, that more expensive cars brag about-for about half the price. Consumer Reports said that the 1999 Protege was one the safest vehicles of the year. The standard has truly risen for this one time lowly compact. Proteges are now issued with power windows and door locks. They are available with manual or automatic transmissions. A breezy air conditioner has kept us cool all summer. And though our son is not big enough to open those doors yet, the child safety locks will be very worth wild before we know it. The interior is roomier than the compacts of the past. The stereo is equipped with a CD player and pretty good speakers.The ride is smooth and it handles great.  This car is great for anyone on the go. The gas mileage is tremendous- 28 city, 33 highway. If you have more than two kids, you may need something a little bigger.<br>  My only problem with this car is not even a necessity. The cup holders are too small in my opinion. Aside from that, I love this car and so does my family!!<br><br>
