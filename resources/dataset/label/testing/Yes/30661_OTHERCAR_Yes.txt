            we brough this vehicle because we wanted something that was powerful sporty yet agile and we found it in the jeep grand cherokee.  I wanted it for the pulling power yet the way it fit around me.  I love the ride to be and suv yet it tends to ride like a car but taller. the thing i dont really like but can deal with is the gas milage  22\26 i hate to see the v8 oh boy but it is plenty strong enough for me.  to drive this vechicle is like almost driving a ful size sedan with the power to get up and get out of any situation and the passing is great i love the way it goes down the highway see i have a '97 grand cherokee but the 2000's that i have went to look at they were awesome all the things that the dealer usually programs in the vehicle right before you buy it you have control of like for instance the lights how they flash when you press your remote to lock the car and the horn may beep when you press to lock it you now have the option to turn it on or off at will that is so wonderful you will love either one you get.<br><br>
