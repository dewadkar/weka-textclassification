            About 5 months ago I purchased a 1990 Plymouth Laser RS, 5 speed, and I have to say that I'm more than satisfied with it.  I didn't know how to drive a 5 speed before this purchase but when the owner drove me around for a little demonstration drive, and I fell in love immediately!!

After I learned to drive it, I've been having loads of fun ever since.  It's got the 2.0 DOHC engine and for a 4-cyl, it really kicks.  The handling is exceptional with precise steering and good grip despite the torque laid down.   I wouldn't trade this car for any other.

The only problems I've had were a clutch replacement, hydraulic lifters in the hatchback gave out.. that's about it.   I think it's a really exceptional car.

I had to have the clutch replaced and the timing belt.  If you get one, change the timing belt as soon as you get it!  The previous owner had it break on him and it cost him $3000 to repair bent valves and such..
