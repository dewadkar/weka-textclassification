            I've owned my 1996 F-150 XLT (white w/red stripe along bottom) since the fall of 1995, so I'm coming up on six years with it.  I've covered over 194,000 miles in it so far -- going many places all over the Eastern half of the U.S. -- and it has never failed me.  It's by far the best vehicle I've ever owned and although I know sooner or later I'll have to get a new truck, I hope I never have to get rid of this one.

You won't see me write reviews of vehicles (or anything else) I have not owned or at least had extensive experience with.  To me, the most important factor is what it's like to live with a vehicle year in and year out, and that's what you'll learn about the F-150 from this review.

As a full-size pickup, the F-150 has all of the carrying capacity you'd expect in this type of vehicle.  I use mine to carry all kinds of things, including my motorcycle (Suzuki 1200 Bandit), which won't fit in small trucks without leaving the gate open.  The bed definitely shows some wear, but there is no rust anywhere on the truck, even after this long and this much use.

My truck is an XLT, 2-wheel drive model, which includes the 4.9 liter straight six (one of the best engines ever made, and it's a shame that 1996 was the last year for it), 5-speed manual transmission, a/c, power steering and brakes, AM/FM stereo cassette, power windows and locks, rear sliding window, bench seat with fold down center armrest.  I have had no problems whatsoever with any of the power accessories.  I would describe the sound quality of the stereo as average to good.  One area where Ford falls short of GM (at least in these '96 models) is in the audio department: Delco stereos do sound better, although this one isn't bad.  One of my favorite features is the leather-wrapped steering wheel with the cruise control buttons on it.  It's a very attractive wheel and it offers a driver's air bag.

The CFC-free air conditioner puts out lots of cold air and has not needed recharging since I have purchased the truck.  It's nicely integrated with the rest of the heating/air conditioning system and will run the a/c compressor when the defroster is running if the outside temperature is above 45 degrees or so.  This helps keep the windows clear by reducing the moisture level of the interior.

Driving the F-150, you find that it is a comfortable, safe handling (if not sporty) vehicle.  Obviously you do not have the same cornering and acceleration capabilities that you do in a performance-oriented car.  However, the F-150 has a very comfortable ride on the highway, soaking up road irregularities easily and without much disturbance to passengers inside.  It's not a light vehicle (roughly 4,000 lbs. dry), and this in my opinion helps the ride quality.  Handling is very safe and predictable.  

Of course, size has its pitfalls.  This is not a small vehicle to handle in parking lots.  The biggest problem is making the tight turns you sometimes have to make to get into a parking space.  Sometimes you wind up walking a little farther because you can find a more spacious parking slot farther away from the store.  A little extra exercise never hurt anyone, though, right?

With a large rear-drive vehicle like that that doesn't have a lot of weight over the rear wheels, you need to get some weight in the back if driving on snow or ice, because traction on those surfaces isn't too good.  I use some bags of sand (five 70 lb. bags), which helps a lot and makes traction as good as a car.  I live in Indiana and have never owned a 4-wheel drive because it's always seemed like a lot of extra money for something you could use on average 2 or 3 weeks a year (here).  

Acceleration is decent with the 4.9 liter six and the 5-speed box.  Mine has the tallest axle ratio, so it cruises very well on the highway, with 70 mph speeds being relaxed and effortless.  There's little or no engine noise, and the gas mileage isn't terrible given the size and aerodynamics (of lack thereof) of this vehicle.  If you're going 55 or 60 and need a burst of power, it helps to be in fourth rather than fifth gear.  The cruise control holds a very constant speed, and has a feature in which it will automatically disengage if the vehicle loses 6 mph off of the pre-set speed.  I like this feature because it saves gas and wear, reminding the driver to downshift and drive manually rather than just let the cruise hold the pedal to the floor.

Gas mileage is about what you'd expect for a truck like this.  I find that mine doesn't vary much at all in the city versus highway.  This truck can be expected to deliver roughly 17 to 19 miles per gallon in the summer and 16 to 17 miles per gallon in the winter (on the winter blend of gas they switch to in the cold weather).  With slow highway cruising (55 to 60), you can squeeze out 20 mpg if you're really lucky.

My truck has the dual fuel tank option, so it holds a total of 37.2 gallons of gas, making for a nice cruising range of 600 miles or more.  If you own this truck or buy one you will realize that with the dual tanks, when you're using the rear tank the fuel level seems to go down much faster than the front but this is actually because the extra fuel which is pumped by the fuel pump but not burned by the engine is returned not to the tank it came from but always to the front.  To illustrate this, here's what happens:  You fill up both tanks, activate the front tank, drive on that one until it's empty, then switch to the rear, and drive on that one until it shows empty.  Time to buy gas, right?   Well, not necessarily.  Flip back to the front and you'll find that you have 1/4 to 1/3 of a tank which has "refueled itself" using fuel pumped from the rear but not used, so returned to the front.

This truck is not badly affected by the wind.  It has a relatively low center of gravity and is easy to keep under control in all circumstances.  Insurance statistics rate this as one of the safest vehicles on the road.

In the nearly 200,000 miles that I have covered, I have had very few problems.  Here is a summary of this truck's minimal repair and maintenance needs:

Every 5,000 miles I've changed the oil and filter, and about every 60,000 or so the spark plugs.  I got rid of the original General Ameriway XT tires at 83,000 miles and got a set of Michelin XCX APTs, which are still on there, those tires having traveled over 110,000 miles.  I'll probably get a new set within 10,000 miles.  You have to rotate the tires periodically on this truck if you want long tire life because the twin I-beam suspension setup causes the front tires to cup some if left on there too long.  

I've changed the serpentine belt a couple of times because after a couple of years it starts to make a chirping sound as the truck idles, and I've drained and replaced the lubricant in the transmission and differential a couple of times each as well.

The slave cylinder in the transmission started to leak at 112,000 miles.  As replacement of it on the Mazda transmission in this truck requires removal of the transmission, this led me to schedule this truck's first visit for service by anyone but me -- at 112,000 miles.  The repair cost $630 and included replacement of the clutch disc, which, while not worn much at all, had been contaminated by the fluid leaking on it.

The front brake pads were replaced at 139,000 miles and again very recently at 191,000.  The second replacement wasn't really necessary except that the front rotors had become so warped that the truck pulsated annoyingly during braking.  When I changed the rotors I went ahead and got new pads.

At around 120,000 I had new u-joints put in.  The originals were getting noisy.

That's pretty much the size of it.  It still has the original battery, and has only needed one new headlight and tail light bulb.  There has never been a day when it has broken down or failed to start.

This is a very satisfying vehicle to own and drive.  I like everything about it, and it is the best, most faithful truck I've ever had.
