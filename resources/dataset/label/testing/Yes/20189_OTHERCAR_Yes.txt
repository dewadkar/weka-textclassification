            My dad bought this S304 camera, and I've been using it for a few months now. I'm so in love with this camera, it is so much better than my old Fujifilm 1400Z camera.  First some details.

Yes this camera supports 3.3 megapixel resolution. You can save the images as TIF, and JPEG files on the compact flash card. 
It comes with a rather small 16 meg card which only lets you take around 12 images or so at FINE mode. So you really must get another memory card. I'd suggest a 64 meg card, that'll get you 40 pictures depending on the resolution you use and compression settings.

The 4x optical zoom is outstanding...most digital cameras only offer 2x or 3x optical zoom.  I have seen some that offer 6x optical zoom but they usually couple that with low resolution CCD's (2 megapixels).  
Nothing beats having more resolution, the 3.3 megapixels is incredible. Sometimes its TOO detailed because I've noticed just about everyone has pretty bad skin these days. Some people might not like the massive closeups you get with this camera. (just the subjects, the photographer loves it heh heh)
Seriously though, the color and resolution are far superior to my Fuji 1400. They just appear more vivid and real. The red-eye reduction mode is also superior, it flashes 3 times in a row, and does a double flash when taking normal pictures. 
This camera has a ton of cool features that the "prosumer" can take advantage of. It even lets you adjust the white balance, shutter speed, and manual focusing. 
Of course it supports macro mode which lets you take closeup pictures.  
Another big improvement from my old Fuji 1400 is the processor speed. This S304 comes with a 32 bit risc processor. That means, cycling through pictures during playback is extremely fast. It used to take a few seconds per picture just to move from one picture to the next on my Fuji, but the minolta s304 processes things so much faster.
It also supports VIDEO out, so you can set up a slideshow on a tv set. It has a built in slideshow viewer. you can adjust how many seconds to spend on each picture, and you can select ahead of time which pictures to include in the slideshow! Whoever wrote the firmware (software) on this puppy was good! I like how intuitive the interface is...it has tons of features but all the most commonly used ones are easy to find. 

There are only two things I don't like about the design of this camera. First, whenever you use it whether to take pictures or playback existing pictures, or to use the USB port to transfer pictures, it extends the lense out. I don't see why it has to extend the lense..it wastes battery life and also you have to be sure not to have anything in front of the lense or it gets blocked and shuts down (to protect the motor).  This seems like a stupid design decision...oh well.
Ok the second thing I don't like, is that the selector you use to change the modes from record picture to playback picture, to USB mode, is too easy to accidently flip. I have often accidentily turned the camera on while just holding it in my hand!  I think if its in a loose fit bag, it'll get turned on by mistake too. I'm going to have to take the batteries out if I go traveling with it. 
I think perhaps the switch they used, is too easy to turn...it doesn't have enough resistance to rotate.
Its possible the one I got is slightly defective...

One last thing before I forget...it comes with 4 AA alkaline batteries. that is idiotic because the nature of this camera is such that you can only take 7 or 8 pictures using a fresh set of AA alkalines!! It sucks up the power on those alkalines too fast and ruins the batteries. I am using NiCAD and NiMH AA batteries, and so far they've given me around 60 or 70 pictures on each set.  
You can always get those high density NiMH 1800's..those will last longer. I'm only using 1400's
