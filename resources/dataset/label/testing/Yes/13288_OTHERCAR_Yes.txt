            Yes! Yes! Yes! I love this car! No other machine in my life has made me feel this way. Sure all those motorcycles were fast and sexy, but there is something indefinable here that just makes me go bonkers. Wait a minute, maybe it can be defined. This is the perfect road car. 

The looks. O.K. its not a Ferrari, but I still get excited to drive it when walking towards it in the parking lot. The deep green paint has just the right metallic shine and has proven to be durable and scratch resistant. The aluminum wheels look great and clean up easily. The small amount of chrome trim around the windows adds a very classy touch. 

Inside, the leather smells great, and begs to be touched. The dash is perfectly laid out. Every control feels great and looks luxury to boot. The seats rule! Infinite adjustability and perfect support, combined with a comfortable driving position make long trips feel like time at a day spa. The stereo is pretty good too. There are acres of useable storage space. My 6'2&quot; 290 Lb. Dad fits in the back seat. The trunk is huge. The fake wood looks real (and thereï¿½s not too much of it).

With the 200 horsepower, 200 lb. ft. of torque V-6 Engine, you will be embarrassing teen punks in their V-6 Mustangs and Camaros at every stoplight. And this powerhouse motor is dreamy smooth and quiet. And it gets great gas mileage. And on and on and on.

If you are living in the real world, and need a car, this is what you need. Oh yeah, it goes up those steep gravel driveways real good too, so you people who &quot;need&quot; an &quot;S&quot; &quot;U&quot; V., might want to consider the Accord as well.
