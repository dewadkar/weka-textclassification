            I love to drive this car.  Open top, lots of power, 5-speed manual, instant four-wheel-drive on command.  Go anywhere off-road tires.  I feel like I could conquer Death Valley (as writers for MotorTrend magazine did), or conquer rush hour traffic in a fun and relaxing way.

I can't help but smile with the wind in my hair and the sun shining down.  If the sun was shining in liquid form however, I would leave this one at home.  The soft top leaks and produces almost as much highway noise as does not having a top on at all.

However if the inside gets wet, oh well, even soaked to the core it was dry again in 3-4 hours with no mold or bad smells.

If you are looking for a good off-road vehicle, or maybe a now and again commuter that you could take on a nice kayaking trip than look no further.  If you want a fuel-efficient commuter vehicle or a vehicle you could drive every day maybe you should consider something of the car variety rather than a gas-guzzling SUV.

But every Jeep I pass gets me a wave and an ear-to-ear grin from the driver.  As someone told me once, it's a Jeep thing.  You just have to drive one to understand.<br><br>
