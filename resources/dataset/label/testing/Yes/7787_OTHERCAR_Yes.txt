            So the big question Acura, Lexus, or ? I test drove everything on four wheels to find out what would work best for my needs.  First test drive Lexus es300 ok but a little soft for my taste.  IS300 getting warmer but a little small on the inside and poor fuel economy.  Next stop BMW 3's ultimate driving machine? Only the M3 and some of the 5 series but you'll pay for it every step of the way. Maybe Subaru's WRX exterior is an acquired taste, fit and feel seem a little cheap, but turbo AWD and stick or automatic are good choices with this one but not exactly what I had in mind.  Toyota, Nissan, MBZ, ect not too impressed.

Finally Acura TL Type S everything that a daily driver needs plus a little fun for the weekend.  Does the TL type S have a stiffer ride yep! my grandfather doesn't like it but doesn't seem to bother anyone under 50.  You'll do sub 7s seconds 0-60 stock don't believe me take it to the track and find out yourself.  Car really shines when entering the freeway or having to pass.  You pull 2250rpm at 80mph and its smooth as glass.  Set the cruise control or the next time you look down you'll be over 100mph.  Even at 130mph it still has more to give maybe 150?.  Interior fits like a glove and has tons of standard options.  A few of my favorites, heated seats, memory seat, heated mirrors with blue tint.  Exterior clean lines front and back looks good from any angle 17" rims and HID Lights.  I drive at least 100 miles per day and get 25mpg.  This car is just fun to drive period.  Dare to compare dollar for dollar, fit and feel are second to nothing in its class.  I paid dealer invoice for my 2002 TL type S 3/1/2002.

The only bad thing I found so far is the audio system.  Bose 6cd in dash 4 speakers in the doors and a 9" powered woofer in the back.  Speakers sound cheap! Highs are like dull midrange yuck! It just sounds muddy! But a change in speakers should solve this problem.
