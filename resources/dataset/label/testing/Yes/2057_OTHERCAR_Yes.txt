            I currently own a 97 Yukon, and I just bought a new 00' Yukon.  This new model is so much better, I can't believe it!  Now, most non-loyal GMC people will take awhile to get used to the new look, but when they do, they can't take their eyes off it!  This new model looks more compact and has MORE storage space, plus the new engine selections give you the option of having lotsa power, or just enough.  Another good little feature available on the new Yukon is the independent rear suspension, this gives you a luxury car like ride, in an SUV!  I think that this is the perfect car for anyone in the market for an SUV, because it has the luxury, the power, the comfort, and the good old GM quality.

I'm a die-hard GM fan, and I try to convert as many people as I can, I hope that this review will change your mind about buying that Expedition or Explorer.  All I can say about this truck is... WOW!!!
