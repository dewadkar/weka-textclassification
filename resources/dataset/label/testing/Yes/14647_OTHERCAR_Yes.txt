            Around 1996 my ex and I decided that it was time to purchase another car.  My old 1993 Dodge was starting to rack up the miles, so this became a necessity.  After looking at some used cars at the local dealers, we came upon our Midnight Black, 1991 Hyundai Scoupe.

At the time of purchase, it retailed for about $5000 (used).  This was a fair price I felt due to the low miles it had, and the excellent condition of the components.  Today, expect that the car will sell much lower...also realizing that the average condition of these vehicles will be substantially less perfect than before.

Upon entering the car, one thing is immediately obvious: at 6'0&quot; tall, this car isn't quite built for someone of my height.  While not totally debilitating, it is hard at times to get comfortable.  In order for me to drive it, I had to put the front seat back as far as it would go.  OK, if there's no one else that needs to travel with you.  My Scoupe was equipped with a sunroof (while discussing the interior).  This made the ride much more enjoyable.  While there's really nothing too special about sunroofs, it enhanced the sporty look of the little coupe.
Leg room is quite good on the passenger side up front, with not much in the way in the footbox.  Some cars I've owned have had horrid obstructions in the footwell area...and this just makes being a passenger a miserable experience.

Concerning the powertrain, there was one choice for the engine: an &quot;under 2.0 liter&quot; 4 cylinder.  Coupled to it was a standard equipped 5-speed, or a decent 4 speed automatic.  Mine had the 5 speed, and with a light body such as the Scoupe, it offered  VERY healthy performance.  While not a car in line with models such as Mustang or Camaro, it wouldn't leave you trying to accelerate JUST to stay out of traffic's way.
This 4 cylinder was also economical, giving us mileage in the low 30's per gallon.  Not too shabby.  Some cars don't give that TODAY.
Our car didn't use oil, never had a major component failure, etc.  As far as its past was concerned (what happened when its previous owner had it) was a mystery, but we had a good solid car, we felt.

A major area of concern with the Korean automobiles today is with the brakes.  The Scoupe was no exception, but the brakes were still decent enough to provide ample stopping power in all conditions.  In hilly areas, you may experience brake fade, but no so severe that the car won't atop.  See, the Scoupe is essentially a larger, heavier version of their 2/4 door grocery-getter of the past, the Excel.  So, the rolling chassis is identical...suspension and all.  This heavier body wasn't too critical a concern, though.

Reliability is also an issue with Korean cars.  Yes, we have heard the Hyundai/Kia/Daewoo/Samsung horror stories, but the only thing I ever had to replace were the distributor cap, rotor, and wires.  Even then, the Scoupe never left us stranded.  I feel that Hyundai really did a good job developing their 4 cylinder.  Now, I may be biased...as I'm sure some have had nightmare stories with THEIR cars, but this is to be expected.  (I just read last night of a 1999 Cougar owner that paid $20000 for a car with NUMEROUS defects and RUST....in Las Vegas!!!)

Good looks, sporty handling, and economical...yet spirited performance...sounds like a great car.  And it was.  I miss the Scoupe more than my ex!<br><br>
