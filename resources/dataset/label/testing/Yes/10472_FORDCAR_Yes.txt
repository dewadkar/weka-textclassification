            This '93 Ford ranger is the best vehicle I have ever owned. In the seven years I have had this truck, I have only needed to fix one thing - a battery clamp. Other automobiles may have performed as well as my truck, but probably couldn't have taken as much abuse.  Until recently I had only changed the oil three times since I bought it.  Once it hit 70,000 miles I thought I better start taking better care of this truck, and now change the oil about every 5,000 miles.  It has been used to move members of my family and friends across town, to other cities, and even to other states--often overloaded while doing so.  And still runs as well as the day I bought it.  It is the most reliable truck for all purposes. For example, when friends and family are stranded by their own vehicles my truck can always be counted on to save the day.  It has never left me hanging. This is a good vehicle for men or women.  Great work truck also.<br><br>
