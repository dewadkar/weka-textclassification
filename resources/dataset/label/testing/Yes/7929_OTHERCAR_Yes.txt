            March 18, 2001.  Here is an update, one year later to the review I wrote a year ago...

My Jeep is exceeding all my expectations.  I have experienced no servicable problems, just the 3000 mile oil change I get done at One Stop Oil Change in Orleans Massachusetts (great people).  I'm still extremely pleased and why not!  No problems, solid and dependable transportation.

Okay, I'll admit it!  I'm a 40-something guy, I've been driving junks since 92 and I never wanted a "Real" Jeep.  That was until a few months ago!  I bought my first Jeep, it's used but it is "My Jeep".  My girlfriend says I'm going through something she calls "maturity regression!"  My friends say my Jeep is impractical.  My family, well my family can never figure me out anyway!

I absolutely love "My Jeep"!  It's a 1997 TJ Wrangler with "round headlights!"  Any serious self-respecting Jeep owner wouldn't be caught dead in a Jeep with rectangular headlights.  It came with the 4-cylinder engine and a 5 speed manual transmission.  It has shift on the fly four-wheel drive.  I have the soft-top.  A decision I made after many conversations with both soft-top and hardtop owners.

"My Jeep" gets about 22 MPG on regular unleaded gasoline.  The options include all the standard stuff, nothing fancy.  I installed a Kenwood AM/FM Cassette player with removable faceplate, retiring the original Chrysler AM/FM Stereo Radio. (See my Kenwood review for more details)

"My Jeep" handle like, well, it handles like a Jeep.  The suspension is truckish, rather stiff.  The power steering on "My Jeep" is quick and responsive.  I have power brakes, a feature that I appreciate.  I do not have ABS and I don't recommend ABS if you plan any off-road adventures.

"My Jeep" is built solid without rattles of clanging sounds.  Not a bad condition after 47,000 miles.  Jeeps have no trunk space and storage is extremely limited.  The back seat is easily removed which adds a large open space for coolers, suitcases and traveling supplies.  The front bucket seats are extremely comfortable, they recline and the passenger side bucket seat has a neat gizmo that pivots it forward and out of the way.  Passengers still have a hard time getting in the back.

Needless to say the underbody clearance is huge.  Visibility is excellent because the Jeep sits higher than a normal automobile.  You can actually see over the top of vehicles in front of you.

"My Jeep is a dream come true!  It is a solid, rugged, dependable, peppy vehicle.  I don't care if I'm suffering from regressive maturity!  I Love "My Jeep"!
