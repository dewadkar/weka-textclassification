            I'm a current owner of a '98 Prelude and I'm very happy with it overall.  The car offers a great driving position, good stereo but needs more base, terrific and sharp handling for a front wheel drive car, minor torque steer over bumpy roads, excellent gas mileage (consistently gets 28mpg in mostly highway driving), strong brakes and mechanically very reliable.  I've also surprisingly gotten a lot of complements on how good the car looks.  What I don't like is the chassis, it is still not strong enough - the car still wiggles when you hit uneven bumps. The doors slam with a tin can sound (very Japanese), the horn sounds like a 2 yr old kid screaming (don't understand why so many Japanese cars have such wimpy horns, I'm embarrassed to use it), the trunk area emits a strange loose body panel sound, needs a taller 5th or 6th gear because the engine get noisy cruising above 75, and not much torque.  As an avid motorcyclist, this car has a great open road feel with great visibility and fairly strong (after 5000rpm), smooth revving engine.  The interior is limited, but it's perfect for a single person.  I'm beginning to get more rattling noise as the car approaches 23K - which is very surprising considering Honda has a legendary fit &amp; finish reputation (especially from the back somewhere in the trunk or rear quarter panels).  The driver side window seems to be out of track every once in awhile too.<br><br>
