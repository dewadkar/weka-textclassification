            I bought my 2000 Toyota Corolla VE last May.  I needed a reliable, economical car that I could depend on to get me through college, and after some searching I came across the Corolla.  The first thing that struck me was the price- I had been initially thinking of something like the Echo, but the Corolla was a MUCH better value in terms of options, size, looks, etc.  

I love just about everything about my Corolla.  It gets GREAT gas mileage, even with the air conditioning on full-blast (hey, it's Florida!).  I had the windows tinted and bought some really neat hubcaps from Hubcap Heaven (the Toyota hubcaps are way too expensive...save some money and buy your own!) so now my car looks pretty sleek....it's suprising how well it &quot;dresses up&quot;.  I had the CD player installed, and the system is VERY impressive for a factory system. The car handles great...the way the streets and businesses are situated around here causes me to make sharp turns and U-turns all the time, and the Corolla turns on a dime.  

Probably my only wish would be for better acceleration while moving.  It accelerates fine from a dead stop, but it takes a little effort to get it to go into passing gear in traffic.  Also, I was a little taken aback at how Toyota charges so much for the extra options.  But, it's all high quality stuff.  For things like window tinting, hubcaps, floormats, etc; my suggestion would be to just buy that stuff from aftermarket sources....you'd definately save money.  

Overall, the Corolla is an awesome car.  I'd reccommend it to anyone!<br><br>
