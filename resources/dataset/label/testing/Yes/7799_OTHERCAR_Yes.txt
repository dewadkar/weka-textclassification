            Fuji Finepix S2 Pro Digital-SLR Camera: 

I have owned this camera since 2002 and I have been impressed since day one. I have spent lots of time behind the lenses of many legendary Nikon SLR film cameras and I had been leaning towards the Nikon D100 to move me into the D-SLR spectrum. Without rehashing (yet another) comparision between these two cameras, I can simply tell you --- I personally like the S2 better. At the time of the decision, was it to try something different? (as most of my photography buddies, and most Nikonions) had already gone with the D100? Probably in part and also in part because I felt I gained alot and lost nothing in return by going with the Fuji S2 over the D100. 

The Fuji S2 has served me well and with over 20,000 pictures taken on this one chassis alone, I can honestly say that I would purchase it again without a hesitation. It has always performed well from the rainforests & ruins in Belize, to the cityscape of Atlanta to the sidelines of professional sporting events, I have been extremely impressed with this camera. The warm, clean, crisp pictures it captures are simply second to none. The options, controls, & displays are all carefully laid out with a nice, clean professional touch. The standard SLR options and in-depth feature controls are plentiful and span the entire arsenal of professional photography needs. 

I have an entire gambit of lenses (over 30 now) and I have never had one problem with compatibility, fit, focus or performance. I mainly use Sigma and Nikon (Nikkor) build lenses and I have been quite pleased with the results. For storage on this S2, I use mainly the IBM 1GB Microdrives, or the newer Sandisk 1GB Ultra II CF cards that are faster and use less battery life to perform the task of saving high-res images (+37MB in RAW mode) This camera always works --- and that is important.

To this day, I am still using this camera for most of my shooting events and I am proud of this unit and the results I get from using it. I have taken award-winning macro photography (using the Sigma 50mm & 105mm lenses with 1.4TC) --- spectacular wildlife shots (printed in magazines with Sigma 50-500mm lens and Nikon 80-400mm VR) and many other fantastic captures. While the tool does not make the photographer, this camera will certainly provide you everything you need to achieve that next level of ability, photographic results and satisfaction gained from using professional equipment.

I recommend this camera to anyone serious about getting into the professional D-SLR arena.
