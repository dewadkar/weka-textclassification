            I wanted to get a digital camera which felt like my old SLR but would allow me to overstep the whole film aspect of photography. A real SLR digital with interchangable lenses was still quite a bit out of reach due to the cost but with the Minolta D'image7i's huge zoom range and good lens why would I want to be carrying several lenses around anyway. I also wanted the large maximum image size to potentially produce 8"x10" prints at a later date.

The D'image 7i has a combination of automatic features and manual features which allows the reasonably experienced photographer to have a lot of control over the photo. I mainly  wanted a camera which allowed manual control of the aperture, exposure duration and focus and this camera allows that and more. I also wanted automatic controls and settings as well. It has good white balance settings for taking pics under different lightings and also has some colour controls which can be set to bias the shots towards different colour settings.

Information on the eye viewfinder or the back screen is thorough and lets you see all useful data for your pic before taking it. This includes warnings for insufficient light or exposure times which will result in underexposed or blurred shots. 

Settings to change the exposure to take a series of quick pics one after the other (great for action shots like animals or children so you can pick out that perfect photo from several later ) as well as the ability to take short movies with sound add more useful settings.

One of my favorite features I didn't see in any other camera I was considering is the rubberized manual zoom ring around the lens. This is a major reason why this camera feels so much like taking my old SLR out for some photo taking. I can zoom so easily and quickly and naturally  that a motorized zoom seems like a silly use of technology in comparison.

Another great feature is the ability to choose image size and image resolution separately. My old simpler digital had the higher resolutions tied to image size so I couldn't take a smaller pic at a high image quality on that camera. With the D'image 7i I can take smaller pics (meant for onscreen viewing only) at the highest resolution setting.

I'd suggest people get several sets of rechargable batteries ("Quest" brand are good). Also setting the camera to the eye view finder and setting that screen to go off when your eye is away from it (yes it has a sensor to sense when you are looking through the view finder ) can save power.

Downloading to the computer is simple as it is read as a removable storage device and I can just go there in windows
explorer and copy the files off. 

All said, I'm very pleased with this camera
