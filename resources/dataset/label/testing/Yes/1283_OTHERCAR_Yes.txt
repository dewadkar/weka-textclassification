            I choose the Nikon 990 due to its massive resolution ability and its super functionally.  My personal and professional use of this camera has proven to me without a doubt that I made a good choice.  The camera is fast and easy to use.  The image quality is outstanding.  The ability to add attachments like a 2X doubler, Fish Eye lens, filters, and even a parabolic 360-degree mirror for virtual tour shots makes this camera an all out winner.  Personally I have the 2X doubler and the Fish Eye lens along with a few filters and it works great.  However in low light scenarios a aux. Flash unit is required as the camera's built-in flash can not flash when a lens attachment is on.  And a tripod is recommend in low light areas and especially when using lens attachments.  However, with a tripod, aux. Flash, and the 2X doubler I have take wonderful night shots that looked like they where taken during the day time.  I also added a 80MB Compact Flash Card to my camera, in conjunction with the 16MB that came with the camera I can take anywhere from 90 (High Resolution Images) to hundreds of differing lower resolution images.<br><br>
