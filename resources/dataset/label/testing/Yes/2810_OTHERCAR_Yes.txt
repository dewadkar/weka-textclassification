            The Olympus D-400 Zoom is a great camera. I use it for taking pictures of lots of stuff, and the photographs come out fantastic. However, make sure that you use the higher-quality photo setting, for the best results. I would also recommend buying a larger memory card than the 8 megabyte card it comes with to be able to hold more pictures. 16 megabyte and 32 megabyte cards are good.

This camera has many great features, such as the LCD screen and the incredible zoom. You can set it to view pictures as soon as you take them, which is a great feature, because if you take a bad picture you can erase it and take it over again. Also, I like the index feature, which allows you to view 4, 9, or 16 pictures on the screen at once and move between them easily.

To get the most out of this camera, you should get some decent photo editing software. The Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home Edition software it comes with is good, but for more advanced features you should get Adobe Photoshop or Adobe PhotoDeluxe Business Edition.<br><br>
