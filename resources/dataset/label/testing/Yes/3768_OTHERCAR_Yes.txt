            In 1998 I bought a 1997 Chevy 1/2 ton extended cab silverado truck. I was looking for a good used truck for a good price. I had a friend who is a used car salesman for a local Chevrolet dealer helping me in my search. It wasn't long before he found a truck he thought I would like. He was right. It was the color I preferred and had the options I wanted plus a few more. I bought the truck and fell in love with it right away. I had typically owned Ford trucks and this was my second Chevy truck. I don't think I will ever own another Ford. This Chevy is the best vehicle I have ever owned. It rides like a car but works like a truck and to this day has never given me a bit of trouble. My wife and I have 2 other vehicles and I prefer driving my truck rather than the other 2. By the way the other vehicles are a Suburban and a Pontiac Grand Prix. I would recommend a Chevy truck to anyone needing a good dependable vehicle. <br><br>
