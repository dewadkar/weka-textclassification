            I bought my husband this camera as an early Christmas gift. He loves it, He is a camera buff and has many but this is his very favorite. He has carried everyday since getting it. You snap a picture just like with a regular camera but then you can look into the view finder and see it. If you don;t like it you just hit the button and erase it.Depending on which setting you have the camera  on you can take different numbers of shots.
Once you are happy with what you see you just download to your p.c. and then you can print them on photo quality paper. ( regular paper is too thin) Beware though that pictures printed on your home p.c. will fade faster then those done the old fashion way.Also uses a lot of ink to print.<br><br>
