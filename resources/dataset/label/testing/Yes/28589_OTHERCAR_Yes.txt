            Let me just say that the Jeep Wrangler has always been my dream car. I am 18 and I have already had 2 cars. I am hoping my next will be a Jeep Wrangler though. I have driven a friend's and have loved it ever since. It handles very well, gives off a great feeling of control and freedom at the same time, and manages to keep a very sporty look which is the envy of many! Having a Jeep Wrangler as a teenager would be the absolute greatest thing and would definitely be the envy of your friends.
The Jeep Wrangler handles well on ice, wet roads, dirt roads and gravel, and of course regular paved roads. I know from experience that it is a truly reliable car. Besides it's reliability it comes in different models, these being Sport, Sahara, and SE. You can buy a brand new Wrangler for just a little bit over $20,000 with ALL options included. That is very cheap for a new car, especially a SUV. Overall I wish I could have one and I hope you get one if you are even thinking about it!<br><br>
