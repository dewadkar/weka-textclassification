            I was looking for a ar not to long ago when i thought about getting a 98 Ford Mustang GT.  I went to the local dealership and testdrove it.  I was rather impressed with the car.  It had greeat power and handling, a good stereo, power everything and it looked good. 

The price on the car was rather high though.  My friend just got a '00 Mustang and i have ridden with him a few times and i really dont like his car as much as i did the 98. Of coarse you can tell that there is going to be a difference between a coupe and a GT, but i liked the body style a little better plus there was a little more room in the '98 rather than the '00.

As far as power it isnt really that fair to compare that because they were different sizes of engines but another friend of mine had a 96 and it fealt like it had more power than the 00 does but the 00 semd to handle better.

Personally i like the older ones better the ultimate would be the 64 1/2  but then i like the late 80's and the early 90's  especially with the 5.0 engine. <br><br>
