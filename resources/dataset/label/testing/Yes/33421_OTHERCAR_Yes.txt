            &quot;See those railroad tracks?  Punch it, and tell me what you feel.&quot;  I was surprised when the car dealer who had taken me on a test drive told me this.  Well I punched, and we went over the tracks.  What did I feel?  Absolutly nothing.  The car has that smooth of a ride.  Quiet as a whisper too.  The body style is very sporty and the silver paint job can't be matched in beauty.  Everything about this car was great.  Acceleration, braking distance, stereo, trunk space, and the full size spare that comes with it.  Also even the base model has remote keyless entry.  Another plus is the warrenty.  I can't remember specifics, but it was by far the best of all the cars I test drove.  The only drawback is that Jettas are in high demand so you will not get a good deal, which sucks because for a midsize car the Jetta is a tad expensive in my opinion.  But overall this was the best car I've ever driven. <br><br>
