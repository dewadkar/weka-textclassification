            I own a Chevy Camaro and it was the smartest thing I ever did. It seems they have more, and more horsepower every year. My Camaro hugs the road like a sports car. I have the classic v-8 and it uses the gas of a smaller sedan. I've never had to take it to the shop and it starts the first time every time. If you want to pull out and pass with the Camaro, you'll have no problems . It accelerates very quickly and all you have to do is come out of over-drive into drive and let it take over.<br><br>
