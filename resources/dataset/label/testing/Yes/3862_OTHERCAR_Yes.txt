            Oh yeah baby, The only vehicle meant for a man of 6'5&quot;. The Yukon Denali or the Cadillac Escalade. My father was the 6th in Ontario to own one. Here is a list of major pros and cons about the vehicle as a whole. I am 6'4&quot; myself now and I still enjoy the luxuries of this classy Yukon.
The only time it had to go to the shop was because of human error. And No it wasn't my fault. The model year was 1999, but there was an early order because of the Denali in a sort of testing stage, so my Dad got it in '98.

Pros:

Excellent Driver / Front Passenger Leg Room!!!!!
Excellent Head Room (Front &amp; Rear Seats)
Lots of room in Trunk
Most Yukon options come standard on the Denali
Heated Front &amp; Rear Seats
Rear A/C &amp; Stereo Controls
Highly adjustable front seats

Cons:

OnStar GPS Navigation system is optional
No leg room in Rear Seating
No Television (As in Montana or Suburban Sony Edition)
Large Rear Blind Spot<br><br>
