            I bought this vehicle in Dallas, Texas in 1998 after purchasing an 850 GLT 1996 wagon two years earlier.  I loved my first volvo, and it is at 56,000 miles now and has not yet been in the shop for anything but routine maintanance.  The 1998 Volvo is an S90 SE, which is the top model but with a special woodtrim piece on the steering wheel and tweeters built in to the panal between the front and rear doors.  It is rear wheel drive, and was discontinued in '99.  I bought mine for $28K since it was on sale, but the retail was quite higher.  Two weeks before I moved to Iowa I had starting problems.  The dealership put in a new battery and it was loaded on the car carrier a few days later, appearing to be fixed.  When I got it off the carrier it would start only once every 10 minutes, (ex. if u turned it off you would have to wait 10 minutes or more to start it again), as well as the winter mode dash light blinking on and off, and the driver's power seat not functioning at all.  It has yet to be fixed, and the nearest dealership is a couple hours away.  When the dealership gets it fixed I may sell it, because it gets stuck in the driveway.  I may as well park it in the garage until spring.  However, I will score this car omitting the rare problem I occured and assuming I still lived in Texas, where it performed with excellence.  It is safe, comfortable, quiet, and has many unique features that makes it a great family car.  It is a vehicle that has elegance and is up there with Lexes, Saab, BMW, and Mercedes.  Any person living in a warm climate with or without a family would enjoy this vehicle.<br><br>
