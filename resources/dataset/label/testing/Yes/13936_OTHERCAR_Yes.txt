            When I told my friends I was buying a &quot;station wagon&quot; they all ribbed me about turning into a soccer mom. The joking stopped when they got to drive my '98 Subaru Outback.

This car is fun to drive. The 5 speed manual transmission has surprisingly perky pick-up for a car this size. It accelerates well and cruises comfortably at both highway and sight-seeing speeds. The taller stature of the Outback allows you to feel comfortable driving among the larger SUVs without sacrificing the maneuverability and gas mileage of a car. Essentially you get the best of both worlds! 

The exterior of the Subaru Outback is better looking than your average station wagon with two toned paint which gives it a sporty look. The standard roof racks and high clearance make the Outback look ready for action.

The standard interior is a bit dull so I opted for leather seats. I was a little bit leery of having leather seats with two big dogs, but after learning how much easier it is to get mud, drool, and dog hair off of leather, I will never go back to fabric covered seats again. 

My car is a few years old and it is holding up very well. The paint is still glossy and looks great (which is saying a lot given that it is constantly exposed to California sun). The engine runs as smoothly as it did new, and has given me no problems what so ever.

The only problem I have had at all was a broken switch on the interior dome light. Subaru replaced the switch at no charge while I was having regular maintenance performed on the car so it was a very minor inconvenience.

Over all I am very pleased with my car and I would highly recommend it to anyone who asks.<br><br>
