            I just had to have an Eclipse.  I picked out a smooth looking red one at a local dealership and I was on my way.  Very shortly on my way I encountered engine problems.  I had an oil leak that cost me around $500 to fix.  I had to replace all the lugnuts and some of the actual lugs too, about 6 months after purchase.  That cost around $75.  The spark plugs misfired which was yet another trip to the repair shop.  Make sure you check under the hood before you buy one!! Plus in city driving, be very careful backing out of drive ways and on dips, the eclipse bottoms out soo easily.  The pro's are that it drives smooth and goes fast.  Plus you'll look cool, if you're actually driving it and it's not sitting in the shop.<br><br>
