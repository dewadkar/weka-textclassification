            The Mercedes-Benz SL class, one of my favorite classes, made one of the most remarkable cars I've ever known of. The SL600 is legendary, not just for its price but for its quality. The 1997 Mercedes-Benz SL600, a two-door, two-passenger, coupe/roadster with 6.0-liter, double-overhead-cam, 48-valve, fuel-injected V-12 and electronic five-speed automatic transmission, is by far, the most luxurious and safe car, in my opinion, that is. Not that I can afford one right now, but hopefully one day I can live the legends I've heard.

Owners of the Mercedes-Benz SL roadsters are, understandably, a diverse variety. 
After all, they drive what many regard as to be the best, most deluxe two-seat convertibles in the world. 
And they think it's OK to drop a growing of $79,000 for a solitary car. 
In fact, for many, the SL is only one of more than a few cars they own. According to Mercedes, 49 percent of SL owners have four or more vehicles, and it's not unusual to find that one of those other vehicles is another Mercedes. 
Can you even dream of that? 
I tried and tried to envision it the other week just driving the car, cruising and swerving around other people, feeling safer than ever on the road.
It's beyond doubt, a breathtaking piece of equipment with a 389-horsepower V-12 under the hood. The car would not even begin to labor even at 95 mph! Torque is even more impressive: 420 pounds-feet at 3,800 revolutions per minute. 
A friend of mine owns an SL600, what he calls, his �prized piece�. He maneuvered around all sorts of people who seemed to be at a standstill. They weren't, of course, but the SL just was so swift around them. 
He, in no way, once screeched the tires, though. You see, the SL600 has standard traction control functioning both the brakes and throttle automatically to help keep tires from slipping. An illuminated symbol in the instrument cluster lets you know it has betrothed and all too briefly, before you can react, it has turned itself off again, the urgent situation is over, and you're back to driving the car yourself. 
Get yourself in an understeer or oversteer condition and the car comes back to help with Mercedes' Electronic Stability Program, also standard on the SL600. This professional technology can sense that a car may be soon going out of control -- even sooner than the driver gets that uneasy feeling. ESP (catchy name, huh?) automatically applies the brake, as considered necessary, to just one wheel to correct the situation. 
Did I mention the SL600 windshield wipers work by rain sensor and robotically adjust their speed? How about the automatic roll bar that arranges in one-third of a second if sensors notice the car is beginning to roll over? 
There also are two front and two side air bags, a front seat occupancy sensor that automatically disables the front passenger air bag if no one is sitting there, and front seatbacks so strong that the top fasten for the shoulder belts are built right into them, not into the car body. 
I could go on, but you get the idea about this SL600. It's a special car with countless extraordinary features. 
OK, I'll add one more -- and only because it's hard to overlook, even if you're just walking by the car. For an extra $3,500, an SL can be fitted with a Panorama roof, a full tinted glass top that makes available a safe, yet fresh ride in any weather. 
New for 1997, the Panorama roof is detachable -- but you need two people to do it -- and has a black cloth shade that can enlarge inside the car, under the glass, if you want some privacy. The glass roof is darkly tinted, so you don't feel as if you're riding in a bubble, but you do get a superior sense of the outdoors and sky than you do from a simple sunroof since superfluous light streams in from the entire roof area. And since the Panorama roof does not fold up in any way, there are no gears or levers blocking your view. 
Mercedes says the glass is especially designed to reflect heat, so riders shouldn't get hot in the sun. And the Panorama roof can be put in on SLs dating back as far as the 1992 model year. 
This glass roof sits in the same grooves as those used by the SL's automatic soft-top and standard aluminum hardtop. Yes, this car, with the elective glass roof, actually has three different tops. The soft top, as in other convertibles, folds down and is stored behind the passenger area for true open-air driving. With the soft top down, however, you also can put on the glass roof, if you like, or the standard aluminum hardtop. Neither the glass roof nor the hardtops fold up, so they cannot be stored in the SL but must be left behind in the garage when not in use. 
Now, what other car has all this? Barely any. No wonder the Mercedes owners get respect on the road � for they are truly � the lucky few.
Just 684 SL600s were sold in the United States last year, and manufacture remains limited.


Other Pros are:
Front and side air bags; power windows, mirrors and door locks; remote keyless entry; seat heaters; automatic rearview mirror; cellular phone; cruise control; anti-lock brakes; traction control; electronic stability program; Bose sound system; six-CD changer; air conditioner with pollen and dust filter.
