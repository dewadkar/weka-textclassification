            Owning a pre-owned 95 Chevy Cavalier, 4-door, has proven to not only be an adventure, but be a lot of fun.  Getting this car as my first, i think its great.  My parents got it at a great price and it had great options.  But, then came the problems, aside from needing a new altinator and shocks, this car gets the worst mileage i have ever seen.  Having to fill up the tank every week not only puts a strain on my miniscule income but is tedious.  I was told that the &quot;short hauls&quot; are what kill the mileage, so i would reccoment this car for those who travel a good distance on a daily basis.  Overall its a fun car, small in size, and speedy.<br><br>
