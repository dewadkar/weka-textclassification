            When my Saturn was starting to head down into the deep abyss of financially ruining me and spending more time in the garage than in my parking space, I decided to look towards a new car. Having suffered at the hands of mean Miami SUV drivers I decided not to get another little car and join the ranks of the high riders.

At first I didn't even look at Jeep though my boyfriend does drive a Wrangler and we are happy with it. I test drove the Isuzu Rodeo which had a lot of roll and did not steer nicely - I felt it was over priced for what I was getting. Lured in by the hype of the Xterra I was greatly disappointed as the seats were uncomfortable and the interior space was not as large as I heard.

When I was convinced to test drive the Cherokee Sport I was pleasantly surprised, it handled like a car which was a big concern for me - I didn't want an SUV that I had to struggle with to drive. The ride was smooth and I was amazed by how much of the outside noise was kept at bay when the windows were closes. After battling and haggling I finally drove my Patriot Blue Cherokee Sport home and have loved driving it ever since. The seats are comfy and  I have so much room now that when I go to second hand stores or garage sales I know I can by something bog without a second though. So far the gas mileage has been good and the A/c works like a charm.
I love the free and rugged independence the Jeep has given me plus the feeling that I won't be bossed around anymore by other SUV's.

I like the feel of having a real SUV, I found many of the others to be more sexy than having a true performance build. I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a functional but enjoyable SUV that is affordable but a blast to drive. Since I am young and active it is also a comfort to know that what ever my future may bring - whether moving, biking, road trips this SUV will definitely be able to handle it.

Look at this vehicle and it will not let you down - if it had a voice it would say &quot;What can we do today?&quot; or &quot;You thought that was tough let's try something else.&quot;

The only person I would not recommend this Jeep to would be someone who is looking for the image of an SUV over what it can do.
