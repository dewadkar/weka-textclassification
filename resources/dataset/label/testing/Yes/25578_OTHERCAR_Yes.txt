            After college I decided to venture into buying my first luxury car and, thus, a BMW Z3
was my choice.  I now own a black BMW Z3 with tan interior and tan top.  If you have
never owned a 2 seated car before it will surely take some getting used to.  After that
awkwardness wears off, you will love this car.  I have never had 1 minutes problem out of
it that required much maintenance to fix.  The only minor problems I have had with it are: 
The key will sometimes require a bit of force to turn (almost like it is caught on
something) and during cold weather the &quot;check engine&quot; light will sporadically go on and
off though nothing is wrong with the engine.  Those are my only problems thus far.  The
smoothness of this car is amazing as well.  Even at 75 miles per hour, is feels VERY sooth
on the road.  The wind noise is minimal with the top down at normal speed.  One oddity of
this car is that of wind noise when the top is down.  As with most convertibles you can
just roll up the window to stop air from entering the cabin.  Not with the Z3, you get less
wind with the windows rolled down than with them rolled up (all of this with the top
down of course).  I don't really have anything bad to say about this car except that it is
small, other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this purchase.<br><br>
