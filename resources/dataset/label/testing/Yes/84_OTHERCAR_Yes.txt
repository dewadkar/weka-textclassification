            Ready? Hear what an experienced Miata driver loves and hates. 

<b>LOVES:</b> Nothing beats a sunny day with the wind in your hair. But that's a given. What's great about the Miata above other convertibles? 

STYLE: The look of the Miata is upscale and sporty with a lower price tag than you may see on other comparable sportscars. 

HANDLING: When I first researched the Miata, it was compared with the DelSol and bet it hands down. The author of the article (from an accredited magazine) said that the Miata is a &quot;roadster&quot; and it hugs the curves and &quot;sticks to the road&quot;. Under normal driving conditions (no slick roads), the car handles like a dream.

FEATURES: The convertible top is easy to take down, it just takes a few seconds. For winter, you can get a hard top which makes it look even nicer. Last year I saw a hard-top Miata in a parking lot and said &quot;ooh, I like THAT car!&quot; not even realizing it was a Miata, strangely enough. It gives it another look. 

ON THE LIGHTER SIDE: You will fit in many parking spaces! When they say you can't, 9 times out of 10 you will prove them wrong! If you decide to drive a Miata, get ready to receive many, many compliments &quot;I love your car&quot; from friends, relatives and strangers. I have heard this so many times I can't even count. You will get a nice tan driving this car. It's true! 

I ADORE MY MIATA: I've leased two Miatas consecutively and I just ordered a third. Which means that by the time I'm done, I will have gotten Miatas 9 years in a row and I continue to love them. 

<b>ON THE DOWN SIDE:</b> The only thing that's bothered me personally is that getting out is a bit awkward since the car is so small and so low to the ground. At first your friends will say &quot;Wow, can I ride with you?&quot; and then after a year or two they will say &quot;Your car is so uncomfortable&quot; when prying themselves out of it. Nevertheless I would highly recommend this car to anyone under 6' 2&quot; - my partner is 6' 5&quot; and does ride with me with knees folded up a bit, although as I say, I did begin receiving complaints after about 2 1/2 years. 

NOT THE QUIETEST: Depending upon your preferences, those wanting a quiet ride might be bothered by the sounds of the soft top in the wind. 

TINY TRUNK: Don't expect your suitcase to fit in the trunk. 

THE ELEMENTS: This car isn't the greatest in the rain. I slide a bit whereas my partner doesn't when driving a more typical, larger car under the same driving conditions. If you hit a little puddle, your car may bounce around just a bit. A few times I couldn't get out of my completely shovelled driveway since the car was too light to grip.

BUT STILL... The feeling of freedom you get, the fun you'll have driving it and the cool style of the Miata far, far outweigh the drawbacks. Each time my lease is up, I look around at all the convertibles available and I always wind up getting another Miata. That says something.<br><br>
