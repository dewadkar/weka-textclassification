            I purchased my 2001 bull in May of 2001 using the plethora of incentives then available.  Mine is a Graphite Blue SES with Traction control, Heated mirrors, 6-CD MACH audio system, 5-pass. seating, Power Moon Roof, and base Vulcan engine.

The color can bug me, a 28 year-old male.  It can look purple under many light conditions and I hate purple.  Too bad it didn't look that way at the dealership!  Oh well, this is such a minor issue anyway.

The car is cheaper than many smaller offerings on the market with all of the constant incentives.  You definitely get more than you pay for in a Taurus.  My previous Taurus was a 1995 I traded in with 130,000 miles.  It had only minimal problems (speedometer, oil pan gasket and water pump) with the latter waiting until around 120k.

I already have nearly 12,000 on this auto.  It is relatively comfortable on long trips.  Mind you it is no luxury model but it feels as nice as a Camry and almost as good as an Avalon.  The trunk space is cavernous.  2 FULL size suitcases, 2 garment bags, 1 toiletry bag and many Christmas gift bags fit with the seats in the normal position.  Seats down, you can put small sheets of building materials (36x60 concrete board, for example) in there with the trunk closed.  The passenger space is quite nice.  Four large adults can fit very comfortably and five normal adults can ride with no complaints.  It is also very easy to install child safety seats in this car.

I don't notice any transmission strain whatsoever towing my small sailboat to the lake.  The engine/tranny combo work nicely together for no-questions-asked acceleration, even up hills.  Again, this is no 'Vette but "it isn't your father's Oldsmobile" either!  The down side of this is a lack of urban gas mileage.  I get an average of 21mpg commuting.  But once it is on the Interstate, mountain or coastal, it always tops 30mpg - HONEST!

I enjoy the robust MACH audio system.  Especially with the choice to enjoy CDs, radio or tape!  And I also realized last week in the snow how well the Traction control works.  You barely have to know how to drive in inclement weather with this system on!

My only real beefs are that I can't control the compressor with a separate A/C switch like the Camry has (had?).  It would be nice to turn off the A/C for foot/face vents or to turn it on for the foot only vent so the windows wouldn't fog up so easily.  Oh well, this is almost as whiny as the color issue and the miscellaneous groans the car makes.

I had to get the Oil pan replaced at 9,000 miles.  This is why I state possible quality issues.  I don't like a car leaking oil at any mileage, especially this low.  Lets hope it is only a fluke!
