            In 1999, Jaguar re-entered the compact class with the S-Type, a dead ringer from the front for the 3.4. The S-Type is a much better car than the 3.4 was, even when it was new. Powered by either a 3.0-liter DOHC V-6 or a 4.0-liter DOHC V-8, the S-Type has more power than the older cars, it puts that power to the road through a better five-speed automatic transmission, and the wood veneer and leather don't show signs of aging yet. 

The 4.0-liter V-8, which is the same engine in the XK8 sports car and XJ8 sedans. With 281 horsepower available, this engine is smooth and powerful. In a car like the S-Type it moves you well through any situations, and has enough oomph to get you out of trouble if those situations get testy. I like the gearbox, too, although the gating was sometimes annoying. This is especially evident at night, because the maze isn't lighted and you rub off the corners trying to find which direction the lever goes. 

What has impressed me most about every S-Type I have seen is its smoothness. Acceleration isn't jerky, even when you mash your foot to the floor. Handling is Jaguar excellent, yet it isn't rock-hard like some sport sedans. The S-Type has a compliant suspension that will accommodate itself to anything the driver wants to do. 

Seating is leather-upholstered, of course. The front buckets offer decent side support, while there is room for three adults in the back. I wouldn't want to be in the center of the seat on a long ride, though. 

Some of the 3.4's styling was lost in the modernization. In order to create a larger trunk, the &quot;pinched in&quot; tail of the 3.4 was widened. The S-Type's trunk now will carry at least two golf bags or enough luggage for a decent trip. The smooth sides of the 3.4 also went the way of fluting and (probably) better door protection, but I preferred the simpler sides. Part of this is personal, part is because I've never really been a fan of sculpted door panels. 

The S-Type also has a proximity sensor in the rear bumpers. As you approach an object behind you, the sensor emits a beep. The closer you get, the higher the frequency of the beep, until it becomes a solid tone. This is a definite safety advantage.
