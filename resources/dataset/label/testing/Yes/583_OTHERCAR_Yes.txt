            The general Vandura body fit-and-finish seems to be close to the best that GM can achieve reasonably.  The unit I own already has 91,000 miles but is still quiet and reasonably wind-noise free.  

All body hardware is in good shape and operational except for the passenger electric door lock, a minor problem.

I do see wear on some of the steering/suspension areas, control arm bushings, Etc., but these again are relatively minor problems easily resolved.

The interior has remained near factory perfect, and with occasional spot-cleaning and general (loving) care, is still worthy of carrying my best friends anywhere!

Regarding the tire size assigned to this chassis, I have often wondered if they are a little on the "light-duty" side, although I have never had a structural tire problem I never liked the "squashed" look they have, even with 32 pounds of air.
