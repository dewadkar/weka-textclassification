            I swore up and down that I would never buy an SUV but when my old Volvo's upkeep became too expensive and the forecast for winter looked snowy, I bit the bullet and went shopping for a used one.  After a lot of research, I narrowed my choices to the Pathfinder and Jeep Cherokee.  More research revealed the Cherokee to have a dismal record for repairs and customer satisfaction and the Pathfinder to have just the opposite.

My '97 Pathfinder was actually purchased sight-unseen because my brother works at a large auto auction.  The first time I saw it, I was thrilled!  They are great-looking vehicles, not boxy or oversized.  And the interior must have been designed by a woman (sorry, guys) because everything is simple, logical and easy to use.  The heat and A/C are wonderful, couldn't get any hotter or colder.

I love the rear compartment - being able to open just the glass is convenient and it's big enough to hold my car care supplies, blankets, folding chair, etc. and still put in 20 bags of groceries.  The rear hatch opens gently and slowly so you can easily handle it with one hand.  Combined with the keyless entry system, it makes stowing 2 handfuls of shopping bags a breeze when you're alone.

The Pathfinder handles more like a car than a truck.  It has a small turning radius, is easy to park and the ride feels and sounds very car-like.  The sound system is wonderful.  The driver's seat has good lumbar support and is quite comfortable.  I am 5'-11" tall and have no trouble with headroom or with entering and exiting the vehicle.  Actually, I can just swing my legs out and they are on the ground - the perfect height - no "climbing" required!
 
It hasn't snowed and I haven't had the opportunity to go 4-wheeling yet, so I can't give an opinion as the to 4-wheel drive - but I am looking forward to using it.  My only disappointment is the size of the gas tank (one would expect it to be larger) and the low gas mileage, but I was warned that the mileage would suck and it's actually not much worse than the Volvo's!
