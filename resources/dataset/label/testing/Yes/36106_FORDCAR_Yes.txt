            One thing is clear: Ford Focus is the best small car from any manufacturer, and especially from an American auto maker.  Its ride comfort, handling and general design are top-notch even compared to bigger, more expensive models.

I had to wait about 2 months to get my Focus ZTS sedan in July.  This car is very popular, so be prepared to wait your turn.  At around $16,000, the European-developed, American-manufactured small sedan costs about the same as a Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sentra, and much less than a VW Jetta, but having driven all these other cars as well, I can tell you that the Focus is actually a better car.

First on the &quot;must love&quot; list is the ride comfort, which is suprisingly un-small-car-like.  The suspension handles road bumps very well, giving you full control over the road surface.  Even with a full load the ride is smooth and assuring.  The Focus really feels like an Acura or Lexus.

The Focus also handles very nimbly, like its Japanese competitors.  What I like the most is how confidently it handles turns, even sharp ones like a U-turn.  The 130-hp engine and automatic transmission deliver more than adequate performance even when climbing small hills and cruising between 55 and 85 mph on the highway.  The engine is quiet and stable.  The brakes make you feel safe.

The Focus' styling is not breakthrough but on the attractive side.  The car is well built with few defects.  The interior is roomy compared to other cars in its class (&quot;small&quot; or &quot;compact&quot;), and getting in and out of the car should be easy for people of all ages and sizes.  The rear seats are particularly well laid out and comfortable.  Finally, the trunk is large.

Dual air bags are standard while side ones are an option.  I read somewhere that the government has crash-tested the Focus and given it good scores.  The car feels reliable and solid.

Bottom line:  The Focus is a well-engineered, well-built car from a manufacturer that's improving its quality and reliability record.  It does not feel like a small car at all.  It even rides better than most mid-sized cars.  I really love this car.
