              I believe that Chevy S-10 is a good truck for someone that wants just a regular nice pick-up. They aren't too good in the winter though.With rear wheel drive it makes them very easy to wreck. So if you were to get an S-10 I would suggest the 4 wheel drive model for a much better and safer ride in the winter time. I have recently seen these new models of the S-10 that have a oversized tires and a lift kit already custom done from the factory. I think that if you are looking for a nice truck not too big but not too small then those would be a good pick. So over all if I were to buy a regular S-10 I would buy a 4-wheel drive model. It can save you money and ensure your safety!<br><br>
