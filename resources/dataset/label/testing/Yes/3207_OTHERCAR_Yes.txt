                 Recently, I found myself in the market for a new digital camera. I had the Sony DSC-S50, a 2.1mega-pixel camera which was stolen from me while on vacation. Being comfortable with the Sony product, I knew that I would more than likely stay with Sony. I did also look at the Nikon Coolpix 995 and the Minolta Diamage 304.
     I wanted a camera that was easy to use not just for me, but for anyone who picked it up. I have had the camera 2 weeks and I love it. I was taking pictures with it 5 minutes after I took it out of the box.
     My biggest complaint about the camera is the fact that there is no cover for the LCD. I solved this problem by using a screen protector from my PDA. My only other complaint is the fact that Sony does not include a carrying case with the camera One would think that when you spend nearly $1000 for a camera, the least that they could do is include a case for it.
     I took some of the pictures that I took with my old camera and compared them to pictures taken with the DSC-S85. The difference is amazing. The only limitation in you picture quality will be your printer.
    Some people have complained about the long lag time between pressing the shutter button and the camera actually taking a picture. This can be solved by pressing the shutter button half-way down before you take the picture. This allows the camera to o its fine focus. My old Sony told you this in the manual. I don't recall seeing this in the manual for the DSC-S85.
