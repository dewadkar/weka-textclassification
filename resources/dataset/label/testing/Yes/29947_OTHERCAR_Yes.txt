            I drive a 94 dodge Caravan, I bought her used, as a lease vehicular she was treated bad, I found old maitinace record for her on the net and she was treated quite badly, oil changes at 6000 miles and other fun fact like that... well I bought her with 50000 miles she now has 150000 miles and i have never had a single problem with her, i keep up on maitaince and keep her clear. This has been the BEST vehicular I have ever owned, it was more reliable than my Nissan pickup that I owned before my baby now. Its true, i was a teen ager when i bought this van and its not for every one. I love to drive it because its practical, fun and acctualy has quite a bit of spunk to her. I pull a 2200 lbs boat with her in the summer time with ease. Who should buy one of these? College students for sure! this babd boy is my college cargo bus, making the trip of 600 miles from school to home and vise versa, fully loaded pulling a uhaul with easy.

ok to be honest i had one problem with her. I had leaking head gasgets at 14000 miles. well she still made the 600 mile trip home at the normal speeds and under a heavy load. No problem, i just keep the resivour full. and then when i got home I replaced the head gasgets my self. while i was in there i check all engine maiting surfaces with a persion strigh edge. well i could not even fit a feeller gauge of .0003 in between the striagh edge and the block or heads.

This is by far the supior minivan with out a doubt, oh and one more thing, I have the T series Transmission that so many people complain about. never had a problem with it!<br><br>
