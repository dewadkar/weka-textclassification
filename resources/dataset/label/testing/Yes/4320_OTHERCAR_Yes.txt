            What is not to like about this car?? I have gone everywhere in this thing and it is great. Mine is a straight drive, champagne beige, brownish tan interior. It was a used lease vehicle and I fell in love with it. What made it worse is the dealer let me drive it for the weekend. Well, how do you give it back after that???? I was like a kid in a candy store after that. I just recently gave my interior a carpet bath and it was so exciting to see the seats and carpet look like new after numerous soda spilled by my hubby and nieces and nephew.

I change the oil pretty regularly-even though if you get your oil changed at the dealer, they have a special oil filter that you can't get anywhere else that has double filtering so you can actually last to 5000 miles instead. Which reminds me, I need to get it changed. 

I fell in love with one from two people I know has them and they let me ride and drive theirs and I was saying that I would get that kind of car if I ever got a new one. Well when my poor old Dodge broke down complete with black smoke and everything, that was the first place I went. 

I think anyone who wants a dependable car, with no hassles, GREAT GREAT gas mileage, this is the car. It sort of sporty looking for a sedan and four doors, hardly any worries of repair, and it's just a nice overall car for someone who really wants dependable. Which is how my father taught me to be so I guess the car fits. I haven't found one person who has had a bad word from the many of friends who own them, there isn't anything to complain about. The car starts, it goes farther then point A and point B, better then Timex and Samsonite. So hey, try it out, don't believe me ask around.<br><br>
