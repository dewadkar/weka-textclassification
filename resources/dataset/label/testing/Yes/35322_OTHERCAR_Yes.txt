            To be honest I bought a small truck, because at the time (1996) I could not afford a big truck.  What I didn't know is that I was getting a small truck with a big heart.  I have loaded that truck down with horse feed, hay, equipment, building supplies....  I once pulled two horses, but that little V-6 didn't miss a beat.  I have had to do minimum maintenance to the vehicle.  It gets great MPG, doesn't leak fluids.  The down-sides:  small rear bunk seats (not made for an adult); light rear-end (have gotten it stuck in the mud); and not made for large people.  The V-6 had no problems merging on the highway.  Standard transmission (after 4 years of use) still shifts great.  Anyone wanting to do light hauling or doesn't need to haul every weekend and still wants great mileage and low cost should look at the Mazda before any other small truck.<br><br>
