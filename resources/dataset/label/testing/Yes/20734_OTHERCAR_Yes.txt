            When my son turned 16 I was out of a car, and i needed one fast.  Luckly, while shopping at my local chevy dealer i discovered the Blazer.  From the first time I saw it I knew i had to have one.  My blazer is a 1998 red and white edition, it has never broken down on me or given me anyprobles at all.  I bought mine for about 25,000 dollars which i thought was a steal for the comfort and elegance you get from riding in my special red and white Blazer.  My car came with a cd player, ac, and all the comforts you would want in an SUV.  It is 4 wheel drive and is very capible of crusing any tarrain.  This is my favorite car of all time, i have many a car in my day and this is the most relaible and the most dependable car you can find on the market.  If you buy this car you will not be sorry, it has comfortable seats and makes you want to never stop driving. I love my Blazer!<br><br>
