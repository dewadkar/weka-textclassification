            One of the best and toughest cars I have ever owned was my 2003 Beetle GL TDI.  Unfortunately I rolled it and they totaled it but the steel cell construction and all the steel reinforcment really paid off.   I was sick when I realized I was on my top in the middle of the road but I thanked the good Lord and the people who made the Beetle for my not getting a scratch let alone not getting killed.  That Beetle hit a curb, busted off a steel light post and ended upside down and really stood up well.  Seat Belts and airbags really do work.  The sheriff who investigated said "It is a good thing that you weren't in a Dodge Neon, you would be in the hospital right now"  The Beetle was cracked and the top bent down a little but I have seen a lot worse.  I have always said that the Germans build a good, sturdy car and now I KNOW they do.

The 2003 Beetle comes in two trim levels.  The GL and the GLS.  Basic means a lot different thing than it did 10 years ago.  The GL comes with power windows, power door locks, power heated mirrors, remote keyless entry  and AM/FM cassette.  The GL comes with cloth seats but are available heated.  The Gls adds a CD radio, sunroof and alloy wheels.  Plus you can get the upgraded stereo system and the leather package.

My 2003 Beetle TDI was a GL model but it had the cold weather package which includes heated seats and heated windshield washers.  It was Platinum Gray with black cloth seats and the 5 speed manual tranny.  I loved it and never got under 45 miles per gallon and on one trip to Nebraska (500 miles round trip) I got 49,64 miles per gallon.  I'm sure I would have gotten 46-47 in town and 52 or so on the road if I had ever gotten it broken in.  It only had 5700 miles on it when I rolled it.

The 2003 Beetle TDI come with  a 1.9 liter, four cylinder  turbo diesel that produces a whopping 90 horsepower but  like all Diesels whether they are in a Beetle or a Kenworth, the secret is developing high torque at low RPM.  The TDI develops its maximum torque at about 1900 RPM.  It is a pretty peppy little outfit and I guarantee it will surprise a lot of folks.  I has turbo lag like most diesels but if you keep your RPMs at 2000 or a little above you won't even notice it.  It doesn't have any problems merging with traffic or keeping up with the flow.  We went up to Breckenridge one weekend and the only time I got out of fifth gear is to slow down for a wreck and of course in town.  It climbed right up those 7% grades no problem.  The key is to keep the RPM in the torque range.  There are after market chips and exhaust systems that will jump the TDI to about 150 HP and are supposed to improve gas mileage too.  I never got a chance to do anything to mine.  I liked it just the way it was.

Volkwagen has done a good job on safety and the Beetle has a lot of safety equipment.  Front and rear crush zones, anti-intrusion side door beams and the previously mentioned steel cell construction.  Plus they have daytime running lights, ignition disablement and anti-theft alarms
The front and side airbags are standard equipment too.

You can get the Beetle TDI with an automatic (four speed) but I doubt very seriously if you will ever see one on a lot unless you special order it.  Now for 2004 they are increasing the horsepower to 100 and offering a SIX speed auto in the TDI Beetle.  That my be a pretty sweet combination but I haven't found one yet.

As fas as handling and comfort go, the Beetle TDI corners and handles real well.  The steering is quick and positive and the 2003 Beetle comes with fat 16" tires so it hangs right in there on the corners and does better than you might think in the snow and mud.  One day at work I drove right buy a guy in a 4x4 Ford that had to get out and lock in his hubs.

The Beetle TDI goes pretty good but when it comes to WHOA power it does really good.  It has 4 wheel disc brakes and 4 wheel ABS.  They are very smooth and have no fade that I ever observed but I never really had to panic stop.  When the brakes get worn down there is a light that shows up on the dash as well as if there is a problem with the ABS system.

The seats are very comfortable and even on a long trip they are quite comfortable.  There is a lot of leg room in the front seats.  the back seat is bearable for an average sized adult for a short trip.  Te front seats have adjustable lumbar support and height adjustment.  As far as cargo capacity, there isn't much unless you fold down the back seat.  This is fairly easy to do and makes a lot of room.  I hauled my 6 hp Troy-Bilt tiller in the back of mine with the seats down and the hatch held closed with bungee cords.

The stereo in the GL has a cassette and six speakers.  It is quite adequate.  When I bought mine they had a promotion with Apple that gave me a 15GB IPod that will store 67 hours of music and is used by plugging into a power outlet and inserting a cassette connection.  Pretty neat.  The GLS has a CD player and you can get the upgraded Monsoon stereo system.  

VW offers more color choices than most any manufacturer.  You can get your Beetle in Chartreuse, Bright Yellow, Orange, Black, Red, White, Silver, Gray, and a couple different Blues.  I have been very impressed with the build quality with both of my Beetles.  I work construction and travel some pretty rough roads so if anything was going to rattle I probably would have found it by now.

If you need an economical commuter car that is also fun to drive and good looking, check out a TDI Beetle.  You will probably have to get a new one because they just don't show up on lots.  When I rolled mine I checked with 8 different VW dealers along the front range and several Toyota and Honda dealers and didn't find one. NEW or USED.
