            Listen up this is not a joke...My family bought a brand new Lincoln Navigator last september.  For the first half year I must admit that I enjoyed this suv very much.  But the most horrific incident happened two weeks ago when I drove to Santa Anita Hills.  I was on a camping trip, so I drove my navigator through some steep roads on a mountain.  There was this part of the upward road that dips down, which I didn't notice.  I was driving somewhat faster than the limit, and when I passed through the dip, the front end of car made a really tough bounce.  When I turned the wheels to save the car, it slided and turned over to the right side.  The mirrors hit the side of few trees, and broke off.  I was not severely hurt.  But I should remember this forever.<br><br>
