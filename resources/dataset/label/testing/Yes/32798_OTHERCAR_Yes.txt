            We got our GMC Suburban in 1995.  I wasn't sure I wanted a car this big but I hated the custom van (even thought it had a TV in it!) that my husband bought to pull our camper with.  Instead I found that it was easy to drive.  

We had put three rear ends into the custom van because pulling the trailer burned them up for some reason.  When the third rear-end went in the custom van, my husband had gone down to Lake Cumberland with his family a few days early and we were supposed to join them as soon as soccer and dance camps were finished.  Instead, my husband called and said wait.  He brought the van back home to the dealer who sold it to us.  Even though the van was outfitted and rated for the trailer, it was not a good trailer vehicle.  The dealer impressed us by taking the van back, giving us a good deal on the Suburban (which had just come in that day and still had the packing on it!), and by refusing to sell the van to another customer who wanted to pull a trailer.  We drove the new Suburban to the Lake and a couple of days later, I took it on a road trip to Boy Scout camp to pick up our son and bring him to our family vacation.  (Not a restful vacation for me so far, was it?)  I was impressed with the vehicle and I thoroughly loved it by the time I got back to camp!

The interior of our Suburban is leather.  My husband raved about leather but I thought it would be uncomfortable -- like vinyl.  But it is nothing like vinyl!  It's softer.  It is a little cold in the winter but warms up pretty quickly.  It is easier to clean than cloth!  If only the carpet cleaned as easily as the seats!  The interior is roomy too.  We have now stored our camper near the lake we visit every other weekend in the summertime so we pack large boxes and coolers with very little difficulty.  Both back seat can be folded down for extra room.  

The only problem I have had driving the car, is the large side mirrors that have been bumped while backing out of the garage and I broke the mirror.  The mirrors fold in and out but I guess I caught it just right while backing.  Still the mirrors make it easy to see while pulling the trailer and I like them while driving.

Our lease is up in July.  My husband wants to get a new Suburban but this one is not used up!  We have done the maintenance required and have had no major repairs to date.  (We have had some belts, hoses and wires that have needed to be replaced.)  The only reason he might convince me on is the 4-wheel drive feature.  Ours doesn't have it and there have been a few times (especially this winter!) when it would have been really nice to slip into 4-wheel drive.  Of course, he tells me the car won't get quite as good gas mileage (not good already!) in 4-wheel drive.  (Personally, I'd like to find a good, used Suburban that is only a couple of years old and that has been cared for like we care for ours!)

I highly recommend this vehicle.  It is comfortable and can double as a hard working truck (with protection of the interior).  If you are in the market for a SUV, you can't go wrong with a GMC Suburban!<br><br>
