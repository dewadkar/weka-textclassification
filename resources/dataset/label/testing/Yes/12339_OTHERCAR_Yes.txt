            I had the opportunity to go on a test drive with a friend who was looking at purchasing a 2000 Eclipse.  I have always loved Eclipses and still do.  I would buy this car could I afford it.  There are some really cool things about-like its looks.  What I didn't like is that there is absolutely no room in the backseat.  I've been in plenty of little cars that had room.  I am 5'2&quot;, 100lbs.  I'm short and skinny.  I was sitting in the backseat, passenger side.  My head was about a 1/2 inch away from the back glass.  If I would have leaned back any, my head would have touched.  I recommend this car to people who love sports cars and don't chauffer people around.  If you have any tall friends who may be riding in the backseat-they will have no room.  In other words, anybody who usually has big groups of people in their car, should not buy this. <br><br>
