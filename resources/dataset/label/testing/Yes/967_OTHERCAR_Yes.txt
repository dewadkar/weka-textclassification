            I bought the RDC-4200 because it had all the features I wanted for the right price. However, this is no simple camera.

The features that attracted me to this camera were 1280x960 resolution, 3x optical zoom, 6x digital zoom, 190 degree rotating lens, flash, self timer, color LCD monitor, and support for 4mb, 8mb, and 16mb SmartMedia cards.

The image size can be easily switched between 1280x960 and 640x480. The higher resolution is better for printing your photos, but the lower resolution will save memory. For example, on a 4mb SmartMedia card you can store 12 high resolution pictures or 48 low resolution pictures.

The zoom feature allows you to get a close-up picture without changing your position. When the camera is zoomed to its highest optical setting, you can use the digital zoom to further enhance the zoom effect.

The rotating lens lets you easily select an angle for shooting. You can even turn the lens all the way around and take a picture of yourself.

The flash, of course, is needed for taking pictures indoors. This is not the best quality flash. Pictures taken with the flash tend to have a blue tint, but with the included Photo Studio software you can easily adjust the tones.

The 10 second self-timer allows you to press the release button then quickly get into position for that perfect family portrait.

The color LCD monitor is about 1.75 inches diagonal. I've had no problem viewing it in sunlight.

SmartMedia cards are your reusable digital film. The camera comes with one 4mb card, but it also supports 8mb and 16mb cards. 

The camera has some more advanced features including exposure compensation and white balance. I would suggest experimenting with these settings to understand their effect.

Pictures are transferred to your PC using the serial port. This method is a little slow but unless you take a lot of pictures every day, I don't think it's much of an issue.

The camera uses (actually EATS) 4 AA batteries. I highly recommend investing in a battery recharger and NiMH rechargeable batteries.

I've had this camera for five months now, and I've taken over 500 pictures including birthdays and a wedding.
