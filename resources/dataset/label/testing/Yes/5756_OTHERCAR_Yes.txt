            I have a 96 Tracer 4dr sedan, it is a very nice car for it's category. It impressed me because I never liked the looks of the sedan, it has a nice escort front end, then a choppy rear end.     It rides very smoothly and has a huge trunk. The 1.9 liter motor is underpowered and when it's cold the 4 speed auto tranny shifts a little rough and jerky, but its smooth when it warms up. Could get better fuel mileage.    The interior is set up very nicely. The seats are firm but comfy and easy on your back. The dash is nice, why they give you a tach is beyond me. I would like the radio moved up, you have to reach to get to it.     The exterior is ok, I prefer the Escort headlights and grill...much nicer than the ugly Mercury glass. With Mercury trim, it doesn't even look like an Escort.     Overall, this is a great car and definitely worth the money. Those things I mentioned above are not major problems, most other cars have a huge lists of problems/uglys about them. Don't count out the Tracer when your looking for a good used car.<br><br>
