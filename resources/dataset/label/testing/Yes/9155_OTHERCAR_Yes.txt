            I purchased this car from a roommate of mine when her father bought her a new car. Her father had had the car put together from 2 Mazda 323's that had been in accidents, and between the two there were parts enough to build one. I previously owned an '87 Chevy Nova sedan, and although I was wary of owning a hatchback, I was pleasantly surprised with my new car. 
I was very pleased with the '91 Mazda 323, I bought it for $1200 a couple years ago, and it was nearly always a good and reliable car. The hatchback and fold down rear seat allowed the car to haul things as large as a loveseat without any problems. It had good pick-up, and got fantastic gas mileage. The car had 100,000 miles on it when I bought it, and other that usual maintanence (oil changes, etc...) it was a wonderful vehicle. 
I would highly recommend getting this car if you need an inexpensive workhorse of a car. The only drawbacks I found were as follows: It's hard to work on the engine, because it's so compact, so if you're planning on doing some of the maintanence yourself, it's a tight squeeze. Unless you basically have a mechanic's shop in your garage, I wouldn't suggest trying to work on this car yourself. On rainy days, I occasionally needed to put some iso-heat in the gas tank to get the car started, so if you live in a wet rainy climate, you may want to consider that. Mazda did a recall on part of the automatic seatbelt, so if you buy this car used, you may want to check to see if the owner at the time of the recall had that part fixed. The only other thing is that this model car has the reputation of having a problem with static electricity build up in the driver's side door and shock you as you get out. I personally never had this problem, but the girl that owned it before me did. She said if you take it to a Mazda dealership, they will be willing to put a ground plate of some sort in, and that takes care of that. 
Overall, I definitely recommend this car, the good outweighed the bad a hundred to one. <br><br>
