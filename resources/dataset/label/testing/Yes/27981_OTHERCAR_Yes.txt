            Had a 4+4 ford ranger 1988 with 138000 on it so it was about time for something new. Always liked the looks of the toyota . Got a add from a local dealer so I went down to check it out.Ended up buying a standard cab 4+4 model.4cyl. 5 speed. For a 4cyl. its peppy.   Has a nice ride for a small wheel base truck.the ranger had a little nicer ride.But like the toyota handling much better.Now I got the regular cab and it is small so if you are going to be driving people around you will need the extra cab for sure.  I always over load my trucks as I do with this one and it seems fine still able to brake good and handling is still fine with a heavy load.The sound system could be better, got the am fm cassette but it only has 2 speakers one in each door panel ,Seem to me I cant hear it very well ,but more speakers could be hooked up to the system it has fade control. I'm 6 foot 210lbs. and the driver seat fits me well.<br><br>
