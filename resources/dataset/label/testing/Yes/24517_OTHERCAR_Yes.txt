            NIKON COOLPIX 885 - A "Cocked-Diesel" Camera for Beginners...

Product Review by Mr. Peter P. Kim
Senior System Administrator, Oracle DBA, amateur photographer.

I never was big on photography until my girlfriend bought me a Canon ELPH LT for Christmas 2000.  It was my first camera and I started taking photos everywhere; anything and everything, until the film development became expensive.  I noticed the cool digital cameras, but they seemed too expensive for my taste.  That is why I waited until a big price drop before buying this...

THE GOOD.
After reading many of Howard Creech's reviews and others on different photography sites, I had narrowed it down to the Coolpix 885.  I disliked the swivel-lens of the 990 and 995.  The 5000 would have lead me to financial ruin.  The Coolpix 885 had exactly met my simple criteria: (1) 3+ megapixels, so I don't have worry about out-of-date technology like the Pentium 486 architecture; (2) one piece, small to fit comfortably in my hands; (3) easy to take and transfer pictures; (4) looks appealing; (5) takes short movies; (6) easy and quick review mode.

THE BAD.
It does has its faults as well.  These things bother me: (1) If you take pictures with red, the color will look strangely distorted. (2) The 12 other special modes are a bit confusing to effectively use sometimes. As a beginner, it was overwhelming at times. (3) No matter who's in the picture, everyone has red eye! Photoshop plugins are a great help! (4) Expect to buy lots of accessories because there are none packaged with the camera.

THE CRIES THAT FALL ON DEAF EARS.
I've heard other complaints of (1) slow startup times and (2) noisy zoom.  (3) battery life is a bit short, so I have a spare with me at all times. (4) no audio when in movie mode. (5) flash only works for a 6 foot distance. As a beginner, these kind of things can be overlooked, as it serves the basic functions.  Really, I didn't notice them since they didn't inhibit my picture taking fun.  When I become an intermediate photographer, I will expect these things to be eradicated when I buy my next digital camera.

It's a great camera for ebay stuff or even pictures of your friends.  There are many times I go out drinking and want to take dumb pictures.  Why should I waste APS film when I can dynamically take pictures on my Coolpix?  This bad boy is easy to use, while it helps me get a better understanding of digital photography with it's strong optics and technology.  It also prepares me for a more advanced camera in the future.

What you get with a Nikon Coolpix 885 purchase: 
the digital camera, 16 MB memory card, instruction manual, software (Nikon View, photo editing, etc), wrist strap, video cable, USB cable, and a lens cap.

I had to buy other peripherals to be happy:
64 MB memory card, carrying case, power adapter, and extra lithium ion battery.
