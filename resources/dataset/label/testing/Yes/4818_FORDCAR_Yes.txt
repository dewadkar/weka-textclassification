            We have a 1990 Ford Ranger that is used to the extremes.  Our regular delivery truck, a big Isusu, went on the blink, and we started using our Ford Ranger for deliveries.  We expected the Ranger to last only a short while for this big job, as we deliver very heavy appliances and huge furniture pieces.  It is serving us really well.  We deliver in town, but, we, also, deliver to the mountainous areas around our town.  When I say mountainous, I mean roads that are not roads, yet, to homes that don't need numbers. . .you just follow the directions, and look for the family dog, or the fancy rose bush by the side of the dirt path turn in.

The Ranger has not let us down.  It isn't fancy.  It is a manual drive, and can only seat 2 people comfortably.  It does have a window in the back that opens up to let some air in when the area is blazing hot.  We do have air conditioning, a radio, and that's about it as far as extras.
We have even been known to pull our 23 foot Marlin Boat with it for short distances. The gas mileage is great, and we haven't worried much about getting the old delivery truck back, since we discovered how well this Ranger transports our deliveries. If it had a lift gate, it would be really perfect for us!

One thing does bother me.  A man, in a hurry, flipped a U-turn behind our Ranger, and barely tapped the tail gate.  He was certain he'd done no damage, but, since I saw him do it, I got the insurance information, anyway.  (He wasn't happy to give it to me, as he was sure that the truck was just fine).  Then, I examined the truck.  The tailgate wouldn't open, anymore.  Now, for a delivery truck, that is pretty important!  I had it fixed (using his insurance).  The part that bothered me was that the new tail gate cost $1,000! I don't buy a lot of truck parts, but, I think that was a pretty hefty price for a tailgate, counting the labor and all.

We have had ten years of confidence with this Ranger, and expect to have many more.  We give it only standard maintenance, and it has never broken down on us.  With all the miles, wear and tear we put on it, I think this is a pretty darn good pick up.  I would recommend it to anyone!<br><br>
