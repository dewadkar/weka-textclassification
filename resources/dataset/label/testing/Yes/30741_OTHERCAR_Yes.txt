            Having wanted to purchase a digital camera for quite a while, but not having an unlimited budget to do so, my family decided upon the Olympus D-340R. It seemed like a perfect compromise between affordability and functionality. The display screen was a major plus in this model that others of its price range lack. Ease of use both in taking photographs and transferring the images to the PC has remained unrivaled in my experience with other digital models.
However, one pitfall I failed to anticipate was the basic design flaw found in the front slide mechanism. Essentially, the slider feature lends itself toward being broken by its very nature and appropriate use. In order to operate the camera, the front shutter is pushed open, much like in film cameras. However, due to the fragile nature of some of the electronic components, merely being opened can cause it to be easily broken.
I had a family member and a close friend, who upon my recommendation, purchased this model of camera. All three of us experienced that same difficulty with the slider.  With even careful use, the shutter broke and had to be replaced within a year of purchase. This is not covered in the warranty (which I think is ridiculous considering it is clearly a design flaw and not due to user error) and cost approximately $100 to repair at a local camera shop.
My main intent in purchasing a digital camera was that after purchase, I would not have to expend further money on film or developing. However with the cost of repair, the camera was no longer such an excellent value. While I was certainly aware that at some point the camera might indeed require repair, I did not anticipate the need arising so soon, and due to nothing more than normal use.
Overall my opinion of this camera is still quite high. I still recommend it as the most user-friendly and feature rich camera in it's price range, but I am careful to warn anyone considering it seriously to invest in an excellent camera case (which in my opinion should be provided by Olympus with purchase of the device) and to take extra special care to watch for trouble with the front slider mechanism.<br><br>
