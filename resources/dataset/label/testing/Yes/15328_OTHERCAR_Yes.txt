            I have a Mavica, a regular digital camera and several traditional 35mm cameras.  I like the Mavica best.

Like everyone, I knew that using a regular floppy disk would be more convenient.  I never knew HOW convenient it would be.

First of all, its really CHEAP.  There are lots and lots of floppy disks lying around offices, homes and other places.  You pay no cost for film and no cost for developing.  After about 1000-2000 shots, you have paid for your Mavica.  Floppies are maybe 50 cents (I don't know, I found 95 just scrounging around). They hold 15-35 pictures, depending on the resolution.

Second,its EASY TO DOWNLOAD.  Other digital cameras have those cables or little disks that require a holder.  No problem the first time, when you're all excited about your new purchase.  Later, when you're in a hurry and you've filled up your disk and you want to shoot more, you have to go switch on your computer, plug in the wires, click lots of buttons, wait, do it again if you've made some kind of mistake.  With a Mavica, you just whip out the disk, put it in your pocket and slap in another one.

Third, its BETTER FOR TRAVELING.  Let's say you're in London with a regular digital camera.  You have two of those $80 little disks that hold 30 shots or so.  You've filled them up.  You now have no usable camera.  With a Mavica, you can carry lots of cheap disks in a small space (I had 95 in a tape case about the size of a laptop - each day,I would carry about 5 or 6 in my pocket and leave the rest in the hotel room for the next day).  I shot over 1600 pictures in 7 days in England (basically for free).  I would have shot 68 with my Kodak digital,and I would have spent a fortune with a regular 35 mm. 

Fourth, you can GIVE SOMEONE A COPY ON THE SPOT.  With all digitals, you can see the picture immediately.  With a Mavica, you can pull out another floppy, make a quick copy, and give it to someone right after you take the picture.

Fifth, you can ORGANIZE your pictures easily.  As with all digitals, you can save your pictures in organized folders on your computer. This is a BIG plus for disorganized slobs like me.

Sixth, COPYING is easy an instantaneous, as it is with any pictures stored on computers.

Seventh, you can put SOUND with your picture. This is a neat option.  Explaining a picture or adding the surrounding sounds and dialogue makes for a very special picture sometimes.

Now for the disadvantaqes.

First, the RESOLUTION IS LESS.  All other digitals seem to have much higher resolution than Mavicas.  IF you're printing (why? I just do a slideshow on the monitor), this may matter (it may not, Mavicas are getting close to the resolution threshold where lots more pixels makes a very minor difference.  With pictures of subjects with vibrant colors, you may be disappointed with printed Mavica pictures, although colors seem pretty good on pictures displayed on a monitor.  Get the highest resolution Mavica available at the time you buy.

Secondly, all digitals are SLOWER.  The camera has to record the picture after you snap it.  Forget about a quick second shot or a series of quick shots.  Maybe that's why they put the capability of taking a little movie.  (See below).

Thirdly, shooting with a Mavica is DIFFERENT.  When you aim a Mavica and take a shot, it comes out differently than if you aim a 35 mm the exact same way and try to take the same shot.  You have to get used to shooting with a Mavica.  Take lots of practice shots before you shoot something important.  Remember, you can always delete shots you don't want.

Fourth, it's kind of BIG.  Floppy disks are big, so the camera is big.  It fits in the pocket of many of my pants, put only by itself, and it's a big of a squeeze.

Fifth, the MOVIE FUNCTION IS NOT GOOD.  Most Mavicas can take short movies.  The resolution is really bad on the movies and the picture is jumpy.  It's not very useful.

Overall, I love it.  The convenience far outweighs the disadvantages for me. <br><br>
