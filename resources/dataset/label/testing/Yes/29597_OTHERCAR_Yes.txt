            After watching BMW Z3's zip around for the past few years, I decided to dust off my old Triumph TR6 for some fun-in-the-sun driving... only to find that it needed thousands of dollars of maintenance and upkeep - and that still didn't guarantee it would pass smog!

<b>The Search</b>
So, I looked on the web and, after trying Miatas, Del Sols and the ill-fated Mercury Capri, I found a 2nd-hand 1995 Miata with 60K miles on it. Del Sol's had awkward styling and high prices, possibly because they were introduced a few years after the Miata. The Mercury Capri, a cousin to the Miata as they share a Mazda engine, looked more like a Fiat. Given that the Capri's were discontinued in 1995, I had a concern about parts and service availability.

<b>Why Miata?</b>
The Miata, a stylistic clone of the old British Lotus Elan, revived the roadster rage in 1990  with its simple lines and its Mazda-engineered reliability - something British Leyland of the 1970s couldn't claim to offer with its sad sack line of TR6's, TR7's and TR8s as well as the MG's.

Miata's have held their resale value quite well - and why not? They are popular second-hand cars here in LA. They can outhandle a Z3 and still leave you with enough pocket change to go to a Miata aftermarket shop to dress up the car! Best of all - they are still being made so parts are plentiful! 

The beauty of the Miata is that it offers the very basics of what a sports car driver wants - good handling, an easy to drop roof, and reliability so that you DRIVE the car - not FIX it.

<b>Used car advice</b>
Some advice about buying a used Miata. First of all, find the lowest mileage possible. One quick scan of the classifieds turned up most cars with over 100K miles on them. While the engines of the Miatas are oil-thirsty, they are nevertheless rated very highly by all used car reviews so go for the lowest mileage car you can get. You can always add options but you can never take away excessive mileage!

Secondly, take the car to a mechanic. If you are AAA, take the car to their inspection stations. Otherwise, call a mobile mechanic in to inspect the car. I spent $60 on an inspection and it was the best money I've ever invested in a car. He made a list of repair recommendations which I used to bargain the price and take to my local garage to get the car reconditioned.

Thirdly, get the VIN number and run it through carfax.com - a VIN record service that will tell you if the car has been salvaged or in a major accident - also very handy since used car dealers don't have to disclose EVERYTHING to you.

While I love the smell of a new car, the best thing about having this 2nd hand Miata as our second car is that we're not paying $30,000 for a new Miata but we're still getting practically all the fun of a low-cost drop-top on the California coast!

Update - given how bad LA traffic and driving is, I'd recommending getting driving lamps on the car so that people don't accidentally run over your Miata in their oversized SUV.
