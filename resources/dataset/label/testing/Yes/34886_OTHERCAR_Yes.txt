            Just got my EX after waiting for 5 weeks.  Previously, we owned full size conversion vans and I wasn't sure if I was going to like a mini-van.  So far, I LOVE IT!!!!  The only grip I have is that the seats need more lumbar support and the passenger leg room isn't roomy for my 5'11&quot; frame.  I believe the gear shift is way too close to the radio controls, but I can get use to that.  Other than those few things, this van is more than one can ask for.  The Odyssey is the world's best secret for mini-van lovers!  Many of our friends have other mini-vans, but say that they never thought about looking at the Odyssey and now they wish they would have.  You can't beat all the options that are standard on the EX model.<br><br>
