            We purchased the 1999 2-Door Blazer Sport about 11 months ago.  It is the best vehicle we have ever purchased.  We compared it to the Ford Explorer and found that there was more legroom and headroom in the blazer.  Price is probably comparable to the Ford Explorer; however, we found that Chevrolet dealers were more willing to bargain than the Ford dealers.  We have no regrets.  In the 11 months we have owned it there have been no mechanical problems.  In fact, the only problem I can report is the seat release handle broke but the dealer fixed that immediately.  Personally, I think the Blazer is a sportier looking vehicle in comparison to the other SUV's on the road.  Mine has the spare tire on the back which adds to the sporty appearance.  Another plus is Chevy's standard ABS brake systems.  If you are in the market for an SUV I would definitely recommend the Chevy Blazer.<br><br>
