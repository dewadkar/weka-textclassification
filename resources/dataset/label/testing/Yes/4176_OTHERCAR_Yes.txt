            This year I finally was able to get a Caravan.  Yes I�m one of those moms who need the extra room for their kids.  My boys are in high school and they are always into some sort of sport activity, so with this new caravan I figured it would help us all out.

We love to go camping every summer, and with our old Grand-Am we wasn�t able to pack to much stuff on our trip, but wow now we can get everything we need in this caravan.  So let me tell you a little about this van and why I like it, and what I think could have been better with it.

My caravan is a light blue in color, this wasn�t my first choice in color of the van, but was the only one available where I was looking at.  I would have preferred a green color instead, but I will not be so picky.  The space is great, the front of the car has two bucket seats and lots of great leg room.  This is one thing I liked cause when we go on trips I don�t have to feel all smooshed up front.  The front seats recline back so this is good as well on those long family trips for vacation.

The dash board is cool it gives you all the warning signs like all cars do, but when you are low on gas a little gas tank will light up and then it will give out a ringing sound to warn you to get gas.  When you hear this sound this let�s you know that you have about 1/8 of a tank of gas left in your van.  There is also a little button you can click that has a vehicle hood sign on it, this allows you easy access to the back of your van. 

 Once you park your car you click this button and the back hood will open up for you.  One good feature is you don�t have to worry about anyone touching the button and clicking it to open while you are driving, because it won�t work.  The only way it works is when your van is in the park position.

You also have a back windshield wiper, now this I just love.  You can either push a button to just clean the windshield or you can push the other one to keep the windshield wiper on all times.  And yes you can even fill up the back tub for windshield wiper cleaner.  Both the window and the back windows have their own separate tub to fill up with fluids.

Underneath the passenger seat in front is a storage box.  This also has a lock on it, I like this cause I can store some important things inside it and not need to worry.  The van is a 6 cylinder I think and not to sure of what engine size it is.  Remember I�m just a women  ( lol)

Now onto the back part of the van, and the luxuries that it has to offer.  I have 3 children too teen boys and a daughter whom is 9.  Well in our old car they use to always fight over where they were going to sit, either by the door on each side or the middle.  NO one wanted the middle.  

Well no more fighting over where they are going to sit now.  With all the room in the back and the two long seats there is room for them all to sit and relax.  My boys normally take the first seat and my daughter likes the back, because she gets it all to herself.

The seats are moveable and the back one lies down if you need it too.  You can also remove the back seat for more room.  This is good for when you are buying something at the store that is big and you need that extra room.  I have to use it like this when I go buy my new carpet; this gives me the room I need.

There is also cup holders on the side of the van for the back seats this allows your child to put his cup or pop can it and not need to worry about holding it and getting tired of it.  There is also enough space between the seats and the doors to get inside the van.

The radio is great and the sound is awesome, the kids have to always have it playing when we are in the car.  I like it cause I can put the sound to go to just the back if I want to.

The gas tank holds up to 20 gal of gas.  With the price of fuel going up this is hard to keep full, but when I do fill it all up I have to say it last�s me awhile.  I don�t think it is that bad on gas mileage.  All in all I have to say this caravan has help this family out a lot.  We truly love it and wouldn�t go back to just a normal sized car again.

My kids at first was like � mom not a caravan� but now they are so happy cause they can bring their friends and we are all comfortable when we drive.  So I would suggest buying this van or any like it if you have children.  Even if you don�t have kids, I would still say a caravan is great for anyone because it gives you the space you need for relaxation.
