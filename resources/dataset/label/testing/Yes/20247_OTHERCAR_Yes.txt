            We purchased a 1990 Cutlass Supreme International three years ago and have been extremely happy with the car.  The car had 99,000 miles on it when we purchased it (husband is good with cars so we don't usually worry too much about miles)  Since that time we've only had one problem with it.  The fuel pump went out a year after we bought the car.  The biggest problem is that the International edition has a different pump than the SL and base model and we were given the wrong pump twice!

We bought this vehicle because we needed something reliable that we could depend on for a few years.  The car had great features - leather seats, power everything, even a computer that tells you the date, estimated time of arrival, when we need to change the oil, how much fuel we've used, current MPG, average MGP, etc.  VERY COMFORTABLE for long trips.  A friend at work calls it the &quot;luxury-mobile.&quot;

I cannot think of anything I don't like about this car except that when we got in an accident the insurance company tried to tell us it was worth considerably less than it actually was.  This came from the fact that they base their price on an average value of &quot;similar&quot; cars.  Naturally, most of the similar cars were not internationals, which greatly decreased the cost.  (We talked them around to our side, though!)   One other item - this car was painted during the era of GM's new &quot;primer-less paint.&quot;  That means that the paint is beginning to flake off on the trunk and roof.  

I would think that this vehicle would be a GREAT college/high school car or a good car for a family.  I guess it all depends on what you can afford.  Due to the age, I'd think it would be wise if you could do some repairs yourself, though, like I said, we've had only the one problem with ours in three years.  The car now has 115,000 on it.  <br><br>
