            40.5 miles per gallon! But it seems to be made for people with very long arms.

All my &quot;car buff&quot; friends said the manufacturers lie when they give the estimated miles per gallon, but I was thrilled when I filled up and found that I really, honestly got 40.5 miles per gallon. I drive over 120 miles each day, so this was my top criteria in buying a car.

Cuteness was high up there too, and I personally love how this car looks. Obviously, this is a subjective thing.  

Comfort was important to me as well. I like how the seats are very high up. That, combined with the off-center console gives a pretty expansive view of the road.  Much better than my old car, which was significantly bigger and more expensive.

True, the car is a little gutless. However, I see this as a plus. It will keep me from getting speeding tickets. (Really, I'm not kidding...I like this feature.) I can still get it up to 80 MPH when I want to, but it doesn't happen quite as effortlessly as in other cars I've had.

Also, I consider it incredibly roomy for such a little car. There is a surprising amount of room in the back seat, and the trunk is good sized too. (And I like the fold down seat option that lets me put long things in the trunk.)

I also like all the storage space they provide. The double glove compartment is especially neat. Not entirely sure how useful it is, but I like the idea that I can keep my sunglasses separate from my maps...I'm not sure why I like that, I just do.

Oh yes, and on that long arms comment. This is really my only complaint about the car: I can't reach anything. The cupholders, the little knob to adjust the side mirrors, and the door locks are all just a little bit out of reach. I think I have pretty average length arms, so it makes me wonder what they were thinking when they designed it. Maybe it was like the mars lander thing...they forgot to convert from metric to American measurements!

Anyway, bottom line is that I am completely enamored with my Echo. In fact I think I'll go wash it right now :-)<br><br>
