            I've been waiting for several years to buy a digital camera.  I was waiting for quality, megapixel cameras with lots of features to be considered &quot;entry-level&quot; and cost in the $300 range.  When I realized the time had come, I did lots of research and decided on the Olympus 340-R, until I realized it was in the process of being replaced by the new 360-L.  I purchased the 360-L as soon as I could find it, from ecost for under $300.  

I have owned the camera for about 2 months and several hundred shots and I could not be happier.  It takes great shots in auto mode, but has plenty of features to allow for precise adjustment of exposure/white balance/etc.  The macro mode is unbeatable!  Crisp close-ups as close as 4 inches from the subject!  There is no zoom, except for a not-too-useful 2 times digital, but I think you would need to spend at least another $100 to get a zoom feature on a similar camera.

What I was mostly worried about with a digital camera was battery life and time-lags.  The 360-L has been great on both fronts:  I purchased 4 AA NiMH batteries and a charger on a friends advice, and one charge will last for more than 100 shots, including some flash and LCD screen use.  And startup time is almost none, with maybe 3 seconds lag between pictures.  

On the down side, the menu interface is language independent by using all icons.  Several of the icons are not obvious, but after using the menu for a week, I knew them all by heart.  The software shipped with the camera is reasonable, but you'll want another product for serious editing.  And downloading the pictures to a computer through the included serial cable can be slow.  I upgraded to a USB smart card reader.

But these are minor annoyances compared to the great features of this camera!  And the best thing about all digital cameras is that if you take a bad shot, you can delete it on the spot, and re-use the &quot;film&quot; for another picture.<br><br>
