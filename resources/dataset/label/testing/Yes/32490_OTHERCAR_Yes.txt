              I purchased my '98 Chevy C2500 HD Ext Cab truck in May of 1998. The truck was brand new and the only one in the Southeast! The truck is two wheel drive with the locking differential option. The truck is equipped with the Cheyenne package, so the frills are few. It has the 5.7L Vortech engine(350 cid), 3.73 gear and the heavy duty everything package. This is one serious work truck!
  My wife use the truck for her business, ornamental concrete and statuaries. She routinely loads 4500lbs of concrete in the bed. At one point, I had a 9000lb tandem trailer (carrying a forklift) and 3500lbs of concrete in the bed, the truck never balked. We drove this combination 55 miles! I have the pictures to prove it. If you can load it, she will haul it.
  We are on the third set of front brakes at 82,000 miles and the second set of tires. There has been the little things (all GM's do) go wrong, but nothing major. The extended cab has been a nice feature. On trips, I can almost strech out. Gas mileage, unloaded, is surprisingly good. The ride is fairly quiet and smooth (remember to drop the tire pressure form 80psi to 35psi). Tilt, cruise and AM-FM cassette make up the luxury items. I installed a set of dual exhaust pipes at 15,000 miles. I love the sound of this truck. I drive with the stereo off on occasion. Acceleration is surprising for a 5400lb vehicle.
  If you are looking for a truck that will carry load and not break, here is your truck. Solid, long lasting workhorse. My other truck is a '98 Toyota Tacoma 4WD.  <br><br>
