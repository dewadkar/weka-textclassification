            Jeeps have had a close relationship with our nation and should have one with you.  Back in world war one and two, the jeeps were the cheap and powerful machines that sent the allies to victory.  Jeeps have always come with special build that makes them so unique as to have a type of car named after them.  Other companies have tried to make their own &quot;Jeeps&quot; but have failed.  Jeep has also made them cheap enough to catch your eye and a powerful 4 wheel engine that will pull you in for the buy.  They have never been known for their looks but who cares about looks.  The Grand Cherokee has been made with a nice sort of luxery on the interior.  If you are just going to ride around to your office and back then this is the car for you.  Even if your office is a mountain top and you just drive back and forth then this engine and car will get you there.  I have always loved all types of Jeeps and the Jeep Grand Cherokee is the leader in all ways.  I can almost promise that you will fall in love with this jeep so check it out at the nearest website or dealer.<br><br>
