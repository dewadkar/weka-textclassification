            If you are in the market for a upper class SUV, look no further. I bought my Expedition in August of 1998. I love it. I have not had any trouble with it at all. The ride is exelent you feel like you are floating on air but have extreme control at the same time. I have the Eddie Bauer edition
leather seats. (have held up very well). 6 disk cd changer in the center consell. this is a great feature because you controll the change from the radio, so there are no remotes to fool with. sound quality is great.I have four children. We all fit very nicely in this vehicle. On long trips that require luggage I need to use the roof top luggage rack as cargo space is at a premium if you have the optional third row seating. I am an advid deer hunter . I have taken this vehicle on all sorts of four wheel roads. Places where passangers where saying &quot;you are going to get stuck&quot; I have never been stuck. I strongly   believe that this is the option for upper level full size suv. If there is a down to this truck it would be the gas milage. I get about 13 city and 17 on the highway. Oh if you buy one get use to people staring and pointing at you.<br><br>
