            The dodge neon is a great small car and is stingy on gas.For a small car it is very roomy.It will comfortably sit four people with room to spare.It has large cargo area as well.The vehicle holds the road well and is very easy to drive.Seats are comfortable and nice.It gets around 35 to forty miles a gallon on fuel.It comes with a lot of the features in large cars.Ours had a cd with an excellent sound system.The air conditioner will run you out it gets cold in a hurry.Excellent car for family or college student.It is priced very reasonable at around 12-15 thousand dollars.It also comes in a wide variety of colors.You can get an automatic transmission or straight shift.It is a front wheel drive vehicle and has power steering as well.I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good car and has economy in mind.<br><br>
