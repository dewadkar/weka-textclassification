            My dad is a die-hard chevrolet man, and he was encouraging me to buy a camaro.  But when I got a look at the firebird, I knew I had to have one.  (And it's basically the same car, right?)

I bought my firebird new when I was 19.  It is a 5 speed, 3.4 liter V6.  The color is aqua, with gray interior.  Of course I wanted the Trans Am, but I couldn't afford the insurance at the time.  

Needless to say, this has been the best car ever.  After 7 years I have never had any problems with it.  I've just kept up the routine maintenance.  It still seems like brand new, and I just can't bare to part with it.  It is so fun to drive.  It's easy to shift.  It handles great.  It's not nearly as fast as the Trans Am, but it sure hugs the road.  As with any rear- wheel drive vehicle, it slips and slides a little in the rain.  We won't even talk about snow, but it's not really meant for anything like that anyway.  

There's plenty of room in front, and everything is in perfect reach.  The radio, and all the controls are right there at your fingertips.  The seats are completely comfortable.  I can drive comfortably all day, but you might as well not try to sit an average size adult in the back seat.  (I've heard it's only there to lower insurance costs.)  There is no leg room back there, but the car seat fits perfectly!  It has ding-resistant doors, which is great for avoiding people who sling their door open into your car in parking lots.  

This has been an excellent car.  I hope anyone purchasing a newer firebird/trans am enjoys theirs as much as I have enjoyed mine.  I plan to buy a Trans Am when they come out with the new body style.  On the 10-year GM schedule, that should be what...2003?  Guess I can wait til then.
