            The integra is a very fun car to drive. Plain and simple. The car inspires the same emotions as those little zippy go-carts we used to drive when we were kids. In fact, thats probably the best way to desribe the integra: a go-kart for adults.

Interior room is hard to come by, especially for anyone over 6 foot. The backseat wasnt intended for anyone over 5'6&quot;. Trunk Space is mediocre. And the dash identical to the econo-box civic. SO WHAT?

You dont buy an integra to throw 5 adults in and travel across cross country. You buy an integra for the unique thrill of a sport-compact car. Its size affords little interior room, but for some odd reason, its one of the selling points. As well it should be. The car is easy to drive and very light weight, making it easy to toss around in the corners with. Even with the lower models 135 hp i-4, the car has plenty of zip.

Thats not enough zip for ya? Well theres always the Integra Type R, one of the founding fathers of the pocket-rocket-import-racing scene. Type R comes in at 195 HP, and weighs even less than the lower models. Stock form, the type R turns in high-mid 14 second 1/4 mile times. Who said a 4 cylinder was made for economy? WRONG, economy is just an added benefit of building and driving a sport-compact car. The smaller engines are capaple of producing huge number, all while saving major weight when compared to other v6's and v8's.

And then theres the aftermarket support. Anything you could possibly want is available from a number of distributors. The integra aftermarket support may very well compare to the ford mustang's support. Very few other cars have such a huge following. This helps guarantee a huge selection of parts, all at affordable prices.

The Acura Integra, the go-kart for &quot;big&quot; kids.<br><br>
