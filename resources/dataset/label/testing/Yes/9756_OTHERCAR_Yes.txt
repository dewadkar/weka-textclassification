            This digital camera provides exceptional picture quality. It is a pleasure to use, extremely portable, and has an outstanding battery life. I shot hundreds of pictures on my trips in US, Japan and Canada in last four months under various lighting conditions: portraits, landscapes and close ups. Also, the camera looks and acts cool.
Let me go into more details about pictures. The pictures taken outdoors have exceptionally accurate colors, portraits come out very nice and without distortion (Note! For very accurate portraits use tele (zoom in) mode, because in zoom out mode the camera gives the so called 'barrel distortion' or 'fisheye') The pictures taken with flash are good and sharp. But two exceptions must be noted that result from flash being to close to lens. First, Coolpix 2500 is very prone to redeye. Practically every shot of a human or an animal taken with flash guarantees beastly look and leaves you with no choice but to use software to fix your scary shots. Second, using flash in rainy or dusty conditions gives mysterious bubbles all over the shot, which is a defect but does look kind of artistic.) Another problem with the camera is that its antiglare screen is very prone to scratches, even if you wrap the camera in a plastic bag. Nikon made mistake by not including the case in the package (I highly recommend to buy this inexpensive case).
Enough bad stuff, what else is good about CoolPix 2500? Battery life! Nikon says battery lasts for two hours, but they mean continuous use. In reality, it lasts for hours and hours in real on/off use and is enough to take about 100 shots without flash (but it is anyway a must to have an extra battery). Also, the camera comes with 16MB flash card (not 8MB, as mistakenly noted sometimes, 8X is the speed of the flash card not its memory).
What is even more important, the camera indeed provides ONE TOUCH upload with included Nikon software. Also, its swivel function is nice for self-portraits and picks at a parade. Just lift the camera above those annoying heads that block your view on a parade and swivel the head (of the camera not of the guy in front of view...): camera sees the parade, you see the camera!. Even though it is only 2 mega pixels, for 4X6 prints it is more than enough to produce amazing prints that ravel those from much more expensive cameras. Oh yes, its close up (macro) mode is outstanding and pictures of flowers or insects come out like from National Geographic.
