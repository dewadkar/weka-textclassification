            We have been the proud owners of three Honda automobiles in the past 12 years, all Accords.  The first one we purchased was a 1982 model and when we decided to purchase a newer car it had been driven 250,000 miles.  We then gave this car away to a young friend who ended up wrecking it, but before that was still a very good car.  

The 2nd Honda we owned was a 1987 Accord which had 99,000 miles on it when purchased, and we gave it to our son when it had 223,000 miles.  We now own a 1990 Honda which was also used when purchased. This one had  154,000 miles on it and currently has 222,000 miles and still drives and rides like a new car.  It uses very little to no oil.  What more can you say?

This is a compact car and doesn't have the room that a large car has, but even with that, it has a good size trunk.  The back seat folds down and you can extend a large item from the trunk and into the back seat.  We have hauled 10 foot 2X10 lumber, mowers, bicycles, and so much other stuff that children and husbands seem to require taking from one place to another.  The only &quot;con&quot; is that all of these have had four cylinder engines but this allows for excellent gas mileage.  On a trip to Florida last year we got 34 plus miles per gallon.

What wonderful cars!  All three cars have required only light maintenance compared to the number of miles driven.  Needless to say, we highly recommend the Honda Accord automobile and intend to purchase another one.<br><br>
