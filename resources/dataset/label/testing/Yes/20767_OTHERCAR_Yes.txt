            I had never driven a CRX before a friend of mine let me drive his '86.  That day changed my outlook on sports cars.  I instantly fell in love with the car, and vowed to someday own one.  Well, two years later I have a 1990 CRX Si.  It is the greatest car I have ever owned.

First off, let's talk about the handling.  The stock suspension is superb, and allows you to outhandle cars 3 and 4 times the price.  It is truly point-and-shoot.  I have autocrossed my car (see my webpage at http://www.importspeed.net/hondapages for more on autocrossing) numerous times, and I am always amazed at the handling prowess of my little rocket.  Yes, I called it a rocket.

Sure, out of the box it only comes with 108 horsepower.  But if speed is what you crave, then there is no limit to the additions you can make to the stock 1.6 (or 1.5, if it's a DX).  Headers, intake, exhaust?  Yep.  Engine internals, cams, pistons?  Check.  Superchargers, turbochargers, intercoolers?  We got 'em.  If you need something to go faster, it's most certainly out there.

This is why the CRX is a perfect platform for an aspiring racer on a budget.  I attended an autocross last year where 10% of the cars in attendance were CRX's.  They are just that good.  And legend Ed Bergenholtz just reached low 9's in the quarter mile with his CRX.  Amazing.

But what about the non-racer, just looking for a daily driver?  Well, then let's talk about the 45 miles per gallon you'll get on the highway.  Or the aforementioned handling and snap-neck accelleration, which has allowed me to get out of the most dangerous of situations.

Oh, you travel?  Well maybe we can lure you in with the terrific bucket seats, the 25 cubic feet of cargo room, or the sunroof.  

And one more perk?  The price tag.  Look around for a bit...I can assure you that you will find NO CRX (with the exception of the highly modified ones) for over $6,000.  They are simply that cheap.  I was able to pick up mine for under $3,000, and it will probably last me another 150,000 miles.

So there you have it.  Whether it's a race car, daily driver, or whatever you need it to be, the CRX delivers.  <br><br>
