            We liked the features / price ratio so much that we went ahead and bought one!

One week before the birth of our third child, we decided it was time to upgrade to a vehicle that could not only hold the family, but any other passengers that wanted to go anywhere with us as well.

Our model has a great overhead console that gives the driver information about the vehicle's economy, outside temperature, direction, etc.

The salesman REALLY emphasized to us that there were a LOT of cup-holders... because of complaints &amp; suggestions from earlier models...  Well, after getting the Venture home and loading it up with family &amp; friends, we realized, that most of the cup holders were molded into the back of the seats, and the cup holders couldn't be used if you had the vehicle loaded with 8 hot &amp; thirsty soccer players...

Otherwise - It's a GREAT buy!  No wind noise, seats 8 comfortably, great ride, rear air / audio....<br><br>
