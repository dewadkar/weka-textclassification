            I haven't seen a car that will match the Neon dollar-for-dollar in the  miles-of-smiles, or overall design categories.  While I'll admit that the Neon is not without its shortcomings, it is indeed a well-engineered car. I have not seen a car in the last twenty years that is easier to service, both cost-wise and accessibility-wise.  I prefer to think that the Neon is for people who want a very fun, stylish, maneuverable car that says, "I'm going to have fun in this car, dammit".  It is not for the faint of heart, it is for the racer in all of us.  If you want a more trouble-free, yet more expensive car, get a Corolla, or a Civic - fun isn't for everyone.

Number of Neons in the Family - 3  every one with a blown headgasket graciously fixed by Ma Mopar.

Smiles per mile - 3.56

Mileage city/highway - 26-29/32-37

Scared passengers - 51 :)

Maintenance cost - $150 in two years of ownership

Maintenance 
first week - Head gasket failure.  Judging by the way the car was cared for, I might suggest that this was a pre-existing condition.  Apparently, this is a very common problem, at least for the early models.  I'm discouraged by this - iron block/aluminum head engines often have this problem, even Toyotas.  Apparently, there was a mid-year change during the '98 production that made the failure far less common, so kudos to Mopar.

Later - spark plug wires replaced at 41K (about 4K earlier than they are supposed to last.  Replaced with Mopar Performance wires - much better, and they match my car!  ;)

Steering knuckle replaced (I drive it HARD), and it probably won't be the last time.

Had it painted (on Chrysler's dime).  I have a Lapis Blue car, and apparently this color is a bad one for peeling, along with White.  I believe that the problem lies in the primer used - its shiny, Hello? I would say that although the color is very cool, it is the biggest problem with the car.  When I had it painted (for the second time - the first was before I owned it) they returned an almost textbook example of how NOT to do a paint job ie; dirt in the paint, white(!) overspray, air bubbles in the paint, nasty orange peel, and poor masking.  Being an ex-painter, I might be a little picky, but come on!  Oh by the way, when I got the car back, it was peeling on the rear door (they painted the roof only).  I guess it's a little unfair to blame Chrysler for the botched job, since they farmed it out, but the dealership DID choose the shop.

Other than that, it has been very reliable.  Which is no small feat because I flog it endlessly.  Another nice thing I have found about the car is it seems very sensitive to suspension modification.  I added some High-rate Mopar Performance springs, front & rear ACR sway bars, ACR/sport mag wheels, and I upgraded the tires, the difference you would not believe.  In short, I dig this car... very much.  I would it like even better if they took fewer short-cuts when they designed some of the parts that went into the car.

Update: 94,000 miles and as good as the day I brought it home.  In fact, it's better since I upgraded the springs and struts.  Man, I dig this car...
