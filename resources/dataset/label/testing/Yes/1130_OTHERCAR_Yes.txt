            I would highly suggest that anyone consider buying a new Dodge. From my experience, everyone that represents Dodge treats you like a VIP. The respect you will receive from Dodge representatives is unreal. Dodge has treated me like no other automobile company has in the past. Dodge is helpful, understanding, and buyer friendly. The sales staff was never pushy. As a matter of fact, it was nicely suggested to me by the salesman and other sales staff that I fill out a credit application first before looking at any car on the lot. Why? Because, we all could go from there and see what I could get financed and I would not be upset if I could not get into a new car. Ford doesn't do this nor does Chevrolet. Someone I know went to a Honda dealer and was informed that they couldn't test drive a car until they put some money down toward the purchase of the car. That is such a pure way to treat a customer! 

Dodge is different. Dodge does not sell you a car and forget about you. I receive owner information, service reminders, and news from both the dealer and the corporate office.
Besides Dodge's warranty is wonderful. You get tailored coverage. I like that considering I take care of any car I own religiously.

As for my 2000 Neon ES, this is a wonderful car! It does handle well on a long trip and it is comfortable to ride in for long periods of time. It is quick, comfortable, and sporty. You get more for your money than you will buying a small Honda, Ford, Chevy, Subaru, or Nissan. Most of those cars are well over $20,000 loaded. Do you really want to buy a small car for that price? I can see doing that if it was a Porsche or a MG? But come on we are talking about average everyday &quot;get me to work and back&quot; cars!

Look, this Neon corners as if on rails. It rides smooth but yet gives you enough road feel. There isn't any vibration in the steering wheel or dash. Yes, there is engine noise. I like that. What is a car without engine noise? I wanted a car not a space ship.

Yes, I'd buy another Dodge Neon just as long as it wasn't owned by a teenager. Teenagers on a whole don't take care of a car like it should be. They will tear up a car quicker than anything trying to play &quot;six feet tall and bullet proof.&quot; Cars are to be loved and taken care of. Oil changes are important. Putting the pedal to the floor is cool but not all the time for this will add extra wear on a car's engine. Then, teenagers have nerves to get mad when their cars break down.
