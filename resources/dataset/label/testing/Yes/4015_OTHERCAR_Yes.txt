            This car is perfect for any teenager, like myself, who needs a good first car.  I bought mine off a friend who wanted a new car.  I paid $1,000 for it.  I've had the car a year now and I can't believe how well it is still performing.  Since I bought it, the only thing I've had to do to it is put new tires on it and give it a couple of oil changes.  

The car is great on gas and is very easy to maintain. It is a nice small car and easy to drive.  Perfect for anyone who is just starting out.  The Mazda 323 may not look all the great but believe me it gets the job done.  Driving this car gives me the feeling that I'm in an over-sized   go-kart, but don't let the size fool you.  The car can handle high speeds with any other car on the road.  It is a great highway car.

Overall, I'd say if you have a son or daughter looking for a first car and are lucky enough to find one of these, consider it the best of what's out there.<br><br>
