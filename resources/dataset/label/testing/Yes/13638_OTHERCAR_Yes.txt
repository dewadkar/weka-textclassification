            In April 1998 I purchased a new Sportage EX 4x4 with the five speed manual.  The sticker price was $19,500.  With a rebate and dealer discount, I acquired the Kia for $17,500.  I am 6'2&quot; and 260.  I used the Kia for commuting to work.  It was very comfortable and easy to enter/exit which is important to me.  The Sportage has yielded a consistent 22mg.  After having an 8mpg V-10 Ram, that also was an important consideration.  I found the stying to be very appealing especially with the rear spoiler.

I have heard some opinions that the Sportage is underpowered.  The 2.0 liter 130 hp engine is not a monster like my V-10 was.  But, when I pulled onto the intersate each morning to go to work, I found that the Sportage had a heart of Gold when you ran it through each gear to red line!  Shift at three to four thousand and it just accelerates modestly.  Shift at seven thousand and there is an entirely different reaction. 

I owned the vehicle for fifteen months and fifteen thousand miles.  I received several free oil and lubes from the dealer.  I did not experience and problems with the Kia.  The only concern was what the trade in value would be for a car that was new to this part of the country (Illinois).  That question was answered when I got $ 14,000 trade in on a 99 Kingcab Nissan 4x4 V-6 SE after the dealer discount and rebate was applied.  So, depreciation was 233 a month in my case.  I considered that very acceptable.<br><br>
