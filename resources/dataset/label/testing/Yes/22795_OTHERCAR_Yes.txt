            I originally had a 74 VW Westfalia. I loved the van but found it difficult to keep up with the maintenance. What attracted me most about the Hyundai Accent (1999) was the five year bumper-to-bumper and the ten year power train warranties. It has been a year and there has not been any maintenance problems. There was a left rear brake light that went out and I have rotated the tires once. The auto paint is a nice color and shine and is lasting well. The mileage has been good with an average of 30 mph.

There are some things I don't like about the car. They are as follows:
1. The car sits too low to the ground. I worry about bumpy roads.
2. The ride is rougher than other cars. Even on smooth roads, the feel
 of the ride is rough.
3. Some of the plastic fixtures look cheaply made. One example is the
plastic lining one each side of the inside of the windshield. There are two of them running from the ceiling to dash board, one of each side of the windshield. They hang losely and appear as if they are disconnecting from the surface beneath. Also the cover behind the back seat looks cheaply constructed (cardboard perhaps).
