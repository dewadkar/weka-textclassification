            While looking for a digital camera I looked in all the places possible.  First I thought I'd go with a Kodak, but found that the shutter rate was not very good at all.  Then I saw some older ones that still depended on putting wires into your computer, but this didn't work for me either.  Finally I saw the Sony Digital Mavica MVC-FD71.  This camera was just the right price.  It offers 640x480 resolution, which was plenty for me.  Remember, the higher the resolution, the less pics you can have on a floppy.  Once I checked out the Digital Mavica that was a little more and offered one minute playback, but it only offered like a 4x zoom.  THis camera gives you 10x zoom, a ton of options, and a large screen that moves with you so that it does look like a shutter oppening and closing like the Kodak model that was comparable in price.  The only thing I wish this camera had that it didn't come with, is a carrying case, but if you've noticed most high-end electronics don't, so, oh well.<br><br>
