            This car is one of the best cars if you want a small, compact car. I am 5'8 and everytime i get into the car, it is very comfortable. Everytime i am in the car with my sister(she drives) and going to  places far away, i have to say that it has one of the smoothest rides i have ever seen. This is like the main reason that i am writing this review. She has a stick shift and since i live in Florida, which isn't the smoothest state in the country, but this car still has nice shocks to absorb the bumps. When i sleep, i am the hardest person to get to fall asleep. I need to be in like one position and like not moving, but somehow i fell asleep because of the smooth ride of this car. There is no car like it, i just need to get one that fits me.  I hope to get this car someday.<br><br>
