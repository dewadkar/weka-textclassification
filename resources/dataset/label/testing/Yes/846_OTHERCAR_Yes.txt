            It has been a thrill driving around in my 300ZX for the past 4 years, and I don't plan on stopping. This is a truly unbelievable car. It has abilities beyond any sports car of its classification. I really enjoy the 240 bhp it packs under the hood. Another feat of the Z is its looks, in my opinion, it looks bolder and sleeker than some of the greatest Italian and German sports cars, not to mention that its faster than the German sports cars with the wimpy top speed of 155. This baby tops out at 160. 

This is also a great car for driving around town, with amenities such as climate control, leather seats and a nice Bose stereo system. There are many versions of the 300ZX, (2+2, Convertible, T-tops), I own the T-top version, and I love every part of it. When it's nice outside, you have an open roof, but for those treacherous days, you have a safe hard top, that's the good thing about the T-top version.

In conclusion, I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a good, reliable, fast and strong sports car. <br><br>
