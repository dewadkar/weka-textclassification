            Our Buick LeSabre 1991, it has 202680 miles and still going.

We purchased this car because of it's great reputation, it's style, very roomy, very smooth riding car and many features.  The price was a little high, but it has paid for itself over and over.  The most expensive repair is replacing the tires.

The interior in this car is in great shape and still a beautiful blue, I have had people comment on the interior and very little wear considering the mileage.  I receive quite a few comments on my car, some people love the smooth ride, the engine sounds strong.  People are shocked over the mileage and the fact that the car is in such good shape.

The only problem with the car now is the paint (original) is peeling, this was from a chemical the manufacturer removed or so we were told.  We are in the process of having the car repainted white, other than the peeling the paint still shines, the car has never been garaged kept.

We have used 89 octane Texaco gas, oil changes every 6,000 to 7,000 miles, we keep up on the maintenance of the car and this has decreased high repair bills, I have broke down two times, once due to the battery and the other was a computer chip.

We are shopping for a new LeSabre in the fall 2001, and we are keeping the car to pass on to our daughter, this time next year she will be 15 1/2 and getting ready to learn how to drive.

The Great Buick  LeSabre reputation lives on and we have proof.  Yes we would rather have a Buick.
