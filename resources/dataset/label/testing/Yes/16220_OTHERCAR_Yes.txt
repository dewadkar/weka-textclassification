            This car is the most fun-to-drive car I've ever driven.
The Quattro system gives you excellent traction, especially in the rain or snow.  In fresh, unpacked, unsanded/salted snow, all-season tires got me everywhere I needed to go safely and with considerable control.

The engine is a 2.3 liter 20 valve 5 cylinder making 164 hp.
The car weighs 3200 lbs, so it's not the fastest out there. I would say this car is fast enough to be very fun yet quite comfortable.  Call it "quick".  

The styling is not at all dated, people routinely think the car is much much younger, say a 1998.  

The interior is of considerable quality; no plastic parts to be seen.  The leather seats are firm and comfortable, and hold you well while cornering.  They are also heated for cold days or days coming back from the ski lodge...very relaxing.

All the lighting in the car is amber, a red-orange color that is much easier on the eyes and offers better night vision than the green that is so commonly used.

Steering response is quick and the feedback from the road is excellent, making driving every day a joy, not a chore.

Brake feel is firm and emergency braking is quick, the ABS is not the best in the world but it does off tons more control on the slippery stuff.

The clutch feels brand-new after 180K miles.

The transmission shifts very smoothly on all but the coldest days when it is a little "crunchy" until the fluid warms up.

Maintenance performed: Oil changes, fluids changed all around, brake pads replaced, full tune-up, timing belt changed, water pump changed, coolant flushed, oxygen sensor replaced, new tires.

Repairs performed:  Alternator replaced, fuel injector replaced, headlight switch burnt out.

Some of the quirky things about this car include interior lighting; the lighting behind certain switches will flicker and go out, then come back on when you use the switch.

Idle is somewhat erratic thanks to a buggy Idle Stabilizer Valve (a very common problem that can be fixed with a can of carb cleaner)

The motor uses about a quart of oil every 3000 miles but this is absolutely normal; every Audi I've been in (I come from an Audi family) has done this.

Alternator whine through stereo...working on fixing this.
These quirks don't really bother me.

Things I don't like:
The interior is quite small...very little headroom for those over 5'9".  I am 5'8" and my head is just under the ceiling.  

Parts are not terribly expensive, but they are higher than most.

The headlights on this car are horrible, even when aimed correctly.  I am replacing them with Euro-spec lights for better night driving.
