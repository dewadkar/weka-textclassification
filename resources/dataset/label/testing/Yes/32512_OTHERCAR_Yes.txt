            Right! So it's time to replace the venerated '96 Volvo 850 GLT wagon/box after 76K miles, what to do? The new Volvos have fallen from grace and they want $55K for the M-B with AWD. BMW's wagon is more of a sport offering and cost almost as much as the M-B.

A look at a leading consumer publication reveals the all wheel drive Audi A6 Avant listed number 2 behind M-B. Audi? Aren't they the cars that drive off by themselves, A.K.A. "Unintended Acceleration"? Nevermind that not one instance of this scary scenario was ever scientifically demonstrated or proven, the damage to the marque has lingered for years and years.

One five minute test drive is all that you will need to make an informed and intelligent decision. There is simply no other station wagon out there that can compete with the 2002 Audi A6 Avant, period. Not in looks, not in technology, not in quality. When you consider a fully loaded version can be had for $39K and a comparably equipped Volvo will cost $4K more and the M-B $15K more, it's a no-brainer.

Instead of isolating technical prowess to sedans and sports models, Audi has labored long and hard to carve out a position for itself with respect to station wagons. The A6 Avant Quattro is a true sports car that just happens to hold more things than a sedan or two-seater.

Start with a 220 horsepower, double overhead cam, five-valve per cylinder, ultra low emission, 3.0 liter V6, state-of-the-art powerplant. Drive-by-wire throttle control, variable intake timing, continuous camshaft and balance shaft adjustments, etc., etc., etc. You get the idea, this thing is advanced and powerful. Being a normally aspirated engine, this 3.0 liter won't have the stresses of turbo charging placed upon it and it will last a long, long time. But with Audi's 'Advantage' warranty program (48 months or 50,000 miles), everything, including brake pads, wiper blades and oil changes are included. When you take your car in for it's first or subsequent services, you leave your checkbook and plastic at home, everything's covered. As in WOW!

If you've heard about ESP or Electronic Stabilization Program on the Motorweek (PBS) program, you can understand that all wheel drive combined with a vehicle's ability to right itself through a corner skid would be a definite plus. This stuff is standard on the Audi Avant, they don't make you pay extra for it. The Porsche derived 5-speed Tiptronic transmission can also be shifted manually any time you want with the flick of the gear lever and there's an auto sport mode, the best of both worlds without the manual clutch. 

And you will want to shift this thing once you see how it handles. Audi has experimented with aluminum alloys for years and has incorporated these alloys into the four-link front suspension and double A-Arm rear suspension riding on 16" Pirelli P6 tires. It begs to be taken to a winding stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway. This is a family station wagon?
 
Safety highlights are stellar and include standard side-curtain air bags along with the normal complement of side and frontal airbags for front passengers. Truly adjustable head rests, tether anchors, first-aid kit, built-in retractable cargo barrier and sunshades, central locking with child-proof rear doors, even a built-in emergency triangle in the lift gate! Rear side-airbags are also available but if you have small ones be sure to skip this option unless they are older than 5 years of age. 

The power equipment groups, seating and ergonomics in this vehicle have to be experienced to be believed. Quality exudes from every pore of the interior. There's just no way to adequately describe the luxurious tactile input and review it all here. It is downright mind-boggling in it's execution and attention to detail. The quiet and taught ride exceeds the loftiest expectations and the "regular grade" Audi 'Symphony' audio system with 6 CDs in dash and cassette is all you'll ever need. A Bose system is a superfluous option in this regard. The audio system is that good.

This review could go on and on and on but just go drive it instead and do the smart thing - get it!

In conclusion, there is no other vehicle in this class that can touch it...not from a country mile. Now if the Americans could only build something like this! LOL.
