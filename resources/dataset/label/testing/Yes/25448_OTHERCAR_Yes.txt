            I have owned three Saturns since 1996.  The first was an SL2 that was a perfect car.  Never a problem and a pleasure to drive.  Two years after owning it, I got a letter from Saturn offering me 75% of what I paid towards a trade-in.  I took them up on it and bought a 1998 SL2.  Once again, this car was terrific.  I had changed jobs in the interim, and now did a lot of driving, to the tune of 30,000 miles in eleven months.

One night I was driving home along a dark back road when a deer came at me from the right side of the road.  I was on a divided four lane highway, doing about 60, and I eased over to the passing lane hoping I could get around the animal.  Unfortunately, the critter hit my passenger door and the impact spun the car around.  Picture this.  I am still gliding towards the median, but now I am 180 degrees turned around.  To make matters worse, the median has a drainage ditch running the full length.  The back end of my car (now the leading edge) left the pavement and rolled into the ditch.  The Saturn completely rolled over.  It was eery and everything seemed still and quiet.  Time moved very slowly and I was completely convinced that my neck would soon snap.

Just as quietly, though, the car rolled over onto its roof and slid slowly to a stop.  I was hanging upside down, and watched a car go by in the opposite direction, not too far from me.

Amazingly, I was alive.  I turned off the ignition and undid the seatbelt, which dropped me on what used to be the sunroof.  I tried to turn off the dome lights, but just wound up pushing the entire panel into the mangled roof.  As luck would have it, I cut my elbow on some broken glass--my only injury!  The trick now was, how to get out of the car, since it was buried up to the door panels.  I tried the driver side and passenger side doors without luck.  Adrenaline started to pump, as I was worried I would survive the crash, but suffocate.  (Obviously, I was more rattled than I first thought.)  I tried to kick the windshield out and then remembered that this was a four door car.  I could move the passenger side back door about four inches open.  Just as I was wriggling around to get the driver side door open, a biker stuck his hairy head nervously through as he pulled the door free.  &quot;Anybody alive in there?&quot; he asked.  Both of us were amazed that someone happily was.

I crawled out with only a scratch on my elbow.  All of the emergency people were astounded, too.

The body shop was sure that somebody died in this one.  The car was totaled but the insurance company gave me everything I paid for the car minus $1000 AFTER 30,000 miles of driving.

Guess what kind of car I drive now?<br><br>
