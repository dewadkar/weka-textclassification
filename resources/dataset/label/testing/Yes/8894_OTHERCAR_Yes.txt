            I bought a 1998 convertible Eclipse and I love it. I have had no problems with it yet. I haven't even taken it to a garage for anything except an oil change. It is a fun and sporty vehicle. I get a lot of compliments and everyone that I talk with loves it. I strongly recommend this car. It is fun and reliable, the best of both worlds! The only con that I have is that the trunk is a little small, however it is a convertible and I knew that the trunk was small when I bought it. It is one of those things that you have to live with if you want a convertible. When the top is down though it makes it all worth it. There are some blind spots when the top is up too, but again I knew this when I bought it. The top never leaks and it is a quiet ride, more than I can say for some convertibles that I have ridden in. Stereo sounds excellent. Overall, great car. <br><br>
