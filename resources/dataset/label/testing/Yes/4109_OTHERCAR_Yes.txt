            I bought my 1998 Intrigue GL in the beginning of 1999 with 12,000 miles on it a lot lower price than a new one. I first saw the Intrigue in an episode of the X-Files and I thought that it was a sharp looking 4 door.  I had no plans on running right out and buying one but when my wifes car started to go we started looking.  We found a slightly used Intrigue GL and just couldn't pass it up.

The car has excellent power from the 3800 Series II engine with a smooth, equally matched transmission.  There is plenty of interior room both in front and in the rear seat.  The trunk is spacious and with the fold down rear seats offers even more hauling capacity.  The automatic dual climate control system is great, especially for couples who have two different opinions on how hot or cold the car should be.

Overall, this car is an excellent deal.  I would recommend it to a friend with no quams.  I just wish that the car was a bit sportier but I intend to take care of that by adding a spoiler.<br><br>
