            My husband and I, as a rule, have only bought Japanese cars, because overall we loved how well they were made, how maintenance free they were and how long they lasted.  This is the first American made car we ever had.  We weren't expecting much, but we were VERY surprised!

Let me preface this all by saying that my husband's Dodge Intrepid is a company car.  When we first found out he was getting a Dodge Intrepid, we were a little disappointed.  As I said earlier, all we have ever had were Japanese cars.  I am sorry to say that we did not have a very good opinion of American made cars.  We had visions of the Intrepid needing to be in the shop frequently and sitting in the driveway awaiting the auto club, especially with all the driving my husband does in his job.  Well, we could not have been more wrong.

My husband got his Intrepid about 6-7 months ago.  He does A LOT of driving in his job every day.  So far, it has not needed an ounce of maintenance and has been extremely reliable.  

I like the ride.  It's so smooth and very comfortable and quiet.  It's difficult to imagine that it could possibly be any better.  I also like how safe I feel in it.  I have been in cars before where I felt like a moderate gust of wind could blow them over.  This is not one of those cars.  It feels solid and I like that.

Another thing that my husband especially likes about this car is how much leg room there is in it.  My husband is 6' tall and he frequently has clients in his car (most of whom are male).  When he drives my car (a Camry), he complains about how cramped it is in the front seat.  In the Intrepid though, he is quite comfortable.

The trunk is huge.  My husband carries all kinds of equipment and books, etc. related to his job in the trunk of this car.  It's about twice the size of the trunk in my Camry, yet it doesn't seem like anything was sacrificed in design or comfort to make it that big.

My husband has not yet had this car for a year, but so far he has been extremely pleased with and we have both changed our opinions of American made cars!  This car is definitely worth it!<br><br>
