            I purchased my 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport in March of '98, and think that it's a great car. It has had its share of small problems (which I will discuss at a later point) but is generally a trustworthy car. I purchased it because I didn't want a small sedan type car, something that would be good in snow, sand, etc. and something sporty. Overall, I have been pleased with it, though. I LOVE the look of the vehicle, the handling (though it is not that of a Mercedes), the ease of using 4x4, and the reliability. I DISLIKE the rear wheel drive (especially on wet roads when 4x4 is not needed), the way in which it is assembled (seems very thrown together) and the minor problems that I have had. Some problems have to be expected though. I do live in an area with very cold winters, and I must say it always starts well. Also, I have used it in deep snow and sand, and I does a great job in 4x4. The back seat leaves something to be desired. Its a relativly economic block seat, and the room isn't that great. You can fit, but anyone over 5'10&quot; wont be comfortable for more than an hour or two in the back. The Cherokee drives well, and has great pickup. It doesn't feel that unstable on curves, and handles well. It is a relatily light frame on a good sized engine. It doesn't handle like a sports car, nor does it handle like a truck though. It would be good for a single person, or a couple. Also a family with at most 2 small children. I would overall recommend it, but take a test drive to see how it fits you. <br><br>
