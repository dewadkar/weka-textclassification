            I spent the extra money for all the bells and whistles on my new Contour Sport: power package, sunroof, ABS, traction control.  It was worth it.  This car is a sharp looker and I get comments from people all the time about what a nice car it is. It was everything I wanted: a sporty sedan with some speed, roomy but not too big, good trunk space, comfy, sure footed in the winter, and dependable.

This car has great power and is a trip to drive on the highway.  Especially on a sunny day with the sunroof open. It also preforms well in the snow (sunroof closed), the ABS and traction control really keep you on the road.  However, last winter I met a pothole head on, and altho this was a big crater, I didn't think it should have completely flattened one side of my wheel.  There's a $500 lesson!  

There tends to be an annoying amount of brake dust encrusting my front tires on a regular bases that distracts from the otherwise awesome appearance.  

The interior of the car is well laid out and the seats are perfect for long road trips.  The gas milage could be a bit better, but it performs well on the highway.  It has really responsive handling, good pick up, and is easy to drive.  

One annoyance, I started to notice a moldy smell after it rained.  After much investigation, I found that there is a leak in the trunk seal that allows rain in.  Altho the trunk carpet was wet, Ford was not able to "find" the leak.  

This car has been completely dependable and I would buy another one in a minute.  Too bad Ford has discontinued them.  I understand why the Contour has been compared favorably to the BMW.  Great car!
