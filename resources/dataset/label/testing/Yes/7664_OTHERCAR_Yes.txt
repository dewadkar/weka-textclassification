            If you enjoy breeze, sunshine, and adventure, then the Jeep Wrangler is for you.  The Jeep Wrangler combines rugged beauty with the spirit of adventure to make a wonderful vehicle that is both fun to drive and own.  Taking care of a jeep is relatively easy, and most Jeeps require little or no everyday maintenance.  Both soft and hard tops are available, with the soft tops being easy to remove and the harder tops made for those who like less breeze every once in a while.  Almost every option imaginable is available for the Wrangler, from CD players to fog lamps and chrome detailing.  Some may also prefer the more rugged version of the jeep (which is what I prefer), because it makes every little excursion seem like an adventure.  Jeeps are virtually impervious to the elements, and although the handling may be rough at times, they can go almost anywhere your heart desires.  The only drawbacks to the vehicle are the gas mileage (anywhere from 15-20 mpg in my Jeep), and the stiff handling at times.  I wholeheartedly recommend the Jeep to anyone with an adventurous spirit and an unquenchable thirst for fun.<br><br>
