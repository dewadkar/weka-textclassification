              Last Christmas I decided to buy myself a digital camera. I knew that I wanted something easy to use, but something &quot;high quality&quot; that would take good pictures. The last thing I wanted was to spend my money on some camera that took pictures that ended up looking grainy and , well, like they were taken with a digital camera. 

  I went to Best Buy and cornered a salesperson. I asked them every question I could think of about digital cameras. I narrowed it down to the Kodak and an Olympus. They were both good cameras, they cost the same and had mostly the same features. I decided to go with the Kodak because it came with rechargeable batteries and a plug in recharger.

  I plunked down my $450 (and then some on a larger memory card) and walked out of the store. Of course I couldn't even wait to get home, I opened it all up in the car and looked at the camera. Once I got home I plugged in the battery recharger and waited patiently. After a few hours I was ready to go. 

  I read the booklet that came with the camera, but to be honest, I could have figured it out without the booklet. This camera is that easy to use. Now, after I had snapped a few photos I was ready to put them on the computer. This was the part I was a little worried about because I am pretty close to being computer illiterate. When I was at the store I bought a little contraption that you put the memory card into and then plug into the computer. I didn't need it, I could have plugged in the camera itself and been fine. That's the last time I listen to the Best Buy salesperson. 

  Once I mastered downsizing the image on the computer, I was ready to go. I annoyed all of my friends by sending them photos, but hey, I was having fun. When I print the photos out they always look amazing. I have no complaints about this camera at all. I just don't seem to use it as much as my old point and shoot. I am a lot less likely to just take this camera out and snap a zillion pictures with it, I usually only remember to bring it along if I know I NEED to take a picture of something. Also, I rarely do print these photos, they usually stay in the computer until I need to email one of them. That's something I miss about a regular camera, the actual pictures. 

  Compared to other digital cameras I have used since, this is the easiest and most fun to use. I can always depend on it to snap clear pictures. I highly suggest it to anyone in the market for a digital camera, whether it's your first or your fifth. This camera is great and worth every penny you'll spend on it. Just beware those sales people trying to get you to purchase stuff you don't need. <br><br>
