            I own a 2000 SC2 and I love it.  For one thing it is one of the most safest cars on the road.  It is also very fast and is very good on gas.  this is a good car for someone that is single because the females like sports cars. I like the seats in the car they are very comfortable and they kind of hug your body.  The car drives very smoothly and it hugs the road very well even in rain.  I will probably buy another one in a couple of years because I like this one so much.  I would recommend this car to anyone who like fast little cars.  like I said before it is one of the safest cars on the road because of the steel cage like frame.<br><br>
