            I bought my Continental a few months ago, although I never set out to buy a luxury car. I was at the dealership where I purchased our '98 Dodge Grand Caravan, which I DESPISED, looking to get rid of it when I spotted the used Lincoln. I looked at a lot of other cars, but kept wandering back over to the Continental. The more I looked at it, the more the beauty of it got to me. A strange mix of tough-looking (with the sharp wheels and a nice amount of chrome) combined with that luxury charisma. As a guy who had been driving either 300ZX cars or SUV / van type vehicles for the last few years, the Lincoln was a radical departure. I'm glad I bought it, however, as it's proven to be rock-solid and a joy to drive. The interior is pure luxury without being too plush or stodgy. The same applies to the handling and ride. With the driver-adjustable ride stiffness set to "firm", it handles and corners way better than I would have thought of a car like this. "Plush" will float you down the interstate on a cloud. There are 3 ride firmness levels and 3 settings for the amount of steering-assist available, and unlike some cars with these types of settings, each combination has a noticeably different feel. I was surprised at the firmness of the leather seats, expecting the sofa feel of yesteryear's land yachts. To my taste they're perfect. My wife and I have driven for hours with no fatigue at all in these babies. My model has most of the options, including power-adjust and heated front seats (I would have laughed before I used it on a cold morning), JBL stereo with 6-disc in-console changer (hands-down the best car system I've ever heard), built-in Motorola cellphone also in the console (can be used as hands-free with voice-activation when plugged into it's connector, or unplugged and used as a portable), electric sunroof/moonroof that will either slide open or tilt (like magic, and with zero water leaks), ABS braking, traction control (front wheel drive), a slew of fancy electronic settings (including 2-driver memory settings for position of driver seat / outside mirrors / ride and steering control / instrument panel brightness / etc.), auto-dimming rearview mirror with cool built-in electronic compass, the best cruise control I've ever used, and a lot more. The V-8 engine in this rascal has a surprising amount of power, and it's 260 or so horses will accelerate it one heck of a lot stronger that I would have thought of a car like this. I guarantee it will run off and leave a lot of cars that are supposedly fast by reputation. It has a sweet but tough sound to it when you accelerate hard, like it means business, but is very quiet and civilized when cruising. It's actually a little difficult to drive this car slow on the expressway. At 80mph it feels like 55, no kidding, and is nicely quiet with the windows up. By the way, this is the only vehicle I've ever owned, out of many, that has perfectly balanced wheels (running Michelin tires, of course); not a balancing weight to be found on either wheel and they're perfectly true. Rather amazing. The trunk is larger than some cars I've owned, but due to the body design the rear portion doesn't look overly large from the outside. The outside appearance of the car is one of those rare, rare creations that looks good from any angle. With it's distinctive chrome grille section, just the right amount of chrome trim, dual exhaust tips, and nicely-rounded front and rear corners, it has an understated elegance about it. The later year models look almost identical, so there's none of the already-dated feel as when some makers roll out their latest. The only negative I can come up with is, like most cars, if you had bought one new in '98 you would have taken a bath on the depreciation of it's trade / sell value. I bought a 40,000 dollar car with 50k pampered miles and in immaculate condition for just a shade over 13k.
