 This is one of the single most incredible cars i have ever had the pleasure of driving, which is a lot. A friend of mine who recently inherited his mother's estate, sold it and bought a Ferrari 550 Maranello. The day he bought it, he drove by my house and asked f i wanted to try out his ride. I eagerly jumped in. 
 My first impression was of the seats. WOW! the smooth leather sucks you in, and you lose all conscious thought except how comfortable you are. Then, you start the car. Once again, WOW! Just a slight depression of the accelerator, and the tach jumps! You don't remember that you're in a car, because you're not. You have just entered a new perfect existence. Only 1 thing could prevent me from marching down to the dealership right now and buying one : the price. Yes, there are a very fortunate few who can afford a Ferrari. I am sadly not one of them. 
 The best feeling you can get behind the wheel of any car is melting the tires. This was the sole reasoning behind my attempt to do so. Much to my friends annoyance, I left a large black patch of molten rubber along my driveway, and sped onto the road, heading for the freeway. During the ride, it's next to impossible to count how many staring onlookers you see, drooling all over themselves. 
 This would be one of my first cars to purchase if i could, and with a convertible model coming up (Ferrari Barchetta Pininfarina), the need for money only gets stronger.<br><br>
