            I have had my 1999 Ford Contour LX for a little over six months now. I traded in my Ford Escort for the Contour because I was looking upgrade to a bigger with more features. The Escort was more of an &quot;entry-level&quot; car--I needed something to get around town without making a huge car payment. With more money to spend on a car now, I didn't want another Escort, but I didn't want to buy a Taurus. The dealer showed me a Contour, I took it for a test drive, and I was in love.

The Contour is a gorgeous car. It looks very classy and appears to be much more expensive than it is. It's not &quot;boxy&quot; and cheap looking like the Escort, yet it doesn't have that round &quot;bubble&quot; look of the Taurus. I bought a Cabernet Red LX model with automatic overdrive transmission, 4 cylinder engine, A/C, CD player and cruise control. There are several different option packages available, such as power windows and sport packages, but I didn't want to pay for those. Ford offered several models, which ranged in price from a stripped model at around $12,000. up to the SVT model with all of the amenities and a 6-cylinder engine for around $24,000. My Contour was around $16,000.

This car is so much fun to drive! Even though it only has a 4-cylinder engine, it is a fast, zippy car to drive, even with the automatic transmission. I'm an admitted leadfoot and the Contour handles high speed without a problem. The engine doesn't strain or bog down, even with the A/C blasting. And the gas mileage is great-- I usually get around 200 miles on a tank of gas, and that's considering how fast I drive and my nearly constant use of the A/C. The controls on the dash are all within easy reach and the A/C kicks! The upgrade to the CD player and &quot;premium&quot; sound system was well worth it-- the music comes through loud and clear, with little distortion. The Contour is a bigger car than my Escort was, but it drives like a small sports car, handles great, and corners like a champ. The Contour has 4 doors and a roomy back seat with shoulder belts for all passengers. The trunk is very big and roomy, which is surprising for the size of the car. 

The Contour has been a very reliable car, after one glitch at the start. The first week I had the Contour, the alternator went out and fried a bunch of the wiring. I took the car back to the dealer and Ford immediately took care of it. The dealer apologized profusely and gave me a brand-new Ford Expedition to drive, at no charge, while they fixed my car. I received several phone calls from Ford Motor Company apologizing for the problem and making sure that the problem was being taken care of. They also threw in 3 years of free Ford maintenance of the car for my trouble. I have to say that Ford Customer Service is an A+. I would recommend the Ford Contour to anyone from college students to families. It is roomy, fun to drive, looks great and is quite affordable for the amount of car that you get.
