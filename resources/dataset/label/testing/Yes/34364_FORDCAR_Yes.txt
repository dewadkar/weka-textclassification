              When my parents were in the market to buy a new car, a Taurus is not what I thought they would buy.  I knew that they wanted something flashy and something with good acceleration, so I figured they would buy a Volkswagen or something.  When they pulled into the driveway in this, I must say I was surprised.

 My initial feelings were that this was just going to be another Ford.  It was just like all the other cars that they had bought.  Then, after riding in it and driving it, my opinion drastically changed.  As soon as I got in, I noticed that the seats were extremely comfortable.  Although they were not leather, they were extremely soft and they fit my body well.

 Seeing as how I am 6 foot 2, this is not an easy thing to do.  I also noticed that there was a ton of leg room both in the front and the back.  The car can seat 5 people with ease and no one is crowded in the slightest.

 The next part that I was amazed about were all of the buttons.  Not only were there controls for every type of A/C you could want, but they were arranged so that either the driver or the passenger could reach them, and they were easy to learn.  Also, the shifter was very economical, and it fit right into my hand.

 After starting up the car, the ride was quite smooth.  It was almost unreal how the car handled bumps and potholes without even moving around.  Seeing as how I am from upstate New York, you can imagine the number of potholes there are.  This car handled them easily and didn't even bump me around.

  Also, the acceleration was quite good for a Ford.  Normally, Ford's (especially the Taurus and Escort) tend to have a sluggish acceleration, making it hard to pass and get up to speed on the highway.  This car however, had no problems passing even on roads with a speed limit of 65.  It got up to speed quickly and stayed there.

 The brakes are fair.  We have gone through one set of them, but that's because we do a lot of city driving.  The car is ideal for the highway and gets great gas mileage.  It is an extremely good family car, but also is sporty enough for anyone to drive.  

 The features on this car are adequate.  The model we have has power windows, power locks, ABS, auto transmission, A/C...basic stuff.  The price was decent for it.  I believe that we payed 13,500 for it new.  We got a pretty good deal because we have gone to their dealership so much.  After driving this car I must say, I am impressed.

 Keep up the good work Ford, and keep building these things because I will keep on driving them!
