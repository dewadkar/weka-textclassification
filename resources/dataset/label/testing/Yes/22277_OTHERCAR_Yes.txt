            This is actually our second Mazda MPV mini-van.  Our first one is a 1989 and has 176,000 miles on it, and still runs great.  We kept it so the dog can go for rides too, he isn't allowed in the new one.  When we were ready for a new van we decided why not stick with a product that has done the job for us with a minimum amount of repairs, other than a hydraulic compressor($750.00, which the new one doesn't even have) that went out, we've done nothing but regular maintenance.  So, we test drove a 2000 MPV, what a luxurious ride.

  Plus, I could get it absolutely loaded with all the extras for less than the #1 rated Honda van with just the basics and I didn't have to wait 3 months to get it.  My van is the top of the line ES version, with leather (wonderful), 6 disc in-dash CD changer, power moonroof, fog lamps, 4-seasons package(large windshield washer tank, rear area heater/air-conditioning, heavy duty battery, heavy duty rear defogger, large radiator, a-t oil cooler and additional cooling fan), a rear seat entertainment system so the kids can watch videos or play Nintendo, and roof rack.  Those are just the extras, it also comes with tons of standard equipment. 

 Even though Car and Driver says the engine is underpowered, I haven't noticed.  It gets up and goes with plenty of power for passing,  hills, and freeway on-ramps. 

 Besides I think it is the most attractive mini-van on the market on the outside and the inside has the same drop-away back seat, sliding middle captains chair, and removable seats that the more expensive Honda has.  It's not quite as large as the Honda either, but I think that's a plus too, I don't want to have to parallel park a vehicle any bigger than this. 

 Since I spend so much time in my vehicle why not enjoy driving and I definitely enjoy driving this van.  My only complaint is the light colored carpets, but I fixed that by buying a medium weight plastic at the fabric store and making fitted covers for all the removable carpets and using hall runner plastic for the non-removable carpet that shows.  It may not look quite as luxurious, but it looks a whole lot better than filthy carpets.  Mazda needs to make a more kid-tough darker carpet for their mini-vans.  Otherwise this is the perfect vehicle.
