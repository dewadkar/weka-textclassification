            I walked into the Ford dealer near my house and saw this beauty.  It was a Ford Mustang Gt.  Red with black racing stripes on the hood and leather interior.  I thought to myself for about 3 seconds then made a decision that I must have this car.  Its absolutely beautiful and its an experience to drive each and everytime I get behind the wheel.  Everyone stares at it and not to be a materialistic but it feels good to have something that people admire.  It has a 4.6 liter engine V8 and it's power is unbelievable.  I had other sports cares but this one tops all of them in the area of comfort.  I absolutely adore this vehicle and recommend it to anyone with class and a desire for excitement and a little fast paced fun.  The only bad thing is the gas, but i'm willing to overlook that negative quality and again I will say you only live once so have fun and take chances.<br><br>
