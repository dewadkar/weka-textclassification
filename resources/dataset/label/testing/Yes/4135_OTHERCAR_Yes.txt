            I needed a replacement car form my 1987 Maxima (which was a great car) that had reached 150K miles but with new cars costing so much I was resolved to buy a used one. My friend had and has an Acura Legend. For whatever reason when I drove his first one I was not that impressed. But as I saw the Legend on the road I became more and more interested. So off to the Acura dealer I went and noticed a 1995 Legend L with 44,000 miles. One test drive and I was convinced. This car is a dream. It looks and drives like a real car. Seating is very comfortable and the leather seats are heavenly. Put the key in the ignition and the steering wheel automatically lowers to the pre-programmed position. Once you start the car and take it out on the road, the acceleration is outstanding and the ride very comfortable. There is enough road feel and the steering is very responsive. Excellent sound system. I love driving this car and am very happy to run errands for my wife-&quot;Hey no problem dear, I'll go get some milk.&quot; Naturally I go to the next county to get it. Also good rear seating room. Large truck. Have not had major problems with the car except a noisy blower motor and a broken window switch that Acura fixed since the car is certified. I think if you are looking for a reasonable luxury car that drives well, check it out. The one problem is that they no longer make the Legend and now you're spoiled. The replacement RL is not as nice.<br><br>
