            For starters I really do LOVE this truck, it is what I have always wanted.
Power,Style, and how about the great gas mileage! well ok there is 1 bad point! The real deal is that I have had my truck in several times and the problems have been with rattles and noises. No I do not go in for little sht. These were bad and it took several tries to get it fixed. That was at a few thousand miles and now at 17,000 more of the same. I should note that I have NEVER taken this truck off-road so I have not really abused it to warrant these problems. Pick out YOUR truck carefully, TURN OFF THE RADIO for a TEST DRIVE. RADIO's are a DIME A DOZEN !!! No need to start out with a lemon.

The warranty on the these trucks is good and even comes with a 1-800#, which I hope I never need! If you are going to pull ANYTHING then you better get the power cause slow trips to the lake are worse then NO trips to the lake!  If you want to get noticed then this is also for you as nothing beats a big ride (without all the lifts and huge tires!)
If you compare it to all other trucks in its class, the power, size and style will beat all other out in the end.
