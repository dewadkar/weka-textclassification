            I have had my Trooper for 5 years now.  I love it!  What a great vehicle for going to work, or going to play.  This 4 wheel drive vehicle can go just about anywhere having a high clearance, and just an all around durable frame.  I have had almost no real trouble with this truck ever since I got it, knock on wood, except for the usual tune-ups and regular maintenance.  Just change the oil, and your Trooper will love you back!  The only drawback that I can see from this truck is its gas mileage.  It doesnt do too well in the city, only getting about 14mpg.  The highway mileage isnt much better with peaks only topping 20mpg.

I have nearly 190,000 miles on my truck now, and it's taken me everywhere I want to go.  Travelling across country several times, my Trooper loves to take long trips, and see new sights almost as much as I do.  This truck has everything.  Lots of space in the back to haul whatever you want, a roof rack that can carry a sofa (I actually did this), plenty of space for you and four friends, and all the luxuries of any great car of the early 90's.  

If you are looking for a rugged, durable, and comfortable SUV that will last you a long time, the Isuzu Trooper is a good buy.  I actually bought mine used, and its served me very well.  Definitely alot of fun to drive too!  You sit high up above the normal car and can see far ahead of you if youre stuck in traffic.  It might not sound like it, but it really is a plus being able to see all around you.  The large windows guarantee visibility in just about any circumstance.  The 4 Wheel Drive comes in very handy when you are buried in snow.  The first year I had my Trooper, we had a blizzard and the snow was plowed all around, and buried me in covering the hood of the truck.  All I had to do was shovel out a space in the front of the vehichle so it could move forward a little, and a space in front of the driver's door so I could get in.  Throw it in 4 Wheel Drive, and just pull out!  It just dug right in to all that snow, and moved like a plow to get me out!  I've never experienced anything like that in my life!  

These are just a few of the great things that this truck can do.  It is just so great to know that my Trooper has done so many good things for me.  I dont know what I would do without it.  Definitely something to check out if you are shopping for a reliable truck that can do whatever you want it to.<br><br>
