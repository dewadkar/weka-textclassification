            The 2000 Mountaineer/with Monterey options recently replaced our 1997 Mountaineer; the 2000 model offers a much smoother ride and even tighter handling.  Thankfully the 2000 doesn't have the ocean-swell effect of the 1997.  The Monterey package is terrific: excellent leather appointments, good CD/Tape/Radio system, a terrific climate-control system, a moderately helpful read-out instrument status display, handy control buttons on the steering wheel, accurate cruise-control, power-control seats.

The mileage has settled in around 18 MPG highway driving at 75 MPH, 20 MPG at 65 MPH.

The 8-cylinder engine has plenty of acceleration potential even at high speeds.

All in all the 2000 is an excellent continuation of the Mountaineer line.

The only small downsides: the 2000 still doesn't have a lockable glove (or under seat) box; the sunroof seems smaller and is noisier when open than the one in the 1997.

The one BIG DOWNSIDE: the leg room for driver and front seat passenger is still marginal--forget this vehicle if you OR your passenger is over six-foot-two.  The power-controlled seats can perform a slow-mo Heimlich on the driver (I'm not kidding) but can't move back far enough for my taste, a design flaw since there's plenty of room for back-seat passengers.
