            	I own a 98 VW golf, and I can say that it is the best car anybody can own... Any model. My Uncle in France owns an 82 model that's still going strong.

The golf is such a good car because of the price you pay. We bought ours for $16 000, and they have been repayed... even in good memories...

	It's a very fun car. Actually, it's whatever you want it to be. If you feel like driving hard, and very fast (As I do), then it'll do the job fine. I've gotten out of some sticky situations in that little car. It handles like you wouldn't believe. I've been able to pull off some nice corners, without even fear of losing control. And, if you just want to relax, and go slow, it's a perfect car. You can fold the seats in many ways for storage space, and if you need to, you can always squeeze in an extra passenger... although, it does get a bit crammed back there... It's perfect in the city. It's small enough to park anywhere, and it's zippy enough to get around fast:-) 

	On a more serious note, it's a very safe car. It's pulled me through thick and thin, and I've always been confident in any situation. I don't really know the latest safety features, but VW (Who owns Audi) makes some of the safest cars... I saw an ad of thiers that said &quot;Volvo did very well in the government safety tests this year... They came in right behind Audi/VW&quot; 

	As for VW service, the warranty is nice. The checkups are free, and they know what they are doing. They aren't extremely courteous, but they get the job done (Although I heard that some VW dealerships are having problems with parts for the latest models). 

	All in all, I would say that it's a great car for anybody... It's always had a certain charm to it, that's always made it attractive. It's great for a commuter who puts on a lot of miles (Good gas mileage... keep reading). It's great for going on trips (Lots of space to store stuff like skis, groceries, etc...). And it's always fun to drive... no matter the condition. It's a perfect car.

	Time for a little story to show how sturdy this car can be. I drive quite a bit on the Hutchinson Parkway going north to the Merrit Pkway in CT. One night, I was going home from NY city, to CT... This particular stretch of parkway is very curvy... even dangerously... It was around 3-4AM, and we were about 5 in the car (Mine is a green golf gl 4dr). Some white van got mad at me for some reason, and started to chase us. He came REAL close to me, so I sped up and decided to outrun it... Well, let me tell you, I had no problems... I not only outran it, but out cornered it and all. I was zippin' through that Highway faster than I am willing to say... without a problem... We got home safely, and I say that it is largely thanks to my Golf...

	Basically, I say, if you're looking for an inexpensive, great all-around car, get the Golf. It's guaranteed to last, no matter how you drive it, and it saves you money on Gas Mileage... I drive mine both in the city and on the highway, and Highway driving, I've gotten 29 miles/gallon on Highway, and around 23-24 miles/gallon in the city... That's amazing.
