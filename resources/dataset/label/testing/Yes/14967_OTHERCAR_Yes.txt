            My wonderful husband gave this to me as a gift for Christmas.. I love it!... My sister in law had one and I was so jealous... I take tons of pictures with a regular camera that uses film, and getting them developed was such a pain...

 I love this camera because you can take a picture and see it right away.. If it did not come out the way you want it, all you have to do is delete it and take another.It uses 3.5&quot; floppy disc and can hold about 45 to 50 pictures on it.It also has a  10x's optical zoom.You can zoom in and out with the touch of a button. It is very easy to load and with a little reading from the instruction book its easy to use.

There are many different settings from inside to outdoor lighting to nighttime.You can also do black and white,sepia,negative art, and solarize without changing film like you have to with black and white.Once you have filed up the floppy you can load it onto a zip disk and reuse the floppy again and again. 

It helps by not having to waste film.. You know how depressing it is to take pictures at a special event, only to be disappointed when you get them back days later and they are not good..  Well, no more with this camera..The rechargeable battery pack is easy to use and takes about an hour to charge. Its easy getting the battery in and out. 

They are always protected and you have them forever.. Great for sending pictures to friends far away who have computers... Love it!!!<br><br>
