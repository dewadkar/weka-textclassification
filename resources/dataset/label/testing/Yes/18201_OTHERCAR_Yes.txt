            When you go to take a photo do you want to fiddle about for two minutes with settings or do you want to click and see the result. The Sony P3 is designed to work well on auto settings. In daylight I have shot a whole card of images and not had one that was badly exposed or out of focus. I've owned good SLRs and other digital cameras and know all about manual settings. But being realistic most photography at amateur level is about capturing the moment. As I've become more familiar with the P3 I am using the exposure settings more accurately for tricky lighting. The flash shots indoor can be improved by shooting in twilight mode and varying the flash intensity.
I have used all the modes and find the macro to be extremely good even with low flash and colours are quite accurate. Auto settings don't always work so use the EV and alternative light settings - indoor,outside etc - and confirm the colours in the display. Taking exposures from different areas and holding the shutter halfway in can help avoid washed out areas when there are strong lighting contrasts. The build quality of the Sony is excellent and the camera looks built to last. It is so compact that it will fit in a pocket and you won't even feel the weight.
Ultimately any camera purchase should be based on image quality. The photos I've taken can be viewed at pcphotoreview.com. These are just point and shoot examples and required little adjustment. I've found my keep rate of photos is much higher with the P3 compared to previous cameras. The card that comes with the Sony is only 8 megs and is too small. However it will keep you from snapping hundreds of snaps and make you concentrate on getting good images that you will keep so don't rush into buying a large card for a few weeks. By then you'll be aware of your snapping habits and may be more realistic in your needs.
Don't be too put off by the lack of a zoom. Many shots are done in wide angle such as landscape,portraits and sometimes the time spent in framing and zooming means a lost shot that can't be reshot. Kids don't like posing and won't hold one for more than a few seconds - then they get grumpy. Shoot at high resolution and crop with your software. I shot a birthday scene for a friend at 1280 resolution. After some fiddling on Photoshop 6 I was staggered to see it print out fullsize on A4 photo paper at very acceptable resolution and clarity - well worth framing.
I am a picky user. I like quality gear and images. I am happy with my Sony P3 and would not sell it to upgrade. It is so handy I would keep it and buy a pro camera next. However I know the Sony would get the bulk of the use.
