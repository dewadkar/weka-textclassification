            Acura has done a fine job with their recent cars designs.  The TL sedan CL couple have everything but personality.  The MDX suffers from the same problem.  Besides that it is an excellent vehicle.  The Engine offers good performance keeping it right next to the BMW x5.. but beating everything else in its class.  The appearance is nicely done.. just not exciting enough for my taste.  Fit and finish are top notch like all Acura products.  The interior is extremely well laid out.  Controls are easy and well placed.  Seats are extremely comfortable and easy to get in and out of.  The 3rd row of seats offer extra utility in crunches.  Inside the wood (fake but who cares) and leather create a classy atmosphere.  Interior size feels similar to a ML320.  The 4wd system is excellent having a nice mix of onroad traction and offroad(or low traction) prowess.  The MDX is not a "real" truck but based on the honda global platform... similarly used in the Honda Minivan.  Its a great chasis lending itself to isolation and structural rigidity.  Its steering is light making it easy for around town and its independent suspensions do a nice job of soaking up the bumps.  Overall is MDX offers the same comfort of driving as the RX300 with a bit more space and utility.  Its value priced.. in base form it has every major option.  If you need a "real" truck buy a Yukon or Land Rover... If you want a car with 4wd call volvo/audi/suburu/bmw/merc/jaguar... if you are looking for a truely comfortable refined sport utility check out the RX300 for smaller size, the Acura for more utility, the X5 for sports sedan in SUV clothing.  Overall this SUV gets my thumbs up.
