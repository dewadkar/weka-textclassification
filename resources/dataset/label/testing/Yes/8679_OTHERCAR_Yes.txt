            If you are a GM certified Cadillac owner planning to travel between the US and Canada take note. This review is the result of experiences I have had regarding my 1994 Cadillac Seville SLS.  I am a US citizen that was transferred to Ontario, Canada.  I purchased my GM certified Cadillac which still is under factory warranty just before moving to Canada.  I was assured by US Cadillac that my warranty would perform the same in Canada as it does in the US.  Upon taking my Cadillac in for service to Knight Cadillac in Belleville, I was informed that US Cadillac was incorrect with their warranty assurance.

Knight Cadillac informed me that I would have to front the cost of any repairs out of my own pocket and send the bill to a US Cadillac dealer for reimbursement.  I thought that this might be a dealer problem so I called Canadian Cadillac headquarters where I spoke with Kirsi, a customer service rep, who informed me that Cadillac of Canada does not have a code to charge warranty repairs for certified vehicles from the US.  As A result I had to pay up front the repair costs and wait over 1 month for my  refund from US Cadillac.  If you are moving or are travelling in Canada in a GM certified Cadillac make sure you have a credit card with a high limit because Cadillac repairs aren't cheap.
