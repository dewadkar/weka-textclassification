   The reason I had bought a Honda Civic is because it has its options of being one of the most reliable cars to go to these days.. It is fuel efficient, sporty, and has all the options that I had wanted. The things I love about Honda are the looks and sound you can get out of it... Its a very quite car and it can look sporty for both family and couples. The only thing I hate about Honda is the warranty coverage it offers and there policy of what happens if missing a payment by an accident that is caused by mother nature. I think those who should buy this vehicle are the ones that don't make as much money and have to travel anywhere from 30 to 60 miles a day just to get to work or school. Those who shouldn't buy this vehicle are the ones who don't feel like saving gas money and driving a car that can go over 100,000 miles or up to 300,00 miles and yet hold its value..  <br><br>
