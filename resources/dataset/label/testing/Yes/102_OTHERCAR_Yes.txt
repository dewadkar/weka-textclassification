            When life is lonely and my 401k is getting me down I can always go downtown -- but I prefer to go out of town and take a spin around in my 2002 XL-7 Limited.  We bought it in September 2002, and reviewed it here.  Fast forward to March, 2003 -- no problems, nada, zippo, just pure enjoyment.

So what else can I do in my spare time but get out to our Suzuki dealer (Jack Trebour Ford-Suzuki, Denville, New Jersey), and check out the new models.  I haven't gotten out there for service -- no need to do so -- but there is the thrill of discovery.  So -- off I went.

What's new  -- The Interior 

My heart sank, however, when I saw the interior of the 2003 XL-7.  Not that my 2002 is bad, it is just very -- competent.  The 2003 is luxurious.

The walnut wood graining on the dash has been redone and set off by understated chrome accents.  The plastics have been upgraded so that they compare well with the Mercedes dash plastics, both in disguising the fact of being plastic and in function.  (I tried to scratch the plastic with a key and could not do so.)  The radio/CD changer has been upgraded, and sits higher on the dash for better accessibility.  There are audio controls on the steering wheel.

The area between the front seats has been redesigned, with a new accessory outlet and storage for CDs under an armrest.  The lighter outlet has also been moved to the area between the front seats, thereby providing two accessory outlets, one a bit more convenient for the passenger or for a laptop on the passenger seat and one for the driver / cellphone. 

There is a new dual-zone climate control system.  The CD-changer and speakers have been upgraded and expanded.  The sound quality continues to be excellent.

Everything in the interior continues to be professionally made with a solid feel and good tactile sensations, especially for levers, knobs, and turn signals. The seating leather is beautiful.  Seats are adequate and supportive, including substantial lumbar support, but smaller than one would find in a bigger SUV, especially an SUV with only two rows. They are well-sculpted. There is plenty of headroom for everyone.  A replaceable air filter keeps the interior air fresh.  Front seats recline substantially to provide nearly a horizontal resting surface.

("Touring Edition" only:  this less expensive version now has a plusher cloth interior.  I did not like the cloth interior in the 2002 Touring; however, the cloth interior in the 2003 is much nicer and appears every bit as good as our 1992 Honda Accord's, which is one of the finest cloth interiors I have seen.  The Touring Edition now also has the dash upgrade.)  

Other than the interior, where upgrading has been considerable, little has changed.  The following observations are from a test drive of the 2003, though obviously my experience with the 2002 affect my perception.  I have decided to borrow liberally from my review of the 2002 to the extent that points continue to be applicable.      

The 2003 XL-7, especially the Limited version, is essentially a lean, mean, cost-reducing luxury machine, with excellent cargo capacity and an optional third row.  It comes with a quiet V-6 that feels like it kicks butt, especially off the line, because of the transmission gear ratios.  Nice torque.  Great towing capacity.  Still, there is no V-8 engine available, there are no lighted visor vanity mirrors, and the lock button on the remote remote is so sensitive that you will find yourself locking (but not unlocking) the car constantly. 

The build quality in the XL-7 is outstanding, the leather interior is polished and professional, the ride is quiet and refined, and the Suzuki seven year transferable no deductible power train warranty (3 year bumper to bumper) is good and is likely to address Suzuki's depreciation disadvantages versus Honda and Toyota.

The XL-7 is built in Japan, where quality really is job #1.  (Vitara/Chevy Trackers, which should not be confused with the XL-7, are built in Canada in a joint venture with General Motors.  GM joined in the venture with Suzuki in part to learn Japanese production techniques.)   

There is an attractive muscle definition to the fenders but the smaller size makes it quietly assertive.  It must be attractive, since Lexus appears to have copied the design. 

Entry and Exit 

The rear side doors are wide, permitting excellent access to the third seat.  The back door opens to the side, rather than protectively like a hatchback. The spare wheel and tire do not interfere with this operation in the slightest bit.  A few different types of cargo nets are available to assist in keeping items from falling.  We purchased one, and found it easy to install. 

The XL-7 makes very efficient use of the limited cargo space allowed by the vehicle dimensions. The spare on the XL-7 hangs proudly on the back, allowing a storage tray under the floor.  The back position protects the spare from off-road hazards, though the spare is more exposed to the hazards of other vehicles.

The seating position for the driver is high, permitting an excellent view of the road. The snout of the vehicle is tapered downward, and the view down the snout is excellent. Visibility is not obstructed by permanent large roof supports as in some other vehicles. 

The seating for the second and third rows is a bit cramped, but it is about as good as can be done given the vehicles outside dimensions. The XL-7's narrowness allows it to be maneuverable and the steering radius is good.  The tradeoff is that it is tight for three passengers sitting in the second row, especially with a child seat belted into the middle position. 

Access to the split third seat is provided by movement of the split second row seats. The levers necessary to do this are at first confusing, but once mastered, the technique is simple. 

Passengers can ride shotgun on one side of the vehicle, permitting long items to rest on the seat backs in the down position as cargo. 

Ride 

Liquid-filled engine mounts provide a quiet and vibrationless engine warm-up.  This is unusual for a "truck." ("Trucklet"?)

In normal two-wheel drive mode, the ride is competent but not luxurious. The steering is perfect -- tight and precise. There is some understeer, as expected for a rear wheel drive vehicle, but the rear wheel drive allows for good compensating acceleration out of turns. There is very little lean or body roll. The suspension is solid.  The bumps register but are not jarring. 

There is no stability problem here. Steering is precise without unnecessary play. I evaluate the XL-7 as "nimble" for an SUV. Suspension is solid, without inappropriate lean. 

Wind noise at 70 mph is noticeable, though the XL-7 is stable at that speed. The transmission is silky and smooth shifting. 

Braking could be tighter.  There is a bit more play than I like.  Bigger and better brakes, especially for the rear drums would be a nice option and would complement this SUV's sporty handling and acceleration.  The ABS works fine. 

Utility 

The XL-7 is truck-based with a solid ladder frame and has a part-time 4x4 capacity, and while we thought, based upon reading Consumer Reports, that these characteristics might be a negative, the XL-7 actually is versatile and rugged. It is nice to know that there is true 2-level 4 wheel drive, a ladder frame, and 3000 pound towing capacity. The ride in regular level 4 wheel drive is excellent.
 
The on-demand 4 wheel drive can be accessed at up to sixty miles per hour.  This allows adjustment for dangerous conditions, such as snow and ice, which tend to be obvious.  

The danger in using 4-wd on dry pavement is in turns -- as the outside of the wheels must travel a greater distance than the inside of the wheels and dry pavement does not permit necessary slippage.  So using four-wheel drive on dry pavement would eat at the tires and stress the linkages in the turns, as well as affect gas mileage. 

An additional nice feature is the automatic lighting system, wherein day-time running lights and headlights go on and off automatically, should you wish. The system is controlled by a light sensor in the dash and the parking brake. 

Exterior Fit and Finish 

Certainly above-average. Everything feels solid; doors windows, hood, and moonroof open and close nicely; there are no abnormal hood vibrations at high speeds.  The clearcoat does not feel quite as solid as the excellent finish on our 1992 Honda Accord, but it does appear better than that on our 1991 Volvo 240 Wagon, which has many scratches and swirls. 

Warranty 

The XL-7 was much better equipped for an equivalent price than any of the other SUVs we considered, including the Pilot and the Volvo, and the warranty now is better. The powertrain warranty is seven-year or 100,000, fully transferable, no deductible. The bumper to bumper is three-year (couple of exceptions, including 2-year battery and independently-warranted tires), no deductible and transferable. Perforation, however, is only three years. 

Safety 

Safety was a huge consideration in our purchase of the 2002. The XL-7 has done very well in the insurance organization 40 mph crash tests, emotionally nullifying any advantage Volvo had. It lacks side impact air bags, but has crunch zones, anti-lock brakes, beams in the doors, pretensioners on the front seat belts, and second generation air bags. There are LATCH retainers for child seats in all positions. 

Quality and Reliability 

Quality was a major consideration. Zukes historically have not done as well in the J.D. Power comparisons, but the extension of the drive train warranty to seven years and the feel of this model may alleviate this consideration.  We've been surprised by the high initial quality for our 2002.  Again, it is made in Japan. 

At 5000 miles, we've had no problems whatsoever with our 2002. Everything is tight.  The only mystery noises have been traced to the rattle of coins in the convenient coin holder and a flapping seat belt which came unclipped momentarily from its nice side clip. 

Economy 

The signs on the XL-7 predicted 17 mpg city and 20 mpg highway driving. These predictions have been right on the button for our experience. 

Service and Reports of Other Owners 

We have kept track of other owners' experiences through Yahoo message boards. We have been gratified by the reports of dealer and manufacturer attempts to address the few reported problems. For example, one owner reported that the finish had deteriorated, and Suzuki replaced the vehicle (after 7000 miles). Another owner reported a low-level noise. Suzuki did many things to try to satisfy this owner, including replacment of the rear differential. 

Suzuki also has a program that authorizes certain experienced dealers with good records to approve warranty claims. 

Parts can be delayed, given Suzuki's small market and the manufacture in Japan. Suzuki has recently opened a parts facility in Pennsylvania to address delays. 

Conclusion 

In sum, the 2003 XL-7 is certainly a vehicle to consider along with the smaller SUVs, especially if a seven-seater is desired, if one has a narrow driveway or garage, if one has budget limitations, or if one is interested in some true off-roading. I consider a good primary competitor to be the Volvo XC90.  I do think the XL-7 Limited handles cargo and passenger space more logically, and for much less money, than that vehicle, and is luxurious, solid, and safe.
