            I work as a registered nurse and needed a reliable economical car to use for my daily 104 mile round trip drive to work. Back in 1993 my husband and I shopped for weeks for the perfect car.  His emphasis was safety, mine was economy and reliability.  We finally agreed on a Saturn SL1 4 door sedan with manual shift. Because of driving the Pennsylvania turnpike we got the added features of cruise control and the power locks and power windows package. I think it cost us around $14,000.00.
I am very pleased with the performance of this car.  I have not changed jobs and I have never missed a day of work due to car problems.  The car has 220,000 miles on it and is still going strong. When it was new it got as high as 40 miles to the gallon with highway driving, now I get approximately 34 miles to the gallon.  This past year when it hit around 180,000 mile mark it started to use a little more oil than usual. It has needed very few repairs. I had the first serpentine belt replaced at around 100,000 miles and just had the second serpentine belt replaced at 190,000.  It still gives a smooth ride and goes very well through the snow.  There have been many times that I have gone around other cars stuck in the snow with my trusty little Saturn.  
It wouldn't be my first choice for a family car, although we have used it that way.  All three of our children fit in the backseat with minimal complaints. I would like to get a newer model as they have made the seats more comfortable and the console more user friendly.  The car has a tendency to be noisy.  I've heard that the newer models are quieter. If you are looking for a dependable economical car, look at the Saturn.  It keeps going and going and going. <br><br>
