            This is a great camera! It is so packed with features, including manual modes and panoramic photo-stitch software.  I would recommend to anyone. 

The only downsides are that on a 500$ unit, there should be a larger compact flash card. Also, You cannot use the larger type two cards on it so less storage.  The battery will run out before you get through a large card anyways, so it isn't that bad. Speaking of the battery, it is also quick to die so I recommend to get another one.

Okay, but this is supposed to be a positive review so I will stop with the cons. this unit is very easy to use. It shoots at the equivalent of ISO 100 film, so daylight shots are best, but the flash is quite impressive.  The whole camera is so compact that I carry it everywhere, and use it as a preview when I 'm shooting shots with my film camera to get a sense for the image before I waste the film.

The USB connection is lightening fast, and the software is very easy to use and never crashes. My father has a Kodak camera and it is bulky and difficult to use compared to this camera.

The zoom toggle did lock up on me, but I lubed it with a little grease and it is working perfectly now. Otherwise, it is quite durable.
