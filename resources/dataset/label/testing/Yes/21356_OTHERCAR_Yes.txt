            My wife and I purchased a new Camry after reading countless consumer reports and visiting endless numbers of dealerships. As you may well know, the Toyota Camry is one of Consumer Reports best rated compact cars.
After test driving one for the first time, it was easy to understand why. The Camry is an unbelievable car to drive. The ride is solid and almost noiseless. The Camry is also loaded with features. 4 wheel anti-lock brakes, air bags, an awesome six-speaker cd stereo, Michelin X one tires (these tires are $375 each and have a 100,000 mile tread wear warranty), and tons of other features. It's tough to find a car that feels right, in every way, in todays flooded automobile market. With a new baby on the way(we checked to see how easy it is to get a car seat in and out of the back), I have never felt so at ease or safe with purchasing a new car. I highly recommend the four cylinder engine over the six(save the extra money and reinvest into options that are not standard, you wont regret).
The best advice that I can offer about purchasing a new Camry is read the reviews and if you still don't believe everyone, take one for a test drive! 
(Can you believe that there is a panel under the hood that will melt and extinguish a fire in the event that one occurs in the engine!) <br><br>
