            I bought my 1999 Camry in September of 1998.  I had done significant research into all cars in this class before I made my decision. I test drove numerous other cars models and talked to several mechanics and prior Camry and competing brand owners.  In short, I really spent time on this purchase. 

I decided to buy the 4 cylinder Camry because I liked the way it rode and the fit and finish options available were just what I wanted.  I had read that the four cylinder wasn't peppy.  This is not my opinion.  For routine around town and highway driving it is more than good.  

I've now had the car approximately 15 months and I have never had even one issue with it.  It runs superbly, feels and looks great.  I am in love with the way it feels on the road.  It gets great gas mileage (approximately 25 miles per gallon on the road).  

I suggest you consider upgrading the radio/cassette somewhat.  I did (to the first level upgrade) and have been very satisfied with the quality of music in the car.  The car is very quiet (little road noise) and the quality of the stereo is very good.<br><br>
