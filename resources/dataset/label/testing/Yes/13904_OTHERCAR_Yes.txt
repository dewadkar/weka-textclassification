            I recently took a new job which requires quite a bit of traveling.  I was told by several family members and friends that I should get a more dependable car.  Everyone recommended that I get a Saturn.  I had never thought about a Saturn but at the same time I knew that I needed to get something more practical for my job.  I did have a convertible.  Lots of fun but not practical for my new job.
  I went to my local Saturn dealership and I looked around for a while and did not really find anything I liked and I was getting ready to leave when I saw the SC 1 and SC 2.  I thought they were really cute.  I looked at them for a while and then decided to test drive the SC 2.  I loved it.  I wanted to buy it that day but I had to deal with some trade in issues.  My fiance and I decided to trade his car in so he came down the next day and we bought the car.
I really like the car.  I love the third door feature!!!  It is wonderful for loading and unloading out of the back seat.  I can see that this would be very practical if you had kids as well.  I however do not.  The moon roof is an added bonus as well.  It is the convertible in me that did not quite want to leave.  It is a really nice car.
It also drives very nice.  Very smooth.  I have only had it for 3 months and already have over 8,000 miles on it but it still purrs like a kitten.  
The staff of Saturn is also wonderful.  I could not get over how customer oriented they are!!  I was very impressed.  
I think that this car is designed for a lot of different types of people.  People who are looking for something sporty but not too sporty, new drivers, people with children, older people.  Just about anyone would fit into this car nicely.  The SC2 was more practicle for me because of the more comfortable seats.  It is very nice.  Like I said I drive at least 3 hours a day for my job and I don't mind at all in my car.  Very comfortable and nice.<br><br>
