            This is my second Camry and I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone.  Except for expected repairs such as mufflers, brakes, wipers, etc. the vehicle is basically repair free. 

The windows were fogging up during rain and snow storms but after reading the vehicle manual the problem was resolved.
 
The first camry I owned had problems with their mufflers and some had need for body repair after about 6 years, but it appears the manufacture has resolved this problem in the new vehicles.  


The older camry (1989) is still being operated by a friend and is holding up well.  

The Camry provides a comfortable ride and gives you a sense of security because of its reliability and ease of driving.<br><br>
