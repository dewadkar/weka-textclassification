            We have had our 2000 Pontiac Grand Am for just over 3 months( due to totaling our previous vehicle) and I am completely happy. The ride is so 
smooth and it handles wonderful. I love the body style update and really 
wouldn't have considered this car w/o the body change. It is so much roomier than the older models. My co-worker owns an older one. The factory
issued stereo/cd player has great sound and the gas mileage is very good!
We paid $19,200.00 for ours, they are available at a cheaper price, but we
opted for the sport package. The set up in the car is very convenient(easy
to get to all features when driving) We also love the fold down to trunk 
rear seats, very handy. To sum it up, I have only great things to say about this great Pontiac product, keep up the good work Pontiac!<br><br>
