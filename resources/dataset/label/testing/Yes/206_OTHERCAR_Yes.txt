            Imagine that for 2004, FIAT picks-up the 1998 V10 Ferrari Formula 1 engine, slightly detunes it and begins to produces it in series in a new FIAT Spider for the price of a Porsche Boxster. If this would not be enough for one&#146s to become crazy and stole the first bank way to the nearest FIAT dealer, then Ferrari makes a car to be sold with this engine for little more dollars. Wow! That it looks (and is) incredible today was real and true in 1966-67.

The history of this car is not too known and is intricate as well as thrilling, so I&#146m going to expand me more than usually. This is one of my ever favorite cars (where it comes my nick) and you will find the Road Test as you continue reading below in the Part 2.

Part 1: When, who and why

The first road-going Ferrari ever with an engine mounted centrally was not in true a Ferrari, but a Dino (pronounced dee-no). The Dino brand was an homage of Enzo Ferrari to his son Dino, who died in 1956. This name was used first to appoint the small displacement competition V-6 engines, and sometimes the cars that used them. The Dino engine was designed by Vitorio Jano and Andrea Fraschetti, and had different configurations from the initial V65� to a V180�. It won two Formula One championships for Ferrari in 1958 and 1961, and was used successfully in Formula Two as well as in Sportcars racing. 

These were the days when Ferrari had grown from the small competition workshop of the early days into a real manufacturer. By 1961, it had around 300 employees, too much to Enzo Ferrari&#146s taste, who only built the road cars in order to fund the racing ones. As the racing costs were increasingly higher and higher, Enzo wanted to protect his racing program and his workers under the wing of a major manufacturer, and then began to talk with Ford. This was only a Machiavellian move in order to weak up interest in FIAT. Enzo, as well as a strong character, was a noticeable nationalist and never would have sold Ferrari to a foreign enterprise. As soon as FIAT was told of the Ferrari-Ford negotiation they had to put all the cards on the table, promising technical as well as financial support without conditions. Enzo was a genius.

So by 1965, when the new F-2 rules for 1966 stated that the engines had to be derived from a series production car built in a minimum of 500 units per year, the giant FIAT agreed to build 500 of these engines to be mounted in a new sporting FIAT, so Ferrari could continue racing their F-2&#146s. The Dino engine, in the 2000 c.c. V65� form, was detuned for road use by Aurelio Lampredi, who complained about the torsional rigidity of the light competition alloy-made block. The result was an exquisite front-engined two seater roadster with a Pininfarina body, the FIAT Dino 2000 Spider, but this is another story.

Meanwhile, Ferrari made the most of this, designing for 1967 a new road car specifically for this FIAT-supplied engine, that would be a cheaper Ferrari under the Dino 206 GT designation in a great marketing move. It would be in the 911 class for its weight, capacity and price, as well as been the first mid-engined fully road car for the modenese factory, and nobody will complain of been only 6-cilinder because it was (theoretically) not a Ferrari. The body was drawn by Aldo Brovarone of Pininfarina following a pair of earlier Dino prototypes, and for my taste, remains one of the greatest shapes ever made. By the time the engine capacity grew to 2,418 cc. in the &#147246&#148 model, and remained so until ended production in 1974.

Part 2: The Road Test

How I remember this one. I meet for first time with this very Dino 246 GT at the age of 11 or 12 years old. It was a Fly Yellow &#147Chairs and Flairs&#148 example (the one with Daytona seats and 7-inch wheels) and it was parked over the sidewalk near my school. Funny days those of the early eighties! It impressed me greatly as I never had seen one before, with its very low height and its sculpted profile, the big arched front wings and, above all things, the strange &#147Dino&#148 script over a yellow rectangle. It was an unknown brand at that age for me, a nut fan nevertheless. Many years after, I found it back by chance lying under a cover in a  friend&#146s garage. It was a child&#146s dream come true, as I beg him to go out for a ride.

Interior

The car is, as told, very low with only 113 cm high. The door opens wide but it has not got any built-in stop trough its travel and you have to hold it even when fully opened, so for fast entrance and exit you must rehearsal a little. The interior is bright and the visibility outside superb for a mid-engined car, better than in a 308/328 and much better than in a De Tomaso Pantera or a Lamborghini Miura. You can actually see rearwards as well as rear three-quarters, due to the genial design of the rear side screens that blends almost into one with the rear one. 

The pedal layout is slightly off center and you will find the footrest where you expect to find the clutch pedal, however it is good and you can heel and toe without difficult. Another matter is the position and angle of the steering wheel. It is almost too close to the pedals, and every position you could find is a compromise. It is common of period Italian cars, and if has been attributed to the standard short legs/long arms Italian body, somebody once told me that is because the Italians hold the steering wheel for its bottom&#133 

All the main dials are placed in a receptacle directly in front of your eyes and are easy to read. However the rev counter most important sector (from 6000 to 8000) is obscured by the steering wheel because this is smaller than the original one from the Dino 206 GT for which it was designed the fascia. 

At the wheel

The steering effort is a little in the heavy side, as well as the clutch, brake and throttle pedals and gearshift. The engine starts with a high-pitched whine, and sounds incredible. For me it is even better (I&#146m sorry) than a V-12. This scream by itself is the raison d&#146�tre of the car, like the voice of a singer or an actress. It is very loud and remains with you even time after you have stopped it.

Under 3500 rpm there is no much punch, only the necessary to begin the movement of the car and cruising and nothing else. From 3500 to 6000 it comes alive changing the sound from a sharp bark to a loud whine, along with a more gentle push, and from 6000 screams all the way to 7500 very easily, delivering all its power enthusiastically. In the 2000 cc Dinos there is another sharp band until 8200 that yowls like what it is, a F1 engine, but is missed in the 2400 cc engine that in contrast to has more low-end torque. Don&#146t be wrong, this is not a very powerful engine by today standards at only 195 hp, but is a very enjoyable one, and once accustomed to the slick gear change one can travel very fast on winding roads as well as on the highway. This engine has an oddity in that has soul, and make sure I would change power for soul in the whole of today&#146s cars. 

Road Behavior

I told that you can travel very fast&#133yes it is true. The steering is accurate as well as not extremely direct, so you can steer the car with a flick of the wheel and still get sensibility in straight line. In a slow to medium range bend the trend is to run nose wide, not in excess but noticeably, when entering without braking or with moderate throttle, but can be corrected easily with power-induced oversteer. The transition is even and the feeling is that the line tightens a little just to stay in a neutral behavior. This is no car of brute power and mass transfer, it is delicate, and reacts to inputs with nobility. 

In faster bends there is less drama, but the grip level is not as high as in a modern sporting car and all four tires slip at once at steady throttle. Once more, there is no much problem as it is only a gentle opening of the line that could be corrected lifting the throttle a little. Is a rewarding car to drive, one that makes you feel a great driver, with no vices, no sting in the tail, but nor is forgiving. It responds right to the right inputs, but wrong to the wrong ones.

I don&#146t remember anything special about the brakes, so they are correct for the weight of the car, and don&#146t have any difficult in being modulated with precision. 

Summary

Here it is the optimum classic sport car. Is an expensive car but not a very expensive one as some period stablemates, it has power and grip to enjoy but not too much to overwhelm you, and is very beautiful but no ostentatious. And you never get tired of listen to that engine. It is no mystery why its price has climbed steadily year after year. The only problem is that actually I can&#146t afford one. Luck I&#146ve got a great friend&#133

Dino has grown and is a mature Ferrari today.
