                My 1992 Toyota Paseo was my first real car. My dad is a car sales manager, so we did get it wholesale, but it wasn't cheap still. It fits my personality and looks sporty and still looks newish, which is why I actually agreed with my dad on having it. 
    I love how it looks. It is so cute! Mine is a really pretty light blue, and it still has great interior, and a really good sound system for a car factory one. It is extremely easy to drive, and I actually feel safe and confident driving it. There isn't much room in the back seat, so you can't haul around a lot of people, but it works for me! Mine has a sunroof, but it doesn't go all the way back, it just lifts up, so that isn't all that great, but hey it still has one!
    I think this is a great car for teenagers, because it is easy to drive and is fun to drive! You can see really well out of it, and it looks new. The price isn't all that bad either!
