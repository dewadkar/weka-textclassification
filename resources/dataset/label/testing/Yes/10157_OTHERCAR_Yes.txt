            I recently purchased a 2000 4x4 super black Nissan Pathfinder with tan leather interior.  I shopped and shopped around for an SUV and all of them were so expensive.  I finally showed up at a Nissan dealer one day and fell in love.  I decided to get every option on the car just because the financing was great at the time.  I had a hard time deciding if I should get the SE (sports edition) or LE(limited edition).  

The SE has a more sporty rugged look with a two tone exterior, its honeycomb grill, wheels, and tubular running boards.  The LE is more stream line with its single tone exterior, grill, wheels, running boards, digital a/c, and wood trim.  The truck really does drive like a car though.  It is very quiet and has a cool stereo system and CD player.  

One thing about the car that I don't really like is the engine is fairly small and it is hard to look over your shoulder to see traffic.  I was interested in the new Jeeps for awhile because of the engine, but they are so expensive.  I am very glad I purchaced the Pathfinder and I think it at least deserves a test drive from every potential SUV driver before they spend 40,000-50,000 on another SUV.<br><br>
