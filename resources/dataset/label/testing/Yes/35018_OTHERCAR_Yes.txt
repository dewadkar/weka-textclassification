            My wife purchased a 98 Hombre extended cab. This is the first time I have bought a car other than a GM or Ford. I was pleasantly surprised. The small pick-up is quite comfortable. We spent three days traveling from Arizona to Missouri. We were amazed to get out of the Hombre without a backache. Although we did take the usual breaks along the way, we never felt overly stiff from the long ride. Mechanically, the Hombre has performed well for us. The first leak I noticed was the thermostat housing at 30,000 miles. Service was scheduled and handled quick and efficiently. My wife travels a great deal in her job and finds the Hombre a reliable vehicle to date. The five speed manual transmission is easy to operate for a man or woman. The dashboard is easy to read and has a low gas warning that comes in handy.
One draw back of the truck from my standpoint is the view is a bit obscured when backing up. I can not see completely around all sides of the Hombre due to the framing around the windows of the extended cab.
Another feature that is on many of the newer vehicles is an automatic light sensor for the headlights. I do not care to have my headlights on whenever I start the car. I find the auto-sensor a real pain when I stop in a parking lot with the truck running. I have to place the parking brake on to keep the lights off. I prefer the control of the vehicle in my hands, not the sensors.
Over all, I would recommend the Hombre for the average family. It would not work as a large family car or a heavy duty work truck, but suffices as a two or three member family vehicle. We had a cap put on the back for the trip to Missouri. Our black lab felt right at home.<br><br>
