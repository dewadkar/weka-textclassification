            I did a lot of research before I purchased the Sony MVC FD-91.  I am not sorry at all.  This camera is remarkable.  I can take stills, normal or email mode and I can also take movies.  Just yesterday, an accident happened at my home, where an elderly gentleman jumped the curb, hit my son's car and completely wiped out my 18' pine tree that was decorated for Christmas with numerous sets of lights.  He also got my fence &amp; gate.  The tree fell in such a manner that I could not get to my front door, so I went around to the back, got my camera and took pictures of the accident scene.  I took stills of the scene, but I also took shots of the elderly gentleman walking with his walker in the movie mode.  I then called his insurance company and sent them the pictures on the computer.  They viewed the pictures and telephoned that I could move the tree immediately.  The tree was then moved away from my entrance so I could have the use of my front door. All this took less than 1/2 hour.  Had I not had the camera, I would probably still have that tree at my entrance!  This is just one instance where a camera with both modes came in handy.  This camera is very easy to use and one feature that I really like is you have a viewfinder for taking pictures, as well as the screen for playback. I would purchase an extra battery, especially if you are going to be away from an electrical source for any length of time.  Sony has now come out with a carrying case exclusively for this model and I intend to purchase it.  I also like being able to delete bad shots immediately and retake the picture if needed.  Great feature!  A lot of camera for the price.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants the movie mode, especially new parents.  It will save on film and developing and you have two cameras in one.<br><br>
