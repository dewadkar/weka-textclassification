            i just purchased this camera to use at work for safety and theft investigations. i really surprised when i got it out of the box and went to install the software to my computer. the program does all the work for you. you just need to choose some options and sit back and watch and click your mouse. when it was done, i rebooted the computer for a clean start and everything worked fine. i was using the camera in about fifteen minutes. i was able to set the time and date, format and select the style photograph i wanted to take and away i went. the only thing i discovered was the small memory chip that comes with it. (4 megabytes) a 64 megabyte card is available. the box comes with everything (i mean everything) to get started. it can be used on macintosh or ibm compatible(pcs). if you want a camera that is small and takes excellent pictures then this one's for you.<br><br>
