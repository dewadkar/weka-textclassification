            I bought this vehicle because I couldn't find anything that I liked better.  I love the leather interior, it is the nicest I've seen in a vehicle under $100,000.  I love the air suspension and the fact that you can raise and lower the entire truck from a button inside.  I hate the fact that the back seat has less legroom than their older long wheel base model that was discontinued in 1995, but it is still better than any of the other suvs I've been in.  Driving this vehicle is a pleasure.  It has so many automatic things that it does.  It self levels and raises/lowers itself according to your speed.  It has all the normal gadgets (built in garage door opener, sunroof, rearview mirror dims when bright lights are behind, great stereo system,and on and on...).  And the snob appeal? no one else can touch it.  However, if you think you can ALMOST afford its $65,000 price tag, don't get it.  Repairs are EXPENSIVE and believe me YOU WILL HAVE THEM.  To me its worth it, but this is a high maintenance vehicle and you have to accept that from the start.<br><br>
