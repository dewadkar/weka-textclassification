            I was in love with the PT Cruiser from the minute I saw a picture of it in a magazine in Fall of 99.  I love old cars, and seeing something so retro looking  yet so new, really appealed to me.  I immediately went online to find out more information on this car, and e-mailed the PT Cruiser website photos to all my family and friends.  I was the only one though, who thought this car looked awesome - everyone else thought it was ugly or weird looking!  Of course they changed their tune when they started seeing them on the road.I couldn't wait to see this car in person, and was disappointed when they didn't arrive at dealers in the Spring of 2000 as they were supposed to.  Of course once they did start arriving you couldn't get near one to test drive it anyways - you couldn't even sit in one!  When I did finally see one for myself, I will admit I was disappointed - but only in it's size.  I had it in my mind that this vehicle was actually a full size SUV due to the versatility of it - similar to a Jimmy GMC or Chevy Blazer, so I was floored when I saw it was smaller and rode lower.  But I still loved the way it looked!  Between the aggravation of trying to get to test drive one, the fact you had to order one, the fact it's not 4WD (which I am very accustomed to having) and the fact that it's an American made car (which I have never had luck with) and a Chrysler to boot, I convinced myself this vehicle was no longer worth pursuing so close to the end of my current lease, which is up in November. I resigned myself to the fact that I would have to get a different vehicle, even though there was nothing else out there that interested me in the least!  On Friday, October 13th, I went to Toyota, nothing tickled me.  I went to Nissan, although their deals were better than Toyota, I was having a hard time picking a vehicle.  Although I had narrowed my choices to a 2001 Xterra or a 2001 Frontier Crew Cab, my heart wasn't in it and I left the dealership to mull my selections over. On my way home, I spotted one single PT Cruiser sitting on a lot with no info on it.  I enquired about it, found it was for sale, but also found the dealer was a price gouger asking $25,500 for it.  I declined and went on my way.  When I got home I made a few last calls to a couple of dealers in hopes of possibly still being able to snag one.  I finally got an offer to test drive one, and was told they had one on order that a customer cancelled and was due in about 4 to 6 weeks - perfect I thought! I said I would be down in the morning to test drive it, although the price was still too high at $23,800 I felt I was getting closer!Lo and behold Saturday the 14th, the phone rings at 9:00 am and it's a different dealer saying a customer cancelled, the car was there on the lot and they would sell it for $20,500 with immediate delivery.  They told me to come down and drive it, and I raced right down there!I have read a lot of opinions on this car and was glad to finally get the chance to find out for myself, which opinions were right.  The blind spots I read about, I didn't notice them, and saw nothing wrong with the size of the side and rearview mirrors. The low engine power was something else I didn't notice, maybe that's because I'm used to a 4 cylinder to begin with.  I imagine if you're going from a 6 or 8 cylinder to a 4 cylinder you would definitely notice a power difference.  I test drove a 5 speed manual and found no hesitation or delays in power as stated with the automatics.  I drove a very rough, curvy road and I was quite pleased with the way the PT Cruiser handled the bumps and curves, and there was no rattling either. And although the car appears to sit so low, I didn't feel like I was riding right on the ground as I expected to.  The view of the road is good and you feel higher up than you do in cars. but not as high as in a 4WD vehicle.All in all, I was quite pleased, in fact so pleased I bought the PT Cruiser! I take delivery Tuesday the 17th and I can't wait.  I just hope I don't regret my choice come snow season!One last note - don't try to lease one of these cars!I almost fell off my chair when they showed me the payment.  I went in with the intention of leasing this vehicle and ended up buying it instead.  Chrysler needs to get their act together in the Lease Program area, if they don't they'll lose a lot of deals on this car.<br><br>
