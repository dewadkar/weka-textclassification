            My wife and I bought this car at the end of our senior year in college because we were so impressed by its track record.  Great customer service and smart design helped us make our decision.  Let me tell you up front some things to look for though.

1.) No haggle pricing is a crock.  You end up paying more than the car is worth because they do not &quot;deal&quot; at Saturn dealerships.  Plus, they get you in with enticing base prices and expensive option packages.

2.) The extended warranty is a terrible idea.  The standard warranty is for 3 years/36,000 miles, plenty of time for something to fall off or break.  We bought the extended warrany under pretense that it was bumper to bumper.  WRONG!  There are more exceptions in the fine print than there are things covered.  Our breaks began to shake about the 38,000 mile mark and we took it in to have it fixed. . .they said it would be $200+ to fix and that rotors were not covered under warranty.  Funny, I had my Honda Accord for 14 years and never had rotor problems.

3.) The stock tires are firestones and have a tendancy to squeek easily and hydroplane.  

4.) The speaker upgrade system is worth having!  Infiniti speakers rock!

Overall we are happy with the saturn (with the exception of items 1-3 above).  The polymer body is very nice and does not show age at ALL.  The pickup is awesome for a 4-cylinder manual transmission.  Its 16-valve dual overhead cams really rocket this car off the line.  The center console can be hard to get used to (mirror and window conrol are there) and the glove compartment is the perfect size for all important documents, ibuprofen, breath mints, hairbrush, napkins, writing utensils, and space for more.  The air conditioner can get overwhelmed by city driving, but it will freeze you out on the interstate.  

The car is very open and has no blind spots (that I have noticed).  It handles very well (with the exception of occasional tire noise, see point 3 above) and has a tight turn radius.

For a family car, the SL2 still looks really sharp (especially if you get the spoiler, it makes a big difference).  The back seat folds completely down, giving full access to the spacious trunk.  We have 2 dogs and use this feature whenever we travel to maximize their space in the back seat. You can also fit a lot more stuff in the back/trunk whenever you move or go on a long vacation (personal experiences abound).

Only other thing is the interior.  Looks really great at first, but is cheaply made and has a tendancy to wear fast, especially around the doors and headrests.<br><br>
