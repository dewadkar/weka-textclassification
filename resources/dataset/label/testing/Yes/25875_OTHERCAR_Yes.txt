            I love my Jeep. I bought my Jeep in January of 1998. It had 118,000 miles on it and was running great. I have drove this Jeep EVERYWHERE and with 2 kids that can be MANY places. 
 I loved this Jeep having 2 children in car seats because it was easier to get them in and out with the seats being so high up I didn't have to lean over to get them out.
 The only thing I HATE about this Jeep is there is not much room in the back seat and the back doors are VERY small. There is not much leg room for adult passengers in the back but great for kids. I have a hard time getting in and out of the back seat when I ride back there and my 6'4&quot; husband cannot even attempt to ride in the back seat.
 Though there is TONS of space in the very back for our double stroller and even more so that is a definite PLUS!! I would recommend someone w/ younger children to buy this jeep but anyone w/ a child old enough to sit w/out a car seat ...there just may not be enough room.<br><br>
