            I recently upgraded vehicles from a 1989 jeep cherokee with a 6 inch lift and AWSOME off-roading capabilitys to a 1996 Chevy 1500 x-cab z-71.  Well, the first thing i noticed is that this truck is LONG!  It has the turning radius of a semi, but thats expected for such a big truck.(WATCH OUT, CHEVY IS PUTTING ALL WHEEL STEERING ON THEIR TRUCkS FOR 2003)  I have had to adjust my parking habits since getting this train for a truck.  Now, if you dont like having a long vehicle, then oh well.  I absolutley LOVE this truck.  The engine runs like its brand new, and the suspension is soft enough to give you a comfortable ride anywhere you go, but still capable of hauling a load.  The 5.7 litre Vortec engine really gets this 6500 pound beast up to speed faster than you would think.  And heres the really cool part.....the highway gas mileage is AMAZING for a v-8.  I just moved cities and took a 130 mile drive.  Well, i went through a mere 6 gallons of gas (for those of you who are too tired or lazy to do the math, thats 20 mpg)  I can only imagine it would go up if you put a topper or a toneu cover on it.  The 6.5 foot bed provieds enough space to fit a whole LOT of cargo, and the extra cab fits 5 people easily when the front people move their seats up just a bit.  Underneath the back seat you there is probably enough room to fit a 10 inch subwoofer which would really pound in a small cab like that.  The stereo was the only thing i was disapointed with.  For some reason, GM has been putting Delco radios and cd players and tape decks in ALL of their cars for the past who knows how many years.  These stereos dissapoint me with their ugly looks and low quality sound.  The first thing i did was go out and get an aftermarket cd player for it.  Read my other article on the Kenwood Excelon 4.5v CD player.  KEX-715.  Now my truck sounds great, looks great, and rides great.  Its a perfect vehicle for almost anyone who can park something long and needs the cargo space ocasionally.<br><br>
