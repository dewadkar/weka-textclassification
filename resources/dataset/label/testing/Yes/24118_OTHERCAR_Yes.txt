            I currently own a 1991 Acura Legend, and I must say it is by far the best car I have had.  I've gone through several cars over the years, and the Acura is the only one that has lasted for more than three.  Nine years ago I purchased my Legend and it is still in great shape today!  The car drives smoothly and takes the sharp turns with ease. The steering wheel, brake and accelerator are all perfect: not too hard and not too soft.  And, I must admit, this car has the durability of a tank! After several incidental collisions it has survived with small scratches.  The car has 105,000 miles on it and the only thing I have had to replace is the radiator (which apparently blew up). It has great pickup, so it will please the men with that need-for-speed.  The car is very roomy for a four door sedan, and can fit 3 comfortably in the back.

The worst thing about this car, I must say, is that it has zero cup holders, making it rather difficult to enjoy a long drive.

Unfortunately, this model has been discontinued, or else I would recommend it to anyone who wants a dependable car with some style.  However, the newer models are just as good as the Legend, and probably better.

The Acura Legend is a car you can depend on.<br><br>
