            Saab Aero 9-5 2003

A Swedish-American Innovation

A few years ago General Motors took full control of Saab. Until then General Motors was a co-owner of this European automobile manufacturer.

Looking for quick results and increase production over the 100,000 cars Saab were manufacturing up till then GM knew it had to make some changes, and some changes they did.

I rented a Saab Aero during a recent trip in Europe, the choice of car from the rental company was varied but I wanted to rent one that I could compare with a previous model that I had driven. So I selected the new Saab Aero 9-5 2003.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Saab Aero 9-5 2003.

As soon as one looks at this car&#146s exterior you immediately know that it is a European automobile. Sitting behind the steering wheel re-affirm your first impression, the interior of the Saab Aero 9-5 has all the characteristics of a European built car. 

What are those indications? Well for starter the ignition is located on the front seat console, instead of the steering column as for American automobiles. Most of us, who ever owned a European car, know that the interior leather has a special smell that can only be smelled in a European car and it is present in the Aero 9-5. 

There are several other indications that lets you know you are sitting behind the wheel of a non-American car but it would take too long to explain. So here is a better description.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

Now you want a classy interior? This is one. Now we could talk of day about the comfort behind the wheel with the adjustable steering column, than comes to mind the easy accessible controls and highly visible gauges.   

Now lets talk about the cup holder that pops out with a single touch, and about the refrigerated seats. Yes you read correctly a fan refrigerates the front seats so that the leather does not stick to your body like glue.

Now here is another fantastic innovation, the floor in the rear of the 9-5 will slide toward you in order for you to either easily deposit or retrieve any piece of cargo you want.  

The interior of this automobile is quite exceptional, and it does not matter whether you are sitting in the back or the front cabin of the Aero 9-5, you will be very comfortable.

The exterior:

It is true that looking at the Saab Aero 9-5 2003 exteriors may not be a revelation in itself. Knowing first of all that it is a Swedish product should let you right away that you will not get the fancy appearance of a BMW or a Mercedes. 

This is exactly what is one of the charms of this auto; it does not &#147Scream look at me!&#148 for attention. Anyone who knows about cars will know that this a superior automobile and that&#146s it nothing else needs to be said.  

THE ROAD TEST

Well nothing is perfect; the Aero is a great car to drive around town but on the highway it is a bit noisy. You can hear a whistling sound coming from the front. I could not tell if it came from the windshield or the doors. In case it was just a problem with my rental, I looked it up on the Internet and there it was, there have been problems at that level.

Aside from a little excessive noise over 100 kilometer per hour (60 MPH), the Saab Aero rides very well. Its front wheel drive traction hugs the road and corners like a luxury automobile.

I particularly like how you have an excellent all around vision in this car. The front and rear windows are well positioned and the outside mirrors give you a very small dead spot.  

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

The engine: 412.3 liters, 16-valve turbo. Developing 230 HP.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

This is the second time I drove a Saab; the first time was about 7 years ago as a designated driver. Quite useless my brother-in-law crashed is Saab the following week any way.
