              I bought my two door, soft top, '99 Chevy Tracker in August when it was sunny and warm outside. Now it's winter and I'm wondering why I didn't op for the four door. Not just because I can't take the top off, but also because of the lack of room in the two door. True the seats fold down in the back very easily, but don't expect this to mean that you can get away with packing up a dorm room and going home for Christmas. Which is the mistake I recently made. I do like the look to my tracker, definitely fun and cute. But not something that will be with me for the rest of my life, unless I make enough money to buy a family car and keep the fun one. I like the fact that there is enough room to fit three other people in the tracker besides yourself, though maybe not as comfortably as it could be. Oh, and if you have tall friends you will hear complaints. As for loudness via the top, it's not that bad at all. You do have to watch out for the top popping out of place every once and awhile. You will know when that happens because it REALLY gets loud. It does lack some power, so don't expect to get out in front of traffic and go without someone having to slam on their brakes. The gas mileage is incredible though. I use to have a 454, so this car is a dream to me. It gets about 25-28mpg. I'm not sure if I would take it off road too far, of course it's new to me and I'm not looking to wreck it. The other day I did get to try out the 4 wheel drive on the fly and was very impressed. It did excellent in the snow and over the pass. I have to cross the mountains again in Jan. so I'll let you know if there are any changes seeing as how there will be more snow and ice then. One thing you will need to know is that you will have to buy the little round stick on mirrors for the sides mirrors. The blind spot is the worst I've ever seen. Get the mirrors and it will be fine.  <br><br>
