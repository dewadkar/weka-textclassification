            This opinion is based on my test drive in a stock Honda Civic si, Nissan Sentra SE, and an Acura Integra GSR.

I'm in the market for a new car as is everyone else with a checkbook in America.  I ran by the Nissan and Honda dealers in my area to test drive the 2000  Nissan Sentra SE, Acura Integra GSR and Honda Civic si.  The reason why I chose these three models with those specific trims is because I speed.  Yes, I speed, as well as many other college students who don't have the money to buy Supras and Lexus IS300's.  These models are ideal for any import enthusiast because of their mechanical capabilities for speed and get 31 miles to the gallon.

I'll rate the three cars according only upon my impression during the test drives.

Nissan Sentra SE: Of the three, this is the most refined.  The sport bucket seats allowed my body to mold to it's pre-set shape.  The instrument panels are large and easy to reach.  This car shifted very well and the torque made it easy for me to pass a slower moving Buick on the freeway.  Is this car a Sentra or a Maxima?  Kind of hard to tell with all the interior room and elbow space.  Compared to the 93 Sentra that I currently drive today, this car easily put a smile upon my face with improvements on every level and detail.  The major drawback to the Sentra is how ugly it is.  I can't stand how ugly my 93 is, but to spend $16k on a 2000 that doesn't do any better in appearance is not a good consumer decision, so I passed on it.

Acura Integra GSR: I'd have to pass on the Integra because the 2000 is hardly ever different than a 99 or 98 when it comes to acceleration, appearance and resale value.  Test driving the Integra didn't come as a surprise to me because it behaves just like the 98 my friend drives.  Compared to the 98, this car felt faster, yet if you compare the numbers between both years it's insignificant.  Despite the fact that it's similar to the 98, the Integra was my favorite to test drive.  Mike, the salesperson, was riding in the passenger seat was obviously nervous when I redlined it all the way up to 110 mph on I-90.  The Integra is in one word awesome.  But, the 2000 model is so similar to the 98 in the way it behaves, that my $23k would be better spent on a 98 with money left over for upgrades.

Honda Civic si: This is the car for me.  160hp DOHC Vtec engine rings like a sweet song in my head. $18k for a car that appeared in Sport Compact Car's top 8 rides two years in a row is definitely a something to ponder before signing on the dotted line.  Although the Civic was not as aggressive as the Integra, or as refined and smooth as the Sentra, it felt right.  What felt right about this car is that it behaves similarly to the Integra, yet looks as civilized as the Sentra.  I didn't get to 110 mph on I-90, as I did on the Integra, but it satisfied my appetite for speed.  One thing that I hated about the Civic was the interior.  It could be that I am so used to the interiors of Nissans, but the Civic's interior displeased me.  The color of the instrument flashed a dull red when the headlights were engaged.

Overall, despite the red light on the guages, the Civic would be the best choice of these three vehicles.  Test drive one today.<br><br>
