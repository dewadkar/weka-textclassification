            I've been more than impressed with this econo-fun car. I purchased a 1997 Golf Trek edition primarily for commuting. I've put over 45,000 miles on it without a single quality issue. Maintenance has thus far consisted of oil changes. My gas mileage has met or exceeded the highway estimate of 31 mpg. In the spring and fall when I do not need the A/C, I get as high as 35 mpg. In the middle of summer, using A/C constantly, I get 30. Power is respectable with the manual transmission. I would not recommend an automatic for this car (or any other compact car for that matter), unless you absolutely can't drive a stick and don't want to learn.

This car is so fun to drive with a terrific stereo and other features that I've had several friends make serious offers to buy this car from me even though it was never for sale.

Even the tires are still original. The tread left suggests I should get about 50,000 miles on them, which is far more than I've ever gotten on any HR rated tires.

The Trek model came with a $500 Trek VW limited edition mountain bike and a roof rack that can be adapted for skis, snowboards, etc. It also has upgraded seats and upholstery, silver on black gauges, blacked out taillights and rocker panels and 5-spoke mag rims. In all, it looks like a 4-door GTI.<br><br>
