            The Dodge Durango is a GREAT vehicle.  Big, roomy, V8, seats 8, fun to drive, eye catching, we are very pleased with this model.  I have spoken at length with our dealership Service Manager who assures me there have been very few service problems with this model, and customer satisfaction among owners is very high.

If you like attention, this is a good choice for you! Every time we go out in our Durango we are approached by people who want to admire it or ask questions.  It is a real attention-getting machine!

A perfect choice for a family, this car is practical and fun at the same time.  We highly recommend the Durango!<br><br>
