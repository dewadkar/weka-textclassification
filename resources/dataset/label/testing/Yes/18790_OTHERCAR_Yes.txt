            My Kia Sephia has been a nightmare. In the past 5 weeks, it has been in the shop 7 times (the car is barely 2 years old). I have started a website detailing my experience and collecting other horror stories from unsatisfied Kia owners. Please have a look before you consider buying a Kia car. The address of the website is:

As you will see on the website, the number of unsatisfied Kia owners is stagering. Kias seems to be plagued by bad brakes, poor workmanship, check engine light constantly coming on, etc. Many, many people have had to resort to the lemon law because of all the problems they have had with their Kias. Kias also has one of the lowest scores in crash tests and it received on of the worst reviews ever published in Consumer Reports.

I STRONGLY recommend that you do not buy a Kia or let anyone you know buy a Kia.<br><br>
