            We bought a Kodak DC-280 to bring on our recent trip to Italy. 
I love it. Its compact size and easy-to-use design made it a snap to take pictures.  Maybe it was a little too easy, because I'm still sifting through them and we've been back for several weeks.  It is capable of high-resolution images at a reasonable price.  And, it looks like a regular 35 mm camera, making it a little less appealing to would-be pickpockets.

The retail kit came with a 24 MB Compact Flash card, a set of alkaline batteries, a set of rechargeable batteries, and a battery charger.  
We didn't get an adapter for it, but I wish that we had. 
As with many digital cameras, the Kodak sucks up a lot of electricity. 
Another con is the location of the LCD display on the back. I seemed to put many thumbprints there. 

In spite of those drawbacks, I love the flexibility of the DC-280 and I'm really glad we got it in time for our vacation.  Instead of spending my time waiting for the negatives to get developed, I've been able to sort through the images and send them to family and friends via email.
