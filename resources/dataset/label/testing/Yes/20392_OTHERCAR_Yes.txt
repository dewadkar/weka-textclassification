            As it was time to lease a new car, I ran into the problem of finding a quality car for a decent price.  The quality and luxury between a car worth about 20 grand and 28,000 can be a big gap.  I wanted a car with some power and pickup, but also loaded on the interior.  

Volkswagen has put together a car with tons of features in many parts of the car; all nice touches.  Ill start with the interior of the car.  
Interior
The interior of the car is very nice looking.  It has a very clean look to it, available in black with gray, black or tan highlights.  The seats are available in cloth or velour.  I chose the velour.  It has a very nice texture and doesnt heat up too bad when the car sits in the heat.  The seats are firm but comfortable.  There is a heat seater option which I chose to buy.  Should work well in the winter although i havent tried it yet.  The seats do not feature power movement, as they use a handle underneath with slide action.  The handle is pretty small which ensures no discomfort with your legs hitting the bar as found in other cars.    

Sound System
For sound, I opted to buy the monsoon sound system with the car.  This 200 watt system is very powerful, featuring the amplifier which is hidden in a side panel in the trunk.  When you turn it on, it displays monsoon written on the display for 2 seconds, then goes to the radio display.  The car does not come with a cd player but a single or 6 disc is available.  The 6 cd changer goes in the back.  When changing stations or tracks, the sound system "fades" off when going into the next station.  Very cool. 

Displays:
Everything in the interior is neatly layed out in front of you. When turning on the lights, the panel is lit up in bright blue and red for the radio.  

Trunk Space, seat removal
This is one of the neatest features of the car.  The rear seats completely fold down to give more trunk space.  In addition, the seat bottoms unfold, so it is completely flat, and they double as headrest holders.  Now there is a significant amount of space.  Also in the trunk is a 12v power outlet connected to the battery.  As mentioned before, the amplifier is also located here.  Found in the trunk is a full size spare and tools.  My only complaint about the trunk space is the width.  In my previous car (subaru legacy sedan) I was able to lay a set of golf clubs in the trunk.  In the golf, they barely fit if i angle them at a 45 degree angle.  Its not a huge problem, but it shows how narrow the trunk is. 

Exterior:
The car is very aesthetically pleasing from the outside.  Its a very nice looking compact car.  On the outside, the car feature heated washer fluid for winter, if you get the cold weather package.  My car is a 4 door golf.  The car is also available in a 2 door model.  When speaking to the guys at the dealership, they informed me that this is one of the last years that they will be making the 4 door model.  With the luxury package, a sunroof and 5 spoke alloy wheels are added.  The 5 spokes are decent, but arent anything special.  The trunk automatically locks when closed, and cant be reopened without the keyless entry, or by using the key.  

Driving the car:
This car has very nice pickup.  The engine is a 1.8 liter turbo engine which has 150 hp.  For the size of the car being very small, this provides more than enough power.  There is a slight delay once you lay on the gas, and the 4 speed automatic transmition shifts smoothly.  I did not buy the sport suspension, but the car still handles fine.  Its a little shaky and tipsy when taking turns too fast, but still handles great.  Im sure the stiffer sport suspension would be a nice option.  The car is also very quiet and smooth due to the precise suspension.  Its a very soft ride.  Braking power is very touchy.  It took me a little while to get used to the brakes on this car.  One complaint is the size of the brake pedal.  Compared to my subaru, the pedal is tiny. Probably about 60% of the size.  This took a little getting used to as I, "missed" the pedal a couple of times.  I'm contemplating on buying some clip on carbon fiber/aluminum gas and brake pedals.  

Driving this car has been a pleasure.  Loaded with features inside and out, the car is a great value when looking at its competition.  From heated seats, a sunroof, alloy wheels, and side and front airbags, this car has it all.  It features a great engine, built with volkswagen and audi parts that runs great and gets good mileage.  When my cars lease runs out, it will definaltey be a tough decision on whether or not to give it up.
