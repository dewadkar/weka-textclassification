            It was a long time coming in being able to purchase a brand new car.  But we were finally able to do this after 12 years of waiting.  We test drove all kinds of makes and models for months, prior to deciding on this extremely good looking car.  My husband fell in love with it more than I did, I guess it was the sporty look, yet classy, plus he was excited about it having a sports shift transmission!
Well, what does not mean, for us simple car minded people like me, it means you can decide if you want to drive the car in manual or stick shift!  And, to my husband that sounded like a fun way to get behind the wheel and go cruising, especially where we live.  It's full of streets and highways that curve this way and that. You can't go anywhere without going up hill and down hill.  So, to him that was an ingenious idea!
Well, the car had no problems, only regular maintenance, up until it was a little over two years old.  Then it was the wheel bearings, and soon after that it was the axial.  Thank goodness we bought the extended warranty, or we would of been in big trouble.  At least we didn't have to fork out any money for these repairs, so now that it's in great shape again, lets just keep knocking on wood and shifting those fun gears!<br><br>
