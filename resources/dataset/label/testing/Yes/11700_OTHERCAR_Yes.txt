            The dealer did not have a Legacy L on hand for a test drive, so we took a short test drive on a GT. The GT is supposed to have a firmer suspension so we assumed that the Legacy L would have a softer ride. Our last two cars were Subaru's, a 97 Legacy and a 2000 Forrester, (the best cars we ever owned)so we assumed (That word again)that the 2004 Legacy would be as good or better. Our 97 Legacy with 130,000 Miles on it had a far better ride and did not have a squeak or rattle besides. 
We have had the car 3 months now and have modified our opinion somewhat. After going through several snow storms here, the secure feeling you get with this car is unbelievable, and has helped us to accept this car.
The ride is still very stiff (going over a tar strip is an adventure, The seats are hard(I sat on a pillow until I adapted to the seat), the transmission gets confused between 30-40 miles an hour and actually feels like it is lugging in the wrong gear. Flowing into traffic is like playing Russian Roulette, you have to stomp the gas pedal and pray. The gas mileage, as expected, is poor, (but has been improving)we understood that since the car is 3400 lbs, has all wheel drive and is underpowered.
The trick with this car is to accelerate gently, if you press the gas pedal firmly, the transmission hesitates than kicks down into passing gear. The resulting roar from the engine in traffic is embarrassing. Unfortunately, sometimes you don't have a choice when you are trying to keep up with traffic.  
We had the dealer check the car and were told that it was normal, ( like what would you expect from a dealer?)
But the worst is the treatment we got from Subaru, a company We always had great respect for. When we called and wrote to the Subaru main office, we were dismissed as cranks. We will keep this car because of it's safety, but we would have to think carefully about buying another car from a company as cold as this.
