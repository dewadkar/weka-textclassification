            My Honda Civic Experience
    I am a graduate student and wanted the most reliable, efficient transportation possible.  After studying up on the possibilities in my price range (up to $12,000 base price), I narrowed my choice down to the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic.  Comparing the two, I knew I preferred the style of the Civic, and after discussing the price with both dealers and test driving both cars, the choice was very simple - the Honda Civic.  There are three basic options, and I chose the middle one that came with electric everything and A/C.  The only extra option I got was the keyless entry/alarm system, which I highly recommend for two reasons: safety (faster to get into your car) and anti-theft (the Civic is very popular with car thieves).  
    The positives of my new car include: 1)The clutch and shifting operations are incredibly smooth.  I drove a friend's Saturn and there was no comparison; the Honda was much easier.  2)Fuel economy - even driving in the hills of San Francisco I am still getting an honest 30mpg, which is nice with gas costing $1.50/gal. out here.  3)Nice body style - it is modestly cute to match its engine performance and general use.  4)Performance - while certainly not a sports car, it is very fun to drive and feels quite comfortable at 90mph.  5)Resale value - looking at used cars in this area, the Hondas have way-above-average resale values, supposedly because their engines outlast the competition.
    The short list of negatives include: 1)Radio - does not have a tape player.  2)The dealers seem to make their money on a variety of &quot;extra&quot; programs like insurance deals, special wax coatings, etc.  I would guess that other dealers do the same thing, but beware.  I took a few of them and ended up, with taxes, paying $16,000.  Do NOT FALL FOR THESE EXTRAS.  Immediately after refusing a $1500 supplemental insurance program, the dealer offered to cut the price in half!!!  Don't rush, think about it, and you will walk out with a beautiful car that should serve you as well as it has served me so far.
