            I bought Kia Spectra 2000 (known as Shuma) in July,in Turkey.Yes, Turkey.
This is my fourth brand new car. I had Hyundai, Fiat and Passat before
that. I've inspected all the cars and prices in the market and I realised
Spectra is the only car which you can get most by paying less. A lot of
options are standard in Spectra.Cheap car doesn't mean unqualified car.
When you enter the car you may think you're in Honda or Mitsubishi.
It has a huge inner space,vast trunk volume,great performance and sporty
outlook.The hatch opens like Mitsubishi Carisma.
Driving is easy and comfortable but the brakes respond a little late in the first 1000 miles, then becomes better.The seats are in low position
like in Honda.The engine and the tyres sound can be heard inside because of poor insulation.The performance is great on inter-city roads.
When I drive this car in the city everybody looks at this car because
there are just two of them in my city.
I recommend this car to the ones who don't want to pay money for
the brand names,TV commercials,advertisements and test drive cars.
You know what I mean?<br><br>
