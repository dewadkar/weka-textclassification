            Fast little car at a great price.

This car has a sleek, sporty look. A newer updated image for a Celica, this car has a real bubble feel inside.

The car comes equipped with stock speakers that produce unbelievable surround sound. The tweeters are crisp and clear.

You sit low in bucket seats great for cruising. The dash is open and roomy. I can't say that for the back seat though. Don't expect to have any backseat drivers. It seats two comfortably. The hatchback is roomy.

The engine runs smooth and quiet. This car is great on gas. The brakes are quick to stop, and the car is fast to accelerate. Mine came equipped with passenger air bags, alloy wheels, cd, anti-lock brakes, and rear spoiler.

I don't know all the technical terms for cars like my husband does, but I know that this is a very dependable vehicle. Toyota lives up to its name. And it makes driving more of a fun thing than a chore.
