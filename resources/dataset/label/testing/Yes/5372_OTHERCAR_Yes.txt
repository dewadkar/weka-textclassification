            I bought a '94 Nissan Sentra 2 years ago.  It's a used car.  But, I love it.  It has automatic everything.  Windows, locks, seat belts.  Power steering.  I love that car.  I don't know what I will do when I have to get rid of it.
I haven't had any major problems with it.  Had to replace both front axles.  But, that's about it.  It gets great gas mileage.  It's big enough for a family.  Four doors makes it easy to get a baby carrier in and out.
That little car has been run to death.  I have driven from Norfolk, VA to Topeka, KS and back.  From Norfolk to Atlantic Beach, Florida.  From Atlantic Beach to Pensacola and back every weekend for 8 weeks.  From Atlantic Beach to New Orleans and back three times.  And, from Atlantic Beach to Topeka and back.  The poor thing has over 100,000 miles on it.  But, it's still running great.  I think I will have that car until it completely dies on me.  If I have to replace it, I think I would go get another one.  They are great cars.  As you can tell, they take a beating and still keep going.  This is one car I would definitely recommend to people.
The only thing I'm not too fond of is that it doesn't have air bags.  But, I'm not sure if thats a good thing or not.  I know it's probably better to have them than not.<br><br>
