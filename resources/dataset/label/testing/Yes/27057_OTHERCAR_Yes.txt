            I have had my 450 zoom for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it.  The quality of the pics is phenomenal and it is loaded with easy to use features.  I had it out of the box and was taking pictures within 5 minutes - but it is a good idea to read the manual as there are a lot of hidden features that make using the 450 all the more enjoyable.  This camera can store right around 124 images at 640x480 with the included 8 MB flash card which which is a great resolution for the web.  I usually even downsize the images on the computer to make them smaller - both in view size and in file size.  The rapid fire shooting works really well also.

All around, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.  I LOVE this camera.

On a side note, be sure to buy NiMH batteries for it - it eats batteries fairly fast with the LCD screen on<br><br>
