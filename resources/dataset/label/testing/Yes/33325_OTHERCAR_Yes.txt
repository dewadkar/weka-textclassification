            I want to start off by saying that I do not own a Park Avenue.  That's not to say that I don't want to...just that I don't.

My wife and I rent cars for long trips.  It's better than driving our old cars and cheaper than paying a new car note.  Also, you have peace-of-mind in case of a breakdown.

We recently rented a full-size car (Chevy Impala, Pontiac Grand Prix) from National Car Rental.  When we went to pick up the car, we were given a free upgrade to the Park Avenue.  Being familiar with Buicks (my grandparents owned a LeSabre and my parents have two LeSabres), I welcomed the upgrade.

I was not disappointed.  The Park Avenue rode like a dream.  It was equipped with just a few options, as this WAS a rental.  Among the options were climate control, dual power seats, CD & cassette players, steering wheel controls and keyless entry.

Since we were taking a round trip from east Tennessee to south Louisiana (GEAUX TIGERS!), these amenities were handy to have.  I used the power seat controls to frequently readjust my seat so that I wouldn't become fatigued.  The steering wheel controls allowed me to work the climate control and stereo without having to take my eyes off the road.

Most people have preconceived notions of what big American cars are.  "Gas-guzzler" usually comes to mind.  Not with the Park Avenue, though.  We regularly got about 28 mpg on the interstate and while tooling around Baton Rouge, we got about 23...not bad for a truly big car.  My wife's Honda Accord only gets about 29 on the interstate and there's just no comparison in size and ride.

GM has made continual refinements to the 3.8 (231 CID) V6 in the nearly 40 years of it's lifetime.  It's become smoother, quieter and more powerful while becoming more fuel efficient.  With more than 205 horsepower (and 240 in the supercharged version), this motor is a marvel that flies in the face of contemporary beliefs that you have to have multiple camshafts for this type of power and efficiency.

The fit and finish were excellent on the car we rented.  It had a quiet ride, albeit with some road noise.  The sound system was extremely nice.
