            I got to borrow my friend's '93 323 when my '91 Integra was in the shop.  I fell in love with it.  It was her first car which her uncle gave to her for a dollar as a present.  The car has 180,000 or miles on it without any mechanical problems, except for a new muffler, which is expected at this mileage. 
This car has a lot of character, it is the little engine that could.  It's durability adds to its character; it's a car that one could own for many years and become attached to.  Most impressive given the car's affordability, and simplicity is it's competency.  This car feels less rickety than my Integra does and has a quieter engine, which is just as smooth.  Everything is well put together, and after my friend hit a curb at 30 mph, all it needed was a new tire. 
Looking at it , it doesn't seem special, but it looks better than a Tercel or Escort from the same era.  A great plus from its boxy design is the ability for it to make great use of its space.  It has much more interior room than my Integra, while matching it in trunk size.  Being a hatchback gives it wagon-like utility when the seats are folded down.  Inside, the materials aren't as nice as those on the outside, and the spaces between plastic panels are wide and uneven.  The plastic is not of high quality, but it is durable and the dashboard has well placed controls.  There is vinyl on the otherwise comfortable and supportive seats.  Compared to a 1993 base Civic hatchback's interior, this car's is awful.  Motorized seatbelts, no cloth, and no airbag.  However, this car has matching fuel economy, is cheaper, as reliable, and has twelve more horsepower, so it's a better choice in my book.
Driving the car is much, much more fun than I expected.  The manual steering isn't as hard as one might expect.  Additionally, it's precise, gives good road feel and is quick.  The shifter is light and precise, and the clutch is easy to use, not grabby like some other cars' clutches.  The brakes are firm, but aren't noteworthy.  They stop the car when asked, but lock in an emergency.  I'd like to see ABS, but at this price, I'm not complaining.  With 82 horsepower, a five speed, and only 2,200 pounds to carry, this car feels quick and keeps up with traffic easily.  It's not going to burn out that BMW next to you, but with 37 miles to the gallon, it's fast.
Anyone looking for cheap, reliable and somewhat fun transportation should look at this car.  It can be purchased for about $2,000 now, and because there isn't anything to break on it, the Mazda 323 should last for a while.  If you absolutely MUST have power steering, look elsewhere.  I also don't think that an automatic version of this car would be as quick, but if you're looking for an auto, you likely aren't interested in speed.  While the 323 is meant for point A to point B transport, it is also a competent all around car.  I recommend its purchase.<br><br>
