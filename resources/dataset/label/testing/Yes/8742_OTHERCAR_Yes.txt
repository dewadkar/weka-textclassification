            I am PROUD OWNER OF A 1994 ACURA LEGEND L, AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE AND LOW MAINTENANCE COST INVOLVED. I BOUGHT THE ACURA FOR THE STYLISH LOOKS BUT, AFTER 4 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP I AM IMPRESSED BY SO MANY THINGS WITH THIS CAR IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I HAVE TAKEN ABOUT 4 LONG ROAD TRIPS IN MY ACURA AND, I LOVE HOW COMFORTABLE THE SEATING AND THE GLIDING EFFECT OF THE CAR ON THE ROAD MAKES IT SO COMFORTABLE FOR LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL.I WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE WHO LIKES THE BEST OF THE BEST TO JUST GO FOR IT, AND TEST DRIVE THE ACURA. I AM SURE NOTHING ELSE WILL COMPARE TO THIS TOP OF THE LINE HIGH PERFORMANCE AUTOMOBILE.  <br><br>
