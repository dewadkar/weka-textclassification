            2000 Jeep Sahara Wrangler SUV
Let me make this clear up front.  This review is not written to convince a potential buyer that this vehicle is superior in every way to any other SUV manufactured or any other automobile in the same price range.  It is not intended to say that it is better or worse then the CJ series of Jeeps.  I previously owned a CJ-5 and CJ-7 as well as a Cherokee and Grand Cherokee.  Have previously owned Ford Bronco�s, Chevy S-10�s, and Chevy full size Blazer�s, pick up and vans all of which were 4x4 and all performed adequately for their intended purposes in a particular time frame.  Having said this I will discuss the pros and cons of my brand New 2000 Wrangler Sahara.
My primary purpose for this Jeep is to commute to and from work daily, gad about town for errands, and occasionally play weekend warier on easy to moderate 4x4 trails in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  This Jeep was custom ordered with every option Jeep offers except duel tops.  I opted to have only the hard top and if the convertible is needed it can be added later.  
The auto transmission shifts smoothly through the gears.  I would prefer it to shift just a little slower between 2nd and 3rd, as it sometimes seems to fast and lugs the engine down a little.  The steering is much smoother and refined from the CJ�s but still has that quick turn on a dime response that is really needed while off road.  The flat front windshield still creates some wind noise and may be objectionable to those looking for a luxury 4x4.  The Quadra coil suspension is the best thing that ever happened to the Wrangler however due to the short wheelbase the ride could never be as good as the Grand Cherokee (for those seeking luxury).  The every day ride is excellent yet no loss in performance has been noticed when off road.  The 4.0L engine performs better then my old CJ-7 with the carburetor. There seems to be no lack of power climbing any grade I care to take in the Rocky's. Gas mileage may be just a little better but not much.  17 highway and 13 city so far, maybe with more miles towards break in it will improve.  Internally there is absolutely no rattles or squeaks and this is a major milestone compared to my CJ�s.  The ABS brakes work as well as any I have had previously.   A friend asked me what would I change if I were Chrysler engineering.  I had to think about this a while but here is my list.
1) Add a hood lock to keep thieves out of the engine compartment.
2) Put the Grand Cherokee style dome light in the rear compartment so loading groceries in the dark tailgate can be lit without opening a front door.  A no cost item to Chrysler.
3) Add power lock option with remote control access.
4) Add a wire harness option with light bar attaching mounting screw holes to the windshield frame.  Adding overhead lights would be much easier to install.
Off coarse there are many things that could be added, but then again I had the choice of stepping up to another Grand Cherokee and getting all the creature comforts.  
The paint, interior and exterior finish, trim and assembly is all-excellent.  I went over this Jeep with a fine tooth comb inside and out looking for flaws, but could find none.  The Wrangler is not for everyone.  Many still see it as a crude overpriced SUV.  For me it is the perfect all around vehicle.  I would recommend it for any out door types.  Hunters, hikers, fisherman, off road enthusiast, motor home people looking for the dingy to tow and off coarse the young girl watchers.
