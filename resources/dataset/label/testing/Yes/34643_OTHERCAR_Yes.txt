            Wow!  What can I say about My Montana!  How about I LOVE IT!  It has been the best van I have ever drove.  My husband and I decided that it was time for a new van.  We took his 94 Dodge ram and started hunting.  I test drove Suburbans, Dodge mini vans, Astro, you name it I tried it.  I finally found the one I wanted.  It was a 99 Pontiac Montana.  I didn't much care for the color, being Dark green, but it grew on me.  It seat 8 comfortably.  I have 4 kids, so this is a big plus for me.  I also coach a girls major league softball team, so that was another plus.  When I first saw it I said "This is the van I want."  We took it for a long test drive.  I fell in love.  It has a built in child seat which was a plus, although my 4 year old didn't like the idea.  It was used when I bought it, but only had 41,000 miles on it.  I was happy for that, as my other van has 145,000 on it.  The best part for me is the seats.  I can take them out myself.  I am a crafter and I need the space for my shows.  This van has so much space.  When the seats come out I have room to transport just about anything.  They go back in just as easy.  
I love the dual doors.  It took my kids some time to remember that there was two doors.  They all kept climbing out the passanger side.  I would laugh at them.  I wish I had the remote doors, but may add them later.  It has keyless entry.  I love this feature.  If you hands are full all you do it hit a button, no struggling to fit the key in the lock.  Makes it easier for a mother with more than one child.  
The power in this van is amazing!  You step on the peddal and it really moves.  I squeeled the tires the first few times I drove it.  I would say it has double the power my old Lumina had.  I am on my way faster now.  
My husband loves the van too.  He is now driving the old lumina,  he always says when he gets in mine, "I am so glad we bought this Montana,  It drives so much nicer than the lumina."  You have to understand, my husband is picky when it comes to cars.  It took us 8 months to find the truck we had.  
My over all opinion of this van is:  If you don't have a Montana, you don't have a Van!  It is the best Van Ever!
