            We set out to get the most car for our budget - we got much more than we expected!  We had almost decided on a compact.  When I told the salesman the options we wanted, he told me I could get a Malibu for about the same price.  I drove one and loved it right away!  The Malibu LS is large enough and sturdy enough to make me feel very safe on the roads.  There is plenty of room inside for my wife and me, as well as our two teenagers, 17 and 19.  The many nice options included in the LS package are a great value.  The power drivers' seat allows for very quick and easy adjustment for all four drivers in our household.  We have consistently gotten in the mid to upper 20s in miles per gallon - outstanding for this midsize car.  Outstanding comfort, ride, performance and handling.

Our main difficulty has been with our servicing dealer.  We have needed some minor repairs under warranty.  The trouble has been that the dealer didn't complete each repair in one visit.  We took the car to the shop, and after a day or two received a call to let us know that the car was ready.  After arriving at the dealership, we were told that parts had been ordered.  We than had to schedule another visit.  If we were in a remote location, this would be understandable, but in the Chicago area?  It should not happen.  I suspect that the dealer was releasing the car so that we would not have to receive free replacement transportation specified in the warranty while waiting for the part to be delivered.<br><br>
