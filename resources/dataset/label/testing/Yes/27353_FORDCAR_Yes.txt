            In May 1994, I made a $ 24,000 investment in a 1993 Ford Thunderbird SuperCoupe.  I LOVE the car, but had I known then what I know now, I may have changed my mind.

Being a little over 6 years old, I have added up almost 97,000 miles on my SC.  I have had the recall involvements, periodic motorized seatbelt problems, and other little glitches.

The car still had the ORIGINAL front brakes, and is just about due for the 100,000 tune up.  This is a FAST comfortable ride.  There is a small problem....

Last week, the car started overheating.  I just replaced the radiator 3 months ago, and in checking, saw no leaks.  The belts still worked, so I took it to the garage that works on my vehicles.  After checking the car (which was now low on antifreeze), I was told it had a blown head gasket.  Without being told, I knew this was going to be $$$$.  But what choice do I have.

The shop owner is a good friend of mine, and he told me that Ford is having a problem with the 3.8litre head gaskets, and thought that they had extended the warranty on them.  So, I rushed home and started checking....look for yourself....Search for FORD HEAD GASKET.  You will be shocked as to the number of complaints.  Now it is true, Ford did extend the vehicle warranty for the head gasket to 7 yrs./100,000 miles.  SO I called Ford.  Even though my car is within the 7/100,000 boundries, I was told too bad, it is a 1993.  They are only covering 1994 and 1995 at this time.  EVEN THOUGH, the Ford rep conceded:
      1. The 1993 engines are the same as the 1994 and 1995
      2. They have received numerous complaints of the head gaskets for 1993
      3. They are tracking the problem
      4. There is a court case somewhere involving a class action on the 1993

So, if you decide to buy, make sure the head gasket has already been addressed.  My problems most likely started at 65,000 miles, but there are cases as low as 35,000 miles.

What gets me the most is that Ford LACKS THE BACKING when they know there is a problem.<br><br>
