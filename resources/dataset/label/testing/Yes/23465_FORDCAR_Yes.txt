            I have owned a 96' Taurus for almost five years.  In that time I have not had one problem.  It is an incredible car with plenty of leg and head room with an exceptionally large trunk.  The Taurus can easily accommodate drivers of different heights from my sister-in-law(5'4&quot;) to my brother (6'3&quot;).  It is a smooth running economic car.  I get about 21 miles per gallon in the city and about 25 miles per gallon on the highway.  The Taurus is also an attractive car.  I have had many requests from my parents to my college friends to give them a call when I am ready to sell my car because they know it is a good car and they want a chance to buy it.  The only downside I can think of is that the parts to the Taurus are a little different from conventional parts, so if you are in an accident, it would take a little while to get the parts you need and will probably cost a little more to replace.<br><br>
