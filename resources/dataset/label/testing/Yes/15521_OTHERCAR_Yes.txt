            The Chrysler Sebring Convertible is a beautiful car that is very quick indeed.  The roof is easily opened by a small switch in between the seats and is very warm in the wintertime.  It also has an autostick, which means you can drive it like an automatic or in manual by shifting the gears with a left and right motion of the stick shift, no clutch.  The car is really powerful and the seats are fairly comfortable.
 The only problems I have with the car is the lack of clear visibilty when the roof isn't open.  The windshield is so slanted that it is rather hard to see everything around you properly and the rearview mirror seems to get in the way. I also have already had to take the brakes in once for repairs, they were really messed up. The stereo isn't too great either, but isn't bad.
 If your looking for a rather affordable convertible, this is a good buy. Take a look at your local Chrysler dealer for more info and to take a test drive.<br><br>
