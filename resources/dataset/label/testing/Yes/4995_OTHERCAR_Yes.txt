            I just ended up with this car one day.  Yes, I know how that sounds - but that's just how it happened.  My husband and I, both proud Jetta owners, suddenly faced a dilemma one Sunday morning when my husband's 1996 Jetta wouldn't start.  "I'll just go look for another used car," he said to me, and I was stunned.  He acted like he had just said he was going to pick up milk -- and I <i> knew </i> something was wrong.  Long story short, it turns out my husband's car had <i> not </i> been performing well and had  been slowly dieing.  Rather than get it fixed, he decided to trade it in.  

I got a phone call the next day from my husband who asked me how I like Nissan.  Having parents who owned Nissan's growing up, I was familiar with their dependability, at least in our family.  That evening I was going with my husband to pick up a brand new, 2001 Nissan Sentra, hunter green (they call it "jaded"), that had only 32 miles on it.  Somehow through the course of the trade in, my husband decided to buy our <i> first ever</i> new car.  And, through conversations I am certain you don't need me to repeat, I ended up with the new car.

<b> I Now Own A Brand New 2001 Sentra!</b>

I was pretty excited, just to be having a brand new car.  I spent the first week trying to learn all of the features, of course not wanting to pay attention to the salesman or read up on any of the material.  A woman learns by doing - and this is what I did.

It is therefore natural that I would compare some things that I have found with this Sentra with my beloved previous car, a white 1997 Jetta.  <i> It is therefore also natural that I talk about the features I <b> use</b> and know about, in the order that I learned them.</i>

<b> Cars Need Gas</b>

I do not pretend to understand all of the specifications listed with this car.  I do know that it holds a 13 gallon gas tank, and gets about 33 miles a gallon - which lasts me the whole work week (I drive 60 miles round trip each day to work).  The gas tank is quirky in that I notice it tends to stay toward the Full Line for a long time, and then slowly goes down.  Once between the quarter and Empty mark, it seems to lose gas quickly, and I am often surprised when the gas light comes on.

Filling with gas has not been a breeze.  The tank has a release on the driver's side left floor - pull up to pop open.  The tank has a knob to crank and turn and I still have to learn to perform this in a fluid motion.  A few times I have actually had to have a passing by "pumper" come help me open the tank.  

<b> Car Has a Clock and a Radio</b>

 The clock is in a bad location.  I loved the Jetta clock - right on the dash under the speedometer.  The Sentra clock is on the radio - and shares space with the alert to what station I am currently on.  As I constantly flip stations, I am also constantly averting my eyes to the center panel to see the time.  Its about a 10 second wait to see the station flash and time return.  Too inconvenient for me.  

The antenna seems oddly placed - it sticks up from the hood.  My Jetta had the antenna securely mounted up the side of the front window.  I find myself at times watching the Sentra's antenna to see if it's going to hold up.  The radio plays well, and I have better speakers than in my Jetta.  It has a single tape deck with basic features.  The buttons make a small clicking sound when pressed.  The Seek and Scan however are the same button, and I often find myself having to hold the button down for quite a while to get the radio to scan on its own.  Thankfully, I usually just listen to 4 programmed stations anyway (it holds 6 programmed stations).  

<b>A Trunk To Toss In All My Purchases </b>

The trunk is large, though not as large as my Jetta - which has an amazing trunk.  I do not like that there is no light <i>inside</i> the trunk - making it hard to see where I am tossing groceries into once dark falls.   

<b> Seats Are Always Nice </b>

The seats are more bucketed, and a lot more comfortable than my Jetta.  I seem to sit higher and have a much better all around visibility.  I always had to look over my head rests in the Jetta and always had an obstructed view, which really concerned me.  I feel like the Sentra allows me to see the road from more angles easily, a big plus.  A light stays on until I fasten my seat belt - another plus.  

<b> But What About When It Rains?</b>

The wipers only have 2 settings.  Fast-ish, and really fast.  And no way to just click the thing once to get the wipers to swish just one time.  Its really annoying.  The Jetta had 3 settings, and an option to just swish once that I really miss. 

<b> A Place To Finally Put My Morning OJ!</b>

The cup holder is amazingly nice!  The Jetta is known for crappy front cup holders - Sentra blows them away.  Plenty of room for 2 cups, and the cup holder insert even removes to fit in larger or odd shaped cups!  Gotta love it! 

<b> Lights</b>

The interior and exterior lights seem powerful enough - though missing my fog lights from my Jetta some.  When I leave my lights on the car softly beeps at me, reminding me to turn them off.  I prefer the Jetta's blaring "Kuukaracha" tune that you simply cannot mistake for anything else.  

<b> Locks</b> 

My car does not have an alarm as my Jetta did - and this actually has been easier for me.  I was always setting the thing off, and always had to take care on locking my doors just so in the Jetta.  The Sentra has manual locks, and each door has to be taken on its own.  This makes it easier and quicker for me to get in and out of the car.  

<b> Overall </b>

I feel like a got a better car - it handles the corners and curves more smoothly, and is just all around "newer".  I have a great visibility and feel very safe when driving my Sentra.  There are some features that I miss, but on the whole I feel like I have upgraded to a better car for me.
