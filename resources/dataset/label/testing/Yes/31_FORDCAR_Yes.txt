            While on a vacation day, my husband, two kids and I decided to stop by a Ford Dealership and &quot;browse&quot;.  We hadn't really intended to buy a vehicle, but the salesperson let us test drive a 1999 White Ford Taurus and we were hooked! 

 I have heard that the Ford Taurus is the working class luxury car.  I believe that statement to be very accurate.  I feel like a queen while driving my Taurus.  The seats are so very comfortable, that I didn't even get stiff legs or a sore back when taking an all day trip recently. 

 Most luxury's are standard on the Taurus that you would have to pay extra for on a cheaper passenger vehicle.  We have 2 boys and this car is just right for us.  The trunk is very spacious; big enough to hold enough gear for all of us for a weekend camping. 

 We went from a Mini Van to the Taurus, and we haven't found that we miss any of the extra room that we had with the Van, because the Taurus more than makes up for it in comfort and luxury.<br><br>
