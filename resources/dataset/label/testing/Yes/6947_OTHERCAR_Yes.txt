            We traded a 93 F-150 super cab pickup for a 99 Chevy Blazer 4-door 4wd in May of 2002; in doing so, we traded 11 MPG highway for 22 MPG. We drove a number of high-rated used SUVs and the Blazer had the best combination of characteristics for our needs. The Blazer we found was a beautiful lease return with 32K miles and some factory warranty remaining. It was metallic red, and we had the dealer add a factory-standard lower body silver 2-tone paint as part of the deal (cost was $700).

Power: the Vortec V-6 is amazing for its displacement. We also drove the Explorer, Pathfinder, Grand Cherokee and Trooper. The Blazer had the most "git" from stoplights and also had perceptibly more power at the 80 MPH freeway speeds common along I-25 near Denver. This was a big factor in our decision.  The 3+OD automatic behaves well, shifts intelligently (much better than those in Fords I've driven) and will keep the revs climbing till nearly redline under hard acceleraction. Note: a transmission expert friend of mine says these trannies last nearly forever if they're flushed and new fluid put in every 30-40K miles. Highway mileage has been in the 20-22 MPG range even at the 80 MPH speeds common on I-25. In-town mileage has been more like 16. I have no complaints with either observed figure.

Interior: A Chevy is GM's price leader, and the materials reflect this.  Our daughters emphatically did NOT want leather seats, and the velour material is very nice.  There's plenty of plastic inside, but it's understated and belongs where it's used.  Front seats are decent, but they are MUCH better with power assist.  The lumbar supports are somewhat aggressive - you may like this or not, so check it out. Front leg room is OK, but the front passengers have space equivalent to a large passenger car, no more.  Rear seats are comfortable and sit slightly higher than the fronts, although the high front seat backs still make it hard to see forward very well. Conversation is a bit difficult, as the high seat backs tend to muffle sound exchanges from front to back.

Cargo: It's there, but you won't be hauling plywood.  The rear compartment is *just* wide enough for a bag of golf clubs. With the rear seat up, there is more height than in a car; that's the main distinction between the cargo space in the Blazer and our Audi 200, which has a huge trunk that's as deep as the Blazer's cargo area.  However, the rear seats are a snap to fold, and the headrests automatically flip out of the way, unlike competitors like the Grand Cherokee.  The load floor is flat and decently long with the rear seat folded.  Also, the rear seat can be split 60/40 and only one portion folded at a time.  Nice, and it has been useful as well. I also know why so many of these have Thule or Yakima cargo boxes on top - there is limited cargo room. For a long trip, an aerodynamic cargo box on top adds considerable useful storage space (don't put heavy stuff in it as that will change your center of gravity) and only lowers gas mileage 1.5 to 2 MPG. That's handy!

Driving: great acceleration, nimble handling, but a little more body roll than I like.  This Blazer may get Bilsteins or Koni shocks in a few thousand miles in an effort to moderate body roll.  I may also check out different anti-sway bars. Steering is tight and responsive for a truck (not for a nimble smaller car). Controls and switches are intuitive and easy to learn. Braking performance is very good, which is one reason we bought a 99 - there were significant braking upgrades to the Blazer beginning in 98. The auto 4WD mode is very safe and easy to engage when streets are slippery from rain or snow. 

We are extremely happy with the Blazer and find that it has become the favorite family car.  The girls like the AM/FM/CD/Cassette system a lot, and the sound is good. (Switching to aftermarket speakers will probably fill in the mid-range and highs, which are the weakest frequency ranges.) We plan to keep it for 100K+ more miles.
