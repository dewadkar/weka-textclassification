            <b>Purchasing background</b>

I purchased my 2.7T in June of 2000.  It has xenon lights, the sports package, and the 6 speed manual transmission.
I was shopping for an S4 when I decided to purchase my car.  I had found a few S4s in the area, but there were still not many to choose from.  I found the purchasing process to be prohibitively difficult when searching for an S4 as well.  I spoke to a number of sales people.  All were completely inflexible, not willing to discuss price at all, and not will to work with me to find a car in the exact trim level I desired.
It was during such an S4 quest that I found my A6 2.7T.  I was in the back parking lot of a local dealership waiting for a salesman to bring the keys to an S4 I was interested in when I spotted the 6 speed manual transmission shifter in a &quot;large&quot; black sedan.  I did not know that a manual transmission (one of my prerequisites) was available in any A6, and I was interested.  I inquired, and learned that the 2.7T has the same drivetrain as the S4, and weighs very little more.  I have heard different stories regarding the exact weight difference ranging from 200 to 700 pounds.

<b>Comparison to S4</b>

I test drove my 2.7T and found the performance almost identical to the much more cramped S4.  The comfort level, however, was incomparable.  The S4 is cramped and small, especially in the back seat.  Shoulder room is somewhat limited in the front.  It is definitely more roomy than a true sports car such as the TT, but it is still limited.  The A6, on the other hand, is extremely comfortable.  My car has the sports package, which I would <b>highly</b> recommend.  It includes the same seats as the S4, which I love.  I've driven an A6 with standard seats, and they are hard and unfitted.  The sports seats have excellent lumbar support.
I made my final decision by test driving an S4 and A6 back to back with my wife.  The decision was easy.  They felt almost identical with regard to performance, and the A6 was significantly more comfortable.

<b>Price</b>

My decision was finalized by the pleasure of dealing with Audi on the A6, as opposed the experience with the S4.  The S4 with my options retailed at $41,500.  I would have too pay this price in total, which was a simple violation of principles.  My A6 retailed at over $45k.  I was able to bargain it down to $42,500.  Paying only $1000 more for a much more comfortable car seemed like a bargain to me when comparing the the S4.

<b>Ownership Experience</b>

My Audi is a joy to drive, and has been reliable with one major exception.  With about 1500 miles, my transmission encountered serious problems.  I was shifting from first to second, and the shift was extremely difficult.  I had to force the gear into place (bad synchronizer?) and it felt as if I were physically bending the linkage when I shifted.  This problem was replicated getting into first.  3rd and above were normal.  I was close to the dealership and able to being it directly in.  Audi looked at it and started to disassemble it.  Audi policy is apparently to replace the whole transmission if the problem can not be resolved without opening the case, and they followed this procedure.  The whole process was very expedient, and completely warranted.  Audi could not explain the problem, but suggested that it may have been due to aggressive shifting before the transmission &quot;broke in.&quot;  The fact that I added a performance enhancing computer chip so early in the car's life (300 miles) may have been a contributing factor.  Needless to say, I did not mention this to Audi.  I left the chip in while the car was in for service, and this caused no issues.  They replaced the transmission (and showed me the $12,000 parts cost I avoided via warranty) and I was on my way.  I have not had a problem since.

<b>Audi Service Phenomenal</b>

Audi service has been a pleasure to work with at Audi of North Atlanta in Roswell, GA.  I just brought my car in for the first 8k mile maintenance.  Audi provided me with a rental car (no loaner available on short notice), performed all of the required maintenance, and checked my throttle body boot at my recommendation (I was weary after reading about a technical bulletin on the Internet).  In addition, Audi is going to replace the side molding on my car, which has bent out, free of charge.  Whether this aesthetic problem should be covered under warranty could definitely be debated, but Audi posed no questions.

<b>Modifications</b>

I purchased a Garrett Chip for my car at 300 miles from Eurotech Atlanta in Marietta GA (www.eurotech-atlanta.com).  Bryan at Eurotech was extremely competent and friendly.  He let me watch him as he did all the work , including the soldering of the chip under a magnifying glass.  He did an excellent job and was clearly very concerned with quality.  The whole deal cost me $600 installed, which I was happy to pay.
The chip has increased my power very noticibly. I think this modification is a no-brainer.  Horsepower is now estimated at over 300.  I haven't timed 0-60 yet, but I would estimate it is under 5.5, and quicker than a stock S4.  Second and third gear and extremely powerful, and the car is a joy to drive in all circumstances.  I have had it to 145 miles per hour, and it felt capable of close to 160 (too many laws and not enough road in this country). 
I have since purchased a UUC short shifter kit for this car, but have not yet installed it.  I feel that the shift throws are too long and soft as-is, and I am looking forward to the new feel, which I will report.

<b>Overall Opinion</b>

With the chip modification, this car satisfies almost any vehicular desire.  Quattro provides awesome traction in inclement weather OR for rapid launches on dry pavement (yes, the chipped 2.7T CAN still squeal all 4 tires from a standstill).  I have carried 5 adults very comfortable in this car, and the high torque at low RPM minimizes the impact of the added weight.  I feel very safe in this car, as performance is very predictable.  My only preference would be to have stiffer tires via 17&quot; wheels, which I believe are now part of the 2001 sport package.<br><br>
