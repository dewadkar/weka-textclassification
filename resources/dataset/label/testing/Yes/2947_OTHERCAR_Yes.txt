            I rented this car in the summer of 2000 to go propose to my now-wife.  I had the car for four days.

<b>The Good</b>
Fast, sporty, fun to drive.  Well laid out instrument panel and dashboard.  Great fuel economy.  Great handling and engine performance.  Stomp on the gas and you are gone!  Even with an automatic transmission, you can almost redline the engine.

<b>The Bad</b>
You can't lock the drivers door from the inside while the door is open.  This forces you to use the key to lock up the car, which prevents you from locking the keys in the car.  I didn't like this feature and found it annoying!  The back seat is pretty much useless and is really only there to keep the insurance rates down as a four-seater.  The interior is a bit cramped overall, but this is a small car after all.

<b>The Ugly</b>
The 4-speed automatic transmission is a very poor choice for this car.  At highway speeds in top gear, the engine is doing 3500-4000 RPM.  Can't be too good for the engine, and the noise is very tiring after a while on long road trips.  I would recommend the 5-speed stick which would undoubtedly perform a lot better.  If they made an Integra with a better automatic transmission, I would buy this car in a heartbeat.
