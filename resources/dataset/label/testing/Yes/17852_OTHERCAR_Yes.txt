            The Chevy has come along way in the past ten years, from the 1990 model that had a boxy look and a defective paint job.  Today's Blazer is sleek and stylish.  The interior is comfortable with plenty of room both in the front and the back as well as cargo room.  Since this model is small than some of the other midsize SUVs it has easy handling as well as ample acceleration.  It's 4WD option makes it an ideal tool in winter driving.  The price ranges from quite affordable to a bit expensive. The blazer is comparable to the GMC Jimmy and the Ford Explorer. Although I'd pick the Blazer over the Jimmy any day it's a close call between the Blazer and the Explorer. If you want basically the same car and save a bit more, you might tend toward the Explorer.  Either way, the Blazer is a truly remarkable vehicle for the price. <br><br>
