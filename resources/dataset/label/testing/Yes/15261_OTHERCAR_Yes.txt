            	The Sony Digital Mavica Camera was a great purchase in our household. The convenience alone was worth it. We already had a scanner but rarely used it so we decided to shop for a digital camera and came across this one. At the time it was a �top of the line� camera and we agree with that to this day..

The Sony Digital Mavica�s features are:

~ 3.5 Floppy
~ LCD screen
~ 3 different Flash levels
~ 5 different picture effect options
~ 2 Picture sizes (640 x 480 or 1024 x 768)
~ 2 different picture quality to choose from
~ Auto/Manual focusing
~ 4 different recording modes (Normal, Email, Voice and Bitmap)
�And that�s just some of the options. 

	The options are what drew us to purchase this camera. I love the fact that I can take a picture and instantly view it and if I don�t like it I can delete it. There is also a feature that you can make 60 second videos with sound. I use this option a lot to get my youngest daughters �first�s� on disks since we don�t have a video recorder. The picture effects options are great too. You can take pictures in Black and White, Solarized, Neg. Art and Sepia. I use the black and white and they come out great (a lot cheaper than reg. Film and development). All the options are great!
	As far as not liking anything about the camera I would have to say it�s a bit heavy and I seem to get red eye a lot, though that could just be my fault.
	By far this was one of the best purchases that we have made and have been thrilled since the day we brought it home. 
Happy Shopping!
