            When I decided to spend the big dough (for me) on a digital camera, I did some research. It was between Nikon 3100 and the Canon A70. I actually decided on the A70 but when I went to buy it, it was out of stock for some type of repairs in three stores. I couldn't wait. I bought the Nikon 3100.
I am really happy with it. I bought it in August and I've taken over 2,000 pictures now (12/10/03). The quality is excellent. Of course with most digital cameras, poor/ low lighting appears grainy. The setup is very easy to use. I never looked at the instruction until later. It only takes two AA batteries (the canon a70 takes 4) and again with all digitals you need rechargeable batteries. 
I go to Wal-mart and get all my photos printed like regular film. I love it. 
The lcd display is durable. I always worry that I've scratched it but it has a tough exterior; no scratches. I like the silver look and small size because I take it with me everywhere. 
The only problems I have with it are lack of manual options and slow start up/slow taking picture after the last picture (about 1.5seconds) while it saves the picture. When you turn it on it takes about 5 seconds for the camera to be functional which means you could miss your shot.
It's got some nice auto features that can help you adjust for bad lighting. 
I would recommend this camera to those who don't need/want manual options (most people don't unless you wanna get really artsy).  The quality is excellent. Also, the software that comes with cameras are usually crappy anyway, I use Microsoft Picture it for editing.
I'm willing to show my own pictures. email: jessi330@yahoo.com
