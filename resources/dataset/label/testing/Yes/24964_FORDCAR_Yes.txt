            I purchased my 1999 Ford Mustang V6 in August of 1999. I got a  white V6 with leather interior, Mach 460 (sound system upgrade)-well worth it, automatic, rear spoiler, interval wipers, front floor mats, cruise control, anti-lock brakes with traction control. I think the most valuable options on the car are the anti-lock brakes with traction control.  With rear wheel drive, it's difficult to drive in inclement weather without these features. The traction control device can be switched off for burnouts which adds to the fun factor of this pony car. The V6 is an overhead valve 3.8 liter engine rated at 190 horsepower. The horsepower and torque were upgraded for the 1999 model year on the V6.  The horsepower increased from 150 to 190 and the torque from 215 in 1998 to 220 in 1999.  Also for the 1999 model year, the curb weight was cut from 3,175 to 3,115 lbs.
The 0-to-60 time pulled in at 7 seconds for the V6, and quarter-mile time of 15 seconds @ 85 m.p.h. Not bad for a V6. This car is a lot of fun! Only thing I wish for is a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16" wide tires/rims, fog lights, and dual exhausts. The trunk is large, but low in depth, and it's not made to haul baggage.  But, hey, it's a sports car. Gas mileage is not too shabby, if you drive responsibly (not flooring the accelerator from the stop lights). I am able to get 18 mpg(city) and 27 mpg (highway) with an automatic. I have had virtually no problems with this car.  Performance mods are easier to find for the V6. There are even mustang web sites and mustang car clubs.  It really is a modern finely tuned American legendary muscle car.
