                  I am writing about the Ford Explorer. I have recently purchased the second such vehicle, trading in the first one on the new car. I now wish I had kept the original one as well. I love the way it handles in the snow and especially on very steep hills of Pennsylvania.  It is a very comfortable car to ride in and the cargo space in the rear is wonderful as well as the extra space if the back seats are folded down.   
       The only problem I see with this vehicle is the low gas mileage, so if someone is really concerned about the cost of gasoline it may not be the vehicle to choose. Another concern is that older people have a difficult time getting in and out of the vehicle, even though we have running boards installed on ours.   We do carry a plastic footstool to aid in getting up high in the vehicle.
