            It's as quiet as a tomb - great ride, the Nakamichi stereo will make your ears ring if you like. Economy is good - I get 23 MPG combined. It has plenty of speed when you need it. The local service organization is excellent and I've heard others are the same. If you have a complaint or hear any "phantom" noises, be prepared to have 2-3 guys get in the car with you for a test drive. In one such case, my dealer couldn't duplicate the problem but gave me an RX300 to drive while they researched the issue for a few days... Interior is quite luxurious. Great paint, etc. Just a great car.

I took it in for 30K mile service and it cost $566. The list of what they did read like "Inspect this, review that, examine this..." It sounded to me like the most expensive fluids change I'd ever seen. Cost of previous service stops were unremarkable.

I've heard a number of comparisons of the ES to the Camry. In my limited experience, these comparisons are invariably made by people who own either Camrys or comparative junks, for some reason. I don't mean to demean the Toyota Camry, but this isn't really an issue. The ES shares the frame, which is common - and common sense - in automotive manufacturing; most cars share or are based on frames of something else. Other than that, we have, I believe, 24% common parts between the two. There certainly are many common parts on the dash & interior. If you want a Camry, buy one, but to suggest that the cars are almost identical is wrong.
