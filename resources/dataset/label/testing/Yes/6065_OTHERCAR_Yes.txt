            Camera controls are easy to figure out/use.  Takes average/good quality pictures.  I gave up trying to install software/update to use 232 serial cable and switched to USB cable (which is also supplied) with camera.  Which in the end was a better way to go, since it did not use up battery life (two AA battery).  

Since, I don't have a laptop to download the 16/32 pictures.  In that respect it is somewhat limited (for long trips, unless you have a laptop).  Would be neat if there was some type of docking station built for these type of camera.

Build durable enough but it doesn't appear it would weather well if you dropped it.  Side port where you hook up the power cord, interface cable or TV RCA jack -- is made of rubber which is &quot;cheesy&quot;.  And the attachable wrist cord attachment - is &quot;just-that&quot;.  NO case is provided for this unit.
 
Overall, I'm satisfied with what the camera can do, and what I intend for its use, which is to take it along for &quot;short&quot; trips<br><br>
