                 <b>T</b>he S-Type was a badge used on Jaguar's mid-range luxury sedans in the mid 1960s, but there is no doubt that with the 2000 S-Type Jaguar wants to capture more of the the extreme ambiance of the famous MK2 vs the 1960s S models.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

         <b>J</b>aguar's idea to make a drivers car succeeded. Both its engines; the 240 hp 3.0 V6 and the 281 HP powered 4.0 DOHC V8 are very powerful and torquey, thanks to their variable cam phasing. Close gearing allows for some excellent <b>acceleration</b> with the new ZF 5-speed automatic via J-gate. The 3.0 liter comes with the older 5-speed automatic. The 4.0 moves this beauty in luxurious fashion towards the horizon from a dead stop without any fuss whatsoever. The sound from the exhaust is refined yet robust, engine and exhaust noise are kept to a minimum however under normal acceleration. Then there is the <b>handling</b>, which combines excellent grip with excellent driver feedback. Despite the relatively  sporty set-up, the ride quality is somewhat soft as the suspension has the ability to absorb bumps almost as well as the XJ series. In all respects; this Jaguar is one fine example of a luxury sports car at a good price.

      <b>A little about these 2 amazing engines:</b> Two engines are offered in the S-type. At the lower end it's an all-new 3.0 liter V6, which is made in the U.S.A. It has an alloy block and heads, plus variable cam phasing for improved torque and an impressive power output of 240 HP all from a naturally asperated 3.0 engine. The 4.0 liter comes from the XJ8 and the XK8. A refined engine, it is an evolution of Jaguars very first V8 powerplant. It's all aluminum with twin overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder. The nippondesnso (spelling?) management system makes it very efficient.

      Jaguar engineers had to base the 2000 S-Type on the Lincoln LS's platform. That means it's substantially larger than rivals such as the BMW 5 series.(the wheel base is actually longer than the Jaguar XJ8). It also has the same Lincolns unequal length aluminum wishbone and coil spring <b>suspension</b>, but with different spring and shock rates and anti roll bar sizes. The steering has both variable -ratio and speed-proportional power assistance, while ABS is standard, and assures very quick stops, even at high speeds.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

    The <b>interior</b> of the 2000 Jaguar S-Type may not be as luxurious as a XK8, or XJ8, but its interior has Jaguar class everywhere you look. A beautiful combination of wood and leather make for one of the most classy cars on the road. All-in-all, the plush interior has the quality and presence traditionally associated with all Jaguars, and despite much criticism that this car is not a true 'JAG', this car sure fooled me.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

    The <b>exterior</b> is definitely class leading, from beautiful lines, to its sleek Jaguar traditional hood and grille. This Jag is a head turner from any angle. The Jaguar S-type will make almost all other cars on the road pale in its presence, of course this is up for speculation. This car is an automobile others will appreciate as they get passed or pass by the S-Type on the freeway. Thoughts of "I wish I had that car" will be going through the minds of almost anyone who has the chance to be so close to this cat while it's in action.


<i>Pricing:</i>

    <b>Price:</b> While the 3.0 Liter V6 represents excellent value for the money,(around $40,000) the star of the line-up is the range topping 4.0 liter V8, (around $48,000) it proves that a Jaguar, even in somewhat compact size can be a fabulous machine.

 The S-Type is a luxury car I currently could only dream of owning at this time in my life, so I can not comment of how reliable it is personally, however this car feels as 'Chevy would say' "solid as a rock."
