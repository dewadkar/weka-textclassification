            I'm a 23 year old pharmacy tech that used to drive a more sensible and luxurious Toyota Avalon XLS. My former car was fully loaded and originally had a sticker price of $32,000. Got me from one place to another in comfort..... only drawback..... IT WASN'T WHO I WAS..... I felt like I was driving mommy's car. 

One day while getting an oil change at the Toyota dealership here in Fresno, CA... I decided to take a stroll around the lot. First thing that caught my eye was the Scion xA.... it looked like a mix between a mini cooper and a matrix except BETTER. I fell instantly in love with the car. Went to get my girlfriend and told her about the new love of my life (HAHA j/k Allison) and showed it to her and she too fell in love. I had been thinking about getting another car, but after seeing the xA I knew I had to get one. 

I sold my Avalon a week later, pooled up all my funds for a down payment, went down to the dealership, told them EXACTLY what I wanted. They delivered 4 days later with a shiny new Phantom Gray Pearl xA fresh from Japan. No haggling about pricing because it's pure priced, meaning everyone pays the same price (which is already VERY reasonable). 

Well its been a week since I brought it home and I must say it's been an awesome experience. I love my car dearly and I really have a great time driving it. I end up making whatever excuse I can to take it out for a spin. The stock sound system is awesome, the seating position is high, standard power options galore, and just a great value overall. 

The car itself handles like it is riding on rails. Corners can be taken sharply at high speeds and the car will not flinch, getting lower profile tires would most likely improve this even further. Steering is firm, and responsive, and gives good feedback.

I've test driven alot of cars and this car by far has the best stock handling out of any similarly priced car, and even cars that cost 20k+. The freeway ride as quiet, and typical for a car of this size, its mildly bumpy, but not harsh, as the sport tuned suspension offers a firm ride, but is cushy enough to keep you comfortable. At freeway speeds it bumpy, and being a fairly light car you do feel the effects of the wind.

Braking is excellent with 2 front discs and 2 drums, I have only had one incident where I have had the ABS kick in and it saved me from getting into any fender benders. 4 wheel ABS is standard in all models as well. 

Acceleration feels alot faster then you would think a 108hp engine could provide. It's not a racer by any means, but the quiet little engine can pull its own weight around. In comparison to my test drive of the Matrix/Corolla platform, the Scion seems to accelerate faster initially due to its gear ratios, though the Matrix/Corolla does better on freeway acceleration. Shifting is butter smooth (given you aren't flooring it) and makes for a quiet ride. 

The interior is mostly composed of vinyl and plastics. It definitely is a step above your typical compact car in its design, and it doesn't LOOK cheap as one would expect. The front seats are sport seats and are very comfortable as they offer good lumbar support as well as hugging your sides (for all that hard cornering you'll be doing). 

The rear seats offer a suprising amount of room as well at the cost of cargo room. Cargo room is limited, unless you fold down the rear seats, so don't expect to be driving a family of 4 to the airport with too much luggage.

The stock stereo system is a 6 speaker Pioneer system with Mp3 capability as well as satellite radio ready. It sounds great, and is really impressive as far as stock systems go. 

The thing I like most is when people stare at it and ask me what it is. I've had 4 people in the past week asking me about my car and how cool they thought it looked. Nobody has any idea it's a toyota until you tell them. 

I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it, though the more xA's that are sold the fewer people will ask me about it..... so on second thought..... DON'T BUY ONE!! ;-)
