            The Kodak DX4900 Zoom is basically a point and shoot 4-Megapixel Camera. It is the same as the Kodak DX3900 (3-Megapixel) camera upgraded to a 4-Megapixel camera with a video out feature for viewing the photos on your TV. 

The 4-Megapixels produce an image the size of 2448 x 1632 pixels, this is a very large photo on your screen. You should be able to print a photo as large as 20 inches by 30 inches if you have a printer that will print that large.

Prices vary from $499 to about $359 for the Kodak DX4900, even at this low budget price it produces pretty good photos.

The camera comes with a 16MB CompactFlash memory card for the CompactFlash Type I expansion slot.

<b>The Lens </b>
The Kodak DX4900 Zoom gives you a 2x optical zoom lens equivalent to a 35mm camera of 35mm-70mm plus a 3x digital zoom to give you a total zoom of 6x.

In the normal mode the focus range is 20 inches to infinity. In the close up mode (Macro-Wide) it has a range from 2.8 inches to 28 inches. In the Macro-Telephoto it has a range from 10 inches to 28 inches. 

<b>The View!</b>
There are two ways to take your photos with a viewfinder and a color LCD.

First there is the <b>Optical Viewfinder</b> that most everyone is use to from 35mm cameras. It has framing marks and auto-focus target for easy control of the photo area. It is bright and easy to see through and covers the whole area you are trying to capture.

Then you have a <b>1.5-inch color LCD</b> for taking your photo shots, plus it is also used for reviewing your photos taken and the menu operations of the camera.

Then on top of the camera is a small <b>Monochrome Data LCD</b> that lets you view camera settings at a glance.

<b>The Connections</b>
The DX4900 Zoom is made for easy use with the <b><i>Optional</i></b> Easy Share Dock.

The camera has a USB port for downloading your photos to your computer.

There is a video out feature for viewing your photos on your TV with a user-selectable NTSC or PAL format.

<b> Easy Share Dock </b>
The Easy Share Dock sells locally for about $79.

This makes charging you batteries automatically when the camera is sitting in the Easy Share Dock and easy uploading of your photos to your computer by one touch of a button.

The disadvantages of the Easy Share Dock is when taking a trip you need to take it along and you will not have another set up rechargeable batteries unless you get a set with a charger. So for me since I always like to have a set of extra batteries along, it is cheaper to buy a charger and a set of batteries for about $29 verses the Easy Share Dock for $79.

<b> The Flash </b>
The Kodak DX4900 has a built-in flash with Automatic, Fill, Red-Eye and Off.

The flash range is 1.6 ft. to 10.5 ft. in the wide-angle and 1.6 ft. to 7.5 ft. in the telephoto.

<b>Other Specifications </b>
Exposure Control is TTL-AE (multi-pattern, center weighted, center spot)
Shutter Speed of 16 seconds to 1/2000 of a second
ISO Equivalent of Auto, 100, 200 and 400
White Balance - Automatic, Daylight, Tungsten and Fluorescent
Color Mode - Black & White, Sepia and Color
Sharpness &#150 Sharp, Standard and Soft
File Format - JPEG/EXIF V2.1

<b>Requirements </b>
Here are the requirements for using the camera with your computer.

For the <b>PC!</b>
Windows 98, 2000, Millennium Edition or XP
A 200 MHz processor or greater
About 70MB free on your hard drive
CD-ROM for software installation
A USB Port
Color Monitor with 16-bit color card

For the <b>Macintosh!</b>
POWERMAC System with OS 8.6 or better
64MB RAM
100MB hard drive disk space
CD-ROM for software installation
A USB Port
Color Monitor with 16-bit color card

<b>Likes!</b>
The main like of this camera is it easy to use and produces pretty good photos.

For a 4-Megapixel Camera is has one of the best prices I have seen.

<b>Dislikes!</b>
My main dislikes of the Kodak DX4900 Zoom is it looks cheap, like a $100 camera. 

The 1.5-inch color LCD could be a little bigger.

The 16MB card should be at least a 64MB with it being a 4-Megapixel Camera.

There is no Diopter adjustment for the viewfinder.

<b>My Recommendations</b>
If you have to have a 4-Megapixel Camera for a low price than this camera does produce good photo quality for indoor and outdoor shots. It is easy to use!

If you can&#146t print any larger than an 8 x 10 inch photo then I highly recommend a 3-Megapixel Camera for about the same cost with a lot more options and better looks.
