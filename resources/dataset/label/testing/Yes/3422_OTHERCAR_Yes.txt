            The CLK Cabriolet is truly a Mercedes and truly a convertible.  It is stylish, powerful, luxurious, and pretentious enough to be a Mercedes.  The mostly-automated convertible top and seating for four make the CLK Cabriolet a fun vehicle for a summery Saturday afternoon drive with your three favorite yuppies.

The car is not as agile as a BMW, but it is powerful.  Despite how heavy the car is (~4000 pounds), it is relatively responsive.  Behind the back seat are two roll-bars which automatically raise if the car tips over.  

The year 2000 models are offering a tracking system option.  This would allow your car to be located, say if you were broken down at the side of the road.  It would automatically go off if you got in an accident and your airbags deployed.  Some people are wary of this feature because they do not want to be &quot;tracked&quot;, as if big brother is watching.  I personally think it's a great feature and can be very useful.

The trunk space is good when the top is up, small when the top is down (too small for even a set of golf clubs when the top is down).<br><br>
