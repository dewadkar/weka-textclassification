            I've been wanting a digital camera for some time now, and now that Christmas is just around the corner.. I set out on a mission.  The objective: convince the hubby that a digital camera would not only be the perfect gift, but that it would be useful and inexpensive.

I'd done my research, and was lucky enough to run across a Wal-Mart ad for the Polaroid PDC-640 for $149.  I showed it to my husband and he was surprised at the low price for a digital camera, especially one with an LCD screen.  

So off to Wal-Mart he went, but there were no PDC-640s in sight.  He did, however, notice a Polaroid PDC-700 for just $30 more.  He came home and asked me what the difference was in the two.  Off to the net I went.  

With an expanded resolution of 1024x768 (compared to the 640x480 of the PDC-640), twice the onboard memory of the PDC-640 (4MB instead of 2)and the addition of a USB interface to download pictures to your computer.. the PDC-700 is well worth the extra $30.  

So we went back to Wal-Mart and bought one Saturday.  It's Wednesday now and I've already taken over 100 pictures with my camera.  Inside photos of people, outside photos of the vehicles, my niece and nephew playing in the snow, and christmas lights at night are just a few examples of the many various types of photos I've taken, and they all turned out brilliant. 

Be warned, the camera will go through the included set of Duracell Ultra batteries quickly.  This problem is easily solved by purchasing a set of NIMH rechargeable batteries and a charger (Wal-Mart sells a set of 4 AA batteries and a charger together for around $15 - look near the cameras for Quest batteries).  There is also an AC adapter included which can be used indoors without requiring any battery power. If you use the LCD screen as a viewfinder, you'll run your batteries down faster.  To counter this, use the regular viewfinder, the camera will turn the LCD on briefly after pressing the shutter button to show you what your picture will look like and give you the option to erase it.
 
Everything you need is included in the camera kit.  You get the camera, camera case, wrist strap, 4 Duracell Ultra AA batteries, AC adapter, serial adapter, USB adapter and a video cable that lets you show or record your photos through your TV or VCR!  They also include Polaroid's PhotoMAX Image Maker software as well as the more robust PhotoMAX Pro.  

While I haven't used the serial cable to download photos yet, the USB interface is extremely easy to use.  Just plug it into your camera and computer, start up the Image Maker software and click &quot;Get Photo&quot; and &quot;From Camera&quot;.  A screen comes up showing thumbnails of the photos stored on your camera and you can select the ones you want to transfer to your computer.  You can even delete photos off the camera and change the camera settings from the software.  What could be simpler?

If you're looking for an entry-level digital camera with a few extras, this is the camera for you.  At a price of $179 (at Wal-Mart), it's better featured than the cheaper digitals, but still affordable.  

...and they also make great Christmas gifts!<br><br>
