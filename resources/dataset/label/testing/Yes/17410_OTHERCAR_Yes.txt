              I bought this car for my 50th birthday present - a gift to myself - seeing I am a single Mom!  This vehicle will be 2 years old this February and it looks and rides like new.  I LOVE IT.  I used to drive a Maxima and when looking for a new car I sat in several different makes/models - including a Volkeswagon convertible (fun car) - 

Once I sat in my 4Runner there was no turning back.  I continued to look at utility vehicles but always came back to Toyota.  The sun roof, radio, CD player, seats, etc., are all perfect.  In my household there is only myself and my teenager daughter (who drives a Pathfinder) so the vehicle is something we really didn't need - but I would buy another one tomorrow if it were time to purchase a new car. 

The car rides smooth, turns easy, seats are comfortable and I feel safe.  My daughter also feels much safer in the 4Runner - she states her Pathfinder doesn't hold the road as well, especially in the rain.

The only draw back for having this great 4Runner is my daughter!  Just about every day she asks if she can take my car.  She states she feels safer and loves the sound from the CD Player.
