            These cars are one of the nicest cars out when they are stock, but when you see all the things you can add to them they are the best. Ground effects, rims, lowering springs. and all types of performance.Or you can even leave them stock and feel good in your car.
The 2000 Prelude is a 2-door, 4-passenger compact sport coupe available in two trims, the Coupe and Type SH. The Prelude's closest competitors include the Toyota Camry Solara, Mitsubishi Eclipse and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Upon introduction, both trims are equipped with a standard 2.2-liter, I4, 200-horsepower engine that consumes 22-mpg in the city and 27-mpg on the highway. A 5-speed manual transmission with overdrive is standard on both trims, while a 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive and sequential sportshift is optional on the Coupe. The 2000 Prelude is a carryover from 1999 with added colors. <br><br>
