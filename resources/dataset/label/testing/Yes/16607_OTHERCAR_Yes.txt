            I bought my Cavalier Wagon because of the room, I keep it because its the most dependable and trustworthy car I have ever owned. I live where the weather get below zero every winter. And my Cavalier has never refused to start, even when the neighbors new car [that was kept in a garage] wouldn't.
 As with all cars there is upkeep but nothing that wouldn't need done on every car manufactored today. There's room for two adults,three kids[teenagers] and the family dog with room to spare.
 Mine is an automatic with front wheel-drive and has never refused a hill with winter deep snow on it. There's enough weight in it so that it handles beautifully and manuevers well.
 Its also a great car to teach the kids to drive in. Mine has a two.o liter engine which means that its a four-cylinder engine that has power to spare. 
The only bad thing I can say about it, is that it gets closer to the ground as I get older!
