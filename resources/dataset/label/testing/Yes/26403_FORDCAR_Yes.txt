            We bought our 1996 Ford Windstar van about a year ago for around 15k.  It is probably the one car purchase I have never thought, &quot;wonder if I could have done better&quot;.  The van is roomy and comfortable for five kids on long road trips.  I could stand the front bucket seats to be a tad more comfortable after a few hours, but they are not bad at all.  The van we purchased had the floormat option which means the kids' accidents are easily removed (or replaced if need be).  There are cupholders for most, but not all seating positions that fit a variety of drinks.  The engine is powerful, and responds well and I'd have to agree with those who say it is like driving a car.  With the automobile style hood it is easy to do routine maintenance (unlike some of the vans that seem to have everything crushed in a six inch space) and the engine compartment does not have to intrude into the passenger area.  There are heating/AC and stereo controls for backseat passengers, but they are thoughtfully provided with a driver override.  The rear window vents are also remove controlled from the front as well.  Also with five kids I was impressed with the government crash test scores!

The worst parts of the vehicle are that I do not really like the seatbelt arrangements for buckling car seats in place, although I feel this is probably a personal bias because I am used to buckling them in without a shoulder belt.  I have to admit the locking belt ratchet (pull the belt all the way out and it locks in place like the old style seat belts) is a lot better than the infant seat &quot;clip&quot; Ford used to use.  We also had to have the brake pads on the front replaced at around 35,000 miles, but I've heard this is normal and was not that big a deal for us.  Finally, I wish that I had one of the later models where the driver's door was a little longer to provide access to the back.  Again, not a big deal and I prefer not to have the second sliding door since this is where we belt an infant and I like the solid body by him.  Oh one other thing, this is not a compact and you'll know it at the gas pump.  It costs me about $24.00 to fill it, but I do not believe it is worse than any other mini-van out there.

All in all I would highly recommend this vehicle.  Roominess, easy maintenance, driving ease, and comfort far outweigh the one or two things I wish were different about it.<br><br>
