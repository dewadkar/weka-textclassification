            I started doing daycare and soon realized that my sports sedan wasn't going to cut it.  I really didn't want a minivan, but none of the SUV's could offer what a minivan could, good gas mileage and lots of people room.  We looked at all the minivans on the market and bought a 1999 Nissan Quest SE with leather, cd changer, power seats, and a tv/vcr.  I love the way this van handles, its great no matter what the weather or road conditions, its more like driving a car than a minivan.  The engine could use a bit more power, it tends to run out of steam if I have to pass someone on a hill, but all in all is fine for regular highway and city driving.  I drive a lot, I have had the van for 5 months and have put 15,000 miles on it.  The leather seats are luxurious and very comfortable, I love the memory seat option, makes adjusting the seat after my husband drives very easy.  The sound system is great, I have both CD and tape, plus a 6-disc changer.  The sunroof is huge.  So far I have had little problems with it, which add up and get annoying quick, it seems to like to go through lights very quickly, one headlight has been replaced and now the lens on the cornering light fell off and will need to be replaced.  Other than that, it has had 3 recalls which are a hassle to deal with.  I don't regret buying this van, its fun to drive and reliable.  I average around 22 mpg on the highway and 19 in the city, slightly lower in the winter.  This van is a great compromise if you need people room but prefer to drive a car, its actually quite fun to drive.<br><br>
