            I purchased this camera for my husband as a Christmas gift and it has been a blast!

First of all, I like the compact, lightweight retro design of the camera body. The controls are easy to use and the red-eye reduction has been splendid. The LCD is large and I use it pretty much all of the time. The only bad thing about that is that it really sucks up the battery power when it's used. If you only use the viewfinder your batteries will pretty much last forever. Luckily, it came with batteries and a charger.

This camera is easy to use, takes wonderful pictures with exceptional color and white balance, and has the added ability to take black and white photos as well. The resolution is incredible and it will print photo-quality pictures up to 11x14. There are some excellent features in this camera, one being that it's the first in its class to have full manual capability, a must for close-up shots. My personal favorite is the QuickTime(tm) feature. It allows for up to 60 seconds to be filmed and these can easily be converted to MPeg format. I was sad that it didn't have the ability to record any sound with it, but for the price I paid for this camera it would have been pushing the envelope. It also has an optional zoom lens and attachment kit that can be purchased but I don't have that yet.

Compared to other, similar cameras, the Olympus 2020 appears to have better quality resolution and the SmartCard storage is a good format for the data. The memory cards are also cheaper than some of the others which is a plus to me. I don't like that the lens rolls out and the lens cap was lost in less than 3 weeks. I wish it was attached like many other cameras are. I also wish it came with the USB port cable.

Even taking into account the very minor flaws this product has, I feel it was worth every penny and am enjoying it immensely.<br><br>
