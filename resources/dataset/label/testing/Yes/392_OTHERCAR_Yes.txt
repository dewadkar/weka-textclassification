                I'll be honest.  I bought this car mainly because I like the way it looks.  I think it's a really cool looking suv.  However, in the time since I've had this car, it's really grown on me.
    For one, it drives very smooth.  In fact, for an suv it's got one of the best rides out there.  It's also very quiet.  Not so much as a smaller luxury car mind you, but it does keep out much noise.
    Another nice feature is the integrated first aid kit.  Now this probably doesn't seem like that big a deal, however when you get right down to it, it is always nice to have a first aid kit around, and if it can be built in to the car, why not, right?  The only downside of this is that the rear of the vehicle is slightly depressed where the first aid kit is.
    It's also fairly reasonably priced.  about 23,000 for the base model, it's a fairly good value.<br><br>
