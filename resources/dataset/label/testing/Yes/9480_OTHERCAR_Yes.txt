            i waited along time to get this truck. it was everything i wanted in a 4x4 pickup. The off road package is a serious off road pkg.(not just a decal like some other makes)This pkg has skid plates everywhere, beefed up axles, off road shocks, and best of all a factory lift aprox.2". This makes room for the 17" wheels and tires. This truck rides and performs like a truck. No soft ride here. This is very true in my case. I have a regular cab, short bed. I had to have some repairs done in the first year, all of which were covered under warranty. The steering column was replaced, due to "clunking noise" / and the computer was reprogrammed due to engine pinging. Other than those repairs, its just normal maintenance. My one main problem was the factory goodyear GSA tires. These tires are junk for this truck! They feathered on the outside edge, worn out extremely to fast. And goodyear is the only tire company with an exact size replacement. 275-70-17. These tires were well maintained, always checked air pres, rotated every oil change. Well the last thing i wanted to do was buy the same junk again. I held out and now BFGoodrich makes the all terrain (also the mud terrain) in a slightly larger size 285-70-17. It was worth waiting, I now have these tires on the truck and quite happy with them. This is a great truck that will do most anything you ask of it. Its very versitale, i've hauled dirt, mulch, rocks, pulled out a friend's S-10 from a snow bank, and it still gets the groceries. :) I will keep this truck forever, more so now that they have changed the body and suspension on the newer models.
