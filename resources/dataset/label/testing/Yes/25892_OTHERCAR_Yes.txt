            I bought my 1998, 2.0 L automatic Plymouth Breeze from a relative 15 months ago, and have had no problems with it.  I got really lucky with this purchase, because the car had only 1000 miles on it, and it was exactly the car I had been planning to buy.

There are a lot of features that I really like about the Breeze.  I get very good gas mileage (22 city, 25 or so Highway).  The interior is much more roomy than you might expect from looking at the outside. I thought that the interior space would be similar to that of the Plymouth Sundance, which was my previous car, but actually it is more along the lines of the Dodge Spirit's interior space. 

The trunk space in the Breeze is SUPERB.  I travel for work quite frequently, and need to have ample space to store my luggage.  The Breeze will comfortably fit 2 large suitcases, my laptop, and a set of golf clubs.

My friends appreciate the spaciousness of this car as much as I do. I am planning a drive to Chicago this weekend (a 6 hour drive from my home)with 3 friends, and every single one of them asked if I would mind us driving my car up there because there is room for everyone AND their luggage.  

Another important thing to note about the Breeze is that it is a good car for hauling kids around, with or without carseats.  It is easy to get children in and out of the car quickly, which is an important quality in a family car.  As a matter of fact, since I like to drive cars for many years, the issue of transporting children was a factor in my decision, since I am 25 and it is feasible that I might get married and have kids while I own this vehicle.

The only thing that I would even consider changing about my car is getting the 2.4 L instead of the 2.0 L engine, so that I could have a bit more pickup.   However, I know from driving 2.4 L rentals that the difference is not all that dramatic, so I won't be doing anything crazy like trading my current one in on another just to get a 2.4.

I said in the title that I planned to drive the car for years, and I will.  I come from a family that believes cars are a mode of transportation more than a social status statement, and we always drive our cars for years.  I plan to do the same with my Breeze.<br><br>
