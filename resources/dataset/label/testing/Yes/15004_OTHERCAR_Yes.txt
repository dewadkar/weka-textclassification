            I purchased this camera when the digital camera craze began.  I went with Sony primarily because of their position in the electronic industry.  Using a floppy to store the pictures on is a novel idea, no small memory cards, or wires to hook to your computer.  Just pop the floppy in the drive and you're home free.  You can also view the picture right there on the camera itself.  A feature I find very attractive.  Anyone can use this camera, it's fairly easy to understand.  However, you can find difficulties if you don't read the manual or follow it's simple directions.  The menu makes things extremely nice, nothing hidden everything is up front.  It even formats pictures for e-mails or bitmaps.  I haven't checked on any accessories other than the shoulder strap and carrying case.<br><br>
