              I bought my '99 4-door Chevy Cavalier LS basically because it was fairly cheap.  I didn't want a piece of junk, but I was limited in the amount I could spend on a car.  With rebates and all, I got the car for about 13000.  If you don't have the money to buy a Cadillac or BMW and you are lookin for something in that price range, the Cavalier is an excellent choice.  
  I've had no problems with the car in the year that I've had it.  And it's excellent on gas (which is an important factor to consider with the sudden inflation in gas prices!).  I spend about $10-12 a week on gas and that is commuting to college everyday plus going to church and shopping and all kinds of things.
