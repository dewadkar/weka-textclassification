            As a college student, I decided to take my first step towards adulthood by purchasing my first "new" car. My previous cars included a 1985 BMW 325, a 1987 BMW 325i convertible and a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. 

My last three cars were all TERRIBLE. While they looked stylish, they simply had too many mechanical problems. Quirk here, engine trouble there... a high school kid can only afford to fix so much! I figured that with all the money I had put into repairs over the years, I could have made monthly payments and have bought a nice newer car. My mom has a 1995 Toyota Previa, which at 130,000 miles still has a single thing to go wrong. So I decided to keep with the Toyota marque. 

So the Rav4. 

I found my 2001 Titanium Metallic Rav4 L package in December. It had 24,500 miles on it already, and my parents had no doubt in their mind that that was not going to be an issue. "A drop in the bucket" my father said. In the 5 weeks that I have owned it, I have put on 5,000 miles already! And this is what I have concluded:

The exterior is flawless. I have the L package because the difference of color-coordinated door handles vs. the black plastic handles and the addition of fog lamps makes a HUGE difference. I notice people making double takes when i drive by. It's just a stunning package. 

The interior mimics the exterior and captures its sporty flavor. Typical Toyota interior (which is most definitely a good thing). No unsightly gaps, broken interior pieces or cheap plastics (very common in my previous Jeep). There is nothing to say but QUALITY. Having test driven various cars, the "clickiness" of my Rav4's turn signals, windshield wiper stalk, cruise control, shifter, heating a/c controls feel like they are coming from a car that costs thousands more. They put quasi-brushed aluminum touches on the a/c heater ducts, around the radio and around the shifter. It adds a sporty/classy flair. Niiiiiice. The seats are exceptionally comfortable, not to stiff, nor to firm. The fabric is of high quality, and easily cleanable (very important)! There are cubbys EVERYWHERE: one on each door, two for coins, a drawer underneath the power mirror switch, a padded cubby underneath the steering wheel perfect for holding envelopes, one in radio, one in the armrest, and three in the trunk visible and one "hidden" magic cubby underneath the mat (perfect for jumper cables). 4/5 seats of adjustable headrests, and I imagine they left out the 5th one because it woudl block rearward vision... But thoughtfully, Toyota created "real seat belts" for all 5 passengers. The middle back seat seat belt comes out of the ceiling! Clever! It also stores back in the celing when its not needed. The backseat is one of the most ingenious designs I have ever seen. The back seat is split in two. Each half can recline (a huge praise from my passengers), flip up, flip out, slide forward for more cargo room, or slide back for more rear leg room. 

My driving impression: The car is exactly everything I wanted/needed. I could argue that the engine needs more power... especially coming from a torquey 4.0L Jeep (that was FAAAAAAAAAAST!). But i knew that from the test drive, and knew that buying the car. In consequence, I am getting a decent MPG (anywehre between 21 - 26 MPG). The car has a short wheelbase, and it makes for the simplest parallel parking I have ever tried. Its just plain "zippy," its compact size makes it flingable, and its handling is right on par. The Rav4 has the best steering wheel I have ever used, no ifs ands or buts. Nice and beefy, I DARE you to compare! The automatic transmission is smooth, again typical toyota. I have gotten a few oppurtunities to test out my permanent 4 wheel drive systems. It's flawless. I've driven in snow as high as 5 inches, and Rav4 tracked straight and true. The best part is I dont have to engage and levers or worry about putting 4wd on at the wrong time... It's always on! I love the fact that i can use regular grade gas. Finally, in my 5,000 miles of ownership, I have had NO problems. 5,000 miles in one month is a LOT of work on poor Rav4, but she has been good. Exactly what i was looking for. Toyota owner for life...

and for my nitpicks... I too, was affected by the infamous "dash rattle." Luckily, a search on the internet showed that this was a common occurence in the Rav4, and there was a fix. What they didn't tell me was that while the Toyota dealer would "fix" it, they really wouldn't. OOh! And dont get me started about toyota dealer service! If there really is a hell on earth, I have found it! I found somebody's webpage and followed their solution for a self-fix; The rattle has been gone ever since. The headrests move. The intermittent windshield wipers only have one setting, and cannot become faster or slower. The backseat moves forward and back, but really only has 3 postions: all the way back, half way back, all the way front. The powerband for driving power takes some getting used to. The power comes at pretty high RPM (70MPH = 3,100 RPM), and if you tax the engine to get some passing power, Rav4 will whine VERY VERY AUDIBLY. While she's doing so, the interior plastic parts all buzz together. Not to say that she is weak, my baby has done 94 uphill on a mountain... and while it wasn't the quietest endeavour, she made it fine. =) Finally, the heated mirrors are something I have begun to love to hate. They are very useful in defogging your mirrors in the snow or rain, but there is no seperate control for them. They turn on when you turn on your rear defroster. Sometimes, my rear defroster still requires defrosting, but the mirrors are so hot that the water droplets dry on the mirror clouding them over dirtily... Finally: the gas guage is too vague. It works, but when it says that 1/2 is left, more like 5/8 is left. And the refuel light comes up at around 1/8 left (2 gallons remaining = 50 more miles!) All small nitpicks folks, I know. 

final word: I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my car a thousand times over!
