            Ok just three weeks ago my Subaru Wagon finally died and although I knew it was dying I was still unprepared to buy another car!  But fate stepped in on Fathers Day and my car died.

So the first thing I did was call my Mom.  I knew she had a car for sale that was her new husbands car.  I also new it was a Cadillac and assumed the price would be to much even from my Mom.  Well we negotiated and worked out a deal.  Which made me the new owner if a 1990 Cadillac Deville.  

I was thrilled with this car from the moment I sat down.  The 8 way adjustable seat gave me a comfortable perch to drive in.  I was amazed that the seat goes up and down so that my 6"4' husband and my 5"4" self could both drive comfortablly!

The tilt steering wheel is a great feature because I can adjust it up so that I can get in and out easier.  I also love the adjustable washer delay.  There are 5 different delay settings and that is a great conveinence when the rain is just drizzling down.

The sun visors have a added side visor for those days when the sun is just slightly to your back and is peaking past your visor.  The front hood also has a feature where I can see if my blinker is on, my head lights, or brights, without having to look down at the panel. 

The smooth ride of this car is incomparable.  It runs quiet and the get up and go, GETS UP AND GOES!!  I have also been pleased with the gas mileage.  The miles per gallon varies between 18 - 25.  Which I think is great for how solid the car is.  I especially like the hydralic shocks that automatically balance the car no matter how uneven the load is.

I think this car will be a blessing come this winter with it's all wheel drive and airbags.  If you have an opportunity to own a Cadillac do not pass it up.  Buying a Caddy is one decision you will never regret!!!
