            I decided after years of riding busses and bumming rides, that it was time to finally get a car of my own.  I wanted something reliable which for me, made for a short list to test drive.  Honda's reliability is legendary, so the Civic naturally made it on to my list.  The Civic won out over the other cars that I looked at because it's diminutive size (yet spacious interior), speed and looks could be had at a more reasonable price than many competitors.  I live in the city, where the 2000 Civic seems to be right at home - parking is a breeze.  I went for the sporty Si model, and haven't regretted it since.

<b>Raves</b> - The engine is sublime.  This baby screams to its 8,000 rpm redline.  When I first showed it to my friends and they commented on how I revved the engine.  Then I let them drive it... they couldn't resist either.  This car begs to be driven.  However, it was the upgraded suspension, more than the added power that sold me on the Si Model.  This car handles twisty roads with ease.  Need to pass?  Just downshift (using the very light, precise shifter and smooth clutch) and push the pedal.  It has a definite split personality.  Around town, it behaves like a normal Civic.  Push the RPM's past 6K, and it turns into an aggressive, almost insatiable speed demon.

The interior is plenty big, I fit four with no complaints.  The trunk is huge.  The styling is conservative, with only a red 'Si' badge, a chrome exhaust tip, alloy wheels, and a few other minor trim bits differentiating the Si from the lesser Civics.  This is not necessarily a bad thing mind you (think Highway Patrol...).  The layout of the interior is incredible, everything easy to see and reach, typical Honda.

<b>Rants</b> - The engine can be noisy, especially when you put your foot in it, but the noise is a good one.  The big problem with this car is road noise.  I'm told by my dealer that this is a common Civic complaint, and the sporty suspension in the Si exacerbates the problem.  You can't have a conversation with anyone in the back seat.  I just turn up the 6-speaker CD system and/or pop open the sunroof, and that helps.

If you do a lot of adventurous driving, you will burn through fuel rapidly.  This wouldn't be much of an issue (it gets wonderful mileage considering), but the Civic Si is one of the few Honda models that actually takes premium unleaded fuel.  Also, the engine runs fast at freeway speeds.  A taller sixth gear for better economy would be appreciated.

Anti-theft.  My car was stolen only 3 weeks after purchase.  Hondas are known for this, I knew this when I bought it, but Honda could make some simple redesigns to help the problem.  The ignition should be moved from the steering column to the dash, this makes it less accessible to thieves.  Also, the power door lock switches need to be recessed so that they can't be tripped by a bent coat hanger shoved down a cracked window.

<b>Overall</b> - I'm very happy with my decision.  My dealer (Honda of Seattle) has been incredibly good to me as far as service, and I'm confident that this baby will still be running long after I've paid it off.  The problems are minor, and the plusses are great.  This is one of Honda's best kept secrets, as they didn't advertise this model very much.  There is no Si for the 2001 year, although it may resurface.  All I know is, it never fails to put a smile on my face when I drive it.  In fact, I find myself leaving Seattle and heading for the Cascade Mountains just so I have room to have some fun with the car.  Not bad, for a car well under $20K...<br><br>
