              My husband bought our little Omni as a second car when a friend put it up for sale asking only $250.  My first impression of the car was that it looked like it had been rode hard and put up wet.  My assumption was that it wouldn't be very reliable because it had such high mileage and looked rough.  I even tried to talk my husband out of giving the $250 for it.  Many times since that day, our little Omni has proved my first impression wrong.

  The Omni has 150k on it, under the hood it's pretty atrocious, and it has more paint peeled off of it than it has on it.  While it's no luxury car by far, it's one heck of a reliable work vehicle.  Every time my shiny, snazzy red convertible left me stranded, my family never had to worry about transportation because of our diehard Omni. (This means alot coming from me, being a &quot;beautiful car enthusiast&quot;)

  The Omni is a small car, but the interior is roomy enough for four.  The hatchback comes in very handy for loading up after shopping.  We get great gas mileage and the little car has never needed more than the usual upkeep.  It drives well, although it's not a race car.(70mph is the fastest you'll want to drive for a smooth ride)

  There are a couple of little quirks here and there, as I imagine there are with any vehicle, but they're minor.  For example, the door handles become weak with wear and may eventually need replaced.  The paint job is not the best, but regular waxing may prevent future problems.  As a whole the little Dodge Omni is a smart, reliable car with no serious or reoccuring problems that I've found.  Pick one up as a second car!  It'll always be there to rescue you when your Beautiful-but-Bastardly car deserts you.
