            I really love this digital camera. It is one of the better ones around. I must refer to watsupdad's opinion on this camera because mine is very similar. It is an amazing camera with so many different features to it. I love the fact that I am able to delete pictures, view pictures, and do other amazing things to the pictures. I also love the fact that it can hold lots of pictures (i believe up to 50) If I was an interested buyer in digital cameras, this would be one of my top priorities. The one thing that is bad about this camera, like watsupdad said, is the battery life. For me, it has only lasted 2 hours fully charged. I wish it could be a little longer. Another bad thing is it takes a long time for the camera to actually take the picture after you hold down the button. Overall, I believe this is the best digital camera around.<br><br>
