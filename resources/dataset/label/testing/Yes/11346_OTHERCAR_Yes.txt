            We bought the Dodge Grand Caravan second hand when it had 40,000 miles on it.  Ours has a 3.3 liter V-6.  

We have four children ages 1-6.  So we needed a van that was safe, reliable, child friendly and not too cost prohibitive.  I think the Dodge Grand Caravan has all of that.  Ours has the two integrated child seats and the two sliding doors.  I was worried that having the two doors would make the children tempted to try to open them more often.  But they have never tried.  Plus you can use the child door locks if needed.  The child safety seats are invaluable! I would always recommend buying them! It is SO nice not to have to move the carseat in and out or have the bulk of it in the van.  The seat can be folded up very EASILY if not needed as well.  The van is easy to get in and out of also.

I would not get the Dodge regular size caravan because there was no room for luggage when we test drove them.  They just seemed so much smaller.  

The only thing I can say that i don't like on the Grand Caravan is that if you are sitting in the last seat it is hard to open the door and get out.  This is because the middle seatbelt positioning is on the side door so you sort of have to duck under it and the position is awkward to open the door.

All in all the van is wonderful.  I will not hesitate to buy another one.  I think we will buy a new one next time.  It is well worth the cost to have a reliable vehicle!<br><br>
