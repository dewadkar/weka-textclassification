            A few years ago I purchased a used LaBaron convertible thinking I had finally gotten the car I always wanted.  I did enjoy it but noticed a lot of road noise and didn't like the small trunk space.  It just so happened the day I bought it, I saw a Sebring for the first time and wished I could buy that instead.  As I said, I did enjoy the LaBaron but in the back of my mind was the picture of that cute Sebring.  Now, two years later, I could stand it no longer.  I staked out the Chrysler dealership watching for Sebrings on the lot.  I talked to a salesman who told me more cars were coming in the next morning.  I arrived as did the truck with MY car sitting up on top!  It is dark green with a black cloth top and grey velour interior.  Perfect!  It is the Jxi model so comes with keyless entry, automatic trunk release, power windows and door locks, power seat adjustments, and pure comfort.  It sounds solid when the doors close and there is not the road noise like the LaBaron.  It is a dream to drive!  One other nice feature is that there is a computer chip in the key which allows only that key to start the ignition!  Clever!  All in all, I can't say there are any negatives and many positives.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a convertible!<br><br>
