            We purchased this camera almost 4 years ago. This was a spontaneous purchase, with no knowledge as to what to look for. This is one of the best things we have ever bought! Granted, it may not take the quality photo that a professional photographer may want, but for an amateur it is terrific. Easy to use, for sure. It is the only camera on the market that uses a plain old 3.5&quot; floppy disc. We usually get about 25 pictures per disc, &amp; if we want to take more pictures than we had planned on, the discs are available anywhere. I would stay away from any camera that requires you to download them into your computer. This could leave you without your camera, unless you plan on taking a computer with you on a trip. Plus, pictures can take a lot of room on precious hard drive space. If you take a picture that you don't like...simply delete it &amp; re-use the space. Because we have the actual viewer, we can see that the picture is there &amp; just what we wanted. No more waiting until the film develops to find out there is a blur, or that somebody walked in front of the camera as the picture was being taken. One thing to keep in mind is that this isn't a regular camera, &amp; we hardly ever use a flash, even indoors.

     
If you are serious about doing good photos...make sure that you have a great printer &amp; use photographic paper. This makes a huge difference. Most people cannot believe the quality of the photos we have taken. Close-ups are especially great with this camera.
