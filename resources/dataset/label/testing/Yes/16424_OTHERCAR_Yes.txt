            As a beginner in digital camera (my yahoo one doesn't really count...), my new Coolpix 775 had really amazed me. It has been a period of time that I had fool around with the camera, and there's a lot can be played around with the camera.

First off, for beginners like me, the number of pixels this camera offer is enough for point and shoot purpose. Many of the time, setting the camera in taking pictures in size of 1024x768 resolution is more than enough. With a 64MB Compact Flash, the camera can already take 305 photos using normal quality. Indeed, this camera offer 3 quality levels in 3 sizes: Fine, Normal, and Basic; Full(1600x1200), XGA(1024x768), and VGA(640x480). If I set the camera to VGA using Basic quality, the camera can even take more than 1000 pictures! Also, all pictures are saved as JPEG in the memory card. There's also a mode that takes 16 pictures each 400x300 in resolution continuously, then combine to a 1600x1200 resolution picture!

Then there's the capability of taking video clips of 15 seconds each. Manual says that the camera can take videos up to 40 seconds but from what I experienced, 15 seconds is the maximum. Although there's no sound recorded for the video, it's really a nice feature for the camera. One thing that has to be careful of is that enough light is necessary else the video will come out a bit darker. Actually, video is still acceptable when taken at night in a room only lighted up by a 100W light bulb, but the video come out a bit yellowish due to the color of the bulb.

This camera comes with a very nice LCD screen on the back. All settings can be seen in the screen and control using a four points cursor near the it. When the camera is set to the play mode, pictures taken can be viewed through the screen. All picture can be even zoomed in at 2x for more detailed viewing. One very nice feature is the ability to play a slide show of all pictures in the compact flash. Time length for each picture can be set and then the camera will just play back all pictures automatically. Video can also be reviewed in this mode.

This camera comes equiped with 8 different modes for taking pictures. Each individual mode contains a specific setting for specific places and times. For example, there's a sunset mode that turns off the flash light and set the camera to capture the redish color of sunset, an indoor mode that let flash on and tune the white balance more suitable for indoor pictures, scenary mode and etc. Only one thing is that setting for each mode is set and can't be changed except Auto mode. When the camera is in Auto mode, everything from exposure all the way to white balance and flash control can be manually set to the outcome needed. Every setting is very easy to understand and to use that even me as a beginner have no problem getting my desired output, especially taking pictures of scenaries at night when flash has to be turned off. All my friends are amazed of how well the camera's output quality is!

There's not much bad things about this camera so far. It's only that the battery doesn't last very long, though it can manage to survive a day of *normal* photo takings and turning on and off the camera everytime. Battery life is still acceptable but a second battery is really handy. Afterall, the advantage of having a digital camera is that there's no need for photo processing. I can take as many photos as I like without a worry of how many rolls of film needed to bring to Costco for photo process. So, a second battery is definitely recommended, especially with this camera, which can take photos every few seconds. One more thing that's missing from this camera is the missing of special effects. Personally I think this isn't a big deal as special effects can always be added to any photo anytime EASILY in a computer using all sorts of photo editing programs available everywhere online. There's nothing for me to whine about the camera's size as it is already small, sleek, and light in a silvery package.

In the end, all I can conclude is that this camera is great for its price. May be Sony's are better and Canon's are smaller. But when you combine some of the good stuff from Sony and Canon, Coolpix 775 is something close to what you get from that combination. So, for those who like the photo qualities of Sony's (I had a friend using Sony's, this camera's quality is enough to match those from Sony's) but want the small size of Canon's, Nikon's Coolpix 775 is there to fill in that gap for you!
