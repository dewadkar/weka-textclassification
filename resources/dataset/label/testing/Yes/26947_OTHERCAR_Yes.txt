            Earlier this year, I purchased my second Toyota Camry. After owning my
previous Toyota for five years, I found that it needed very few repairs in that time.  When it came time to purchase another vehicle, I had no qualms about buying another Toyota Camry.  The car handles well,
even in rough New England winters.  We enjoy the comfortable seating
and ample interior leg and head room. About the only negative aspect that I've experienced is that water will drip into the car after a rain
when the front windows are only slightly opened.  This can be rather annoying, but it wouldn't stop me from getting the same car all over again.  I highly recommend the Toyota Camry!<br><br>
