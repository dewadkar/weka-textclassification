            I choose my Hyundai Elantra because it was cute and economical. I travel 64 miles a day commuting to work and I needed a car that was economical. I found the Hyundai and it was what I was looking for.
The car runs great. Has great fuel economy. I spend about 20 bucks a week in gas. With todays gas prices that is quite economical.
I find the car to be quite roomy and comfy. The only downfall I have is when driving on the highway the ride does get quite noisy.
This car was in my price range and was well worth the money. I have put 15,000 miles on it in 5 months and all I have done is the normal maintenance. Oil change,refill washer fluid etc.
My Husband has a 1993 Hyundai excel with over 200,000 miles on it and it still runs like a top. This is one of the reasons we started looking for another Hyundai. We knew they were reliable and last a long time.
I just have the basics in my car. I do have AC. This feature works great in the warm weather.
The Hyundai Elantra has plenty of get up and go. I usually drive around 75 mph. I travel mostly on the highway and have never had any problems.
The stereo really cranks. For a inexpensive car the stereo has great sound quality.
I would recommend this car to anyone that wants cheap reliable transportation.<br><br>
