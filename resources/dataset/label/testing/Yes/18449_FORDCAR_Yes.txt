            1997 Ford Ranger Extended cab, I purchased new in 1997 and to date have had no major problems with it to date. (knock on wood)  A 4 cyl.engine,stick shift air and not much else. In the past 3-years I have had new brakes, tires and no major problems,however the small ones are such a headache. The wiring in this truck is the worst. After several attempts to correct a short that stops all the aux. plugs from working and keeps the dome light on at all times I have finally just pulled the fuse and learned to live without them. The center compartment has never closed properly and the drivers seat back has broke.But thats all,and after 90000 miles it still runs perfect. I hope that in the last 3-years Ford has made corrections to their wiring problems.

I would definitly buy another Ford in the future and would suggest to anyone currently looking for a light truck to check out the Ford ranger.

Now if I could only find a dealer who you can trust.<br><br>
