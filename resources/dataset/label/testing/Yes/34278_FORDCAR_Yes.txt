            This truck is an adventure every time that I step into it. First of all this is by far the larges vehicle that I've been into. The triton V8 engine is so powerful I feel as if I could take on any other car or truck in a race. Outside if you like trucks, it's one of the most beautiful trucks I've ever seen. The front foot room is large and would be big enough for a large sized man. In the back there is enough room for children or smaller adults. Overall this car is a great experience, the only disadvantage is parking this mammoth beast. Despite this fact I would recommend this car to anyone.<br><br>
