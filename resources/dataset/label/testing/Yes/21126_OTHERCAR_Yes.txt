            Not fifteen minutes ago I grabbed this camera, rushed to the banister and took a picture of my black lab from above, chewing on a dog biscuit. The sight amused me, because of late her more sedentary life style has produced a shape, from above, very like a grape. And I suddenly realized how much I use this digital camera every day, and have not yet even honored it with a review.So let me remedy my act of omission.

While many of us are gadget freaks, myself among them, there is something to be said for craftsmanship, and durability, not to mention ease of use. This particular camera offers a finely crafted lens from a known and respected distributor, and is nearly as easy to use as the cybershot Sony (point and shoot DSC 50, that I reviewed some time ago). How could you not love this camera? 

HERE'S THE $64,000 QUESTION:

<b><i> Why buy a digital camera with maximum resolution of only 3 megapixels when cameras of higher resolution are now "cutting edge?" </b> </i>

<i> The SIMPLE answer is because if you are like most people, even some of the professionals among you, you simply don't need a higher resolution than this.  But I know that answer isn't going to satisfy you..so let me give you some more reasons, and get this part of the review out of the way.</i>

<b> What IS available?</b> Sony's newest variation on the Cybershot series is the <b>DSC -F707</b>,  selling for about $ 1000 retail. It features about 5.24 megapixel resolution. I scanned the specs for the camera, and the styling and other features are similar to the DSC F 505. I also own a FUJFILM  <b>Finepix 4900Zoom</b> with a little over 4 megapixel resolution,  costing $795 dollars. The <b> DSC F 505 </b> can be bought for under $600, usually much less at auction. Most of the major Camera producers will have their own version of my two favorite cameras, and I urge you to check out the reviews posted here by on Epinions, by other ranters, raters and reviewers. 

<b>So why buy the one with only 3 megapixels?</b>

<b> 1. Utility </b> The higher the resolution, the more storage space you require. While this works great for the manufacturer of storage media, it doesn't work well for you as the photographer. A professional quality photograph can be printed from your computer with 2 or even less megapixel resolution.  I'll let you in on a little secret. Except in rare situations I shoot in standard to fine resolution. I don't get much more value from the higher resolution and nothing fills up your hard drive faster than super high resolution photos. I don't want to miss a one of a kind photo looking for some more digital film. If you are using a digital camera to communicate, the advantage of lower resolution will be obvious when you go to send a huge file image to someone who hasn't got twenty minutes for it to download.

<b> 2. Price </b> There is no better time to buy one of these cameras than right now. Even retail, in stores that carry them, you are likely to get a great deal, although I would probably start at Ubid, or EBay. If you wait until the last minute you may luck out and get a great deal, or you will be scrambling for the "last one in stock". I bought this one right after Christmas last year, and got a fantastic deal, buying it at under $500. 

<b>OTHER ADVANTAGES OF THE SONY DSC F 505</b>

<b> 1. Versatility. </b> Like all my other Sony cameras,(except the Point and Shoot which has an automatic flash) you  have the options of manual focus,  natural light or flash, and several "effect" modes, including Sepia shots, solarized shots , pictures taken as a "negative", and regular old color photos, as well as audio and video recording for movie mode. 
<b> 2. Ease of use </b> The camera weighs only 15 ounces, and the zoom lens rotates around the camera body 90 degrees up and down 50 degrees to allow some extra flexibility in your point of view. The controls are push button. The camera also has a vertical /horizontal sensor that orients whether the shot is a "landscape" or "portrait" , which will help later on when you are loading images to your PC.
<b>3. 3:2 aspect ratio </b> While this isn't something most ordinary uses would question, most digital cameras show a 4:3 aspect ratio. The 3:2 Aspect ratio corresponds to film camera proportions, that print more like "normal" conventional photos. This comes in handy when you are putting together albums, or making cards, or creating pictures for conventional picture frames.
<b>4. ZOOM </b> You get a 10x precision zoom (through the lens) and a 5 x optical zoom, which brings almost anything within your range for a picture. You can get all sorts of add -on lenses, but my experience proves to me that it probably isn't worth it, for the amount of compensation you have to calculate to over ride the automatic features of the camera. They either get distorted, or come out very dim. My advice: Get closer or play with it in your editing software.  There is a great MACRO feature, though, that will allow you to get as close as one inch to your subject.
<b>5. Storage Media/Digital Film </b> Uses the Sony Memory stick, which you can buy in all sorts of different storage capacities. The 'biggest' I have bought so far is 64 MB, and my battery would be dead long before I could fill the memory stick. ( I actually prefer the 32 MB, after a couple of years of use with other Sony Cameras, because the files are more manageable when downloading)
<b> 6. Flash </b> Pop up, not automatic, all within your control. Shoots about 13 feet, but range can be extended with external flash to 30 feet. The external  adapter is included in the camera design. You can also set up on a tripod, if that is your choice.
<b> 7. Playback </b> Includes an index mode, a slide show, which you can hook up to your TV for viewing, single image editing, including cropping, and some special file organization features, which are all very handy.
<b> 8. Durability </b> The camera is made of an alloy of magnesium and aluminum, which I have been unable to dent despite repeated battering.
<b>9. 2 inch LCD Monitor, "Hybrid"</b> You can turn off the backlit feature, and cut the use of power 20%, saving your battery, a big factor with a lot of use. Screen is of adequate size, and tough enough that I haven't damaged it yet
<b> 10 Sony Technology</b> Trademark Super HAD CCD, super scan with autofocus, which gives an interpolated image of 3.7 megapixels, by filling in data between pixels. It gives you added clarity of image. White balance, button operated, allows you to improve color saturation to approximate the colors you see. 
<b> 11. Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar Lens </b>, professional quality optics, with a lens coating that reduces glare, and substantially enhances detail, and improves contrast pick up.

THESE ARE THE STANDARD FEATURES/OTHER STUFF

The battery is standard info lithium for Sony products, the small version. Once fully charged it usually lasts about 2 hours, so I keep a spare. It is recharged quickly, in an hour, unless it is drained completely. You can download directly to your PC with a USB cable, but if you have Windows ME, you need to contact Sony for the new drivers. (I usually load them in the floppy adapter, and copy them as files.) I don't keep the memory stick as "exposed film". I recycle those to other uses. I keep some picture files stored in a photo web site on-line, and copy others to CD.

<b> What you get with your new camera</b>

<i> The camera

The BOX it came in.</i>

<b> The Bad Stuff </b>

Picture Gear software is a waste of time, and if you have more than one source of input from digital imaging, stick with one good editing program. I have one with the PHOTOSMART printer, that works for every day use, as well as <b> Picture it</b> Software for some special projects. Too many programs will prevent transfering your picture files to  different applications, and may result in some weird distortions.

One other minor drawback is the absence of a rangefinder image viewer, which works better for me in bright light. 

None of this software (for USB drivers) works with Windows ME or Windows 2000. You will have to contact Sony for the download, if you want to connect directly. I get around it by popping the memory stick in the floppy adapter and downloading the images as files (JPEG). It works for me!

You will be able to record only one high resolution image to your 4 MB Memory stick,so plan on acquiring one or two of at least 32 MB -64 MB range. I have bought a few on EBay for 35-40 dollars, and they work fine for all my cameras. 

(RESOLUTION REFERENCE FOR 4 MB MEMORY STICK)

HIGH -FINE  2240 X 1680 megapixels= 1 IMAGE 
NORMAL FINE 1600 X 1200 megapixels=  5-8 images
NORMAL STANDARD 1024-768 megapixels = 14-27 images
NORMAL E-MAIL   640x 480 megapixels = 27-38 images

<b>FINAL RECOMMENDATION </b>

I love this camera, no doubt about it. It tucks nicely into a pocket in my traveling lap-top dog -and- pony show, and is all the camera I usually need. It is light enough to be portable, but heavy enough so you'll notice if it is missing. I pack my SONY everywhere. I couldn't leave home without it.
