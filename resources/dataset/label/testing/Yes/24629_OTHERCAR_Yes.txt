            Just recently my parents purchased a 2000 Infiniti I30T, which included a sports package, and a amazing BOSE system.  Not only is this car classy, but it's one of the best drives known to man; in my opinion.  

When most people think of classy cars, they think of BMW's, Mercedes, and sometimes even Lincoln's.  But Infiniti is now making a name for itself in the market.  Not only is the Infiniti I30T have a fantastic smooth ride, it also hugs the road while it turns.  This car drives just as well as any other expensive car.  But something that me and parents both agreed on, is that the price is reasonably much less then any of these other Brand names.  

Also something that I really enjoyed about this car, is the remote for the alarm.  It includes this button that when pressed, your trunk pops open.  The remote can reach a good long distance, and through walls.  This car just makes life that much better, I just wished that everybody can enjoy this experience.  Go test drive one today!!!<br><br>
