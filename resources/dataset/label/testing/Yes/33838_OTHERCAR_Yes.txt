            Let me first preface this with the fact that I owned a Honda Prelude prior
to my 1993 Honda Accord.   Longevity of the Preludes's car life is what prompted me to purchase another Honda.  I purchased the 1993 Accord as a used vehicle. It had 95,000 miles on it when I bought it in 1996.  The high mileage did not bother me, because I knew that it could easily go another 100,000 miles. The previous owner had all the maintenance paperwork, so I knew it had been well taken care of.  Well, I still have that car 4 years later, and it only has 128,000 miles on it and still running fine.   The Honda is a good reliable vehicle.  However, I have found the same problem with this Accord as I had with my Prelude.   There is a slight continual vibration in the whole car that mechanics can't seem to &quot;fix&quot;.   By 166,000 my Prelude had screws coming out of the door panels from the vibrations.   But overall my used Honda Accord has been a great car.
