            I have been searching high and low for a good solid camera with an LCD viewer that would not break my bank account.  When I stumbled across this camera I was first concerned about the Agfa name....the Agfa eSmile is notorious for having the same quality as a cracker jack toy, so I began to do a bit of research.  

After reading the many positive reviews of this camera, studying the features, and doing price comparisons of other makes / models I decided to give this camera a spin.  

I purchased this camera from Buy.com for a song.......$159.  From the opening of the box this camera was a breeze to operate.  Solid sound construction that is complimented by much needed features such as red eye reduction, LCD viewer and the ability to view the pictures on demand. 

I use this camera heavily for online auctions and am continually impressed by its picture quality and the ability to take clear, crisp, up close pictures.  

The only downside to this camera?  Well as with all other digital cameras (especially with a LCD screen), it eats batteries.  So my recommendation get rechargables.  

So, if you are looking for a good, solid, INCREDIBLE camera check out the Agfa ePhoto 780c....you wont be sorry!  <br><br>
