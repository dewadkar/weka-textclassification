            Life can't get any better than this! After owning and using a casio QV 300 for 5 years I thought it was time for a better and up todate camera. Pictures are perfect,Great software and usb downloads are fast. Batteries are no longer a problem, my old camera ate batteries. I can shoot pictures for hours on a single charge. If you can use a computer with drop down menus this camera is a snap to learn. To end a arguement with some friends about 35mm verses digital I took some macro pictures of a bee on a flower and printed it on a 8xll glossy paper.All the die hard 35mm friends said they didn't know this kind of quality was available, and at this price!<br><br>
