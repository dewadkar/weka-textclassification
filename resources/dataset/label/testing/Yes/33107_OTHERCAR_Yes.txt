            This SUV is a great one by far.  My father owns a 1998 GMC Jimmy 2 door SLS 4x4 with all the options of a SLT except for the leather seats.  He paid about $22,000 for this, but it was new from the dealer.  

The ride in this SUV is immaculate.  It rides really soft, but has the 4300 Vortec engine in it to give it a huge speed burst for those who love to have that power but in a V-6 engine.  

Since this SLS has ALL the options like an SLT, it was a great buy since we didn't have to pay for the leather seats that many people didn't like, but got the moonroof, CD and cassette players, all power windows and locks, and even heated side mirrors.  This vehicle has every option that a person would want when buying an SUV.  

The Jimmy gets decent mileage, normally in the 15-18 range in the city and over 25 when driving on highways.  It has a decent capacity of a gas tank so you don't have to fill up as often as well.  

People who should buy this product are the SUV enthusiasts who want luxury but don't want leather seats in their car.  This is a very affordable SUV where you can have it all without paying a lot in the end for it.  Normally, a single guy or girl or a married couple should buy this vehicle since it's only a 2 door SUV. 

People who should not buy this model would be a family, since it only has 2 doors.  If this doesn't seem as a problem, then it's a great buy for all people.  

We purchased this SUV because of the GMC performance behind it, and we had previously owned a Chevy S-10 Blazer and wanted to stay within the GM products.  Also, we received many rebates on this vehicle which made it more affordable.
