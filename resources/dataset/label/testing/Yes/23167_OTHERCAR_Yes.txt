            I bought my brand new Dodge Ram 1500 in April, 1995.  I have put 94,000 miles on it and have had no major problems.  The only thing that has broken was the A/C Switch which froze on one cold morning.  It was quite expensive to fix, but otherwise nothing other than regular maintenance.

The biggest advantage of the truck is the roominess inside.  I have a regular cab and three very large men can sit comfortably in it.  I also have one child and a child safety seat, my wife, and I can all fit easily.  

The body style was new when I bought it.  Just looking at the front grill reminds you of a ram.  The grill appears to be metal, but in fact is plastic, which was somewhat a disappointment.  To work on the vehicle can be quite interesting.  My mechanics basically had to crawl inside the vehicle to change the serpentine belt.  By the way, it is virtually impossible for one person to change that belt in the Ram.  It takes three hands.  I also had to change the battery and the operation takes longer than the average battery change.  It appears to do any work on this vehicle takes extra time.

I love the long bed in my truck.  I don't regularly haul anything, but over the past 5 years, I have needed this capacity several times.  Originally I was looking for a small to mid-size truck, but for the minimal difference in cost, I thought it crazy to buy a smaller one.

The biggest drawbacks have been the paint, gas mileage and the recalls.  I get about 15 miles to a gallon of gas with my truck, which isn't all that bad for a truck, but as my regular vehicle that isn't good enough.  I have started using the truck as our third vehicle.  Over the five years, I guess there have been about fifteen recalls.  It seems like it's about one a quarter.  The paint on the vehicle has begun to start popping off.  I have been told that all the Chevy and Dodge trucks for 1995 are experiencing this problem because they didn't use a primer coat.

I definitely have enjoyed my truck and to do work or ride around town, it has been great.  If I were looking at buying this truck used, I would examine the paint closely.  The trend is for it to pop off.  My paint started popping off just over the headlights on the hood.  I would like to know if the owner took the trucks in for the recalls.  I would pay close attention to the way the truck changed gears and how the overall transmission reacted (there has been reportedly some problems with the transmissions).   Don't expect great gas mileage.  I have heard owners say anywhere from 8-20 mpg (15 for me).  For me it has been a good truck, and personally I would recommend it, but do pay attention to the potential pitfalls.
