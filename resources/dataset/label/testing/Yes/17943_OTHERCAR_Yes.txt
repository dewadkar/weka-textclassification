            I just bought a 98 wrangler and GOD! I LOVE IT!  It takes a special type of person to like/own one of these baby's!  I love having the wind in my hair and the sun shining down on my face as I'm cruising along.  I also love wheeling in my Jeep.  I don't mind the mud flying at all.  I welcome it!  It's such a cool feeling to drive down the road after wheeling with mud caked on!  Especially when I drive by another Jeeper.  That's another thing I like is the Jeep Wave!  The clearance and turning radius are unmatchable!  I've had to turn around on a few trails cuz my friends couldn't make it in there vehicles.  I can climb rocks and everything! (I'm a tomboy at heart) I'm so impressed with my jeep!  No way I'll ever drive anything else! <br><br>
