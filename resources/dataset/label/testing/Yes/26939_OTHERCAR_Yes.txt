            I leased a black 1998 Toyota Camry two summers ago.  After owning a car that had many maintenance problems, I really wanted a reliable vehicle.  The Toyota Camry is a very practical car.  I have been driving it for two years now, and it never gives me a moment's trouble.  The seats have thick cushioning which means that road trips are a pleasure.  I look forward to driving my Camry to work every morning, secure in the knowledge that it will be a comfortable and safe ride.

I test drove the Nissan Altima and the Honda Accord before making a purchase, and I found that the Camry had the quietest, smoothest ride.  Riding in this automobile is literally like gliding on air.  My friends can't even tell if the car is running when it's in park.  It doesn't make a sound!  The Honda Accord, in contrast, has an engine that roars like a freight train as you accelerate.  

Not only is the Camry comfortable and maintenance free, but it is packed with luxury features.  The include the following (some are optional):  remote entry device, security alarm, CD player, cruise control, air conditioning, leather interior, sunroof, front and rear drink holders, CD storage bin, etc.  The Camry has a wonderful amount of pick up as well, which is very handy if you do a lot of highway driving.  

In the rain and snow, the car handles surprisingly well, especially considering that it is not a four-wheel-drive vehicle.  Believe me, because I live in a cold climate, and I understand the importance of driving a car that doesn't slip and slide all over the road.  Anyone who wants a safe, reliable, comfortable, attractive sedan should get a Camry.  The only drawback to the car is that it costs a bit more than the Altima; however, in my mind, the quality justifies the cost.
