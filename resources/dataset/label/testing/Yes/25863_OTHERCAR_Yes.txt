            I first want to start off by saying how much i love Jeeps, and that i have owned 87 Commanche pick-up, 90 cherokee lmtd (just traded for 2000 Classic), my family has owned 2 87 limited, 97 Wrangler, 95 Limited, 97 Limited. Aside from some problems here and there (mainly my 90 limited, ABS , and obvious paint problems that everyone experianced i think. My family and i all love Jeeps and are dedicated to them .

A few months ago i traded in my 90 Limited for a 2000 Classic, with all options including up-country suspension, fog lamps, Selec-trak 4WD. I was dissapointed when the first time at (200 miles on the odometer) i shifted into 4WD, and the linkage jammed up, and got stuck into 4wd lo and i Heard an awfull grinding sound in the trans. Thats when i noticed that the &quot;face plate&quot; on the selec-trak was for the command trak. I took it to the dealer, explained to them the problem. they fixed the linkage. (so far it seems to be working at 2300 miles, but i only used it 3 times since) it seems really stiff though hard to get back into 2wd. I also recently noticed that the fog lamps dont work. 

Just wondering if anyone else has experianced the same problems ?
