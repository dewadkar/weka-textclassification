            Jeep continues to outdo itself each year with the new models of the Grand Cherokee, and 1998 was no exception. It is sleeker, faster, and plusher than last year�s model. 

The slightly modified body design makes the car look a little less rugged and curvier, but do not be mistaken. It still has that powerful V8 under the hood. My family has a 1995 and a 1998 Grand Cherokee Limited. The 1998 out throttles the 1995 easily. The engine sounds cleaner and is more responsive. 

Like other SUV�s, this car gets poor gas mileage, but there is no way to avoid that. The engine has needed little more than regular tune-ups and oil changes so far. It has performed excellently in both the heat of the summer and the snow of winter. The 4WD was a very valuable commodity during the snows.

The sound system is very clean and clear and the optional CD player has never given us any trouble. The seat heaters are a great luxury to have in the cold weather if you can afford them. The back seats fold down to give extra cargo space.

Overall, I�d say this is one fine SUV. It�s fast and powerful, comfortable and roomy. The only problem, it�s hard to remember to stay under the speed limit in it.
