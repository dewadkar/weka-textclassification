            Recently I read an article on the new Lincoln, where they had referred to it as the &quot;Import Fighter.&quot;  I think it may have been Lincoln that used that term originally.  Import Fighter does not do justice to this car.  I've driven every car in this market and I say with certainty that the LS spanks the GS400, Infinity Q45, and Audi A6.  This new Lincoln kicks the front-drive transaxles from under every 5-series wanabee that GM, FOMOCO, and MOPAR have put out to date.  The boys at Cadillac would be wise to follow Lincoln's lead. 

Strong power-plant, REAR-WHEEL DRIVE (Its a pusher!), and a great balance between comfort and all out driver's car.

The BMW 5-series is the vehicle that all these guys are gunning for.  The Lincoln LS is as close to the mark as it comes.  The Bavarians should stay on their toes.  This car is handsome, sporty, quick, fast (yes, there is a difference), agile, composed, and yes luxurious.  

I have only two complaints.  The cup-holder between the front seats are of poor design.  It takes two movements to open it.  Secondly, Lincoln should offer this beauty with a V-8 and the manual transmission.  

This car with a year of debugging, a V-8/manual tranny option, and a Touring model (that's German for Station Wagon) will steal the hearts of American in love with Lexus, Mercedes and yes, even BMW.  It stole mine.

This is a true driver's car.  BMW BEWARE!<br><br>
