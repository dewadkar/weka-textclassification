            I brought my C-4000 this past Christmas.I was looking to make an upgrade from the starters 2.0 megapixel camera that I currently had.No second thought on the C-4000 it had everything that I was looking for.After reading review after review on quite a few sites all but bad was said.I thought I buy one for 30 days and give it a try.

Pictures are real clean and sharp the moment I uploaded them on my PC.Uploading pictures to the PC was a breeze, fast and trouble free.Color values looked natural and not over done,of course just make sure you have the right shooting mode(s) on this baby.Zoom ratio is pretty neat even pass the Digital Zoom until about 8X ,then you will see pixel blurs.. at $450 dollars nothing I touched came this close.The camera has all controls laid out neatly on the main body also.Not many combinations buttons to press on automatic.Manual picture shooting does get a little hard though with adding or taking away value settings so if your out shooting pictures on the fast lane this may slow you down a notch or two until you get the hang of it.

LCD seems bigger than most cameras, I guess the C-4000 adds a black border around the LCD display making the LCD appear bigger than the 1.8 inches.Black and white picture shooting is a neat thing also.Video is nice but no sound that's ok for me though.If your planning on taking many pictures when you first open the box...you should really pick up an extra memory card no doubt about it.The 16mb card is kind of small if you shoot at high resolutions.

The user manual that came with the C-4000 can be hard to understand as it seems like it was printed a little fast.You get the idea that the manual speaks to you like if you already know what everything is suppose to mean.Software is good nothing out of this world but I take it.I brought a camera not the software first!

Bottom line,Starters or curious digital camera buyers might get lost with this camera finding the right settings it may not be for you.Lightweight or small camera fans may not think this is their cup of tea as well.Other than that Aim to the C-4000 it gives you a lot of punch!
