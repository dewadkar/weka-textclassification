            I bought my 1999 Chevy Lumina LTZ brade new off the lot. It was a quick purchase decision made by my husband and myself.  

Not knowing much of what is on the market I have found several features that have been an added bonus for me. The loaded Lumina LTZ has driving comfort for short and long distance.  The controls on the steering wheel are a nice added feature to keep your eyes on the road.  Leather interior is quick and easy cleaning having small children.  Driving several highway miles a day it gives good gas mileage.  The sliding sun roof is fun on sunny days and the colder days you can close the door to block any winter draft that may slip through.  The lock out option and the option to open the door from the outside only are great when you don't have someone to control the children while you are driving. It's almost like having a built in babysitter for safety purposes.

The major downfall I have is the fact that it only has ONE cup holder.  This is not only an inconvenience for myself, however it affects each and every passenger.  One concern is having no option to turn off the passenger side airbag.  In situations where you must have a child in front it is a danger to the child, even having the seat all the way back.

This vehicle would be recommended for anyone who is looking for a larger sporty car and needs the convenience of four doors.<br><br>
