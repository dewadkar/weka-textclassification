            I bought this car because it was cheap. It's a 98 LS model. With everything loaded( air, auto, ABS, CD, and a 2.4L engine!), I paid only $12K out of pocket, the rest with the GM credit and rebates. The same equipped Civic or Corolla may cost $4K or $5K more. The car is adequate to handle my daily commute needs. To get in and out of the traffic quickly can be achieved by quick acceleration and peppy handling. However, it started leaking engine oil and transmission fluid around 10K miles. It was a mess under the hood and the smell of burnt oil/fluid made me think the car was going to catch fire. The leakage was fixed under the warranty, but it left me the uncomfortable feeling of owning an unreliable car. Basically, I like the car but would like it better if the car is more reliable.<br><br>
