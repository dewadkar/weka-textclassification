            Being a technological connoisseur, my roommate decided to invest in the sony fd-83. Ignorant to the technology age and quite sure I would break it, I was very reluctant to play with his new toy. After literally a three minute overview session, I was out loading floppy discs full of shots. It was that easy! The effects and capabilities of this machine are incredible. It's portable, lightweight and the preview screen lets you know exactly how the shot will come out. The real beauty of this product is its simplicity. I can take amazing shots, eject the disc and attach them in E-mails so I can keep my family and friends updated with all of my college experiences. Not only is a marvel in terms of technology but also in communication. I can use the pictures I take to accompany projects, enhance artwork or just be goofy with my friends. The Sony fd-83 will definitely make memories.  <br><br>
