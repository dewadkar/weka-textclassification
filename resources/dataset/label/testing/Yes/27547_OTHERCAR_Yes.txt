            This is my third jeep product, my second cherokee.  I bought this in 99, it is a 96 limited grand cherokee.   I've put about 52 thousand miles on it.  Everyone has been trouble free.     

I rarely wash it, wax it.  I abuse the paint, I don't wash the salt off in the winter, and to this day, the paint is still unmared, and no rust.  As any previous jeep owner knows, the paint is probibly the best paint jobs put on a vehicle.   

So far, no rust either.  I live in ohio, and everyone knows living in ohio rust is hard to prevent due to the salt used on the roads in the winter time.   The 4x4 is simply the best.   Jeep calls it quadrodrive.   My experience with other 4x4s (mainly fords) jeep has a far better system.   I I feel very comfortable on snow and ice in the jeep.  

It has a straight 6 engine and seems to have plenty of power.  I have pulled everything from boats to campers and even a car from N. Carolina to Ohio.   

Plenty of room too, in the front, and the back seats!   I have the limited Grand Cherokee, so there are some extra options I'd like to point out!

Climet control
Duel Powered front seats
8 Speaker Sterio
heated mirrors
Onboard Computer Screen
Keyless entry
All the mirrors tent at night when a car drives uppon you!
Quadrodrive (4x4)
Headlights turn thereselves on and off on their own.
Three button Garage door opener built into the visor
powered sun/moon roof.
Extremely easy cruse control on the sterring wheel.
Radio controll buttons on the backside of the steering wheel
Computer lets you know which headlight, taillight is burnt out.
Computer also montitors all the fluids and lets you know when any are getting low!

Jeep has really thought this vehicle out!  I hightly recommend it.  Anyhown who wants a solid vehicle, doesn't want to worry about it breaking down, this is for you!

My only major complaint is the 16.7mph gas consumption.  My previouse jeep was a 95 limited cherokee, it has the 318 v8 engine, it actually preformed better with gas, I averaged about 19mph.
