            I just got back from a trip to Northern California. I rented a mirage for the trip. I love this car. Not only did it ride very smooth but I saved about $25.00 in gas on the trip. It got very good gas milage. I love this car so much I am now going to buy one. Never did I think I would choose a foreign car over an american made one,but I am. It has power steering which made my trip better and much more relaxing. The suspension was wonderful. I would recommend this car to all my friends . The cons however,well I just can't find any.This in my opinion is the best foreign car on the market.<br><br>
