            In order to completely rub out any last remnants of my sex appeal, I went out and bought the Toyota Sienna minivan. It�s the leap you never wanted to take, but if you�re like me, one day you woke up and found yourself in the demographic eerily perfect for one. Happily though, the reality of owning the Toyota Sienna was a pleasant one. They�re spacious and sturdy yet it�s not like driving an 18-wheeler. 
Also, they�re not cool enough to get stolen very often. Furthermore, I used to always cringe when I drove pass policemen, even when I was sober and doing nothing wrong. In the minivan, I�ve enjoyed the comforts of looking like a law abiding citizen. In the Toyota Sienna you experience the inverse of racial profiling. There seems to be an unwritten code amongst law enforcement officials not to pull over minivans.  (However, if you do happen to be someone fond of enjoying a cold one on the road, most Toyota Sienna�s are equipped with at least 4 cup holders. ) 

The Toyota Sienna is sort of a sportier minivan (yeah, I know � that�s what they all say) but it truly is.  It reminds me in a sense of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, only it�s a bit closer to the ground. Granted, chicks aren�t going to check you out when you�re driving a Toyota  Sienna, (if you�re a guy approaching the midlife neccessity of such reassurances,) which is sort of a shame, for were you to succeed in scoring a chick into your minivan, you could perform every ludicrous sex act ever dreamed up (even the ones that are illegal in Utah) in the spacious confines of this auto with the privacy-enhancing tinted windows.  

It drives nice, too. Sm-oooooth, although, truth be told,  I�m coming off of a stint with Jeep Wrangler badly in need of new shocks and struts.  The Sienna offers the immense benefits of the sliding side doors to get the kids in and out, even in the tightest parking space. No door to swing open, dinging yourself in the head or  the quarter panel of the car beside you.  It comes in three models, the CE, LE and XLE. We opted for the middle ground LE, and find it to have all the amenities necessary. Electric everything, great visibility, CD players (standard in all models.) It�s a pretty damn nice car, and I�d give it the highest recommendation, if not just for the reasons I�ve cited, I think you should get one, so I can feel a little less alone.  Perhaps it should come with a free motorcycle so it balances out peoples trepidation with respect to the fear people might have for what this sort of car might do to their image.
