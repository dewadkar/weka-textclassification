            I needed a HD 4X4 pick-up with an extended cab, for my family, my heavy hauling of fish for work, and the need to deliver in all weather conditions, like deep New England snow.
The Cummins diesel, and the good looks of the Dodge 2500 swayed me.
I have owned Ford, and found it &quot;Fixed Or Repaired Daily&quot;, as well as &quot;Found ON the Road Dead&quot;.
However, I may look at an F350 Super-Duty 4X4 for a second vehicle.
It is a high climb into the 4X4 Dodge, and it should have had a 6 speed, and posi, but since I bought it from the first buyer, who couldnt afford it, what could I do?
I have driven 20 and 22 foot straight-jobs in Boston, on the fish-pier, and backing into bays at freezers, so the 20 1/2 foot entire truck is small to me.
I give it a thumbs up.<br><br>
