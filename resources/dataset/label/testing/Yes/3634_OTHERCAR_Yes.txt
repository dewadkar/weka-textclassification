            This is my second Pontiac Grand Prix GTP. I put 56,000 miles on my 1997 and just over 11,000 on my 1999. I have never owned an automobile where I have enjoyed every mile I've driven it. It's acceleration is breathtaking, especially when the supercharger winds up. From a rolling start, I can hear front wheel &quot;squeal&quot; for more than 300 yards. On a recent trip from Cincinnati, Ohio to Austin, Texas and back, I averaged 31.7 miles per gallon at 74 mph with the cruise and A/C on. This also included stops every hour or so and travelling through the foothills. The &quot;heads-up&quot; display is exactly where it needs to be and wonderful for keeping my speed within reasonable limits.

The paint is super-glossy no matter how dirty it gets. Maintenance is almost non-existant, using less than a quart of Mobil-1 synthetic oil between changes. And the on-board computer tracks remaining oil life so I can plan the change weeks in advance.

The CD/Radio is awesome. I can play the 1812 Overture with digital cannons and vibrate the outside mirrors at 75 mph. Only once have I hit a bump strong enough to make the CD skip. I know when the volume is up enough when my pants leg vibrates on my leg. The leather heated seat fits like a glove although the lack of passenger seat heater has my lady miffed.

Recently I bought two 10 ft. lengths of PVC pipe at the hardware store and with the rear seat pass-through door open, put both through the trunk and closed the lid. People were staring for quite some time, wondering where the pipe went.

My 1997 GTP never went to the shop for corrections or repairs so I doubt if my 1999 will see a mechanic either. The only two things Pontiac overlooked are the passenger seat heater and a locking gas cap or filler door.

NOTE: I bought the first Ford Pinto in South Carolina in 1970. Its 4 cylinder 1600 cc engine wouldn't get 30 miles per gallon downhill with the key off. Needless to say, I shopped for a different car to replace my 1997 Pontiac GTP but nothing came close. Performance and economy in one package. Awesome! I truly love every mile I drive it.<br><br>
