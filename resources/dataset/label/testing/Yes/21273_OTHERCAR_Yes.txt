            I'm a person who strictly buys American cars, but I must admit I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the Toyota Camry. 

A co-worker of mine has a 1992 Toyota Camry LE sedan that he uses regularly since his heavily used 1983 Chevrolet Caprice Classic's transmission gave up the ghost after 155,000 miles about 3 months ago. Apparently, his Camry also sees a lot of heavy use since it too has racked up an amazing 145,000 miles. I was quite impressed, for this high-mileage car seem to be holding up extremely well. What's even more impressive is that the car can withstand the kind of abuse he gives it. By the time he was finished with the Caprice it looked like your average 6-year old Manhattan taxicab. His Camry also displays the same exterior wear and tear caused by heavy city driving. However, the car is holding up very well mechanically. Most cars are held together with baling wire and &quot;duck&quot; tape by the time they see that kind of mileage and abuse - if they can even last that long. His Camry still gives a smooth ride and seemed to be tight and rattle free despite its numerous deep scratches and dents. 

The 1992 Camry looks fresh and contemporary even after eight years. It's aerodynamic styling is a quantum leap over the rather boxy look of the 1991 and previous models. My co-worker's car has a black enamel finish with a grey and black cloth interior. It has the 2.2 litre transverse four-cylinder engine mated to a 4-speed automatic with overdrive. The four isn't much of a powerhouse, but it does seem to adequately propel the car. Gas mileage is a respectable 26 MPG. I personally would go for the V-6 for a little more &quot;oomph!&quot; 

The dashboard in would be at home in a 2000 model car. The quality of materials and fit and finish are of the level one expects in a more expensive car. The instrumentation is complete and very functional. My only complaint is that its flat-black finish looks too utilitarian. It wouldn't hurt for Toyota to ration out a few more chrome and fake wood accents. I do like the lighted gearshift selector display on the instrument panel. It gives the Camry a little touch of Lexus. The factory stereo still gave crisp and clear sound. The A/C was effective.

The trunk provides plenty of room for our equipment and is easy to access with a low liftover. A crew of five sits comfortably even on long trips, though the back can be a little cramped, especially if tall passengers are seated up front and the seats are placed far back. 

My co-worker has told me that he needed to replace the driver's side window motor and the transmission at a rather steep cost of $2000 and some change. I don't know if Toyota can be faulted for this or if this is simply due to wear and tear. 

A bad thing about the Camry is that it seems everybody has one and it's not the car to have if you seek a sense of individuality. Some people also say that Camry quality has slipped lately. I don't know if this is really true. Perhaps many people simply expect more from the car just because it's a Camry and hold it to a higher standard. 

Anyway you look at it, the Camry is pretty much a good choice if you're looking for solid no-nonsense practical transportation.
