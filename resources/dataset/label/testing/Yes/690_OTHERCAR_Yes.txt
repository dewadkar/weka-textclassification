            I had this camera for nearly two years and took over ten thousand photographs with it. It did everything I wanted it to, and greatly improved my photographic ability.

However, there came a point when I had pushed its technology to the limit, and in order to become a better photographer, I had to upgrade to a camera that had a more complete manual mode. 

This camera takes excellent photographs in its automatic settings. You don't need to know anything at all about photography or how to operate a camera, and you will still take excellent photographs.

It is still out there on the market for very good prices - I've seen it as low as $300, though I think the average is closer to $500. I've been told that it has leveled out now and is unlikely to drop any lower in the next few years, as it still fills a necessary place on the digital camera market. 

There is honestly nothing wrong with this camera - it is, in fact, much better than most of them out there, with features such as the swivelling lens and the wonderful macro mode. It may be slightly limiting to photographers who want a complete manual mode, but it is excellent for the average user who just wants to take a good photo.
