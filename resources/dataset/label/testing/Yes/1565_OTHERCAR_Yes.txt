            I remember (from my younger, single days) wondering why anyone would ever drive a minivan.  I swore that I would never be caught driving something so &quot;family-ish&quot;.  A few years later, my father-in-law bought a Caravan Sport, and after borrowing for a couple of trips, I was hooked.  Fortunately, soon after the birth of my first child, he bought a new one, and I was able to buy his 1995 model.  <br>Although it currently has over 100,000 miles, it has not had any major problems.  It still runs like a dream, and on long trips, it's comfort cannot be beat!  We are able to travel with all the equipment a new baby requires, and still have plenty of room.  Even my husband, a confirmed truck lover, likes the van.  The only trouble I have had with it is that the paint is peeling off of a spot on the hood (which I have found to be a common problem with Chrysler products).<br><br>Since falling in love with this van, I have been spreading the word, and now my parents also own one.  If you have a family or just like to have a great ride with lots of elbow space, this is the vehicle for you!<br><br><br>
