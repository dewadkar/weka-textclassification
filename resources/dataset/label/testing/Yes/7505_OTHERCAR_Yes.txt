            When My daughter (now 2) turned 8 mths old I decided it was time to get rid of my 2-door 1989 Pontiac Grand-AM and into a larger, newer, safer, 4-door vehicle, so I bought a 1996 Dodge Stratus.  Ever since I bought it, it has been a headache!  2 wks after I brought it home the brakes were metal-to-metal and had to be replaced.  I was then involved in an accident where I rear-ended a vehicle at 25-30MPH and the air bags did not deploy.  After investigation, they concluded that I didn't hit the sensors &quot;right&quot;.  Well, my head sure hit the steering wheel &quot;right&quot;!
Then, every time I would take a highway trip, the oil filter would come loose and start leaking oil. (At least that's what I was told) It turns out the engine was leaking oil from the head gasket. (Known problem in Dodge Stratus) Since then I have struggled to keep the oil level high until I could save up enough money to get them replaced.  In the mean time, I threw a rod and now have internal engine damage.  I have to buy a new engine.  The car has been sitting in the garage - undrivable - for 3mths. During this time I have had no transportation and have to rely on family and friends to get me around.  I cannot afford a $1,500 engine right now, and I'm not sure I ever will be able to afford it and still pay the car payment on time.  I have contacted Chrysler numerous times about this, because I am not the only Stratus owner to have this problem.  I have been stonewalled everytime and told that Chrysler would offer no financial assistance.  Chrysler is obviously aware of the problem, yet refuses to recall them.  It isn't fair to consumers to be sold faulty card when they know about the problem, but just ignore it and hope it will go away!
If you want a cheaply made car, and no customer service or help with any kind of problem, buy this car.  If not, save yourself the headache!<br><br>
