            My mom bought a 1998 Passport when they came out because they were just so beautiful and they had redesigned them for 98 and it was time for her to trade. She absolutely loves it, as do I. It has everything anyone could ask for and has so much power that it gets away from you sometimes. It drives beautifully....I love to drive it. It goes up hills like magic with the 205hp 3.2 liter V6. Ours has the optional wheels on it which are gorgeous and we got the bright silver metallic paint. Ours also has the rear mounted spare which is nice for looks and for safety purposes (in case of a rear end collision) It has ABS and airbags and every other safety feature you can imagine and even a little man that doesnt go out till you are buckled up. Other than recalls ( there have only been 3)and one other thing I will tell you about in a second, it hasnt been to the shop. Well the one problem we did have....the wheels had to be replaced twice. It was covered under warranty and all but it was annoying. The alloy kept coming off of them for some reason. The dealer said that ours and one other passport was doing that. So he researched and called Honda and told them it was a big problem and so far (knock on wood) they have been fine since the last replacement. But it drives like a dream, has every feature you would ever want, and everyone is always complimenting how beautiful it is. We live in the boonies in Pennsylvania where there are hard winters and 4 wheel drive is just a touch of a button away and you can engage it at speeds up to 60. If you accidentally hit it though over 60 it just wont engage to keep from damaging anything. I would recommend this vehicle to everyone especially if you want something that is beautiful, yet will get you where you need to go. This car would be great for someone who was looking to go from a sports car to an SUV too because it has the power and handling of a sports car. My mom and I both love her passport.....I could write so much more on how great it is.
