            Well, let me start out by telling you that I traded in a 1995 Mustang 2-door to get a White 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 Sport package. This came with automatic, air, tilt, cruise, and a sunroof...and 4WD.<br>I would not even consider going back to a car again. The power and reliability that this vehicle has shown me are unmatched. If you are reading this in the Wilmington, NC area, I would however recommend that you NOT buy your truck at Neuwirth Motors. Their service department, for something as simple as an oil change, is horrible.<br><br>Anyway, the truck is smooth, sleek, and flawless in its performance. It is unmatched on the beach for pulling power and just for looks. People look at you while you are driving a big, beautiful Dodge.<br><br>I got an extended cab, and find that there is twice as much room as I had in my mustang. It easily fits a car seat, and to adults very comfortably. It has even fit a car seat, child a four adults comfortably.<br><br>The only drawbacks are the V* Magnum engine is not the best on gas mileage. You are probably looking at 10-15 mpg in the city..less if you are on the beach a lot. Everything else about the truck is great!!!!<br><br><br>
