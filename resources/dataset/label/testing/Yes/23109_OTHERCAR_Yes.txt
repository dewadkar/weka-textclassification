            Nine monthago I bought this polaroid digital camera to take pictures to send relatives over the internet. Many were impressed of the quality. It is easy to use and takes nice pictures for auctions as well. The only downfall is the batterries wear down quickly so I would reccommend getting rechargable ones. One small warning do not attempt to plug it in if you already have the photomax software running. It zaps your camera and now I will be looking to replace mine. I liked this one so well I will either buy another one or the 700 model.You can't beat the price for this quality unless you want to spend hundreds more.<br><br>
