            My Integra is just as great as I hoped it to be. I've never had any problems that are out of the ordinary. The only things I've had done to the car is the routine oil changes and check-ups, and I've also added some after-market wheels along with a muffler and coil-over springs. The car is great! Awesome gas mileage is a must for me because of my daily transit over a mountain, and the car usually gets 350miles a tank, (12 gallon tank) and when driving without having to commute I've been able to get 400  mileage. The car is great not only for its quality, but also has many after-market performance parts so people out there that want to put your own spin on your car, with the Integra you've got many choices. The only problem I've encountered is that the backseat isn't that comfortable for people taller than 5'8 or 5'9. If they are taller, than they'll have to be bent over like a hunch back. The car only seats 4, but considering the size of the car I don't think you could expect to fit any more people in it! When it comes to the engine, the LS version I have comes with a 1.8L pushing around 140hp. Considering the size of the motor, I'm impressed with its get up and go, and mine doesn't even have Vtech which was a option on the 94' models. As for long trips the car is great. Just set the cruise, sit back, and enjoy the ride. The seats are comfortable and have lumbar support for the driver. In strenuous driving situations the seats hold you right in place. You might not think that you could get much into the car, but if needed the back seats fold down for more cargo space. I've only had to fold my seats down twice due to transporting my sister's wedding gifts (this was so they wouldn't get crushed) and whenever I've had to deliever some large packages to a friend who ordered wheels. The car also comes with a factory installed sunroof for your driving pleasure which comes in handy during those hot summer days. It also has 2 cupholders, but I wouldn't try to get anything larger than a medium drink at any drive-thru. Overall, I absolutely LOVE my car!
