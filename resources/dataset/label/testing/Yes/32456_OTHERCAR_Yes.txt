            I bought this vehicle for my wife when it was 5 years old.  It had 29,000 miles at the time.  We experienced no trouble until 60,000 miles when, shockingly, the transmission failed.  $3500.00 later we are still not sure it won't go out again in the near future.  This is fairly common we have found, by searching on the internet.  This car was babied by  my wife and serviced regularly.  We replaced the timing belt as well, but that was just scheduled maintenance.  It seems to go through tires rapidly as well.  My wife believes the transmission was  sabotaged by the dealer who worked on the timing belt; I am not sure, but it could have happened.  To sum up, it's a great car but not for the person who can't afford to fix one.  It drives very well and is fast and fun.  Definitely not for a kid.<br><br>
