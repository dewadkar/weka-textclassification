            I just bought my 92 Stealth ES in September of 2000.  That's right it is 8 years old(nine by the build date) and has 136000 miles.  One thing the Japanese know how to do is make dependable cars.  This car feels just like i drove it off the lot even after that many miles.  For those of you interested it is made by Mitsubishi in Japan, not Dodge in America.

The Mitsubishi made 3000GT/Stealth have several models to choose from.  The base mod Stealth housing a 3.0 V6 SOHC compared to the base model 3000GT having a 3.0 V6 Dohc(until 97 when it turned up as a SOHC to get more sales).  The Stealth ES has 3.0 V6 Dohc and the 3000gt SL has 3.0 V6 DOHC.  The normal Stealth RT has a 3.0 V6 DOHC (same as ES and SL) while the Stealth RT T/T has a 3.0 V6 DOHC Twin Turbo(T/T) with AWD/AWS, and the 3000GT VR4 has the same setup.  

Notice above I said AWD/AWS.  Yes, I meant all wheel steering, and all wheel drive.  How many sports cars can you think of that have AWD let alone AWS.  I don't know of any other car that does.  The AWS is supposed to allow the driver to take corners better.  It is nearly impossible for a twin turbo driver to get wheel spin with AWD even with the 94 engine rated at 320HP.

For most sports cars a small amount of leg room is expected, but I am more than enthusiastic about the leg room in my Stealth.  I am 6'3&quot; and can stretch my long legs out completely.  On the highway I slide them under the gas and brakes and set the cruise and go.  The AC works the best I have ever felt, and the heater works great too.  The gauges were put in the center to be different and to give the driver a different and more spacious view of the gauges that are ALWAYS being looked at.  Just to remind you those would be RPM and Speedometer.  On occasion I do find myself looking at the center gauges housed in a humped dash cover.  If you haven't seen the inside of the 3000GT/Stealth I do recommend.  It looks just as good as the outside.

The first thing I did when I test drove my car was adjust all the mirrors and took off.  I have not had a problem seeing out of the rear hatch nor the side mirrors even with winter coming and the windows fogging.

For people concerned with sound that didn't want to replace any stereo parts Mitsubishi made cars with a system configured by Infinity to satisfy their needs.

Moving onto more of the best of the best packages for the 3000GT/Stealth twin turbo models.  These cars came with a vast array of standard features.  These range from exotic ideas of rpm controlled exhaust gates that control engine back pressure at low rpm.  This allows the twin turbos to spool up better.  The cars also come with electronic controlled suspension ECS with a few settings.  Sport mode sets the car in an extremely stiff mode.  One of the other modes actually changes the suspension stiffness depending on what you and the car are doing.  Say if you have the brakes on the suspension in the front tightens to not allow the car to roll forward as normal cars do.  The same would happen under acceleration the suspension would tighten in the rear instead of the front.  This would not let the car roll back under acceleration.  The 3000GT SL model had this feature too I believe.  One of the last features I can remember is the Active Aero.  The spoilers on the car are controlled by the driver by a switch inside.

For what my opinion is worth it is a great car whichever model you choose.  Although the naturally aspirated DOHC 222HP engine in the 3000GT (base and SL) and Stealth (ES and RT) are the most dependable.  Keep in mind if you decide to purchase one of these cars the repairs are expensive.  An example would be the timing belt alone is 200 dollars on average.  That does not include labor; it might be helpful to learn how to do it yourself.

The best thing I could have done after getting my Stealth ES was to join www.3si.org.  This site is full of 3000Gt and Stealth owners that are extremely willing to give helpful information.  There is even a portion of the site designed to allow parts buying and selling.  Like I said it's been a great help in gaining information.

I do recommend getting a 3000GT or Stealth.  They are dependable, and are pretty rare to see driving around.<br><br>
