            I'm sort of embarrassed to say it, but my first vehicle was a Dodge Caravan. Now you're probably wondering why a sixteen year old kid is driving around in a minivan, a soccer-mom-mobile for cryin' out loud. Well you see my grandparents had this 93 Dodge Caravan LE, and they decided that after 135k miles they needed another one. You see, Caravans and Voyagers have this slight little problem - their transmissions are complete junk! I can almost guarantee you every old-style Chrysler minivan you see on the road today had its tranny replaced sometime or other. This particular van that my grandparents owned was currently on its 2nd tranny, and closin' in for the third.

My grandparents, in a generous gesture, offered to sell the minivan to my parents for $1000. The van's trade-in was a little over $3k, so this was a good deal. So I got the minivan as my vehicle when I made my license.

Now I'm your average teenaged American male, and as such I <b>abused</b> that poor van. The van had a 3.3L V6. It was way-underpowered (well, for me anyways), and I'd like to say 0-60 in 12 seconds. None-the-less one day I pinned the speedometer at 100. This could not have been good for the engine or the tranny, but 16 year-old kids don't think about that. The van must have taken a minute to go from 90-100. I loved to peel out in the van. It was engineered to deliver torque, not horsepower, and it showed. It peeled out easy but couldn't pull after that.

The van had an Infinity tape system which was ok. It have 2 woofers and 4 other speakers I think. I abused that too. I would turn it up so loud the speakers would distort. I had a portable CD player and a car adapter kit and I would turn the bass boost all the way up and distort the speakers. The outside of the van would buzz. It was pretty funny.

I once got pulled over in the van. I was doing 70 in a 25 zone. Let me say first the speed limit should be 40, not 25 on this city road (everyone does 45). 2nd it was 2 o'clock in the morning. Who knew the cops were out that late? Well, the cop must have thought I was drinking or something because he was shocked to see fully sober me in a freakin' minivan. I think he was laughing at me but he gave me a verbal warning so I really don't care.

So I suffered with this van for around three months. All my friends ridiculed me for having a minivan. Oh, did I mention I was paying $2200 a year in insurance and getting around 17mpg? You can imagine my glee when my parents announced they were getting a new car. I jumped for joy as my parents went out and purchased a Lexus ES300, trading the minivan in for it. You see, this left me with the jet-black '92 Pontiac Bonneville that was my dad's old car. The Pontiac weighs a couple hundred lbs less and has a 3.8L V6. It's quite a bit faster. I've spanked my share of ricer Civics and other junk in it. Oh yes did I mention it has, at last count, an 800 watt sound system?

So the moral of this review is. Buy a minivan if you've got a lot of kids or stuff to haul around. Don't buy one for your teenager.

One more thing. Here's a <b>very</b> interesting Caravan. Now this is what I should have done to my van!         http://pages.cthome.net/gus/mini.html <br><br>
