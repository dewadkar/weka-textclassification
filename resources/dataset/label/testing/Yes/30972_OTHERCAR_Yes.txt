            I bought this car off of the lot my husband works for 11 months ago.  When I bought "Yoshi" he had 107,000 miles and a very stiff clutch (Since remedied! For all you gear-heads out there, never put a Rodeo clutch cable in these cars, it doesn't work!)  but what impressed me most was the person who had traded him in had all of his service records, even his Maroni (New Car) sticker was in the packet.  What further impressed me was she returned to the lot two days later after I had already taken the car home and bonded with him and she wanted him back!  The only repairs my husband and I have made is replacing torn CV boots and replaced his tires.  Yoshi gets an oil change every 3000 miles whether he needs it or not and has survived 100+ mile commutes every weekday with no complaints.  I am so pi**ed off that Isuzu stopped importing this car.  Since our purchase Yosh has been given a CD player to replace his standard cassette.  I have never seen a Japanese car with mat clips!?!  Little things to hold the floormats in place?!?  This car has factory air, power mirrors, driving lights,need I say more?  If you're looking for an economical, insurance affordable car, this is it!  Thanks...Shauna Moore.
