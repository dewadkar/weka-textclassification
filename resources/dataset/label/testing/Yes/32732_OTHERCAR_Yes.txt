                   <b>I</b>n 1998 the SS tag was applied to a Camaro for the third year straight. Early versions of this modified Z28 was developed by tuning company SLP (street legal performance) but Chevrolet begin building them in 1998.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

        The <b>1998 Camaro SS</b> ('SS' stands for 'super sport')is very well balanced and very fast; tight handling and braking that exceeds almost anything in this price range, approx $27,000 fully loaded back in 1998. Thanks to the new (at the time) Ls1 347 CI V8 for this year, it can reach 0-60 in only 5.2 seconds (according to specs; some people have got these cars to run even faster)! The Camaro SS will impress even the most dedicated muscle car enthusiasts. Even at speeds as high as 100 MPH, the Camaro's 12" ABS enhanced brakes will slow this car very fast, much faster than my experience with the 3rd generation Mustangs/Camaro's.
      
<b>F</b>ourth Generation Camaro's still retain the front engine, rear drive format, with an unequal length wishbone <b>suspension</b> up front and a live axle at the rear. coupes and convertibles are also offered with the SS package, which include stiffer shock springs and larger anti roll bars for the front a rear.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

      The SS's <b>interior</b> screams "performance" thanks to its large analog gauges, supportive bucket seats, and perfect placement of pedals and shifter. The leather is a tad on the cheap side, but it looks great, and feels good once you have settled yourself in. Amenities are plenty, and ergonomics are darn near perfect for a human, and when I say "human" I think we all know in some cars those ergonomics are made for some unknown creature. My only gripe really with the interior of this car is the over-use of cheap plastic materials. I would have liked to see more quality control, especially since this is a 1998 model, not 1988.

<i>Pricing:</i> 

       The <b>price</b> is right for this car. 'Brand new' these cars went for $27,000, but now, thanks to relatively bad American resale value, you can buy a 1998 Camaro SS for around $18,000, or even less. Tester ran $19,000 with almost all options. This means the average Joe, or Jane can afford one of these babies. 


<i>Conclusion:</i>

If you are in the market for a used muscle car, don't mind the girth of a large coupe, than the Camaro SS offers amazing bang for your buck, and is sure to be a future classic.
