            I bought this vehicle for three reasons.  First, I needed a car to get me to and from work and school everyday.  Second, I wanted a car that allowed me to transport business clients and friends without feeling embarrassed about its size and/or functionality.  Finally, I wanted a good degree of comfort and space within a vehicle that gave me a sporty feel.  I'm proud to say that the '95 Sebring accomplished all those things.

I have been pleasantly surprised with the car's efficient gas mileage.  Also, the automatic transmission in my vehicle has never given me any problems whatsoever (I am at 75,000 miles already).  There is a noise problem when you shift though.  It makes a loud grinding sound that Chrysler representatives have told me is to be expected with all of their Sebrings.  The brakes work very well, especially the anti-locking mechanisms.  In fact, the brakes have stopped me before slamming into someone else a few times already.  The paneling on the lower parts of the vehicle also presents a little bit of an aesthetic problem for the most detail-oriented purchaser.  It happens a bit too often that I notice an edge of the panel sticking out, almost falling off or just not applied perfectly straight...it can get annoying.

The driving experience in the Sebring is pretty exciting for a vehicle of its type.  The V-6 engine pulls you out of corners nicely and gives you great pickup for getting on the highway.  The steering feels a bit loose, but I kind of expected it from a larger car like this one.  Also, cruise control definitely comes in handy for long hauls.  The ride itself is also smooth...the shocks seem to work quite well.

I feel that persons looking for functionality with a little bit of sportiness should certainly consider this vehicle.  I have enjoyed it thus far and I hope everyone else will too.<br><br>
