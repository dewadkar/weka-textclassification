            I've been keeping track of the opinions posted around this car. Everyone's done a great job of posting the stats, and giving a good overview of nearly all aspects of this car, including the driving....but I wanted to focus on the area in which this car excels...."<b>having the living daylights beaten out of it</b>". 

First, I'll deal with the <i>"things to consider"</i> list presented by Epinions when writing reviews (since this is my first post):

<b>1) Did it live up to your expectations?</b>
*cleans up the puddle of drool*  It did when I bought it, It did when I crossed through the break-in period, and it's doing it 11,450 miles later.

<b>2) Who should buy or avoid this product?</b>
People who should NOT buy:
+ anyone who will be driving primarily on poorly maintained roads, dirt roads, consistently wet roads, or in areas with a lot of snow

+ anyone looking to carry more than a single passenger

+ anyone looking to carry heavy loads, or bulky items

+ anyone looking to carry a young child as a passenger

+ anyone whose weight, with passenger, exceeds approx 430lbs (exact figure published in owners manual)

+ anyone who doesn't anticipate driving with the top down very much. There are plenty of good hardtops which would be better suited.

+ anyone who isn't comfortable handling a manual transmission

+ anyone who loves to have tons of torque, such that it doesn't matter what rpm they change gears at

People who SHOULD buy:
+ anyone interested in a high performance car with sharp handling

+ anyone willing to drive the car at high rpm to extract the best performance


<b>3) Why did you buy this car?</b>
I live in the Bay Area, a place with some interesting roads (excluding the choked freeways) and great weather. I'd always wanted to try a convertible, and I wanted something which could stick to the road like a.....like a big sticky thing.

And now....the <b>DRIVING</b>.  As tacky as it seems, the big, red START button really kicks off the experience for me. I put the top down, roll out of the garage, don the sunglasses and head off.

For the first 10 minutes or so, I don't like to exceed about 4500 rpm. The owners manual basically says you shouldn't push the car too hard while the engine is cold..."cold" meaning less than 3 temp bars on the gauge.

The car is perfectly civilized and doesn't handle like a brick at low rpm as some people have implied on the discussion boards.

Once the engine temp is right, though.....oh baby. :) I like to take Skyline Blvd, a long, windy road with towering trees on either side. When there's moisture in the air, you can see individual beams of light pushing through the trees. You feel the air becoming cooler and fresher as you climb higher and further away from the rest of the world. Note: this is during the weekdays around 2pm...if you attempt this on the weekend, the whole world seems to have the same idea and will be driving in a convoy at 28 mph in front of you.

I like to take in the atmosphere a little and enjoy the sound of the engine before really pushing the car, where your mind becomes more focused on surviving the next corner, rather than watching the scenery. At these speeds, and in this state of mind, you can see, smell and otherwise sense so many things that you'd miss if you were driving in anything other than a convertible.

Ok...we've been cruising for about 5 mins, the engine's warm...the driver's warm...<b>let's rock</b>. We're probably doing around 40-45 mph in 3rd, or maybe 4th....with nobody else in sight, we drop into 2nd. The engine pipes up to around 6000 rpm.

Here, the engine takes on an entirely different personality. It's not just louder, the tone is completely changed. That's VTEC for you. The engine has changed its timing from quiet and fuel efficient to noisy and gas guzzling....fantastic.

You're pushed back into your seat, the smile edging across your face. Push the gas a little more through 7500 rpm, you can't hold back the giggle...the world is starting to whiz by considerably faster....hit the redline, you're doing 59mph, it's time for 3rd gear, good for up to 89mph.

Word to the wise....if you're driving around the hills, you're going to be spending all your time in 2nd and 3rd, that's where all the power is for the speed range you'll be using.

Another note, don't expect great acceleration going up long hills. The car's torque is low enough such that it's affected by things like the grade of the road. Anyway, back to it...

Great, we're doing about 80mph, here comes a corner that's posted as being 25mph. You hit the brakes....downshift to second, leaving you at 6000rpm, you keep braking....your eye tells you 40mph should be just fine for this corner.  The steering is absolutely dead on as you cross the apex, still at 5-6Krpm, you hit the gas again....as you straighten out, you hit the redline, bang into 3rd, and by the time you look down, you're at 65-70mph again...the corner just a fading memory.

The shifting, by the way, is an absolute pleasure. When you get it right, you'll find yourself thinking about it when you're not even driving the car :)

Repeat this process for 3 hours.  Make sure you allow time to visit the hospital to see if they can remove the smile from your face.

Quick note, unless you've been driving new Ferrari's recently, you'll find the S2k will have more grip than you when it comes to cornering. It took many, many trips for me to realize just how quickly the car can corner, as long as the road is <i>smooth and dry</i>. Both of these factors are critical.  I've taken corners where I could've gone 10-15mph faster, but when I've hit a bump or a rut, the car drifted a foot or two. Had I been going faster, it may have been less pleasant.  In short, KNOW the roads you're driving, or allow for it by not driving at the car s limits.

And lastly, to best enjoy the handling of the car...go by yourself. The car handles quite differently with a passenger, even if he/she only weighs 170lbs. Keep the trunk load to a minimum, too.

In writing this article, I was hoping to capture the greatest strengths of this car, its handling and its power. It's not a street racer. To achieve the 5.2-5.5 0-60 times posted in the mags, you need to dump your clutch at 5500rpm. That's not what this car is for. Try to ignore all the articles saying you should buy a big, heavy v8 to get a better experience. That's for a different type of driving.
