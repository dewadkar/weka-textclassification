            I had been looking for a good, dependable car for some time.  I was told by several people that Escorts were excellent cars.  In fact, I never heard a bad things about them.  So, I recently bought a 1995 Ford Escort.  4 doors, hatchback, automatic.  I was also told by my mechanic that Escorts are very inexpensive to repair and are normally very good cars.

I bought the car a few days before planning on a trip from NY to OH.  Well, the trip to Ohio was the big test, and this car passed with flying colors!

For starters, this car is loaded and has everything - including A/C, which was a very nice feature for my long trip in the middle of summer!  In 2 days, I drove over 15 hours in my Escort.  The seats were very roomy and comfortable.  The hatchback trunk held all my stuff with plenty of room to spare.  I've never seen a trunk with so much room!  Held all of my luggage with no problem whatsoever. The car would easily fit a family of four.  Two adults easily fit in the front seats and two adults would even fit in the back seat.   The back seats also fold down so you can fit longer things in the trunk of the car.  

The car has great pick up.  You step on the gas and you GO!  This is especially very good for getting on the highways.  

This car is also very fuel-efficient.  A 450-mile trip (one way) cost about $25 to get there.  That was mostly without A/C which would cost a little more to get there, but it's still great mileage.  

The car has dual airbags and automatic seatbelts - both which lowered my car insurance rates, not to mention just great features.  There are power locks, power windows, AM/FM radio and cassette.  The A/C takes less than a minute to get cold - it works great!  I usually have to turn it off (or lower it) right after a few minutes because it gets TOO cold!  

When I bought this car I got a 24,000/2 year warranty, and free oil changes and inspections for 2 years.  This is my third FORD car and so far my favorite yet!  

I consider this a very good, dependable car.  I plan on having it for quite a while!<br><br>
