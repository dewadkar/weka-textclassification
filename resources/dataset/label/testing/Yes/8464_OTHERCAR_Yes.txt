                    I have been using the Olympus 3000 Super Zoom 35mm camera for over five years and have always been happy with the Olympus line of products.  I bought a Fuji MX-1200 digital camera about two years and have been very surprised how good the quality is for the $$$.  The 1.3 megapixel resolution has always left me craving for more.  When I saw the Olympus 3030 at $497, making room for the 3040's to come into stock, I couldn't resist.  I am very happy with the purchase.  The detail, sharpness, and brightness of the Olympus pics reminds me of the quality I've bought into.  Even at the same resolutions, the 3030 has a very clear edge on the Fuji.  I've heard a lot of griping about the difficulty in navigating the menus, but I would have to disagree.  Any feature I want to access is only a step or two away.  The menu system is set up in a very logical way.

       The only complaints I have about the 3030 is the lack of a "true" macro mode and the detachable and easily lost lens cap.  I still have mine, but I'm sure it's inevitably going to be misplaced.  I've seen a lens cap made of rubber that slips over the whole lens apparatus, and then you simply open the "swing door" when it's time to take pics.  I'll definitely be looking into one of these.

       The bottom line is that you can't go wrong with the 3030.  It's a great camera, especially at the price that I purchased it at.  I was surprised with the quality of the video hookup to a television as well.  Sharp with excellent color.  This camera has it all!
