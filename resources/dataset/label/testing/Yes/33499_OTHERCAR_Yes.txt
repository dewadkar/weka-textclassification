            Imprezza. WOW. AWD, 5 spd, reliability, fun to drive, and inexpensive. Even the base model Imprezza L comes standard with AWD and a i-4 pumping out 142 horsepowere and 149 ft-lbs of torque, enough to make the light weight(around 2800 lbs) 2 door coupe pretty zippy. Still not enough, step up to the 2.5 RS and power jumps to 165 horsepowere and 169 ft-lbs of torque.

The AWD is what really sets this car ahead of the pack. Due to the this exceptional layout, the Imprezza will be just as at home in British Columbia as it will be in Southern Florida. AWD will also create awe-inspiring launches and a great handling car.

A zippy pocket rocket know for exceptional reliality. Starting in the mid 15's, this car is a steal!<br><br>
