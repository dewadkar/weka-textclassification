            The new redesigned Galant is so different than the model it replaces that they should have given it a different name.  To start off, I would have to say that the new Galant is one of the best looking cars in its segment.  The Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and the Ford Taurus all look quite bland next to the Galant.  I have owned previous family sized four doors and none of them have received the comments like this car.  I have a lot of people asking me if it is a BMW while the rest just don't have any idea what kind of car it is.  The interior is just as good looking as the exterior.  Good looking supportive seats, a woodgrain interior, and an unclutered dash.  I opted for the the 3.0 Liter 195 HP V6.  Although the 4 cylinder is more powerful than the model it replaces, it just did not have enough punch.  The 6 cylinder is quite adequate.  One area that I feel the car is lacking is in its handling.  If you are an adult in the 30's and 40's(the major market segment that drives this car), and you are just using this car to drive the kids to soccer practice or go to work, you will not find anything to complain about.  I was previously driving a Honda Prelude, which was once rated by Car and Driver as the best handling car under $30,000.  So I am used to outstanding handling and being able to really push my car to the limits.  The car has more than ample leg, hip, and headroom.  I have a good number of friends with heights in excess of 6'6&quot; and they all fit semi-comfortably in the front or backseat.  The trunk is probably on par with other cars in this class.  If you are looking for a family-sized 4 door at an affordable price, give the 3 diamonds a chance and take a look at the Galant.<br><br>
