            I bought a 1997 Ford Escort from a Ford Dealer last year.  I bought the car when it had 28000 miles on it.  A year and a half later, it has 59000 miles on it.  I haven't ever had to take this car to the shop, outside of routine maintenance.  I drove delivery in this car and it has been great.  Unfortunately I bought the BASE model.  I don't even have a tape player, but I do have A/C.  This car is very roomy.  I love the trunk and the back seat.  and if something is too long for the trunk, the seats go down.  My Escort has plenty of power for getting on the freeway, and passing people.  And, I can get 375 - 400 miles on a tank of gas.  I love the Economy.  This car is not a Lexus, but it's comfortable and drives well.  I think this is a great family car.  Very inexpensive, low low maintenance (I change my oil about every 5,000 miles).  Would I buy another?  I almost did.  I went to a Ford dealer and was just checking things out and I almost bought a 1999 Escort ZX2.<br><br>
