            Now how fair does this scenario sound?

My sister got a brand new car, we're talking 25 miles on it, when she was 4 months away from her 16th birthday.  It was a <b>1993 Dodge Shadow</b>, aqua colored.  Cool, things look good for me when I turn 16, new car.  I am 2 years behind my sister in age, so at  the time I was turning 16 and ready for my new car, she was 18 and had graduated.  So what happened?  Mom and Dad decide they've had enough of her complaining about her Shadow and give it to <i>me</i> so they can help her buy a another <i><b>new</i></b> car.

So there I was, with the unloved, under-appreciated Dodge Shadow.

I was mad, angry, upset....it's to be expected.  But eventually I got over my rage about not getting a new car and began my torture of the poor Shadow.  I will say though, this car can handle just about anything.

Yes, I admit, I did not take good care of her, after all the care she took of me.  I did enjoy the good gas mileage I got with this car.  I could ask Dad for gas money and not really need it, but he never noticed.  The car was an automatic, and really for a car of its size was quite roomy.  I once had 8 people in that little Shadow, and it was a 2 door model.  (I do not recommend you try that at home though, it wasn't that comfortable.)  It had fairly nice trunk space too.

I ragged on this car; I drove it like any 16 year old guy who hated his car would drive it.  I guess secretly I was hoping it would die and they would have no choice but to buy me something else.  All my bad driving did for the car was add many rattles and noises that were once not there.  At some point the liner on the ceiling started falling down, but a little glue fixed that up.  We never once had any engine problems out of the Shadow.  Dad made sure the oil was changed regularly and she was never once in the shop.  The radio worked pretty good but it did not have the greatest sound system in it.  I eventually put in my own CD player, but that thing died after a while, yet the Shadow drove on.

After the Shadow being a part of the family for about 3 years, her paint began to chip off, starting with the hood.  We thought it was because of rocks hitting the car at first, but then the areas of no paint kept growing bigger and bigger, and eventually we learned that this was a common problem among these cars.  So now she was even uglier than I thought she was to begin with.  Our local Dodge place was willing to repaint the hood and top of the car, but that was only about half the problem and they wouldn't paint the rest, so we never had it done.

Someone once pulled out in front of me while I was doing about 55 on a highway, and I hit them while driving the Shadow.  I was amazed to see that absolutely no damage was done to the Shadow, just a minor indention in the plastic bumper, but nothing else.  The other guy's car however was not so pretty.  So not only was my Shadow a persistent driver, but she was tough too.  During my wreck though, the airbag never popped out.  So until we had that checked out I lived in fear while driving my car around, because I just never knew when that darn thing was going to decide to react to my wreck and come flying out at my face.  I drove a little more carefully during that time period.

After years or complaining and moaning and groaning, I finally managed to talk my Dad and stepmother into getting me a newer car, and I am so glad.  Looking back on my Shadow experience though, I don't think I would have changed a thing.  She was a loyal car, no matter how mean I was to her she was always there for me.  I have to recommend these if you can find a nice one, since they don't make that model anymore, simply because they are loyal cars.

For the record, our Shadow is still taking care of my family, only now my Dad drives her back and forth to work.  I feel pretty sure she won't be around much longer, because I don't think he likes driving her any more than I did, but at any rate, she's still hanging in there.<br><br>
