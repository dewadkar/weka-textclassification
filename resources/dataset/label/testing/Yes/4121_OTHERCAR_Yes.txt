            I read all the epinions about the Pathfinder and noted that nobody had any comments about the Pathfinder's off road abilities.  I live in the wonderfully mountainous State of Colorado and have had more than one opportunity to take my SUV off of the pavement.  

The performance of the unit body construction is a bit lacking here, as it inhibits the frame twisting without twisting the body.  This means that in high articulation environments you are likely to create stress fractures in your glass.  The unit body design also means the SUV sits VERY low to the ground.  This causes problems when in an off road environ, especially when encountering high entry or exit angles and large rocks.

Considering the two limitations above.  The R50 series (96 and newer) Pathfinders do well off road. The front suspension has more in common to the Maxima than to the Frontier or XTerra, but the SUV still will surprise you.  The gearing allows for a relatively low crawl rate and a great ability to climb.   The air intake is placed high to allow for three foot deep water crossings without much worry.  Off road the Pathfinder(stock) can outperform some of its contemporary rivals such as Isuzu (Rodeo) and Ford (Explorer), while competing nicely with Chevy (Blazer) and coming up a bit short against Toyota (4Runner) and Jeep (Cherokee).  However, very few after market suppliers of off road products support the Pathfinder.  This means that you will NOT be able to appreciably increase the Pathfinder's off road prowess (Note that ALL models listed above have more after market support than Nissan).

If you do take this SUV off road without adding upgrades be prepared to scrape over many rocks, but also be prepared for a good time in an SUV that isn't likely to leave you out in the middle of no where.

On road performance of the Pathfinder has dramatically improved with the new 240+ horsepower engine.  Sadly, I do not have this engine and therefore struggle up highway mountain passes.  The Pathfinder is nimble and smooth on the road.  Cornering is excellent and body lean minimal.  However, make NO mistake, this is still an SUV and it still handles like one.  Please don't drive this SUV like the sports car the new engine makes it feel like.

One final note on just who can and can't fit in the Pathfinder.  Individuals from about 5' to about 6'5&quot; can fit with relative comfort in this SUV.  Being a tad over 6'4&quot; myself, I purchased the Pathfinder because I didn't fit in the Toyota or any other foreign made SUV without laying down.  However, I would NOT recommend this SUV to someone taller than 6'5&quot;.  I have family members who find it necessary to fold up like accordions to get in my Pathfinder.  If you are a tall individual the only real option in the market are domestic SUV's.  However, both Toyota and Nissan are coming out with full size SUV's soon. Here is to hoping that the seats will be designed well enough to accommodate drivers of greatly varying size.<br><br>
