            I have owned a 1991 Ford Bronco for over 1 year and still believe it to be a great truck.  My Bronco has over 130K miles on the original 5.0L engine and E4OD automatic transmission.  My truck came from the government fleet of vehicles of the U.S. Border Patrol.  It has been through more abuse than anyone can imagine.  It still runs strong and I have only needed to replace the in-tank fuel pump and the alternator.  Both were very accessible and easy to replace.  If you travel a lot (as I do), this is probably not a good vehicle option for you.  I get a steady 13 MPG, absolutely no fluctuation.  This truck is unstoppable in 4 wheel drive.  Very fun to drive, intimidating to city drivers, and nice looking.<br><br>
