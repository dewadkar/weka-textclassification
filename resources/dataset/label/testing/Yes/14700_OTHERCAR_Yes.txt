            This is a follow up on an epinion i wrote on my new 1999 forester i am a police officer and am enjoying it very much i know that the question on many minds is how it has been doing, well it is a billy goat i only got stuck in the snow and ice once in the winter of 2000 our city got a snow fall over night of about 14 inches as an emergency vehcile i used my forester one of the days it had snowed while other cars were getting stuck my forester went thur untravaled streets thru the deep snow with now problems i think i said in my 1st epinion that it is equipted with lights and siren and yes it has been involved in a pursuite or two and done well it will run every bit of the speedometer with out a hicup as it has done for me (not recomened for your forester not because it cant do it because it will LOL) i said the last time that its not very gun belt friendly but i am getting use to it. so just a follow up on the forester from me i recomend the forester to anyone who is looking for a safe dependable suv for your wife, husband or children who may be driving back and forth to college this is a very good suv for anyone who is looking for a smaller suv gas mileage is great as well <br><br>
