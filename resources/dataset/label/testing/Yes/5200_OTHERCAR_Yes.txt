            So, in 1996, I was living in New Jersey and dealing with a harsh winter and my little Toyota MR2 just couldn't handle it.  The snow, the ice, the rough roads.  So I decided to buy a new car, and chose the Eagle Talon AWD.

The AWD version has most of the luxury features that are available on the Talon: CD player, sun roof, power everything.  I greatly enjoyed having a CD player, although the speaker system could be better.  The sun roof is fun, and includes a panel you can slide across it to block out the sun when it's too hot out.  The rear window comes with defroster lines and a wiper blade, as well as thingie that squirts washer fluid.  So no matter kind of gunk gets thrown on you, you can get it off fairly quickly and keep driving.

The turbo-powered engine has lots of kick to it, although you have to rev the engine fairly high for the turbo to kick in.  Having power on all four wheels really makes a difference, as the whole car seems to just grip the road better and take off faster.  It performs great on snow, in the rain, on ice, through mud... almost never loses control.  There are limits of course, the car isn't magic, but compared to previous cars I've had, the difference in control is like night and day.  The stress of this control will wear the tires out faster though.

The cargo space is wonderful.  By folding the back seats down, pushing the passenger seat forward and folding that too, I was able to load up some 6' long boxes and still close the rear hatch.  In a 4-passenger configuration, the trunk space is medium-sized, and your rear passengers better have short legs.

With regards to maintenance, I had some initial problems with the car, in the first few months.  The electrical system and the fuel tank had defects, which the warranty covered, and after those were fixed I had no problems at all with the car.  It's run perfect for years.

If you have a large family then this car's probably not for you, but if your kids are small it should be okay.  I've considered it a very functional car, that provides reliable transportation in all weather.  So if you live in hazardous areas then this car may be for you.  One benefit this car has over SUV's is that it's low to the ground, and won't tip over like an Isuzu will.  I like it as a fun car that lets me do whatever I want, and drive whenever I want.  I've seen blizzard conditions that have closed roads and scared everyone into hiding, and my car handled it just fine.

If you don't get the AWD Turbo version though, you'll really be missing out on the major benefits of the car.<br><br>
