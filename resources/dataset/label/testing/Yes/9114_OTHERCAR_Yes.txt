            I purchased a 1994 KIA SEPHIA in California in 94.  I had just gone through a divorce, could not afford much, and did not want to have too many things to worry about.  Thats exactly what I got in the KIA SEPHIA LS.  She cost $12,000, and had to have very little maintenance.  I lived in the desert at the time, and everything worth visiting was some distance away.  Sophy, which is how I referred to my car, was perfect.  She was great on gas, and required very little maintenance.  The price was right too.  At $12000 for a fully loaded vehicle, I almost felt like I was robbing the car dealership.  The AC worked great, with no problems, and she handled like a dream.  I felt bad when we traded her in, but my family grew, and I know that the next owner will enjoy her as much as I did.<br><br>
