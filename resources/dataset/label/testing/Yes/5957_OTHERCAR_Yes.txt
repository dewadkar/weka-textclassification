            Chrysler invented the front wheel drive minivan and for many years held more than 50 percent of the market.  In recent years, however, there have been many new entrants into this category.  As a result, DaimlerChrysler's share of this important market has continued to decline even after redesigned vans were introduced three years ago. The new vans had a number of new features, including a trick console and three power doors, but lacked a third row that stowed beneath the floor. This last feature has contributed heavily to popularity of Honda&#146s Odyssey, which continues to gain sales, and it is now also available from Toyota, Nissan, and Ford. 

In response, this spring Chrysler will introduce 2005 long-wheelbase models that do the competition one better: not only will their third row stow beneath the floor, but their second row will as well. 

Other areas where the Honda Odyssey (the segment's hottest product until this year) and the Toyota Sienna (the segment's current hot thing) have challenged Chrysler are quality of interior materials and strong resale values. 

I had the chance to evaluate the interior of the 2005 Chrysler at the Detroit auto show. A few months ago I drove the model currently for sale, with conventional seats. This review covers both.

<b>Styling</b>

To my eye the Chrysler remains the most attractively styled minivan. It is conventional, but clean and elegant. In comparison, the Honda is plain and boxy and the Toyota is awkward. The Nissan offers refreshingly unconventional, sportier styling.

Inside the Chrysler is more of a mixed bag. The design is at least adequate, with sophisticated instrument styling adding a touch of class. In the upper trim lines the seats are upholstered in either a heavy grained leather (Touring) or a combination of this leather and suede (Limited). Both are attractive. But some of the materials on the instrument panel look and feel below par. The lids for the storage bins in the third row are especially cheap. This said, only the new Toyota and perhaps the new Ford Freestar offer a decidedly nicer interior. The Honda&#146s is high in quality, but plain in appearance. The Nissan features lapses in material quality as well.

<b>Accommodations</b>

The front seats in the Chrysler are very comfortable. Oddly, the offer a generous amount of lateral support, something I often wish for in the brand&#146s cars (the upcoming Hemi-powered 300 included). The driving position is excellent. An extraordinarily low cowl and beltline (base on the windows) make for extremely good visibility all-around, and especially forward. Minivans tend to do well in this area, but the Chrysler is the best by a significant margin. You hardly see the hood. I drove a Pacifica the same day. I wondered if the two would feel the same given their similar dimensions. Not at all. The Pacifica interior feels much tighter and much less airy. So if an airy cabin ambiance is your thing, the Chrysler requires consideration.

Given the low instrument panel, it helps that Chrysler has angled the controls up towards the driver. Very thoughtful. They are easy to reach and operate, a refreshing contrast to the odd controls in the Nissan Quest.

Accommodations are not so good in back, in either 2004 or 2005. To begin with, the second-row seats in both years&#151but especially the 2005 second-row seats&#151feel undersized and too low to the floor. There is no space for feet under the driver&#146s seat, compromising legroom. The second row seats can be slid backward to increase legroom, but this robs legroom from the third row.

The 2005 seats felt thinly padded and insubstantial (though leather helps them look and feel a bit higher in quality). Hopefully this was because they were not fully representative of final production units. I&#146ll re-evaluate this once the 2005s go on sale. If they don&#146t improve, it seems that Chrysler might have cut a few corners to enable the second-row buckets to stow beneath the floor. Obviously, to fit into a ten-inch-deep hole when folded they had to be thinner than conventional seats.

The third-row seat is nice and wide, unlike that in the Ford. However, it is not especially comfortable, and if the second row is not all the way forward legroom is limited for adults. In the 2005, a hard edge on the bottom of the forward face of the seat cushion pressed uncomfortably against my calves while I was in this seat. I pointed this out to a Chrysler rep, so perhaps a change will be made here as well prior to final production. If not, it again seems the focus shifted a bit much to versatility. Chrysler needs to remember than people need to be comfortable in these seats. As it stands, the Honda van is the champ for room and comfort in all three rows, with the Nissan second and the Toyota third. (There are similar legroom issues in the Sienna). The Ford has a third row that is marginal for adults, putting it in last among those mentioned here.

A rear seat video system is available in both 2004 and 2005. For 2005 a navigation system will also be optional.

The 2004 Chrysler offers a class-leading amount of cargo room if you&#146re willing to remove and store the heavy, bulky seats. But of course you&#146re not, right? The 2005 offers nearly as much cargo volume&#151at 165 cubic feet just a couple fewer than the 2004 and nearly 20 more than the three imports&#151and adds to this class-leading versatility. 

Each second-row seat folds into an under-floor bin. Nissan offers a fold-flat second row, but the Chrysler solution is superior in at least two ways. First, it results in a totally flat floor with no open nooks and crannies for small items to fall into. Second, when the bins are not in use they can each hold a good amount of stuff (they are 33 inches long, 25 inches wide, and nearly ten inches deep). 

The third row also leads the segment in versatility. First, like the Toyota but none of the others it is split 60/40. Second, in addition to being stowable beneath the floor these sections can be flipped 90 degrees for tailgating (like the one-piece seats in the Ford and Mazda). Unlike in the Nissan the tether strap is designed so there&#146s no danger of damaging your hand.

To stow any of these seats the headrests do not need to be removed (unlike in the Honda and Nissan) but they do need to be fully retracted. In the fully retracted position they hit this 5-9 adult in the upper back, which is bad for both comfort and safety. So for adults to sit in these seats the headrests must be raised a number of inches. This makes stowing the seats a bit more complicated and time-consuming, but is at least as easy as removing the headrests altogether.

The third row seat&#146s compartment can also be used for storage when the seat is upright. Together, the three compartments offer 12 cubic feet of hidden storage capacity, nearly as much as the average sedan. 

The nifty transferable console of the 2004 goes bye-bye for 2005, as it is not compatible with the new seat system. On the other hand, a modular overhead storage system is a new option. Power sliding doors and power tailgate continue to be available. 

Overall, the 2005 Chrysler is by far the best for cargo volume and versatility. I just hope the quality and comfort of the production seats is better.

<b>On the Road</b>

Performance should change little if any for 2005, as there are no major powertrain or chassis changes (with one exception). The Japanese power their large minivans with nifty four-valve-per-cylinder engines of between 3.3 and 3.5 liters. The Chrysler overhead-valve 3.8-liter V6 is antiquated in comparison, and on paper appears down on power. Its power peaks at 215 horsepower, while the import engines produce between 225 and 240. Well, peak power is not everything. Up to 4000 RPM&#151as high as most minivan engines venture much of the time&#151the Chrysler engine produces at least as much power as the Japanese engines. As a result, it feels plenty powerful in normal driving. In full throttle acceleration, especially at highway speeds, the Honda and Toyota have an advantage, but it is not a huge one.

More of an issue than the engine is the transmission. The Chrysler four-speed unit is down a ratio compared to those in the Honda, Toyota, and top-line Nissan. A fifth ratio would aid performance and fuel economy. Hopefully one is on the way.

The one major change for 2005 is that all-wheel-drive will no longer be an option. Creating the storage wells for the seats eliminated space for a driveshaft. If you want a stowable seat and all-wheel-drive, head to your Toyota dealer. If a third row that folds flat on top of the floor is acceptable, GM also offers vans with this combination of features. (The GM vans are also being revamped for 2005. The most significant changes are uglier exteriors and higher quality interiors.) 

I suppose Chrysler dealers will recommend that people who want all-wheel-drive buy the Pacifica. The Pacifica is more stylish and seats six, but like a midsize SUV offers only about half as much cargo volume. As I&#146ve already mentioned, it feels much different than the Town & Country, which will be good or bad depending on your personal preferences.

The Chrysler handles very well for a minivan, even if it lacks the independent rear suspension of some competitors. The steering wheel has a very natural feel to it, with a progressive gain in effort as it is turned. Feedback is decent, especially for this class. Best of all, the Chrysler has a light, agile feel to it lacking in most minivans. Together with the excellent forward visibility, I found it the easiest to drive coming out of a compact car. The Honda is next best in this area, the Ford the worst.

The Chrysler rides smoothly and quietly. The Toyota and Ford are probably the best in this area, but not by a large margin. Others complain about road noise in the Honda, but I also find it more than acceptable. The Nissan, in contrast, felt and sounded less solid and smooth than the others.

Perhaps Chrysler made few changes in this area for 2005 because it was already doing well.

<b>Safety</b>

To match the competition in safety the 2005 features a strengthened front structure and available three-row curtain airbags. However, stability control, available on the Toyota and Nissan, does not appear to be an option. If you regularly drive slick, curvy roads, one of these vans is probably better.

<b>Pricing</b>

A fully loaded Chrysler minivan lists in the upper 30s. However, discounts and incentives reduce this price substantially, unlike the similar list price of a Toyota. The following is a detailed price comparison from my Honda Odyssey review. This review was written a couple of months ago, so the discount and rebate information might be inaccurate. I will compile a new comparison when I review the 2005 Chrysler.

The Odyssey EX-L I drove listed for $28,980. Likely because of the increased competition, Honda increased prices only $90 from 2003. An EX with cloth would have cost $1,500 less. The only available features this van lacked were a $1,500 DVD-based entertainment system and a $2,000 navigation system, which cannot be ordered together. Unlike last year dealers are discounting these vans, but still not by much. Edmunds suggests that the typical discount reduces the price to about $28,200

The hot van is now the Toyota Sienna. The Sienna&#146s options are bundled such that to get as much stuff as the Odyssey EX-L comes with you must get even more stuff. For example, to get traction control and/or ABS on the XLE you must get the stability control (the three features come in a package), and to get side airbags you must also get side curtain airbags. To get as close to the Honda as possible I&#146ve opted for an XLE with all of the above. Toyota&#146s new system which puts everything into a huge number of packages is very confusing, but I waded through the descriptions to find the best one: #12 of 21 XLE packages. The list price of a Sienna XLE with Package 12 and floormats is $32,871, and Edmunds suggests no discounting. The Toyota is capable of being optioned much higher, but even at this price it is about $4,700 more than the Honda. Adjusting for equipment differences (sunshades, power passenger seat, stability control, curtain airbags, 17-inch wheels, power liftgate, JBL sound system, center console) would narrow this gap by about $2,350. With an approximately $2,350 price advantage, the Honda seems the better buy to me.

The most comparable Nissan Quest SL is equipped between the Toyota and the Honda. It has curtain airbags, fold-flat second-row captain&#146s chairs, rear obstacle detection, adjustable pedals, power passenger&#146s seat, power liftgate, and fixed skylights in back rows; but it has no driver&#146s side power slider, no automatic climate control (standard on the SE), and its automatic has only four speeds (a five-speed is standard on the SE). It lists for $30,030. Dealer discounts reduce this to around $29,400. Adjusted for content the Nissan is about $100 less than the Honda. It is a much less refined vehicle, so I only recommend it for those who place a high priority on styling (and like how the Quest looks).

In reaction to the Odyssey&#146s relatively low prices, Chrysler introduced value models of its minivans three years ago. A Town & Country eX with leather and side airbags lists for $30,500. The typical discount and a $1,000 rebate reduce this to about $28,000. The Chrysler has a power passenger seat and power liftgate, and its third row does not fold flat, but is otherwise equipped like the Honda. Adjusted for equipment it is about $550 less expensive. 

On the new Ford Freestar, heated seats and automatic temperature control are only available on the top-of-the-line Limited. With options to match the Honda&#146s features, the Freestar lists for $34,875. The typical dealer discount and a $2,000 rebate reduce this to about $30,400, still expensive in this group. Because of how its options are bundled, however, the Freestar thus equipped includes quite a few features not available on the Honda: stability control, curtain airbags, rear obstacle detection, and a power passenger seat. After adjusting for these features, the Ford is about $750 more than the Honda. Giving up on the heated seats and opting for the more competitively priced SEL cuts the list to $33,230 and the price after discount and rebate to about $28,900. After adjusting for content, the Freestar SEL has a $200 price advantage over the Honda. (There are many minor standard features on the Limited, such as two-tone paint and turn signal indicators in the mirrors, that I am not pricing for.) The Honda is worth the extra money because of its superior powertrain, roomier interior, more comfortable rear seats, and less rapid depreciation.

Overall, the Chrysler is competitively priced. The Honda seems a better buy to me than the 2004, but if the 2005 costs about the same and features added versatility, it will be my top pick. 

One point of concern is depreciation. The Honda and Toyota will likely hold their value better than the Chrysler. 

<b>Final Words</b>

As much as I like the 2004 Chrysler Town & Country, I would not recommend buying one unless cargo capacity and versality are not priorities. It&#146s a very good van, but the 2005 will be everything it is with much better versatility. Truly ingenious.

Rear seat comfort and depreciation are weak areas for the 2005, but it will likely be my top pick. Running first now but likely second in a few months is the Honda Odyssey. The Honda is the best for rear seat room and comfort, performs very well, and is priced very reasonably even assuming no large dealer discount. I just wish the Honda looked a bit more elegant inside and out, and a stowable second row would be nice.

Things Chrysler should try to improve:
1. Rear seat comfort
2. Foot room under the driver&#146s seat
3. Add a gear to the transmission
4. Improve interior quality, especially the 2005 second-row seats

Update: Chrysler has announced that they will be dropping prices about $3,000 with the 2005. It sounds like they're tired of losing share. It should be a good year to buy a minivan.
