               If you haven't already guessed, I have a thing for Camaros and jump at any opportunity that comes my way to pilot one of these awesome cars.
   Most recently, I have been able to drive a 1991 Camaro Z28 with the 305 engine and the automatic transmission. It was a beautiful, well-taken care of car (hard to find one that hasn't been abused) with a beautiful black paint job, that cool hood scoop and (bad?) attention-getting spoiler, T-tops, cassette player, automatic transmission, and the 305 engine.
  To start with the looks, it's nothing short of awesome. It definitely looks the part with it's wide, low stance, 16-inch tires and flashy 5-spoke rims (just like the ones in the picture for this category).
  The engine is a runner too, and is well-suited to moving it around, and doing so quickly. I might add though, that after driving 2 different '91 Z28s (both with the 305) if you're any sort of enthusiast, DO get the 5-speed, as I found the auto to be somewhat of a party pooper. I couldn't even get it to spin the tires out at stoplights, and didn't have so much of a problem doing so in the 5-speed. If you don't really care about performance the auto is alright, just thought I'd give a forewarning to those who might be looking at this car. 
  It also sounds the part with a low, menacing rumble that could only come from an American V8. Not obnoxious, and not overly noticeable at idle or at stoplights, it's nonetheless audible enough to letcha know exactly what it is you've got under your right foot. It flat runs.
  It will stop well too, as I had no problems whatsoever with the brakes. They worked VERY well, even with their discs/drums setup. No fade, no muss, no fuss, no noise.
  Getting in may be a problem for some of you as it's    l  o   w   down, so you might watch it that first time until you get used to it, but once you're in there--boy! Whatta ride!! The seats are comfortable, but make no secret of their sportscar-seat intentions. They hold you well.
  Everything you need to know is right there in front of you in the gauge cluster. Speedometer (which surprisingly only went to 110. I'm not condoning fast driving, but that seems slow for this car.), tachometer, gas gage, it's all there. 
  I immediately disliked the radio. Judging from the looks of it, it was the factory radio which included a tape player. Turning on the radio though, I found that most of my favorite radio stations either were extremely fuzzy, or did not come in at all. This fact perplexed me as they're not far away so I'm not sure why the reception flat sucked, but it's not a major problem. An aftermarket sound sytem would cure that.
  It rode and communicated pretty well, except for the bigger joints in the road and things it'd shudder and shake a bit when going over. Not a big deal to me; simply a small price to pay if you want this car bad enough. You just learn to drive REALLY, really carefully.... Another watch factor is going up steep driveways. With the long nose and low ground clearance, KNOW your limits. You learn to take everything cautiously. This may or may not be a problem for you. It wasn't for me, you just simply adapt to the car instead of vice versa.
 It was pretty steady at highway speeds, feeling calm and stable and grounded at 80mph+ as it should be. A confidence-inspiring car on the highway, for sure with it's ample power and handling ability. 
  Some notes about the T-tops.....I love 'em. I love looking up and seeing sky, with or without them on. It's like a convertible, without the vulnerableness of a cloth top and all the rigidity of a coupe, and better than a sunroof, because in these matters, bigger is better. There's simply more open air around you vs. a sunroof. T-tops will get you more looks than a sunroof will to, not that that matters, but it's an added bonus. I had no problems with them leaking, and with them off on the highway didn't produce an excess of obtrusive noise. You could tell they were off, no doubt, but it didn't kill my ears, and the wind wasn't real bad either.
  As for visibility, most of it was fine, needing no more than making sure you take a good look before changing lanes, but the long hood is something that needs attention. As stated before, always watch going up steep inclines, and turning or just driving around in parkinglots. There may or may not be as much space in front of you as you think there is.
 All in all, a superb sportster that I HIGHLY recommend. Also available with all the power niceties (power windows/locks/mirrors, albeit the former in an odd place--the center console) They are so easy to modify so you can take a relatively &quot;tame&quot; Z28 to any level that your wallet can afford. Just be sure to look around carefully for one that hasn't been mistreated and abused. A checkup by a mechanic probably wouldn't be out of order either.<br><br>
