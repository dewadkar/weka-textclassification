            I bought my Toyota Camry last year.  It is the first foreign car I have owned.  It is a four cylinder but surprisingly very peppy.  I like the way it handles on the road.  I drive twenty miles a day in it, back and forth to work. It zips in and out of traffic very easily.  It surprised me because I've always had a six cylinder car and thought this might be a little sluggish.  It still has plenty of get up and go to it a year later!

The trunk is my favorite. It is unbelievably roomy for a car this size.  Every time I go grocery shopping the bag boys always say "WOW what a big trunk".

The seats are comfy and roomy.  I am a little pudgy and I have no difficulty getting in and out.  My husband is six feet tall and he also has no problems.  I did have a problem one day because I had someone park VERY close to me and I couldn't open my door so I had to get in on the passenger side and crawl over the console.  Was not a pretty sight.

The shift has a personality of it's own.  If you have your foot on the brake you must be careful not to hit the shift because it will shift even while you are driving in it.

Another good feature is that when you shut off the key your lights will also go out.  Which is good if your the type to forget to shut off your lights.  The safety features are good.  My seat belt is comfortable and adjusts for height.  There is a light that tells you if your door is ajar, which is good if you have small children in the back seat.

I definatly recommend this car and would buy another myself.
