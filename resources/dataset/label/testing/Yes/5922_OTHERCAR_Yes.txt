            I own a 1991 Jeep Cherokee 4X4.  I bought it used.  It has 101,500 miles on it and it runs like a charm.  Previously, I have owned 3 different cars that I bought new from a dealership.  I decided I wanted a Jeep Cherokee and I prefer the older body style over the latest body styles.  I have had no problems at all with my Jeep.  I love it because it has the room of a SUV, lots of space, but it's very easy to handle and fun to drive.  I keep the routine maintenance up to date and take care of it.  Because of an unexpected snowfall, I recently had the opportunity to use the 4 wheel drive.  My Jeep was great driving on the slick ice and snow.  I passed several cars that were sliding and skidding.  My Jeep never faltered and I felt safe driving it.  I know several people who own Jeep Cherokees and they all talk about how reliable and tough they are.  My Jeep is almost 10 years old and it runs like a new one.  I know if I ever purchase another car it will be a Jeep Cherokee.<br><br>
