            I bought a 1992 Jeep Comanche for 10,000$. It is still running great and only had to go to
the shop once in 8 years. Now, I have it in my garage and I'm saving it for my son. 

  I love my Camanche. It is black and looks identicle to the one above in the picture. It is extremely comfortable and comes with AC. There is a lot of cargo room in the bed and the Camanche comes with a V8 and lots of towing power. A friend of mine bet me 100$ that I couldn't pull his boat up the MT Washington road and I did he was so suprised! 

The Camanche is a nice looking, cheap truck that has great torque, pulling power, a V8, a roomy interier, and a large bed. <br><br>
