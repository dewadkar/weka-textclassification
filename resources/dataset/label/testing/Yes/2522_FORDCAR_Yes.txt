            I purchased the car used in May 2000 with 158K miles. Initially, it had a few problems--the brakes needed replacement, as did the mufflers, belts, front tires (they were the factory originals!)spark plugs, radiator and the transmission bands needed to be tightened. However, once these were fixed, the car ran extremely well and I haven't had a problem since. It has averaged about 17 mpg in town and 22-25 on the highway, which is subpar these days but good compared to SUVs and other large cars. The engine starts and runs smoothly, the transmission shifts excellently.  You can also pull a 5000 lb trailer with the car if you get the right hitch, says the manual. The seats are extremely comfortable, and the leg-room is excellent in the front and rear.  The car gets its best mileage at 40-60 miles per hour, in overdrive.  The car is sometimes hard to park because it is very big and the edges are hard to gage, but it can be parked anywhere.  It accelerates nicely in a pinch (i.e. when someone won't let you onto the highway) but this consumes a lot of fuel.  The accelerator takes a bit of getting used to because the powerful engine makes the car surge forwards if one presses it too hard, but one adapts quickly! You can comfortably fit six passengers. The trunk is enormous. It fits a full size spare tire plus all components of my college dorm room that I take home plus my trombone and golf clubs, which are quite substantial. It has a nice quite ride on all roads, the quietest when in overdrive, and handles bumps and potholes with ease compared to other cars. The ride is smooth but not so floating that it makes you nauseated. It also holds the road well and takes turns nicely, made easier by the power steering, which works well. It's also easy to maintain a given speed on the highway, making the cruise control somewhat unnecessary, although it works well too. I can also attest to the car's safety.  I was hit in the middle of the driver's side (the pillar) by a car going 35 mph. I was completely unharmed, and not stunned at all. I needed no medical treatment. The car needed a new rear door and the frame slightly unbent. It was somewhat costly, but the car protected me well, whereas the other driver (who had an airbag and a 2000 Accord) had to leave in an ambulance. The tilt steering wheel and adjustable bench seat are easy to use and makes it possible for my 6'3" father, 5'11" me, or 5'2 mother to drive the car. As to climate control/weather accessories, the windshield wipers have many speeds and work very well, the heater is slow to warm, but once warm it is very powerful, the air-conditioning is excellent but consumes a bit more fuel than I would like, and both front and rear defrosters are excellent. In the fall, leaves in the wiper well can be annoying, and in the winter, put snow tires on the rear wheels, the car is a bit tricky (though not beyond control by any means-the brakes work well here) in the snow, probably because of RWD. I think this is an excellent, sturdily built car, of the traditional school, that is a pleasure to drive, and a safe, more fuel efficient alternative to an SUV or minivan. It is also good for a college student like me who has a lot of stuff to transport from school to home, and is reasonably priced too.
