Right up front, I need to reveal what I look for in a car, so you know where I'm coming from.  First, I like cars that are *fun* to drive -- I want some zip to it, accelerate on the freeway, good turning ability -- and I want to feel in *control* of my car rather than the other way around.  For these reasons, I prefer smaller cars and I only drive manual transmission.  But I'm not a real aggressive driver, so I don't need sports car-type performance.  Given these values I have, the Ford Escort ZX-2 gets mixed results.  There are times I can feel the engine doing what I want, but other times it feels really underpowered -- I've never been able to figure out if it's the engine itself or the way they chose the gears for the transmission.  But I still have fun driving it, especially after we got rid of the factory tires (GoodYear Eagle RS-A's) which had terrible traction in the rain and eventually blew out on us on the freeway, and replaced them with Pirelli P400's, which have *much* improved the general driving quality.

On the good side, gas mileage is great, which makes it a joy to fill up at the pump, consistently getting just over 30 mpg.  It's been tremendously reliable, with the exception of the factory tires I mentioned already.  We've been faithfully doing the oil changes / tire rotations each 5,000 miles and replaced filters at 20,000.  Other than the tires, it's never been in the shop for any reason, and we've driven it 39,000 miles now.  The price was right, and we ended up being able to afford a full package of extras (moonroof, automatic everything, cruise, A/C, etc.) for the same price we would have paid for the base model on many of the other compact sedans out there.

On the negative side, I should have paid more attention to the headroom when we were test-driving!  I'm not that tall (5'11"), but sitting in the driver's seat means my head is touching the ceiling.  I have to lean the seat back to comfortably drive.  An extra couple inches of headroom would be nice.  I already mentioned it's a bit underpowered at times, both in acceleration and on steep grades.  And at freeway cruising speed, the engine always seems louder than it should be.  It runs at a fairly high rpm, at least compared to other cars I've owned, and at 75 mph it's quite noisy.  Changing to the Pirelli tires made a huge difference in the amount of road noise we'd hear, but the engine noise is still very much there.

So, all in all, we're pleased with the way our Ford Escort ZX-2 has treated us.  I can't say I'll cry any tears when we get rid of it, but it's served us plenty well so far and we anticipate driving it for a few more years.
