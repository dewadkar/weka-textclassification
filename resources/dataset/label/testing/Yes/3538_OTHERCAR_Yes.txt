            I just bought this camera used from my father who bough it new for $249. The camera takes quality pictures for a camera this cheap. The <b>colors and tones all look nice </b>and reflect the real-life scene. However,the qulaity still doesn't compare to film. 

There are NO DIGITAL CAMERA's on the market that CAN COMPARE TO FILM. IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN PHOTOGRAPHY, GET A 35mm FILM SLR CAMERA.

The camera includes one <b>8mb card</b> (the thing that stores the photos and YES,<b> the card is REUSABLE</b>) that will store 8-9 photos when the camera is in "SUPER FINE" mode. There are 3 quality levels ranging form 640x480 (get a cheap camera if your going to shoot photos at this quality) to 1200x1600. "SUPER FINE" is <b>comparable to a FILM print of an 8x10.</b> 

You can buy additional cards in the following sizes, 8mb, 16mb, 32mb, 64mb, 128mb. I feel you should atleast buy one 64mb card. You can fit about 70 photos on the 64mb card at the "SUPER FINE" resolution.

I also recommend 4 size AA <b>recharable NiMH battery</b>'s as thing eats battery's for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and as a midnight snack. Trust me, it'll be the best investment you ever made.

To preview the photo's, there is a 1.8in LCD screen on the back of the camera. It just shows you a very basic picture of the photo's you took.

<b>The camera is rugged.</b> My father's an appraiser and uses this camera day-in and day-out. <b>He's dropped the camera several times and it still works.</b> This was WITHOUT A CASE on it.

To help prevent you from dropping it, there is a nice rubber grip on the one side. Very helpful. HP also desighned this camera to be used with 2 hands or 1 hand at a time. You can use 2 hands to help steady the camear while taking a photo. Remember, <b> this is a "POINT and SHOOT" camera.</b>

The camera weighs about 12 oz's with batterys. Not too heavy, but not too light.
Also worthy of noting: the camera is "JET SEND" enabled. This <b>allows you to send a picture to a "JET SEND" enabled printers wirelessly.</b>

The software package included is <b>fine for begginer's </b>although it's no photoshop (a premier photo editing utility). It allows you to do the basics, crop, cut, contrast, brightness, etc.

Overall, I like this camera alot.
