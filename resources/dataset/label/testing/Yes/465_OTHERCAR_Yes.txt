            Wow, what a ride. I have had my Monte Carlo for 18 months now, and I have to say this is one Great Car!! 
It does not feel like a six cylinder motor. The pick up from the line is amazing. It is very easy to be going way too fast, due to the quietness of the engine. Many times I have looked down at the speedometer and have been quite above the limit without noticing it in the drive. The response on the road is surprisingly good also. Braking and turning are two of the high points in this car. I can see the reason why Chevrolet uses TAZ to advertise their car.  I have purchased the Z34 package and it really makes the difference. Interior is all leather with power everything even the sun roof. Soft comfortable bucket seat with the drivers side being electric. Driver and passenger side airbags, with comfortable seat belts. It has a relaxing steering wheel a nice thing to have for long trips. I have driven from San Diego to Las Vegas in the car and found it to be an excellent ride. The map lights are in the rear view mirror, so when cleaning your car remember to check them, they are easily turned on when wiping the mirror. 
The only problem that I see or can't see for that matter is a very bad blind spot on both rear quarters of the car. The side mirrors are small and gives a eerie feeling changing lanes on the freeway. 
The trunk is big and the rear seats fold down, which is nice but the large trunk hinges hang low, making it not as big as you think. 
One thing I do like about the car is the automatic head lights, they do not have to be switched from day to night. This is one thing less to have to worry about. <br><br>
