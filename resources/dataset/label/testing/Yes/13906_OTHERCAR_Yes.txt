            When I discovered that I had a case of new car fever I was having a hard 
time deciding what kind of car to buy.  I found myself at the Saturn 
dealership, and I was very impressed.  
Everyone there was so nice, and nobody tried to pressure me into buying the car.  They walked me through all of the features of the car, including the safety features and gave me a few brochures to look at.  They told me to take my time, and to give them a call if I decided I wanted to buy a Saturn.  
A couple weeks later, I was the proud owner of a 2001 Saturn SC2.  The car is amazing, and when I walked out of the dealership, I knew how to work everything on the car.  My sales representative walked me through every single one of the features, and made sure I understood how it worked. 
It is a 4 cylinder car, but it has awesome power, and the engine doesn't even drag when you turn on the airconditioner.  It has wonderful standard features like a security system, remote locks, power windows, and that cute little third door for easy access to the back seat(great for people with children).  And the speakers are AWESOME!!!!  
I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who wants to have a good experience buying a car.  <br><br>
