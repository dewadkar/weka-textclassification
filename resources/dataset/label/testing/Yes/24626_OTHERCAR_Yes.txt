            On a recent trip to San Francisco, I reserved the usual compact Chevy from Enterprise car rental.  However, because they kept me waiting for over 30 minutes, they felt guilty and upgraded me to a green I30 Infiniti. Kudos to Enterprise! After driving this car for a week, I was hooked!

The automatic engine had wonderful pick up and managed to be nimble and
easy to maneuver through some of San Francisco's narrowest streets.  The car never felt underpowered even when climbing some of the steepest hills in San Francisco.  It maneuvered Lombard Street, the crookedest street in the world with easy.  It was easy to park, stopped beautifully and reliably, and didn't mind when I had to stop for a red light on a hill--I never felt afraid it might roll back.

As for the interior, well the leather seats were unbelievably comfortable.  The Bose stereo CD player was a joy to listen to.  The air conditioner, defroster, and heater all worked reliably.  For a small car, it was really roomy with plenty of trunk space.

It was such a joy to drive, maneuver, and handle, I came back spoiled.  I can't wait to get my own Infiniti I30.<br><br>
