            Just got one of these cars a week ago, to replace a lemon of a Ford. I must say it's a pleasure to drive, so far lives up to its reputation on fuel economy, and is an excellent "geek car". Here are some of my observations:

A lot of people have been asking whether you have to plug the car in to charge it. The answer is no -- in fact, when the car was on the lot, it had a big sticker on the windshield showing an electric plug with a circle-slash.
The car's main power plant is a three-cylinder engine, with a battery for power assist. The battery recharges by friction, such as braking or deceleration. You gas it up just like any other car, but it should get anywhere from 50 to 70 miles per gallon. I'm still breaking in the engine, but the readings for my first week are around 40 MPG, and going up every day. There's a little digital MPG readout so you can see exactly what kind of mileage you're getting.

In that vein, the whole instrument panel is very modern and cool -- illuminated LCD displays for everything, showing you things like when your battery is giving you power assist or charging. In fact, be careful, the instrument panel is so flashy that it may distract your attention from the road.

Another neat feature that may be disorienting at first is the "idle stop" feature. Under certain conditions, when the car comes to a halt, the engine will shut off. It automatically re-starts when you hit the gas. I guess this is supposed to save fuel when you're waiting at lights or stuck in traffic jams, but I wonder if starting the engine up again doesn't consume more fuel than it saves for short stops. It's also a big disadvantage for drag racing. (-: You also have to be careful when parking the car -- the first time I did this, the engine shut off automatically, and I opened the door before I realized that the transmission was still in "drive", and the car started rolling! It's just a feature that takes a little getting used to.

A big contributor to the fuel efficiency is just that it's a small, light car. The Insight is a two-seater -- there is no physical way to carry a third person. It's got some cargo space in the hatchback, so you can still use it to get your groceries, but it isn't a family car. It's ideal for single people or as a second car for families.

I was worried about legroom and headroom before I got into the car, but there was really nothing to worry about. It's very comfortable even for my six-foot, long-legged frame. I drive it 35 miles to and from work each day, but I don't think I'll have any trouble making multi-hour trips in the vehicle.

 Power is no problem -- before I bought this car, I was passed by an Insight on the highway while I was doing about 75. There are some long, steep hills around my hometown, and I took the car up a hill and accelerated from 35 to 55 going uphill.

The one major drawback I've found so far is that the car has some serious blind spots. There's not much rear window area compared to a mid-size sedan. Changing lanes on the highway can be pretty scary.  

All in all, the car is fun to drive, and despite the handful of things that take some re-adjustment, I think it's a great vehicle with some of the best of modern automotive technology. I'm the kind of person who prefers mass transit to driving, so it says a lot that I actually enjoy driving this car!
