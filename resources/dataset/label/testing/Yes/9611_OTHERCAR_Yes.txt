            Those who have read my other opinions know I am a car guy and a tough customer.  I have never really been a big fan of Toyota.  They have always been blandly styled.  That is the last thing you can say about this one.  I opted for the top of the line GTR model.  The car I bought has leather, and a six speed, those are the main differences between the GTR and GTS.  I have never seen a 1.8 liter with much power.  The six speed does a little better at getting up and going than the 5 speed.  The intereior is comfortable, and everything is nicely place for ease of use.  I already have put 5,000 mile on mine and took it to the Toyota dealer here in town for the first service which isn't recommened until 7,500 miles but I did it early and it only cost $38, Not bad considering the first service I had to pay for on my Saab cost $55.  So the service is reasonable priced too.  I love this car.  I do own 8 cars and this is not my favorite but this is the only car I own that cost under $25,000 so for me to like it and compare it to my others at that price Toyota did good.<br><br>
