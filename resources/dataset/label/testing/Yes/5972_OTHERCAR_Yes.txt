            Are you looking to buy a Del Sol ? well if you are looking for a fun car with a little kick, this is it! I currently bought a 1995 Del Sol Si VTEC and its the funnest thing ive ever driving, even more so than my 1981 z28 theres no comparisone, this little machine is a ball.

Pros.
1. quick
2. sporty feel and look
3. nice removable roof

Cons.
1.none!

i bought this car because my little honda civic wasnt cutting it so i wanted another honda, that was a little faster an that would catch your eye.theres nothing i hate about it plain and simply its the best thing to buy for you buck !
