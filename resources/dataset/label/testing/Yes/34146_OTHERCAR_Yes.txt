            Wow! The Lx 470 is a mean, power packed, luxury driving machiene! This car can handle the snow, sleet, rain, or whatever else kind of weather you want to drive in. I love the luxurious seats, cd changer and spacious cabin in the LX 470. 8 seats is great for a big family, and the leather tops it all off. The ride inside the car is very quiet. The car also has a lot of power, one time I was stuck in the snow in my old Isuzu Rodeo, and a man came in a LX 470 and helped me bail it out. It's a heavy piece of work!! What's not so good about this car is it's handling on corners, it guzzles gas as well, only 10 mpg, and I can hardly see out of the back. That is unsafe, however the cd changer makes up for that. All in all, 52 thousand dollars is a lot for a car, however the Lexus is Special. <br><br>
