            I bought a used 95 Lumina in 97 and Iï¿½ve only had a few minor problems with it.  The only problem of an consequence is that the pivot mechanism of the drivers seat broke about 10 months ago.  Other than that and routine maintenance, I have not had to put much money into the car.  The Lumina is very roomy, has a large trunk, and drives very well.  I have also found that it performs very well in the snow and rain.  Living in Minnesota, snow performance is a large consideration.  As I am about 6'4&quot;, room is another thing that I expect from a car.  I have found the Lumina one of the most comfortable cars that I have owned.  I would definitely purchase another Lumina.<br><br>
