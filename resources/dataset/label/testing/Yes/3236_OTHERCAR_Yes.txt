            The first thing you need to remember when purchasing this camera is that you are buying a camera for under $100. Do not expect any miracles from it and you should be pleased. I bought this camera because i wanted a camera right away, but could not afford one costing too much money. I decided to buy a stopgap camera until i was able to purchase a more advanced model. In this respect, the camera suited my needs perfectly. The following points should be noted however:

FOCUS: As purchased, the camera is focused on objects about 2 to 3 feet away. Anything closer or further than this comes out blurry. It is important when taking pictures to keep this in mind as only pictures taken within this range will be tolerable to look at.(NB. The focus is set at the time of manufacturer and can only be adjusted by dismantling the camera. It is unfortunate that Polaroid did not set the focus to infinity at manufacture to mimic the operation of conventional &#147focus free&#148 film cameras. The procedure for refocusing the lens is both time consuming and difficult. It will also void any warranty.) The novice is advised to just keep subjects between the usable range as far as possible. As supplied, the camera will produce very poor landscape shots.

SPEED: Although cameras now take better pictures, I have yet to find one to match the speed of the 820. Time from switching on to taking your first shot is less than second. This is a great advantage for users who like to take more candid shots. Modern cameras have start up times ranging from 3 to 5 seconds due to the complexity of their code, leaving you with a fantastic camera with nothing to shoot after you have missed the action. Shot to shot time is also small, about 2 seconds.

MEMORY SPACE: Capacity is about 20 800x600 shots depending on lighting conditions when the picture was taken. Because of the compression used, the camera can hold about 18 daylight shots and about 24 nighttime shots. This is very good as some modern cameras take nice 4 mega pixel shots but can only hold 4 of them on the supplied memory card.

CONTROLS: For a camera of this price, I was amazed to see the high quality LCD display on the back panel, The display can be easily viewed in direct sunlight and at all angles. The controls to the side of the panel are very well laid out and are very intuitive. 

POWER: Although the camera is supplied with 4 Alkaline batteries, the smart user will immediately purchase a set of 1800 mAH NiMH rechargeables. These run the camera for several cycles with flash before having to be recharged. And if your batteries run out in the field, you can always use normal alkaline.
