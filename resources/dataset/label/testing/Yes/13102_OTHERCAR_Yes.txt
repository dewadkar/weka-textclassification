            I bought this car brand new in '99 and I still love it just as much!  It's very quiet, even when I run it at high RPM's (it's a manual).  My last car was a BMW that was always having problems and cost way too much for any repairs or even a check up.  But now I haven't had to take it in for anything besides routine appointment and those don't cost much at all.  I wouldn't want any other car.  
When I bought this car I was going to college 4 hours away from my family and so I would drive the 500 mile round trip almost every other weekend.  But it was completely comfortable the whole way and didn't cost me a lot for the gas.

Plus the inside is the perfect size.  They've figured it so the it has plenty of room in both the front and back and yet isn't a huge car.  All the controls are incredibly easy to use as well.  I especially like having the cruise control right on the steering wheel, making it very easy to use.  I also like the fact that it doesn't have an antennae because several of my friends have either broken theirs or had problems with them.  And I still get great reception.

This is definately a wonderful car if you're looking for something that you can rely on and need for everyday use.  I wouldn't trade it for anything else!
