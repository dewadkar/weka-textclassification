            My Honda Accord (206K miles) is an excellent car and has held up well, but when I got an estimate for needed repairs, it was time to let it go.  I needed to find another vehicle that had good interior room, was very reliable, good mileage, recommend by Consumer&#146s Reports and be able to tow a small boat (mine is Boston Whaler at 750 lbs.).  Not many cars fit this category.   I read about the Subaru on a boat website forum.  I spoke to some people at work who have Foresters and they all raved about them.  One man has two he likes them so much.  I never thought of owning a Subaru.  I thought about Toyota Camry and took a test drive.  The salesman was so objectionable, that it soured me on Toyota.  Even though front drive cars like Camry can tow,  they are really not great at it if you are on a steep slippery ramp.  I test drove the Forester just for kicks.  From the outside, it looks small.  However, the interior has a lot of room.  The hatchback is great.  After the test drive and the feel of the AWD, I knew I wanted to buy it.  
The car fit and finish is outstanding as you expect from a Japanese car.  I would like to be able to buy American, but there is no comparison in the quality of design, components and under the hood look and feel.  The doors shut solidly and have a nice sound to it.  I love the boxer engine.   To me, it feels like a V6 with all the power it has.  I have the 2.5X model.   It feels like it is on rails especially if you have to accelerate around a corner.  I have no problems towing my boat.  You can&#146t even feel it back there.  I bought the Subaru towing receiver and wiring.  It was expensive, but I thought it would be more sensible to have the Subaru part and installation on an important component to the car.  
We just got back from a 2 week vacation in CT and the car performed well.  The trip was 225 miles each way and the ride was very comfortable.  My wife and I have a 1 year old son and the Latch system for car seat installation works great and is very quick to install in the backseat.  We were able to pack all we need in this car including the pack n play, high chair, toys, luggage, etc.  We did not have to use the roof rack and I could still see out the back window.  It holds a great deal.  We did not even have to fold down the 60/40 backseat.
You may not believe the mileage, but this is absolutely true.  Without the trailer, I was getting 29 mpg with mostly highway driving.  This is better than the advertised 22/27 MPG on the window sticker.  With the trailer and A/C during our trip, I got about 25 mpg.  Amazing.  Around town, I average about 24 mpg.  I accelerate slowly and do not try to race anyone out of go lights.  I also maintain the speed limit.   This mileage is great and I don&#146t think another small SUV can compare.  Also, when the winter weather snow and ice comes here in the east, this car will handle it with ease.  I am sure of this.
I love all the little things this car has inside to hold things.  You also must get the rubber cargo tray for the back.  
If anyone is considering this car, try not to pre-judge it.  I would have overlooked it if I did not test drive it.  Test drive it and you will see how great it is.  We are very happy with it so far.   I may have overpaid a little for it because the new 2004 models were coming out in a few weeks, but the sales experience at this Subaru (Miller Subaru, Mt. Holly, NJ) dealer was so good that I would definitely buy there again and recommend it others.
