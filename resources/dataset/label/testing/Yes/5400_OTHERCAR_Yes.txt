            I purchased my Canon A50 camera right before Christmas of '99. I was quite impressed at the small size of the camera. I was even more impressed when I saw the quality of the pictures it produced at 1024x768 resolution. The features are easy to figure out. The LED screen is large enough to easily view menus &amp; stored images. The camera has a good feel to it, not too small yet not too large to be carried in a pocket. Included with the camera is an 8MB CF (compact flash) card, enough to hold about 20 pictures in the highest resolution. Additional CF cards can be purchased to enlarge the storage capacity to 48MB &amp; can be easily changed. The serial interface included with the camera is rather slow at transferring images to the computer, this small problem can be solved by purchasing a USB CF card reader which transfers the files to your hard drive much faster than a serial interface. The battery that the A5 uses is barely adequate, when the LCD is used it drains quite rapidly, usually 3 days of heavy use or about 7 days of casual use is enough to drain it completely. Batteries are on the expensive side (Normal for camera batteries), but additional rechargable NiMH batteries can be purchased so you can always have another charged &amp; ready to go. Software included is very functional for quick editing of your images.
