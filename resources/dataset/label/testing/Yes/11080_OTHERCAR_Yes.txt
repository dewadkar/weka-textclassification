            Immediately prior to the Audi, I owned a VW Turbo Beetle, so trading up was relatively painless.  While the Beetle had pretty acceptable performance, and the spaciousness of a cruise liner, once I had test driven the TT, there was no going back.  

The car has incredible performance, and you have to be good with a manual transmission, since it feels like you have to shift gears every couple of seconds in order to keep up with the turbocharger.  It was initially a little disconcerting having a sixth gear, but once you unleash this car on the highway, its necessity becomes apparent.  One of the great things about the turbocharger is that you get great acceleration even in sixth gear.  

The actual layout of the car is also spectacular, and the visual feast makes driving an addiction.  I just can't wait for it to snow so I can see how the Quattro performs.

On the negative side, I have little to complain about except the standard things - forget about back seat.  I am just over six feet, and when I am in a comfortable driving position, there is exactly one inch of room between my seat back and the front edge of the back seat.  However, the back seat is still handy for storage, and the overall storage room is great for a car this size.  

The visibility is also a little limited (especially compared to the Beetle), trying to see the traffic lights when I am pulled up to an intersection has become an exercise in contortion.  The turbo has a little lag in it, but it kicks in at 1800 rpm, making it fairly easy to compensate for.  

Overall, this is an incredible car for the money, and I chose it after testing the Mercedes SLK, BMW Z3, Toyota Celica, Honda S2000 and Prelude.  No comparison<br><br>
