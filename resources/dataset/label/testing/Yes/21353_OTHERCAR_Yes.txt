            In the past I had always purchased American made cars; so, when my Ford Thunderbird died after 10 years of service, I decided to do some extensive research in an attempt to buy the best car on the market for my needs &amp; price range.

An auto specialist where I work suggested that I test drive a Toyota Camry which I did.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Camry handled superbly on the road, performance was great, and the price is very affordable.  I also test drove other cars in the same category so as to do a comparison and the Camry won by a landslide.  This car is for those that want a smooth ride... I would definitely place this car in the luxury category &amp; would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a car that's great on gas, fun to drive, durable, and stylish.<br><br>
