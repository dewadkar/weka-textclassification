            The interior hugs you as you sit down behind the wheel. The handling is quick, responsive and precise. The supercharger gives you enough power for your daily needs and the automatic transmission makes sure it's delivered correctly. However, should you opt for the six speed manual, you'll be able to fully enjoy the engine. The auto is typically Mercedes, i.e. comfort comes first. That means it will shift slow and nice, so under full throttle acceleration it feels like the car virtually stalls before the next gear is in place and the onrush of power comes flowing again.

The only downside are the seats. They're hard, and you will have a soar butt before you get used to them. But you will get used to them, so get over it.

It's $5K more than the RSX, but let's face it. You're not a teenager any more, and the C230 Coupe is practically an RSX in disguise. And now there's a 320 out too...
