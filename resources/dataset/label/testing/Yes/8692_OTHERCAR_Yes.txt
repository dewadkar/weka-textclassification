            I recently traded in a 95 Accord, which I loved, for this newer model.  And this one is just as satisfying!  From the leather interior to the built in security features, then car is great.  If someone tries to hotwire my car, I'm covered.  They want my radio?  I'm covered.  They try to break in at all, with the nice alarm, I'm covered.

This is my first two door, and I'm not overly impressed with the minimum space in the backseat, nor having to flip the seats everytime someone gets in or out, but I knew that when I was buying it.

The passenger side air bags and side air bags impress me, as well.  Along with the &quot;non-crumpling&quot; part of the exterior.

And while it looks great and has great features, the main concern is how it drives.  Well, I cannot even begin to describe the experience.  It is great to drive it, from the Accord's outstanding pickup to the smoothness of the ride.  My father-in-law owns a BMW, and the ride is almost as smooth.  I notice a significant difference between this new model and the old model in driving it, and the old model drove great.  

Of course, this takes a little bit more gas than the old model, but that's what you get when you get a V6.  I also added the spoiler, and I think it looks much better with it than without.

If you are looking for an affordable car to drive around comfortably and safely, then the Accord is it.  OF course, if you have a large family, especially a baby with a carseat, then think twice as the two-door car may present a hassel.  But that is the obvious.  In all, this is a great car for just about anybody who is looking for something in this pricerange!<br><br>
