            The time came when I needed a mini van. Many cringe at this word. They think of it as the soccer mom's chariot full of screaming children. Well, this does not hold true for the Pontiac Montana. This vehicle has been fairly trusty with the exception of some bad equipment failures.

Firstly, the engine in the Montana is powerful, that's all there is to it. The V-6 has some kick to it and when you floor the gas pedal on the highway to get around that swerving truck, the Montana delivers, usually driving you back into your seat a bit.

The interior is very comfortable too. The leather seats are comfortable but can be hard to adjust to your desires. My model also has two comfortable captain's chairs in the middle and bench style seats in the back. The dual doors are a must and the rear heat/ac controls are great for the passengers in back if they want to be in control.

Finally, my favorite part of the Pontiac Montana is the stereo system. Believe it or not, this system bumps. It has speakers in the front, middle, and back that deliver great sound. The system also has a set of equalizers to set the sound to your likings. 

Some problems with the mini-van was that the a/c has failed twice and one of the rear seatbelts locked and had to be completely replaced, and not cheaply.
