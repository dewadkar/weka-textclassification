            My husband and I looked high and low for a affordable family car. We were very pleased when we discover the Ford Taurus. Before we knew it we were put the door with a brand new used 1999 burgundy one. I don't know how I ever lived without this car before. It Is wonderful. The driver side seat has its own control to adjust the set up or done forward or back. There is even a back bar in the seat. The passenger seat is very roomy and you can even pull the middle compartment down to make a third seat in the front. The back-seat is very roomy as well. I can fit a infant carrier seat and toddler carseat and grandma back there perfect. The trunk is very huge. I put my double stroller and two umbrella stroller along with what ever else I need to carry and I still have room for packages. This car make taking long trip very easy.<br><br>
