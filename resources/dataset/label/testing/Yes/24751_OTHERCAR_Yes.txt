            This camera is fit enough for both beginners and intermediate photographers. The camera is easy enough to use right out of the box without reading the manual. Even downloading was fairly intuitive. The software allows you to access the memory stick like it was removeable media which is quite handy (using explorer!)
I like most things about the camera like the &quot;clicking&quot; sound it makes to mimic a real camera, the zoom is adequate almost all the time. The digital zoom part is seamless with the optical zoom which is nice. you just put zoom and once it's past the optical capabilities it automatically goes into the digital zoom part. no buttons to push to put it into digital zoom. and you can see the zoom part where it goes between optical and digital on the lcd screen.

The battery life is pretty extraordinary. The 150 minutes (supposed) showing on the LCD is a nice feature to let you know approx. how many minutes of camera life you have left. charging is extremely fast if the camera is off. The USB cable is proprietary it seems, and doesn't work with the type of cables that can be used on printers, desktop digital conferencing cameras, the cable is way too short too...

the pictures come out fairly good. color can sometimes be a bit on the bland side when the flash overpowers closer objects. If you change the settings to be on the manual side (setting the shutter/fstop) it's easy to get in trouble. I can't for the life of me, figure out how they would take a CCD and make it emulate shutter speed...i thought with CCD it would be either on or off, no inbetween...oh well.
3.34 megapixel capability quickly chews up memory so make sure you have a couple 64 meg sticks around with you!

the mpeg capaibility is fun. resolution is shabby but what do you expect :-). it's more for fun than real use anyhow. The audio recording part is actually quite good. had a couple recordings of karaoke that came out well, the recordings were good, even if the singers weren't :-).

the macro capabilities aren't all that good IMO. They don't focus well and come out fuzzy most of th etime for me.

I picked this one up for $550 a month ago (800.com had a 10% off cameras, a coupon, + 20% off with passport)...:-) even at 650 it's still a deal. a great camera.
