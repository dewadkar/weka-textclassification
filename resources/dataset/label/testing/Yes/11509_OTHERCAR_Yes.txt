            WOW!  That's what I have to say about my 2001 Nissan Maxima SE.  Let me tell you that if you haven't experienced a sporty sedan, this is the one to at least test drive.  I am a former GMC Truck owner and loved that vehicle.  I downgraded (as truck owners would say) to this Maxima because I was tired of paying so much money on fuel costs.  Plus, I was at a point in my life when it was time to splurge a little.  So I purchased a brand new 2001 Maxima SE model.  There are a couple flaws to my vehicle which I will discuss later though.

One day in June 2001, my wife and I went to the Nissan dealership to purchase a new vehicle, but for my wife! She had an older Buick that was falling apart and started to cost us lots of repair dollars. We did buy her a Sentra, but later sold that.  At the same time, I was just browsing at the Maxima when the dealer let me take one for a ride.  WOW, like I said earlier!  The power behind that car was amazing.  This was not the first time in the car though, I confess.  Just before we went to the dealership, my wife and I returned from a vacation in D.C. There, we upgraded our rental to the Nissan Maxima, same edition.  I loved the ride and was convinced this would be the car for my wife.  Well, who do you think got the Maxima?  Yup, me... I traded my 1994 GMC Truck in for one of these babies.  At the dealership, they had several different models with several different options.  I wanted all the options!

The Maxima SE edition I have is loaded with so many extras.  It is sterling silver on the exterior with black leather interior.  A very cool and sleek look to it, I must say.  At night, the dash turns from its day white dash to a cool blue and red display.  This is the speedometer and tach display. The options also include the best sound system you could get in a car, the BOSE premium sound system.  Hey, if you're gonna buy a sedan like this one, you'd better get the premium sound.  Not only does the Bose system add value to the car, but it also adds superior sound quality.  The radio is a combo tape deck/cd player, with the option of a six disc cd player, which is normally installed in the trunk.  This six disc cd player I did not get because they wanted an additional $1000 for; money I thought would not be well spent.  I regret not getting the multi disc player though.  All I listen to in the car are cd's.  I rarely use the tape deck or radio.  The car is all electronic inside.  The seats are electric, and even have seat warmers for those cold winter mornings.  My exterior mirrors are even heated, so I don't have to worry about ice build-up in the winter. Air bags are almost everywhere in the car.

The car's ride is SWEET!!!  It is so smooth that at times I was sitting at idle and didn't realize I had already started the car.  I notice no vibration when the car sits idle. So it is almost common for one to start the car up again even if it is already running.  (This happened to me a couple times.)  On the road, the car handles the ride very well.  The corners are smooth as well as the ride on back roads and highway driving.  If you're concerned about it's size and passing abilities, don't worry.  With the above 220 horsepower on this vehicle, there is no trouble with this car passing others on the road.  At high speeds, it still runs very well.  I have to admit, yes, I have had this vehicle over 100mph.  Hey, you got to experience it every now and then.  Of course, I've done it on roads that I know and where traffic is almost not there.  Above 100mph, the car continues to run as smooth as it would under, no vibrations.  The suspension is tight which is good for this car.  If you are used to a loose suspension, this may take a bit of getting used to, but I guarantee that when you do, you'll never go back.

Now, we have to discuss some of the negatives on a car like this.  Though, there are few, I will discuss what I have experienced.  Coming from a truck to this car, my attitude changed at the first heavy snow fall.  Again, wow... what a mistake I made of not getting snow tires.  I experienced difficulty driving this car this past winter (in the northeast of America).  When there is more than a couple inches of snow on the ground, the car really isn't worth driving.  I have the optional TCS (Traction Control System) installed in this car.  Without it, I probably wouldn't have made it through some of those snowy days of driving.  The TCS system provides just what it is intended for.. traction control on all wheels.  Although, the car does have front wheel drive, the TCS does certainly help in controlling the slippage of tires on wet road surfaces.  With the car's clearance from the ground to the bottom of the car, it stands about 5-inches above (clearance). So, if there is more than 5-inches of snow, you'd better take a taxi or jump into a SUV because the Maxima will be a bit of a challenge to drive.  

The dealership recommends for next year to purchase 16-inch rims and snow tires for better traction in the snow.  The car has odd 17-inch tires that are hard to replace.  Most places I have been to, I have to special order tires to replace on this car.  There are very few brand names that make tires for this car also.  If I do keep my Maxima, I will certainly purchase the smaller rims and snow tires for next year and rotate for the winter.  The dealer suggests the smaller rims because purchasing all season tires for the car would probably not be worth the money.  I was quoted about $210 per tire for all season 17-inch tires.  Instead, I can purchase 16-inch snow tires with rims for about $170 a set.

In summary on my negatives, the car does not handle the snow very well.  With it's low clearance and radial (non winter tires), it is more difficult to drive in the snow.  Otherwise, I have no other complaints on this vehicle.

Who should buy this car?  Well, anyone who wants a sporty look to add to their lifestyle.  I get a lot of looks from people I pass by in my Maxima.  It is a sporty looking car with the tail end fin. I forgot to mention that my Maxima also has a combo moonroof/sunroof.  This is a great feature to add to the car as well.  I use the moonroof almost all season.  Let's the cool air in and the great sounds from my Bose system out.
