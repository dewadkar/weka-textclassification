            My wife and I were looking at the Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima, and the Chevy Malibu.  While looking at the Malibu our eyes kept wondering over to the Impala.  I have seen pictures of it, although not impressed never even considered it.  In real life it looked like a classy car.  

Talking it over we decided not to drive it because it did seem a little out of our price range, we knew if we drove it it would be in our driveway that night.  Well we drove the car.  What a smooth ride, quiet, comfy with gooshy seats.  The pickup was impressive along with better gas mileage than the 4 cylinder that was traded in.  Next stop our driveway.

What really sold us was the huge trunk, enough room to put 3-4 bodies in there.  The back seat was also a major influence, roomy with room for three comfortably.  The self dimming rearview mirror is incredible technology that every car should have.  

If you are shopping for a car this one should be on the top of your must see list.  <br><br>
