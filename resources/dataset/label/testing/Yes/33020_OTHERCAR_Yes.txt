            The 1999/2000 GMC Sierra , extended cab is setting new standards for  extended cab pickups. The new trucks offer the largest interior cab space in the market, and more space is the entire reason for an extended cab truck.  With the additional space is a second bench seat that comes closest to offering riding comfort for adults.  With the seat folded down the area storage area behind the front seats is reminescent of the carrying capacity of a Yukon or Surburban.  While many people prefer the popular V-8 engines, I found that the V-6 has plenty of torque and horsepower--in fact, a friend who drives a ford f-150 thought for sure that I had a v-8 after he test drove my Sierra. Only when pulling an exceptionally heavy load such as a farm tractor have I missed the v-8 power, and when it's time to fill up the extra gas mileage of the V-6 is really appreciated.  The truck is quiet, has no rattles, and the stepside bed makes for easy unloading of my atv and camping gear.
