            I got my Neon from my sister and love it!  My 6' tall hubby and I, 5'1&quot; tall, can both drive this car with very little adjustment.  It is comfortable for both of us. I have even fit a 6' ladder in the back by laying down the back seat!  

This car has power and is fun to drive.  It makes a really great, sporty car and gets excellent gas mileage, most of the time over 35 mpg.

I prefer my van for trips and for my running around because of our three children.  This car became cramped when we had child number three.  But for going out in town by myself or just with my husband, this car is great. 

We are already telling our 10 year old that this will be his first car!<br><br>
