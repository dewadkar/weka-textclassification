            I got this camera off of Egghead and I was amazed at my purchase.  I first saw the camera when a friend of mine got it cheap off of Egghead.  It really got my attention with the size and all, but when I saw the picture quality after he transferred it to his computer, it blew my mind.  

The pictures that were in 1280X960 were of course better than the 640X480 pictures, but I would take either of them anyday.  And you can change resolution on the fly, so no restrictions here.

Now that I don't have to buy film, I take pictures of anything and everything without the worry of cost and the problem of running out of film.  Deleting pictures right from the camera makes space not an issue when it comes to this camera.  

Mine only came with a 4MB Smartmedia card and that is sufficient for the average camera user.  But I had to go out and get a bigger card.  The only real disadvantage would be the serial port connection used to transfer the pictures to the PC.  I wish you could somehow use USB.  So if you get a bigger media card, it will take forever to transfer your pictures.  Remember that.

Battery life is excellent if you use Ni-MH batteries.  That is a must: USE Ni-MH BATTERIES!  Otherwise it dies quickly.  That's basic digital camera knowledge, though.

The software is pretty basic and I had no problems at all installing.  This camera is great for starters and if the zoom would be better, I think the intermediate to advanced users would enjoy it too.  The zoom is only 2X, but it's 1.3 megapixel.  What do you expect?  I still love it and it's still going strong.  Trouble-free after using it for more than a year.  Get this camera...if you can find it.  Best bet is on the auctions.  

Don't pay over $200 for it, though.  That's what I got it for, and that was over a year ago.  Fuji is the greatest.
