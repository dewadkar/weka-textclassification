            Ever wanted an E30 M3?  The problem is that majority of old school M3's are usually raced and/or beat up by previous owners.  One's that were not abused command unbelievable prices for a 10-year-old car.

IMO, next best thing will be a 1991 E30 318is.  The car is light, quick, and economical.  This car with the 1.8 liter DOHC 4-valve engine (engine code M42) was only offered in 1991, and not to be confused with the late 80's 318i.  

The engine does not have much torque, but the over square design of the engine permitted a responsive, high revving engine that was very enjoyable.  Due to the limited power, the transmission gearing was specific to the car, and mated with a 5 speed, I think the car was fast enough and super enjoyable.  I am a firm believer in balance than a car with a lot of power with a chassis that cannot handle the load.

The M42 engine was pretty robust &amp; reliable.  Just change the oil &amp; filter every 3,500 miles, and it should run for several hundred thousand miles without a major problem.  

1991 was also the first year of the European bumpers passing EPA rules in the United States.  So the 1991 3 series BMW's did not have the old, clunky aluminum bumpers that stick out 10 inches.  Rather, the bumpers were painted in body color, and were much smaller, giving it a lighter look.  I am sure that the weight savings at the front tip if the car greatly helped handling.  

Considering the look, feel, and the perfect balance of the car, it's hard to beat the 318is.  If you can find one in good condition, I think it will bring years of enjoyment, and may become a future collector's item like the 2002.
