            We bought a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu for our daughter who is away at college.  After reading the safety reports on the steel caged construction and riding in the car, we felt this was a safe car for distance traveling. It is not only comfortable for back seat riders but offers the roominess and storage of a mid-size car for a compact price. Although classy and appealing to the younger driver,it offers affordable maintenance and gas mileage. She was able to move back home for the summer and carry most of her possessions home and still have a comfortable ride. The trunk is spacious, the seats are comfy and the leg room is unbelievable for passengers. <br><br>
