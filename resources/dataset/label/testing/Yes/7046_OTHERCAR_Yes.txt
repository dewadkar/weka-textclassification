            My first Mazda 626 was a 1982 model.  I finally gave it up after thirteen years when the clutch went out - THE ORIGINAL CLUTCH. (yes, I was actually able to sell the vehicle after 13 years!)  It was a little 2 door coupe five speed that could get around anywhere - including through the piles of Nebraska snow.  After 13 years, the car had a little rust, but the engine never burned oil - was never a problem. It did not have a lot of options, but even then, Mazda was forward thinking with the adjustable lumbar support, seat height adjustment, and rear seating heat vents.

I have since graduated to the 1994 version of the 626 and find myself even more impressed with Mazda.  They have come into their own with this particular market.  Again, after all of these years, the Mazda product integrity is better than ever.  The doors shut like a higher priced vehicle - the sound you hear is quality.  The interior is roomier than the Camry or the Accord - even the back seat affords lanky passengers the room they need.  I have the LX package which is the middle of option packages for Mazda, which includes a great stereo system - not even a brand name, but great none the less, along with a power sunroof, alloy wheels, a rugged interior fabric that holds up to even the toughest punishment.  A fun feature is the oscillating vents on the dash circulate the air nicely - even for rear passengers

The 626 I drive is a five speed.  It gets me anywhere on any given day, regardless of the weather conditions in the midwest.  The body integrity is superior compared to the seems - like -  always - rusting Hondas.  That is a big concerned for us in the midwest due to the salty streets in the winter, which can tear up a cars finish in no time.

Who should drive the 626?  Anyone with children, pets, who needs cargo space (rear seats fold down into the ample size trunk)or who carry passengers on a regular basis.  Anyone who enjoys one of the quietest running cars in the industry!  (so quiet the system is patented) or someone who needs a very dependable automobile.   I have had five adults in my car with no big complaints about pinched off limbs!  The car is great getting in and out of traffic, for roads trips (great mileage) and is a very reliable car.  If any of you remember Sylvia Porter - the financial consultant that used to be published in news[a[ers when I was a kid - you may remember her advice:  Drive a new car until it drops.  If you purchase the 626, you may only need one or two your WHOLE LIFE!  At least, that has been my experience with both of the cars I have had. 

Noteworthy:  A good friend of mine rode with me enough that she bought her own instead of the Camry she had been testing.
