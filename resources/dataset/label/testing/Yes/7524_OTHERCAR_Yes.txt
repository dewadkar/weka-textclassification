            I purchased my used Dodge Stratus 3 yrs ago. At first I loved it, actually adored it. I loved the acceleration speed it had and the handling was great. But the longer I have it, all I can say is I am glad I bought the extra warranty...At first, it was a few minor things here &amp; there, then the 2nd yr I had my Stratus, the transmission went out. That would have cost me over $2,200.00. 
There have also been quite a few recalls on the vehicle. It really is a nice vehicle to look at and it is very roomy inside. Who knows, maybe I got tossed a lemon? <br><br>
