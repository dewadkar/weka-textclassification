            The Toyota Sienna is an awesome van- easy to park, seats 8, has storage and cup holders everywhere, good power and fun to drive.  Hard to get but worth the wait and extra cost over the Honda, Nissan, Ford, Chrysler and other vans out there.

We have been looking for a new van for several months.  The Sienna was better than any other van we tested: Honda Odyssey, Ford Freestar, Chrysler Town & Country and Nissan Quest. We liked the Honda Odyssey, it has nice features in the interior- adjustable power driver's seat, leather, storage and easy to get what you want.  However, after driving the Toyota and finding it easier to park (shorter wheel base), we felt a quieter engine and way more flexibility on the interior configuration we decided to buy the Toyota.  We wanted an 8 passenger version.  Currently in California the dealers claim Toyota is only making and shipping LE's (none of the less expensive CE's anywhere).
Dealers won't negotiate since supplies are limited at this time.  Can't easily get the color and option mixes you want.  We wanted the LE in an option package with the air bags vehicle stability control, traction control and 4 wheel disc brakes but not the DVD.  This proved hard to find and when we could find it, the color choices were very limited and the wait was 4 weeks.

When the van finally arrived a month ago we were not disappointed.  We have 3 children and with an 8 passenger van they can now all bring a friend on weekend trips and we still have room to stow gear behind the rear seat.  The van is very easy to maneuver, quiet, good power, good visibility, comfortable seats and lots of great storage.  The layout of the controls is much better than the Nissan Quest and all though its not as plush as the equivalent Honda Odyssey inside, its a lot more flexible, with safety on a par with the best in class Honda Odyssey and Ford Freestar.  It is a great family vehicle that I would strongly recommend.
