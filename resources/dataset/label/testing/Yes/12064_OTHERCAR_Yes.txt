            I 'owned' this car for a about a week. It was a triple black (black leather, black top and black color) Carrera 4 (4 wheel drive) convertible.

I drove it both on bay area parking lots (I mean freeways!) as well as city streets.  This is one of those cars which gets the 'second look' from the people on the road.  It feels extremely powerful and has sleek styling.  The dashboard is well laid out and has some neat features like 'miles to go before your gas runs out'.

On days with light rain this is definitely the sports car to drive with its 4 WD its traction is great and leaves all the other 'sports car' behind.

It is $$$ anyone who likes a fast start at the light so that they can get ahead of this big red SUV should go for it.
