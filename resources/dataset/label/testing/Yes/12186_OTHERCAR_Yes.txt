<b>Overall</b>
I had to drive the 2001 Pontiac Trans Am and was I impressed. It handled the road great making sharp curves with no problem at all. The take off is tremendous it will push you back into your seat as you hear the rear tires starting to squall. This car is truly a muscle car of today. 

Braking was great, you could lock up the brakes and not make them squeak, it stayed in a fairly straight line during any sudden braking.

The sound system in it is unbelievable, Pontiac did their homework here. 

The things that are least attractive to buying this car is it a little cramp in there, even though I could stretch my long legs out. There is practically no room for adults in the back, very close. Another downside is the ride, since it is so close to be road and the big wide tires, the ride isn?t bad. It rides almost as good as your compact cars.

It is a powerful, great handling sports car!

The looks of the 2001 Pontiac is beautiful all the way around it, I highly recommend it.
