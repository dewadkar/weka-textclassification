            At the time we purchased this vehicle, we were trying to find a car within a reasonable amount of time.  Our previous vehicle had been a Saturn, and it had been written off by the insurance company due to an accident.  When we first saw the 1998 Ford Taurus, we decided that was the car we wanted because it was nice and spacious, had low miles, and had a nice quiet engine.  We did not go to a Ford dealership to purchase this car.  We were renting a car from a local car rental place and found out that they also sold their rental cars after a certain amount of time.  The price of the care was under 15,000 which was great for us because we could have a nice care with a limited budget.  These cars are purchased brand new and used as rental cars.  The maintenance records and history of the se cars is accurate and up to date.  The other quality I like about the 1998 Taurus is the roomy trunk.  We recently took the vehicle on a long road trip to Texas and of course the car did great.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who does not want a brand new car, but does not want one with too many miles. <br><br>
