            In 1990, I bought a slightly used (10k mi) Prizm.  It was a 'program' car.  I was tired of driving a small pickup truck and wanted instead a reliable economy car.  Looked at Toyota Corollas and then ... found the Prizm at a Chevrolet dealer.  I test drove the car and liked immediately took a liking to it. The car was 'peppy', the A/C worked great, the Delco radio had 4 speakers and sounded very good, driver visibility very good, rode nice, and everything under the hood was accessible.  I do my own servicing so this last feature is important.

For a small car with a 1600cc (97hp)engine coupled to a three speed automatic, the car gets down the road well enough for me. Turn on the A/C and of course, acceleration is compromised.  Fuel mileage on the highway is about 32mph, 26 all in town. Handling and steering is light and has not deteriorated with the miles, which impresses me. Brakes are a light touch affair and work quite well during very hard stops.

I still have this car!  The odometer now shows 257,000 miles and the engine is still going strong!  Oil consumption is about 3,500 miles to a quart of Mobil 1.  The automatic transmission overhaul has been the only major expense that occured at 180,000 miles.  I attribute the long life of both engine and trans to plenty of preventative maintenance performed by myself.  

The Prizm is a very easy car to drive and does not do anything badly.  The later model Prizms have a front stabilizer (roll) bar as standard equipment whereas my 1990 has no front bar.  Also, I would suggest that anyone purchasing a new Prizm who expects to spend a fair amount of miles on the interstate to buy the four speed automatic.  The four speed overdrive unit delivers a few more MPG over the three speed transmission.
