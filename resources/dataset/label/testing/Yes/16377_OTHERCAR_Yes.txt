            I have always loved playing around with photography and when the digital cameras first came on the market they were way to expensive.  But &quot;tah-dah&quot; a HP ad in the paper - buy one of the qualifying color printers and the digital camera and receive $100 rebate.  This rebate expires 01-29-2000.  Visit HP's web site for the details of the rebate (www.hpshopping.com). Plus with another special rebate partnership between MicroCenter and E*Trade I also rec'd $400 credited to my E*Trade account. Since I was willing to purchase the demo model of the camera the store (OfficeMax) also gave me an additional 30% off ($30). So the camera, printer, additional flash/memory card, printer cartridges, cables only cost $169 - A GREAT DEAL!!!
One of the accessories I would highly recommend for this camera is the SanDisk Compact Flash Memory Card Reader / USB Connect (#SDDR05) - approx. price $36 &gt; $50.00 (check out bestbuys.com for the best price).  This will save you a ton of batteries, plus the pictures will down load so much faster to your pc.
The very first night I had the camera I had to wait for my dad to finish playing with it before I was able to take some additional pictures of the christmas tree.  Then the next day I was downloading and editing them.  The software is very easy to install and fun to play with.
I am able to save the pictures to disk and e-mail them to family and friends.<br><br>
