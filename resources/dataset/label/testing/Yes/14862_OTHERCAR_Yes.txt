            I really love my new Sebring Coupe. The car is basically a Mitsubishi Eclipse that has been lengthen and widened. The Dodge Stratus R/T Coupe is almost identical to my car as well.

PROS: This car always seems to garner looks from admirers. It has an extremely smooth ride and decent acceleration. The car has a very quiet ride.  For me, the car strikes a balance between luxury and sportiness. The car has a pretty good sound system with the 7 speaker Infinity system.

CONS:  Because I like to complain, I will list every problem with the car that I have found.

-The low roof-line of the car makes it difficult me to see traffic lights when I'm waiting for the light to change.

-The cruise control seems especially sensitive. It always cuts out at the slightest bump or incline. It's like it's on a hair-trigger or something. 

-This car has a really low front-end. You have to be really careful while pulling-in to parking lots and going onto uneven surfaces because the front-end will scrape.

-The car is hard to back because the rear-end is considerably higher than the front.

-I used to drive a 24-foot Mack Truck that had a smaller turning radius than this car. The turning radius is not very good at all. No such thing as a 3-point turn in this thing. Try 4-6 points. I have even had trouble pulling a U-turn on four-lane road.

-The front cup is to far forward to put anything other than a 12-ounce can or small coffee cup in. The other front cup holder can holder can hold larger drinks, but gets in the way of the gear shifter. Ergonomically, it's a crappy design.
