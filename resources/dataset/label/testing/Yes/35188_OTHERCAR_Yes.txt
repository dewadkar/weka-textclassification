            The LAND ROVER DISCOVERY is a great car. It provides it's passengers with luxury and comfort. The interior is covered in soft and plush leather. The pads of the seats fit to you, and are one of the most comfortable seats I've sat in. It looks great also.

It is one of the safest cars out there, as expected from a huge car like the DISCOVERY. If you don't believe me then think of all the Range Rovers you see on African safari's.

This vehicle is an ideal car for people who drive gravel or dangerous roads everyday, or at least twice a week. This car is not to be bought by a person who does stuff only in towns or cities. The reasons are as followed: doesn't handle incredibly well, uses a lot of gas in traffic, to big for parking spaces, and it doesn't fit in some small parking garages.

As with all SUV's for the shorter and older people it may be harder to get into than other types of cars such as sedans and convertibles. But then on the other hand those other cars aren't nearly as safe. The other downside to every SUV including this one is the low gas mileage.

The LAND ROVER is my third favorite SUV. My first and second are the LAND ROVER DEFENDER 90 and the LINCOLN NAVIGATOR. Also note worthy is the HUMMER and the new HUMMER 2.<br><br>
