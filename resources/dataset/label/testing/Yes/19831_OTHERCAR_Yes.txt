            In 1996 my wife and I spent many hours shopping around for a new car.  We stopped by the Chevrolet dealer and test drove a used 1995 Impala SS. At first we marveled at its roominess, but as I drove more I found that within this large, comfortable car beat the heart of a sports car.  We discovered that the Impala SS used the same V8 engine that Chevrolet used in the Corvette ZR-1!  This seemed like the perfect car for us: large, comfortable, with enough guts to get out of trouble, and enough safety features to survive should we not be able to avoid a collision.  

One must be careful though when buying these, especially since Chevrolet has come out with a &quot;toy&quot; version of the Impala.  Do not be fooled!! The new Impalas can not come close to the performance of the 1994-1996 Impalas.  So do yourself a favor. Instead of going to the Chevrolet dealer to look at the new Impala, scour the classifieds and Internet to find a used Impala.  They really hold their value, and once you step on the gas, you'll know why!!<br><br>
