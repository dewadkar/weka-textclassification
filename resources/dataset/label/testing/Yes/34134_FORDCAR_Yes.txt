            After my husband had his heart attack, we had to get rid of my Ford Probe. I knew then that it would be problems all the way.  There always is when you are buying a used car. Usually you are buying someone else�s problems.

Well while we were looking, my husband spotted this Crown Victoria in the paper. It had low mileage on it and he wanted it.  The guy that was selling it was selling it because his grandfather had Alzheimer and he was not allowed to drive it anymore.  

We arranged to go and look at it. The guy said that there were a couple of other people that were on their way to look at it and the first person that got there. It first come first served and there would be no cutsies.

So we flew there as fast as you can in a puddle jumper. Tee Hee.  I was secretly hoping that when we got there the car would be long gone.  I did not want any big honking car. My husband wanted it only so that he could sell it and make a profit off it.  It was getting dark when we got there and I am night blind. I did not want to be driving a big car home on the freeway. One that I was not use to. I was use to driving small cars.

Well as luck would have it, the car was there. The other people had not arrived, probably because the guy did not give good directions. If he had, we would have been there 15 minutes earlier.  My husband wanted me to test drive it. I didn�t want to. I told him to.  He test drove it though the apartment complex and came back with a big grin on his face.  He wanted the car, not for him but for me of course.  

The guy told me while we were waiting for my husband to get back that the car needed to be cleaned inside. His Grandpa got Alzheimer and they had to take the car away from him. He would take it places and forget where he was. He had a little dog foofee and foofee was missing. No signs of foofee except for the dog hair all over the entire inside of the car.

The car only had 12,000 miles on it and had all the papers inside of it where it had been maintained regularly by Grand Pa. .

The engine was huge, and it was a V8 and when you stepped on the gas in it, the car flew.  Everything in the car worked. It had Power everything. Air Conditioner, Radio, Clock, Trip Meter, Power Windows and tape player. Cruise Control.  The car was built for speed and hot pursuits.

What I did not like about the car. When it rained I would always skid and slip and slide when I would take off from a dead stop. This was not done on purpose either. It was impossible not to fishtail in the car when it was wet out.  The tires had the proper air in them. It just had too much power.

I drove the car to the Casinos near the beach and took my daughter. I thought that would be a good test drive for it.  It was comfortable and you could have fallen asleep in the car. It was too comfortable.  The air conditioner worked very well for a car that was that old. The car had been well-taken care of. Except for the hair that had to be removed from the dog.   

I decided after too many times fish tailing and almost throwing myself and anyone that was in the car through the front window, with the power brakes that the car was going to have to go.
The power brakes were so touchy that just tapping them and that was all it took.

We sold the car to an old lady, and all the manuals went with it. My husband was happy because we did indeed make money off the purchase of the car.  We got a bargain and she got a bargain.

There was plenty of room in the back seat for three passengers and maybe four. Three passengers could also sit in the front. There was an arm rest in the front and the back seat. ,
Crown Victoria�s are luxury all the way.  They are just too big for me.  With the price of gas, I am glad that we got rid of it.  There have been a couple of times that I have regretted it though. None of the cars that I have bought to replace it have been nearly as reliable as that solid built car.

I should also mention that the trunk was huge. It reminded me of the ones that I use to hide in when my sister would sneak me and my girlfriend into the drive in. It would have been plenty big enough for the both of us.
