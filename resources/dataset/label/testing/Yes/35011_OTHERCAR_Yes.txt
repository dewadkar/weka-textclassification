            I bought a Mitsubishi Mirage because I needed a small economy, reliable car for school.  I fell in love just with the looks of the car at first.  It's got that small sporty look.  It's very efficient on gas, even my mom, now and then, trades cars with me so she can save on gas.  I have had my Mitsubishi Mirage since I graduated from high school- I'm now graduating from college, and I have had no problem with this car.  The only complain, I would have is that it doesn't have enough room for my baby's car seat.  If you have children this is not the car for you.  I do recommend this car highly for the young single-students, who want a economical way of getting around while still looking good. <br><br>
