            This is an excellent camera for those looking for something around $600 and want a camera that can just about do it all. Operationally the camera is very easy and intuitive to use with simple controls yet in the manual mode you have a lot of control over focus presets, shooting modes, white balance and more.

As a professional photojournalist who has used the $8,000 Canon D2000 I can say that the image quality of the CP950 is very close when used in normal lighting conditions. In darker situations the $8K camera is better (the D2K can ramp up to 1,600 ISO) but the CP950 does have a built-in flash. I've been able to use the CP950 for daily newspaper photo work, even for quick wire service work. It takes getting used to the shutter lag when shooting fast action but it's predictable after a while.

The best thing about buying the CP950 is the range of accessories. Nikon has a fisheye, wide angle and telephoto accessory lenses that work great. The wide angle isn't perfect as it exhibits barrel distortion but this can be fixed in Photoshop via filters. But the fun doesn't stop there, visit http://www.ckcpower.com and buy an accessory super-telephoto that gives you the equivalent of a 920mm lens! Nikon even sells a flash bracket that takes their Speedlights for that extra oomph when needed in dark places. See here for sample photos with the accessory lenses that will get you from 35mm film equivalents of an 8mm circular fisheye lens and 920mm super telephoto: http://homepage.mac.com/mediabaron/PhotoAlbum2.html

The next must have accessory is the Xtend-a-view eyepiece by http://www.photosolve.com that allows you to turn the LCD screen into an electronic viewfinder even on the brightest days outside. This is essential if you use any of the accessory lenses as it will give you true SLR operation.

The last accessory if you're a heavy shooter is an external battery pack by either Unity Digital or Quantum Instruments (I prefer the Quantum QB1+ since this can also power your Nikon Speedlight).

The only downsides are a plastic tripod socket near the edge of the body and some CP950s had defective mode switches which Nikon fixes for free.<br><br>
