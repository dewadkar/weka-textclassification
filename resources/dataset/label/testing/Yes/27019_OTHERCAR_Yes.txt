            I was in the market for my second digital camera. I decided that I wanted my digital pictures to have more quality then I was receiving and decided it was time to make the jump into a more expensive camera but I definitely wanted to have a camera that was easy to use.  I was looking for good quality of the final pictures, zoom functions, a clear and good sized video monitor, the ability to view and delete pictures as they were taken, a good flash that could control red eye and that had auto function to determine need of flash and a camera that was basically easy to use.  I found all of this in the Olympus D-450Zoom.

The Olympus D-450Zoom uses AA batteries which I find readily available everywhere so I am never without power.  Olympus D-450Zoom does tend to drain batteries rapidly if you use the flash and video display constantly.  I did invest in the optional power cord which really saved a lot of batteries during the download of the pics from camera to computer.  This is an option I would definitely recommend.

I would also suggest buying a second film card.  This allows you to store many more pictures especially if you are going to be away from your computer for awhile before your download.

This camera is very easy for a beginner to use but it also has many options for the camera buff who wants more then a point and shoot camera.  The manual that comes with the camera is very well written and easy to understand.  The Olympus D-450Zoom allows the options to use a specific file name for the pictures or it uses a built in numbering system for cataloging your pictures.  The Olympus D-450Zoom also allows you to put a time and date stamp on each picture.  When viewing the pics you have the option to view one at a time or change to view as many as 16 on the display at one time.  The Olympus D-450Zoom has a battery low monitor that will give off a small tome when your battery needs replacing.

I am very happy with the quality of pictures that I am receiving from my Olympus D-450Zoom.  The Camedia computer program for post processing of your pictures is very easy to you and allows you to insert your own text on to the picture prior to printing.  If you do not have a computer the memory card can be inserted directly into an optional printer made for use with this camera that will download and print your pictures.  This is wonderful for those who do not want a computer.  I have also found this nice to have as it is portable enough to carry with you on a trip so you can shoot and print while away from home.

Overall I am very pleased with the purchase of the Olympus D-450Zoom.  I gives me the picture quality I was looking for and it is very easy to use. I did find the Olympus D-450Zoom a bit pricey but I guess it goes with the old saying &quot;You Get What You Pay For!&quot;<br><br>
