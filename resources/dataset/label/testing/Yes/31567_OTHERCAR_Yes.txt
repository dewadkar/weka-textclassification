            I have driven a 1985 Volvo 240 DL for 3 years. Although this car has relatively low mileage (110,000), my review includes experience with at least 8 Volvo cars (model years 1977-1993).  
The Volvo is the simplest car to drive. It's small size and incredible turning radius allows for great mobility in busy traffic. Also, Volvo is known for its safety. Last year, I rear-ended a stalled car at 20 mph with nothing more than minimal bumper damage. 
The Volvo is perfect for young drivers. It's lack of frills should restrain reckless driving. It's appearance is not appealing to would-be thieves and offers a comfortable feel in poor and rich neighborhoods alike. The heat system is legendary.
On the con side, the steering wheel is heavy (it builds muscle). The older stereos are analog, only allow 3 FM and 2 AM presets, and some do not include tape decks. Volvo parts are expensive.
On the pro side, none of my Volvo's have required major service. The only serious problems were results of accidents. <br><br>
