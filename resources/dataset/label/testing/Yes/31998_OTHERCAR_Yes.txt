            This is the second digital camera that we have purchased.  The first one was your very basic, bottom of the line camera that did not allow me to see the picture after it was taken - it had to be up-loaded to the PC to view.

This HP is a snappy little thing, it takes awesome pictures, not matter what quality setting you use.  There are three quality choices, Regular (approximately 35 pictures with a 16 meg card) Fine (Approximately 17 pictures) and Super Fine (Approximately 10 pictures).  The amount of pictures depends of course, on how much memory each proceeding picture uses.  I like the basic regular setting for trips to the zoo and the like because they are easily attached to email.

I use the Fine and Super Fine for posting pictures to my Ceramic Shop online Web store.  There are also 2 Zoom settings.  You can crop and edit pictures while in the camera or after being uploaded.

The software that came with the camera is easy to use and manipulate to get just the right effect.

I love the digital screen that shows you exactly what picture you just took so that if it is not right you can delete right there and take another!

This camera uses 4 Double A batteries, I went ahead and got the re-chargable ones and I have not yet run out of power before I ran out of pictures.

I find that I take a lot more pictures with this camera that I actually get to see...because with the old camera and the film processing ect, I have a drawer full of film rolls and no idea what is on them!  This way they are all stored in my hard drive and it is easy to keep my parents and family abreast of all that our family is doing and I can even show them!

This may not be the camera for the "Professional" photographer, but for someone that just likes to take pictures, this one is perfect!  The only thing I can complain about is that once you have adjusted your settings, if you turn the power off instead of letting it go into power save mode, you have to reset the settings again, but that is not that hard anyway~
