            The Buick Roadmaster Wagon is the perfect car for anyone who wants to be able to haul a lot of cargo but have a touch of luxury.  Say you doing home repair, maybe building a deck.  You are going to have to buy the wood to make the deck, right?  The Buick Roadmaster Wagon can hold a lot of weight.  You could get most of your wood in one trip.  

Let me give you another scenario.  Its a special occasion, lets say a wedding anniversary, and you want to take the family out to dinner.  This car has plenty of room in it.  It also has the luxury that you want to have. 

 This car has a beautiful interior.  Leather seats, plenty of leg room, anything you want.  This car is equipped with power windows and locks, AC and Heat.  It also has a rear window wiper for those rainy days.  Another great thing about this car is that it is safe.  In an accident, it is better to have a large car than a small one.  Overall, this is a great family car.<br><br>
