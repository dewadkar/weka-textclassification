            <i> * Note - While some women may know a lot about the interior working of cars, I am not one of those women.  I know what features I am looking for, and it is these features that I will touch upon during my review* </i>

I have a 97 white VW Jetta and <b> love </b> it! I have had the car for 2 1/2 years now, and the only problem we ever had happened 2 weeks after we got the car.  We towed it to Volkswagon and everything was covered under warranty.

Volkswagon is the <b> only </b> car anyone in my family drives - that's right, my mother, my father, my brother, my husband, and myself all own one.  The family usually has either a Jetta or a Gulf, my husband and I only driving Jettas.  Being a VW owner for years, and growing up with these cars, I can honestly say that out of all of the family members we have had <b> few </b> repairs or problems, and all things have been pretty &quot;typical&quot;.

We like everything from the dealership to the car itself.  It is hard when you live in certain areas to find a dealer as they are not in every town, but ours is nearby.  Knowing that we are such loyal customers, we always receive wonderful repair service.  I actually bought my white Jetta from the woman who worked behind the counter at the repair department!

There have been many features I have really liked about owning this car.  The  gas tank holds more fuel than other cars I have owned in the past (Dodge Colt - what was I thinking?).  As I mentioned before, since that initial time, I have not had to take my car in for repairs.  The steering wheel has a range of positions you can put it in to fit your comfort level.  Jetta's have <b> huge </b> trunks, making it easy for me to fit the baby's stroller, gear, groceries and the like easily inside.  My car has fog lights, making it easier to see and be seen when driving to work in the early morning, especially when my car is white.  The windows are manual, but there is a door lock button so I can lock all the doors from the driver's seat.  The car comes with an alarm system, and it beeps when locked and set, so I never forget.  It has cruise control that works well, though I rarely use it.  One of my favorite features is that when I leave the lights on and turn off the car, it plays an extremely noticeable tune (My dad calls it the &quot;La Cookaracha&quot; song).  

Some features I have not liked are the manual windows, as I prefer electric for convienience.  Also the cup holder is in a <b> horrible </b> location.  It's in front of the emergency break and set by 2 circle indentations.  The only things that fit in their are small drinks, like a small size soda from Burger King or McDonald's.  As I like to carry glass bottles of juice or iced tea, I find myself having to wedge the bottle on the side of the emergency break.  Also I don't like the High Beam lights switch.  You have to keep clicking it on and off by pulling it towards you; We had a Mazda that you just clicked once away from you and that was easier.

I know that there are many VW fanatics, I am sure you have seen the commercials.  There is a &quot;secret&quot; wave I am told between many VW owners while driving.  Also, some owners are committed to upgrading the features in their car, my brother being one of them.  It has been easy for my brother to find parts and additions on the Internet (try Ebay auctions or searches for VW parts) and in specialty shops to make his car unique! He bought a P-FLOW, stickers, changed all the exterior and interior lights to red, changed all the locks and buttons to silver. You can take your love of your VW to whatever level you can afford.

When we go home, there are VW's all in the driveway and up the street.  Besides amusing our neighbors, we <b> all </b> feel secure in driving what has been, <i> for our family</i>, one of the best cars we can buy.
