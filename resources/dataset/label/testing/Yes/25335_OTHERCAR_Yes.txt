            This is my new car, you guys.It is a little on the expensive side though... mine is loaded with everything; even with leather seats.We have had this car for 10 months now and have already put 22 thousand miles on the baby!We have gone cross country twice.

We had a wonderful customer service when we bought  the car ;with  friendly faces and no hassle.Paper work was done very prompt. The car is excellent. We love it.It drives smooth. But is a gas sucker and a half. If you don't get the oil changed on time, it has a different sound though.It looses it's purr.. not sure why though.So i change my oil on time now .

It is very roomy and comfortable for trips. It is comfortable to ride in all of the time actually!It resembles the Ford Contour a little too much though. I paid a lot more than the price of a Ford Contour for my car  and I wish my car had more of its own and look  and personality ... but over all it is great.<br><br>
