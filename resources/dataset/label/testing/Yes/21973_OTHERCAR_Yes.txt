            We love our van! Bought this used, and it's a 'semi-conversion'. Our previous van was a caravan and with 4 kids and two dogs, we needed more space. This gives us that and it's been VERY reliable. The van had 76,000 miles on it when we purchased it. It's been a nice transition moving from a caravan to this van because of similar dash, steering wheel. I recommend the conversion captains chairs-they are THE most comfortable seats I've ever sat in in a car I've owned. The van has a few cons beside being a gas guzzler and rear-wheel drive (bad in snow and I live in snow country). The doors are clunky and need to be slammed (it's not an issue of needing lubrication-they're just clunky and heavy no matter what) The double side door is nice though clunky. The mirrors are great and the handling is fine, typical rear-wheel drive, not as responsive as front wheel drive but it's a big van and I haven't had any major problems handling it. My mechanic isn't thrilled when I bring it in for service-the access cover inside the van isn't his favorite thing to deal with but I don't work on the van so it's nothing to me! The heat/air system is fine except would like a choice between having the air come out the bottom or top or both and that's not a choice with this van. The basic Stereo/Cassette is nice quality, I like to blast music when alone and it sounds quite nice! Can move kiddie music to rear speakers when needed, so I need not listen as closely! Has plenty of room to add a TV/VCR which we plan on doing. Cruise control has been smooth and easy to use-the same type (same buttons at least) that I had in my caravan and it's VERY easy to use. The maintainence on this van has been affordable and it has had no major mechanical problems.
