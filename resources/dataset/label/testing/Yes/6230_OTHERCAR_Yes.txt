            It's also the only truck I've ever had, but I sure do like it a lot.
Because of a recent accident where I was rear-ended, I was compensated nicely for my lemon of a car and decided that, rather than continue to maintain, repair, and be limited by my old hunk, I would look into leasing a new car.
I then realized that, at my age, I'll be doing a lot of moving in the next few years, and it would be really nice to have a pick-up.

The three trucks that I compared were the Ford Ranger, the Nissan Frontier, and the Toyota Tacoma.
After doing some research, I found out that the Ranger was more hype than performance.  I'm also not a big fan of American cars.  That left the Nissan and the Toyota. Further research showed that while the Frontier offered the same power and performance as the Tacoma, it was a few thousand dollars cheaper.  I also found the Frontier to be more aesthetically pleasing than the Tacoma.  I chose a Regular Cab as opposed to the King or Crew Cab (what is pictured); I like the look better and I wanted more room in the bed of the truck.

I was treated really well at the Nissan dealership, they worked with me to get the right price, and within a day, I had my new truck.  I love it. I'm only 5'2&quot;, so it's a nice rush to climb up into my truck and feel like I could plow down the rest of the cars. Roar!

I highly recommend the Frontier.  It's a great truck for an even better price.<br><br>
