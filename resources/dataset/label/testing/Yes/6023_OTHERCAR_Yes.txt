            It's been about a dozen years since General Motors wrestled itself from the twin grasps of Detroit and the UAW to build their first Saturns in Tennessee. From the get-go, the Saturn line was innovative: consider, for instance, the dealers' no-haggle pricing policy, not to mention an owner-relations program complete with annual "reunions" and C/W concerts. Then, too, the vehicles themselves represented a departure from classic GM output, especially the non-metallic body panels; not to mention quality of construction that was intended to rival that of European and Asian competitors, and pretty much succeeded.

Saturn owners have proven themselves downright fanatically loyal. Perhaps it's the pricing, maybe it's being treated like a human being by the dealers (especially their service departments); it could be Faith Hill - who knows? In fact, it might be the cars themselves - the original S-series coupes and sedans, although not the most attractive in the world, have endeared themselves to their owners much in same manner as the classic VW Beetle. 

After a ten-year run competing with the likes of the Corolla, Civic, Escort, and Neon on a fairly even footing, the brass at Saturn decided to step up the competition a notch. So in 2000, the company rolled out its new "L" series (L, they told us, means "large"), aimed pointblank at the family sedan market. The L-series thus goes head-to-head with the Maxima, the Camry, the Accord, the Galant, and the Taurus, among others. 

They compete, to be certain, but the big question is, do they win? On the economic front, it's a simple equation: a Saturn L costs from $700 to $3000 less than a comparably equipped Accord or Camry (<i>per</i> Saturn's website); it is price-competitive with the Taurus and Sable. On other fronts, though, Saturn may not fare so well: it seems that the old saw "you get what you pay for" may still be alive and kicking in the auto market. 


<b>A Week in a Saturn L200</b>

Last week, I rented a Saturn L200 for that by now wearying weekly business trip: four days, 400 miles. Enterprise supplied the four-door sedan with the stock 4-cylinder engine, but had upgraded(?) it with an automatic transmission (a five-speed manual is standard). Though no two-door is available, Saturn does offer the L200 and L300 in one of the few remaining station wagon bodies. The usual amenities were in place for a family sedan: cruise, tilt, power windows/(heated) mirrors/locks, and remote keyless entry plus alarm. Other creature comforts included A/C (definitely not optional in Texas!) and an AM/FM/Single CD player (no cassette).

The exterior design is decidedly middle-of-the road, except for an integral spoiler on the trunk lid the car could be mistaken at first glance for just about any mid-size Japanese sedan. The famed polymer panels (they eschew the more generic "plastic" at Saturn) don't look different from a distance, but up close prove more widely separated than the sheet metal most of us are used to. The interior is intrinsically middle-of-the-road, though the L200 comes with a pair of walnut-grain panel surrounds, one on the dashboard and the other on the console. Most interior design differences from competing vehicles seem to be mainly in the size and placement of controls. 


<b>Car-to-Driver Interface</b>

As in most small family sedans, the driving position is low (relative to an SUV or pickup) and extended. The front bucket seats are fairly comfortable, though they lack much in the way of support, especially in the lumbar region. Besides front-back slide and seatback recline, Saturn also gives the driver a manual seat-height adjustment. This adjustment seems restricted to a relatively narrow range. 

The cockpit is narrow: the Saturn's body is two inches thinner than an Accord and Camry; five inches narrower than Taurus. A small, padded flip-top compartment sits far to the rear, twin cup holders are molded into the console at the driver's hip, forcing the parking brake handle up against the passenger seat. Knobs and switches are arranged in an unusual manner; perhaps the strangest decision is the distribution of the four power window switches about the shifter on the console. 

From left to right, a driver finds:
* Power mirror switch high and forward on the driver's door
* Trunk release
* Instrument panel and dome light switch, lower-left dashboard
* Instrument panel: tachometer/speedo-odo-trip/fuel plus idiot lights
* Dashboard center, top-to-bottom: lots of blank switches and the hazard lights, sound system, and climate control

The headlamp controls (including dimmer) are on the turn-signal switch on the steering column, and the windshield washer/wiper controls on a right-hand stalk. The latter has two speeds plus a three-speed intermittent setting. Cruise controls are located on the face of the steering wheel; the on-off switch is lighted but there is no "Cancel" switch.


<b>Driver-to-Road Interface</b>

The stock 2.2-liter four develops 135 horsepower (20hp lower than Accord, Camry, and the standard Taurus V6). This relative lack of power is fairly obvious in acceleration tests, especially from fifty MPH plus, where the L200's acceleration is rather lackadaisical. Saturn's 3L, 182hp V6 is standard in the L300 trim line but is unavailable in L100 or L200.

EPA mileage estimates are 33/28 MPG, almost exactly the same as the Honda and Toyota fours; significantly better than the Taurus V6. In my week of mostly highway driving, I averaged just below 31 MPG, a quite acceptable fuel economy. 

The vehicle I drove displayed a persistent hiccough on acceleration; the car had only 10K miles on it so was not due for maintenance. 

I found handling to be lackluster: steering response was not as crisp or sharp as might be expected for a small, light car, I found the vehicle to have a tendency to wander in the lane at freeway speeds. Maneuverability is fairly good, with a turning circle of about 36.5 feet (comparable to Accord; smaller than Taurus). Front-end dips during hard braking were common, though body sway in turns did not seem pronounced. The overall ride is coarse and jittery, though the suspension damps moderate bumps fairly well. 

Engine noise is relatively minor except under acceleration when the sound rises to a fever pitch. Road noise is comparable to other cars in its class, but the wind noise is quite pronounced.  


<b>Amenities</b>

Storage in the passenger compartment is about average: the glove box has a small cross-section but is surprisingly deep. There are map pockets in both doors and a fabric pocket on the back of the passenger seat. Console storage is restricted; there's room for half a dozen CDs with a few other items. There are two cup holders in the console for the front, and two in a fold-down armrest for the rear seats. One 12-volt power port in the dashboard doubles as lighter, there's a second at the rear of the console.

The rear seats split 60:40 to fold down with easily accessible releases. The trunk can be opened remotely from the driver's seat or the key fob; a valet switch built into the lock disables both remotes. There are sliding switches on the trunk side of the back seats to disable seatback folding as well.

Front seating is relatively comfortable; rear seating is less so. Foot and leg room are sufficiently small to render the back seat fairly useless for adults; it will - I presume - suffice for children. 

The stock sound system is average or better, though the lack of a cassette deck may give pause to commuters addicted to books on tape. Controls for the sound system are (like many other controls in the car) of fairly poor and non-intuitive design. The volume control in particular was poor: about 60% of the volume range was covered by about five degrees of arc, making adjustment rather touchy. The radio face is also, frankly, quite unattractive.


<b>Safety Features</b>

Dual front airbags are standard in the L200, as are traction control and an anti-lock braking system (ABS). Unlike many cars in its class, the L200 sports five shoulder belts, including an integral belt for the rear-seat center. Child safety locks (rear door) are standard, as is the remote keyless entry with panic button. Like all GM cars, the Saturn has daytime running lamps. An idiot light on the dashboard is intended to remind you to turn on the headlamps. Child safety-seat LATCH points are built into the rear seat and deck.


<b>Built For Munchkins?</b>

Although I'm an average-sized adult male (5-11, 185), I found the interior of the L200 quite cramped. It's not that I demand a large space: I'm quite comfortable driving my Accord. My claustrophobic feelings in the L200 were partially due to the amount of space available, but - I think - due as much to the location of switches and controls. For instance, one need almost be a contortionist to reach the driver's side window switch where it's crammed in between the shifter and the seat. The console compartment is far to the rear, almost out of reach for a driver my size - it would be almost inaccessible for drivers who sit far forward. 

The mirror control is in a reasonable location, but is mounted at an abnormally high angle that makes it difficult to operate. The parking brake is on the opposite side of the cup holders, making access difficult when you've been drinking your Diet Pepsi on the way to work. Switches are oddly -shaped or- sized, for instance the left-right toggle on the mirror control is perhaps 3/16" wide and 3/8" long, and it lacks a neutral position. 

Control deficiencies appear throughout the Saturn: headlight and wiper switches are smooth, bulbous knobs, with an intermittent wiper control that's difficult to grasp and turn, having but one small projection to improve the grip. Controls in the trunk for the seatback and remote lockout are flimsy; the parking brake is likewise small and of weak materials. A four-position fan speed control is a clunky, chunky, flat edge-on disk; it's not only at odds with the other controls in the cluster, but is also unlit and has poor ergonomics. 


<b>Evaluation: the <i>Good</i>, the <i>Bad</i>, and the <i>Indifferent</i></b>

Based on the driving experience and comparisons to other cars in its class I've driven recently, here's my take on the points of the Saturn L200:

<i>The Good </i>: Strong selling points.
+ Fuel economy
+ Safety features
+ Standard amenities (for the price)

<i>The Indifferent</i>: What's different from the competitors?
= Handling and maneuverability
= Ride
= Engine power
= Seating comfort, front and rear
= Trunk and storage
= Sound system and climate control
= Styling


<i>The Bad </i>: Things the salesman doesn't mention
- Wind and engine noise
- Control placement, sizing, and ergonomics
- Component quality and manufacture
- Cramped front and rear space


<b>Recommendations</b>

One of the most oft-stated deficiencies of the Saturn line is their small dealer and repair network; if you're quite close to one (and expect to stay there), a Saturn L may work out for you. So what, though, if it's less expensive than a Camry or Accord: it's not as well-designed or constructed, and it's also more cramped. Saturn has a much better reputation, though, than Hyudai, Kia, or Daewoo; so factor that into your buying equation. And remember, this is not a car designed for big people.
