            I purchased my camera at Office Max.  I have been amazed at the potential of this camera.  It came with an 8 meg disk and I can store up to 80 pictures at a time.

Photo quality is excellent and the camera is very easy to use.  I especially like the fact that there is a large LCD display on the rear of the camera where you can line up the picture and see what you get as soon as you click.  That way, sometimes the lighting might be bad or the subject might have blinked or for whatever reason, you immediately see what you got in the picture.  That way, if it is a bad picture, you can re-shoot, erase it, or just let it go if it's a good shot.

There is a 2x digital zoom feature that is okay, but a 6x zoom would be better.

My only real dislike of this camera is the fact that battery life is minimal.  If you use the LCD display very much, you can forget those expensive batteries.  I would recommend a set or 4 of rechargeable batteries for this camera, but it does come with an AC adapter for shooting in or around an area where there is an outlet.

I would also recommend a 12 volt adapter for the car or boat.

Included software is fantastic!  Easy to use, and a lot of fun when I morphed pics of my family and then e-mailed them to some friends in Indiana!<br><br>
