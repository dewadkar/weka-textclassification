            Nikon Coolpix 990


This camera is the next in the Nikon family.  It has fixed the primary problems with the coolpix 950.  The problems with the 950 are:

No USB port
Slow capture speeds
Camera has to be removed off of a tripod to change compact flash cards
Major red-eye problem

All of these problems have been fixed with the coolpix 990.  The charcoal gray color is really appealing, but I like coolpix 950's color better.  The Sony 3.34 megapixel CCD can really push out some impressive pictures.  The main feature I like about it is that I can crop a picture, print an 8x10, and not have any &quot;pixelation&quot;.

Overall:

   Nikon did a good job in fixing the problems on the 950, but I am glad that they overall made minor changes.  The 950 was already an awsome tool, and if you can afford the $999 MSRP, then you are homefree.  

My advice:

    If you have a 950, sell it on ebay as soon as possible.  If you wait to sell your 950, the price for them will drop significantly in April, when the 990 is offically released.  Be careful about preordering a 990 on a web site, because you might not see it for a while, as what happened with the 950 when it was released.  <br><br>
