            I would recommend before anyone dies, they need to one at least one "real" sports car.  No sorry a mustang GT does not count fellas.  This car is the real macoy!!! It is VERY fast and it will suprise you how fast the car is.  It does not sound that great (does not have an indy car sound).  In fact it sounds more like a UPS truck.  The looks of the car are OUTSTANDING!! You will get LOTS of attention with this car.  If you are not a person that like attention I would recommend getting a C5 Corvette.  The Viper is also not a practical car.  The car does not lock, the car does not have windows and you cannot drive this car in the rain.  You need to have good weather, so you really should live in a state with some sunshine.  I wouldn't even think of getting a Viper without a service contract.  YOU NEED ONE!! Vipers are not cheap to fix, and I promise you will have a couple minor problems that will amount to about 500 bucks a pop (or more)!!  Sleep better at night and get one!! I would also strongly recommend getting a hardtop and windows so you can used the car on a cold fall day or not have to worry about getting it caught in some rain.  One other pain with the car is you MUST have it valet parked.  You can't simply park the car in a parking lot, because people with ding your beauty.  Overall this car is far from practical, but you can't say you lived life without owning one!!
