            Its just a great, reliable little car.  We commute 600 miles a week and have 115,000+ miles on this four year old car and she's still running strong.  In all those miles, we've only spent about $1500 in maintenance on her!  We tried to run her out of oil on a trip to Canada, keep forgetting to get the oil changed, don't get her washed enough, but she still keeps going.  Very comfortable, even for 2 larger people in front.  Run medium-grade gasoline in her and she's very peppy on the highway too!  Even with all those miles, our Escort still averages 30 MPG with an even mix of highway travel and in-town traffic!  We'd definitely buy an Escort again and plan to stick with Fords in general in the future.<br><br>
