            I just bought this camera a week ago, and the early returns on it are good.  Kodak had a nice quick start guide poster that gets you going immediately.  Took me about 20 minutes to take some pictures and transfer them to my pc.  That's including going through some of the basic menu function settings; like deleting shots, using the 2x zoom.

The colors are truly something. Vibrant and clear.

This is a great starter camera.  My main use is for e-mails and storing photos on my hard drive.  I thought of going the more expensive route, but after reading favorable reviews for this camera I was sold.  I paid $170, plus there's a $30 rebate.  Under $150 is a steal!  Why pay over $300 for 2-3 megapixel cameras now?  If and when I decide to upgrade in a year or so the prices of the higher pixel cameras will probably be under $300.

Yes, the 2 mb of internal memory is low, and there is no USB support.  That can be remedied w/ the picture card reader ($30) and flash card memory, $40-$50 for 32 mb.  

No lens cap included but one can be obtained free from Kodak upon request, which I did when I registered the camera at their website.   

If you're looking for a camera for e-mail and personal use this is more than adequate.  Besides, for e-mail it's really better to send photos with a lower pixel count.  2 megapixels or more is overkill.

Another small feature I like is that it uses AA batteries; which in the long run can be much cheaper than specific camera batteries.  You can use regular alkaline or the new nickel metal halide rechargeables.
