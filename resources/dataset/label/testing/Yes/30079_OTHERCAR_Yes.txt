            I use this camera at work to take pictures of various activities and functions.  It performs wonderfully and is a breeze to use.  Connection to the computer via USB cable is a snap. I am highly impressed with the quality of the images that come off of this camera.  The only problem I find with it is that it eats up batteries rather quickly.  I use rechargeable batteries mainly but I have found that the new Energizer Titanium batteries last a for a good deal of time in this camera.  This camera produces the best quality image when in the "BEST" mode.  If you plan to put pictures on a webpage or if you plan to e-mail the pictures, a lower resolution setting will suit you.  

Some of the pictures I take with the camera end up in our agency newspaper, and they print quite well.  I was surprised by how well the pictures printed in the newspaper.  A good deal of the pictures I take with the camera get put on our agency website and look fantastic when converted to .gif format.

I highly recommend this camera, for its ease of use and for its outstanding image quality.
