            I got my 1991 Dodge Shadow in February of 2001 and it is my first car.  And now, 5 months later, I have come to love it already. I bought the "America" model which is the, I guess you could say, economic model. All in all it has an airbag but no AC.  I guess that's a decent trade-off in terms of safety.  But that's my only mechanical complaint.  It runs great and has a bit under 100,000 miles on it. I recently had to replace the alternator and some hoses but i guess that comes with a 10 year car that was previously owned by a driving school!  I am constantly surprised about how well it runs because Shadows have always been known as low performance economical cars.  Not many people expect them to run well after 10 years.  But this does and I love it.  So I'm not too keen to all the specification lingo so I'm not sure how to say how good the fuel economy is other than that filling the tank is cheap and it lasts a long time! The interior is comfortable for a cheap car. and there is alot of room in the trunk for whatever.  I can fit 3 hockey equipment bags (and those are big bags) in there easily.  When I bought this car i expected a piece of garbage that would fall apart after a month, espescially since the price was under $2000.  But t runs great and it comfortable.  It perfomrs well for a 4 cylinder engine and needless to say you shouldnt expect much performance from this car unless you can find the turbo model they made of the Sahdow.  If you are looking for a first can that a new driver (like me) can get used to and it easy to drive.  If you are looking for a high performance, luxurious car this is obviously not for you.  Also one last warning: you may experience paint chipping but it's not too much of an eyesore.  i really like it now that I touched up the paint job and put a new stereo in it.  So all in all I really like this car for what it is, an economical, average looking and average performing car.
