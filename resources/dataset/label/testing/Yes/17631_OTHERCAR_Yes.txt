            Well, first off, I have not bought one of these vehicles. But I have taken a few test drives in them, and instantly fell in love with them. I have owned and driven a few Saturn SL's in the past several years, so that's what I have to compare them to.

The Saturn SC is a sports coupe (get it? SC=sports coupe!!) with three doors. It's lines are very sleek, and its shape is very similar to a lot of its peers in the sensible sports car field. I mean, come on, it's not a Porsche--it is a Saturn after all--but what that means is that it is a workhorse of a vehicle that also happens to look sporty and sassy all at the same time.

I was a bit skeptical about the space in the backseat with the three door thing. But once I got in the back seat and road around for a while in it, I realized it has almost as much space back there as the Saturn SL does. Plus there's a nifty little cup holder in between the two back seats. The only criticism I would have of the back seat area is that the seatbacks are very vertical, and I imagine on a longer road trip that would not be very comfortable for an adult (maybe it wouldn't bother kids). There's also a lot less leg room than the 4 door SL's.

Both back seats fold down, just like the SL, and the trunk space is just as huge (dead body sized, the sales guys as Saturn like to say). I don't know the details about the SC's engine, but it drives pretty similarly to the SL, except it has power rack and pinion steering (SL's come without power steering--ugh).

Overall, the SC is a narrower car on the road, allowing for better handling. It just doesn't feel as big of a car, and it's certainly not as boxy, so things like parallel parking are not as difficult in an SC. I don't remember the technical details about the engine, but it had pretty decent pickup and didn't sound quite as loud of an engine as most Saturns. And the price, well you just can't beat the price of approx. $15K for a groovy little sportscar!!

SC's come with options for a sunroof, fun colors like blue and yellow (unfortunately they are discontinuing blackberry for the 2001 line), and a CD/cassette combo sound system (for those who want ALL of their sound media options covered).

In general, I would recommend this car to anyone who loves Saturn's reliability and sensibility as a car, but wants to feel a little hipper and sportier. They really look great, and the third door access to the backseat maintains the trademark Saturn stamp of sensibility, versatility, and utility.

The busy mother of four might not find an SC to be the ideal car, but a college student, club kid, beachbunny, or anyone going through a midlife crisis just might.<br><br>
