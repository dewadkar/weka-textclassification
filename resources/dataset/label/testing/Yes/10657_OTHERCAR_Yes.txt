            I very much enjoy my voyager. It has a lot of space we always take it on trips and not even once yet has there been a time when we needed to put anything on the roof we have used it for many things whether it is cargo or passengers we always have plenty of room. I personally have sat in every single seat in the van and I felt very comfortable in all of them we have installed a five disc CD changer and it is made by chrysler and it works great with it. The sound is very nice. I enjoy classical music from it. It is a pretty good car for the winter although once in a while the car will slip. But, overall I think this van was a pretty good buy for the price and the comfort.<br><br>
