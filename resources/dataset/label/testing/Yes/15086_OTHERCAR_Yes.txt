            The reason I bought this car is because of the way it looked.  I just loved the way it looked, I had never seen any thing before like it.  I have put over 40,000 miles in almost three years and I have never had a problem with it yet.  The little 4 cyl engine could use a little help, it seems under powered at times.  I live in Michigan and the 4WD comes in very handy during the winter. Granted it's not a great big SUV, but it handles the snow just fine for me. This car is great if you are single.
Ok roominess up front, NO backseat.UPDATE....I got rid of my suzuki. I needed somethig bigger. This car sure was a BLAST to drive.
