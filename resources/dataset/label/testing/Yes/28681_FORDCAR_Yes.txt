               I guess we all have different experiences with our autos.  But of all the cars I have ever owned, Ford products work well for me.  In 1966, my Father bought me a Mustang and it brought great service.  In 1970 my husband bought a Ford econoline van and if ever there was a work horse, the van was IT!  After years of service, we retired it and bought an 1989 Ford Econoline Conversion Van and we were extremely happy with it.  The we bought a Cadillac, a Porsche, and various foreign cars which we have spent a fortune on and never had the kind of service our Fords have given us.
   I wish I could spell out all of the technical reasons I like a Ford, but I don't know a distributor cap from a spark plug!  What I do know, is that I haven't had to spend a lot of money on my Fords and so I have never had to learn a lot of shop talk lingo.  To tell you the truth, I wasn't very good at getting the oil changed regularly in them.
  I will say this, my Cadillac and the Nissan I drive have aluminum engines.  I don't know why they have become so popular because they tend to overheat a lot as the car ages.  My Father drove Cadillacs for years, and when I bought one, I expected to do the same.  But I wasn't too happy with the performance of the car and I was livid when the paint popped off the hood.  Many mechanics told me that was a problem with GM products and I understand it shouldn't be a problem with the newer cars, but GM refused to do anything about it although they knew there was a problem with the paint.
   I'm looking at new cars and I can almost promise, my next one will be a Ford Van.<br><br>
