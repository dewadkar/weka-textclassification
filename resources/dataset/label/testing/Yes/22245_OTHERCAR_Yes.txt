            The BMW Z3 comes in two engine classes.  Both are in-line 6 cylinders but one has a 2.3L displacement while the other has a 2.8L.  Horsepower is increased by aprox. 30-40 horses (I don't remember the exact figure) but acceleration is only increased by 0.4s between the 2.3 and 2.8L engines.  Of coarse the faster being the 2.8L but with an increase in price of about 10,000CND, is the 2.8 really worth the money.  Sure you are getting a more performance oriented car but keep in mind that both cars are basically exactly the same except for the engine (minus a few interior options which come standard on the 2.8 but needs to be added on the 2.3). They both share the same suspension and framework.  Now, if you are really a performance buff why go for the 2.8 then, people like those should go straight up to the Z M3 Roadster.  That's why I believe that if you want to look cool and style around the city, but are not too concerned about having the quickest car around, then the Z3 2.3 is for you.  But if performance is a key factor in your book then go up to the Z M3, don't just waste 10 grand on the 2.8 when the real performance is somewhere else.  2.8L Z3 is not a good buy compared with the 2.3L.  That's my opinion!<br><br>
