            After ten years of owning Toyota 4Runners 4x4, the high cost of insurance, the low gas mileage, and the sticker shock for a new 4Runner took its toll.   Looking at the number of  times I actually used the 4L range of the 4Runner in the past ten years ( I could count them with the fingers on one hand), and honestly answering the question &quot;was I *really* going to take a new $30,000+ vehicle into a completely off road situation?&quot; , I said there has to be a better alternative.    The Subaru Forester was the answer- lower insurance rates, good gas mileage, 4 wheel drive at a price that still left money in the wallet!

The 2001 Subaru Forester S is extremely well appointed, meaning that you get every comfort feature that a 4 Runner Limited or a Nissan Pathfinder has for about $10,000 less. I love the performance, and in both the suburban driving I do during the week to earn my keep and my weekend expeditions, it outperforms the 4 Runner.  The performance of the AWD system, as compared to the 4H of a 4x4, is remarkable.  Quick smooth acceleration and tight tracking in the curves with no sway gives one the feeling of having a performance sports car (okay, so it is NOT a Porsche :-)) while still having the benefits of a SUV.     Ground clearance is about the same as a 4Runner, and skid plates are available as an option if one is going to take the vehicle off road, though I personally wouldn't want to try it.  The 2.5L  H4 engine actually puts out more HP than the 3.0 L V6 3 L in my old 4Runner.  All around visibility in the vehicle is great- better than the 4 Runner .  However this is a compact SUV- meaning that you don't have the same &quot;height&quot; as  the &quot;big boys&quot;.  

In spite of her smaller size, the Forester still has great storage space.  I can still fit  two sailbags with sails, lifejackets, and all of the other assorted  sailing gear into the cargo compartment and be able to pull the cargo cover over. The cargo bay also came with a plastic insert covering the carpet- a definite plus when one is loading messy items.  It also seems that every other nook and cranny in the rest of the vehicle that possibly could be used for storage is.  When it comes to the cup holders though, heaven only knows what the Subaru engineers were thinking.  Words can not begin to describe their inadequacy.   

The Forester's rated towing capacity is limited- 2000 pounds with a Class 1 hitch.  While more than adequate for my small sailboat ( see my review of the Flying Scot :-) ), if you need to tow a large object, then look else where.   

In all, the Forester is the ideal vehicle for the person who wants to combine the comfort of an auto, with the practical aspects of an SUV., in a safe affordable package.  It's easy to understand why this car has been a Consumers Digest best buy for *5* consecutive years!
