            Since our old car needed major work, we decided to buy a new one. I've always wanted a Saturn, having heard of its great safety features. The experience of buying this car was wonderful - no haggling over the price because the Saturns are one-price for everyone. I once bought a Toyota and dealing with the salesman was agony. However, I walked (actually drove) away from this showroom after buying this car feeling really good about my purchasing experience.  It was actually pleasurable!  Saturn was running a financing program that has enabled my payments to be very low - almost half of what my friend's 99 Corolla is.  As for the performance of the car, I am very pleased with it.  It doesn't &quot;nosedive&quot; when I hit brakes like my old car.  It has a smooth ride and the steering is sharp.  There is a little bit of wind and engine noise, but, hey, I didn't buy an Infinity.  True, it's a little cramped in the back seat, but it is a compact car.  
Also, I want to mention that my insurance has only increased $88.00 a year from my premium for my 93 Ford Escort, with the same coverage. 
Overall, I am extremely happy with the entire experience of buying and owning this car.
