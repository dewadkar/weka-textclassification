            I purchased the FD-73 after looking around for several weeks.  I selected this model for four reasons.
1. Priced under $450.
2. Cheap &quot;memory cards&quot; - 3-1/2&quot; floppy disks that cost 13 to 35 cents each.
3. 10X optical zoom. 20X with SONY's focal length doubler.
4. The money I don't spend on film and processing will more than pay for the camera.
With the 20X zoom I can take the same resolution picture or better than a 1280 x 960 pixel camera with 2X or 3X optical zoom.   I like the different program features that allow control over focus and shutter speed.  The built in flash can be adjusted for brightness and can be turned off.  The fluorescent backlight for the display can be turned off to extend the battery life.  The picture and disk copy features allow me to instantly give others copies of the pictures for their use.  The PC format disc with standard JPEG files is readable by most any PC photo application and by any Macintosh with the ability to read a PC formatted floppy. (All of my Macs can do this.)
The main shortcoming is poor to no view in low light levels and poor focusing in low light levels.  The picture content must be estimated and the manual focusing feature must be used.  The flash is only good for a short distance.   For night shots an inexpensive floodlight can give a pretty good picture for subjects that are reasonably close.
Overall - I say the FD-73 is the best buy for the price.  I plan to be using the FD-73 for a long time.<br><br>
