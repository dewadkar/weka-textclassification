            Never in my life had I even heard of a CRX when I went to look at the automobile.  All I knew of the car was the nice price of $2,000 and it was a Honda.  Any Honda driver will rant and rave about their wonderful quality and long-lasting life with few problems, so when I went to see the car I had a good intention to buy it.

The first thing I thought when I saw the car was, &quot;Man: this looks like something a high school cheerleader would drive,&quot; and being a male high school student with a burning desire to graduate, I wasn't turned on by its looks.  Nevertheless, I am not one to judge a book by its cover and I'm glad I'm not.

First off, I'm a stick driver.  If it's not a manual transmission, I won't buy it.  I learned on a stick and so help me I'll die driving one.  And when I saw my future CRX was a stick-shift, I was ready to buy it then and there.  Still, I took it for a test drive, and after which, I bought the car.

Two years later, the car is running fine without any problems beyond maintenance (new clutch and a replaced catalytic converter).  This car certainly lives up to the Honda name and stands out in my mind as one of the best cars available.  The CRX is a smaller version of the Honda Civic, being only a two-seater.  But where it lacks in human space, it certainly makes up in trunk space.  Many of my friends have it in their minds that my car cannot hold much in the back.  I have to remind them that all my car is missing are back seats.  The Honda CRX has just as much trunk space as any other Honda (hatchback or not), and with more leg room.

Unfortunately, the amount of leg room proved to be a problem in the past.  I am six feet tall, so I don't have a problem with it.  But when my close friend - who I believe stands just below five-feet tall - tried driving my car, she had a hard time fully-engaging the clutch because she could not push it all the way to the back.  Even with the seat entirely forward, her feet would not touch the far end of the floorboard.  This is indeed a disturbing problem.

Besides that minor inconvenience, the CRX offers another problem, with more potential danger.  The car is a death-trap.  I learned this when I was walking through a wrecking yard looking for new fuses.  I'd been attempting to install my new stereo the entire evening and had to sacrifice the horn fuse so my headlights would work after having blown every other replacement fuse I had (I'm not good with electronics, to put it lightly).  So walking through the wrecking yard, I found the a section of Hondas, and two CRX's.

This is a testament to the CRX: the only way they would end up in a wrecking yard is if they were messed up in an accident.  The CRX doesn't &quot;just die&quot;: it has to be killed in order to be undriveable.  But looking at the cars, I could tell that if I ever wreck my baby, either one of us may not survive in one piece.  The CRX is not the safest automobile in the world, but that should not be major consideration.  In that I mean, one should not &quot;assume&quot; they are going to trash their car.

But the leg room issue and results of wrecking aside, there is no problem with the CRX.  It is the smallest car I know of which means the driver must be more alert to blind spots and puddles (especially on the freeway), but a good driver will do that anyway, despite what car they are driving.  This car is perfect for the high school or college student who can scrape by with only two seats and doesn't have much money for gas.  Getting roughly forty miles to the gallon, my CRX is definitely a rice burner.

Cheap quality and affordable driving.  Who could ask for anything more? (Oh, wait: that's Toyota's old slogan.  Oops. ;-)  Still, this car is a best buy in my book and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to buy their first car.  But you know what's funny, though?  I'd never heard of the CRX before I bought mine but now they are everywhere.  Isn't that strange?<br><br>
