              In January of 2001, I purchased my first car, the Acura Integra.  It was the car of my dreams; it was fast, compact, & so unbelievably reliable.  After having this car as my pride and joy for about a year & 1/2, I decided I wanted something a little newer & possibly faster.  I also wanted to upgrade to a standard transmission, seeing as I have a love for driving.  I was so content with Acura (their service, kindness & overall general help), that I decided I couldn't buy anything else.  
  At the time, the RSX was fairly new, being about a year old or so.  I was immediately impressed with its sleek exterior & its size (I'm rather short), that I decided I had to test it out immediately.  I was a little upset that they weren't going to produce the integra anymore, but I figured if they were to replace it, the RSX was the car to do it.  I test drove the type S & fell in love.  It was so easy to drive, seeing as how I had never driven a standard stick shift car before, and I had so much fun doing so.  
  After that, there was no question that I had to have this car.  I worked with the same salesman who had sold me my first car, and got the car for about $26,000, fully loaded.  
  After owning this car for a few months, I can honestly say my depart with the integra was not a difficult one.  The RSX still holds a lot of the same aspects as my previous auto, with the exception of more additions and features, such as the VTEC engine, the stlyish upgraded interior, not to mention its gorgeous.  It handles fabulously & I have never been happier with such a large purchase.
  My car hasn't given me any problems yet; it hasn't been to the shop once, other than for routine oil changes and such.  I feel so incredibly safe in it; all Acuras & Hondas come with iron bars in the doors, which was one outstanding feature I definitely wanted in case I got hit from either side.  It is very lightweight & has great pickup.  It has about 200 horsepower; not too fast, but fast enough to enjoy.  The front of the interior isn't too roomy, and I can see how some people may object to that, but it is just the right size for me.  The back has more room than my previous car, which adds to the comfort level.  The trunk is much roomier than before.  And the car comes with a special edition Bose speaker system; it sounded nice, but I wanted a lot more bass & added a subwoofer, etc. 
  Overall, this car exceeded my expectations and more.  I am thinking about upgrading it in the Spring, simply because they are releasing the Type FS, which has more stock features such as a body kit, rims, spoiler & a few other things. I would recommend this car, from base model to top, to anyone who likes driving sleek, small compact cars.  It is extremely reliable & I love it.  Acura has impressed me yet again.
