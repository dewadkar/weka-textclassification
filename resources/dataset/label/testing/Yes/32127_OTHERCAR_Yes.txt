                 I was an owner of a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, and loved it for many reasons.  I recently started working in the Denver Tech Center, and live up north in Brighton CO (about 100 mi round trip!).  I was looking for something more economical, as the monthly gas bill was HUGE!!!  I started to look into all the econo-box options that I could think of, and I compared many vehicles, and ultimately decided that I wanted to test drive the Lanos sedan.  Similar vehicles included the Hyundai Accent, and the Toyota ECHO.  While those two were rated fairly well, I found a great deal of positive feedback from Daewoo owners.  
     I went to my nearest Daewoo dealership and took a look around at the different models available.  At first glance, I thought &quot;this is the one I want&quot;.  I have owned over 6 different new vehicles in the past 7 years, ranging from trucks to sedans from Toyota, Saturn, Pontiac, Chevy, and Subaru, but I have never seen a car at first glance that I had liked as much as the Lanos sedan. 
     From the initial view, I saw many options that I thought I would have to give up when moving into a smaller, more economical car.  The tires for example, were not little do-nut width tires.  These were quite wide, and low profile, so I could tell that this car could really handle the road!  The alloy wheels were a nice addition, as any car enthusiast knows, the wheels make the entire look of the car come together!  I looked through the window, and saw all the goodies inside that were not even standard on my '97 Grand Am.  Power windows, mirrors, locks, A/C, Tilt wheel, rear defrost, combination CD and cassette (really cool!), 60/40 split rear seat, cup holders, and a trunk that you could fit a small village in!  I am serious, this trunk could fit all the in-laws luggage and then some for a nice trip back to the airport!  
     I finally opened the door and sat down.  I was really surprised at the amount of room this car really has.  From the outside, it looked much smaller that when you were actually in it.  I am 6'1&quot; 230 lbs, and I have about 4-5 inches of headroom, plenty of legroom, and my knees don't hit the center console like they do in the new Ford Escort models! I started the car up and we took the test drive.  I noticed that the engine itself was very quiet, and it was a little difficult getting used to, as I had been driving automatics for years prior.  The clutch has a short throw, as does the gear shift, which is great for running through the gears in a hurry!  The visibility was wonderful in the car.  I couldn't find an area that had &quot;dead spots&quot;, and the rear-view mirror was extra large, making it a &quot;no-strain&quot; driving experience.
     We went on about an 11 mile test drive, including a few side roads, and a major highway (I-25).  The car did fairly well getting from 0-60 with three people in it, but after 60, it took next to nothing to launch it up around 95 mph.  The engine seemed to purr like a kitten at that speed, and even a little faster, but the road noise at that point seemed a little excessive. It is however, a smaller car, and that is to be expected.  The car handled beautifully at all speeds, and really felt solid in the turns.  The doors all close nice and quietly, tightly, and the controls inside all seem to be readily accessible.  The stereo inside sounded great too!  I can crank it up quite loud, and there is little to no distortion or &quot;muddy&quot; sound coming from it.  Overall I think this is an incredibly great little car, that's really not so little!
     The downside of this vehicle is mainly the amount of solid plastic components, including the dash board, the door panels, and the lack of a center console that you can use as an arm rest.  The overall quality of the interior is very good, and functionally well designed.  I would , however, like to see future models come out with full length side guards, as I can forsee a lot of door dings as time goes on.  I am currently own one of the only two 2001 Lanos' in Colorado, and I would definitely advise anyone who is looking at buying a new vehicle to check out all the models in the Daewoo line, and research all the over-sea's models that will be soon following here in this country!  Great cars, I will definitely be purchasing another when the time comes again!<br><br>
