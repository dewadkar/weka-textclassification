            I love my 1997 Dodge Dakota Sport 4X4.  It is equipped with a modified V-8, 318, 5.2L Magnum Engine.  Special mods. include: JET performance module, K&amp;N Air Filtercharger, 1.7:2 Aluminum Roller Rocker Arms, an Accel 300+ Racing Ignition(multispark), and 8.5mm Taylor Vertex PRO SERIES High Performance Spark Plug Wires.  I've also customized the Audio system by replacing one pair of the stock 6 1/2&quot; mid-bass with a pair of eclipse 3-way 6 1/2's.  I've also replaced the head unit with a Pioneer DEH-P200 CD Player and added 3 12&quot; JL Audio subwoofers(powered by a MTX 2150 amplifier).  My truck has gotten me out of many sticky situations.  I've been in mud holes that many of my buddy's(with their chevy and ford 350's) have been stuck in and gotten out and also had to pull them out as well.  Although I am only 17, I would have to say this is probably the most dependable truck on the market today.  The only times my truck has been in the shop was because of my pure stupidity.  This truck has superior handling and a great, comfortable ride.  It has great control and traction with best reaction of any 4X4 I've ever driven.  I highly recommend this truck to everyone.  It is affordable(note I'm only 17 and still in highschool and I have one), gets good MPG, powerful, aggressive, yet very smooth.<br><br>
