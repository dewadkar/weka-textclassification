            I have always wanted to experiment with photography, but didn't want the hassle and expense of developing film.  After checking out E-opinions, Imaging Resource www.imaging-resource.com, and Digital Preview www.dpreview.com, I felt like digital cameras were finally of good enough quality to match film for the average consumer.

I spent many hours reading reviews and opinions, but seeing it in a store and feeling it in my hand was totally different.  I love the size and weight.  It's just solid enough to feel very durable, yet because it's made of plastic, it's pretty light.  Originally, I was thinking of getting a Canon S10 or S100 because of their size, but once I saw the Nikon 880 in the store, I felt like it was plenty small enough.  It's fairly impressive, the number of features packed into something of this size.

I have only had the camera for 2 days now, although I have been experimenting with it heavily.  This is also my first digital camera, so I can't say yet how it compares with others.  I wanted to post a review though, because it might be representative of others who are getting their feet wet into digital cameras, but want/need lots of features.

Picture quality.  The colors seem very accurate.  I felt like the pictures looked just like the real thing.  Close-up shots are awesome.  Very sharp.  However, I had a lot of problems focusing.  A lot of my shots came out slightly blurry.  The best shot selection (BSS) feature works great.  It definitely helped.  However, I still found details missing or blurred in the pictures, which seemed unreasonable.  I took several pictures of distant landscapes and mountains, which seem like would not have a problem with focus, but as soon as I zoomed in on the image on my PC, they looked blurry.  Note that the close-up shots (less than 2 feet) were very sharp, so it's not always bad.  I haven't tried using a tripod too much yet.  However, that would seem to be a shame to have to carry a tripod everywhere just to get decent shots.  How do other people do it?  I also noticed some purple fringes on a few outdoor shots, although it's not terribly noticeable.

Indoor shots have been problematic so far.  I took some random shots around the house at night.  Regular flash didn't seem to be strong enough unless the subject was within 8-10 feet.  I also had some problems with the subject being very bright, while the background was dark, but there is a delayed flash which does a decent job of fixing that.  Several of the pictures also had odd white balance.  Kind of a yellowish color.  I could have probably corrected that by playing with the settings.  At the time I was trying out the full-auto mode and the scene modes.  For the most part, I stopped using them because I wasn't getting good results.

The LCD is excellent, although in bright sunlight, it became almost unusable.  I had heard several people say that, but I assumed it was usable as long as the sun wasn't shining directly on it.  Not true.  In bright sunlight, I had problems seeing the display period, no matter which way I turned.  Not sure any other camera would be much better though.  That was when I started to use the optical viewfinder.  However, I find it very user unfriendly.  Partially because of the camera's size, I couldn't get comfortable using it.  If I used my right eye, my nose (relatively small) would smush into the LCD, leaving smudge marks.  The image through the optical viewfinder is very small and inaccurate.  Maybe it's unavoidable in a camera of this size.

The amount of information available through the LCD on the picture settings is great!  Definitely good for experimentation.  I don't know if other digital cameras do this, but all of the settings are available for each picture through the camera, and also through the image properties once it is on the PC.  There is supposed to be some optional text file to save the settings for each image, but I never had to use that since it seemed to be embedded somehow in the JPEG files already, at least when I used the Nikon software.

Speaking of which, the software seems pretty minimal and a little bit clumsy.  It included an image editing program which was laughable.  Just a few very basic features like contrast and brightness.  The Nikon software to download the images was pretty basic.  I found it annoying that it had no option to turn off confirmation when deleting images from the PC.  I had to answer yes every time.  There was also software to join or stitch images together for panoramics.  However, it required some sort of calibration and I was disappointed that Nikon didn't explicitly support this feature in the camera.  I used a cheap Olympus 1 megapixel camera once that supported panoramic.  Why can't Nikon?

The Nikon 880 does support movies, although it seemed pretty jerky to me.  Especially since the focusing is relatively slow, I am not sure it would be very useful for anything with even moderate action.  Also, there is no sound recorded for the movies.  It would be something nice for a camera in this price range.

Finally, I found a killer negative, which will cause me to return this particular camera: stuck pixels.  I have found a minimal of 4 blocks of stuck pixels, and perhaps a fifth.   Unfortuantely, the pixels are grouped towards the center and very obvious.  Using image editing software, I could see that the center of the problem is only 1-4 pixels square.  However, it seemed to have an effect on an area up to 8 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.  Big problem in my opinion.  I found shareware software called Thumber to get rid of the pixels, but this seems too extreme.  Although many outdoor shots mask the stuck pixels, if I look hard enough, I can usually see at least 3 of them on every picture.  They are usually bright green or bright blue.

In my opinion, it is worth it to pay more at a local retailer to be able to physically see the camera and compare it to others.  I feel like it also makes it easier to evaluate and return the camera if there is problems, as in my case.  I am going to hold on the Nikon 880 a little longer to see if this is the model I am going to stay with.  I looked at the Nikon 990, and liked how comfortable it was despite being quite a big bigger.  At this point, I am thinking that the Nikon 995 may be a better buy.  I think it is about $1000, but at least that includes rechargeables and the ability to use Type II Compact Flash.


<b> Update! </b>
I have since returned the Nikon 880 and purchased a Canon PowerShot G1.  Ironically, I think more highly of the Nikon 880 now that I have been able to compare it to another camera.  However, I decided that the extra features of the Canon offset it's greater weight and size.  Initially, the pictures from Canon were worse than the Nikon.  However, after adjusting the camera's contract, I thought the Canon was slightly better (especially when there was less light) than the Nikon.  Note that purple fringing on the Canon is really bad at times.  See my G1 review for a comparison of these two cameras.
