            I was attracted to the Grand Am GT because I owned a 1990 white Grand am coupe with the ground effects and quad dual exhausts (just like now-ten years later). It had a 2.3 liter Quad 4 with lots of power and a bad rep for the head gaskets blowing. This did happen at about 90000 miles. But, I still loved the car! Said goodbye at 167,000 and it still looked like a brand new car! Ten years later, I own its descendent which is much bigger, better, and faster. I love its looks, engine, engine sound, exhaust note and system, and its lovely interior! I went all out and bought a bright red GT1 with the option package that gives it leather, cassette/CD, and Chrome wheels. Every month when I make my payment, I can say its worth every penny. I could have gotten the much cheaper SE but the GT gives the car a dramatically different air. I love its Ram Air system,(like the Ram Air TransAM). If I didn't have to worry about snow and the such, I would own a Trans AM by the way (rear wheel drive is such a pain when you are trying to climb a snowpacked drive) There are no really significant weaknesses. Maybe if you like a stick, your out of luck. Of course sticks are growing less practical in this stop and go society. I suggest Pontiac offering a Tiptronic shifter, a clutchless manual, like is offered in the new Stratus R/T. And maybe a sunroof that opens a little wider. That's about it!<br><br>
