            I love this cam, it takes great photos, and it's fast. No more pressing shutter only to wait 10 seconds for camera to take pic! Controls are kind of funky, read the manual with this one! Better get some rechargeable batteries too. Get the LITHIUM ones, not the cheapies.
Serial connection, (like most) is slow, so if you are planning on taking lots of pics, invest in a smart media reader. 
The number one wierd thing about this camera is that the lens cover hits the lens when you are closing it if you are not careful. Need to fix that little design problem, but all, this is a GREAT camera in this price range!!
The lens quality is very good, and the LCD screen is handy.
I haven't had a problem with it yet, except remembering to charge up the batteries! 
Also forgot to mention that it works very well for action shots, and also has a feature where you can shoot several frames one right after the other.
