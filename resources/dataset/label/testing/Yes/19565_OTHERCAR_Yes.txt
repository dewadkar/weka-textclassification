               I have never been much happier with a set of wheels than with the '99 Suburban.  It all began with the excellent service I recieved upon first leasing the vehicle; friendly dealer, helpful company, great price.  The colour was also beautiful (a dark burgandy) leaving me with an overall wonderful impression upon first gaining the car.  

    When I got the car onto the road, my happiness only increased.  The stabilty, the firmness, the lack of any discernable rattles or erroneous noises (something I have come to expect upon leasing vehicles) and, most of all, the absolut <i>smoothness</i> of the car (hence the dubbing &quot;The Texas Cadillac&quot;) made such an incredible impression on me I have vowed to continue with the same line of vehicles until some horrible incident causes me to do otherwise (unlikely with what I have seen so far of this car!)

   The only complaint I could make would be concerning the brakes; they are quite weak and needed some tuning before I was satisfied.  The gas milage was fair-good for such a large car, and nothing can quite compare to sitting so dang <b>high</b> up in the air (heh heh, guy thing, I know.)  So if you are in the market for a nice, LARGE set of wheels.... look no further.<br><br>
