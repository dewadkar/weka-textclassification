            My wife and I were headed to Napa with a good friend in our 1990 Jeep Cherokee.  The friend was telling us how pleased he was with a new SUV he had just bought, a Mercedes ML 320.  His enthusiasm got contagious just as we were approaching an off-ramp to a Mercedes dealer.  Believe it or not, we took the exit, went to the dealer, and ordered the ML 430.  We took delivery a year later and have thus far driven it 12,000 miles.  

Having never owned a Mercedes of any sort, we weren't fully prepared for just how good a job they do.  As you would expect, the fit and finish inside and out is flawless, and I guess we expected that.  What I like most about it, though is its engine/transmission combination.  Our other car is a 1994 Corvette with a 300 HP V8, and I can say that the power the 4.3 liter V8 in the 430 delivers doesn't disappoint me in relation to the Corvette.  When you put the accelerator pedal 3/4 the way down it doesn't sound like an atomic attack.  In combination with the engine the 4-speed automatic transmission delivers the smoothest power of any car I have owned.  Entering a freeway onramp you go from 20 MPH to 55 in one smooth interval; it's hard to tell when it shifts.

Just after buying the 430 we trailered our 20 foot SeaRay up to a river about two hours drive away.  I figured we were trailering about 5,000 pounds total, and the 430 did great.  It had plenty of power up the hills and tracked well at 55 MPH.  Unlike the Cherokee, it never over-heated either.  Also, launching the boat on a slippery ramp was no problem because of the all-the-time, all-wheel drive provided excellent traction.<br><br>
