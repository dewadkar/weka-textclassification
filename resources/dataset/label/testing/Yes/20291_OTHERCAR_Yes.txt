            A friend of mine owns a Nissan Sentra, and she constantly lets me drive it.  As a matter of fact, we're going to drive it across the country to Alaska, and I'm sure it will last the entire trip.

I'm a manual kind of guy, and her car is an automatic.  To tell you the truth, this is the &lt;/b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; automatic car that I enjoy driving.  The car handles quite easily and turns on a dime.  The brakes are awesome, but the seatbelts have a little problem.  (They don't snap back into the car when you remove them, leaving them flax and able to get slammed in the door.)

The gas mileage is pretty good, too, getting about 37 miles to the gallon.  It's a cute little car which is also quite comfortable.  It's not at the top of my list, but it certainly isn't at the bottom.<br><br>
