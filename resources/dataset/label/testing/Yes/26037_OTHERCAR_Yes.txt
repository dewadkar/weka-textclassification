            I met the Deep Amethyst Dodge Stratus 1 year before I bought it, and in that time another owner put 25,000 miles on it.  When I walked onto the Used car lot to pick up a cheap Neon, this car 'called my name'.  I'm so glad it did - it flies like the wind, smooth and low on noise, hugs curves and handles straight roads like floating on a cloud - it's name is perfect.  I could use a couple of inches of headroom, but all passengers and driver do have ample leg room, and the compact size and low profile give it that 'hug the road' reeling.  The best lumbar support I've ever found.  This car is big enough for a family, sleek enough for a sports-car driver, and priced below most other cars of its size. I don't recommend it for people who like the big-luxury-car feel, but if you were dreaming of an Intrepid, but want to scale down just one notch, this is your car.<br><br>
