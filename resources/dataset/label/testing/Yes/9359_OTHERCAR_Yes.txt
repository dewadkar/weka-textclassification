            I recently purchased the Olympus C-2500L and have some familiarity with digital cameras.  We all know this is where photography is going, so you might as well get on board.  This camera is the cutting edge today.  It's expensive, prices will come down, but this camera gives you a 5x7 picture that is indistinguishable from a 35 mm print (I could tell a difference at 8x10 size).  This camera has a real zoom lens, most digitals do not.  It offers two forms of memory storage: Smartmedia and CompactFlash and has a great versatile flash unit.  On the down side, the viewfinder gives you less than what is actually stored (I'm guessing 80-90%), so you have to make some mental adjustments.  The controls are great and very easy to use.  In short, it gives you all the promises of digital, real photographic control in your own home.  Tell all your friends with computers - digital has arrived and this is the first camera worth the jump!<br><br>
