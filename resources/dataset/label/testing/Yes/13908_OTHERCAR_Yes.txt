            In 1994, i bough my first Saturn, an SC1 aqua coupe. For seven years, my Saturn never gave me any major problems, just regular maintenance (that means far less maintenance in seven years with the Saturn than with my parents 1997 Toyota Camry). So after 200 000 kilometers on my SC1, i bought a 2001 gold SL2 in a nearby Saturn dealer (Montreal, Canada).  The gas mileage is very good and the car handling is far better than the 2001 Honda civic i test drove before buying the Saturn (i also compared it to the Focus, the Corolla, the Cavalier and the Neon). 

Overall great value for the price, extremely reliable, spacious, sporty handling and good gas mileage. If these technical aspects are not enough to convince you, the quality customer service along  with the no pressure sales practice will. At the Honda dealer, i felt like a prey or a walking dollar bill and nothing more. At Saturn, they even suggested me to take a moment to think it over and than come back for a second test drive in order to make the best decision.
    
On my SL2, i chose the most complete package (including cruise control, power locks, power windows and security system).  The engine  performs smoothly even in our Canadian winter mornings. The plastic body panels are features that Saturn should always keep, they made my 1994 SC1 look like new when i sold it. The resale value is also very good.
