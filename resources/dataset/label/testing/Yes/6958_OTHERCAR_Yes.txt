            Having owned an SUV from the Big 3 automakers, I have found the 
Chevrolet Blazer to be the best.  I tried out all the others, Durango,
Explorer, Mountaineer,and found that for the money, dollar for dollar,
the Blazer had the best of both worlds, ie: value &amp; what I was looking
for.  The vehicle drives like a cross between a car and a truck, has the
durability of a truck with a little more carrying capacity that a car.
With the trailer towing package, I am able to haul my good size boat
with ease.  Everything on the vehicle for controls is conveniently
located and does not put the driver in an awkward position to change
anything.  The six way power seat is perfect and can be adjusted for
anyone's personal preference.  Gas mileage is better than expected with
it achieving about 20 to 23 mpg on the highway and 17-18 intown.  
The Ford explorer and the Mercury Mountaineer only gets about 18-19 on the highway.  I tried these all from a rental agency before finally 
deciding on the Blazer.  
The sound system in the Blazer is adequate and better than Dodge's. 
It is a legitimate 5 person vehicle although somewhat crowded with 3
people in the back.  For the price, you can not go wrong.
