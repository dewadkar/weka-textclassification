            In 1990 my parents purchased a new 1991 Sunbird with the V6 engine and automatic transmission.  It has been a wonderful car.  They drove it for five years, and then it was given to me for college.  I have 127,000 miles on the car, and have had very few problems.  The alternator has been replaced twice, but I think it was replaced the second time because the first alternator had problems, not the car.  

At around 100,000 miles I did have a small oil leak, but it was easily fixed with a new set of valve cover gaskets.  I get 27-29 mpg on the highway and around 20-22 mpg in town which is excellent for a V6 with this many miles.  The car has excellent acceleration, tight steering, and easy to read gauges.  There are real gauges for oil pressure, charge, and temperature, and not just idiot lights.  

Aside from typical maintenance such as regular oil changes,  brake pads, and a tune up, the car has needed little.  The valve cover gaskets were replaced, the alternator has been replaced, and the fuel pump was replaced at around 110,000 miles.

The car has lots of trunk space, and an adequate back seat for occasional use.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it to people that have young children that require car seats.  It's difficult to lean into the back seat of any two door car...and this is no exception.<br><br>
