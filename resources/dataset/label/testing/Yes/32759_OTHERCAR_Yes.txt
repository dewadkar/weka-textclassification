            I have always wanted a Camero Z-28 because it is a great car.  It has lots of power, very stylish, and has great performace.  There are three type available today, the Z-28, the regular, and the legendary SS.  There are a couple of drawback though, one is that it is rear-wheel drive, so snowy conditions make transportation hard.  Another is that there is very little trunk space.  A third is that the interior is small for a large person.  And finally, Insurance is very expensive.<br><br>
