            A Sport Utility Vehicle with great options at a great price. Comes loaded. Great Gas Mileage, good storage and handles well.If they made a six door model, the Suburban would be in trouble. Fun to drive. Easy to do preventative maintenance. Some thought went into this car. Would have trouble seating four large adults, but perfect for the young family of four or less. Engine purrs even after 45,000 with no breakdown. Regular preventative maintenance and this car will last over 200,000 miles. Corners great and has very good top end speed. Suggestion : Buy if your just starting out a family, the Gas mileage will pay for the car over four years.<br><br>
