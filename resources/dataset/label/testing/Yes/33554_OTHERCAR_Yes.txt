            The main reason why i bought this product in the first place is because of the price. I paid only $200 back in August 00 for a megapixel digital camera which was and still is a very good price for digital cameras. I got it for $250 from pcmall.com and got a manufacturer's rebate for $50.

I also liked it because this camera was able to have a 2x zoom and also take pictures in Black and White. Another reason is the USB connection that comes with the package. With the USB connection, I'm able to download pictures in just a few seconds. Serial connections, however, take quite sometime to download.  

So, on the day my camera arrived, I was extremely excited. However, I've come to find some very irritating things about this camera. I tried setting the date and time, but it never stays. As soon as I turn off the camera, they info gets lost. Very irritating!!

It also u ses up batteries like crazy. I bought some re-chargable ones but if it wasn't for that, I'd be spending alot on batteries. 

The LCD display get's messed up sometimes. When you switch it on it won't come on and also sometimes when the camera is initially started, it won't take pictures for a while.
