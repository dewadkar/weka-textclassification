            This is the best vehicle I've ever purchased.  Isuzu trucks have long provided durable service in Japan (lived there 3 years).  My 92 Rodeo has only had 2 significant repairs in 7 years, both under warranty.  A bolt on the head sheared, requiring replacement.  Also, a lug on one tire sheared and needed replacement (possibly due to operator error, mine). Gas mileage ~16mpg city, ~22mpg highway.  I've put 105k miles on this vehicle, and it drives like it did brand new.  When it finally retires, probably many years from now, I'll probably buy another.  The mileage doesn't compare well to cars, but the comfort rivals the Taurus I have.  Oddly enough, I have absolutely no complaints.  If you don't mind a SUV that shifts like a truck and handles like a big car, you would love the Rodeo.  I've driven a relative's Jeep Cherokee, a friend's Montero, a friend's Blazer and my brother's Jeep CJ.  I wouldn't trade my Rodeo for any of them (all newer), since they didn't handle as comfortably and didn't feel as responsive to driving conditions.<br><br>
