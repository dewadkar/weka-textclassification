            I needed a vehicle after my trusty Toyota 2x2 had to be turned in after 175,000 miles for its parts.  I wanted another vehicle that was just as dependable and absolutely there whenever I needed it.  That's why I test-drove the Subaru Forester.  It was highly rated by a consumer magazine, so I felt that information plus my positive experience during the 20-minute test drive provided all the information I needed.

Well, I was in many ways mistaken.

The first problem came three days after I drove my car home. The &quot;check engine&quot; light would flash periodically, occasionally staying lit for five or ten minutes at a time.  After a few weeks, it remained on for about an hour at a time.  My dealer told me that I must be imagining it.  After a month, the light stayed on all the time. The dealer then acknowledged there was a problem.  The problem was even greater than the dealer expected.  There were three fuses to be ordered, not one, so my Forester stayed in the shop for several days. Kudos to Subaru, however, in that I was provided a loaner car. At about 6,000 miles the brake system started to whine and squeak.  As the weeks wore on, the occasional whine developed into a constant whistle upon braking.  After repeated visits to my dealer (who said it was the cause of brake dust), and $40.00 a visit, I gave up.  I have now been riding with my whistling brakes on my 2000 Subaru for the last 9,000 miles.  

The heating system leaves much to be desired.  Where my Toyota provided ample and ready heat, my Forester does not.  Until 3,000 rpms are sustained for a period of time, the heater never warms up.  So if you live in an urban area like me, it may take fifteen or twenty minutes before any heat materializes.  

I find the ride very &quot;pokey and croakey&quot; in that there is a great deal of hesitation and lack of pick-up, especially on the slightest incline. I would swear that after every 5,000 miles my Forester feels as if it needs a tune-up.  Perhaps this is due to the four cylinder automatic.  Maybe a V6 would cure this problem.

The greatest strength of the 2000 Forester as I see it is its design. 
Furniture, appliances, televisions, a full-sized headboard, a wheelchair, all fit at various times within the interior without a problem.  The squared-off design provides a tremendous sense of space as well as superb headroom. The front seats are much more comfortable than the rear seats.  The ABS brakes and all-wheel drive are fantastic.  I felt safer in last winter's ice and snow than I have in many years.

All in all, I would award the Subaru Forester 2000 a possible two-and-one -half  (to a possible) three stars.
