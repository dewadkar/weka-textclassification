            I have a 1995 Chevy Camaro V-6 with auto transmission with t-tops and every power feature available.

I bought this vehicle new when I was a senior in high school, and have had it every since.  It is paid for now, I just made my last payment a couple of months ago.  Over the last 5 years there have been many days I have just been way over-joyed with the car and many days I have been so upset with it and ready to sell it.  Overall though the car has been a relatively good car.  I have no children, so therefore have no family to haul around which makes me able to keep the car, which since it is paid for now I'll probably keep it until it dies. I got it with 8 original miles and it now has about 90,000.  It has been in the shop for a number of different things, but mostly for maintinance upkeep.. for example, breaks, tires, fuel filter, and other minor things.  The major things that I have done to the car are I had a rear axle leak, which caused me to have to replace the rear axle seal, rear breaks, and clean the rear wheel (big pain in the a--) but besides minor things, i have never had a problem with the car.  The main complaints, but in my opinion with a sports car can't be complaints, are that the rear seats are too small for my friends to fit in comfortably... but compared with other sports cars, they aren't too bad.  I am also not too big on the plastics on the interior, they seem cheap, although still look original, and really don't make much noise if any, but still could've used something that didn't look as cheap.

I have the oil changed every 3,000 miles and the car hasn't had any problems and fix the things that go wrong with them as they happen, and as of yet, it has been the way to do it.  I can also see how if this car wasn't kept up or mistreated that it wouldn't be a good car to buy used, but if it was treated correctly then I would recommend the car to others, especially new, since the cost is low, power is high and envy of my friends is relatively high, due to it being such a great looking car.  Another point is I wouldn't have bought this car without it having t-tops, in my opinion the t-tops make the car.  If I had it to do over again the only difference I would've made was I would've opted for the manual transmission instead, but I have been pleased with the responsiveness of the automatic.  So if you are considering buying a used camaro around this year, be cautious of who your buying it from and definately have it inspected to see how they have treated the car, and if it turns out on the better side, then the car should be a wonderful asset and should give you lots of enjoyment.  They are well worth the price new and used, although I'm not really too much on the resale value since I bought mine new... I am just now getting to where I feel comfortable enough to sell it, even though I probably never will.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions feel free to ask them and I'll get back with you!

UPDATE 9/10/02:

To date, I still own this car since new, it has 125,000 miles on it now, and is my daily driver.  Through the 7 years I have owned the car now, it has had a few minor problems, but nothing that has cost me more than $200, which in my opinion is pretty great!  I haven't had a car payment in 2 years now, and the only thing I have done to it is add new tires that usually last about 30,000 miles, change the oil every 3,000 miles, and other scheduled maintinance.  I changed the air filter about every 10-12,000 miles, and haven't had a problem, changed the transmission filter once at 75,000 miles, and will probably do that again soon.  It has had 2 tune up's to date consisting of just wires and plugs that I put on myself.  The main problem that I have out of this car, is the break pads only last 15,000 miles or so.  I changed the rotors this time thinking it could be the problem, so I will have to let you know in another update if that was a fix or not.  The only regret that I have ever had from this car was that I wished that I would've gotten the standard shift, but overall this has been one of the best cars I have ever owned.  With 125,000 miles now it still runs like new, still idling at 700 rpm's without any hesitation from the 3.4L V-6.  I use it everyday to drive back and forth to work which is about 75 miles roundtrip.  It still has a nice highway ride at 65, and still will kick down and hit 85 really fast when I need it to.  I highly recommend these cars, and I am considering buying one soon before the end of the Camaro era ends, with Chevrolet ending the model for 2002 (for now at least.)  Even if I buy another one though I will keep this one, just because it is truly a great car, and is paid for... plus I trust it to take back and forth to work for at least another couple of years, so why not????  If you have any questions, just let me know.. and as always I will get back with you!!!!
