            The car has an amazing powertrain that will give you the impression of driving a car with a V6 in it at least. The 5 speed AT is smooth and gives you a good acceleration at any speed. 
The car has an above media sound system, confortable seats and controlls well positioned. The brakes work very well in dry/wet/snow and the tires provide a good grip/handling even though they are a bit too stiff and that makes the car feel any crack in the asphalt.
Good fuel economy (no more than 10l/100km in winter with -25degrees Celsius) 
On the down side:
-an annoying vibration at idle was somehow fixed at the dealer by installing an IDLE KIT that is available at Honda Canada from Dec 1st/03. 
-problem that I had and many cars buid in USA around May 2003 may have it was with the rear speakers. They were rattling with volume at 10 (max 40). The problem was that the speaker cover (plastic one) had an sticky sponge on it that was pressing on the speaker itself. Being like that for a long time, the speaker got damaged. Both rear speakers were replaced by the dealer
-A few rattles in the doors that will be fixed (hopefully) at my next oil change

 Overall, I'm very satisfied with the car an I think that the minor problems that I had with the car were fixed in a timely manner by the dealer.

 I would recommend it anyone looking for a car as a must see/test drive.
