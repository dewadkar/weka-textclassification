            I have now owned my Cadillac Eldorado ETC for 3 years and have been very pleasantly surprised by its utter luxury, reliability &amp; comfort. I have driven luxury cars for many years now and have always tended towards the foreign vehicles available in the US market. I was always displeased with the comfort they offered since I always believed some manufacturer could in fact deliver superb responsiveness &amp; power without using me as the human shock absorber. Lo and behold in comes the Cadillac ETC. This sporty model of the Eldorado series has surpassed all my expectations. Let it be known that I also own a Mercedes Benz SL convertible, one of the premier automobiles of this century with a price tag of over $34000 more than the ETC, and find myself traveling in my ETC at least twice as often. As my odometers verify, with both vehicles at my disposal as they rest side by side in my garage my 4 year old Benz now has 32000 miles on it while my 3 year old ETC boasts of its proudly &amp; comfortably delivered 62000 miles without a breakdown, a squeak or a rattle. The Benz has been in the shop twice for &quot;minor adjustments&quot;. Further some regular maintenance checks in the Benz run over $500.00 each while the ETC at twice the mileage has yet to cost me more than $150.00 for any one thing. Bravo General Motors for a job well done!<br><br>
