            Test Car:
1995 Chevrolet Suburban K1500 4WD 

Features as tested:  
8 cyl 5.7L Engine, Aluminum/Alloy Wheels, AM/FM/Cassette Audio System, Automatic Dimming Rearview Mirror, Leather Bucket Seats, Camper Mirrors, Towing Package, Center Bench Seat, Center Console, Cruise Control, Dual Zone Air Conditioning, Keyless Entry System, Leather Seats, Leather Steering Wheel, Locking Differential, Luggage Rack, Overhead Console, Power Door Locks, Power Driver Seat, Power Mirrors, Power Windows, Privacy Glass, Rear Heater, Rear Window Defroster, Rear Window Wiper, Remote Trunk Release, Removable third row bench seat, Tilt Steering Wheel.  

Interior:
This is a very spacious vehicle that is equally adept at hauling 8 people or lumber.  This truck has three rows of nice quality leather seats.  The front seats are bucket, the second and third rows are bench.  The third row is easily removable and the second row folds down, to create an incredibly large trunk.  Gauges and dashboard controls arrangement is intuitive.  Paneling and moldings are cheap plastic and don't fit together seamlessly.  Dual zone climate control is a must for a car this large.  Many air vents and cup holders.  Center console is useful, and overhead console is very well designed (maplights, sunglasses holder, garage door opener holder).

Exterior:
Smooth lines and durable panels grace the exterior.  Not a significant redesign from previous years, but more rounded then past models.  Rust is still a significant concern for these cars, especially if used in the winter.  A good quality rustproofing, like the one available from Ziebart is highly recommended if you want this car to last.

Engine and Suspension:
The 200hp 5.7L V8 engine is not powerful enough for a vehicle of this weight.  Acceleration is sluggish, full-open throttle is frequent needed for traversing even the slightest grades.  I would highly recommend getting a model with a bigger engine.  The 310ft-lbs. torque does make for a capable hauler, its rated for up to 6000lbs.    The suspension is soft and quite refined for a truck that size, it actually feels like you are driving a car.  The truck does wallow a bit on the highway though.  

Economy:
The purported gas milage for this truck is 13mpg in the city and 17mpg on the highway.  Unfortunately, those numbers are accurate.  To combat the abismal gas milage, the Suburban comes with a 42 gallon tank.  Get used to ~$50 fill-up.

Reliability:
This truck is marred by poor reliability.  Consumer reports list this truck as far below average reliability.  I have personally noticed problems with the cooling system (leak), electric system (window motor problems), air conditioning system (leaked from several places), and exhaust system (pipes rusted through). This all happened in under 100,000 miles!  Remember the rust issue discussed above.

Misc:
The brakes are not great.  ABS is nice, but its only on the front wheels.  The back wheels are drums, which are completely inadequate for stopping a truck of this weight.  4WD offers incredible traction, especially in mud and snow.  If you get snow tires for this car, nothing can stop you. 

Driving Experience:
This is one refined truck, it feels like I'm driving a car.  Ride is pretty smooth with highway tires.  The Suburban is surprising agility for its size, maneuvering is a easy.  Cornering is very sturdy, with very little leaning.  Even in emergency situations, this truck never feels like it might tip.   

Final thoughts:
This is an incredible truck for large families or anyone who does a lot of hauling (trailer or otherwise).  It has a refined, car-like ride, but weak engine.  The ride is smooth and comfortable, with good manuverability for its size.  The body is prone to rust and the reliability and gas milage are poor.
