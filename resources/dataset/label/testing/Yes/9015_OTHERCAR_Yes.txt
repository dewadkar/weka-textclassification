            I purchased my Kia sportage because I needed a roomier vehicle that was easy to get my baby in to and I needed 4 wheel drive for the winter. After purchasing my Kia I took a work trip to the mountains of Western Maryland as was shocked at how well KIA handled climbing the mountains. the vehicle never hesitated or slowed down like some other 4 cyl. vehicles who are pushed to the limit the gas mileage during this trip was about 23 miles to the gallon which I thought was great for a SUV and the road conditions. The vehicle was also very comfortable for the 5 hour ride, I hardly even noticed how long it took. The Kia is also an easy car to drive,because of the way it is designed you can easily see to change lanes or back up. AS far as getting my child into the car it is also great, the seatbelts easily adjust for a car seat, and he loves it because he can see out of the window while we drive. I only have 1000 miles on my KIA so I have not yet experienced any service issues but if it continues to handle the way it has I will be a KIA owner for a long time.<br><br>
