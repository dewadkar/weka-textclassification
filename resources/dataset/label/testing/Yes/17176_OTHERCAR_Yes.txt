            The date is March 10, 2002. A few months ago I purchased my Maxima (1997) with 54,500 miles at a dealer for 10,800 at a Nissan dealership. It has been the best purchase I made in my lifetime! If you are looking for a sedan, I highly recommend looking for a Maxima, especially if you can get a price like I got.

Imagine... I got this car which is only about 4 years old, but over half the cost as it was brand new. I definitely recommend looking for a gently used Max 97-99 at a good price. Be patient, bargain, and you will find the car of your dreams.

One great thing about the Maxima is that not a lot of people know about the quality and ride of this car. They think only Accords or Camrys are good, which is why they have slightly higher resale value, which is great for the potential Maxima buyer, because he can get a used Maxima for a tremendous value.

I tried various models of the Accord and Camry's (mostly 96-99 years). The Accord is way  overrated. The one I tried was nice and zippy (6 cylinder) but the seat comfort and space cannot begin to contend with a Maxima. Also why get an expensive 6 cylinder Accord, when that comes standard in Maximas. Also why get one of the most stolen cars in the US?

The Camry's were more disappointing. The most prominent impression I got, were that the Camry's were the most  "heavy" feeling rides of the three sedans. The styling and spaciousness were slightly better than the Accords, but the ride definitely felt weighted. (Not enough power to weight ratio).

My Maxima is a definite pleasure to drive; smooth, powerful, great turn ratio, easy to get in and out of, classy looking and extremely comfortable! Not to mention that under the hood is one of the top ten engines in the WORLD! (V6 3.8) The reliability on this Nissan flagship car is excellent, although I wouldnt recommend the other Nissan sedans. It looks like Nissan put most of their effort into the Maximas.

The only drawbacks that I have encountered so far is that Nissan recommends premium fuel for best performance for this high powered engine. Take note of "recommends" not "required". Also the paint job looks a little "thin". Just slightly, I don't see any fading or anything, but I read somewhere that Nissans are not famous for their paint jobs. So maybe.. its all in my mind..i'm not  sure yet. My black Max still looks awesome though. Just take special care to keep it waxed and out of the sun whenever possible.

I also got a good deal on a 4 year, 48k mile warranty for added measure. Its just for a little extra assurance. Most cars will need AC service, etc. sometime or another anyway. If you can find a good deal on an added warranty, get one. You can even try negotiating it into your price, if you are buying from a dealer (preferrable a certified Nissan dealer) .  Or try Warrantydirect.com. They have good deals there too. Also the suspension is not quite as good as a 2002, but hey at 10,000 less, who's complaining?
