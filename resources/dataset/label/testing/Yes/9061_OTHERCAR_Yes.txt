            The 3 series is a great car.  It's comfortable, sporty has a great motor (both 318 4 cylinder and 325 6 cylinder).  Now which to get.  This is the first year of the E36 model year that took over the previous E30 line.  A tad roomier.  A tad heavier.  With a lot of aftermarket possibilities.  I have many Dinan upgrades that virtually transforms the car. The main question is do you want a coupe or a 4 door.  If you want a coupe a convertible is available but unless you're a woman (no offense) it doesn't suit a man very well.  If you do get the coupe shoot for the 325is model or look for later years 328is (a bigger motor with the same HP as the 325 but more torque).  With the IS you get better suspension, LSD (limited slip differential, nicer wheels and a better look.  If you opt for the 4 door as I have look for the winter driving package.  This was a factory option that gave the LSD and heated seats.  The torque of the inline 6 is great and has on demand power without getting too crazy.  18" wheels with 245 40 18 are possible.  255 35 18 will rub!!!  Electronics can be quirky.  Tail light failure message is common and can be fixed.  Rear windows don't roll down from the rear controls on my car.  Almost like the child safety is permanently on.  I can roll them up and down from the front with no problem.  My drivers seat heater no longer works.  My A/C discharged after 10 years and now has been recharged.  The brakes tend to eat rotors. I think OEM rotors are soft.  Plastic water pump impelar is crap and can be upgrated with a metal unit (highly recommended!)  Many M3 parts fit to allow easy upgrading.   The stock suspension sucks. It's too soft and wanders.  With a simple spring and swaybar upgrade the car handles like it should.  the 325is doesn't have this problem.  If it where me and I was looking at this car.  I would save the additional $5~7k and buy the E36 M3.... for $8~12k this is a great car and is hard to beat in this price range.
