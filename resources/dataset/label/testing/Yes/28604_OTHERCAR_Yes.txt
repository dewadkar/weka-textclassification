            If someone were to buy any type of a Mitsubishi automotive product, I would have to say that the Mirage (a.k.a., prior to 1996, as the Eagle Summit and Dodge/Plymouth Colt) is the most reliable.  It offers decent gas mileage for an affordable price.  The Mirage was the first type of automobile Mitsubishi made for Chrysler.  This occurred since the two auto makers had a contractual partnership.  Since Chrysler sold the Mirage under the brand name of the Colt, it was mechanically refined over time as each new model year came up.  This refinement allowed a mechanically reliable car to emerge.  It has excellent gas mileage and great acceleration.  My only major complaint is that the brakes wear down too easily, and the driver does not the feel like the car is very responsive to braking.   <br><br>
