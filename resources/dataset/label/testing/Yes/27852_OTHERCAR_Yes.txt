            It&#146s not new.  It doesn&#146t have sexy lines, or any newfangled, state-of-the-art gizmos in it.  Almost completely devoid of that curvaceous, 21st century aerodynamic design so popular nowadays, it sits frumpily in my driveway, shimmering white, kinda short, squat, and boxy&#133 A rather ordinary looking vehicle by all accounts.  Yet, in the five short months I&#146ve owned my 1994 Dodge Caravan mini-van, I&#146ve come to love it almost as much (but not quite!) as my 2001 Ford Ranger pick-up truck.

Why, you might ask, would I write a review of a nine-year old vehicle when there's such a plethora of sleek, highfalutin, high-tech, multi-featured mini-vans out there  begging to be reviewed?  Well, folks, I just couldn&#146t help myself.  My admittedly antiquarian Dodge Caravan has already proven itself such a good vehicle that I felt the need to pay it its due.  Besides... I'm sure there are more than just a few of you out there who probably don&#146t want to shell out the $30,000 or so needed to buy a brand new mini-van.  An older mini-van, especially one that&#146s in as good a shape as mine, could turn out to be an excellent alternative.

In January 2003, I got a new job&#133 as a rural mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).  For the first time in a couple years, I am now employed on a regular basis.  One of the Postal Service requirements for rural mail carriers is that they provide their own transportation.  The USPS  wants its mail carriers&#146 vehicles to present a clean, "professional" looking appearance, and be reliable and in good mechanical condition.  As it turns out, my 2001 Ford Ranger pickup doesn't fit the bill for "haulin&#146 the mail." Since I'm required to operate the vehicle from the front passenger&#146s seat, the Ranger, with its 5-speed manual transmission,  would be nearly impossible to control.  My wife&#146s Ford ZX2 is just plain too small to carry all the letter mail and packages I take out on my route every day.  I need a large, spacious vehicle with an automatic transmission.

My wife&#146s parents provided an immediate solution to my problem.  Neither of them drive any more, so they sold me their 1994 Dodge Caravan.  My father-in law bought it new in April 1994; over the years, he used it so infrequently that, by the time I bought it, it only had 51,000 miles on it.  When not in use, it was stored in my in-laws&#146 garage, so it never really  was exposed to the harsh Maine winters.  Today it's in absolutely "mint" condition!

The Dodge Caravan has turned out to be the perfect mail delivery vehicle&#133 as well as a superb grocery shopping vehicle, and "deliver-son-to-baseball-game" vehicle, and "take-family-out-for-the-day" vehicle, and just about any of the dozens of uses for a mini-van that we&#146ve found over the past few months.

Here are just a few of the features I like about my 1994 Dodge Caravan:

<b><i>* Smooth, quiet ride:</i></b>  The 1994 Dodge Caravan has an excellent ride, as one might expect from what is essentially an oversized car.  The van&#146s suspension is firm enough so that the vehicle doesn&#146t wallow on bumpy roads (and we have plenty of <i>those</i> around here!!) and yet pliable enough to eliminate almost every jolt caused by bumps and potholes in the road.  The interior is whisper-quiet.  Barely any road or wind noise can be heard, even at highway speeds.

<b><i>* Plenty of "git-up-and-go!!</i></b> This particular Caravan comes equipped with a 3.0 liter V-6 engine mounted transversely in the engine bay.  The engine is plenty powerful enough to take the van from a dead stop onto any street or highway in a matter of only a few seconds.  There&#146s also plenty of pick-up for passing and getting onto a divided highway from an on-ramp.  The responsive V-6 engine purrs quietly at all speeds.

The van&#146s transmission (technically, it's a "transaxle," since the Caravan is a front wheel drive vehicle, and the transmission and differential are combined into one unit.) shifts very smoothly.  The shifter is column-mounted, has no "slop," and provides clearly discernible detents for each gear.  

<b><i>* Very good handling:</i></b>  One of the more pleasant surprises I found with the 1994 Dodge Caravan is how well it handles.  Mind you, it ain&#146t no sports car, and you&#146d better not try whippin&#146 one around a sharp curve at 60-plus; with due care, however, the Caravan goes exactly where you aim it with no "wander" or pull from side to side.  It&#146s very well behaved at all speeds.

<b><i>* Simple and pleasing interior design:</i></b> I&#146ve long adhered to a "rule of thumb" that states: "simpler is often better."  Nothing epitomizes that maxim better than the interior of my 1994 Dodge Caravan.  It&#146s positively elegant in its simplicity!  In front are two captain&#146s chairs that are very comfortable.  Covered in a burgundy colored velour material, they adjust easily forwards and backwards; the seat backs are also fully adjustable.  There are no adjustments for lumbar support, height above floor, or firmness, but that&#146s okay.  The seats are very comfortable as they are.

Access to the van&#146s interior is very good.  The front doors, sliding side door, and tailgate are all large and, when open, provide a cavernous opening through which you may enter or exit the vehicle.  Since the van sits slightly higher off the ground than a passenger car, it&#146s but a short and convenient step up to get in or step down to get out.

Visibility is excellent.  The windshield, side windows, and tailgate window are all large and provide the driver and passengers with an almost unobstructed panoramic view of the highway ahead and the scenery to the sides and back.

In the center and back positions, behind the captain&#146s chairs, are two bench seats.  The center bench seat can be placed on one of two sets of floor anchors, to allow for more or less leg room, at the owner&#146s discretion.  The center bench seat has no back adjustment; in fact, you can&#146t even put the seat back down.  The back bench seat fits on to one set of floor anchors.  You can put the back seat in to face either forward or backward, depending on your preference.  You can also fold the seat back down for added storage space.  That&#146s how I fit extra mail trays and packages into the van on days when I deliver to the primary route.

The instrument panel and controls are all simple, and easy to read and operate.  The instrument panel is comprised of a large analogue speedometer in the center, a large temperature gauge to the left of the speedometer, and a large fuel gauge to the right.  All other indicators take the form of "idiot lights," all clustered in an "information center" on top of the dashboard directly in front of the driver.

The AM/FM stereo radio is pretty good.  It has excellent reception and good sound.  Alas there&#146s no cassette player or CD player, but that&#146s more because that&#146s what the original owner wanted.  

Environmental controls are very good indeed.  The heater is quick and very efficient.  It&#146ll take moisture off the windows in a matter of seconds.  The air conditioner cools very well&#133 almost too well at times.  A couple of times during this past week, when it finally got hot, I almost turned the interior of the van refrigerator cold.  Now, <i>that&#146s</i> efficiency!

<b><i>* Loads of cargo space!</i></b>  Of course, the major reason I bought this mini-van was to haul the mail.  I needed plenty of cargo space to accomodate (on average) three trays of letters and 10 parcels on my short (125 stops) mail delivery route, and 8 letter trays and up to 50 parcels on the long (500 stops) mail route.

My 1994 Caravan "hauls the mail" beautifully!  I was quickly able to develop a storage system that lets me take advantage of all the space the van gives me, while at the same time making it easy for me to change letter trays and reach parcels.  I haven't yet had to remove the bench seats to make room for the mail... but I'm interested to see if  that will happen during the upcoming Christmas season.

<b><i>Excellent reliability:</i></b> I haven&#146t owned the Caravan long enough to get a feel for how reliable it will be.  But, if my father-in-law&#146s recommendation and  maintenance records are any indicators, the 1994 Dodge Caravan is a mechanically sound and very reliable vehicle.  In the nine years he owned it, my father-in-law only had to turn it in to the shop once for an actual repair&#133 and that was caused by a piece of wood in the road that caused slight damage to the undercarriage.  Mind you, my father-in-law was meticulous in making sure scheduled maintenance was always done on time.  See&#133? Those 3,000 mile oil change/lube/tire rotations <i>do</i> make a difference! 

Here&#146s a couple of features that could have been improved:

<b><i>Leg room in front:</i></b>  It may be okay for the average person six feet tall or shorter; but for someone like me, with my six-foot-three-inch frame, the van's leg room, with the seats adjusted all the way back, is just plain too short.

<b><i>Interior configuration can be difficult:</i></b>  Removing and installing those bench seats is definitely NOT something you want to do very often, unless it&#146s absolutely necessary.  They&#146re heavy and cumbersome and usually require two people to remove or install.

<b><i>MY VERDICT:</i></b>  Although it started out as "just" a mail truck, my 1994 Dodge Caravan has evolved into much more than that over the past few months.  It&#146s become a real workhorse around the ol&#146 mkp51 homestead&#133 an all purpose recreational and work vehicle.  Everyone&#133 my wife, our daughters, and our son &#150 loves driving it or riding in it.  And, while it may never completely replace my Ranger in versatility or hard use, it&#146s gonna be around for a long, long time.
