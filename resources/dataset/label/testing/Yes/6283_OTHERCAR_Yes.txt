            When shopping around for a newer used vehicle, I was in store to buy either a Mazda 626 or a Mitsubishi Galant.  After test driving both, I found that the Galant was much more of a &quot;driver's&quot; car.  It was more quiet at highway speeds than the 626.  The ergonomics are far superior to the Mazda 626's as well.  Although Mitsubishi didn't offer a V-6 powerplant for the Galant, it is a very smooth powerplant that seems more refined than the V-6 powered Mazda I test drove.  I shopped around for different trim levels and found that the ES was the best all around trim level for the money.  Of all the things I love about this car, it would have to be the excellent sound deadening.  This has to be one of the quietest cars I have ever been in.  About the only thing that I would have to dislike about the car is that it has a little too much body roll, but since I don't drive the car hard, I feel that this isn't much of a problem.  Another thing about the Galant is the fact that it is hard to find any body kits/performance upgrades for it.  I have yet to find a manufacturer who makes direct bolt-on parts for this car.  
Anyone who is looking for a reliable vehicle at a lower price range than a Honda or a Toyota should seriously check into getting a Galant.  Those who plan on souping up a Galant should shop elsewhere for cars, because the aftermarket is in thin supply of any performance upgrades for this car.  If this is what you're after, get a Civic or something.  <br><br>
