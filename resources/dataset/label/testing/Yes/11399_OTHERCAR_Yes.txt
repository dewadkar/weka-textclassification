            I first got involved with 4runner when it was, in essence, a pickup with a camper shell on it.  What an evolution for an exceptional vehicle.  Dont look for frills, whistles and bells, rather a solid dependable vehicle that will do virtually, within reason, anything you ask for it to do.  The reason Toyota is the best value vehicle in the world.  A vehicle you can not go wrong with.  Try it yourself and see.  This will be the best, not most comfortable or softest riding, but best vehicle you will ever own.  Highly recommended.  While there are new SUV's coming on the market daily, and they are all proclaiming they ride like a car, this is not the market the 4Runner is designed for.
