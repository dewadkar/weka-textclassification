            -- Intro --

This is a 2.1 megapixel digital camera from Canon.  It has a magnesium body and is pretty small and light weight.  It takes multi-media flash cards and can even take the IBM Microdrive (which is something like 1 Gig of space).  I currently have a 48 meg card in it and that allows me to take 70, 1600x1200 pictures.  That's 70 pictures.

-- The Good ---

I bought my camera around x-mas 1999 and haven't looked back since.  There isn't anything new on the market that I can see that can beat it besides the Canon S110 which is a bit smaller.

Picture quality:  I take all of my pictures at 1600x1200 resolution.  The color quality seems to be well balanced and it seems to pick up lighting very well.  I am not a professional photographer but if I was I don't think I would be using a digital camera anyway. 

Features:  This thing is jam packed full of features.  Most of them I don't even use.  I pretty much switch in between manual mode (to turn off the flash) and auto mode (to activate the flash).  I just point and shoot.  I have used the timer delay on occasion and haven't had much use for the micro feature (which allows you to take closeup pictures with great detail).

Also, it should be noted that this thing is put together very well.  It has been dropped, leaving a nice dent in the corner of it but absolutely nothing has gone wrong with it.

-- The Bad --

The battery life isn't the greatest with this thing.  Around 50 pictures it is toast.  I am definitely glad that I bought and extra battery with it.  It's been a life saver.

-- The Ugly --

There is none.
