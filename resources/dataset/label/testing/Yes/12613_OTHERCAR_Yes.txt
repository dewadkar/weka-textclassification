            I am by no means a professional photographer.  At best, I'm a casual, vacation, take some nice pictures type.  However, I do see digital cameras as an important part of the future of photography.  After researching for months to choose a digital camera, I finally settled on the Canon S10.  With about 1 week's worth of pictures now taken, I am still sure I made the right choice.  My criteria were:

1) Buy from a company that knows how to make cameras
2) High resolution (i.e. 2 megapixel or greater)
3) Portability
4) Easy connection to PC
5) CompactFlash media or, even better, CompactFlash type II

Ok, so the Canon does fit all these criteria.  Above all else, however, it takes great pictures with limited adjustments.  That's not to say that you can't do a lot of tweaking if you want.  You just don't have to.

Since owning this camera, I've also discovered another feature I didn't realize.  This camera has an incredible &quot;cool factor&quot;, and many people have expressed to me their &quot;camera envy&quot;!  Digital cameras may never replace film, but they will certainly continue to grow in popularity for the foreseeable future.  With the S10, Canon has done its part to ensure this.

Ok, so what are the negatives???  Well, nothing major, but here's my list so far:

1) In the U.S., the rechargeable battery and charger are not included with the camera, and cost an extra $90 or so.  This is an absolute accessory to buy, and really should have been in the package, as it is in other countries.

2) One of my reasons for choosing this camera was the CompactFlash type II slot, which allows for the use of the IBM microdrive.  While I have not purchased the drive yet, I continue to hear/read stories of incompatibility problems.  I know that Canon and IBM are working on this, but it's currently still a problem.

That's about it.  Overall, a great 1st camera for the amateur, and I think a great additional camera for the professionals as well.<br><br>
