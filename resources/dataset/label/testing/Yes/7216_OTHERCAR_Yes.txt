            This two-door V6 automatic Mercury Cougar is one of the finest cars my wife and I have ever owned. Everything about this car shows what fine detail was paid to not only the design but the interior features as well. Along with the smooth ride the seats wrap you in comfort and feature a lumbar support with easily located controls. The steering is tight making for great cornering with the acceleration to handle any highway situation. Traction control system is built in along with trip computer, temperature, average speed, miles remaining in tank, mpg, digital clock, rear window defroster &amp; rear window wiper. My second favorite feature after the great acceleration is the six disc cd changer located in the trunk. Makes it very convenient for our &quot;road trips&quot; when we want to be rocking down the highway. Another cool feature with this stereo system is the AVC or automatic volume control. This is a new one for me. When you pull off the highway or stop at a light the volume automatically lowers according to the &quot;road noise&quot; which is something I had done myself for years without thinking about it. How convenient! We just love this car and will probably get another one next year. Our Ford &amp; Mercury dealer makes the lease/option a very useful way to drive new cars on a budget.<br><br>
