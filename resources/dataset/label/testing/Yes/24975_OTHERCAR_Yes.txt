            In a nutshell I&#146d have to say that I love this Jeep.  There are certain things about it that drive me nuts but with any marriage that is going to happen.  My 98 Dodge Intrepid was showing wear and tear and so I decided that it was time to let the old girl rest.  She may be resting as a three-foot block of sheet metal right now in the middle of Newark but I would rather not think about that.  I did my research as an educated adult should and I was drawn into the controversial world of the SUV.  SUV can mean different things to different people.  To me it meant something I can sit up in and see over the roofs of others.  Something that would command some attention, something that would move when I asked it to and something that I could throw into four-wheel drive to avoid the other crazy people on the road during a New Jersey snow storm.  I found that and more in my 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport.

       This thing is rugged.  My girlfriend tries to get under my skin by telling me that it&#146s &#147cute&#148.  I find the lines manlier then feminine but I have seen quite a few ladies behind the wheel of the Liberty.  The large headlights give the vehicle a bug-eyed alert look.  Kind of like an excited dog saying to it&#146s owner &#147okay&#133where we going, where we going?&#148  This Jeep looks more tall than long. That leads me to the first of my few gripes. I feel that it lacks sufficient cargo space.  If they stretched it another eight inches or so it would balance out the look and expand the tight payload area.  It also looks like it&#146s a bit top heavy and that it may topple over on a curved off ramp.  Let me say that I have never felt uneasy.  It handles like a dream.  I bought the &#147sport&#148 model, which means I got the mid-class and so, less adorned Jeep Liberty.  The four fenders are black matte plastic.  Other than that I would challenge anyone to tell the difference from the Sport to the Limited from the exterior.  The spare tire hangs off the swinging back gate and so it doesn&#146t take up the precious cargo area inside.  It&#145s also handier than kneeling in roadside mud to retrieve your tire from beneath after an unfortunate tire pop.  Mine came with stock wheels and 16 inch tires.  If I had bought my Jeep, instead of leasing it, I would seriously consider upgrading my treads to something more eye catching.  It comes equipped with a roof rack but not the crosspieces.  They are extra for a hundred dollars or so.  The fit and finish is quite good.  I opted for the burgundy color (though that is not the official color name, which escapes me at the moment).

       I&#146d like to try and keep this review brief so now lets take a look inside. We have a 60/40 split back bench seat in the rear and two buckets in the front.  I wouldn&#146t want to ride in the back for too long.  I am a large man and I really don&#146t feel the need to get reacquainted with my knees at this point in my life.  I could bear a ride of 20 miles or so.  My teenaged kids have taken longer rides back there and they don&#146t seem to mind.  The drivers seat was a bit uncomfortable at first.  The lumbar region and the small of my back ached until I got use to it.  Try stuffing a small cushion back there if you feel the same way, it worked for me.  I have plenty of legroom being 6'2".  The leather wrapped steering wheel never gets in my way.  The interior seems narrow but that doesn&#146t bother me either.  I am sitting up high and secure with a great all around view of the road.  The controls are laid out in a fairly clean fashion.  It took me a while to get use to the window switches near the console and I feel that I have to stretch a little too much reaching for the radio/CD controls.  All the basic functions of an automobile work well.  The heating system heats and the cooling system cools&#133which is cool.  The CD/radio is competent but certainly not audiophile quality.  The lights and wiper controls are in their standard steering wheel column locations and are nicely engineered.  The wheel tilts and the drivers seat adjusts which should be versatile enough for the large or vertically challenged amongst us.  The interior fit and finish is A-1 tops.  I feel that the taupe colored interior is calming and goes great with the &#147burgundy&#148 exterior.

      Okay, we&#146re coming down to the wire.  Why do we buy cars?&#133to GO of course.  This one definitely, GOES!  I have the 6-cylinder 3.7-liter automatic.  Roughly 210 horsepower that whinnies up a storm.  I can punch that gas pedal on a steep hill and it doesn&#146t chug, or burp or gasp for air.  It just GOES! I have never had a vehicle that snaps my head back, this one does.  Of course where there&#146s good news there&#146s bad news.  I&#146m sure you know what&#146s coming since this wasn&#146t the first Jeep Liberty review you ran to.  This Jeep sucks&#133gas.  I love this machine to pieces but I have to say she has an appetite for petrol like few others.  If I got more than 16 miles per gallon I&#146d be pleasantly surprised and quite giddy.  In 15 months of &#147ownership&#148 I have failed to experience, giddy.  I have been frequently on fumes, near broke and my Mobil card has been hot to the touch. And still the giddiness remains elusive. 

    So in closing, you gotta take the good with the bad. This truck has so much good to offer  I think you can easily overlook the bad.  Buy an oil rich country and you won&#146t have to worry about the mileage problem. 

Hmmm&#133sand? That gives me an idea&#133how would my little Liberty like a ride on the Jersey beach?  Huh girl?&#133you&#146d like that?&#133okay then, come on &#133
