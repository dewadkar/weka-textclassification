            As a fan of the original mini (note the lower case) I've been interested in this car for years. While the original mini hasn't been sold in the US since the 60's it has grown a cult following. This is evidenced by the fact that while only 10,000 were imported from the UK in the few yrs (back in the 60's) that they were imported, there are now over 20,000 registered here in the states.

Keeping this in mind, let me tell you why I put a deposit down on the new MINI (again note the case...the new MINI is in all caps)

When I heard that Rover bought the rights to the mini back in 2000, I began to visualize myself FINALLY owning a mini. DOT safety standards kept me from importing a newer mini and I thought that I'd finally be able to get one imported through Rover. This was not to be...

Nearly two years later BMW purchased the Rover group and began work on bringing the MINI to market. Apparently they saw it as a gateway vehicle to enter markets they might not otherwise be able to with the BMW name ...and then someday upsell to a BMW (I can see it now, "would you like a 5 series with that"). The result is a new MINI nearly 2 ft longer, safer and with all the modern conveniences of a Beemer.

While I cannot personally attest to the ride, reviews I've read elsewhere have been nothing short of spectacular. 

From its lack of torque steer due to equal length drive shafts, to its 67 mph average through the slalom (besting Ferrari, Lamborghini and most porches) to its smooth shifting 5 or 6 speed (in the S version), the cooper has been wowing everyone who gets behind the wheel of one.

It currently comes in two models the base model with a spunky 115 HP 1.6L engine and the sportier S version, with its 163 HP supercharged 1.6L engine and enhanced sports suspension. The S also has a noticeable "hood scoop" for the supercharger. 

While the handling has been said to be remarkable, the one area I can personally attest to is the build quality.  Last weekend I sat in one at the local dealer and couldn�t believe the quality and options on a sub 20K car.

Doors were solid, switches felt like they were quality and talk about STYLE!!! In my opinion this car is the first "retro" design that isn�t an abomination (like the underpowered PT cruiser).

All in all the only negative I could come up with was the rear passenger room. While the specs say this is a 4-passenger car, think of it as a 2+2 and your closer to the mark. Regardless, I can't wait for mine to come in!
