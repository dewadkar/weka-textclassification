            Wow!  Cool!  Quiet!  Those are just a few of the words I've used to describe my dark green 2001 Toyota Prius Hybrid!  It is a truly amazing vehicle.  If you're reading this review, then I'm sure you already know it is a hybrid gas/electric car!

The why: After returning from 2 years in Europe, where gas is over $4/gal, I needed to buy a car, and was shopping the gamut from small econo boxes to full size luxury cars.  I had heard about the Prius, but wasn't very interested in it, after having read about the OTHER (Honda) hybrid car, and its lack of performance going up the local mountainside (I live in Seattle...lots of hills).  But, while at the Toyota dealer looking at a Camry, the Prius came into view and I thought, HEY...looks cute.  I then took it to drive for a day, and came back and bought it!  

The facts:  After 4 weeks (1400 miles), I'm averaging 42 mpg (combined city/highway on my daily commute).  City trips will put it over 50 mpg.  The test car averaged 48 mpg on a road trip up the mountains, driving 70, with the A/C on.  The car is peppy.  Has room for 4 adults, no problem.  Plenty of headroom and legroom (I've just over 6'). ITS QUIET!!!  I'm told the emissions are 1/10th a normal vehicle.  It cost just under $21,000 loaded (a/c, power steering/brakes/windows/door locks, anti-lock brakes, alarm, stereo, keyless remote entry, air bags, are standard) and the two options, a CD player and floor mats.  I had an 8 week wait.  Std warranty, except on the Hybrid system which has an 8 year warranty.

The amazement: After a month, I'm still amazed at the technology.  I love coming to a stoplight, and not hearing a thing.  The engine shuts off, the car just sits.  I apply pressure to the accelerator, and zooooom...off we go!  The gas engine will kick in, but unless you're really paying attention, you have no idea when the car is switching back and forth from gas to electric or combining both.  It is seamless.  There is no reving the engine, since the accelerator works with a computer, it isn't a &quot;gas&quot; pedal.  And, with no starter, you just turn the key, and suddenly, the engine is on.  There is no noise of a shifting transmission, because the car uses variable gearing, adding to the fuel efficiency and the quietness.  And, you treat it like any other car.  Turn it on, put it in gear, and go.  There is no plugging in.  The car regenerates power from either the gas engine, or when you coast, or when you brake.  AMAZING!

This is certainly the next step in automotive technology.  You too can be on the cutting edge, and not be in the least compromised in comfort and style and safety.  Toyota has outdone themselves, and I'm a very proud Prius owner!
