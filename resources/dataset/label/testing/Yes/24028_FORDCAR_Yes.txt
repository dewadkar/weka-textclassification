            I just thought since I'd clicked over to 83k miles I'd give everyone an update on how everything is working.  To date she is still running like a dream.  I have faithfully kept up with Ford's recommended maintainance schedule and besides being closer to the ominous 100,000 miles I still can't say anything negative about this vehicle.  


------original epinion:

I thought I had the perfect SUV in the Explorer, then Ford had to come out with the Expedition and completely change my mind.  
I've owned my metalic-silver XLT Expedition for three years now.  I couldn't wait to be one of the first ones on the block to own one.  It is the quintessential American vehicle.  

It has power--I ordered the 5.4L V8 Triton engine with towing package that hasn't been beat yet by anything I try to tow with it.  

It has space!  Tons and tons of space!  The reason I so much like the Expedition over its competitors (namely the suburban) is that I don't have that dopey "third row" taking up all of my cargo space.  If you want something to haul people around, you are better off buying a van (might I recommend a Ford Sherrod).  I'm currently in college and have found that being able to haul all of my stuff between two points twice a year is a breeze when you've got the cargo space of an Expedition.  I'm able to make those runs between the dorms and the storage warehouses with my buds' sofas neatly inside (yes, with the back seats down I get to close the back gate!).

It has plenty of extras!  The 5-disc CD changer is tucked neatly in the middle armrest where it is out-of-the-way, yet reachable by anyone in the truck.  It also comes with rear air, which helps heat or cool all of that cubic space rather quickly.  

It has 4 Wheel Drive!  You can choose between A4WD--which is Ford's version of Traction control where you are in a kind of pseudo-4WD, but at any instant the Xpdition is ready to put power to those wheels that have traction when something starts to slip; 4HI, which is a locked in 4 Wheel Drive mode for running at high speeds; and 4LO, which is a low-gear 4WD where claws come out of the tires and let you get over or through almost any obstacle!(just kidding, but hence "the beast")

It has Size!  I put slightly bigger tires on mine (so my full-size spare isn't exactly "full-size") so my "Beast" sits up just a tad bit higher, giving it a commanding presence on the road.  I love driving behind someone at night and watch them have to adjust their rear-view mirrors because in Low-Beam, I'm blinding them out!

It has range!  This baby came with a 30-gallon gas tank, which it sorely needs.  The ONLY negative to this truck is that it guzzles the gas.  It has gotten me between 10 and 15 miles to the gallon--which isn't bad for what you're getting.  Overall I would highly recommend this to anyone!
