            Purchased this car in the early/mid-90's.  It had the optional V-6 engine 3.1 liter 140 horsepower (doesn't sound like alot, but this was 14 years ago, and at that time the typical six-cylinder had 140-160), 3-speed automatic transmission.  Other options: power windows, pwr locks, full pwr drivers seat, pwr recline on passenger seat, am/fm stereo, a/c, remote trunk release, standard fog lamps, cruise control, full-cluster instrument panel (speedo, tach, gas, oil, volt, temp).  This car was very unassuming.  It was boxy and boring, and never taken for a quick automobile.  Let me tell you, this thing was!  The engine wasn't particularly powerful, but between it, the excellent gear ratios, and its light weight, this car really moves, especially off the line.  Spinning the front wheels happened all too often.  First gear topped out at 50MPH, and believe me, it didn't take too long to get there.  Suspension was tight, took turns well.  Interior room was adequate.  Rear seat room was typical for a mid-size car, or in other words, small.  Stereo was a typical 80's/90's GM radio, 4-speaker, 10 watts.  Car had one cup holder, and very little storage space.  

Best thing about this car was the speed.  This car looked like your typical standard midsize family sedan, but for it's time, it hauled you-know-what.
