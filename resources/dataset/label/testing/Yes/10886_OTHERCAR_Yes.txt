            Photography has always been a huge part of my  life since I was about twelve years old and I absolutely love it.  Recently, my son has expressed interest in photography so i decided to buy him a camera and help him get started with this fun hobby.  So , a couple weeks ago i bought him a PV-DC2590 Palmcam.  Not only does my son love the results that this camera brings, but so do I. I was so amazed at the clarity of the pictures that my son, a mere biginner, was able to take with this amazing camera that I went back to the very same store and bout the exact same camera for myself.  I find this camera superior to my old ones that I have been using for so long.  This camera is more clear and easier to use and focus then any that I have ever used or seen before.  I highly recommend this product to any photographers who desire an easy to use camera that has very clear picture results.<br><br>
