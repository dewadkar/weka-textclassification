            Not wanting a mini van, my husband and I began looking at SUVs and decided on the Ford Expedition.  I am so glad we did.  I've now had it for just over a year and am as happy with it now as the day we drove it off the lot.  
Great turning radius, smooth ride, lots of room.  I love to find antique furniture at flea markets and the Expedition turns into a &quot;truck bed&quot; with the ease of a few pulls and fold downs.  I can transform the back seat to hold a large dresser in about 1 minute. 
My husband, who is 6'4 can comfortable ride in the front OR back seat without feeling cramped. The Expedition with its V8 engine has NO problem merging into LA freeway traffic or fitting into underground parking spaces at the mall.  
I love this car and will replace it with another Expedition when the time comes.  This vehicle is great for just about anyone with its sporty styling, yet room for eight...I would purchase it even if I didn't have children to transport.  The only drawback is of course the miles/gallon compared to an economy car, but for our family that is a con easily outweighed.<br><br>
