            The FD-88 is family, home use oriented camera.  Learning curve time for being reasonably familiar with the unit is about one hour.  The instruction booklet has obviously been translated from Japanese with some strange syntax, but is understandable.  The viewfinder/screen is big and bright enough to be used outside in sunlight and doubles as a playback viewer.  It's able to play back the MPEG movie files with a built in speaker providing sound that was easy to hear.  The camera has various &quot;modes&quot; that allow for low light, fixed focus for people standing in front of scenery, and macro function which takes a while to get used to.  This was the main item in the &quot;learning curve&quot;.  The use of standard 3.5&quot; floppies save a lot of money over other cameras which require purchase of memory sticks or other cards.  When I ran out of disks on vacation I was able to visit the local Wal Mart to get 25 more disks for $5.  With the memory sticks I would have been searching for a computer store.  The camera creates an HTML file on disk making it a piece of cake to view in any browser and point and click to see the pictures.  Picture quality is very good.

The down side for this camera is 1.  Its size.  It is a bit larger than most cameras.  2.  Full zoom really requires a tripod for a steady picture.  
All in all a quality camera worth the price.<br><br>
