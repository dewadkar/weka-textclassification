            ok, so I've always liked big, guzzling, American cars.  I bought a 1994 Sentra so that I could get some dependability for my new wife and even newer daughter.  Now I've had the car for 5 years and I'll list the expenses I've gone through during the five years, complete.

1) wiper blades
2) 3 new tail lamps (bulbs)
3) rebuilt front calipers
4) replaced 2 front tires

Now, that is it, total.  (excepting normal things like gasoline, oil changes and car washes)

This car has started *every* time I turn the key and has never left me stranded anywhere.  I have one more payment due and it's all paid for.
The car dealer got me a VERY bad deal on it because I had little or no credit but the quality of the car has left a great taste in my wallet no matter what I paid for it.  Nissan? - thank you.   And for the Phil Long Nissan dealership? -get bent, my next one comes from a dealer that doesn't gouge me when I'm down.<br><br>
