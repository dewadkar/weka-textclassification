            I have three children three and under which makes life quite an adventure. Knowing that I have a comfortable, safe car to transport us is one less thing for me to worry about.  We bought our Quest when I became pregnant with our third child. My husband and I shopped around but found the Quest to be the most luxurious and safe car in this price range.  We bought a 1998 model and love all the features it provides.  The rear air condition/heating is great!!!  Also our carseat fit snugly into place (which in some minivans is not the case).  
A friend of mine bought the 1999 model and also has the TV and 5th door. These are wonderful additions.  As a busy mom I know that most of the amenities are not options but necessities.
This car is very reliable and isn't a gas guzzler.  One of the best things about is I don't feel like I am driving a truck.  I was afraid that would be the case but I found it to be similar to driving a car.<br><br>
