            I Bought this Vehicle in 1999 after Doing Some Extensive Research into What the Car Is Composed Of.  Although the Car Itself Has Only Been out for Around Two Years, the Engine Has Passed the Test of Time Quite Well. The Model I Bought Has a Six Cylinder 2.5 Liter Engine.  It Is the Same Engine That Has Been Used in the Ford Contour, the Mercury Mystique, and Many Other Ford Assoc. Vehicles.  The Concept for the Cars Design Was Worked on as a Collaboration Between Ford and Mitsubishi. The Outside Appearance Is Very Sharp (It Also Assists Quite Well in Meeting Women:). The Inside Is Incredibly Spacious as Well as Comfortable Considering the Size of the Car.  The Back Seats... Their Better than a Nissan Pulsar at Least. The Interior Is Also Very Modern Looking, and by My Opinion, Pretty Spiffy.  Their Are All Sorts of Options Available, I Suggest the Sports Package as Opposed to the Convenience Package.  The Options Avail, in the Convenience Package Aren't Really Necessary and I Think Will Only Be in Need of Repair in the Future. 

Driving this Vehicle Is Absolutely Amazing. Whether You Are a Practical Person or a Wild Child (Like Myself) this Car Is Perfect.  Fuel Economy Is Great While the Speed and Handling Is Superb. Before I Replaced the Chip. Taking off to 120, No Prob. After the Chip ($80) 150 Mph Easy. It's a Heavy Car with Great Power and Immaculate Suspension. Off Ramps Are Usually Taken at Around 60 - 70 Mph Without Sweating.  Its Fun :).  Second Gear Is Also a Fun Ride.

I Love the Cars Handling, Steering, Pickup, Design, and Ingenuity. I Hate the Radio Face. That's It. I've Put 32,000 Miles on this Car Already and I Have Only Had to Change the Oil and Keep Gas in It.  That's It, No Problems What So Ever.

If You Don't like Nice Looking Cars That Perform Well and Don't Have Any Problems, Then Your Should Probably Keep Away from this Car.  Otherwise, Unless You Have a Serious Heart Condition, Buy this Car.<br><br>
