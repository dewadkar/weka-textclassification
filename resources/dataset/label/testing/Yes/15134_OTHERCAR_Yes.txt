            I purchased my Grand Am in June 1999 with 52,000 miles on it.  I drive it in a mix of city and highway driving and have put about 17,000 miles since I bought the car.

Acceleration
For a car in its class the V6 delivers more than adequate power.  It's no speed demon but the V6 should accelerate the car from 0 to 60 in about 8.5-9.0 seconds.  Furthermore it pulls particularly strongly from around 25-55mph.  At highway speeds the Grand Am is sometimes slow in downshifting from Overdrive and requires you to jam down the accelerator to allow you to pass someone.

Handling
As far as handling goes, the steering feels sporty but the tires grip is only average.  In moderately hard turns the tires will start to squeal.  The ride itself is quite comfortable during highway driving but any bumpy city roads will make the car bounce and drop dramatically.  This car handles well during winters.  I live in the Chicagoland area where there is snow on the ground for most the winter.  The ABS and traction control help greatly when conditions are poor.

Interior
The front seats provide good support and room for normal size adults.  The back seats are fairly tight for adults but are still usable.  The controls are laid out nicely.  The AC, radio controls, etc. are all within easy reach of the driver.   The only thing is the Enhanced Tractions System (ETS) button gets in the way as it is located on the shifter.  I�m sure other reviewers have mentioned this but I like to reiterate the bad position it�s located in and how it�s easy to turn the system off.  The quality of the materials used in the interior is kind of cheap as they used some cheap interior plastic.  Furthermore the trademark Pontiac red dash lighting takes some getting used to. 

Gas Mileage
Gas mileage is about average for an engine of its size.  I get about 20mpg in city driving and about 29-30mpg for highway driving.

Reliability
Most consumer magazines rate the 96 Grand Am as having poor reliability. Not surprisingly I�ve had to bring the car in to the shop a number of times.  The following is what I have had to repair in a 2+ year time period and how much it cost.

Cable to the gas door need to be replaced - $75
Coolant Leak, had to replace the gaskets (lots of labor) - $475
Replace rotors - $200
Replace two muffler clamps - $30
Engine light flashing (replaced battery) - $75

Exterior
Paint job is still rust-free and looks good.  The only problem I have with the way the Grand Am looks is that there are 1000s of grand am�s that look just like mine.
