            This Sony Mavica FD83 is the best camera we have ever had.  I was able to get one at Sears for 10% off - and put it on my account to pay off in 6 months without any finance charge.  This camera takes wonderful pictures even in the 640X480 mode which is what I use most of the time.  I take a lot of pictures to put up on ebay and so selling on ebay is just a few clicks away!!  Take your picture - take out the disk, insert in computer, upload, write ad and bingo you're ready to sell something!!  I also use it 's MPEG feature to send pictures of my granddaughter to her other grandmother who lives 400 miles away.  SHE's loves my camera too!!

I can't recommend this camera highly enough.  You don't need extra ports on your computer - no wires hanging around.  My son-in-law bought a $100 model last year and it's pretty much totally useless - the picture quality is poor.  

With my new HP Deskjet printer and photo quality paper I'm &quot;in business!!&quot;

Try it - you'll like it!!<br><br>
