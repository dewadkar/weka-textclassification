            This is my work vehicle, this is my office, this is where you find me 3,600 miles each month, morning, noon and night.

I work in quarries, where stone is crushed. Our line of work requires a tough vehicle on-site and for high-way driving I need something comfortable and quiet. I need room to haul papers, people, and minor spare parts. The F-150 Supercrew fills these needs well.

On the high-way it's quiet. The ride is smooth, as you'd expect from a relatively long wheel base. Several passengers have remarked positively on the quiet, sedan-like ride. However, it is a little sensitive to winds from the side. Off-road it's okay as long as you stay off the red clay or cross ruts gingerly. I've managed to bend one of the frame cross-braces by over-estimating the ground clearance.

Ford appears to have tuned the engine for "economy". If you really need some acceleration it's there, but you've got to put the "hammer down" hard. The average miles per gallon is 16.5 over 75,000 miles, with about 80% being high-way miles. I have gotten mileage as high as 22.5 mpg. Current cost per mile is $0.50 including the purchase price but not including insurance. I would probably have gotten better mileage with a "longer" rear-end ratio. I chose the "towing" rear-end thinking that I would do more heavy hauling. And speaking of mileage: I miss the option of having two fuel-tanks. With my amount of driving I have to refuel every other day or so. It would have been nice to carry another 20 gallons in addtion to the 22.5 gallon tank that comes standard.

So far nothing major has gone wrong. I've only had to perform normal service and minor adjustments after the break-in period.

Because the bed is shorter even than a "short-bed" I couldn't fit my old toolbox properly into this truck: the larger cab eats into the front part of the bed. I tried cramming the toolbox into the back of the bed, between the tailgate and the wheel wells. Not very aesthetic (that means "Not very good looking" for you people in Rio Linda and Palm Beach County). I ended up trading the box for an A.R.E. fiber-glass bed-cover. I recommend this accessory. Looks good and has improved mileage slightly.

I'd also like to recommend a drop-in bedliner. Some people may swear by the spray-in liners but drop-in liner work better for me as I can divide the bed with boards once the liner is in place.

Seating is comfortable enough with lumbar and support for both elbows. The adjustable pedals are cute, but I'm 6'1" and have no reason bring them closer especially since I wear thick steel-toe work boots all day. If you're a parent, it appears that there are child-seat anchors all over the place. I didn't want the cloth seats or carpet floor because of the dusty conditions of my job, but Ford did not offer a carpet/cloth delete option on this model.


The anti-lock breaks are a great help when I come down red-clay roads. I just wish I'd gotten the posi-track rear-end for going up. Then again, even 4x4's have trouble on red clay.

I am not a fan of Ford's ventilation systems because they don't supply a separate A/C switch.

The steering and front-end set-up has caused me some aggravation. The truck tends to pull slightly to whichever side the road slopes. I spend some effort compensating for this little design flaw. Also, one of the tires have caused some pull, which is not noticeable as long as that tire stays on the rear axle.

As for electric power for all the gadgets, the interior has two plugs in front and one in the rear seat. I also installed a separate 300-watt 12V to 110V power-inverter to power the laptop and various battery-chargers.

Ford has spent some energy equipping this vehicle right. I've found several little features that come in handy: auto power window, adjustable seatbelts, power mirrors, cruise control, adjustable steering wheel, compass, plastic wear panels on the bed edges, and about seven interior lights. One little feature I like in particular is the way the doors keep the mud off the rocker panel. It prevents the back of the pantleg from getting dirty--a most appreciated feature in my line of work. Another touch is the little light under the hood.

The few frustrations with the truck have been mostly self-inflicted like trying to put a older model stereo in, or getting the head-rests stuck because I put them in backwards. Visibility to the rear is poor, as with any pickup. A child could stand directly behind the vehicle and not be seen over the lip of the tail-gate.

I've found out lately that the truck is equipped with a Passive Anti-Theft System, which involves a computer chip built into the key. A spare key costs $20 plus reprogramming which costs $50 if you only have one key left. If you have two original keys left you do not have to take the vehicle back to the dealership to get it reprogrammed for the extra key. So if you think that you may misplace a key along the way, get a third key the moment you get the truck.
