            The DX 3900 is my first digital camera.I've been eye-ing the Casio 16X zoom 2.1 Megapixel but was astounded and couldn't resist this model at the store and purchased it on the spot. It was on an introductory offer of RM1699(US447) at Kuala Lumpur.It came with the 8MB and a free 128MB compact flash card but without the easyshare craddle.

Picture Quality
I'm not complaining.The picture doesn't look one bit digital like those produced by some digital cameras. I've tried at 3.1,2.1 MB and even lower and the pictures are all of superb quality. For e-mailing purpose, I have saved it on much lower resolution (800KB reduced to 200KB) and still the picture remain extremely detailed and natural.Having it over a month and after 1000+ pictures taken it still is a superb camera to own.

One thing I've noted is that the auto picture setting tends to be on the darker side if taken indoors or poor outdoor lighting condition.For this I keep always keep the aperture compensation setting at +1.00 or at least +0.5 to always give it a livelier picture.I prefer to take most pictures without flash as they seem more natural. I've also taken outdoor night pictures with the shutter speed at 16 seconds at that too came out excellent. 


Handling and Picture taking
This is the part that I really pleased. I usually just unzip the camera bag, wear the wrist strap, remove and turn it on, zoom, change the menu setting or go manual and take all pictures all with one hand. The camera feels extremely rugged and compact and fits beautifully into the hand. And since since I've purchased it I carry it to wherever I go I keep doing it none stop. While driving (see a car that I like), while shopping (something beautiful), at the hardware, etc. Even if I can't decide what to buy I would take pictures of the items and bring them home. About 90% of the pictures are usually excellent. The bad ones are usually because of the darker setting and I would immediately retake a shop after adjusting the exposure compensation.

Memory and battery
The 128MB is just perfect for me. I wouldn't recommend anything lower that 64Mb. 128MB compact flashcard works to about 128 numbers of high quality 3.1 megapixel. I always have 2 AA rechargable batteries and 2 at the charger.Works fine for me as the 2 batteries lasts just right for the 100 odd pictures taken in about 2 days and to transfer to the computer. All pictures are taken with the LCD (it much more accurate). 

Cons:
1. Battery life (80% of the time satisfactory)
2. 2X zoom sometimes just won't do. (90% of the time satisfactory)
