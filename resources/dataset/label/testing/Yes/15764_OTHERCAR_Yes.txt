            We bought a 1992 Jeep Cherokee Sport 2WD 4DR in 1995 and we LOVE it!!  Our Jeep had approximately 36,000 miles on it when we purchased it from a dealer.  It now has over 130,000 miles and it almost as good as new.  Apart from a few minor repairs, the upkeep expense on it has been limited to general maintenance.  We bought the Jeep because we had heard and read that they hold up really well to long-term use.  So far, we have found this to be true.  The Cherokee is fun to drive.  The Cherokee respond very well to cornering maneuvers.  Very stable. People considering buying a Cherokee should be aware that there are a couple of drawbacks.  If you are looking for a high gas mileage vehicle, this is not the one for you, unless they have made some changes in the last few years.  Also, even on the 2WD, the clearance for entry is rather high.  Anyone with limitations may have difficulty even entering the vehicle.  This is also annoying if you have small children, which we do.  However, we feel very safe with our children in the Jeep.  One other consideration would be long distance comfort.  Having used our Jeep for many hours-long trips, we have found that the back seat is not very comfortable for extended sitting.  You may need to stop for your passengers sake.  You can pack alot into the cargo area of the Cherokee, however, you need to be careful, as with all SUV's, not to block your rear-viewing area.  Overall, we LOVE our Jeep and would consider buying another one, when our children are older.  <br><br>
