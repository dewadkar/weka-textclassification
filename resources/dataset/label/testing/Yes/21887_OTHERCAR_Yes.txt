            I don't own this car.  My friend owns it.  But I drive it.  So this is just my reaction to the car.  But let me tell you some of my first reactions, and some reactions I still have.  He has a 2000, BMW 540i 6-speed.  The pure rush and power of the pull of that V8 is amazing; I can only wonder what the M5 is like.  It's sliky smooth, the suspension feels like your on air, and its soooooo quiet.

First, lets start outside.  Body is all a matter of taste.  What you like.  I love the big rims, the curved lights, and the silver color on my friends BMW.  In terms of styling, I like the 5 series, much better than the 7.  The 3 series are a bit too small.  In terms of competition, Acura RL for one, it doesn't even come close.  At least the current design.  Its too big, not agressive looking enough.  But in the Beemer, theres almost no gap between the wheel and the body, which makes the car look more attractive.  mmm....

Negatives on outside:  Um...  Nothing really... Not that I noticed.  One I can think of is too much attraction.

Now, inside.  The car is lined with leather.  I personally don't like it, because it makes you slip and slide, and stains.  But in terms of cars with leather that I've been, this has to be one of the best.  Its so nice.  It doesn't stick very well, and it doesn't have that squishy feel to it.  Controls are kinda where you want them to be, not too far out of reach.  Some you have to hunt for, such as the climate control switches.  Rear seat is also very comfortable, almost like front.  All the windows have express features, where you push them all the way down or up to make the go by them selves.  All of them.  The dash is also well laid out, where you can read everything nice.  Tach and speedo stare at you.  Power seats are also nice.  At night, gauges are orange color.  Yes....

Negatives on Interior:  
Well, first, the Germans obviously didn't have cup holders in mind.  They're small, and break eaisly.  The 2 in the back broke.  Oh well.  The stereo sucks.  No bass, I'm sorry.  Also, I don't know if it can or not, but the radar detector is annoying.  Too many falses.  And I don't know how, or if it can be turned off.  I'm sure it can.  But in terms of praticality, its not really that good.  You'll be braking every second.

Ahh, now the really stuff, the powertrain.
V8, 6 speed, a shifter with the infamous bmw M series M on it.  I love it.  You can tell your driving something with some power, cause right away the clutch isn't quite that easy to push.  Shift at redline, go to second, immediate power response and a launching of your butt into the seat.  Such a great feeling...  Or, more conservatively, in 4th gear, step on it, it will still pull.  Highway crusing at 60, nice passing power in 6th so no downshift is needed.  Clutch/shifter action is smooth, very nice.  You know what gear your in, which is important.  0-60 in times of around 5.7 are very impressive for a car with 4 doors and without exactly performance in mind.  And it handles great.  Hug the corners like my Type R, but not quite as weel.  After all, who can out handle a Type R? Heh heh heh.  Brakes are good, good feel, and will stop you when you need them to.  Lets compare to Acura RL.  Right now, the V6 is just no match.  It should be compared to the 3 series.  But thats what the TL is for.  However, with Acura's plans for a V8, things should get interesting.  The Lexus GS-400's are very nice too, and very powerful.  Right up there with the BMW's.  The engine is also very quiet, you can barely tell its at 6,000 rpm.  

Negatives on power train:  
Yes, there are some.  First, shifter throws are too long.  My Integra has a much shorter shift.  And, its too quiet.  I like to have the noise to acompany the car, like my Integra.  8,400 rpm sounds so much better than 6000.  Unless you like that quiet luxury ride.  But I'm sure your passengers will squeal in delight when the feel the raw power of the machiene. 

The BMW is a really, really good car.  It has a big, heavy, but solid built feel to it.  Its smooth, like gliding on air.  The suspension NEVER bottoms out, and is firm, but yet at the same time its riding smooth.  When it corners, no tire noise, the Dunlops are very good, and the car doesn't break loose.  Its got enough room to satisfy you, unless your 6'6 or something.  My friend has had no problems with it.  But, if you don't have the money, or can't afford to maintain it, look elsewhere.  The wheels also get dirty fast, because of the brake pads, so cleaning is also something you should do here.  Unless you like to drive around with dirty rims.  Compared to Audis, I like the BMW better.  The Lexus GS-400 is nice, but it is slower than the BMW, and the one I saw was an Auto.  Auto isn't fun...   But it will out corner the 540i.  But still, I would go with BMW.  A little taste of German Engineering.

It has P/W, P/W, sunroof, cruse, air, traction control, and many other features standard.  My friend has the sport package added, which I THINK includes the shifter and the clutch.  And the rims.  Oh, its nice.  The only better 4 door sedan I can think of is the M5, which is based off the 540i I might add.  I say, if you have the cash and the time to car for your car, go for it and pick one of these up.  Just remember to get it in a 540i 6 speed.  Unless you can afford the M5.  If you don't need the performance, you can probably get the 528, or the 3 series.  But some cars to consider are the Lexus Gs-400, and the Audi S4.  Those are cheaper, by about $8,000.  In the same price range, the Mercedes E class, Jaguar S type, the Audi A8, and the Lexus LS400.  These match in terms of luxury, but they don't even start to touch the performance of the BMW.   The GS-400 and S4 are cheaper, but you get what you pay for.  The 540i sport starts at $54,000, and compared to the A8, the S type, and the ls400, its a bargan.  But the GS-400 and the S4, thats questionable.  Those 2 are very nice cars, and would almost be up in with the 540i.  However, for me, performance is the deciding factor, and the BMW just wins all.  THe GS-400 though, is a very nice car, and would be my 2nd alternative.  Although it is VERY close.  But if you have the cash, get a 540i.  Or even more, an M5.....  <br><br>
