            Last year in February I bought a 1999 Chevrolet Express 1500 Travel Time &quot;Limited&quot; edition Conversion van.  There were only 25 made.  I bought mine for $33,225.00.  It is a &quot;Raised Roof&quot; Platinum Gold edition.  

It has a wood dashboard and wood accents throughout the van.  It has a Television and V.C.P. and 2 6 disc CD Changers.  One in the rear and one in the front.  It is a very luxurious vehicle.  It rides great and tows 2,000 lbs. plus 3,000 in payload.

  This van is very sleekly designed.  It is a little tough to parallel park but it's not any harder that an S.U.V.  I bought this van because I have 3 kids and a lot of their friends to transport around.  I also bought it to be able to go on road trips comfortably to my parent's house and other places.

  Last summer I went on an 8,000-mile road trip and this van was so comfy that we all slept (except the driver) safe and sound.  This van hardly ever makes a lot of noise.  It has a bed in the back for even more comfort.  It has an excellent air conditioner, which is good, because I live in Texas.  Over all this van is an excellent choice and I would never go back and buy another.
