            Alright, so maybe it's not MY car, per se. So MAYBE Mom and Dad bought it for them to use. But seeing as that we have FOUR cars for FOUR drivers, and I use the Altima most often, I call it my own. I'm definitely not ashamed to call it my own, either. In a family of Nissans (my Altima, Mom's Sentra, Dad's Pathfinder, and my brother's brand new XTerra), I chose to write my Epinion on *my* Altima because I believe that out of the four, it fit my lifestyle like a glove...a pretty, champagne-colored, road-hugging, comfort on pavement.

The gas mileage on the Altima struck me as being somewhat average (I can average about 300 miles/full tank on city driving). However, the roominess and comfort of the car really took me aback. I have driven that car just about everywhere and it has never let me down. Its maintenance is practically nil. It is a 98 Altima and it has been in the shop once, for its 30,000 mile checkup.

I don't pretend to know much about cars, nor do I even admit to owning this vehicle. However, it's like a dream to drive this vehicle. The price is very reasonable (at least it was for Mom and Dad), and I highly recommend this as a sort of *first car* for any family wishing to put their children in a safe, comfortable, yet totally cool vehicle. This kind of car is not recommended, however, for stuff-shirt luxuryites. Beamer and Mercedes seekers, don't bother looking. Mad moms in minivans, look the other way. The Altima is coming, and it's only going to stop for the on-the-scene, realistic, practical drivers of my generation.<br><br>
