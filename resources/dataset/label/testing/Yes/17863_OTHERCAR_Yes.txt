               I'll be honest. The last time I enjoyed that new car smell, it came from a can. I've been driving the same vehicles for over 6 years now, and my newest one is now a decade old. Hey, what can I say; I hate car payments!! Recently we took a family vacation to northern California, and not wanting to have the worry of breakdowns (or cleaning out the car when we got back) we rented a Chevy Blazer for the week. I wasn't expecting much in the way of luxury, but I was shocked! That is the most comfortable ride I have been on in years. The inside noise is nearly nonexistent(not counting the kids), and the Delco sound system was incredible. We could actually carry on a conversation in the front seats while Brittany Spears corrupted the minds of my 2 daughters in the back at concert levels. I was especially surprised at the power. It never seemed to be wanting for power, even in the middle of unusually steep and long inclines. You could barely even feel the vehicle shifting down for power. (most of the time the only way I knew it was by looking at the tachometer.) Lots of neat features, nicely designed interior lighting, and generous cargo hold.
   Anyway, I was thoroughly impressed, and when I can muster the courage to face a car salesman without feeling rage, i shall purchase one of these beautiful cars.<br><br>
