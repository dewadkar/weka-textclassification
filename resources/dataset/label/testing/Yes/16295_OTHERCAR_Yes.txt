            It�s true; good things do come to those who wait.  I�ve been wanting a digital camera for some time.  However, I�m not enough of an enthusiast to justify spending $300 or more for a decent mid-range camera.  And I didn�t want to compromise too much on features, as I would have had to do with the cheaper cameras.  So I waited.  And then yesterday, a friend told me that the local Target was selling the Hewlett Packard PhotoSmart C200 Digital Camera for just $179.  I got the last one. Apparently, this model is being closed out.  It normally sells for around $299.

The maximum picture resolution of the C200 is 1152 x 872, qualifying it as a &quot;megapixel&quot; camera.  The pictures I took seemed clear and crisp, even at lower resolutions.  The camera uses 4 standard AA batteries, which I�ve read will take up to 1,000 pictures.  An AC adapter is available, but not included.  However, if battery life is as good as I�ve heard, the missing power adapter is a forgivable omission.   

Unlike some other digital cameras, the C200 has a very nice shape, and feels comfortable in my hand.  It also has just enough weight to feel like a &quot;real&quot; camera.  Many low-cost digital cameras are too light for my tastes.
    
The camera�s controls are basic, but adequate.  You get a few flash options (including a useful &quot;red-eye&quot; reducer), a timer, and an image-quality selection option. The C200 has both an optical viewfinder and a 1.8-inch color LCD.  It comes bundled with an 8MB CompactFlash card that holds up to 80 images.  Also included is a direct video cable so you can view pictures on your TV, or even use your TV as a viewfinder (great for use with the timer in those family photos), and a serial cable for uploading pictures to your PC.  

A catalog that came with the camera offers a twenty dollar adapter that allows you to attach various lenses and filters designed to work on a 35mm camera.

Aside from the lack of a bundled AC adapter, the only negative I can think of is that a bigger memory card would be nice.  However, more memory can always be added later.  A standard 32MB CompactFlash card would let you store up to 320 images!  That should get you through even the longest vacation.  

This camera is a great deal at $299.  If you can get it for under $200, it�s practically a steal!   Check out your local Target, or explore the Web to see if you can get a comparable deal.<br><br>
