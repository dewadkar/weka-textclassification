            My first experience with this camera was from borrowing it from a friend to take photos for eBay auctions.  My friend didn't really know that much about it (and had lost the instruction book), so I experimented and played, and found it was pretty much self-explanatory.  In no time, I was taking great shots for my auctions.  Now, I'm not much of a techie, so if I could figure it out with no book, pretty much anyone else can too!  This little camera does alot of things, including some basic special effects such as sepia tones.  There are indicators to help you decide if you need the flash or not, and you can use the macro mode for closer shots.  The resolution and definition are very good.  There is a video output plug-in, so those who use WebTV's like I do can use the DX-10 too!  How nice to be able to include a family photo with my emails to friends and relatives who live across the country!  It uses SmartMedia for storage, and you can get adapters to enable the SmartMedia to work just like a 3.5 floppy disk in your computer.  AC adapters are also available, which is nice for when you are doing those auction shots at home, and when you're on the road, you can use either AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack.  The only thing missing that I would like to have would be a zoom, but you can't expect everything for the low price.Unfortunately, my friend decided that he needed his camera back, so off I went to eBay, found another one, and bought it!  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could get a factory refurbished camera - just like new and with a manufacturer's warranty, for under $150.00!My investment has more than paid for itself with my eBay sales, and I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is new to digital or just needs a good all-around, compact camera. <br><br>
