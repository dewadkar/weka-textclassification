            I'm not a digital photography afficionado.  As of this writing, I am a digital photography novice.  But I know what I like, and this camera is it.

This review isn't go to be very technical, because I'd be out of my depth, but here's how my experience with this camera went:

I got the camera in the mail (bought it from QVC), took it out of the box, put the batteries in it, started taking pictures.  Point it, shoot it, that's it.

The instruction manual is well-written and I sat on the couch and read through it in about 15 minutes with the camera on my lap.  All the controls are well-laid out and easy to find, and the icons do a good job of telling you what control does what.

After taking some pictures, I went down to my Windows XP Home-equipped PC, plugged the USB cable in the computer and the camera and -- viola! -- I heard a little bee-bop sound and the the camera appeared in My Computer as my G: drive.  I opened it, and copied the pictures off.  I disconnected the camera and I heard a little boo-beep sound and the G: drive disappeared (it does the same thing if you turn the camera off while it's connected).  

I've had the camera for about four months now, and I have never had a problem with it.  It takes beautiful pictures at five different quality levels.  I set it on the middle level, which gives me pictures at 640 x 480 resolution.  I have never taken it off this setting -- never had a reason to (I know, I know -- there's probably some reason to use some other setting, but I don't know what it is...).

You can review pictures on the little viewer screen and delete the ones you don't want right on the camera.

It can also take 20-second video clips, but I can't seem to get the lighting right.  It seems very dim whenever I do it.  Fun to play with, however I have no real use for it.

I have never taken the memory card out of the camera (I actually had to remove it for this review to find out how big it was -- I couldn't find it because I've never had to touch it). All transfers to my PC are done using the included USB cable.

Speaking of things I've never done -- I never loaded any driver software.  The CD that came with it is still sealed.  With Windows XP Home, I just connected the computer and camera with a USB cable, and they started talking to each other.

My only problem is that I get a lot of red-eye.  I have no idea if this is the fault of the camera or if I'm just clueless.  I have it set to the "Reduce Red Eye" setting, but I still get some.  For pictures I want to keep, I do a little image editing and that solves the problem (Microsoft Picture It! is good for this).

I wish I could tell you how many pictures I get on the card (16MB Smart Media), but I really don't know.  At the quality level I'm shooting at, I've had 20 or so pictures on it.  I've never run out of space though, because I can "prune" the pictures I don't want right on the camera.

In the end, here's the bottom line:

If you don't know the first thing about digital cameras and don't want to learn, this is the camera for you.  I can't go into technical details about why this is better than that, but my experience with this product has been utterly painless and satisfying in every respect.

It's like my Honda Accord -- it simply does what you ask it to with no complaints.  It's very low maintenance, very high fun factor.  No worries, just great pictures.  That's all I ask for in a digital camera.
