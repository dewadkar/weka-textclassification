            I previously owned a 1993 Bravada. I was quite pleased with it for what it offered for the time period. However, I also found several areas that could use improvement. When I looked at the 2000 Bravada I was quite impressed with all the improvements that had been made. Such as spare tire now stored under vehicle, front wiper blades able to be pulled out away from windshield, much better handling and smoother car like ride, many added interior features also. 

These include steering wheel audio controls, automatic climate control, sunroof, dual front air bags, vehicle theft deterrent system, daytime running lights, rear cargo cover and net in back, memory controls for the drivers seat, front seats have 2 heating adjustments(these are wonderful for those cold morning startups), 60/40 split rear seats and more. 

So far my only complaint is about the rear wiper washer hole which clogs easily therefore limiting its use to clean the back window.

It is night and day difference driving the 2000 compared to the 1993. It is much smoother, less noise, better handling and a few more miles to the gallon. The seating is comfortable front and back. The all wheel drive is a blessing that takes no extra effort on the drivers part. The whole instrument panel and console layout is user friendly and within a comfortable, if any reach. I spend a good deal of time in my vehicle and appreciate the comfort of the seats including the lumbar adjustments. 

If you are looking for good mileage do not purchase this vehicle. You will get between 15 and 18 miles per gallon. If you want something small and jack rabbit fast, it is not for you either. However, if you are looking for durability, style, comfort, good pick up and an all around pleasure to drive vehicle, then test drive a Bravada today.<br><br>
