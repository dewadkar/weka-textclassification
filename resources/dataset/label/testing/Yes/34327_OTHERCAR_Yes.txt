            If it weren't for a couple sore spots, I would really love this car.  

First, there are squeeks that I cannot locate coming from the driver' seat and center console.  I have sprayed every conceivable moving part on the seat and seat belt and it hasn't helped at all.  

Also, there is this annoying ticking sound which comes from the right front tire whenever I make left turns.  The dealer has been unable to locate the origin of this noise.

The remote control for the door locks, seems easily disabled by interference from TV broadcast antennas.

Which brings me to the last sour point of this car....  The dealership.  Pflueger Acura's poor service and attitude has really made us regret leasing an Acura.

Those points being made, we otherwise love our car.  The engine never seems to run out of power.  It makes running simple errands a joy. While the automatic transmission does a great job, it still hesitates at times, and that is when it is really fun to be able to manually shift the gears with the sport shifter.  It would be even more enjoyable if it had a bit wider tires, as the stock tires lose grip a bit early.  However, since most of our driving is in a straight line, we are hardly ever affected by this.

The car is absolutely loaded.  Leather, Bose stereo with CD, sunroof, xenon headlights, plus others are all standard.  It does not have the  disk in-dash cd changer as the later models do, however.

All of the controls are where you would expect them to be.  The audio controls on the steering wheel are very convenient.  

The stock 3.2 TL's look a bit bland, but our's came with the optional body kit and spoiler which really help in giving it a sleek sporty look.  The only drawback with the body kit is that we sometimes scrape the front when coming out of a driveway.

Overall, we would recommend the Acura 3.2 TL, but just not from Pflueger Acura which has a monopoly to the brand in Honolulu, Hawaii.
