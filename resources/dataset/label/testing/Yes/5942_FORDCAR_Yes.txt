            The 2001 Ford Expedition is a Sports Utility Vehicle that gets you noticed.  It's big, it's bad, and it turns a few heads when you drive it.  This beast also causes others to stop and gawk when you go to parallel park into a tight space, for that matter...  But in reviewing the all-around package the Expedition delivers, it goes anywhere you need to go on pavement and sometimes off pavement, it is rugged yet quite humane in its driving characteristics, while still quite thirsty at the gas pump (no shock there).

What led me into buying an Expedition was the falling prices of 2001's in making room for 2002 models.  At the time I had owned a 2000 Ford F-150 Supercab truck and the transition from an F-150 to an Expy was easy: nearly identical layout of the dash and interior from the front seats up, and the same chassis, powerplant and other mechanical components.
  
How would this vehicle work for you, you ask?  If you are the type of driver that needs 4-wheel drive for the winter or other conditions, if you tow something large, or if you need seating for 6 and feel too "rugged" to drive a minivan, then this is a well-suited match.  Just be sure to read the window sticker and make sure the options you want are there.  

Some of the options worth detailing in my opinion are:  the sport package gets some upgraded upholstry on the seats, 3rd row seating, and rear climate and stereo/headphone controls.  Also, a big one for me is the 30-gallon fuel tank.  The CD-changer in the center console is a nice touch, as are heated rear-view mirrors.  I prefer the metal "nerf-bar" step-up running boards as compared to the plastic ones Ford is using on some of its trucks/SUV's.  But the BIGGEST misconception is the engine.  Get the 5.4L V-8 as opposed to the smaller 4.6L V-8.  Even the F-150's with the smaller engines have to continually downshift on inclines.  (This is due to the ultra-low RPMs at which the vehicle cruises at while in overdrive.  A slight incline will cause the RPMs to drop and the automatic transmission compensates by downshifting to the next-lower gear to compensate.  The result?:  higher revs, more engine noise, AND lower fuel economy...).  Imagine the added weight an Expy carries and a 4.6L is simply not enough to handle a full load or tow without annoying downshifting into that lower gear on hills.  Even empty, you WILL notice this.  Granted, I still get the occasional downshift in my 5.4L Expy, but not NEARLY as much!  How much for the bigger engine? A measly $700.00.  Go for the big dog, and thank me later.  It only took me 2 trucks with the 4.6L V-8 to figure this out...

So what is negative about this vehicle?  The size is that of a full-size truck with a cap.  Yes this is not a small vehicle.  Some drivers feel intimidated by the size of this vehicle.  The solution? a test drive.  Drive it and make up your mind.  It's the only way to be sure...  [Dare I say] a minivan may be more appropiate if you do not need 4 wheel drive.  But I'd rather put 6 adults in an Expy as compared to a minivan for that matter!

Your fuel economy can fluctuate between 12-16mpg, and fill-ups at the gas station in a 30 gallon tank at $1.50 or more for gas can be quite an unexpected shock (yes that's $45 to completely fill the tank!).  But remember what you are buying: a truck-like SUV that swallows 6 people and struts along the road with the demeanor of an angry bull.  In comparison to a full size truck (the F-150 to be exact), the Expy handles BETTER over bumps and rough road surfaces.  I attribute this to the greater weight of the Expy.  The truck-like bouncing and rocking that may cause car-sickness is virtually nonexistent, and the plushness of the ride is almost carlike.  This is due to the work Ford did with the front suspension.  Test drive an F-250 truck with the older front suspension and see what I mean for comparison's sake.  But this was supposed to be a section of negative points, not a defense of potentially negative points.  I just have to admit that this is one of my "dream cars".

If you live in the environment where you need 4 wheel drive and want more than a truck, if you want a rugged vehicle that has surprising subtleness and comfortable amenities, or if you want to simply get something larger than the mid-size SUV you have now, then the Expy is a good value.  Right now 2001's are being cleared out and you can get a great deal if you shop around (such as 6,000 off sticker for example).  Which brings me to the point of those who drive trucks because SUVs are so "overpriced".  Not now my friend, the SUV you always wanted might be within reach.  So if you can deal with the size, and look beyond the gas mileage, you will own a vehicle that will be a benchmark for all others to follow.  That is just my opinion, but after owning 11 cars (2 F-150's, a Dodge Grand Caravan LE, a Passat, a  Mustang convertible, 2 Tauruses, and an Explorer to name some of them) in the last 7 years, I hope you'll take my word for it.  Thanks for reading and good hunting!
