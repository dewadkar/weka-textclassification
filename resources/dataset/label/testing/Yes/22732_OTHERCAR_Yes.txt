            A couple of years ago I wrecked a truck that I had grown quite accustomed to.  The truck was a Ford Ranger STX 4X4, and it was the perfect truck for a high school grad like me.  However, I wrecked my truck coming home from school one day and I thought I would never love another vehicle like my truck.  That was before I sat in the driver's seat of a Grand Am.  Its aerodynamic design and comfortable seating makes for a relaxing ride around town.  With a surprisingly powerful V6 engine, the Grand Am is quite responsive on the road and has the braking capacity to match.  Excellent gas mileage is yet another feature that makes this an ideal vehicle. Even the stereo system is more than satisfactory and is in no need for professional replacement.  
The only fault that I have experienced with the Grand Am, is the wear of the brake shoes.  Though my driving may have some effect, it seems that the brake shoes and drums of this car wear quickly, but never to a dangerous point. 
There is no need to look any further.  If you are looking for a reliable, attractive ride, you are looking for a Pontiac Grand Am.<br><br>
