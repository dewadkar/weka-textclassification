            A bit of background: I work in an electronics store, and I have the opportunity to play with a host of different digital (and other) cameras all the time.  This one I own, as it was given to me by my dad, who got it free with his motorcycle.

I've never really taken pictures or gotten into photography, but ever since I've had this little gal, I've started to take more and more pictures and created a website to showcase stuff I photographed.

However, I'm no serious enthusiast, as I would not have been satisfied with this camera, even though it was given to me.  It doesn't offer a manual mode, and lacks some features other cameras in the price range have, like a movie mode.

The resolution is enough for anyone just looking for quick shooting and normal format printing, as well as those primarily using the camera to post pictures on the Net or keep them in the computer.

The lens does not let a lot of light in, but the flash compensates reasonably for that.  Don't think of using it outside at nigh though.

The menus are easy to understand and work through even for newbies, as there aren't a lot of useless functions to clutter them.

The camera is obviously very small, fits in any pocket, even though it is pretty heavy for that kind of usage.

The zoom is 3X, which isn't much but seems to be standard on this type of camera.  Don't even think of using the digital zoom, it's crap, but that's true of all digital cameras.

It uses compactflash cards, which are more expensive than their smartmedia counterparts, so factor that in your purchase, because, as always, you will have to buy a bigger one than the one included.

The autonomy of the battery is pretty bad, it won't even hold up to more than 3/4 of a day of heavy use with the LCD on.

This camera is discontinued as of this review's date, so I couldn't really compare it to others, even though you could probably get a better one (on the used market) for the same price, sacrificing the compact size for better/more features.  You definitely don't get professional or serious amateur-grade optics in such a camera, we live in a world of compromises.
