              I was always an avid fan of taking pictures, lots and lots of pictures.  With this digital camera you can take as many as you like without it ever costing more than the camera itself.  The original SONY DSC-F55 Cybershot is absolutely the BEST digital camera on the market for general and advanced, even high quality use.
  When I initially went to buy a digital camera I was extremely disappointed with the lack of the use of STANDARD image resolutions.  The bulky sizes and irregular shapes of the digital cameras on the market are also undesirable.  When I saw this SONY camera in the case, It looked perfect, but when I bought it and really got to use it, I found out that it was more than I ever expected.  Quite simply, the perfect digital cam.  Allow me to summarize.
  First of all, when I said it had standard image resolutions, I mean that the camera uses all of the regular screen sizes that are standard on most PC's.  It's lowest resolution, 640x480, is a smaller, but convenient quality for up close facial shots.  Many people also use 640x480 for their Windows screen, so you can take a picture and use it for your Windows wallpaper.  800x600 is a slightly better medium resolution, which can be used for higher quality images while still fitting many images on your memory stick.  1024x768 is very high quality and the next most popular resolution used for Windows wallpaper.  Last, but not least is 1600x1200, which is an extremely high quality image resolution which is good for full page prints, and/or more detail in your pictures.
  These four image resolutions are great, from medium to extremely high quality, and it is nice to have standard sizes like 800x600, rather than the irregular sizes such as 558x330 that some camera's use.  The higher res, such as 1024x768 and 1600x1200 are also great for real photo prints.  Simply place the photo's you want developed on a floppy and send them to the photolab.
  The size, weight, and feel of the camera in the hand is by far the best I have experienced.  It allows your left hand to rest nicely without your fingers getting in the way of the lens, while your right hand has a natural grip on the controls and trigger buttons.  The real bonus of this camera is that the lens swivels from front to back allowing you to hold the camera comfortably no matter what picture taking situation you may be in.  When in reverse, the picture flips over on the screen allowing you to take pictures of yourself as well.
  The camera has all the features that you should expect, and a few more.  It has built in flash, rechargeable battery, high and low quality file save, effects such as Black&amp;White, Sepia, and 15 second MPEG video mode.  It's serial connection allows you to e-mail photo's and video's.
  Transfer of the pictures from the camera to the PC is easy.  Either you can hook up the serial cable and transfer them to Picture gear, or as I prefer to, simply remove the memory stick and place it into my SONY laptop directly and it reads like a disk.  The Memory stick can also be placed in a special diskette, or a PCMCIA card for other laptops.  Memory sticks now come up to 64MB allowing you to take hundreds of pics on one stick, and devices of all kinds are now available to read the memory stick.  There is even a SONY mouse with a slot in it to place the memory stick for your computer to read.
  You can not go wrong with the SONY DSC-F55 digital camera.<br><br>
