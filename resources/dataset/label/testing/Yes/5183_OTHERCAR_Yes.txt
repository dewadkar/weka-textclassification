            Have you ever heard the saying, &quot;You only get what you pay for&quot;, well, in the case of the Honda Accord EX V6 Coupe, you definitely get much more than what you pay for.

In the summer of 1998, we began shopping around to find a sporty replacement for our little red 1993 Honda Del Sol sports car.  We just about considered everything from the Toyota Camry to various sport utility vehicles and just couldn't justify the purchase of any other vehicle, i.e., dollar for dollar, option for option that compared to the Honda Accord EX V6 Coupe.  On top of that, this model retains sports car looks and performance...  At last, someone has built the perfect car for yuppy baby boomers!!! 

After approximately 16 months and 21,000 miles of ownership, the absolute reliable nature of this vehicle has shown through again and again.  In short, the only service required to date has been the recommended 3 month oil change interval.  Our local Honda dealer claims that the basic engine need not be tampered with for 100,000 miles.  

As far as economy, this V6 runs on regular unleaded gas and gets around 24 m.p.g. in daily commuter driving situations.  Not bad for a 3.0 liter V6 automatic... I previously owned a 1994 Accord EX 2.2 liter VTEC 5 speed that averaged 26 m.p.g. in overall driving and without all of the smoothness and reliability of the V6.

The performance and in particular, the excellent acceleration offered by the VTEC 3.0 liter V6 engine coupled with the state of the art automatic transmission with grade logic would have to rank near the top as one of the major reasons for our purchase.  Handling and braking are superb with the standard 16&quot; alloy wheels, sport tuned suspension and four wheel disc brakes, although not quite the kind expected in a purpose built sports car.  Ride comfort is excellent in the 8 way power leather drivers seat and ergonomics are exceptional for a car in this price range. Steering wheel controls for the high end stereo system with integrated CD, cruise control, excellent interior lighting,  integrated garage door opener, alarm, remote entry and power sunroof top off some of the goodies included in this package.

In summary, the Accord EX V6 Coupe is the perfect every day all season sporty drivers car that can be driven to the country club, an important business appointment and the shopping center all in the same day and fit in comfortably in all situations.  It's luxurious and appealing enough to pass snob scrutiny at high level social occasions as well as comfortable and sporty enough for those looking for a purpose built sports car substitute. The Accord V6 coupe reminds me of the 1965 Mustang that I owned years ago, because it has all of the appeal of a classic chameleon that does everything right and in my opinion is destined to be a classic.<br><br>
