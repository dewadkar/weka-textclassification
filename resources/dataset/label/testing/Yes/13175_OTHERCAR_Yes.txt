            Nice styling, excellent comfort, good road manners and the appointments you'd expect to see in this class.  I found the 210 Horse Power engine to be sufficient for the day to day driving, however more zip would be helpful when passing on a grade.  Transmission shifts (4 speed automatic) are smooth and concise.  Anti Lock breaks are mature and work very well on snow and icy roads.  The Traction control system is better than those I have tested on other cars (Oldsmobile, Hyundai).  The Bose 6 speaker 6 disk stereo system is excellent, although I would like more than the standard 200 watts.  In the 12,500 miles I logged on this car it had zero problems.  Not one hiccup or glitch.  In short this is a reliable vehicle.  The ride is smooth and controlled until you hit about 110mph.  At that speed the suspension becomes a little soft and the car begins to float on the road. On long drives the seats are comfortable for about the first 10 hrs of driving, after that you will be looking for that rest stop to get out and stretch.

My only dislikes with the car are as follows: (1) The break pedal and gas pedal are too close together.  If your feet are larger than a man's size 10 (US), be careful which shoes you wear when you drive, they could get stuck.  (2) The power windows switches are located poorly.  They are in front of the door handle and can take a little getting use to if you have large hands.  The back back seat is a bit small for larger people. I'm 5'10 195lbs and found it a little small back there.
