            A few days ago we (my family and I) bought a used Toyota Camry. The year model is a 94 and it looks practically new.  These days it doesn't really matter what year you get if the car looks nice because each year the model doesn't really change that much. Anyway, before I got my Camry, I drove a 91 Ford Tempo. Needless to say, my car is much appreciated now.

Talking more about the car it is an automatic, &quot;gold package&quot; with a sunroof and all those nice added things.  The mileage is very low to be 6 years old and the car runs wonderfully.  For the size engine it has, this car sure &quot;gets up and goes&quot; which is something I look for.  It gets great gas mileage and is really good for trips. I've been lots of places in my car since I like it so much so I'm already pretty well aware of it's great qualities.  All around I'd say this is a really good car. It's everything you could want.  It looks nice, runs well, and hasn't ever had any problems with its previous owner. If you're looking for a nice used car that's not too expensive, a Toyota Camry is something you should look at.<br><br>
