            	Our Malibu is a '97 which we bought used with just a few
thousand miles.   We bought it because it's a great value - similar
cars the same size cost thousands more.  Very comfortable, even
without power seat, for both tall and short drivers (have rented
power seat models - even more comfortable than our manual seat!).
Huge legroom in front with seat pushed all the way back, better than
many larger cars!  Many standard features - we liked ABS and generally
safe feel compared to smaller cars for the same price.
	Recommend the optional interior with fold-down rear seats.
Ours has nice fold-down arm rest in middle of back seat (may be
eliminated on 2000 models - not sure, but it's nice to have in a
car this price).
	The 4cyl has plenty of power, but fuel economy seems worse
than 6cyl Malibus I have rented.  We only get low-20s on trips (75mph,
mostly flat terrain), but diagnostic computer finds no problem with
engine (runs fine).  Economy is biggest disappointment - worse than
my '91 Taurus Wagon (3.0L six) - but Malibu feels a lot quicker.
The transmission seems very refined - shifts at just the right times
without &quot;hunting&quot; for the right gear.  Instrument panel layout is
very nice - all controls easy to reach and use.
	We have an early model from first model year, and have had
annoying little problems.  Brake rotor problems are common on this
model - ours have been cut once, then replaced - haven't warped again yet,
thankfully.  The battery failed at 10k (just bad luck, I think),
otherwise there have just been a lot of squeaks and rattles, some not
yet resolved.  All Malibus I have rented (there have been many) have
a problem with the seat adjuster on the passenger side rattling when
no one is in the seat, and several have a rattle from above the
left rear passenger door.  All early models like ours seem to have a
problem with the routing of the seat belt warning light wiring, at
least on the manual seat models.  The glove box doesn't quite close
tightly.
	But overall it's a lot for the money, and probably newer
models have some of the initial bugs worked out.  We have not had
serious problems, and the dealer has been  good about trying to fix the
little things, even though this was a used car.  We used Chevy
800-number road service once (for dead battery), it seemed responsive
and helpful.
