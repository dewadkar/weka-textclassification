            I simple love my big D. Towing my boat is a dream! I travel between Chicago, Il and Minocqua, Wi 4 times a year. Each time I tow a big boat, 3 bikes, and a bunch of camping equipment. I also take the beast off-roading. When I shift it in 4wd part time, nothing can stop me. I went to Colorado - as a previous jeep owner I used to frequent Camp Jeep, I obtained a lot of trail maps - and let me tell you my Durango handled them like my Jeep Wrangler. This totally surprised me.  Nothing else can handle like the big D! <br><br>
