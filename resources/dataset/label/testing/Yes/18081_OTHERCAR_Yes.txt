            I have had a Neon Highline 4-door since 1996 and overall I am pleased!  Although my wife hates it with a passion because it makes here nautious but she has excuses for everything...another story!  I will admit these cars have a notorious history with head gasket and electrical problems.  Although a nuisance, every dealer I have been too has fixed the problems with NO cost to me!  Others have had to shell out $800 for new head gaskets and I say HOW could you possibly pay for something that should be under warranty anyway!  That is just plain stupid!  I am real envious on how the 2000 models look as they are even sharper than the 96's.  Makes me want to trade it in for the new one but Hey only 1 year left on my car note.  I say go for this peppy little racer!  Chrysler sponsors a racing series for the Neons and also produce a racing version of the Neon with the roll cage and all!  I wish I could only get one of those!<br><br>
