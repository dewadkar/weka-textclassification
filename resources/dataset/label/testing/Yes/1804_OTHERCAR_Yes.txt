            It's a shame that Olds is dropping a good car. We have had the Cutlass for almost a year now and WOW, if we had known that it was not &quot;my grandfathers car&quot; sooner we would have been driving one instead of the imports. It is better than the 1996 Mazda 626 and the Nissan Altima before that. More of a solid road car with better get up and go and road handling capabilities. The big surprise was the 30 miles to the gallon at 70 mph this summer on a trip north, averaged over 2800 miles. (Ft. Myers FL to Indianapolis IN and back) All the fit is great and no mechanical problems of any kind (12,400 Miles.We tell all that listen what a great deal the Cutlass is and will continue to do so for years to come. Thanks Oldsmobile.<br><br>
