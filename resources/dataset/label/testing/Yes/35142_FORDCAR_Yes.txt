            I had always had such bad views of Fords in the past, until I drove one.  My first was an 1989 Ford Mustang and I now I have just recently purchased a 1999 Ford Escort (and the Mustang is still running, mind you!).  I was a bit leary at first and had really thought that I would not end up with an Escort, but I have been pleasantly surprised and become more confident with my decision everyday.

I was able to get a fully loaded Escort for a great price by waiting until the 2000 where released and taking advantage of the rebates that Ford had to offer.  So I got a few extras that I didn't consider essential, but are fun anyway (Premium sound with a 6-disc CD player).

There are really very few things that I can truly pick apart, even when I sit down and really try.  The most noticeable of all is the engine sound.  It is definitely not the quite hum that most people would be looking for.  It was even more apparent after I test drove a Ford Contour of the same year.  This lead me to believe that it was not just the typical sound of a Ford, but something that was special to this vehicle.  It is something that I can easily overlook though (especially since I usually blast the Premium sound system anyway).

The only other blaring draw back that I have noticed is the leg room for the back seat passengers.  As long as you don't have Michael Jordan driving, your fine, but put a good sized person in front and the people in the back seat are eating their knees. 

Everything else has been more than satisfactory with this vehicle since the day I drove it off the lot, including the after-sale service that I have received from my dealer.  The mileage I have calculated is better than the sticker states and for a little 4-cylinder car, it really has some get up and go.  I also just got to try it out on snow and ice and it handles very nicely.

I think Ford has a winner when it comes to the lower price model.  This is a great &quot;starter&quot; car!<br><br>
