            As a company vehicle I received a 1997 dodge caravan, and let me tell you, this van can take abuse.  I generally put on about forty thousand miles a year, and these miles are the tough ones.  The van stays outside all year, and it always starts up without any problems.  I have the basic caravan, with a/c, two sliding doors, cruise control, and beefed up suspension.  The van is far from being loaded, but what do you want for 19k.  This baby goes through anything, and feels rock solid on the road.  The van drives better than most cars on the road today, and you can haul around a lot of stuff.  I have other cars, but when i'm just driving around the van comes in handy.  The van drives great, is pretty good on gas, has good power(get the v-6), and has everything that you need in a vehicle.  Dodge is always giving deals on these vans, so you should be able to buy them new for less than the invoice price.  All in all this van has not let me down yet, and i will be getting a new one very soon!<br><br>
