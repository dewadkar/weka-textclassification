            I have used a lot of cameras before and I can tell you that this is a totally family orientated camera.  It has all of things that the family could use and a little bit more.  I would choose this over all cameras for the family because it is so simple that even you kid can use it if he wanted to.  The quality is off of the wall for quality and it is very nice.   I have used other cameras and this one is the best I strongly recommend it in more way than one.   But if I had to pick a camera it would be a Fuji camera because they have a lot of nice stuff without all of the hype that Kodak has.<br><br>
