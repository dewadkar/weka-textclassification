            After driving a sports car for 3 years (Camaro), I was ready for a larger vehicle.  Interior space, horsepower and cosmetics were the most important factors for me when I was looking for an SUV.

In my search, I considered the Honda Passport, Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Isuzu Rodeo and Nissan XTerra.  Notice that the Pathfinder isn't in that list.  We were actually test driving the XTerra when we asked the salesman to take us for a ride in the Pathfinder, just for fun.  I wanted to see what the new 240 hp engine was like.

Curiosity quickly turned into desire.  The interior was much more plush and luxurious, the ride was firm, the power was incredible and the looks were sleek and sophisticated.  The price however, also retained all those values, and suddenly we found ourselves in the 30k price range!

Oddly enough, the Honda Passport EX-L is extremely comparable to the Pathfinder SE.  If you added 40 horsepower to the Passport and refined  it's interior, you'd be driving around in a Pathfinder.  And since the Passport's price tag is about $5,000 less than the Pathfinder, budget-minded buyers might want to consider this car.

So, you ask, &quot;why did you get the Pathfinder?&quot;  HORSEPOWER!  I couldn't live with myself if I didn't get the car with more power.  If you read the reviews about past model Pathfinders, you'll notice that the overwhelming complaint was that 170hp engine wasn't satisfying enough.  Nissan fixed it by converting the Maxima engine to the Pathfinder; even including some new improvements (such as an aluminum engine block).

I've owned this SUV for a month now, and it has been an absolute joy to drive.  

Among all the great things about this SUV, here are my favorites:
1. the leather and associated interior is very nice
2. the Bose sound system was custom-designed for the SUV, and it's excellent -- no need to replace with aftermarket parts
3. the power/torque is such that I don't miss having my old sports car
4. the exterior is simple, yet sophisticated

Complaints:
1. the remote keyless entry doesn't have a button for the rear door
2. the steering wheel audio control only seeks forward, not backward
3. the horn sounds wimpy (nothing a $20 air horn can't fix)
4. 6 disc changer takes a long time to switch disks
5. the gas mileage leaves something to be desired, but I didn't buy an economy car, did I? ;p

People say that the XTerra is taking away from the market that the Pathfinder is in.  I disagree.  The XTerra rides &amp; feels like a truck, the Pathfinder rides &amp; feels like a car.  It's that simple.

If you're considering an SUV import, make sure to drive the Passport EX-L, Montero Sport and, of course, the Pathfinder SE.<br><br>
