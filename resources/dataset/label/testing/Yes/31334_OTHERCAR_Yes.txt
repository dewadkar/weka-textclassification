              I purchased my LHS when it was four years old, had 40,000 miles on it, and I paid $11,000.00. It is now eight years old, has 100,000 miles on it and I love it.
  Yes, the water pump went out. Yes, the Air Conditioner has had problems. Yes, I replaced the Timing belt and rocker at the same time the water pump went out.
   My wife and I have driven the wheels off of this car. It has a sport suspension, 214 horsepower, and it will cruise town or the highway with no effort at all. It accelerates very well, takes curves like they were straight, and with antilock brakes will slam to a stop and still allow you to steer around any thing in front of the bumper.
   The 1994 LHS comes with a number of amenities, a huge trunk, seats five adults quite comfortably and will turn heads at eight years old, as if it were just produced in 2002.
    Where else could I have possibly purchased a luxury sport vehicle with leather interior, cruise control, electric six way bucket seats, power windows, power door locks, reasonable sound system, traction control, heated power side mirrors, fog lights, remote trunk release, collapsable cup holders, upgrade interior trim, antilock brakes, 3 way electric moon roof, electric retractable antenna etc, all for $11 grand.
    I purchase leased vehicles when I buy. I find that, even with the repairs I have made, I have saved money over the four years, verses buying a new automobile. Cost, insurance and maintenance requirements.
    The LHS is just like any other consumer product out there. No matter how perfect you want it to be, it will have particular faults. My personal opinion is that all parts grow old, and some parts will fail. Pay to make the repairs and get back to the pleasure and fun of driving this car. I am now preparing to put the second 100,000 miles on mine and I have no shiny new car payment, reduced insurance costs and a lot of highway to explore. Even if I spend $2000.00 bucks to maintain my LHS this year, that is far less than I would have to pay in payment and insurance for a luxury automobile of this level. Get one maintain it, and drive.
