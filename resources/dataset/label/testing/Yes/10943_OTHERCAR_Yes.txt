            This is the first BMW I ever bought, and i have to say that I really have never driven a car that is more fun to drive, than this one.   The handling is fantastic, and the features that BMW puts into it shows forethought, and anticipates needs.

The areas I think BMW could improve on are some of the quality control concerns, and the Navigation system.  The quality control issues relate to little things not working correctly on a consistent basis.  My biggest gripe is with the moonroof.  On some occasions the one-touch works fine, on other occasions, I can't get it to work even manually.  The other area that i have concern over is the navigation system.  As much as I love driving BMWs, I have to say that they have the worst navigation system of all the luxury cars out there.  Unfortunately, I have come to this conclusion after reviewing all the navigation systems out there, finding that Infiniti actually has the finest.

Other than these two gripes, I love this car.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to being a very luxurious car, this car is a lot of fun to drive, and that's where the real pleasure of being a BMW owner comes in!
