            Satisfaction has a lot to do with expectations.

My budget for a digital camera was nonexistent. I started looking at really low-end stuff like the JamCam, Agfa ePhoto Smile, and the Nickelodeon Nick Click but they all got trashed in the reviews. While the Dimera 3500 doesn't get stellar reviews either, few people trash it. And then I noticed that many people paid in excess of $100. Had I paid that much, my opinion might be a little harsher too. However I found a new one on eBay for $60, not much more than what I might have paid for the Nick Click toy, yet this is a real camera.

The Dimera 3500 is perfect for my purposes, i.e. sending pics with email, posting pics on my website, and letting my 12-year-old daughter start taking her own pictures. I find the low-resolution mode to be too grainy and shoot everything in fine resolution (640x480). It's fast and easy. The built-in automatic flash does a surprisingly good job.

The software that came with it is a bit confusing so I'm using my twain-compatible scanner software (Paperport) to download the pictures.

Bottom line, this camera will do the trick until I can afford a nice $500+ model.<br><br>
