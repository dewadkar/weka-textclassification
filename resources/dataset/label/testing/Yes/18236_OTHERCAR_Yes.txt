                 When I purchased my pre-owned 1995 Volvo 850, I was sure that I had made a good decision.  I chose to get it in black, an excellent choice, with a beige leather interior, a must!  The Volvo safety record should be able to please even the most nervous driver.  It comes standard with driver and passenger air bags, and a side impact protection system (SIPS).  The body is well constructed and holds up very well in a fender bender.  The engine is very suitable for someone looking for something with a little power, yet the car achieves good gas mileage in heavy traffic.  The dash is well engineered, and the premium stereo system is top-notch.  For anyone looking to purchase an affordable pre-owned automobile, the Volvo 850 is an excellent buy.    <br><br>
