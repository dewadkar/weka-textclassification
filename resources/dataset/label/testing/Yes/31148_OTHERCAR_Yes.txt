            I've been fascinated about cars and racing ever since I saw my first race when I was six.  Even since then, I've been trying to find my dream car.  I'm very realistic, I know that I can never afford Ferrari.  I looked in the foreign market for answer.  Of course you would think Nissan Skyline would be my choice, and to tell you the truth I like Skyline, but I already set my eyes on NSX.

Under the hood, it houses a 3.2L V6, 24-valves DOHC+VTEC engine, with total roughly 290 ponies under the hood.  Good acceleration, great traction and control, and fine braking with ABS.  Even its slim and fashionable body design, in some way, resemble a Ferrari F-40.

If you are considering to buy a sports car simply for showing off, this is the car for you; if you are buying a sports car for the performance, this is the car for you; if you are like me, just want a dream car to admire, this is the car for you!  Beside the slight problem with the price, you should find this car to be an excellent choice!
