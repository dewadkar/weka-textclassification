            The Dodge Durango simply has 'more power!' This car can withstand the competition, with it's towing capacity of 2500 pounds this car is a lean, mean, driving machiene. The fuel enjected V8 magnum engine gives the durango it's growl in the wind, rain, sleet or snow. The car has exceptional capabilities in wet weather, coming down hills and on off road terrain. The reason I like this car is simple, it's affordable. It has 7 seats and the most powerful engine anyone can buy. It has a great look from the outside, and it's spacious interior is finnese. The only problem with the car is it's truck like ride, but thats okay, becuase the car is based on the Dodge Dakota. Go buy a Dodge Durango, you won't go wrong!<br><br>
