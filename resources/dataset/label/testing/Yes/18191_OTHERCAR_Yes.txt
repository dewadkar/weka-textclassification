            It's time to turn in my leased 1996 Pathfinder.  This SUV has been a great starter family vehicle.  We leased it (new) when I was pregnant with my first child and needed more room for baby and a large labrador.  Although it was a bit pricey, the sports package (running boards, roof rails, sunroof, etc) was worth it.  The Pathfinder is really fun to drive! I love the fact that I don't feel like I'm driving a truck even when in 4 wheel drive!  This is a great SUV if you don't have more than 2 children or need to seat more than 3 passengers.  The back seat does tend to get tight if three people are seated.  This SUV holds up very well in accidents.  We survived a head on collision with minor injuries and very repairable damage to the vehicle.  Gas consumption is very good compared to other SUV's.  Handles very well on ice and snow when using four wheel drive.  I am sad to part with it but have outgrown the space.  If Nissan could come up with a third seat in a larger version of the Pathfinder, I would be in heaven.<br><br>
