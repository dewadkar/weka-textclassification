            I must sound like a salesman every time I tell someone about our Grand Caravan, I love it. We pretty much decided on a minivan when we went car shopping since we had a six month old and found our old four door sedan just wasn't big enough for the accessories necessary to transport a child. We were also planning on a second child before two long so we knew we needed more room. 

I talked to people with minivans and researched consumer reports and pretty much decided on a Grand Caravan before we went to the first car dealer. We test-drove several Grand Caravans, I wanted the larger size for both the luggage space and because I can fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the back and close the door. We looked at both new and used Caravans and decided on new because one of the few problems with the Caravan is the transmission. We wanted the extended warrantee to protect us from transmission problems. 

We did get a little lucky. My wife wanted a Champaign Colored Caravan and was calling around to dealers. We found one with everything we wanted and more. When we arrived at the dealer to look at the car, not only was it pretty well loaded for an SE, but also it had been customized with running boards, great for the kids, a wood grain dash, and a built in TV and Video Cassette Player. We have family and vacation 500 miles from our home and the TV has paid for itself many times over.

We got a great deal and could not be happier with the car. It drives like a car not a truck or van. It can easily hold all the supplies necessary for a two-week trip to the beach. It is great for picking up wood and supplies for projects at the local home improvement store. And it�s fun to drive. 

I have always laughed at the commercial on TV of the guy at the gym when they announce someone in a minivan left his lights on. I used to think like that guy. Now I�m considering buying a Grand Caravan for myself in a year or two when I�m ready for a new car. 

The Grand Caravan is perfect for families but I strongly recommend it for anyone not looking for something along the lines of a sports car. It is roomier and a much better value than any SUV. It has the utility of a pick up without the limitations. Two girls and countless Barney videos later, we are happier with our Grand Caravan then the day we bought it. I would have never thought, but I am now a Minivan Guy. If you drive the Grand Caravan, you may be too.
