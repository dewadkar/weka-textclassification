            I own a 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager that is &quot;nicely equipped&quot; in the car dealers vernacular: power windows/locks/mirrors, air conditioning, V-8 engine with overdrive automatic transmission, stereo cassette radio, separate climate controls for front and back.  It now has over 14000 miles on it, and overall, I would have to say I'm satisfied with this vehicle.  As you might expect, for people hauling purposes, it has no peer, with the seven passenger standard seating package - and that's a very comfortable seven, since we've done it with seven adults on a two hour drive with no complaints!  And when our two adult, two kids family takes the occasional overnight drive to Florida from Pennsylvania, the flattening middle seat and fully reclining rear bench makes for a very sleepable full size bed (with plenty or room to spare for luggage behind that third seat, since it's the Grand Voyager model).  The drivers seat could be a little more flexible and adjustable for those long drives, but the car-like handling combined with truck-like vantage point high in the traffic lane make this an absolute pleasure to take on those long drives.  With its substantial weight, front drive and ABS brakes, it's also real roadworthy on snow and ice - even my Louisiana born wife has had no problems getting to work in the snow.  Gas mileage is not great, but not bad either, and very acceptable on those long trips due to the overdrive transmission - that standard tachometer never goes over 2300 RPM at pretty quick speeds: 80 MPH.  My major quibble so far is that big bugaboo of all vans - mysterious rattles from the back.  In our case, we've isolated them to both of the sliding side doors, but I have no idea whether they will get worse as the vehicle ages.  The rest of the car is tight and quiet.  Oh, and did I mention its cargo hauling abilities?  With the two rear seats out (and they really do roll out easily - a one-person operation) you can haul the proverbial 4'X8' sheet of plywood, and some other pretty bulky items; you won't believe just how big that rear area gets when you need it to!<br><br>
