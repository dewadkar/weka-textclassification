            I had been wanting a digital camera for a while. One day in a local Sears store, I saw the DC215. Regular price was $399 but this day it was on sale for $299 and there were only 2 left. Just trusting in the Kodak name, I bought it without doing any research to see if it was what I really needed. It turns out that it is a great camera and very easy to use. The only thing that was disappointing to me is that the next day I had gotten a Wal-Mart sale paper that had the same camera package at the everyday low price of $299. So much for my fantastic bargain. Anyway this was great for everyone else.
The camera was easy to use right from the box. About 10 minutes of looking over the booklet, I was ready for my first picture. You can change your settings to get 10-50 pictures on the 4 MB card. The choices are good, better, and best. I get great pictures on the good setting.
The software that comes with the camera is Print Shop Photo Pro, which pretty much explains itself. You can also use the warp setting to have fun making your friends look like aliens.
It did not come with an ac adapter but it did have the batteries (4 AA's).
The ones in the box only lasted for a few pictures but then I replaced them with new ones which lasted for about 70 pictures.
If you are going to use the camera for home pictures or maybe online auctions, this is a great one to have. <br><br>
