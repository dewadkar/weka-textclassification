            As I pull up in front of my friends house, he stares with amazement across my new car and exclaims, &quot;I thought you bought an Accord.&quot;  The new generation of Honda Accord coupes has transformed the automobile industry's perception of the sport compact car.  With its stylish curves and its NSX sporty rear, this car turns heads.  Best of all, the Accord offers excellent gas mileage, VTEC standard, and large selection of models to fit any driver's preference.  I purchased the most inexpensive model, the 4 cylinder VTEC LX coupe and have never been disappointed.  Buying it for just over 18k, I was able to take advantage of this car's endless array of after-market products.  Upgrading its wheels to 17&quot;, adding sport springs, and a cat-back exhaust, my Honda out-looks and out-performs any stock car under 20k.  As for the Toyota knock off, the Solara, it lacks the simplicity and perfection which my car holds.  For any consumer who wishes to purchase a built in the USA, sporty, quick, and comfortable automobile with Japanese reliability, look no further than your local Honda dealership.<br><br>
