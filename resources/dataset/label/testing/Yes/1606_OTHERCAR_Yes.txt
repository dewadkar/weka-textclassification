            My mom desperately needed a TV stand.  Not an entirely true statement, but the fact was, I had bought myself a new entertainment unit (are they still called that or does it have something to do with media now?) and she decided SHE just needed something new for her little TV to sit on.  So, we loaded up in my work truck.  At the time I owned my own landscape business (before I got smart and went to work for someone else!) and all I had was this durn work truck that usually smelled like mulch - or worse!

On the way to the TV stand store (who knows where that was going to be) I headed in the entirely opposite direction.  I was gonna get a car.  I hadn't owned a car for years and hadn't owned a new car for even longer.  Somehow, this all made sense to me.  In addition, I wanted a Saturn.  I thought they were snappy - hot - fast - spirited ... everything I didn't need so of course wanted.  I stopped at the Chevy dealer.  Not where you normally find a Saturn, but after all, I was only after a TV stand anyway so what did it matter where I shopped for a car!

Bought the first Geo I drove.  It was an automatic, it was green.  I wanted a red, stick shift Saturn and I ended up with a green, automatic Geo Storm.  Six years later I am still driving that darn Storm.  No, truthfully, this is my second one.  The first one had only 2200 miles on it when some TROG ran a stop sign and broadsided me, smashing me into a fire hydrant.  Complete testimony to the structure of the Geo - there was not a solid piece of the automobile left - front, back, sides.  No windows, nuthin!  And nary a scratch to me.  The infrostructure held solid and firm.  The interior of the car remained pristine.

Being in a quandry and not knowing what to do, I contacted my dealer and of course bought another Storm.  Coulda scored that Saturn that time too, but didn't.  Of course, I was under the impression the Saturn was too expensive, but seeing I spent $15,000 for that Geo, all things relative, I coulda got the Saturn.  This time I got the stick shift but ended up with the same green color (by the way, it is Polynesian Green for your info).  In fact, most people I work with did not even know I got a new car since they looked the same.

Now I know this site is dedicated to information on products and I figure I am the best one to give information on this auto since I know NOTHING about cars.  I have driven this guy for 6 years now; 61,000 miles.  My upkeep has been replacing the tires, changing the oil and flushing out the radiator (none of these things I do myself), gas and window washer fluid.  In six years I have probably put a total of $300 into the car aside from general upkeep (oil, etc) and am still on the original battery.  She has been faithful and diligent and even with her little 4-cycle engine (I think) she has pulled me through the Smoky Mountains and over the Blue Ridge Parkway many a time.

The only problems I have with the car - extended trips, the seats get a little hard on the fanny.  They are bucket seats but not a lot of padding.  The backseat is non-existant.  Don't know why they even bother to call it a back seat, but when I lay it down, it makes a great truck!  I can haul 15 bags of mulch, 6 bags of topsoil and a few plants (a little hard on the braking though).  I find the brakes, though not needing replacement, constantly make noise and need blown off (their term, not mine).  Also, the car drives too fast.  Entirely it's fault.  The ride is so smooth under normal circumstances you do not realize you are speeding until the bubble light behind you lets you know.

I have had no problems with the little guy (we call her the Barbie car) and no maintenance or recalls from the manufacturer.  Pick up is a little slow but she does a fine job once she gets in 5th gear (too good some times, as I mentioned).  It handles the curves fine and the pulls on inclines do not stress the engine.  The air-conditioning unit is adequate for the size of the vehicle and the original sound system is still fine although I think I am in the process of blowing a speaker (Melissa Etheridge's fault, by the way).  All in all, a decent car for the price.<br><br>
