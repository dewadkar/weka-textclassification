            We purchased a 5-speed 2000 Kia Sportage almost 7 months ago.  One of the main reasons we decided on this vehicle was because of the affordable price.  It is plenty high enough to get through the flooded roads where we live.  Other cars will be stalled out on the side of the road, but the Kia gets through the water with no problem.  The Kia handles very well and is very easy to drive.  The seats are high and comfortable.  There is plenty of leg room, even for tall people.  There is plenty of cargo space and the back seats fold down and flip forward for added room.  The spare tire is on the back of the vehicle, so no room is lost for carrying cargo.  It is very comfortable on long trips.  The Kia gets about 30-40 miles per gallon.  Anyone who wants an SUV that is affordable should buy one.  They are great if you have children also.  I would not trade mine for any other vehicle!<br><br>
