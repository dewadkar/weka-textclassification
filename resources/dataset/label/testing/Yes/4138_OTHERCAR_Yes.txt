            I had a 1989 Legend Coupe that my husband restored after buying it at an auction.  The front was smashed but it ran like a dream.  I then smashed it up, in fact, I crashed it twice...and each time it was fixed..it was perfect again.  

I never had a day of trouble with my Acura.  When we found out we were having a child we went right to the local Acura dealer and bought a brand new 1995 Acura Legend.  I drove that car to more than $95,000 miles and the only service it ever needed was regular oil changes, brakes and tires.  I was never stuck in snow..I was never stuck anywhere.  The car was beyond comfortable, extremely reliable and good looking.  


We have since moved on to a mini-van as our family is expanding...and it was very difficult for me to give up my Acura...you can be sure when the Legend Mini-Van comes out I will be first in line.  Or when our children are a little older and we don't need as much room, I will be getting myself back into an Acura.  I could not have been happier with a vehicle.<br><br>
