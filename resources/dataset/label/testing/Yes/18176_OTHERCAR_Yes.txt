            I purchased my 1992 Bonneville in July 1995.  We were looking for a used car, and found it on a Chrysler dealer's lot.  They were more than happy to get rid of it, and the 3 year old 45,000 mile SE model cost us about $13,000.  I am horrible at wheeling and dealing, so that price and the add on service contract sham was what we got worked over for.  My previous car was an '83 Cougar, so this was a dream ride in comparison.  In fact, even as a 3 year old car then, and as a 9 year old car now, the suspension has delivered a very smooth stable ride.  I am not putting it through stunt car maneuvers or trying to break the sound barrier in it, but I do dog the transmission from the many highway entrance scenarios and it has held up well.  There is excellent acceleration with this basic "SE" model.   

It did come with 16-inch alloy wheels and a little spoiler piece attached to the trunk, and it does have a leather interior, which took some getting used to.  It had the original factory set of Goodyear GA radial tires on it when we purchased it at 45,000.  We replaced them with Goodyear Aqua-Treds at 60,000 miles, which took us another 60,000.  This current tire set is about a year old.  The 16 inch tire width further stabilizes the Bonneville's wide stance, and the my confidence in cornering and on wet surfaces has improving substantially.  The roominess makes it popular among our family and friends for group outings.  It's the airport and church limo of our set.  There are is ample room in the back without scooting up the front seats, robbing the front seat occupants of it.  1992 was the first year of that dramatic Bonneville body style change, and it held that shape for the most part until the year 2000.  For a 9 year old car, the '92 still looks like it's more recent.  It helps that my model has a white exterior and no body damage.  It cleans up very well.  We aren't embarrassed to have it brought up to us in front of a crowd, like in a restaurant valet situation.

On the negative side, after a bad lightning storm years later, we have had problems with the electrical system, and it has defied many service attempts.  Theory has it, the after-market alarm installation was faulty, but all was fine for 3 years until that storm.  It is just intermittent enough to act deceptively normal at the service center.  The current bug is after we shut the car off, wait two minutes or so, the interior lights come on for a moment, then off.  No one knows what to do about that.   Also, in heavy rain storms, water gets in to soak the driver's side floor.  We can tell it's coming from way up high under the dash.  Whether its rolling in off the windshield or via the vents between the hood and windshield connected with the A/C, we don't know.  We do know that the money it would take to pull out the whole dash to investigate further is not worth it if the current market value is as low as 6,000 dollars.  It really has to rain hard the better part of a day to leak in, so we live with it.  Consumer Reports gave the '92 Bonny bad marks in it's Used Car charts for the electrical and for the brakes. Our front pads keep wearing, but I am as lead footed on the brakes as on the accelerator, and we are not runaway model sized passengers. It has passed inspection every year without fail.  I always use premium grade gas and change the oil on time.  Other age related work has been done, such as a replaced alternator and water pump.  These are minor prices to pay for the pleasure of out living the car loan.
 
With the mileage now around 128,000 and 7+ months of no loan payments, we are not looking for a permanent resting place for it any time soon.
