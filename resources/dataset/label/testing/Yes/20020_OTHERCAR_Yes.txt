            Dear reader I'll be concise,I have two digital cameras one very expensive and a Chameleon,the latter one I bought because of it's outstanding features and for the price.I take it everywhere it's easy to handle and to carry it's very small,I think that for a David in size it's a Goliath of a camera.
There's a lot of great features in this camera like 8 megs of internal ram(more than others with a higher price),you can shoot 88 images and the batteries are still going another good feature micro photography,it's great for the internet and to save them in diskettes,it's software is good so am sold on it as a second camera,I use it everyday.
My son started in photography just a few months ago so I got him one for Christmas,can't write no more I think this is too long.
Thanks for your time.
