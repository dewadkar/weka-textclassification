            i've wanted to buy a jeep wrangler for many years.  i finally bought one 2 years ago and have had a lot of fun with it.  it's probably one of the most affordable 4WD vehicles available today.  mine cost just over $16K.  i live in the washington DC area and don't have to use 4WD too often, but it's nice to have when it does snow because that they don't do a great job of clearing the roads around here.  

probably the one thing that drew me to the wrangler is the soft top.  it's a great feeling to be able to put down the top during the spring and summer.  for those who have never owned a convertible before, there is nothing like hitting the road with the top down.  it's the american way.  it's a little more complicated to get the top down on the jeep than on other cars, but trust me, it's worth it.  it's also worth noting that Jeep has done a nice job in recent years cutting down on the draft and on wind noise.  it's still not quiet, but much better than it used to be.  keep in mind that the jeep is not a secure vehicle and i would not recommend keeping things inside. 

gas mileage is just OK--i get about 20 miles a gallon, so if looking for something that is fuel efficient, this may not be for you.<br><br>
