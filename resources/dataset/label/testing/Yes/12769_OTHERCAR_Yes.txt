            I have always considered myself a car enthusiast, so when I turned 16 I wanted to make sure that I had a &#147cool&#148 car.  To achieve this goal, I got a job when I turned 14 at the local movie theatre and saved most of the money I made.  Two years later I was ready to buy a car and my search began, I looked at everything from Corvettes to RX-7s.  Six months and probably about 25 cars later I ended up looking at a 1993 Dodge Stealth.  I fell in love, the price was good, insurance was reasonable, and it was front wheel drive (I live in Colorado, so rear wheel drive cars are troublesome in the winter).  I bought the car on the spot from an older lady who had driven and maintained it well, with exception of the interior, which was pretty beat up.  

I have now owned the car for about three years, since then I have perfected it, the interior, exterior, and engine run and look as good as if they were new.  It spends most of its time in the safety of my garage; I have only put a little under 5,000 miles on it since I bought it (I have a 93 Saturn SL2 as my daily driver).  In this time I have never had any troubles with it.  One of the best things about this car is the fact that it doesn&#146t look as old as it is and it also has the ability to turn heads.  People often ask me what year it is, when I say that it is a 93 they are shocked and tell me that they would have guessed it to be only a couple years old.

The car has a reasonably comfortable interior, with exception of the useless rear seats and the harsh ride.  However, this part of owning a sports car, if you want a comfortable ride this is not the car for you.  Part of the fun of driving these cars is sitting low and feeling every imperfection in the road, this makes you feel like you are more in control of the car.  The rest of the interior is made comfortable with climate control, and the stock infinity sound system with six disc changer sounds good too.  

The 24 valve dual overhead cam V-6 is responsive and provides plenty of power while producing a pretty nice tone as it exits the dual exhaust (it actually has four exhaust tips but it is not all functional so I still consider it to be dual exhaust).  I have had no troubles with the engine.

I like to keep cars original, so everything in my car is factory original and I have done no aftermarket engine modifications.  The only thing that I have done to the car is I replaced the half moon spoiler with the spoiler off of a 95 3000gt (for those of you who don&#146t know the Dodge Stealth is twin to the Mitsubishi 3000gt).  All though this is not completely original it looks as if it is.

The only disadvantage that I can think of about this car is the lack of knowledge about it from Dodge dealerships.  If you need to have any questions about the car answered you are better off just going to a Mitsubishi dealership because odds are Dodge won&#146t know anything about it.

I would recommend this car to anyone; it is a good looking, fun, and reliable car that won&#146t put a big dent in the wallet.  After I bought mine two of my high school buddies bought Stealth&#146s too.  One of which is a 95 with only 9,000 original miles, it is in perfect condition, but mine with close to 100.000 runs just as well as his does, so it seems like they hold up well.  If you buy one that has not been well maintained however I hear they can be a nightmare but this is true of any car.
