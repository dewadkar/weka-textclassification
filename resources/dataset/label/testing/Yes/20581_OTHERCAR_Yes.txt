            The Audi A4 is not the most impressive car to look at, and it generally does a great job of blending in with traffic, and ususally doesn't attract attention to itself, that's somewhat unfortunate considering the fact that this is a well-priced automobile that performs quite nicely.

Here's my usual breakdown of a car review:
The Drive:
I have driven this car with both the automatic and manual transmission, and I must say I'm heavily biased towards the manual. It seems like Audi did not spend a large amount of time perfecting their Automatic as it's shifting sequence is somewhat abrupt and unrefined, and it often shifts at inopportune times. Additionally, the shifter itself feels quite cheap and flimsy. The 5sp manual on the other hand, feels very smooth. The shifter could be slightly more precise, but each gear engages very smoothly. The clutch is a little heavy, but it's very easy to get used to. 
The engine (2.8L) has power, but it has to be revved significantly to get any of it. It also sounds a little loud and unrefined. 
However, the car handles the road superbly. The quattro awd system enables the car to stick to the road even when bad weather strikes. The steering is linear and responsive. The suspension does a nice job of absorbing bumps, but also handles the car well when spirited driving is desired.
Overall, the car drives well, and with a more powerful engine, it would be a real pleasure to drive. (See the Audi S4)

Interior:
In general, this car's interior feels a lot like most European cars do. Most controls are refined and appear to be well-crafted. Most panels lined up nicely, and the fit&finish of the interior seemed to be high in quality. The climate control systems can be somewhat confusing at first, but as with most things, once you get used to them, they're easy enough to operate. Same goes for the stereo system, which does produce high quality sound.
On the negative side, however, the interior does feel somewhat cramped. Although there's plenty of leg & head room, for some reason, the interior felt cramped to me.

Exterior: The car is nicely styled. It's conservative but not outdated (it's getting there though.) It blends into traffic quite easily, but is still aesthetically pleasing.
