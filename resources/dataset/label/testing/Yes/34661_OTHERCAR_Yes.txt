            I have driven SUV's all my life from Toyota to Jeep to Ford to Lexus and not one SUV has ever been able to meet the same luxury standards or the sheer capability of the 2002 Range Rover. There is absolutely nothing that this vehicle cannot handle. 

After serving 7 years in the US Army, I have spent a lot of hours behind the wheel of a HUMMWV (Military version of the Hummer). Until recently I have felt that this is the most capable vehicle ever built. My opinion is now changed. Not only does the Range Rover seem to be able to handle the terrain better, it is done in complete luxury! The air suspension system is state-of-the-art and adjusts on the fly. Even if your chassis gets caught "high-centered" for some reason, the vehicle detects this contact and takes it up an additional 1.5" to extended height (cannot be manually accessed) allowing you to clear the obstacle. 

The navigation computer is Off-Road Enhanced which allows you to enter in waypoints to plot your course. And guess what? Unlike On Star, you own the system and do not have to pay to use it. Updates are sent to your home address ever 6 months. The sound system is the best sound system I have ever experienced with 460 watts of pure audiophile heaven. The boys over at Harman Kardon have out done themselves on this 12 speaker system. The system has a six-disc CD changer located conveniently in the cargo area. The features include a Tape Deck, 12 memory FM band, 12 memory AM band and auto-seeking weather band. The Digital Signal Processing allows you to alter the virtual "center" of the sound, depending on the number of vehicle occupants as well. The bi-amplified subwoofer and advanced speaker materials make this system rival that of the finest home sound systems. The volume is speed sensitive which allows the volume to adjust automatically to cover what little road noise there may be. The steering wheel controls are clean and convenient. One other feature that I should point out is that when a navigation instruction is audibly given (in a pleasant British accent mind you) the instructions play through the front speakers allowing the music to continue playing to the rear speakers as not to disturb your passengers. If you have a phone call come through the car phone the different sound outputs are given priority to the logical speakers as well.

The climate control is a true dual-zone system that constantly monitors the interior and exterior ambient temperatures, solar loading, vehicle coolant temperature and road speed to select the optimum combination of air temperature, air distribution and fan speed. You may also have up to a 10 degree difference between the driver and passenger. The filters on the system block out the smallest of contaminants which will be appreciated by allergy suffers during high pollen days. Another great feature that will be truly appreciated in Colorado is one-touch windshield and side window defrosting. This pre-programmed feature is tuned to direct just the right amount of air to these windows as well as heating the front and rear windows and side mirrors from within the glass heating filaments.

Some additional comfort features include 10-way power front seats can be adjusted to an infinite number of positions. The power adjustments, including power lumbar support, are augmented by two-person memory for both the driver's and front passenger's seats. And the remote entry system can be programmed to adjust the driver's seat and outside mirrors to your selected settings when the door is unlocked. Even the headrest is automatic. The front seats are heated and you are surrounded by leather and wood everywhere. Even the center console/armrest has an ingenious 4-cup cup holder that can hold two different size cups. The armrest also has a large storage area. All controls are conveniently located and all windows, to include the sunroof are single touch open and close (the rear seat windows are only single touch down). A tilt and telescoping steering wheel allows numerous adjustments. A three button HomeLink controller is located above the driver's door. The rear view mirror dims automatically to reduce the blinding affect of car's headlights.

The vehicle is rock solid on and off the roads and handles quite well on the turns for an SUV. The vehicle is constantly adjusting itself to keep the car level whether you are making turns or going up inclines or going down descents. When you have driven over 50 MPH for more than 30 seconds it will lower the profile of the vehicle for better handling and aerodynamics. The drive is whisper quite and you have a great angle of approach view of the road. It is always in 4-wheel drive as well. The vehicle has a very sophisticated traction control system called 4ETC. What this means, for example, is if the ABS wheel-speed sensors determine that the right wheel is starting to spin faster than the left wheel, 4ETC "pulses" the brake on the faster-spinning wheel. This slows down that wheel so it can get a better grip, but it also allows power to flow across the axle to the slower-running wheel. It all happens in microseconds and it's totally automatic. 4ETC continuously monitors the speed of all four wheels and compares the values. It also compares front-to-rear wheel speeds. It's like having a highly sophisticated limited-slip device on each of the three differentials. The 4ETC works in all gears, high and low. The Range Rover's 4.6-liter V8 engine puts out 222 HP with a robust 300 pound-feet of torque at 2600 RPM. You can also pull up to 6,500 pounds in High Range or 7,700 pounds in Low Range with the standard tow package.

When my wife and I were looking for a new vehicle, one of the most important considerations was safety with the soon to arrive baby on its way. We were impressed with the dual front and side airbags as well as the seatbelt pre-tensioners. The vehicle uses 14-gauge boxed-section steel frame to add to the structure's many safety features. All four 18" wheels use huge disk brakes to quickly bring the vehicle to a stop. Even the hand brake is unique. When engaged, it activates a brake on the transmission output shaft - effectively locking all four wheels.

One other very cool feature is the vehicle's security system. When you put the vehicle into "superlock" mode it disables the exterior and interior door handles and making the vehicle even more theft resistant. The Perimetric system assures all windows and doors are closed and deadbolts all doors. Then Volumetric sensing uses ultrasonic devices in the passenger compartment to detect untoward motion, like a window breaking (Not good to do if a dog is in the car. It detects movement and will scare the heck out of your dog for sure). The security code resets after each use as well. One thing to point out, don't loose your key. It will cost you $200 to replace!

One piece of advice, this vehicle is obviously very expensive. However, if you want the best and most luxurious SUV ever built it is worth every dollar. But if you are not going to take advantage of its capabilities off-road, I suggest you stick to a luxury sedan. This vehicle is meant for a certain type of person who will only accept the best and will not settle for less. One last thing, when you go into the Land Rover dealership expect a buying experience like no other. Just another part of owning the best SUV on Earth!
