            This is a pretty good camera for the money which boasts a number of usable features. 2.1 pix and interchangable memory cards make for an easy way to get lots of snapshots at a reasonable quality.
<p>
I use this for taking everyday pictures of my daughter and other family stuff. It's not a serious photographers camera, but few digitals are at that point yet. You NEED to purchase the larger memory cards. Mine came with a 4 MB one and I immediately bought a 16MB, which somedays is even to little at 1200x1600.
<p>
The controls are good, easily understood and placed well. The camera itself fits naturally in the hand, though is a little large to carry around everyday/everywhere. A friend of mine has a Canon S10 (i think) which is way smaller and a no-brainer to flip in your pocket.
<p>
Though I haven't run into a problem with the battery life, I can see it being a problem... I always charge the thing the night before I know I will use it to be safe and usually the day/night will end before the battery does... though conservative use of flash is needed.
<p>
Also not sure about the durability... though it looks like a metal casing, it's really plastic... and feels like it'll break with even the slightest mistouch.
<p>
The one thing that really bugs me about this is taking snaps with the flash... there is a way noticable delay between initial flash and actual picture... compounded when the red-eye reduction is on (double flash essentially). So the subjects move, thinking the picture is taken, and the pictures end up blurred. Perhaps it's inexperience at digital photography, and I will play with settings and whatnot to see if that helps, but it's annoying.
<p>
Overall, it's a good unit... and has paid for itself in the memories captured where they wouldn't have been with a regular camera (too much bother to load film, reload film, take for processing, etc).
