            I have had my Honda CRV for ~ 6 months now.  I wanted an SUV, but was put off by the bulk of the Explorers and Blazers, and cannot afford a Lexus.  So, I purchased the CRV.

The car has much more room inside than I had anticipated.  It will carry 4 adults and their golf clubs easily.  The Suzuki Grand Vitara would not.
The ride is smooth and not as &quot;trucky&quot; as I thought it would be.

I liked the looks of the CRV from the moment they hit the market a few years ago.  The interior passenger area is nicely furnished, and the CD player on the EX package was a good choice.  

The only complaint I really have is that I'm not happy with the 4-cylinder engine.  It seems underpowered, especially when the air conditioning is running and you drive up a hill.  The engine revs pretty loud when you push the gas pedal aggressively to get the power you need.
