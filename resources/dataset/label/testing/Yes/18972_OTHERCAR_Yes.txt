            I love my 1996 Trooper. The driverï¿½s controls are properly located for ease and comfort. The back seat is very roomy and comfortable for car seats and adults alike. I prefer the design of the Troopers swinging cargo doors as opposed to the tailgate style. The Trooper is easy to maintain under the hood with fluids in easy reach. You have plenty of power from the V6 for hauling or towing. Power at a price however the one complaint I would have is Gas Mileage. I would expect better Gas Mileage from a V6 but the weight and low gear ratio of the trooper cause gas mileage to suffer. Aside from gas mileage The 1996 Trooper is the perfect vehicle from my family with small children.<br><br>
