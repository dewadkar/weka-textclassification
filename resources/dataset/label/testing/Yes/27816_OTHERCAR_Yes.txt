            This is my very first Digital camera and I am very impressed. I read all the reviews and magazines and set out a list of features I would need and not need and the S-100 fit all the criteria perfectly.
All my friends want to touch and see the camera due to its small size and I don't need to worry about them damaging it because of the solid steel body. 
The camera takes clear pictures that can look professional grade with just a touch-up on Adobe Photoshop 6.0.
The only negatives to the camera are the weak flash and small memory card that is included in the camera package.
I use a slave flash to supplement the camera and upgraded to a 64MB Sandisk in place of the puny 8 MB and never have to worry about running out of space.
