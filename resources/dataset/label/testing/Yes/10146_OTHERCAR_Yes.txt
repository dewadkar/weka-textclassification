            The 2000 model year Pathfinder LE, 4 x 2, auto trans, is an SUV that lives up to expectations.  Build quality is excellent.  The number of defects found on my LE after delivery was zero.  The monoframe construction provides an exceptional ride - rivaling Mercedes (ML320) and besting Toyota (4Runner).  And the fuel economy on mine is as estimated by the EPA - ranging overall 17.4 to 18.5 MPG after 1200 miles on 87 octane fuel.  The current 3.4 liter V-6 engine has a very good low end torque curve but is somewhat conservative.  It definitely leaves something to be desired in top end acceleration .  This vehicle would benefit from a bigger engine. And Nissan has indicated that it is planning a change in late Spring, early Summer 2000.

Everyday driving is a pleasure with no trim noise or rattles and it handles well in heavy traffic.  The disc/drum brake configuration performs well and the ABS kicks in as expected on really quick stops.  Cruising at 70 MPH is no problem.  Wind noise with the sun roof open (20 - 50 MPH range) even with a wind deflector installed is louder than expected.

The Bridgestone tires balance out well and are quiet on dry pavement. This SUV handles wet roads well and has enough clearance to easily push through 6-8 inches of standing water.  

The dash instrument lighting offers a cool visual effect - lite color backgound in daylite and darker at nite. Ergonomics are good - most things are laid out very well.  The cruise activation switch location on the dash leaves something to be desired. 

This 4x2 SUV handles well on the beach in all types of sand and goes off road in fields and on dirt roads well enough.  It's tight construction produces no rattles and the rear wheel drive comes out of loose packed sand quite well.  The 4-wheel drive option is definitely recommended for rock climbing and serious back country trips.

The Bose stereo is a really good sound system but not quite up to the same level of performance found in other Bose equipped vehicles.  Sound separation is not as sharp as in the Corvette or the Maxima.

Overall the 2000 Pathfinder offers excellent build quality, nice ride and a trouble free driving experience. <br><br>
