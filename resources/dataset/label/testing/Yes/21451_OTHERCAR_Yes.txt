            <p>I am leasing a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS, exactly the same make/color as is featured in the picture above.  My lease will expire in one year. I'm paying $330/month including taxes for it and I'm pretty happy with the car overall. I got it brand new.
<p>This car is very much concerned about looking good and to that end it succeeds.  Heads turn and girls smile and all that  good stuff but beyond that,  the eclipse falls short when it comes to delivering solid performance.  In my area, there a lot of pendejos driving the types of cars featured in the movie "The Fast and the Furious" -- modified Honda Civics with spoilers and I'm assuming CO2 injectors and I do not even try to compete with them because it takes about 8 seconds to go 0-60 in the GS. Maybe if I had the GT I would contemplate racing them but not in this car.
<p>Additionally, I have noticed that this car makes various rattling noises like an old used-car would. I am not sure why that is considering it's brand new and ideally should be well-greased or whatever. Maybe Mitsubishi spent too much time designing the exterior and neglected the interior.  You can tell there is a lot of cheap materials making up the inside of the eclipse.   
<p>But don't get me wrong, overall this is a great car. I love to drive fast and that is when the eclipse shines.  (no pun intended)  When driving very fast, the spoiler helps out in keeping the car stable/balanced. Any sudden movements of the steering-wheel are counter-balanced by the aerodynamics, etc.  I've done 125mph in this car and it handled the speed very nicely.  I have also made very sharp turns coming off the freeway going very fast and I'm obviously alive to tell you about it. The car is very heavy and has a low center of gravity thus it is possible to make sudden turns. Also mine is a manual so I can further play with the gears -- downshifting when necessary to pass.
<p>My friends always assume that because the car looks so sporty it has low fuel efficiency but they are wrong. The eclipse is very fuel-efficient because it only has 4 cylinders and 147 hp.  A full tank will carry me approx 400 miles on the freeway and the size of the tank is, from what I recall, 14 gallons which works out to roughly 30 miles/gallon. 
<p>The eclipse is also a very durable car.  Last week, I got into a small fender-bender on the west side highway in New York City. I was stuck in a traffic jam when some idiot driving a PT cruiser pressed the gas pedal instead of the breaks and bumped into me.  I knew he hit us pretty hard because my head hurt afterwards however when I came out of the car to examine the damage--there was none.  Additionally there are plenty of airbags inside the car and the doors have a ribbed stripes that both give the car style points as well as create several extra inches of space to protect the passanger/driver from a side-collision. 
<p>Inside, the car is roomy for the driver and the front seat passanger. The backseat doesn't offer much comfort unless you are very short. The visibility is ok but could have been better. I have never gotten into a serious accident but I do wonder sometimes if I am seeing everything in my mirrors. There were times when I had looked out, failed to see anyone and later realized that there was indeed another car right next to me. I haven't figured out the best configurations for my mirrors to see everything.  
<p>In the winter, the car doesn't drive as well but that is more due to the fact that it's a manual with rear-wheel drive. There were times when I could not make it over a hill. I have luckily never rolled back. Also the car is equipped with anti-lock breaks and a traction device--the computer will monitor the conditions of the road and if it can detect that one tire is spinning faster than another a light will come on and the car will also attempt to stay stabilized. Because of all these checks and balances I have never "spun out of control" in the winter. 
<p>When it comes to actual functionality, the car is flawless. I have never taken it to a mechanic. All I have to do is change oil every 3k miles. I might need to change the front tires but that's because I drive like a maniac.  The car always starts up from the first time even in the dead of winter. The car has very good breaks too, and they never sqeak.
