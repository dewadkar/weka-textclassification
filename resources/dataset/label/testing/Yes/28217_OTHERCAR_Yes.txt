            My family has previously bought a 1999 Dodge Durango with the SLT Plus package.  We love this truck.  The great things that Dodge has done with the Durango are that they made a big truck that was affordable and is very fun to drive.  With the 5.2 Magnum Powered V8 engine, the truck has great acceleration and tons of torque for anyone who wants to tow a mobile home or a boat.  The Durango also comes with a more powerful 5.9 Magnum Powered engine but i recommend buying the 5.2 because you will be gaining a little more gas mileage.  As it stands now we are getting about 14 MPG are town and about 16 MPG on the highway.  
The SLT Plus package that we went for came with leather seats, an 8 speaker Infinite sound system with CD/Cassette/AM-FM(it sounds amazing), and a third seat in the back that folds down.  When my parents bought the truck, they were told that the SLT Plus package will greatly boost the re-sale value of the Durango.
Lastly, I would like to say that in my eyes the Dodge Durango is quite possibly the best SUV on the road.  It is not to big, not to small and has a lot of great things going for it.  That is why I highly recommend taking a look at the Dodge Durango...
