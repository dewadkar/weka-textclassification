            I bought my Cavalier in 1995 when it had 45,000 miles on it. It was literally love at first sight after a long and tedious day of rejecting vehicles. I was then a very anxious and inexperienced driver, but felt comfortable as soon as I sat behind the wheel.

In the five years that I've had my car, I've brought the mileage up to a little over 110,000 miles, and it's still going strong in spite of three accidents. Two of those were quite minor, but one sent my car careening through a wire fence. None of these accidents have caused damage to the engine or me.

The brakes work consistently and wonderfully. It's also very cozy and snug inside, which is fine for me, since I'm short. However, when particularly tall friends of mine have driven my car, they seem to be less comfortable. One other problem is that the driver side blind spot is a little hard to see around, but I adjusted to that very readily.

The only major problem I've had was a glitch in the alternator, at about 85,000 miles. The alternator was then rebuilt, and has not given me any more problems since. The only other problems has been that the windshield wiper would only work when I held down the wiper arm and that the driver side window dropped into the door.

I want to add here that the superior performance of my Cavalier comes not from any obsessive maintenance on my part. In fact, I treat my car terribly, yet it still continues to run beautifully.<br><br>
