            {Author's note -- this opinion is based on a three-day rental; not on ownership...}

Enterprise handed me the keys to a fresh-off-the-showroom floor Galant last week -- it had 18 miles on the odometer when I picked it up, and 532 when I dropped it off. I got to put it through its paces and -- while I was at it -- screw up the breakin period by driving like a maniac...

The four-door ES model came equipped with a V6 engine and automatic transmission; the options included cruise control and an in-dash CD player (they're rare on Enterprise's rentals -- I enjoyed the little luxury). 

I've never driven any Mitsubishi before, much less a Galant, though I do know a slightly obscene joke about the brand (but I digress -- often). I can, however, compare them to similar vehicles including the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, and Chevy Luimina; all of which I've driven within the past year. The Galant compares favorably; in fact it's a good option that falls somewhere in the middle of that particular pack.


<b>The general experience</b>

I put slightly over 500 miles on the car, most of it on the highway (a 400+ mile round trip to Houston). The road handling required some getting used to, as the steering has more play than most Japanese imports. The tracking is more in line with the somewhat sloppy handling found on Detroit-built luxury cars, most of which have (in my opinion, anyway) overpower steering. The car handles the road well otherwise; it rides smoothly over rough roads and small uneven patches; the speed bumps in my parking lot didn't cause any frame-banging lurches or bounce my head off the ceiling.

The interior is slightly more roomy than an Accord or Taurus, but mostly indistinguishable. The trunk is capacious, mostly because it has one of those phony temp spares. Access to the trunk is poor, however, because of a very narrow opening (front-to-back) and a lid that is potentially skull-threatening.

The V6 is quite peppy; allowing smooth acceleration to freeway speeds and also enough "punch" for passing on two-lane roads. Fuel economy was average to fairly good; I got about 21 mpg while driving at my normal maniacal pace.

Assembly quality of my sample was above average. I saw no bad paint spots or uneven seams, but a subsidiary panel on the dash was poorly aligned. There were no leaks in the relatively heavy rain on my trip back, though there might have been excessive condensation from the A/C unit on my trip to Houston (a sunny afternoon, but near 100% humidity).


<b>the Accelerator</b>

The Galant's design is pleasantly sporty, with well-appointed front seats and a comfortable interior. The V6 is responsive and powerful while retaining above-average fuel efficiency. The instrument panel is well-laid out, with a temperature gauge (not an idiot light) and tach; it has the standard open-door and low fuel warning lights. A center console affords some space for CD storage and there is also a glove box of average size. The small well in the dash for holding keys, etc, is carpeted for a nonslip surface. There is both a cigarette lighter and a subsidiary power port.


<b>the Brakes</b>

The vehicle has some design quirks: although there are two cupholders in the center console, only one is accessible when the storage compartment lid is closed (the other is under the overhang and access is blocked). And, though I looked, I could not find an on-off switch for the passenger-side airbag. The airbag itself is located atop the dashboard, but drivers who habitually have short passengers may want to research this position and the omission of the switch before deciding on a purchase.

The vehicle is not prone to road noise or engine whining, but the interior <i>is</i> louder than the well-padded interiors of the $30000 and up entries in the same size class. There were no squeaks and rattles, but this is as one might expect for a brand new vehicle.



Based on experience with other, competitive vehicles, I'd rate the Galant at or slightly above the middle of the pack. I'm not about to give up my Accord for one, but, given the choice, I'd pick it over the Ford Taurus. If you're in the market for a smallish family car; this vehicle is well worth the look.
