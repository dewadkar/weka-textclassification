            I bought by 1991 Sundance in December 1994.  It is a 4-door automatic with no frills.  It has been a very cheap car to own.  It needed a head gasket job when I bought it, which I grudgingly had done.  Since then, there have been no major repairs.  Granted, I keep up maintenance on my car and that will lower your costs on any car.  However, I have one very large advantage over any other make: my car will tell me what is wrong with it.  
It's true.  Put the key in, turn the ignition on (not quite far enough to start it) then turn it off, on, off, on.  If you have done it right, the <b>CHECK ENGINE</b> light will start to flash.  By counting the flashes, you get codes which will tell you everything a mechanic can find out by hooking your car up to expensive diagnostic tools.  It doesn't take much imagination to figure out why no other cars besides the Iacocca-era Mopars do this.  The trouble codes are found in the Haynes manual, which being a conscientious car owner, you will purchase.

Inside, the car is comfortable and roomy; seats five.  Nothing else of note.

The engine is not terribly powerful, nor is it the most fuel efficient.  But it's not bad either; I would say it is average.  Besides which, it's quiet.  I like that.

If you've been considering a car in this class and price range, go for it.<br><br>
