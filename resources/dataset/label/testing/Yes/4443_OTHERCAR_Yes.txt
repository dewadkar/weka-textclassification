            I just gave up my lease on my 1997 acura cl, and let me tell you, I was sad to see it go.  It was a really nice car, looked good, handled well, and was fun to drive.  The sleek, smooth look of the car made even random standbyers turn their heads. The inside of the car had nice, rich leather which was so comfortable that I could spend the night in them.  The dash had wooden highlights all around, and an automatic climate system.  This was very nice so that all you had to do was input you desired temperature and the car would take car of it.  The radio system was great, only putting out 80 watts, it was a powerfull enough to  turn heads.  This baby did not have much power, but it could ride!  You can get better models which have faster engines and more options.  The Acura Cl is one great little car!<br><br>
