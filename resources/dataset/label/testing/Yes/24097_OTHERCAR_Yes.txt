            With a rather tired 12 year old Jeep Cherokee in the driveway and a cross country trip for a family reunion looming it was definitely time to get a new ride.  The wife and I looked at and drove all the cars we could find in this passenger car category and the LeSbre won hands down.  Why?
     1. Comfort.  This is a wonderfully comfortable car.  The seats have a dual-density foam cushion.  Soft on the top and stiff underneath for support.  Lateral support is decent up-front, though, as a 6-footer I would prefer that the seat was a little longer to offer more support under the knees.  The lumbar support is good- especially for a GM vehicle.  I have noticed that even after sitting in one place I don't suffer the dreaded &quot;Chevy Back Syndrome&quot; which you get from GM pickups from a total lack of lumbar support.  You can tell sufferers of this syndrome because they cannot straighten up and kind of crab-walk rubbing their backs for the first 15 minutes out ofthe vehicle.
     2. Roominess.  It can seat 5 real, live American adults for a long drive in comfort.  I use this car to drive our 5 man football referee's team to games- with trips as long as 180 miles each way.  At 6-0 and 215 pounds I am the smallest member of the team, but we all fit.  Each of us has a duffel bag of equipment which not only fits, but is almost lost in the cavernous trunk.  The trunk would also hold 3 or 4 sets of golf clubs or a couple of bodies bagged up.  I judge back seat room by checking  how much room between my knees and front seat- 4 inches.
     3.  Ride.  The ride is nice, even cushy.  This is not a sports car and under hard driving will exhibit some push, though one must remember that with front wheel drive cars the brakes are not your friends but the throttle will pull you through.  Explaining the characteristics of this car to a friend who was complaining as he fishtailed his Buick &quot;loaner&quot; up onto the highway, &quot; You know, Wes, Very few of the Buick's target audience would take that corner on the Interstate entrance ramp at 95 MPH or hit cruise control at 115 the way you just did.&quot;
     4. Economy.  It is hard to believe, but this car is quite economical.  On a 3 week, 5500 mile trip we averaged 34.7 miles per gallon.  To skeptics- the computer on the dash agreed with my own figures.  I write down the miles and every drop of fuel that goes into any of my vehicles.
     5. Toys.  This is not the Limited, we don't get everything, BUT- The headlights go on by themselves, as do the wipers.  The computer will tell you fuel economy now, since fueling, how long til empty tank, how long 'til the oil should be changed (this varies as to the type of driving you do and how dirty the oil is) and even if you need to add air to the tires.  It is sometimes more fun playing with the computer than watching the road (BAD idea)

Conclusion-  Good, safe, roomy comfortable car.  Buy it if are mature enough to think of comfort, economy, roominess and highway safety and handling.  On the other hand if you want to be stylin', or the main reason to have a car is to pick up chicks, or you drive windy roads at more than 40 miles over the speed limit or you want to be Euro-chic (read asinine) then stay away from this car.  You will hate it.  <br><br>
