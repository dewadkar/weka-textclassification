            This is not just any ordinary SUV, this is a monster when it comes to the winter of Minnesota. The 4Runner makes the weather of MN look like ice cream getting run over. Not only does it have all this power, it also has the 4 wheel drive option to get you through tough times on your daily endeavors. 

This past summer, my cousin became interested in buying a new car since she just landed a fat job graduating from college. With the choices that she had ranging from the Dodge Durango to the Jeep Grand Cherokee; the Toyota 4runner was a winner by a landslide. For the size that is, this SUV handles like a small compact car with the power quadruple. The 4Runner runs smoothly over all terrains. It hums as your rolling down the freeway or the rough country roads. This is one vehicle to take camping or simply just for the enjoyment of offroad driving.

She decided to buy the limited edition model, which everyone knows, comes with all the goodies. Keyless entry, power window, front and back defroster, fog lights, and super comfrotable leather seats and interior.This vehicle also comes with dual air bags. The limited edition model also comes with a cd/radio and cassette player equipt with a state of the art sound system provided from TOYOTA. 

This vehicle is has plenty of room to take the whole family out for the weekend. The passenger side has plenty of leg room and same goes with the back seat. With all that space there still more room in the back for any packing or the naughty kids. 

This vehicle is a great buy for any family. There is plenty of room for the largest or smallest family. Great for the adventurous type as well as the working person in the city. This vehicle is especially great in the bad winters of Minnesota. The 4Runner is a vehicle for all ages
