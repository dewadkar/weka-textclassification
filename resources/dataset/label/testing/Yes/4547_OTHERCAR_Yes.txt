            Improvements upon the C-2020 do include a USB port and a leash for the lens cap so it is no longer easy to lose.

This is my first digital camera and I did quite a bit of research into it before deciding on this model.  I have owned it since Feb '01 when it first appeared on the US market.  I am a big believer in Olympus lens quality, and this camera comes equipped with a new 'super-bright' lens that definitely aids in low-light conditions.  A nice addition for a mid-level camera, and an upgrade from the C-2020 lens.

It is a very solid performer, and a good value for the price(I bought mine before the price dropped).  As for the 2.11 megapixel capability; I find the clarity it affords perfect for my use which is your typical collection of family and vacation photos.  I have taken a multitude of crisp and clear photos, and am very pleased with its performance.  

You don't need an adapter with this camera.  Battery life is very good, so long as you don't expect to leave it on with the LCD display up for hours on end.  Buy a couple sets of rechargeable batteries and a charger and you'll be set.  Buy a 64 MB smart media card and you can enjoy 128 HQ pictures(HQ setting = mid-quality = great for 4x6 photos).    It is true you must use Oly smart cards to access the panoramic function, but when it only costs $69 for a 64 MB Oly card, why complain?

Quick-time videos aren't so hot, but if you want to record videos, why aren't you buying a camcorder?

It is tough to see your image on the LCD display when you are in bright sunlight conditions.  You can rely on the viewfinder if you realize some touch-up may be needed with your photo software later on.  However, both of these are pretty common complaints with digital cameras.
