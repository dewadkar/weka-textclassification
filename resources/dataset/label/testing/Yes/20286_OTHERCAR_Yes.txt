            It's reliable. It's comfortable. It's affordable. So what's wrong with the Nissan Sentra?  Not much. This car is extremely well designed to compete with the Corollas, and Civics of the world.  

Let's start with the good.  It has amazing roominess for a sub $15,000 vehicle.  There is plenty of room in the front cabin as well as very adequate accommodations in the rear.  It's smooth ride is unparalleled in it's class and when loaded with all the extras, you get a lot of style and luxury for the money.

On the flip side, reality sets in and the little 4-banger under the hood doesn't exactly 'get-up-and-go.' The manual 5 speed version does provide the driver with some ability to maximize returns from the limited horsepower.  It might take some time to get up to freeway speeds; however, there is no shaking or rattling as the car smoothly cruises along at 80 mph.  

Who should buy this car:  an environmentalist (40+ mpg), a wise investor (&lt;$15,000 = a great value), a young couple (four doors, roomy enough for the child seat, and $$$ left for diapers)

Who shouldn't: anyone looking to drag race from every green light
