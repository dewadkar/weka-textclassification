            The 1994 Geo Prizm LSI was the first new car my husband and I ever purchased.  I have to say that this car was a very good decision.  We were overseas at the time and traveled many miles in this car. We have had very few problems.  And, nothing major.

We still own this car, and it has 90,000 miles on it.  My husband still uses this car to commute to work about 70 miles round trip each day.  This is a great car for commuting since it gets good gas mileage and is very reliable. This car has proven to be very dependable.

Since we bought the car in 1994 we have had to do the following:

Buy new tires twice-The first time we were run off the road and damaged one of the tires.  And, the Service Shop told us we needed to buy 4 new tires.  The second time we just had to replace the front tires.  And, it is probably ready for another set of tires now.

Replace the windshield-Right after we bought the car a rock flipped up and cracked the windshield causing it to need repair.

One other glitch when it's VERY cold outside the emergency brake light stays on.  Even without the brake on.  We're not sure what is causing this and haven't had it looked at.

This car is the LSI version with power windows and door locks.  And, they are working perfectly (let's hope they stay that way after I write this!)
I have a 1995 Mitsubishi Galant and the power windows in that car don't operate well when it's cold.  But, we've had no problems with the Geo Prizm.

This car is an all around very dependable good car.  With our growing family we will probably upgrade to a minivan in the future.  I have to say I will miss my Geo Prizm.
