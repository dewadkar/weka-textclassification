            I just bought  brand new 2000 Toyota Sienna XLE and it is Swwweet! 
I of course didn't think of a van being a sweet ride but this defineately is.  Moon roof 6 CD changer power sliding doors heated mirrors and back seat windows plus all of the seats weigh less than fourty pounds and are totally easy to work with.
The air bag is designed to take out most of it's force on the windsheild so riding in the front really isn't that big of a danger any more.  In this you can comfortabley seat seven peoplw plus all of their luggage and a cooler!  It has extra outlets for back seat cel-phones or cd players or whatever.
Last night that Toyota Sienna saved my life, I was riding in the middle seat and I was alseep.  The driver fell asleep as well and the car rolled three times! With any other car I would have been crushed to death and hence would not be able to sit here and write this.  
Please remember that the Toyota Sienna save four precios lives last night.
