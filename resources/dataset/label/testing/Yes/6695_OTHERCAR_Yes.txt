            This is by far one of the best looking cars on the road. From the day I purchase it, I have noticed stares everywhere and am approached all the time by people curious about this car. This gets more looks than any Mercedes or Miata ever did. For that reason alone, this car is worth the $25,000 for anyone who likes attention. This is indeed the car that was driven by Bond in the '96 movie Goldeneye in the color called Atlanta Blue (Atlanta because of the Olympics held that year in Atlanta, GA).

Performance on the other hand is a different story. It does not perform as well as it looks. It is a decent car, considering it has a v4 1.9L engine but a lot of Hondas and VWs beat it on the road hands down.  The engine is a bit noisy. Two doors and limited trunk space make it impractical for a family. Since this is a roadster the seats are very low to the ground and not entirely comfortable, but you can get seat cushions which help out a bit. I bought this car used and the previous owner had to replace a few of the knobs, like the headlight switch which just fell off. The Bimmers from South Carolina aren't as solid as those from Germany in general.
But the suspension is wonderful, a truly smooth ride and with the top down on a nice day none of this matters really.
All and all, this is a fun car. It is a toy.

The back window is a little bit of trouble also, it tends to get foggy over time if it is folded down a lot. It isn't very expensive to replace. but again it is a pain you have to deal with. The nice thing about this car is the online network of enthusiasts of the Z3. You can get any question answered on the Z3 bulletin board from people who love the car as much as I do. There are annual Z3 conventions and clinics all over the country. Its a nice group to be a part of.

Overall I am 100% happy I bought this car. It gets great mileage and I look forward to every time I get to take it out for a ride. I find every excuse to go riding, especially on sunny days. It is, after all, a little BMW sports car.    <br><br>
