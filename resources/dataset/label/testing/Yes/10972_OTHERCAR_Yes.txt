            The Chevrolet Suburban is a very safe car, as in accidents the thing won't let you down. The seats in the car are comfortable enough for you to sit in, but don't count on sleeping on the seats; the suburban has the room for you to sleep in but don't make it your first place to stay for the night. The suburban's engine starts up pretty loud and rugged, not to mention that the engine can't take extreme temperatures (below freezing or extremely hot) very well either. If you do want your engine to be in the correct temperature, you'll probably need to expand your garage. The suburban has a problem with fitting in your garage because it's pretty high of the ground, and the size itself, of the suburban, is big enough to pancake some cars in accidents. 
Ready for driving a truck, if you aren't, you'll be surprised how the suburban handles on turns; the suburban is terrible when it comes to lugging the big vehicle, you'll have to go out towards the middle of the street to get the suburban to get the turn without hitting the curb.<br><br>
