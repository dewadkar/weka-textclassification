            The VE30DE engine came standard in 92-94 SE Maximas. This DOHC engine produes 190HP and 190ft/lb of torque to give this maxima a 0-60mph time of only 6.7 seconds. This is very impressive for such a luxurious four door sedan like the Maxima. This engine was one of the first to used variable timing in the cam shaft. This was called VTC in the maximas and later copied in other makes of cars including Honda(VTEC). The 93 Maxima SE is a great vehicle; very fast while very comfortable. Everyone should own one of these to truely experience VE Power. It is nicely equipped with a 200 watt BOSE sound system standard in the SE model. <br><br>
