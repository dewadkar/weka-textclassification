            I bought this mercury sable wagon last year,1999.
I love it!!!
The most efficient car in the world.

The most important aspect of the car's features is that this vehicle is that I needed extra space for my stuff such as books, computer, other tools. I need those thing wherever I visit. 

I love, also, the aerodynamic shape of the body. My friends are always asking me a ride because I am a good personality and driving this car.
The interior is relatively adequate yet some plastic parts may become loose. 

The feeling of driving this car is extraordinary; the acceleration of this car is 6.4 sec from 0 to 60 km/hr. The braking system is excellent with ABS system. However, sometimes, while braking at the high speed, some squeaky noise may occurs. 

I think this car is probably good for almost anyone except for those who don't want any wagons in their life.<br><br>
