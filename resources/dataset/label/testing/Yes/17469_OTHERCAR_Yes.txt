            I bought my Sedona almost one year ago.  It was the first week they were available in AZ.  When I told my friends I bought a Kia van they had some funny looks.  Several friends have have since bought Kia vans and are also happy.

What this van is, is the best van on a budget.  I am sure you have all seen cheaper adds in the paper but find the van has NO room in the back (caravan, not Grand Caravan), no dual AC and a small 4 cylinder engine. Tint was also usually extra.  I have 3 children and dual air and decent acceleration was important.

What was NOT important to me was a TV screen, power EVERYTHING, leather, CD player, major electronics.
You can get this stuff if you want.

In over a year I have no major problems related to the van.  I did have an alignment done with just over 10,000 miles on the car but the warranty covered it.  The gas mileage is strangely poor but I guess that is as a result of the weight which translates into safety.  I purchased mine before they received 5 stars in some crash tests so that was comforting. 

Hey, it aint a Honda.  The stock cloth seats are just OK.  The middle one could give you a hernia moving it.  The driver auto door lock is the only one that locks all the doors. This can be a major pain with my small kids.  I have to round them up then go back to the drivers door to lock all doors.  I should have purchased a keyless remote.  The space behind the rear seat is not huge, just adequate.  But you want a Honda, pay for it.

One problem related to the dealer, not the van. I bought the bone stock model. Kia of Scottsdale, AZ installed my roofrack.  It later FLEW OFF the van with my luggage attached into the freeway.  The dealership now will not reimburse my luggage.  They feel replacing the roofrack was enough.  Still love the van.  A year later I would still buy it again if I had to buy another today.
