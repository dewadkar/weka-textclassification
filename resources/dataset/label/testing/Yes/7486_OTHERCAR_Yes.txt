            <b>Renting the Old Standby</b>

As a frequent business traveler, I have the occasion to rent cars several times a month. My Emerald Aisle membership with National often allows me to choose from a variety of makes and models, all at the same contract rate. In Orlando recently, I had my choice of full-size cars, luxury cars, SUV's, and pickup trucks in addition to the standard offering of mid-size and compact vehicles. I chose a new Camry, a perhaps uninteresting but nonetheless solid option. 

<b>Something Different for a Change</b>

On the next trip, I felt a little more adventurous and looked for something I'd never driven before. The selection on the Emerald Aisle in Orlando always seems to be good. I found a new gold 2000 Dodge Stratus ES with fewer than 1,000 miles on it. With its cab-forward design it more or less beckoned me to try it out, and I succumbed. I drove the car off the lot, and then used it for the next week.

This vehicle is well-loaded, with a suggested retail price of $19,980. Leather interior is included as a no-cost option. The ES model I chose boasted a 168 HP V-6 engine and Chrysler's autostick--a four-speed &quot;manumatic&quot; transmission that allows the driver to let the vehicle shift gears by itself or to do so manually. 

I found the autostick to be a lot of fun. Shifting gears without a clutch pedal was an unusual experience. Both the automatic and the manual selection shifted gears smoothly. In addition to the leather seats, the ES features an 8-way power driver's seat, power windows and locks, and some nice touches like a faint light showing the cupholders at night. The AM/FM stereo cassette produces a good quality sound, but certainly nothing special.

<b>Acceleration and Handling</b>

The V-6 is much noisier than I expected, both at low and higher speeds. I haven't had occasion to drive the Stratus any faster than 65 MPH, but at that speed, there is a noticeable whine. Moreover, the engine is not as peppy as one might expect, though it certainly gets the job done.

The cab-forward design presents an excellent view of the road. The handling of the Stratus ES is excellent. The car has a tight road feel, corners well, and brakes quickly. I had to remember to downshift in the manual mode after nearly stalling the car in fourth gear.

<b>I Like Driving It, But Probably Wouldn't Buy One</b>

With the leather interior and the other nice amenities, I was surprised that this unit did not have a CD player (which adds $187 to the price, according to MSN CarPoint). Fog lights and cruise control are both standard on the ES. 

Although fun, the manual mode quickly gets old in stop-and-go city traffic, but remains enjoyable on the Interstate. This car is well designed and very affordable, but probably not something Iï¿½d want to purchase after driving it for a week. The engine noise is loud and the acceleration a little sluggish. As with the Camry, I was not disappointed, but neither was I inspired. If I were in the market for a new vehicle in the $20,000-range, the Stratus ES, though fun to drive, would not be my first choice.
