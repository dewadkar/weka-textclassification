            I got a 1999 Durango SLT Plus (what is an SLT today) for my 21st birthday.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking, what a spoiled brat.  Well, let me tell you, I am.  I absolutely love this car, and I've been driving sport utes exclusively since I've had my license.  So that you don't have to scroll through the entire review, let me state my opinions right up front:

Bang for the buck:  I bought this car outright for what amounts to about $24,500.  That included leather, the premium sound, trailer package, third seat, power everything, a dealer installed alarm, heavy duty electrical and cooling, high-zoot 4x4 system, and premium wheels.  Compared to a 4Runner (which came with none of the above for the same money), the RX400(which is more minivan than truck) and a Expedition (like driving a condo) the Durango scores extremely high in this regard.

Size:  In a word, optimal.  Not to big that parking is a three hour search operation, not too small that you'll have to take two cars.  It's as perfect a size car as you're ever going to find.  The seats all fold flat with no effort, and the car is surprisingly nimble.  When hauling gear, there always seems to be just the right amount os pace, it's uncanny.

Solidity:  You will always feel like this car is well made.  It's solid over the bumps, and it's trucklike feel translates to a feeling of industrial strength.  The no-nonsense dials and switches, while not expensive feeling, feel nonetheless sturdy, as does the rest of the car.  More than anything, take a drive down your most poorly maintained road (the I-10 in LA is a fine example).  Cars 20-80,000 dollars more expensive aim for this level of stiffness.  It's rocklike, for lack of a better word.

On the other hand...

Fuel economy:  10, flat in the city.  I have the 5.9L engine, and while it's neat for a while to have an engine 3 times larger than most other cars, the novelty wears off every week when you're pouring in 25 gallons at the pump.  My gripe becomes less loud when you have to pull something, 'cause the torque is fantastic, but for all those non-pulling days (like, 355 days a year for most of us), the jackrabbit fuel gauge gets pretty tiresome.  You begin really noticing when gas prices drop, and you'll find yourself driving WAY out of your way to get cheap gas.

Cupholders:  For a DaimlerChrysler vehicle, the people who brought you the greatest cupholder in the world (in the Caravan), these holes in the center console just don't cut the mustard.  I use them more for pennies than for real cup holding because they just don't fit anything.

Tires:  I don't know how much of this has to do with the tires, but I've blown three in a month, and I wasn't exactly driving in a nail factory.  Actually, on the freeway, and in parking lots.  I still haven't figured out what happened, and neither do the guys in the tire store...

Those are seriously the only gripes I have about this car.  To summarize, let me relate it to a couple of other models out there that I have owned (and let me tell you, I'd buy the Durango over all of them).  It feels as solid as an Isuzu, really rattle free, but with way more power and it drives much better.  While it isn't as roomy as a Tahoe or Expedition, and lacks their gee-wizardry, the overall practicality of its capabilities is more than capable.  Yeah, so it doesn't have auto climate control or adjustable pedals.  If you can't live without those...you need help, serious help.  It's reliability record far outstrips any model Grand Cherokee, and it's so much better a value than either the G.Cherokee or a Landcruiser.  It looks fantastic, and is really a crowdpleaser, whether you're pulling good-looking girls out of the ditch on the way up to the ski slopes, piling 6 friends to go to the bowling alley, or hauling rations for 150 at the party at your house (all of which have been done in the last week).  If you have to get an SUV, and can afford this car's nasty drinking habit, go with the Durango.
