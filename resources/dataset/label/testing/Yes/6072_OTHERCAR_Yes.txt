            Quality

Do you want to test how well a car is built? Go to your Lexus, Infinity, Cadillac Dealers and open and close a door. Then go to the MB dealer and do the same on their entry level car. You'll know what I mean. It is impossible to describe in words, but there is a sound that a Mercedes makes when the door closes that lets you know immediately how well it is built. The interior does not have as much "pizazz" as say  a Lexus with it's back-lit fluorescent display, but everything is put together extremely well, and tastefully done.

Performance

It is unbelievable how well this car handles at speed considering that it is in fact a luxury 4 door sedan. Although I wouldn't suggest that you drive this way, I have had the urge to see what the car can do on long stretches of highway. I had to ease up in excess of triple digits, for fear of getting a rather severe ticket. Anything over 100 is considered reckless driving in California. This car is so stable, and Quiet! at high speeds, that you almost don't believe the speedometer. I could have driven faster, but the thought of my car and me being impounded quickly brought me back to my senses. Although I don't advocate driving a car this fast, it goes a long way to show you the type of engineering built into this car. The model I have is the E320 with the Sport Kit. This adds subtle ground effects, a revised front end with Circular Fog Lamps and a Mesh Grille, and very low profile Goodyear Tires on 17 inch rims. This car looks like an AMG modified Mercedes for $20,000 less than an E55. Although ride is sacrificed due to the stiffer suspension, it more than compensates for this with improved handling. In terms of acceleration, this car has nothing to apologize for. It still surprises me that there is only a 3.2 Liter V-6 under the hood. There is a 4.3 Liter V-8 available if you need to get to 60 Miles Per hour in 6 seconds.  

Safety

As has been the custom of Mercedes Benz, this is a safe vehicle. There are 10 Air Bags in this car. There are the obvious 2 in the steering wheel and in the glove box, but there is 1 in each door, as well as Curtains in the Roof that protect you and your loved ones if there is a side impact. Studies have shown that severe brain injuries occur when a car is hit on the side at speeds of 35 Miles Per Hour. It is great peace of mind to know that all of these technological devices are there if you ever need them. Something that surprised me is the lack of effort required to put on the seat belts. I know that these belts have probably been overengineered, given Mercedes' obsession with safety, but these belts are so lightweight, with so little resistance, that they are by far the most comfortable seat belts that I have ever put on. Another Mercedes trademark is the fact that in the event of an accident, the doors are designed to open! Also, if there is a rollover or a severe accident, the SOS system will call and notate, via GPS, the location of the accident.

Features

I will not elaborate on all the features of this car, fearful of getting Carpal Tunnel. Let me say that the Owners Manual for this car is Hard Bound and has nearly 300 pages.  You can control the following from the steering wheel: Stereo Volume, Radio Search, Tape Search, CD Search, Make a phone call, Check your trip distance and mileage per gallon.

There are 3 memory positions for the driver that memorize seat, mirror and steering wheel position (Tilt and telescope) There are 3 memory positions for the passenger seat as well. Both front seats are heated. I thought this was a useless option when it came with my car, but it is worth it, even in California. The 4 windows and the sunroof will fully open up at the touch of a button, and the 4 windows will fully close at the touch of a button. Curiously, the sunroof does not have one touch closing.

The climate control is top notch. You can set the temperature separately for yourself and the passenger, and then forget about it. There is also a nice feature if you get stuck behind a Greyhound bus. Activate a Charcoal Filter and you will no longer have to breathe those obnoxious diesel fumes.  

Complaints:
Although there is a lot of room in the back, this is at the expense of trunk space. This car DOES not have a cavernous trunk. It pretty much ends at the rear window. The trunk is shaped well, and there is good access due to the trunk extending to the bumper, but there is not as much trunk room as I would expect in a car of this size.
The dealer will show you that you can open and close the remotes and sunroof from the remote, but this is a useless feature. You practically have to be next to the car, and they will only open and close as long as you are pressing the button. Mercedes needs to make this a one touch option, with greater range for this feature to be useful.

I still love every aspect of this car. However, I need to mention a couple of annoyance that have surfaced. 

1. The windshield wipers are terrible. The E Series uses a single wiper blade with a complex motor system. When the car was new, it worked great. It would cover nearly 90 percent of the windshield. However, as time went on, the blade became distorted from being parked at a constant angle. The wiper blades were not worn out, as it would Squeegee part of the window as it was new, but would miss about 80 square inches in the center of the windshield. I went back to the dealership and had the blade replaced, but there is still about 20 square inches in the center of the windshield that is not contacted by the blade. I will go back to the dealer, but it seems like a waste of time to have to make two trips to the dealer to resolve this problem. 

2. The owner's manual says that the sunroof is auto open and close, but it only opens automatically. To close the sunroof, you need to hold the button for about ten seconds.

These are minor annoyances, but I thought they deserved mention in my review. Other than these annoyances, the car is still the best car I have ever driven.
