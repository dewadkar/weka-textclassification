            I bought my Silver Saturn SL in a big rush, because my youngest son, Brian had totaled my 1987 vehicle.  This car was paid for, and cost me little.  Brian had been told if he EVER wrecked my car, or got a ticket, I would turn his drivers license.

I got the phone call from the police on a Saturday night, after 10 pm., two weeks after I had had major surgery (female).  I was feeling lousy, and did NOT need a call from police.

After the initial shock that I needed to discipline my son, and buy a car in a HURRY, I went to check out the Saturn.  I walked into the dealership, knowing I was feeling lousy and did NOT need a bunch of bickering.  

My salesman was very professional, suggested I test drive, and also drove the car so I could ride and drive the same morning.  I fell in love at first sight.

I said, just sell me something that is NOT white, and is Stick Shift.  He left me in his office with coffee, donuts, and a couple of aspirin.  He brought in a complete list of colors, and I said Silver, and the paperwork began.  It was quick, painless, and within an hour, I was driving my new Saturn home.

I took it to Denver, from Las Vegas, and SURPRISE, I got 44 miles to the gallon with the AIR Conditioner ON!!  I get great mileage in town, have NEVER had a problem with service, or maintenance, and now it has 15,000 miles, and I still LOVE my Silver Saturn.  Ps.  Brian got his license back after 6 months, bought his OWN car, and graduated High School with honors.<br><br>
