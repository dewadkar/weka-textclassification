            I recently went with a friend of mine who was looking for a new car.  We did the rounds of several dealers, drove their cars, then sat down to hear about all the extras that were not included in the bottom price.  We ended up at the Saturn dealership where she instantly fell in love with the new SC1 3-door coupe.  We took it out for a drive and proceeded into the office where we were both in for a shock.  The salesman was friendly, open and honest about the whole deal.

Well, my friend bought her car and out of curiosity, I asked about trading my 1994 Camaro in.  Needless to say, I walked out as the very proud owner of a 2001 SC2 3-door coupe. 

This is one great car.  It handles as well as my sporty Camaro did.  The mileage is great.  It's comfortable to ride in and the third door opens at almost a 90 degree angle which enables you to put a large item in the back seat.  (And I have already done this.)  The trunk is very large and the rear seats fold down for even more room.  

The other outstanding thing about this car is the attitude of the salesmen.  I have never enjoyed going to a car dealership but I certainly enjoyed my experience here.
