            My husband and I  recently purchased for the first time a Conversion Van fully equipped with Television and VCR.  What a hit!  With our four children growing by leaps and bounds the room in our van is greatly appreciated.  We looked at Suburban's and compared price and room. The conversion van made the Suburbans look like Volkswagons. 

As for driving, it handles wonderfully as I drive it locally everyday.  The gas mileage has been at 13-14 mpg.  Not great, but truly not bad for the size of this vehicle.  We are looking forward to heading south for Spring break.  

The downside to this vehicle is its size.  It is too tall to fit into our garage.  It is too tall to go through most automatic car washes.  But it is great for me to stand up in the back of the van.  I would recommend this car to any big family.  The price was incredible for what you get.
