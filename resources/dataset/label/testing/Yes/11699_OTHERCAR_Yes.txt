            Although this is my first Subaru, many of my family and friends have owned Subarus in the past so I got a little taste of what they are all about. The number one trait that Subarus posess is reliability (and I guess the close #2 would be longevity) I have seen these cars go for over 200,000 miles consistently. That was a major factor when decision time came for me to buy a new car. 

I have always been a Honda guy and I still do believe that they make some of the best cars on the planet...however... I needed all wheel drive which the accord, unfortunately, does not have. So after assisting my friend in the purchase of a 98 legacy gt a year ago, and helping her drive it home in a snowstorm... I was hooked... this car handles like no other car I had ever driven... This planted the seed to consider the new Legacy for my next car. 

I just purchased the new 2004 Legacy L 35th anniversary edition recently. I only paid 19,500 for it brand new!! I was shocked that there was still a car out there for under 20,000 dollars... it is rediculous what car companies are charging these days... for junk!! This car is LOADED... Power everything, 16 in alloy wheels, sunroof, power seat, airbags, rubber mats, and the most important part... ALL WHEEL DRIVE! 

I bought it with a 5 speed and although it isn't quite as fast as my old civic with a motor swap, it is peppy! Plenty fast enough to take you anywhere you want to go. 165 horsepower is no slouch! But where this car shines is in the handling... right now we live in FL and we get some of the worst rain ever... and there are always tons of accidents due to people hydroplaning off the road or into other cars. One day when it was pouring, I drove to a back road where there were no other cars and I tested it out. I ripped around curves and really tried to get the car to slide out and lose control... No way.. this car stuck like glue to the wet pavement. And on the dry roads it is even better. 

We are moving back to the northeast next year hence the real need for all wheel drive. And as I mentioned above, I had driven my friends Legacy in the snow before, and the performance was staggering. I have owned many 4wd trucks before (Jeeps, Blazers, Toyotas) and the legacy blew them all way with it's sure-footedness (is that a word??) But again, when I would try to make the car shy off it's path, it would automatically correct itself and bring me back in control. 

The seats are extremely comfortable (front and back) and there is even a little pass-through between the seats for skis, snowboards, etc. The trunk is huge as well although, the hinges come down into the trunk itself when closing which cuts back on room a little. The air works beautifully and cools the whole car down quickly (haven't used heat yet in FL...) 

The car is also very good looking. It has a nice blend of sport, luxury, and functionality. The 16 inch rims that come with the 35th anniversary edition (and the GT) definitely help complete the look. I just bought an aftermarket spoiler for $350 to help make it just a little sportier, and I also purchased the sunroof wind deflector that I think adds another nice dimension to the car. 

I originally was going to purchase the GT model but it was almost $5000 more!! It had very few differences: side airbags, different side molding that makes it look a little lower to the ground, a lighted ignition ring, a better rear differential (but I mean, how much better can it be?!), an auto dimming rear view mirror with a compass, and maybe a couple other minor things... I just did not see the need to spend $5000 on these things... I felt great getting all that I did for under $20000!! 

I get about 23 mpg right now with almost all city driving. I expect to get upper 20's on the highway. That's another thing, on the highway, this car cruises beautifully. You just feel safe, not like a big 18 wheeler is going to blow you off the road. Very stable and confident. 

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for the best bang for the buck. There simply isn't anything out there that comes close! Especially if you want all wheel drive Audi? BMW? ...try again... you are into the upper 30's before you even get floor mats with them... and with Audi and BMW, your 1st trip in for service (and there will be many of them...especially with Audi/VW products...) will cost you an arm and a leg. 

Subaru knows how to do it. Make a dynamite product that will last you forever, and make it affordable for the masses. The 35th anniversary edition was definitely the best value with all the extra bells and whistles you get that normally did not come on the standard L. I'll buy another Subaru after this for sure! But I bet this one will last me at least 10 years!
