            This new car offers so much to the person who wants it all, a fast sports car with good handling, a family sized seating and cargo area as well as luxury care. The heated front seats are amazing and the fact that they added the rear seat heaters is over the top! The sound system and 6 cd in-dash changer are amazing! The controls on the steering wheel are easily accessible and aid in the ease of driving and comfort. The rear seat sun shades are a great feature for kids or even for keeping the car a little cooler on a hot summer afternoon. The rear seats fold down giving you ample room for cargo, although I doubt you will need it with all the room in the back. The wagon is big enough to carry my golf bag (with clubs), my emergency crate, my laptop case, my briefcase and more! The trunk also has a cover to conceal anything you choose to hide in the trunk, it easy to put on and there is no way to see anything underneath it. The trunk also has built-in hooks for the cargo net which is a great idea for shopping bags and anything else that might fall over or roll on its own. The built in car phone feature is also nice, i can hook my phone up, talk and control it through the controls in the steering wheel. The car also has a good indoor height. My dad is 6'4" and he has a tall torso instead of the tall legs, making it very hard for him to fit into any car without hitting the top of his head, but this car provides plenty of head room. in fact he was happy to find out he could not only fit in it but he could also wear a hat just fine! The car is smooth to drive as expected from any Audi car. The triptronic system meets all my drive needs and desires for speed and agility! I would definately recommend this car to anyone, even those who think station wagons are only family cars!
