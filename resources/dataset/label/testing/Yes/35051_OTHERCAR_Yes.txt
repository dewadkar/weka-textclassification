            I myself am a Landrover fanatic and when the release of the Discovery Series II came, I knew that I would need to get my hands on one!  When my wife told me that she wanted a new car, I suggested the Discovery.

When I arrived in the showroom, I was amazed at the new Disco.  The length and width looked a lot larger than my 97 Discovery.  Landrover claims that the Discovery Series II is 85% rebuilt and after looking at the Disco, I have no objections to that statement.

Engine:
The engine is probably the weakest part of the the new Discovery.  Although much improved from the older model, the new model is heavier which requires more power. They increased the engine power just enough so that the new weight and power evened out. With the Disco, you will feel quite lonely when the light turns green.  But this does not bother many rover owners. I recently got a custom 4.6 leter V8 engine put it and the car runs a lot more smoothly! If you have the extra cash at any point, I suggest you look into this.

Exterior:
This has not changed very much at all compared to the older model.  The length and width and wider and longer, and the full size spare tire has a new holder design.  That's pretty much it!

Interior:
Front Row:
-Driver and passenger airbags, no side airbags
-Average leg room for any SUV
-Tape deck area looks like it was built with stone age tools, also known  as British design
-Plenty of head room
-Pew raised windshield is helpful
-Seats are very comfortable

Middle Row:
-Same leg room as before
-Even more head room then the front row
-Seats are a bit stiff and still comfortable
-Pockets on the incline of the roof able to store CD's, etc.
-I have a TV set that comes down from the ceiling and works great

Optional Back Row:
-Two seat option
-New seats face forward and can be tucked in to the sides when not needed
-Head rests come down from ceiling for increased comfort
-Back seats recommended for children only

Traction: 
In the old Discovery, you could feel quite a lot of roll on some turns. With the new optional ACE or Active Cornering Enhancment, roll is extinct from the Disco. The increased weight and full time four wheel drive also help the Discos traction.

Conclusion:
This is a perfect car for any family, man, or woman as long as they are willing to accept that the Discovery Series II is a SUV and not a Van or Sedan.<br><br>
