                Moving up from a two-door Blazer, this was a nice progression. I had driven a friend's previously,and I knew this is what we were looking for. Safety is a big factor,living in the country and needing a vehicle that was sufficiently reliable during inclimate weather, Explorer does provide an ease of mind. Still,one should not substitute this fact with false complacency, as it can slide off the road if you go in excess of what existing conditions permit.Truck is rough on front brakes, you will notice a darkening of tires from the brake dust. Plenty of room for work or play,and we use it in both capacities. New Explorers have everything you could ask for, but make sure your wallet is full. With rising fuel prices, one needs to choose between luxury and efficiency. All features from top to bottom are satisfactory, can't honestly say that anything blatantly contributes as a negative. Other owners I know are happy and repeat as customers, as I will too.<br><br>
