            When word first leaked out that Toyota was developing a car to challenge the best from Mercedes, the automotive world scoffed. No Japanese company could ever match the engineering and heritage of the fine Europeans. Then the LS 400 appeared in the fall of 1989, and these derisive voices quickly fell silent. Though even then it looked a bit much like a Mercedes, the new car was such a competent performer, was so smooth, was so quiet, was so comfortable, and all for a base price of $35,000, that it revolutionized the entire luxury car industry. In two ways. First, Mercedes and BMW soon recognized that they could no longer engineer their cars to death without regard to costs, that they had to align their prices to what consumers wanted to pay. Second, the Germans realized they would have to attend to interior comfort and ambiance as much as powertrain and chassis performance.

Nothing hit these points home more than the reception received by Mercedes' new S-Class flagship when it was launched two years after the first Lexus LS. The new car was soundly criticized for its many excesses. It was just too big, too heavy, and too loaded with gadgetry of questionable utility. It even had motors to pull the doors closed. Massive, slab-sided styling made an already huge car look even larger. No one thought it beautiful. Did I forget too expensive? Even the base car, which relied on a six cylinder to move its 4500 lbs, cost over $70,000, nearly twice the price at the time for the V8 Lexus LS 400. The V12 could cost twice that again. All in all, it was just too much. Sales suffered as Mercedes feverishly sought to reinvent not only its cars but itself. How well has this effort paid off? To find out, I drove a 2001 S430 right after driving the new Lexus LS 430.

<b>Styling</b>

For reasons that are beyond the understanding of this mere mortal, Lexus styled their new flagship to look very much like the old S-Class. If only they had known what the new S-Class would look like at the time they were designing it. Then they could have copied it instead.

This S-Class is smaller than the old one, but a couple inches in wheelbase, length, and height, and an inch in width. It�s also over a quarter ton lighter, so that it now weighs about the same as the competition. The old car was very slab-sided, reflecting and accentuating it�s extreme mass. It wasn�t beautiful, but no car more strongly suggested that the driver must be someone of power and importance. The new one�s lines just flow. The beltline is a subtle arc, much like that which marked the genius of ancient Greek architecture. What the ancient Greeks knew was that the human eye prefers an arc to a straight line. It certainly works here. Both ends are tapered, with the body�s widest point at the rear wheels. The front axle is well forward, something hard to do without a rear-wheel-drive chassis. The sweeping cutline for the rear door works very well with the theme, and its nicely reflected in the cutline for the taillight. The headlights and taillights are very large, for excellent performance, but are styled to blend very well with the body. They do not appear out of proportion. Nothing appears out of proportion. It may cut a less imposing figure than the old one, but the curent �big Mercedes� is now without a doubt a beautiful car. To my eyes it may be the best looking sedan on the market, period. 

The styling of the interior is not nearly as successful. Mercedes could learn something from Lexus here. I�m not sure what it is, but something about top half of the dash makes me think Buick. It�s wide and low, with a sweeping curve highlighted by a strip of wood from one door to the other. But that�s not the bad part. The instrument gauges are styled but in an unattractive manner. The speedometer is too large (that Buick influence?), while the tach is too small. The tach is also poorly oriented, such that 0 RPM is around noon and the needles moves down as RPM rise.  Entirely different functions are controlled by identical buttons strewn across the dash. One to be used when having the car towed is up there with those you�ll use all the time. And that�s before you get to the expansive center stack, which houses an off-center screen flanked by a complicated array of associated controls. This area of the dash looks bad. I suspect it was styled by engineers. I works even worse. It took me five minutes to figure out how to turn the radio off (a �pwr� button to the bottom right of the joystick). Finally, the quality of the interior materials is clearly a cut below those in the new Lexus. Some pieces, like the doors to the storage compartments attached to the front of the front seats, feel downright cheap. More often, the materials look and feel much like those in the durable, utilitarian interiors or Mercedes past. The door pulls remind me of those in my mother�s �72 SL, which in classic Mercedes fashion has a black vinyl interior. They should check out the door pulls in the Lexus LS. When you use them, you�ll find the softest leather resides behind them. You do not see it, but this leather feels wonderful, and imparts a feeling of the highest luxury.

<b>Accommodations</b>

Despite some shrinkage, this remains a very roomy interior. On paper the new Lexus LS matches the S-Class for total legroom. In the real world, there is far more rear legroom in the Mercedes. Though the rear seat is a touch low to provide good thigh support for my 5�9� self, there is plenty of room to cross my legs. Or your legs, for that matter, no matter how long they may be. We�re talking lots and lots of room back there.

All four outboard positions are quite comfortable. The seat cushions are firm (in the traditional Mercedes fashion) but are nicely shaped and supportive. The stiff standard leather could be more luxurious. The Napa leather (standard in other S-Class models, but an $800 option in this one) should help here. One of the �Designo� packages certainly would, but at roughly ten grand for just trim they seem a bit pricey. 

The front seats are much better suited to aggressive driving than those in the Lexus LS. The side bolsters actually make some contact with your body. I suspect that the optional seats in the $1.960 Comfort Package, with �dynamic multicontour seat backs,� are even better in this regard. If you�re in the market for this car, I�d learn more about this option. The controls for the seats are on the door, where they are very easy to see and use. I�m sure Lexus would put them here too, if they could. But Mercedes owns the patent, and has been very aggressive in defending it against the competition. (The first Infiniti Q45 had these controls, but they soon went bye-bye when Mercedes objected.)

The center rear position suffers from a high, firm cushion, a driveline hump, and an overly reclined seatback. But then that�s very rarely a good place to sit in any car. Most of the options for the car focus on making the rear seat a special place. If you want to spend the money, you can add power adjustments ($1,785), ten fans for ventilation and heat ($1,530), and four zone climate control ($1,840). But the main advantages of this car come from riding in the driver�s seat, so I suspect I�d personally pass on these.

Storage is good, if not nearly as good as the outstanding storage in the big Lexus. The glove compartment and center console have a useful amount of space, about the average for this class. Ditto the trunk, which at 15 cubic feet is a bit smaller than I�d expect in such a large car. Though this is also about average for this class, that in the base Lexus is one-third larger.

<b>On the road</b>

Much if not all of the faults listed above are forgotten once underway. The low dash pays huge dividends: the view from the driver�s seat is amazingly clear. Far better than the closed-in feeling when driving the big Lexus or the sunken feeling created by the tall instrument binnacle in the big BMW. Combined with the excellent feel and responsiveness of the steering, this driving position makes it much easier to drive the Mercedes aggressively. My father, who was along for this test drive, could not get over how much more confident he felt when driving this car. If you didn�t look behind you, you�d never guess that this car has the longest wheelbase on the market. From the driver�s seat it feels far smaller. Hard as it may seem, to me it felt more nimble and maneuverable than the smallest Mercedes sedan, the C-Class. Maybe it was just because I�d just driven the Lexus, but still an amazing achievement. For those who want to fully optimize the handling of the car a Sport Package is available for the low, low price of $4,900. Aside from a body kit, this package replaces the stock 225/60HR16s with 245/45YR18s in the front and 275/40YR18s in the rear on AMG �monoblock� wheels. Though these undoubtedly improve the chassis� responsiveness and grip, and those huge wheels should make this car look even more marvelous, I�d want to sample the ride quality of this set-up before buying. Even with the standard tires, I liked the handling better than any other large car I�ve driven, even the supposedly superior BMW 7-Series (where the driving position crimps my satisfaction).

At first my father and I were shocked by how poor the ride quality of the car with the regular tires was, especially since air springs are standard (they are optional in the Lexus). Even tar strips were slightly jarring. My father drove first, so I was able to do some thinking. The salesman had not come along, so he couldn�t tell us what was going on. He also hadn�t given us any instructions about the controls before sending us on our way. But I had a hunch. This ride was just too bad to be the standard setting. So I started scanning all those buttons, and found a rocker switch with a shock absorber icon and two little lights, both lit. I tapped the rocker down twice, and those lights went out. The ride became A LOT smoother. Even a touch floaty. The Lexus has two suspension settings, but I couldn�t tell the difference between them. No such problem here. I couldn�t tell a lot of difference between semi-firm and firm, but both of these were tremendously different than the base setting. If memory serves, this rocker is the one closest to the driver, a good place for it. If I owned this car I'd use it often. The base setting affords an excellent ride, if still not quite as creamy as that in the Lexus. The firm settings substantially improve the handling, though even on the base setting the handling is very good for everyday driving. All this said, I wish there was a setting between the base setting and semi-firm that eliminated the slight floatiness without introducing harshness. It's very quiet inside, but without the sense of being in a soundproof chamber you have in the big Lexus.

The engine produces plenty of power to move the car, but never provides a huge kick in the lower back. I suppose that�s what the 5.0 V8 and 5.8 V12 are for. And it should be a forte the AMG-tuned 5.5 in the S55. So if you need more grunt, just spend more money. The engine note is standard Mercedes, which is to say pleasingly mechanical but not especially luxurious. The transmission shifts smoothly. A manumatic function is provided by knocking the lever laterally in �D.� Tap left for down, right for up. This doesn�t so much select the gear as select the highest possible gear, much like in the Lexus GS implementation. So if you select �3� the transmission will use the first three gears. To return to regular operation tap to the right till you�re back to �5.� Not as easy as having a dedicated lever position for manumatic operation, but it works just fine as long as you understand how it operates. Just be warned that downshifts are far from immediate, more than once occurring halfway through the turn even when called for in advance.

One option not on the car I drove was �Distronic� cruise control ($2,800). (I just love the prices of these options. The base price of the car seems reasonable for what you get, but that of the options often strains credulity.) Though it uses radar instead of lasers, I suspect it works much the same as the system I tried out in the Lexus to keep a constant distance between you and the car in front of you. Though the price is a bit steep, this would be quite useful in everyday highway driving, and wonderful for long trips. Another option is �Parktronic.� I suspect this rear obstacle detection system works much like that in the many other vehicles in which it is now an option. But this is a Mercedes system, so it�s nearly four times the price of the similar option in a Ford Explorer at $995. Kinda makes me wonder what that �Distronic� system would cost in a normal car. I suspect it�ll be a $500 or so option in many places within a decade.

<b>Final words</b>

If you�re in the market for this class of car, which should you buy? If you know your own priorities, the choice should be clear. The 2001 S-Class is a much different car than the Lexus LS, which now approaches it in price when comparably equipped. It is decidedly less luxurious, and the interior is not nearly as well thought-out. On the positive side, all of the sensations are much more direct. As a result, this car is much more enjoyable to drive than the LS, especially if you like to drive aggressively. The driving position is surprisingly good, and this further aids driver confidence. Finally, the S-Class is now drop-dead gorgeous. It�s so beautiful that I almost hope that for the next LS Lexus copies it yet again. <br><br>
