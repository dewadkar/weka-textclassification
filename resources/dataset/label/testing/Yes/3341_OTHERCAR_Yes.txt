                 Very few cars can match the performance, styling and price of the Stealth RT Twin Turbo.  The car is a reliable, head turning sports machine with plenty of ground pounding power.
     The performance factor of this car is why I purchased it.  The DOHC 24V, twin turbo intercooled engine is the heart of this vehicle.  The engine pumps out an impressive 300 horsepower and 307 ft-lbs. of torque.  The AWD platform provides excellent traction and control.  300 hp and AWD can propel this rocket to 60mph in 6 seconds.  The quarter mile comes by in the low 14's.  Very few cars can compete.  Bye-bye 2000 SVT Cobra, as well as many other sports cars.
     The options on the Stealth RT are well welcomed.  The options include leather, power seat, electronic suspension and exhaust, graphic display of A/C, sunroof, and an impressive sound system.  These options make for a pleasant ride.  
     The Stealth RT is also a very reliable car, if maintained.  I own both versions of this Japanese Ferrari(Stealth RT and Mitsubishi VR-4).  Both have exhibited no problems.  I perform the upkeep myself.  There is a downside to this car though.  The parts are expensive and and service is even more expensive.  If you can do the service yourself, your in good shape.  But either way, don't let that timing belt go!  Let it snap and you've just bought a new engine! Ouch.  But the car's engine is a work of art, and if properly maintained, it should give you countless mile of enjoyment.
     There are three models of the Stealth.  The base model, ES, and RT Twin Turbo.  The base model has a 160hp SOHC engine and is offered in manual or automatic transmissions.  The ES is equipped with a 222hp DOHC engine and comes with ABS standard and is offered with both transmissions as well.  The RT Twin Turbo comes with the potent turbo engine, AWD, and the Getrag 5-speed.  All can be picked up for relatively low cost, considering that the last year for production was 1996.  
     The 1992 Stealth RT Twin Turbo is an impressive piece of machinery and is pleasing in almost every aspect.  The only other downside to it, besides maintenance costs, is that it tips the scale at 3,800 lbs.  But hey, how many people are really going to try and turn it into race car?  It's more than enough to get you a few tickets.
