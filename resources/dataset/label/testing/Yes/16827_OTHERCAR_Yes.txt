            I was given my 1994 Chevy Camero as a 35th birthday present. I had wanted a convertible for as long as I could remember and my husband surprised me with this mean machine. Our convertible Z28 is just great. It had been owned by one very fussy man who made sure that every oil change was on time and it was in the garage during bad weather. I adore my car and treat it very well. There is something very special about being able to zoom along with the wind in my face and the radar detector on!
My only reservation would be to check the roof very carefully. Our roof guy has had more than a few early/mid nineties come in for new roofs. This set us back $640 -- so check that roof. Even with that outlay I wouldn't trade this car for any other! It rocks!<br><br>
