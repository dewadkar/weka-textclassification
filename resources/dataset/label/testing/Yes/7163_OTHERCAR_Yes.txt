            I bought my 1999 Dodge Caravan in May of 99.  We were on a budget so we were had planned on buying a used van.  We thought there would be no way we can afford a brand new mini-van.  But, nevertheless, we looked into pricing.  They were completely ridiculous.  They went as high as Thirty-thousand ($30,000.) but only as low as Eighteen-thousand ($18,000.), (tax, tag and title not included yet).

Then one day as i read the newspaper I saw an ad that read, &quot;1999 Dodge Caravan, starting at $14,000.&quot;  I was in shock.  I thought something must be very wrong with this van to be so cheap.  My husband and I went running down to the dealer with no expectations.  What we got instead was the surprise of a life time.  

Needless to say we bought the van.  It has power locks and power windows, cruise control and tilt wheel, a rear detaching seat, air-conditioning and a radio.  It seats 7, including the driver.  We have been so glad we bought it ever since, we have really never had a problem with it.  

I know, beggars can't be choosers but the down fall of this van is that it only comes in two colors, white and green.  The radio is without cassette player.  The seats aren't powered, as like the windows and locks, and it has no a/c in the back for the passengers.  

I still feel that this was a small price to pay for a van that handles and behaves so well.  My family and I love going on trips, so we keep up with all its maintenance and this van has never disappointed us.  <br><br>
