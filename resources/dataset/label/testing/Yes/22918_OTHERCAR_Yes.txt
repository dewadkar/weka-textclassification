            I bought a 1995 Jeep Wrangler four years ago, drove it off the showroom floor, and have enjoyed it every day since.  My Jeep was my dream car, save for maybe a Hummer.  There is just something about it:  not only can you climb trees with it, but few SUVs command the amount of attention from the opposite sex that the Wrangler gets.  Few SUV's, or other cars for that matter, offer the kind of open-air feeling that a Jeep attains simply by stowing the top behind the back seat.  Traffic jams become simply a chance to hop a curb or median and create your own lane.  So, while you're basking in the glory of being the kind of person who truly appreciates what it means to drive a Wrangler, here's what happens:

1.  At or around 80,000 miles, the exhaust manifold will develop a small crack.  Just a trivial little weakness in the metal.  When this happens, spend the $300 or so to get one of those jet-coated manifolds.  Otherwise, within the next year your Jeep will sound like NASCAR.  

2.  You will take the soft top off every opportunity you get.  The constant storage, folding and unfolding, and weather attacks will torture the top.  Local shops who specialize in off-road acessories will offer special chemicals and lubricants to keep the top in shape.  Invest the $20-30.

Hey, I love my Jeep.  Wouldn't trade it (well, maybe for another Jeep.)  Just be prepared for the little things when the miles start piling up.  <br><br>
