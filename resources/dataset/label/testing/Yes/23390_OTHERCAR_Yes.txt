            Kodak is still the chief marketer for digital cameras and the DC3800 strengthen my point even more adamantly. Small compact and heavy duty, this camera offers what a 1.0 Mega Pixel digital camera cannot. Coming at an impressive 2.3 Mega Pixel, the DC3800 however can still be improved. Not to say that it need those improvement, but it would definitely help. The following are information on helping you to decide whether this camera is for you.

Camera options:
There are numerous options on the DC3800. Do not be intimidated, however, by them. This camera is very easy to function even I had no problems. The functions on the LCD screen are as follows: About (information on the camera itself), Burst, quality (Best, Better or Good), Date and Time (sets date and time), Beep, Language (7 different languages for those international photographers), Format (Compact Flash Card option).


Power and Battery Life:
The camera supports 2 AA alkaline, which comes when purchasing the camera or Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. I would recommend carrying an extra battery or two. From my experiences, I realized now that the thing that sucks up the most battery life is the LCD screen. Oh, that thing DRAINS YOUR BATTERIES FAST!! That is one of the drawbacks, I think, of most digital cameras and especially this one.  There is also an optional AC adapter for the camera but it does not come normally with the camera unless you purchase a special bundle package. 

Flash:
There are 4 options for flash. Starts with automatic (automatic flash), fill, red-eye reduction, and off. The camera�s flash works well especially in certain dark areas. Surprisingly enough, such a compact camera running on two batteries can provide enough lighting for a room in a second. Kodak noted on the specs of the camera that the flash ranges from .2 to 2.5 meters. I have tried on farther distance, and to no avail, the picture ends up in the trashcan. When Kodak said 2.5 meters, they were not fooling around. 

Memory: 
The provided 8MB Compact Flash Card might be sufficient enough for �better� or �good� resolutions pictures. However, for more professional-looking pictures, I would recommend purchasing a larger Compact Flash Card, that would range from as low as 8MB to higher than 64MB, which is more memory than anyone would ever need. The reason is the memory it hogs when taking large resolution pictures. There are three picture settings as mentioned earlier. There are �Best� with 1,792 x 1,184 pixel resolution, �Better� also with 1,792 x 1,184 pixel resolution, and �Good� with 896 x 600 pixel resolution size. Since �Best� runs at a higher resolution, it will consume more memory from the Compact Flash Card and goes downhill from then on to the 2 lower resolutions. Normally, I can take around 15 pictures at �Best�, 30 at �Better� and 55 at �Good.� I normally set the �Best� for my important clear pictures such as Ebay items or presentations.  My eyes may be able to differentiate the differences between the three settings, but for those looking for a digital camera only for recreational purposes, the 8MB card is sufficient enough. Maybe, I would recommend, getting a 16MB would be a better investment towards prolonging your digital camera. 

The camera does not come with a direct connection from it to the computer. However, it does come with a USB interface Compact Flash card reader. This device is a work of art. I love the idea that I can still use my DC3800 and still transfer pictures to my computer. Normally, after finishing up one card, I would use the Card reader to upload the pictures to my computer and use a backup card for my camera. The time it takes to upload them is also very short, another convenient feature in getting this camera. 

Extras:
I think this is the coolest part of the camera, besides the USB Compact Flash Card reader. The connection from the camera to your video player using video output wires. After taking many pictures, you can relax and experience the moment all over again with the joy of not squinting your eyes. 

In conclusion, the Kodak DC3800 is state of the art digital camera. Plus, with the brand name Kodak, you can be sure that help is just around the corner. However, consider the extra addition of more Compact Flash Card Memory and extra investment on battery charger or the camera AC adapter since this camera eats up power. All in all, the camera is a decent camera for both professional and beginner photographer looking to venture into the digital world.
