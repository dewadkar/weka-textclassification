            Our 1998 Honda Accord is our third Honda and it didn't dissappoint us.  Previously, we owned an '88 CRX Si and a '94 del Sol Si.  The looks of the Accord EX-V6 sedan are a bit deceiving.  It really has no flair to it and the only indication of what is under the hood are the flat black dual exhaust tips.  Pop the hood, however, and get ready to be impressed.  Just one look at the 3.0 liter V-TEC V-6 and you know that this sedan has got some power.  The engine looks like it was plucked from an Acura NSX.  In actuality, it is a close relative of the engine in that legendary sports car.

The car is very quick and agile and the automatic transmission is smooth shifting.  Handling is surprizingly like that of a sports sedan although the stock tires need to be upgraded to something with a bit more cornering grip.  The 4 wheels discs and ABS bring the car down from high speed highway driving with ease.  I know this for a fact.  I came off the freeway at about 60 MPH onto an unmarked, 90 degree exit ramp and nearly ended up in the grass.  The combination of the Accord's handling and braking saved my car and the occupants.

The interior is extremely well laid out and the leather is soft.  My boss owns a Y2K Lincoln LS V-8 and, in my opinion, he paid $10,000 more for just a few more gadgets.  The Accord EX-V6 is luxurious and loaded with steering wheel stereo controls, moonroof, climate control, power driver's seat, and all the basic power items.  Unfortunately, Honda still charges extra for floor mats but a good dealer will throw them in.

At a bit over $25,000, the Accord EX-V6 is a great value.  There are flashier cars but you won't find a better combination of power, value, luxury, and quality in an American made (Marysville, OH) car for the price and the V-TEC V-6 doesn't require high octane gas like most of the new high compression, multi-valve engines.<br><br>
