            This was my cousin's first digital camera, and he has absolutely nothing to compare it to, but his biggest complaint with the RDC-300 was that unless you shot, the picture gets blurry. Kinda tough at parties and when you're taking action shots. But other than that I've had great success with it, the software is decent and the pop-up LCD display is great, I couldn't imagine owning a camera without one. A side note: I'd recommend for any buyer of a digital camera would recommend to invest in really good rechargable batteries -- the yellow Eveready kind have served me well.<br><br>
