            I presently own a 1995 Lincoln Towncar w/ 28,000 miles -- it is a GREAT
LUXURY ROAD CAR !  The best level of quality and luxury - great gas mileage 28 MPG hwy.  I have owned 4 previous Lincoln Towncars - 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991 models -- plan to buy a new 2000 Lincoln Towncar this summer !

The 1995 Lincoln Towncar drives great - very quiet and smooth - extremely
comfortable.  The level of luxury is top notch, the fit and finish is
superb and the appointments great.

The seats offer great support and are extremely comfortable.

The noise level is extremely low -- the 1995 Lincoln is extremely
quiet.

For the money, the LINCOLN TOWNCAR offers the BEST VALUE !  Anyone who wants the best value and reliability for the money should consider
the Lincoln Towncar.
