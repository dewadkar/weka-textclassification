            I recently purchased my 2001 Celica and am extremely happy with my choice. The car's performance certainly exceeds my expectations overall. It handles very well and what's not to like about 35 mpg on the highway? I took a 400 mile round trip shortly after getting the car and, at interstate speeds with the air conditioning on, the car virtually sipped gas. There was plenty of reserve power for entering the highway and for passing. The interior is very comfortable for a small car. The seats are contoured just right. Adjustments could be a bit more refined, especially height of the bottom cushion. I think this is just a matter of preference don't think the individual driver will have any trouble finding an optimum position. The sound system is very good with plenty of adjustments to find that "just right" sound. I opted for the 5-speed simply because I think it makes a car like this much more fun to drive. Heating and  air conditioning are almost instantaneous. There are plenty of storage areas for all that stuff we seem to carry with us. The rear seat backs fold down to extend the hatchback "trunk". Handling is great. I travel mountain roads quite a bit and the Celica's suspension makes driving these roads a pleasure. My car has a sun roof and with the roof fully open there is a bit of a breeze but nothing significant. A wind deflector would help but one is not built in and I haven't checked on after-market accessories yet. All in all, the Celica is a great little car. The price is affordable even with some of the more useful options. I am a convert from Volvo, having owned them for years. My last Volvo was so trouble-prone and unreliable that, based on past experiences with Toyota trucks, I decided to make a change. So far I'm glad I did.
