            I bought my first Cavalier,a pretty blue 1997. I loved it so much that when some crazy man hit me and totaled out my beloved car, I bought another one, a lovely red 1999. One of the reasons that I bought a Cavalier is because of the excellent gas mileage. Another reason would be that they actually are not that expensive and are still good to look at. Cavaliers drive good in bad road conditions, I've just figured this out in the past three weeks, we got nine inches of snow in two days. Also, the heat starts working really fast.

Driving a cavalier is like driving a sports car without having to the insurance for one. It is only a four cylinder but it can get up and go. I like to race people at stop lights.

You should buy this car if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a car, if you are single, or without children, and if excellent gas mileage is important to you.

You should not buy this two door car if you have children, it is very hard to get car seats in and out of the back seat. Also, this car sets pretty low to the ground. If you are older you might want to think of a car that sits higher off the ground. My parents have a hard time getting in and out. One more thing, if you are a tall person, you should probably look for something else, Cavaliers are pretty small.<br><br>
