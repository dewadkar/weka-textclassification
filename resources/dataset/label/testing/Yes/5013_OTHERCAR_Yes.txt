            I have had my Sentra just shy of a year now. I believe I have experienced as much in that year as with any new car. I have the SE model, which lends to a slightly sporty feel. Compared to my last car which also was 4 cyl, manual transmission, and similar engines, this one has great deal more "zip". 

When car shopping I had narrowed my choices to this or the Mazda Protege, same year. The cars offer some very similar qualities. I think the points which sold me on buying this particular car where all the little things; the many cubbies to store things, two lighter outlets, keyless entry, back seats fold-down, adjustable drink holders (for the Big Gulps), etc. These are all things I don't think are necessary, but I have grown very attached, and are now essential in any following car purchases.

This is the second time I have purchased a new car , and I can say that after a year I still cherish this one, much more than the last. It still drives wonderfully. The maintenance costs have been comparable. The gas milage is surprisingly high. What a treat! 

The only fault I have yet to find is the inability to replace the tires. Due to some bad luck I have had two flats on this car. The first time it took 3 weeks for the ordered replacement to come in. This time I am on 6 weeks and counting. This of course no fault of Nissan, or against the car at all. I believe this just to poor service by Firestone. (A review of them may follow someday.) Even visiting my Nissan dealer, and the local Firestone retail branch, it was not to expected any sooner. 

I can sum it by saying, had I known driving this car would be much fun to drive, I would have bought it instead of leasing, so I could spend more time on the road. 

--If anything happens in the future to change my opinion, I will certainly update this.
