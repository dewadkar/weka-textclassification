            For the average person, digital cameras are the way to go. With a nice digital camera and a good printer, you'll get more pictures for less money than the traditional way. The F410 is a good choice for most photographic needs. 


<b>The FinePix F410:</b>

Fuji is equiping the F410 with their all-new Super CCD HR feature. This allows the F410, with 3.1 million pixels, to create photos that are up to 6 million pixels (2816 x 2120). This allows you to print pictures with amazing quality at up to 11 x 14 inches. This is one of the best features of the F410, a vast improvement over previous FinePix models. 

It's a very light and stylish camera. The F410 is very portable and easy to use, even for beginners. But while it's simple to use, the F410 is versatile enough for advanced users. 

The delay between pressing the button and when the picture is taken is fairly short. You can partially depress the button and readjust or time it just right, then as soon as you fully depress the button the picture is taken. Some cameras delay for a second even after you fully depress the button to snap the picture. 


<i>Pictures:</i>
The Super Fujinon 3x optical zoom lens (3.6x digital zoom) takes great pictures. The lens delivers nice picture sharpness. The F410 has improved autofocus performance that allows for higher quality moving photos. There are no more excuses for bad pictures because with the F410, as with most digital cameras, you can view the picture as soon as you take it. You can preview your pictures and videos on the high resolution 1.5" color TFT monitor. 


<i>Movie Mode:</i>
Like most digital cameras, the F410 can record videos with or without sound. With sound you can record up to 98 seconds of video. Resolution is 320 x 240 at 30 fps. You can record audio ("Voice Memo") up to 30 seconds for picture notation. There is also a videoconferencing feature that turns your digital camera into a webcam.

<i>Storage/Transfer:</i>
The FinePix F410 uses XD memory cards and comes with a 16MB card included. Images can easily be transfered to either Mac or PC with the USB connection. There's no need to install software for photo transfers. The F410 comes with two software programs; FinePixViewer and ImageMixer. These are used to view and edit pictures and create picture albums on CDs. You don't even need a computer to print the pictures you take, most printers are now equiped to allow direct connections to your digital camera.

<b>Snap Shot:</b>

The picture quality is outstanding. Most people don't really need any more performance than what the FinePix F410 provides. It is a really advanced digital camera. The pixel enhancement that allows you to create images with 6.0 million pixels is amazing. The software that's included with the camera is pretty good. And best - it's easy to use! You can crop the pictures, reduce red-eye and use other editing functions. When you can, I highly recommend getting a higher capacity memory card. A mere 16MB won't last long if you want high resolution pictures.

Fuji makes some of the best digital cameras on the market. I really like the F410 and I'm sure once you try it you'll agree - this is the camera for the masses!
