            I'm so happy I went with my new Odyssey. Listed in no particular order are some of the features about it.

SEATS - I've heard some complaints about the comfort of the seats but I think they are extremely comfortable. Perhaps the comfort factor is related to size/build. The second row captains seats are great since I have two children. They are out of arms reach of each other, cutting down on the fights. The passenger side chair is dual position allowing the second row to act as a small bench if you prefer this configuration. The switch takes only seconds. The third row bench (the &quot;magic seat&quot; as Honda calls it) is fantastic!!!! I always dreaded taking the back seat out of my old Dodge Caravan. The Honda eliminates the awkward lifting as well as having to find a place to put it. Again, this takes only seconds to accomplish.

ENGINE - The 3.5 liter engine is powerful and quiet. Typical Honda. 

FIT &amp; FINISH - Again typical Honda. Very tight tolerances, excellent paint and the van just has a very solid quality feel.

AUDIO - The radio isn't nearly as bad as some reviews I had heard. I'm not really an audiophile though so perhaps my requirements are not as high as some. A CD player is a dealer added option. It's kind of spendy as are most factory audio systems. The better option of you are at all handy is to purchase the CD from one of the Honda dealers who does web retailing such as www.partscheap.com and do the install yourself

RIDE / HANDLING - Handles excellent. Doesn't have that truck kinda ride. Turning radius is very tight which is nice. Visibility is great out all windows. Parallel parking is rough though. The front end just disappears and is tough to judge where the bumper is. The rear window is rather short and also makes the rear tough to judge. Hopefully I'll improve with practice. 

CONVENIENCES - Lots of little cubbys and cupholders to put stuff in. Middle row passengers have to use the holders between the front seats. This is OK if adults or larger children are there but little kids can't reach. There really needs to be something either on the arm rests or the doors. I purchased the LX which is the lower of the two models. Even this bare bones version has most everything you could wish for. Power windows and locks, dual zone air, cruise, and anti-lock brakes. 

OVERALL - Overall I'm extremely happy with this van. It offers all the goodies I want along with Honda's reputation for quality. I'm confident that if I choose, this will be the last van I have to buy. My kids are 5 and 3 and I can see this lasting until they both have cars of their own.<br><br>
