            I used to have a little 2 door compact car but after having a baby in June my husband and I decided that we were in need of a larger family car.  We originally thought we would just buy a larger car, but after looking into the different models we decided we would like an SUV instead.  I quickly decided on the Rodeo because of the look and size.  Plus, I had researched and found out it is a durable, dependable vehicle.

So, off to the dealership I went...supposedly just to look.  Well, you know how those salesmen can be.  After choosing the model and color that I wanted and giving it a test drive, I was hooked.  I decided on the LS in a 2 wheel drive.  I got the upgraded package with the alloy wheels, 6 CD changer, and hood guard.  And it is all packaged into a nice, shiny, Metallic Silver.

I have only had this vehicle for a short time, but in that time I have learned to love this vehicle for what it is.  It drives like a car, but with the advantage of sitting up higher on the road.  The only thing that I dislike about this vehicle is getting into the back-seat.  The bottom of the doors are pretty narrow.  It is especially noticeable getting the car seat in and out.<br><br>
