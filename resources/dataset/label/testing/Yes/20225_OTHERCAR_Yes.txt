            We have had our 1999 Malibu for almost a year now and we love it! It is a great car! We haven't had one problem with it at all! 

We had a Honda Civic hatchback which was just too small once we had our first child. So we decided we needed more of a family car, but didn't want to go with a minivan. We liked the way the Malibu looked, so we thought we'd try one out. 

I immediately felt comfortable behind the wheel of this car. It is so easy to drive and very smooth. There is a lot of legroom in the back seat. I am pregnant with our second child now and I can still fit comfortably in the back seat with our daughter's car seat! And the trunk has a ton of room also! 

This car is perfect for someone looking for lots of room and comfort! And it looks nice too!
