            I got my chevy cavalier when I was 18 years old and in college. It was a great car then, it had plenty of room for my things and friends and it was sporty enough to make me love driving it.It has always gotten good gas mileige and have never had a probelm with it. I still love my cavalier, but now my two door is a little too small with having a child. Its harder to get him in and out of the car seat with just two doors. I think a four door cavalier would be wonderful for families with chidlren, but the two door coupe is just too small and too diffecult with carseats and babys!!<br><br>
