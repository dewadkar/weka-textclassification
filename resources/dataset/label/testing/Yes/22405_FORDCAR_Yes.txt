            Yesterday, I bought my first car. I have always owned trucks. But, because of health problems, I needed something small, and easier to drive. I just went from driving my husbands,99 Ford F350 crew cab dually, to this small car. It has so much more power than I ever imagined. We live on a mountain, here in Pa. It just flew right up it. I have owned trucks, that are a v8, that could never climb that mountain, that fast. I feel like I bought a sports car. 
I am very comfortable behind the wheel, everything on the dash is close enough to reach, but not so close you feel crammed against it. I am a very short person, and I have to sit close enough to reach the pedals, but I am not crammed against the dash at all.
I bought this car because of it's low price, and reliability. I got it fully loaded, with air, power windows and mirrors, automatic trans. and even an alarm. I never had one, so I think it's really neat. The price was $15,745. My payments are under 260 a month and I never have owned anything that cheap. It is a 4 seater, which is perfect for us,(two teenagers), it will be so easy to teach them to drive. 
There is nothing that I dislike about this car. I love it!<br><br>
