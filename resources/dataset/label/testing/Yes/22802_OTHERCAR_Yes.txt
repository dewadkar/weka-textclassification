            I purchased a 1999 Accent 3dr hatchback in April.  This is the second Hyundai I have owned, and I will continue buying cars from them.  The main attraction for me, besides price, was the incredible warranty.  All Hyundai cars come standard with a 5yr/60,000mi bumper to bumper, 10yr/100,000mi powertrain warranty along with a 5yr/unlimited mileage roadside assistance program.  The Accent is comfortable if you are not to tall.(I'm 5'9&quot; and I have plenty of room)  It is also great on gas.  I get around 30 miles to the gallon city driving and 35-40 miles to the gallon highway driving.  The price is also very reasonable.  You can get one for under $10,000.  The only downfall I have noticed, and this is an observation from owning my other Hyundai, is that these cars are very expensive to fix.(Approximately $4000 for a transmission)  However, with the warranty that comes with the car, you won't have to incur those expenses for quite a while.<br><br>
