                                         Toyota Land Cruiser

    This is a great car and I would expect nothing less. All Japanese made cars have great engines (very powerful and productive) and last a long time. I know this because I have had one for many years (it now has 175,000 miles on it) and it still runs smoothly. This car is very heavy duty if you are looking for a SUV this is the one of the only descent ones on the market. It has all time four wheel drive, a luxurious interior and a good-looking exterior (very smooth-looking). It is also very very safe because you are so high of the ground and weigh much more than most other cars. So if you are in the mood for a descent SUV and you are serious about it go pick up a Toyota Land Cruiser; I highly recommend it. <br><br>
