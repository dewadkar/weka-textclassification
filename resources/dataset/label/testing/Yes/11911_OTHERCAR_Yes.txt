            I've been a semi-professional photographer, and have my own 4x5, three 35mm cameras, a couple extra cheapies that I wouldn't care if I lost on vacation, and a Polaroid. I didn't think I needed a digital camera, but a friend encouraged me to at least try it.  I had been scanning prints to get .jpeg images for Internet sharing, and having print film developed into CD's so didn't really feel the need for a digital camera.  Yielding to the encouragement, I bought what (a few month's ago) was the cheapest digital camera I could find:  the Agfa 780C, for just under $200.

I love it.  It's easy, the Windows 95 serial connection is no problem, the software is dummy-proof.  The only change I've made was to upgrade the 2mb memory to 8mb. Instead of the (about) 12 good-quality photos, now I can take 45 at best-quality, or 330 at the lowest quality.  The batteries (4 AA) have not been a problem.  The flash is a bit slow to recover, and there is no zoom, but that hasn't really mattered.  I have been taking photos of indoor emergency dispatch centers, and the flash covers the entire room -- even large rooms -- with detail as good as I was getting from print film.  

The thing I like best about digital is that I can see immediately what the photo looks like.  The integrated screen shows the photo and gives you the opportunity to accept or reject the photo.  Or you can go back later and cull out the photos you want to delete.  I haven't used the macro feature, but the camera has three focal settings (macro, portrait, landscape), and these seem adequate.

Now that I'm hooked on a digital camera, I expect the time is not too far off that I'll trade up.  This has been a good, inexpensive venture into a new field, and I surely have no regrets.  <br><br>
