            Recently bought a used 97 sr5, V-6, five speed from a family member. The five speed, v-6 is extremely rare.  I love it. There is a definite performance advantage gained with the standard tranny.  It now has 77K on it and it feels like a brand new truck.  
On the pre-purchase inspection the mechanic was amazed with it's condition.  For instance, the brakes HAD NEVER been replaced in over 70K miles, yet they looked like they were fairly new. 

I love the look of this truck as well as it's off-road capability.  You just don't see many carmakers building true off road vehicles anymore.  Inherently, it rides rough. Just realize that it rides that way for a good reason.  If you don't plan on taking it off road at all, don't buy it.  Still, the steering and road manners make it a really fun ride on the street. And as far as construction goes, the truck is built like a vault and you can feel it. I can't believe I am making these comments about a truck that has 77k miles on it.

The cargo area and seating are similar to that in other SUV's but again, buy this one for it's reliability and off-road capability.  I am an avid over-sand driver on the beaches of cape cod.  It is laughable to see some of the vehicles that people take out there. You'll often see the Explorers, Rodeos and Cherokees bottoming out or getting stuck.  Never a 'Runner.<br><br>
