            Yes, I am a man and I drive a minivan.  If you are looking for high performance or/and image (read, form over function) then the Honda Odyssey is not for you.  Read no further.  Go buy a sports car that can fit 2 people (and if you only need room for 2 why are you even looking at a minivan), an SUV that cannot hold nearly as much stuff or people but costs twice as much, or a pick up truck that will let all of your stuff get wet when it rains.  You may not be able to do half as much as I can, but hey, your ego will be safe.

However, if you need a car that balances price, passenger capability, and hauling capacity, this is one great car.

OK here is my story - I bought my Odyssey right before Christmas of 2000.  I got a great deal (I paid $9,500 � blue book was $12,500) on the version (don't remember the name) that has the folding 2nd row rather than the one with the 2nd row that has to come out.  For anyone who does not know, this means that the 2nd row folds up flush against the front seats (two captain�s chairs) and the third row folds flat into the floor.  The result is that the entire cargo area is open from about a food behind the front seats all of the way back to the back gate.  Hence you can carry large pieces of furniture.

Well, a couple of days after getting it we drove it to my mother�s house 2 hours away � we took four adults, two 75-pound dogs, our luggage, and enough Christmas gifts for all of us plus about 10 other family members � all inside the van (none on the roof rack).  This thing can hold a whole lot of stuff.  It can also hold a whole lot of people � whenever a bunch of us at work go out to lunch, I wind up driving.  With all of the seats it can fit seven people in relative comfort.

This thing is also kid friendly.  We bought our Odyssey because my wife and I were trying to have a kid and, well, we succeeded.  While the Odyssey was a good car before, it is a great car now.  It is so easy to get the car seat in and out.  The front captain�s chairs make it easy for the passenger to reach back and take care of the little one if there is a problem.  And for any new parents, you just will not believe how much stuff you have to take for a weekend away from home � it is insane.  Basically, we just leave the second row up and the third row folded into the floor.  This allows plenty of space for strollers, diaper bags, toys, cribs, etc while still giving us a place to put the kid.  I would also point out that the gate is also at a fairly comfortable height for diaper changing.

As far as quality goes, it is a Honda.  I had it checked out before I purchased it (thank you, Car Checkers of America) and they told me that there were certain things that needed to be done as part of regular maintenance.  I finally got around to taking it to the mechanic and they verified that I needed to have these things done (even though it was running fine at the time).  I invested about $1,000 in a new timing belt, spark plugs, water pump, etc.  The mechanic now says that there is nothing at all wrong with this car and that it should go over 200,000 miles (it is now at 104,000).  It is a nice feeling having a mechanic tell you that your car is in such good shape.

However, the Odyssey is not perfect.  As I mentioned in my bitter diatribe up front, it is about as boring looking as you are going to find.  While my ego is not invested in my vehicle, I do get a little jealous of my friends driving �hip� cars sometimes.  Oh, well.  The car is also totally underpowered.  With just the kid and me it is fine, but add in a couple of people or some cargo and it is pathetic (then again, if you want sporty a minivan is not the way to go).  Also, the door locks on the Odyssey are supposed to have a chronic problem, but mine work fine even if they do have a tendency to cycle a couple of times even after I lock them (i.e., they lock, then relock, then relock).  Another issue is that the back seat, while adequate, is probably not great for adults on long trips (but I am usually driving so it is not my problem � he he).  Finally, the car perpetually fogs up inside whenever the windows are closed.  I have no idea why, but I have never seen a car that fogs up this much.  It is no big deal, you just turn the air conditioning on defogger, but it is annoying.

For those of you interested, I figure I get around 22-24 mpg in the city, Atlanta, which means lots of starts and stops in traffic.

Overall, I love this car.  It is not flashy, but I does exactly what I want it to do and it does it better than my friends SUVs and pick ups.
