            The 1993 Nissan Maxima SE has been the best car I have ever owned, and when I go to buy another car you better believe it will be a Maxima.  I bought my Maxima 5 years ago after trading in an Eagle Summit.  My parents had a Toyota Camery, and the neighbors had a Maxima, and I always like the Maxima's looks and speed better than my parents car.  So, when I saw that the Maxima was affordable, I jumped on it and never looked back.

LIKES:
1. Looks, the body style is classic Japan styling, even today it is very eye catching and sporty looking.
2. Power, the V6 engine is still one of the most powerful engines in its class.  Has great passing ability, and runs smooth as butter.
3. Options, the Maxima is very affordable at the GXE range, but with all the options the price does get higher but well worth it.  You have the feeling of driving a luxury vehicle without spending $30,000+.
4. Reliable, haven't had one problem with the vehicle since I bought it, new tires and routine oil changes.
5. Room, has plenty of room for a family of five and good trunk space too.

Dislikes:
1. No Cup Holder, I don't know what they were thinking.
