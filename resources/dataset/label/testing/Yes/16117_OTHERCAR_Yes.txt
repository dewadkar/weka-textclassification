                 There is so much talk today about sport utility vehicles.  Everyone who makes a brand of automobile is trying  to compete in this department.  I myself have wanted a BMW vehicle.  BMW seems to always sum up what a vehicle should be.  I have a different belief of that now.

     My wife and I recently purchased a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee limited.  The test drive sold me on this vehicle.  It is powered by a 235 hp V-8 engine, which in contrary to everyones belief is relatively easy on fuel.  I average 16.5 mph around town and 20mph rural driving.  The Limited is luxurious inside, equipped with power moon roof, his and hers climate control, power and heated leather seats, computer diagnosis readout, electric everything else.  It also provide an am, fm, cassette 10 cd changer infinity sound system that has no trouble filling the 5 seat capacity vehicle with great sound.

     Enough about the uptown stuff, Jeep is noted for one thing.  They wrote the book on 4WD.  This Grand Cherokee comes with a mean and solid drive train.  It is the only sport utility that still has a solid front axle.  The quadra trac all wheel drive system acts as an equalizer in all terrain.  Ask any of the competition if they truly want to compete with the Jeep and they will tell you no.  

     I would like to sum this all up the jeep is expensive, but you truly get what you pay for with this vehicle.  It is a quality built vehicle, very rugged, yet sophisticated.  I am very proud to drive this Jeep.  In my opinion no other sport utility compares.  I forgot one other thing, you will not get a better all around suspension on any vehicle.  Off road the Jeep is stiff and sturdy, on the highway it is soft and friendly.  You will not get a better ride out of a Cadillac.  I recommend the Jeep Grand Cherokee to anyone who is wanting a true sport utility vehicle.  And remember there is only one jeep.
