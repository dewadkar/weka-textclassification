            I have always liked the ES300, having driven/ridden in friends�� ES300s since 92. Finally, I��ve purchased one myself: the 2000 ES300. It��s been a few weeks now and I feel that, by far, this is the most refined car I have ever had the pleasure of owning. Many of the great features have already been discussed by other Epinion members, so I will not repeat the detailed SPEC of the car here :) Instead, I will use the space to talk about my own subjective opinion about the vehicle.

For years, I have been bugged by the criticism that the ES300 is nothing more than a disguised Toyota Camry. Honest to God it is not. However, I understand why people seem to think so. This is simply a natural phenomenon that a car manufacturer must face when they decide to open a luxury division. The same can be said about Acura/Honda, Infiniti/Nissan, or Audi/VW. And it is more apparent for the luxury division��s entry model vs the ��regular�� division��s best models.  

Everybody knows by now that the ES300 shares the Camry��s platform. The two cars also share certain components such as the power window switches, glass (you can tell by looking at the ��TOYOTA�� print on the glass), transmission shift, all minor stuff. The exterior is also similar (however, nowadays, most cars look very much like the Camry or Honda Accord). Some people tend to conclude too quickly that the ES300 is nothing but a Camry with the Lexus name. If you take the time to look at the details of the car, the differences are striking. Please, don��t just glance at them for 2 seconds and decide that they are too similar. Notice the difference and tell me which exterior you prefer. The ES300 is like a big cousin of the Camry who is richer, more handsome and does everything better. I am not putting down the Camry here. I am only arguing against those who claim that the ES300 is not worth the extra cost.

Feel the atmosphere when you sit inside, surrounded by beautiful walnut wood and high quality leather seats. Look at the back-lit instrument cluster light up as you turn on the engine. Be glad that you have the auto-dimmed rear view mirror when a truck is close behind you at night. Enjoy the clear sound of the stereo and the effective climate control (believe me. It can get really cold or really warm). Both systems have such simple controls that do not require you to have an university degree to learn (and it takes an university degree to design something like this). The beeping alarm that goes on when I unlock/lock the doors can be adjusted to a smaller volume which can be heard in public without being too obtrusive. The CD-changer is in the glove box and yet the glove box is still larger than my previous Acura��s. The exterior styling is aggressive and elegant at the same time. The 16�� wheels, standard on the 2000 model, add to the already handsome look. Oh yes, did I mention the ride? The quietness and the smooth suspension in any kind of road condition make the ES300 feel like an even more expensive car (even better than my old first generation Toyota Avalon which they say is a Lexus in disguise�K.)  Fit and finish is first class. ES300 is considered an entry-level luxury sedan. That is true. However, it is also true that it certainly BELONGS in the luxury division unlike many other cars that pretend to be (with fake wood trim, harsher ride compensated by larger engine as being sporty, leather/leatherette seats that crack easily, body structure that is fragile and squeaks�K; none of these is found in the Lexus)

Thought and Attention to details, soothing atmosphere of the interior, comfortable and quiet ride�K.. the ES300 excels in these areas. Granted, the components that ES300 and the Camry share are high quality stuff (which says a lot about the Camry being a great car). The ES300 simply has so much more content that it��s difficult for me to concentrate on the road while driving. I should just stop the car and stare at everything in admiration instead of doing it while I drive. I must admit also, that the acceleration and handling are not as good as the 2-door Acura 3.0 CL I traded in. Then again, the performance of the Lexus is already good enough for the purpose of being a safe and reliable primary family sedan for my wife and I. Take some time to look at each model in the market.  Decide whether the value matches the extra cost.  In my opinion, the Lexus ES300 is worth every extra penny (lots of them) that I spent in getting it instead of the Camry. I am truly enjoying this car�K.. I can��t find any fault with it even if I tried. It��s simply perfect for us.<br><br>
