            The subject is a 1998 A4 2.8 Quattro, which I have spent a lot of time in as both a passenger and a driver.  I am overwhelmingly impressed by this new generation of Audi.

EXTERIOR

This car is equipped with the sport package, which includes upgraded wheels and tires, as well as suspension enhancements which are generally not noticeable to an onlooker.  The current A4 body style is conservative yet attractive, and it blends well with other cars on the road, instead of standing out like some ornately styled cars do.  The paint is high quality, and shines nicely in both daylight and moonlight.  The compact size allows easy maneuvering through traffic and parking lots.

INTERIOR

Audi has put together a very competitive package.  The dash is not cluttered with levers and buttons, although Audi still provides very German controls.  There are a lot of foreign symbols, and sometimes the switches and buttons are hard to figure out.  For example, I still have not figured out how to operate the headlight washers (I know, a tragedy).  There is of course an owner's manual to learn the controls, but surprisingly those aforementioned headlight washers were not listed.  I am not sure how I feel about the wood accent along the bottom of the dash and onto the doors.  Maybe a little too &quot;classy&quot; for such an athletic sport sedan.  The seats are impressive.  They are firm and supportive, yet comfortable, and they do not require the driver/passenger to be a contortionist to get in or out.  The leather is supple and high quality.  Audi includes a three-spoke steering wheel with an airbag with the sport package, which is not that common these days and enhances the sporty feel.  The car has heated seats, obviously beneficial in the winter months as leather has a tendancy to be chilly.  The back seat is a little short on leg room, but the shoulder and head space is ample.  The back seat is well appointed, with map lights, headrests, large center armrest (with ski pass-through from the trunk), and shoulder belts.

PERFORMANCE

Quite simply, this is why you buy this car.  This car is equipped with the 2.8 V6 and a five speed manual transmission, as well as the Quattro all-wheel-drive system.  What a system it is.  The handling on this car is amazing, quite possibly the best I have driven, and that includes my 3 series BMW and my father's 1980 Porsche 911.  The car enters a turn and accelerates through, feeling like it is on rails the whole time.  There is no sensation of the car slipping away or getting loose in turns, and it is quite a rush to feel both the front and rear tires dig in a tight curve.  The V6 is powerful, but unfortunately with the all-wheel-drive weight, the power is not neck-snapping.  It is acceptable though, and the car is rated in Car &amp; Driver from 1998 as 0-60mph in 7.4 seconds.  The car is silent with the windows and sunroof closed, and the car feels amazingly solid on the road.  The brakes are confidence inspiring, and match the handling and the power well.

CONCLUSION

This car may not be for everyone.  It is a bit expensive, and the back seat is not as roomy as the Accord or Camry.  It is an amazing road car though, and people who can sacrifice a little room and pony up a few extra dollars will be amply rewarded with a thrilling driving experience.  I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for an entry level road car with thrills galore.
