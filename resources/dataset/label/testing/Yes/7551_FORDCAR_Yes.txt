            <i>In 2002 we reluctantly parted with our Expedition after nearly 95,000 miles (before the first scheduled 100,000 mile tune up!) and moved into a Ford Windstar.  I can honestly say we never had any major mechanical problems with our Expedition and believe it was one of the best vehicles we ever owned.</i> <b>THE FOLLOWING IS AN UPDATE TO A REVIEW I WROTE IN DECEMBER 1999 REGARDING OUR FORD EXPEDITION</b>

Our four children are grown - why would we choose an Expedition? As baby boomers we had owned Suburbans while our children were growing &#150 Our family loved to go camping and fishing, plus shopping for a large family required a larger vehicle. Well, we still love to fish and camp - only now we go in real style. 

The 1998 Ford Expedition came in two trim models, the XLT (which we bought) and the Eddie Bauer.  The main difference between the two models is paint choices and trim.  Although there are other seating arrangements available, our Expedition came with front bucket seats, center two person bench and one separate seat, and removable third row bench.  The one center row seat folds forward and flat for access to the rear bench.  They say it is a nine-passenger, but with the front bucket seats, it is actually an eight-passenger, and more comfortably a six.  Getting in and out of the third seat is a little difficult and the seating is cramped.  I would suggest the younger members of the family ride in the back.  The back seat was easily removable, which we often took advantage of when packing the vehicle for a camping trip.  We found the ride quite comfortable for all the passengers.

Our 1998 Expedition came with power seats, power windows, mirrors and door locks; front and rear air-conditioning, and lighted running boards.  Anti-lock disc brakes, child safety locks, remote keyless entry, and passive anti-theft system were standard. The overhead console was equipped with map lights, sun glasses holder, and bin for the garage door opener. The back passengers had their own controls for air conditioning and heating, eliminating the need to keep bothering the driver to &#147turn up the air.&#148  Our XLT came with the premium sound system and 6 disk CD changer, which we found was an enjoyable system with good quality sound.

Being 5ft 3in I usually have difficulty reaching the pedals in most vehicles.  This was never a problem for me in the Expedition, as I was able to move the power seat close enough without being against the steering wheel.  I also enjoyed being able to sit up higher than the rest of the traffic and having a good view of the roadway.  Steering and maneuvering was quite comfortable, although at first there were numerous times when I would take a turn too close to the curb.  

Since we often go boating or camping, we appreciated having the 4x4 model with towing package and the larger 5.4 liter V8 engine.  While it wouldn&#146t be the vehicle to go 4-wheeling in, it certainly can tow any boat or trailer, and won&#146t leave you stranded on some of the dirt back roads in the Arizona desert.  Climbing the mountains in Arizona with a full load was never a problem.  (Towing capacity is 8,000 pounds)
