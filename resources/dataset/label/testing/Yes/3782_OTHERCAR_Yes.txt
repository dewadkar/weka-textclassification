            In my opinion, this car is positively the best of the best in terms of high preformance convertibles.  I currently own a 1999 Estoril Blue BMW M3 convertible, and I amproud to say it is the most outstanding car I have evr owned.  
    The handling is first class, as good as any Ferrari or Porsche.  So is the braking, and the looks are first-class.  But my favorite thing about this car is the acceleration.  With a 0-60 time lower then the Porsche Carrera (which is nearly twice the M3's price), the torque and sheer engine power is superb.  
    Probably the only downside is the sparse and rather unluxurious interior, especially for a 50,000 dollar automobile.  But look for that change in the new 2000 M3.  <br><br>
