            I am a glass artist and needed a vehicle that would safely transport stained glass art but could also be used as a family passenger vehicle.  I had owned a Previa which was rapidly falling apart and felt I needed a new vehicle while I could still get something for the Previa.  I fell in love with the Rav4 from the first time I drove it.  To begin with, I am only 4'10 1/2&quot; tall and often can't see over the dashboard of vehicles or reach the pedals.  The Rav4 has enough adjustments in the seating to where I could do both comfortably.  Additionally, some seats on the larger vehicles are too long and hit me uncomfortably in the calves.  These seats were very comfortably configured.  I tested (and bought) the standard shift model.  The reason was that it was the most responsive vehicle I had experienced in a very long time.  Because I am small, I am obviously not into taking out seats for cargo and cargo space was extremely important to me.  The unique rear seat arrangement was the perfect solution.  You can fold the rear seats forward to where they are almost against the front seats leaving a huge space for rear cargo.  There is still enough space in front of the folded forward rear seats for me to fit about 15 sheets of raw glass. The ride is gentle enough to where I have never broken a single piece.  I have more useable cargo space in the Rav4 than I did in my mini-van!  The gas mileage on my Rav4 is 29-30MPG which is wonderful.  Negatives?  Very minor.  There is a lot of road noise making radio listening a little difficult.  This isn't too bad while you are driving but, unless you remember to turn down the radio, turning on the car the next time can really wake you up with the volume! I also had a problem with the paint when bugs got stuck to the front.  I didn't get them off fast enough not to have them burn into the paint.  The paint is guaranteed, but the down time is annoying.  Other than that, I have never been happier with any other vehicle.  I will replace my old Rav4 with a new one when the time comes.<br><br>
