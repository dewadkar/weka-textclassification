            I have owned my van 5 1/2 years, and I can tell you honestly, I have YET to call a garage and tell them I need to have it looked at for anything. And I use it everyday. I'm not saying it never needed brakes, etc. Normal wear and tear has been taken on my van, but other than that, nothing. I feel very lucky!

When my husband and I first considered a larger vehicle 5 years ago, we had just welcomed our first born child into the world. I was happily zooming around town in my Nissan Pulsar, and cramming my childs car seat into what they called the back seat. I knew it was time, but saying goodbye to my T-top, red, sporty car, was like saying goodbye to everything a cool car comes with. Oh well, I was a proud mom now, guess it was time I owned a mom vehicle. 

First I'll tell you what we were shopping for and how close Ford came to answering all of our needs with the Aerostar. We wanted:

*Power steering -- the handling is fine; I've driven other similar vehicles that were easier, but still, driving this van is effortless
*6 cylinder engine (for more power than my 4 cylinder)
*Good gas mileage (we knew not to expect miracles shopping for a van, though) 
*Reliable name (Ford has been very good to my family for a very long time, plus, sometimes finding a foreign dealer to get my Nissan fixed was really a pain. We wanted an American made car this time) 
*Power locks -- controls 2 front doors, side sliding door, and rear hatch from driver side
*Power windows -- controls both driver and passenger from driver side (middle bench seat has 2 manually sliding windows that's easy for small children to open and close)
*Room for 4 + comfortably -- 2 captain chair type front seats with arm rests, 2 spacious bench type seats in the rear, plenty of leg room 
*Air conditioning

Ford provided us with the Aerostar minus cruise control -- the only other thing I really wanted, but they had it custom installed for us after our purchase.

The decent things we enjoyed about this van that we didn't realize right away, was the fact that the back seat could be removed. In fact, you can move both the middle seat and rear seats if you want. We do not always need our last seat, but instead could use the extra room when going on vacation, for example. Even though removing or putting in the seats was definitely a 2 person job, it was not a difficult one. One easy lift of a lever or a click into a wide slot, and you were in business. One itsy bitsy change, though, could make it even easier -- make the seat able to fold down like some others I have seen and there's the extra room you need. 

I also like the way it drives. The ride in my van is especially smooth. Between the shocks at work, comfy seats, and overall high performance, it's quality can be considered top notch. I also thought that I would feel like I was driving a bus going from a sporty car to a minivan, but it didn't take too long to get used to A LOT more space, and now I would never go back. I like the idea of not being cramped and also having a lot of metal around me!

I wish I could tell you how well this van does on gas, but neither my husband nor I are good at this. . .I can tell you that at $1.50 per gallon, it takes about $25 to fill 'er up, and a full tank gets me approximately 400 to 500 miles or so (less if all city driving). Manufacturer's page listing is 17 MPG city/24 highway. 

There are a few things about this van I would change if I could. The first would be being able to handle snow covered roads better. With rear wheel drive, it's not the easiest to manuever in the snow. I have never had an accident or even a close call because of snowy roads, but I think it's because I've been extra careful, not because this van is so reliable in bad weather.  
   
Another change I would make, but this is minor, if I could redesign this car is compartment space. Even though there is a place to set 2 beverages, most tall drinks will spill when making turns (by the way, the carpeting is unbelievably absorbing! ;-). I would have made the compartments deeper and then added more space for extras (like tapes, tissues, etc.). My husbands Blazer also has a compartment for sunglasses, which is something I wish this van did. 

Another thing I would change is having vents in the rear of the van. On a scale of 1 to 10 in importance, though, this would rate low, like a 2, because the van really does a super job of cooling down/heating up with the vents only in the front, but think of the comfort you could have with rear vents -- it would really be a luxury. 

There is a dial in the back that controls the radio stations, but I'm not sure yet if this is a plus or a minus. My son discovered this once and had a little fun with me while I was finding a station that I liked. I didn't realize he even knew what this was for, but lo and behold he did! I guess if I didn't mind that he chose the music selections, it would be easier for everyone if he used his own dials rather than had me search for him. On the other hand, if I want a particular station on, all it takes is one touch of a button for him to change it. . . .we shall see. . . .

Oh, and I got into a minor accident a few months ago, so now it not only runs like new, it LOOKS like new ;-) and the airbag works, too. 

I'm sorry that Ford doesn't make the Aerostar anymore. If and when we need a new van, I would have picked a new Aerostar again! I believe what they make now in a similar minivan is the Windstar, but I remember it's a much higher price than the Aerostar was. If you're looking for a reliable used car, I would definitely  recommend this vehicle to you, you will NOT be sorry! <br><br>
