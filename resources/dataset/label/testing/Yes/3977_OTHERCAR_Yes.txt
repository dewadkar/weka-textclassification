            My Saturn SL2 has just rolled over 20,000 miles. It's been through hell. I drive a car as hard as the best of them. My Saturn has been offroad, onroad, and everywhere in between. The front-wheel drive offers excellent traction in dry and wet/icy weather. Since I live in Asheville, NC, in the Appalachian Mountains, we experience snow on the higher elevations, and when I need to drive in the bad weather, I don't feel unsafe in any conditions, and that's a feat I thought nothing other than an SUV would perform. 

Additionally, my Saturn SL2 has impressive acceleration/handling capabilities. Since the vehicle weighs only 2400 lbs, and it has an optional 125 hp 4-cylinder, the car gets to 60 mph in about 8 or 9 seconds. This is considerably quick for a 1.9 liter engine. Also, with the upgraded tires I put on my Saturn, I have been able to handle like I was in a rear-wheel drive sports sedan. 

The braking on my Saturn is also above average. However, I do wish the maker placed standard 4-wheel disc brakes instead of the two front disk, and two rear drum. Besides that, this 2400 lb car stops in a considerable distance. 

One of my only complaints for the vehicle is that the rear seating is not adequate for three people who are average sized, and that's not considering if you have larger people riding. I'm usually the one who drives around on the weekends with friends, and I can only fit two of them in the back, comfortably, yet there are three seat belts, and the car is designed for five people to fit, including the driver. 

Another plus is the dent-resistant panels that are standard on all Saturns. I think this is one of the most useful features a car company could place on their cars. How many times have you been to the supermarket, and you've had a cart run into your car, or have somebody tap your vehicle just enough to dent it slightly, but not enough to cause a commotion over? I don't worry about all that when I drive my Saturn. If a cart hits it, the paint doesn't chip, and the doors don't dent. 

In conclusion, my 2000 Saturn SL2 is a high-quality vehicle that is available to you at an inexpensive price. I recommend this car to anyone that needs a car they don't want to worry about all the time.
