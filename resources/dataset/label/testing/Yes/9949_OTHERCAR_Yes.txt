            I bought my 1994 Geo Prizm LSI two years ago with 80,000 miles on it.  I chose it because reviews said it is essentially the same as the Toyota Corolla but with worse resale value.  That's true.  I did not pay much for the car.

The car is four door with a 5 speed stick shift and an 1800cc engine.  It has plenty of pep and handles well.  It has two air bags and ABS braking.  The storage space is good, especially with the fold-in back seat panels.  Since I got the car, I've put in a new generator and a new battery; the power steering also needed some work.  The mechanic said the timing belt and brake pads needed to be replaced, so I did that too.  Throw in a couple of new tires.  Still, the car has cost me about $6500, including everything.  It gets 31 mpg town/highway average.  (I don't drive it all that much; in two years, I've only put 15000 miles on it.)  It's great to park in small spaces.  I expect that it will last another five years.

Disadvantages: If I wanted to sell it, I would not get much, especially if you compare it to the almost identical Corolla.  It is a small car, not easy for old or arthritic people to get into and out of.  The back seat is not very comfortable.

I'm very happy with the car and would buy another Geo/Chevy Prizm in a minute.<br><br>
