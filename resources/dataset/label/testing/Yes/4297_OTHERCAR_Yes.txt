            My license plate says &quot;Dt bug me&quot;...that's because I'm happy as a &quot;bug in a rug!&quot;.  I am tickled electric blue with my new bug. 

 I have the automatic 4 cylinder, and I was at first concerned about not having the pick up that I was used to, but low and behold, it's enough for me.  I can just scoot around, and park anywhere! 

 I was also concerned that I wouldn't have enough trunk space since I am a sales representative, and have to carry lots of stuff.  That's not a problem either!  In fact I have lots more trunk space when I put my back seat down, than my husband has in his large size car.

 This car has great breaks!  It'll stop on a dime.

  The &quot;bugs&quot; that I don't like about it however are:  the driver's side has a serious blind spot.  The front left roof support beam and the mirror, totally block your view when making a left turn. I feel very uncomfortable with this. 

I have a faulty CD player that won't mix CD's at random.  I've been told by my dealership that it is working properly, and that VW say's it's supposed to work this way.  Not according to the manual that came with it! 

 I would love to have automatic seats.  That would definitely be a plus.  And the &quot;cupholders&quot; aren't cupholders.  They're change holders!  The gas mileage is not as great as I expected it to be, but I can live with it. 

 I would not recommend this car to a large person, even though for a beetle it's very roomy.  I believe that it is a very safe, reliable car, and it's so fun!!  Course, it could be better if they'll get the &quot;bugs&quot; out.  And I want a spoiler on mine!!  <br><br>
