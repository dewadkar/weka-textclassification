            I bought my Isuzu Stylus in July of 1991 new. It was the first car for under $10,000 with a drivers side airbag. For a sedan, I thought it was a pretty sporty little car. I thought it was just right as my first &quot;new car&quot; purchase. The car I was trading in was also an Isuzu, the I-Mark, which I had bought used with 70,000 miles and had not one problem with, so Isuzu seemed the way to go. 

I loved almost everything about the Stylus. The model I bought did not have air conditioning, or cup holders, which seemed to be the only drawback. It drove like a sports car, handled well with its Lotus suspension, and had a tight drivers area, easy shifting. I kept the stock stereo, but for only having 2 from speakers, it sounded great. To me anyway. Always wanted to add a cd player, but never got around to it.

I had this car from 1991 until 1999 and the only trouble I ever had was that the front drivers side cv boot tore twice, and the brakes squeeked a lot although nothing was wrong with them.Not bad for a car with 86,000 miles on it.

I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a reliable, sporty and fun to drive used car. They are not in production any longer though so one might be hard to find.

Happy driving, and don't forget to buckle up! Friends don't let friends drink and drive.
