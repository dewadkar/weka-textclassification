            I picked up my brand-spankin-new F350 XLT LongBox SuperCab SRW PowerStroke 4x4 about 3 weeks ago and I've got nothing but good things to say about it.

The diesel engine is fantastic for towing.  I use this truck to pull my Land Rover around on a flatbed and I can climb grades like there's nothing back there.  This motor also gets pretty good mileage, though not as good as I'd hoped.  I've been seeing about 15-18 MPG depending upon conditions.

The downside to the diesel is that it's a&gt; more expensive to buy, and b&gt; really loud.  My I don't think my neighbors like the fact that it sounds like I'm firing up a Freightliner every morning when I leave for work.

The interior is spacious and comfortable.  If you don't slide the front seats all the way back, there's room in the half sized rear area for real people, not the midgets they usually have in mind when they're desiging extended cabs.  I had a friend back there for an 8 hour drive and she didn't complain at all about it (actually, she got the sweet deal because she could lie down, but whatever).

I have to sand bag the bed when I'm not carrying a load because the springs are pretty stiff when it's empty.  Not a big deal, but certainly something to be aware of.  I went with the one ton because I figured that someday I might carry a cab-over camper.  If you don't need the load carrying ability, I'd definitely go with the 250.

I've got the heavy service suspension, and you really do need to get running boards with this sucker.  I don't have them yet, and it's a chore for me to climb into this truck.  I'm 6'2&quot;.  My mother (5'6&quot;) finds it nearly impossible to get in.

This is a really expensive vehicle when you get the diesel and a reasonable compliment of options.  By the time I was out the door, I'd paid about $38,000.

Complaints:
When the center-front seat back is down (acting as a center console), anything you put under it on the seat will slide back and fall off the seat onto the floor behind.  This means there's really no good place to put things like cell phones where they can be heard, and readily accessed.  I've got to come up with a solution for this one.

I got a bunch of slushy, gravely snow splashed on the side of the vehicle, and when I later went to roll down the window, the sand got between the seal and the glass and scratched it all to hell.  You'd think they could build a seal that actually kept the sand out.&lt;/b&gt;<br><br>
