            For the last 6 years I have been privilege to drive a Corolla Toyota. Now with my lease being up in 4 months I have to make the decision of what car should I lease or purchase.
My first Corolla was leased in 1993. Just one look and I fell in love with the car. The size was perfect, it was compact but there was more room for comfort than most cars available, even the price was reasonable. For the three years I had it and over 46,000 miles my Corolla still drove as if it were a brand new car. In three years I never had a mechanical problem, the air condition was perfect until the end and the design kept it's sexy look all through the years. When my lease was up I did not hesitate to even think what I should get next - another Corolla Toyota. I was just as fortunate with my second Corolla as I was with my first, always dependable, comfortable and drives superior to most cars. In 4 months I have to turn in my Corolla for a new car. I have been test driving and looking around for a car like it. The new Toyota's are not designed as the previous ones, they are smaller, not as comfortable and the exterior design just lost that &quot;look&quot; that made the Corolla Toyota so desirable. I hope that this is only temporary just like the New Coca-Cola was and they bring back the original Corolla Toyota that needed no improvement. <br><br>
