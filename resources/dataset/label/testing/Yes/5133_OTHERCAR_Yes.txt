                     I recently purchased a 2000 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab truck, and I love it.  It came with a 4.7 liter V8 engine that is very powerful and also very fast.  The truck also came with CD and cassette, a graphic equalizer, Infinity speakers, and power bucket seats.  The truck is quite spacious, and that is a good thing for 6'6&quot; guys like me.  The back seat also seems to be spacious, although there is a little less room behind my chair.  However, for any normal sized person, the front and back seats come with ample room.  The truck is easy to load, both in the bed and the back seat.  The back seats fold up to provide extra space, which often comes in handy.  Another good feature is the cup holder setup.  This comes with two regular sized cup holders, and also a thoughtfully oversized holder for large drinks that have always been a pain to hold on to in cars.  The truck tows easily and well, and handles well under all conditions.  Overall, this truck has everything a person needs, because it has the space of a good-sized car along with the carrying capacity of a truck.<br><br>
