            I recently had the pleasure/burden of buying a used vehicle. I was in the market for something larger than my 2 door civic, but still manageable. I test drove everything from a Toyota 4 Runner to the bigger Dodge Durango. The shining winner in my eyes was the Chevy Blazer.

The Chevy Blazer that we test drove was a 1996, 4 Wheel drive, 4 door model that sold for about $19,000 with 50K miles on it. The first thing I noticed was how quiet the interior was compared to the other SUV's in it's class. It came with everything I would need at this price. Air, power everything, and a CD player with premium speakers. I was surprised at how much room the back would hold when the back seats folded completely down. More than my full size Chevy truck.

The only down side of this vehicle would be the Trade In Value. In our area (Oregon) 4 wheel drives are a dime a dozen so you should plan on keeping this rig for at least a year or more or you won't get your money out of it.

All in all if your looking for a Sport Utility Vehicle that is not as big as a Suburban or such but bigger than the little 2 wheel drive 2 door runts driving around, the Chevy Blazer definitely deserves your attention!<br><br>
