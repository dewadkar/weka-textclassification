            I recently set out to find a replacement for my aging Subaru Legacy station wagon, and since my wife doesn't care much for wagons we ended up looking at larger vehicles and settling on the RX300. Along the way we also looked at the Subaru Outback, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Toyota 4Runner, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Infiniti QX4, Mercedes ML320 and the Ford Escape. 

My wife really liked the Infiniti QX4, but both the EPA and independent reviews say it gets lousy gas mileage so there was no way I was going to buy that. I would have been perfectly happy with another Subaru, but it turned out that used ones with all the options cost almost as much as used RX300s, so that helped tilt us toward the more luxurious Lexus. I would have also considered the Toyota Highlander, since those get better mileage in the 4-cylinder version, but the Highlander currently costs more used than the RX300 so that was an easy decision. We briefly considered the Mercedes ML320, but it turns out that's made in Alabama and has questionable reliability. The Ford Escape also could have been a contender but not at the prices they're selling for, plus I read reports that they can stall out unexpectedly at city driving speeds. 

So anyway, we ended up with the RX300. Pluses include comfortable leather seats, nice stereo system, a good view of the road (except slight blind spot on driver side), decent engine power, and the sense of panache that comes with owning a luxury vehicle. I also like the spacious feel of having a moon roof and drive with the inside cover open most of the time. Handling is smooth and easy for a vehicle of this size, but it's definitely not as nimble as smaller vehicles I've owned in the past. 

Biggest minus so far is the gas mileage, which seemed alarmingly low at first in stop-and-go traffic but has since worked out to an average of about 20 MPG. That's not bad for a vehicle this large but still less than I'm used to, so if this is an issue for you be sure to look carefully at other alternatives. My recommendations to consider if you want an efficient five-door vehicle would include the Subaru Outback, Honda CR-V, Toyota Highlander and the new Toyota Matrix. 

Some reviewers have suggested the RX300 could use even more engine power, but I find it to be quite adequate in that regard. Acceleration is smooth and respectable at both low and high speeds, and although it doesn't have quite the "oomph" of a larger engine it's fine for the size and intended use of this vehicle. If you want to drag race someone in a fancy sports car or tow your yacht at 80 MPH over the nearest mountain range, get a vehicle designed for one of those purposes. Otherwise the RX300 is a fine performer for everyday use. 

I don't expect to take this vehicle off-road much so won't comment on its capabilities in that regard. I have noticed that the 2WD version I bought can spin out the front wheels rather easily, so 4WD is probably a good idea even for city driving.
