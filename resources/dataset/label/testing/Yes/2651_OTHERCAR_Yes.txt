            Oh yeah!  I came back to the Honda CRV.  My wife and I originally owned both a 1997 and 2000 model CRV.  CRV stands for comfortable runabout vehicle.  Well, that is definitely true.  We traded our last CRV in for a 4-door 1997 Honda Civic.  The Civic got 35- 40 miles per gallon.  The CRV gets 20-25 miles per gallon.  The Civic is a good solid vehicle.  We even took it on vacation to Florida from Illinois. It ran great.  No complaints in that
department.  But, being six foot two and my wife at five foot nine, we decided we needed a little more comfort.  Riding in the Civic is sort of like sitting on the ground. It is also a little difficult to get in and out of the little Honda.  We remembered our CRV days.  Yeah, the good old days!  

Well, we are back in a CRV.  I think one of the greatest things about it is the leg room in the
back seats.  It is also very easy and comfortable to get in and out of. And, we can see the road.  Road trips are fun for four or even five people.  Power is adequate.  And, I will appreciate the four wheel drive this winter living Illinois and working in Missouri.  

Nostalgia?  Comfort?  Bargain?  All three played a major part in our return engagement.  The vehicle is highly rated by consumer magazines.  It is reasonably priced for SUVs.  And, don't forget about the built in table in the back!  We actually have used it for picnics.

I strongly recommend this vehicle for everyday driving.
