            I have owned a Chevy blazer for the past year and a half and I absolutely love it.  The only way I would go to anything different is to buy a full size blazer or suburban.

Actually, I was surprised with this vehicle as an anniversary gift.  My husband and I had talked about getting one and test drove a few to get the feel for what we thought about them.  I have always loved chevy trucks and been very satisfied with their performance and handling. 

However, after my first child I decided I needed something easier to get myself and my child into.  The blazer was the answer.

It has ample room, incredible comfort and the speed and handling you expect.

Initially I was somewhat dissatisfied with the lighting to the back seat area.  It had no dome light in the mid section of the vehicle.  The front passenger section and rear hatch section were well lit though.  After purchasing the vehicle and discussing this with my husband, chevy recalled the vehicle for the purpose if installing a light in this section.  Apparantly, many had the same issue!!!  Wonderful, now it has
plenty of light when needed.  (to find that toy that has fallen behind the seat!!!) 

The chevy Blazer has good pickup and speed for those necessary situations when you find yourself behind someone driving too slow.  The ability to take yourself in and out of four wheel Drive on demand is definitely a plus.  it also enables you the confidence and trust you need for those
testy wintery days.  Trust me, I deal with that a lot living in the Midwest.

The Chevy Blazer has a lot to offer and it delivers what you expect.
The ride is nice and comfortable, both front seat and rear.  Noise isn't a problem as it's quiet inside.  The variety of options are a real bonus.
I have the lift up rear hatch which is invaluable to me.  The other option for the rear hatch is a pull down door, much like you find on a truck.  I didn't choose this option as I felt it may be difficult to reach over to get things out of the back. i.e. groceries, luggage. They also offer a sun roof.

The sun roof allows light and fresh air in. It's a great option and one I recommend.  It can be positioned to variable degrees which is an especially nice option.  You can even leave the sun roof closed and still open the protective cover to let in
an abundance of light. It's a great option that I and my children truly enjoy.

This is a great vehicle, with plenty of room for those who like to travel
or have a large family. My husband is 6'3&quot; and has plenty of room to have a comfortable ride.

Another great feature is the ability to fold down the rear seats.  For those people who carry a lot of luggage or gear it really adds space to what you can pack in the back.

I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone and everyone.  It's a pleasure to drive.
