            Want a beautiful, sleek, work of art to drive around? Then this is the car. In addition it has power, is easy to maneuver, is great on the highway and in town, and, unlike Cadillacs and Lincolns, will fit into parking spaces. The interior is luxurious and comfortable and the sound system rocks. If you like a high profile this beauty will get you a lot of attention. Heads turn where ever you go and people even stop and ask, &quot;What kind of car is that?&quot;  Usually they think it's a Jaguar.

The J-30 is not a large car, I guess you would call it mid-sized. The front is very comfortable, the back is comfortable for two adults or three small children. The leather seats are very easy to take care of and have survived my son and all his friends and still look great.

In the five years that I have owned this car it has rarely been in the shop and then only for minor things- window motor, skipping CD player- and each time the warranty covered the work and they provided a loaner.
I have an extended 100,000 mile warranty and they provide roadside service 24 hours a day.

My only complaint is the trunk is too small. You can not get a set of golf clubs in it nor much luggage. It is adequate for groceries and normal everyday stuff. I bought a black one, and it is gorgeous, but I'd buy pearl if I could do it again cause I hate having to wash it constantly(I live in the desert and it's covered in dust as soon as its driven).

Overall the J-30 is wonderful and provides far more power than you will ever need, is very reliable, lovely to look at, and a joy to drive.  <br><br>
