            (Author's Note:  This opinion revised and updated January 29, 2002.  See addendums at the end of this review.)

It's well known in the auto industry that the Ford Mustang far outsells both the GM arch rival Camaro and Firebird models combined. But that fact alone is one reason why you should consider buying the Pontiac Firebird - in particular the Ram Air Trans Am flavor of this sports car.  If exclusivity is an important factor in your purchasing decision you certainly won't find yourself exchanging nods with another "Me Too" Mustang, Corvette or Camaro driver at every corner. The Ram Air Trans Am makes bold statements about performance, visual aesthetics, interior amenities and safety that no other modern day muscle car can match for the money.  

This review is based on the 1999 30th anniversary car but a prospective buyer can receive essentially the same bang-for-the-buck minus the special anniversary graphics by looking for the WS6 performance package in a 2000 model. One step on the throttle of this car and you know you've made the right decision.  Driving a car that has twice the horsepower of everyday vehicles takes some getting used to, but that extra get up and go is a boon when it comes to merging in traffic or getting across that busy intersection. While idling at that stoplight you'll appreciate the distinctive muscle car burble of the 320 horsepower engine - that is if you aren't rocking out to the superb 500 watt, 10 speaker Monsoon sound system. Most controls and switches for the Pontiac are within easy reach of the driver. Instrumentation is bold and easy to read - day or night.  Seats are comfortable and have a myriad of adjustments to suit the needs of individual drivers.  Trans Am back seats are a tight squeeze for adults but easily cradle two kids for long or short journeys.

As you might expect driving the Trans Am demands your full attention especially in traffic. Any corner is a candidate for tail-end kick-out. Course correction after such a maneuver is a no-brainer. Lift off the gas and point the nose where it should go and the car behaves as well as the next lane's Honda....the Honda that is, of course, quickly disappearing in your review mirror! 

On the highway the TA is surprising civil and returns a decent 20 miles per gallon. On long or short curves - at speeds most cars struggle to achieve on straight aways - leave the Trans Am begging for more.  You'll swear that GM has figured out how to make rubber and asphalt magnetically attractive after a few roadtrips in this car. 

If you enjoy open air motoring but don't want to dole out the extra cash for a convertible - go with the optional t-tops and you won't be disappointed. With the roof on, the tinted glass looks sharp and provides a decent view - whether that be puffy cumulus clouds or star constellations - day or night. Removing and storing the panels is a less-than-a-minute operation.  Unlock the panel, flip a large lever, lift, pop the trunk, slide in the panel, pull one more lever - done!  Your trunk space will be pretty much nill but the trade-off will be the best-looking, bad boy, t-topped equipped vehicle on the road. Guaranteed. The exhiliration of driving with the tops off can't be described in words - it has to be experienced. And even at speeds that might put your backside in the local pokey you won't find your hair blown to pieces. (Your long haired girlfriend might differ however.)  

Perfection eludes the Trans Am - as it does with any other vehicle.  The equalizer controls for sound system are only for the tiniest fingers, the extra AC outlet located under the hand brake is clearly an engineering snafu, and the ugly bulge on the front floor passenger side detracts from the otherwise handsome interior. Other complaints are probably in order, but overall the Trans Am is an exceptional vehicle.  As this reviewer's 6 year-old-daughter summed up on her first jaunt in the TA, "This car rocks Daddy!" And that, ladies and gentleman is what the Pontiac Trans Am is all about.

UPDATE:  February 2000

The TA has developed an annoying squeak in the suspension system and a hiccup in the exhaust that doesn't sound right. But if past experience with the Pontiac service department is any indicator, I suspect I'll have no problem getting these items taken care of. Last stop they replaced a loose rubber piece on the T-top with a more durable component.  Other than that?  This is an amazing vehicle - inside and out.

If GM nixes the F-body as the rumormill has it and you opt to purchase one of the rarer birds such as the 30th Anniversary editions reviewed here (I've seen several at auction recently) you might have a collector's item on your hands. But if you are lucky enough to find one?  Be prepared for squeals, dropped-jaws, questions, positive comments, thumbs up, envious stares, hoots and hollers from every other driver and passenger on the road - especially with the t-tops off. And you'll get them from 6 year old kids riding in their parent's SUVs on up through retirees in their Lincolns. The 30th Anniversary Trans Am elicits and rightfully deserves this type of attention. 

May 2000 

The squeek is gone and so is the exhaust hiccup.

The "Change Oil" light glows when I first start the car - this began right after the oil was changed and yes I've tried a reset - but blinks out after the car warms up.  I'll address this problem my service rep at the next maintenance stop.  

At the car wash the T-tops seem to have a mind of their own. Sometimes they decide to leak slightly - other times not at all.  This seems to be a function of the angle and position of replacement on the roof, whether or not you roll the windows up first, and how you hold your tongue - the proper sequence eludes me so far. 

January 29, 2002

How time flies! So still does the car! The TA now has 31,000-plus miles on the odometer and is still pulling strong. The car has a few nicks and dings here and there due to the inevitable effects of ageing - but it also has stayed out of the repair shop in the interim.

The biggest problem? Keeping those white leather seats clean! They are also starting to show 31,000 miles of wear as well. There are no discernable cracks or other problems with the interior.

Just replaced the tires yesterday with a set of the Toyo Proxima TS1s. (An epinion review of those babies are in the works.)
