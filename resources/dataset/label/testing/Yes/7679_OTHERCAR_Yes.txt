            The all-new Mercury Marauder, based on Ford's Crown Victoria/Mercury's Grand Marquis, has its own look.  It comes only in black and has a blacked out grill, with "smoked" headlamps.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>: The new Mercury Marauder does not set any styling statements, in my opinion.  The 18-inch high-polish chrome wheels, look great!  The fact that it only comes with black, high-gloss paint ensures exclusivity, but I would like to see a wider color palette available.  The "smoked" headlights and black grill add an aggressive, sporty look, but to me, it is still looks too much like a Mercury Grand Marquis.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The Marauder is noticeably louder than the "standard" Grand Marquis.  The exhaust rumble from the V8 is muted (as compared to a Mustang), but is far from quiet.  Ford intentionally made it sound like a muscle car with two 3-inch exhaust pipes.  The Marauder's gauges are very stylish and even have extra gauges.  Unlike the Grand Marquis, the Marauder has a floor shifter.  Leather upholstery is standard in the Marauder, and front seats are very comfortable.  I would like to have more lateral support in hard cornering, though.  The rear seats are spacious even for 3 adults across, but the cushion feels a little too soft for me.  There are tons of standard features including automatic climate control, power windows and door locks, a 100-watt AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player, cruise control, adjustable accelerator and brake pedals, and remote keyless entry.
 
<b>ENGINE</b>: The Marauder is powered by a 4.6-liter DOHC V8 engine that produces 302 horsepower at 5,750 rpm.  Torque is rated at 318 lb./ft. of torque at 4,250 rpm.  Those numbers are very impressive, but considering the fact the Marauder weighs 4,165 pounds (208 pounds over a base Grand Marquis), it does not feel as fast as the numbers suggest.  The transmission is an electronically-controlled 4-speed automatic.  It shifts pretty smoothly and rarely hesitates to downshift.  I averaged 13.9 mpg on the recommended premium fuel.

<b>HANDLING</b>: With larger, stickier tires, the Marauder handles pretty well for such a large car.  Body lean, however, is improved only slightly due to the added weight.  Nose dive is still noticeable but not alarming.  I would like to see stiffer springs for less lean and dive, though.

<b>RIDE</b>: The Marauder firm suspension feels jittery to me over sharp bumps.  Otherwise, I did not notice any annoying "float", and smaller bumps are easily absorbed.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: The Marauder has had no sign of any problems or glitches so far.

<b>VALUE</b>: The new Marauder is a perfect example of what happens when you combine big-car luxury, with muscle car power.  If you want an American car that is spacious, powerful, and luxurious, the all-new 2003 Mercury Marauder is the right car for you!
