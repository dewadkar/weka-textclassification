               Let me mention upfront that I don't own a Mondial T; but a '82 Mondial 8 coupe. As there was no specific catagory for the model I own, this one seemed most closely associated. I'm simply in hopes that possibly a comment or two regarding the basic chassis and powertrain as well as the handling, performance and operation of the car can be used by prospective buyers of the topic vehicle. 
   All Ferraris are, of course, thinly disguised racing cars. The Mondial is no exception, sharing all mechanical componentry with the 'GTB' models of the same year. The longer wheelbase Mondial (2+2 configuration) is better suited to the long and less 'directional change intense' &quot;corsa&quot;. The handling is beautifully neutral. The square tube 'spaceframe' provides an enormous amount of 'data' to the driver right up to the limit of adhesion. The chassis is designed for the grip of racing rubber at 'century and a half' speeds, so stock tires will never begin to phase it. The power train of these vehicles is sophisticated, strong and reliable as Ferraris have always been - but the modern V8's even more so. These cars in some parts of the country, rack up 150,000 miles and more before needing anything major. And depending on maintenance, can go even farther. The problem with any 'exotic' typically is, that an owner is sometimes behooved to keep miles from accruing for valuation reasons. They sit a lot; seals dry out and fuel tanks rust just as they would on your Toyota if driven once a year. Sometimes the consideration of a higher mileage car over a misused low mileage example can be well to your advantage. After all, many of these models can be had for under $50,000, so driving the car once a week isn't going to suck $200,000 off it's value.
   The operation of the vehicle is pure joy. The shifter will feel 'odd' through the first couple of gates, but that's part of the Ferrari aura. Eventually, you'll love it for that too. Seating position and relation of wheel to pedals to seat will feel new to you, but again... 
   A list of things to 'watch out for' can get more comprehensive even for some of the domestic 'drones' than this car, but a couple of things should be evaluated when shopping.
1. Belts - Make sure you see documentation on, at least, their most recent replacement. Timing belts are very critical, and if one breaks you're going to see about a $10,000 hole in your wallet. What to do? Don't let 'em break; change them every five years or 30,000 miles. Some dealers have different numbers for the frequency of belt changes, but get some numbers from a technician you trust. 
2. Timing belt idlers - I change these every time belts are changed. Cost is around $110 apiece (takes two), but again, cheap insurance. 
3. Check early cars for too much smoke. 'Too much' is hard to define, all Ferraris smoke a bit when initially lit, but if it continues beyond warm up it may be wise to look elsewhere, have the fuel-injection checked, (mine was set way too rich) or consider reducing your offer and contacting a mechanic. A few early cars got through will 'soft' rings and this can cost a few bucks -  however, if you can find a car at a good price with only this problem, throwing in an additional 5 or 6 'thou' for a ring job could be good move. 
   In conclusion, with the high-end sports car market still on the 'soft' side, ownership of one of these cars can be more than a dream for some people. Older model running cars can be had for as little as $25,000 - and be more than the most fun automobile you ever own; they are terrific investments that seem to appreciate well in an inflationary or bear market segment. Now if I can find a hacksaw, I'll let you know how the Cabriolet heightens the Mondial experience even further!
   Note: This is the authors first Ferrari, and one of his favorite. All work has been performed by himself and work done included the following: Timing belt and idler replacement -  Cost (parts only) $280. C/v joint boot replacement - cost (part only) $20. Car purchased a little over a year ago with 62,000 miles.
