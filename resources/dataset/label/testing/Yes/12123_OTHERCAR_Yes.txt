            When last you heard from Your Humble Narrator, he was giving four stars to the '93 626, a car which he found to be a worthy getter of groceries <i>and</i> a decent freeway flyer, two goals which are not always met in the same vehicle.  And in the fall, after getting an unexpected clean bill of health at 90k miles - a small but niggling electrical glitch took this opportunity to disappear - he noticed that the dealership was really trying awfully hard to get rid of the 2000 models before the 2001s showed up.

So here I am again, on my <i>second</i> 626.  It's the same old engine from 1993, a two-liter DOHC four, but it's been retuned for greater torque low down.  A couple of the things that bugged the last generation of 626 owners - noise from the valvetrain's hydraulic lash adjusters and occasional distributor failures - have been addressed by Mazda in dramatic fashion: starting with the '98s, the 626 has neither HLAs nor a distributor.  The newer car is slightly heavier, so the revised motor will get you from zero to sixty no faster, but having fewer things to go wrong must be reckoned a Good Thing.

The 2000 626 specifically benefits from some revised suspension tuning and improved steering; only the worst pavement upsets it, and while there's still a fair amount of body roll in turns, you really have to work hard to make it lose grip.  For a front-driver on indifferent OEM tires (mine has Bridgestone Turanzas), it handles remarkably well.  I'd like a little more feedback through the steering wheel, but other than that, the car's road behavior is exemplary.

As has been the case since '94, the four-cylinder cars get an automatic transmission sourced from Ford.  In its first few years, this box had a failure rate only a transmission rebuilder could love, but it's been revised a couple times since then, and in its current form it's a good match for this engine, shifting at just about the point you'd do it yourself, and with a minimum of back-and-forth hunting on grades.  By no means is this a speedy car, but it gets there with a minimum of drama.

The interior isn't much changed from my '93: there are fewer warning lights (and they're a lot less intrusive), the legendary SWING function on the center air-vent array has picked up some speed, and the cupholders are more functional and less embarrassing.  I miss the fresh-air override for the vents and the dashboard-mounted tweeters, but I suppose they had to do <i>something</i> to keep the price down.  

Who's going to buy these things?  Same people who bought the '93, I suppose: they wanted something crisply efficient (or efficiently crispy) and didn't want to have to find nine or ten identical cars in the parking lot at Target.  And Mazda still hasn't figured out how to sell this car, either.  The slogan they've used in Web banner ads (&quot;A dash of espresso in a decaf world&quot;) hasn't exactly set the world on fire, and, at least in its four-cylinder versions, the 626 is more &quot;zoom zoom&quot; than &quot;ZOOM ZOOM&quot;.  Still, it's a slick piece of work, and a blast to drive, and if you're one of those odd individuals who thinks his morning commute is actually too <i>short</i>, well, you probably already bought a 626.  Maybe two of them.
