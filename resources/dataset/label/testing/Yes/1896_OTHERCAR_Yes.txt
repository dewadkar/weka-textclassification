            I bought the CL18 as a replacement for my aging Casio QV-10 digicam.

I purchased it at Office Depot on sale for $60, plus it came with a $30 MIR from Agfa.  I figured I couldn't go wrong for the money.

Turns out, it has some great features and blows away the similarly-priced Agfa Smile in terms of value.  It's got a speedy USB connection (which actually POWERS the camera when connected to the PC...no need for a costly AC adapter!), decent e-mail or Web picture quality (640 X 480 resolution), a terrific bundled software package, a small adjustable tripod stand, and a soft carry case.

It doubles as a webcam using included Video Impressions software, and can record .avi streams with no problem.  For still shots, you can select the level of compression, &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; with the camera or variable 0 to 100 with the included Corel Photo House 5.  You can compress JPGs down to 50 or 60k with virtually no loss of quality, and zip them over even the slowest dialup connections without anyone moaning about the &quot;huge file attachments&quot; you sent them.

There is even an included video cable which allows you to display your images on any TV with an RCA video input.  This can really be fun but in this situation, the CL18 runs on batteries, so keep that in mind.

There's no LCD viewfinder, which is something film cameras never had either but, if you've had a digicam before with one, you will miss it.  The upside here is longer battery life, though.  

If you're looking for photo-realistic printed output, keep looking.  If you want an inexpensive but value-packed digicam for e-mail or Web use, that can do everything without you spending a nickel on accessories, then this is the camera for you.  If you can find one at Office Depot, even better!
