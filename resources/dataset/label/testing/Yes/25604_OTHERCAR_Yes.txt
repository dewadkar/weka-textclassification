            I have been driving Saab's new and totally redesigned 1999 9-3 for just over five months.  I previously drove a Saab 900S the precursor model to this car and have noticed the many differences and improvements made in the production of the 9-3.  This car is similar looking to the 900S but is a bit more sleek and sporty looking, especially the front grille with its trademark aviation look. It looks very good in any color you could possibly choose, and there is quite a variety of colors out there.  The interior is a quality leather with seats more comfortable than many other luxury cars out there, namely the BMW 5 series.  The dashboard is simple yet good looking and the car is quite spacious for a vehicle in its class. Enough about the inside though, what truly amazes me is this car's performance.  Outfitted with a HOT engine ( High Output Turbo) this car can dust off anybody.  There is no sign of turbo lag, as the car simply reacts instantly to any pressure applied to the gas pedal. The passing power in this car is incredible and it definitely comes in handy.  I don't think there is a lack of torque or power in any situation. The handling is superb and in my opinion, up there with that of more expensive cars.  Anyone who enjoys speed, five star safety, excellent handling, and a good value for their money should take a look at this car.
