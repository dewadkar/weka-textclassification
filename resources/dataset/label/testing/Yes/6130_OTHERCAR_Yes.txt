            About 8 months ago, when I started looking to buy a car, I established what features I wanted. After a short search, I narrowed my options to the Honda Accord and the Chevrolet Impala, ultimately choosing the Impala. Today, I proudly claim that I do not regret my decision in the least, and must recommend this car to others after 5 months of owning the LS edition. I have put 2,000 miles per month on the car, and believe that I know whereof I speak.

I also rent cars almost weekly, as I drive a great deal in-state for my job. Therefor, I have had the opportunity to drive most mid-size and standard size cars on the market, both foreign and domestic, in the less than 30k price range. The Impala handles like a smaller car, though it is easily the most spacious 2000 edition car I have driven or ridden in. As is visible from the outside, the Impala has an enormous, elevated trunk area. This lends to one of its few and minor shortcomings: having owned the car 5 months, I still have difficulty judging distances behind me when backing up because of the limited visibility. I previously drove a Ford Bronco II, and sincerely believe that the Impala has more available surface space. The LS edition is, to me, well worth the additional price, as having the LS ensures more luxury features (cd player, leather interior, sun roof, information center) as well as safety features (side air bag, 3.8 liter engine for when you need extra pep). 

I'm modest when it comes to the appearance of my auto, and would have preferred no spoiler. However, when purchasing the LS, one must pay extra to have this removed or special-order such a model from the factory. I purchased the Impala over the Accord very partially because of the outlandish popularity of the latter. However, since purchasing the Impala I seem to be unable to drive more than a few miles without seeing a car that looks like mine. I don't think that me and the others have been duped. In fact, most of the owners I see are guys in their late 40s to early 60s, who likely remember the glory days of the Impala. I consider myself wise beyond my 30 years to be driving this auto, and look forward to taking her to work tomorrow.<br><br>
