            I purchased my little Mirage brand new in 1997 and can proudly say that I still own my little baby. I can truly say that I've been very happy with it AND it's the only car that I've ever kept past three years and still plan on driving it for at least another five!

EXTERIOR: 10
Cute style-black is the best if you want to add some flare. The four door is handy for the small family or two door for the young people. Most cars bodies seem to be about the same on you're average car, and the Mirage fits in well with them. Truly, my favorite part of the car.

INTERIOR: 8
The interior of the Mirage is very comfortable with many options from CD player to cruise control. The seat belts even adjust to fit shorter passengers in the front seat. I must say though, that I did have more leg room in the back when I had my Protege, but still roomy enough but, I wouldn't put any long-legged people in the back seat.The air isn't that strong either-you have to put it on the highest speed if you want it to stay very cool in the summer.
ENGINE: 8
I've never had any problems with the engine-knock on wood. It's been very dependable. I've just had to change the breaks recently which has been the only repair. Just keep those oil changes regular!
HANDLING: 8
I would recommend that you replace the tires if they are the original. As stated in another review, they are slippery when wet more easily then other tires. I haven't had mine replace yet but plan on it. I think they did go cheap in this area.

RELIABILITY: 10
Very reliable car. Like I said, I've had no problems, just regular maintenance.
VALUE: 8 
I bought mine at the end of the season and got a great deal. I've recently had it appraised and was a little disappointed at the drop in value, but still think that it was well worth the money-it won't let you down!

THE VERDICT: AN EXCELLENT ALL-AROUNDER
I stand behind my Mirage and if you are looking for a dependable vehicle for yourself, your family, or someone who you'd like to do the sensible thing.
