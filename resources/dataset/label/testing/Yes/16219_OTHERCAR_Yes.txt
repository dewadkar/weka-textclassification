            I have been around Audis since 1980, and have formed many opinions on them.  I have personally owned two Audis, both Quattro�s (a 5000 Quattro, and a Coupe Quattro 20v).  Of both Audis I have owned, the Coupe is the more sophisticated of the two.  Why?  The Coupe has numerous features, such as heated front seats with 8-way power adjustments (driver side has a 4 position memory), power mirrors, power central locks, power windows and sunroof (with drivers express down, and a tilt/slide roof), automatic climate control, trip computer with many useful functions, real wood trim wrapping around the entire interior, and lots of leather.  The transmission makes the most out of the semi-low powered (for the weight of the car) high revving 20 valve engine, and is a joy to shift and use.  Clutch control is very good, and the stock brakes offer good feel.  In stock form, this is one of the best touring cars I have been in.  Since there is a low market for these wonderful but rare cars, the going price is low for what you get (new, this car was over $32k).  

One thing that is not readily apparent is the Coupe prowess on the race track.  Put on some high performance tires and brake pads and go out and have fun.  The illusion that there are not very many options when it does come time for tuning these cars quickly disappears when asking the right people (such as the 20v owners list at www.20v.org).  Several cars have been significantly upgraded with parts from other higher-performance Quattro�s and Porsches (engines, turbos, brakes).  Even with the power a few of these cars posses, they are still very drivable, and street friendly.

One drawback to the Coupe is that the mileage of most are over 100k, and even though the engine, Quattro system, and body are very solid, parts that Audi did not build start breaking down, like the AC systems.  These parts, due to the rareness, are expensive.  Other repairs, such as slave cylinders for the clutch are more of a pain than expensive for a German car.  Definitely consult other 20v and Audi owners before purchasing, and have a good, qualified, Audi mechanic go over the car.<br><br>
