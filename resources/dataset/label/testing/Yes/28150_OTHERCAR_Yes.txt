            I have owned the camera for six months and I DO love it.  It takes very good pictures and the software included is easy and comprehensive. The down side is it uses a set of batteries in about eighteen to twenty pictures.   Also the lens is offset from the viewfinder and allows user to stick finger in front of lens without operator knowing it.
Purchased at wal-mart for $195. Best buy.
this camera is for the first time digital user. <br><br>
