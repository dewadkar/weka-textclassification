            I highly recommend this vehicle for it's handling skill and ability to get up and go when needed.  Before my Stratus I had a Ford Taurus Wagon, which was good, but held nothing on my Dodge Stratus for the reasons I just stated.  Also, as compared to the Taurus Wagon, I have spent less time getting repairs to the Stratus which means I get to drive it more often that I had the Taurus at a comparable time frame.  The Stratus may not be a perfect vehicle since I recently receive a recall notice on a break fix that needs to be completed.  Once that fix has been completed and I know for a fact that Dodge cares about those driving on the open road, then my opinion will be even more glowing of their product (My New (Used) Stratus).  

Since I originally purchased this vehicle (March '99) as replacement for my Taurus Wagon, I have nothing but good thoughts of it.  It has taken me and my family on several out-of-state trips that I am sure my Wagon would not have been able to make, very comforting thought indeed.  So, If family safety and comfort is something your looking for in a vehicle which handles good and reliably, then the Dodge Stratus (four door) is the vehicle for you.
