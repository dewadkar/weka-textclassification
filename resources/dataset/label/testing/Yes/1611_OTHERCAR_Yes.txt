            When I bought my Chevrolet Prism, it wasn't the car of my choice.  I was young, and of course wanted a sports car.  My parents and wallet couldn't afford one, and that is how I ended up with my Prism.  I really have never had the opportunity to really appreciate it until I had my baby.

I love the 4 doors, which make it feel like a roomier car, but still compact.  I didn't want a large clunky car.  The car is very easy to drive.  I have a stick shift, and it handles great.  I get great gas mileage, and a great smooth ride.

The Prism has a very spacious trunk, large enough to fit a full sized stroller.  The spare tire and jack is an added plus feature too!  The inside cabin is quite comfortable.  Plenty of leg room for the front seat passenger, and still enough for someone in the back seat.  The seats recline to many different angles, supporting anyone!  Dual airbags, one for the driver and one for the passenger.  Child safety locks on both of the back doors, and the windows can only be rolled down half way.  The back seat also has lap and shoulder seat belts, that protect all of the body.

I have never had any problems with my Prism, and I have had it for 4 years.  The one thing that I don't like about mine, is that it takes a while to warm up in the mornings.

If you are looking for an inexpensive good 4 door sedan, the prism is the way to go!<br><br>
