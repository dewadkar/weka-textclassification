            I absolutely love my &quot;new&quot; (actually used) Mazda 626.  I have wanted one for years, and I finally got one.  Although it is the base model and has no power windows or locks, I still love it like a brother.  (And I don't fight with my car!)  

The ride is unbelievably smooth and the car handles extremely well.  I bought it two months ago with 60,000 miles, and it still has not given me the slightest trace of a problem.  The seats are large and comfortable, yet the car still seems small and sporty.  The stereo is also great.  (Of course, that might be because of the Kenwood CD player I had installed.) I also love the sleek lines and funny sounding horn that is in it.  I have always had domestic cars with those loud and obnoxious horns that could wake the dead.

The transmission does shift a tad heavy and there is some minor rattling at about 75 miles per hour, but other than that, my car is great.  I am looking forward to many more years of driving pleasure.

I recommend this vehicle to any driver at any age.  Its sporty and fun enough for a 16 year old to have a ball, and smooth and quiet enough for grandmother to enjoy her drive to the bingo game.  The Mazda 626 is a great car and I plan to always have one.  (Until I can afford a Lexus LX 470)<br><br>
