            I have owned a 325 for the past six years and am in love with it.  The car is big enough to meet virtually all of my needs, yet sporty and quick enough that you feel as if you are driving a true BMW.  So, why am in the market for a new car?  Well, for a couple of reasons.  For one, the deals are almost too good to pass up right now and they will not get any better in the future.  For two, my car is sort of at the make or break point when it comes to trade in value.  It has 90,000 miles on it and, for now, still has some trade in value.  Finally, I am at a stage in my life where the next car will likely be a SUV/wagon/mini van. 

Therefore, I decided to go to the trusty BMW dealer and take a test drive.  My fiance tried to get me into a 5 Series, but I am partial to the 3 Series at this point. We drove around the hilly and curvy roads and the highways of suburban Philly for close to an hour.  What a thrill.  We talked about some of the differences between this car and the one I own.  Finally, we discussed whether or not I should upgrade.

First of all, the specifics of the 2004 BMW 325.  I am not one to get very too technical, as I do not understand a lot of the technical jargon.  But I do know what works, makes sense, and what is not.

THE SPECIFICS:

*  All season traction control
*  Front, side, and head impact and restraint systems
*  Four wheel ABS brake system
*  16 inch alloy wheels
*  Top speed 128, 0-60MPH in 7.1 seconds
*  20 MPG city and 29 MPG highway
*  Heated power mirrors and windshield washer jets
*  Power seats with 8 or 12 adjustments  
*  Optional heated seats
*  Optional folding rear seats
*  Remote key entry with trunk release
*  One touch window operation
*  10 speaker AM/FM stereo and CD system
*  Daylight running lights

WHAT I LIKE:

1.  The 2004 BMW 325 drives like a dream.  I take good care of my car and have kept it tuned up and tight as can be, but wow, the 2004 is just another step up.  There are turns along the PA Turnpike where I will slow down from 80 MPH in my car and in the 2004 I can hardly feel the turn.  The tighter turns along the rolling suburban hills are even more fun.  The key thing is that when you make a turn like this, you do not shift in your seat and I never saw my fiance reaching for something to grab onto.  The 2004 handles like a dream.

2.  The 2004 is quick.  How it stacks up to the competition, I have no idea.  What I do know is that it blows away my 325.  The pickup is also very smooth and sudden (Automatic transmission is now my thing) and this is something that you do not always find with an automatic transmission. 

3.  The safety features.  Ok, I must admit that I do not know if I like the safety features, but I know that I like having them available.  My car has dual front airbags.  The 2004 has dual front airbags, side airbags, along with a head protection system.  To take things even further, there is an automatic cut off function for the gas line; if the airbags deploy, the gas is cut off.  Finally, a crash sensor will turn on the hazard lights and unlock the doors when a crash does occur.  Amazingly, this is all in addition to the ABS brakes.  Though you hope you never have to experience the safety features, it is nice to know they are there.

4.  The sound system is wonderful.  I am not one those who has to have the best sound system- most of the time I listen to talk radio- yet this stock sound system is impressive.  The eight speakers provide a rich sound that resonates throughout the car.  You can upgrade to 12 speakers and a better sound system.  Either way, you will enjoy a great system.

5.  The looks.  The 2004 BMW 325 has a similar look to what it has had for the better part of a decade.  I consider this a good thing.  The car is sporty, but not too sporty.  I do not feel like I showing off when I pull up in front of clients, yet I can pull up to the wealthiest of people and not feel as if I am driving an inferior automobile.  

6.  Options galore.  Ok, so you want options and add on's?  You got them:  Heated seats, power doors, power windows, power sun/moon roof, 12 speaker stereo, xenon headlights, retractable headlight washers, split fold down rear seats, myrtle wood finish, cruise control, dimming rear view mirror,  rain sensing wiper blades, and an on board navigation computer.  

Do you want all of these?  Probably not.  However, the heated seats are a joy and wonderful on your back.  The power options are a must for a car that costs this amount of money.  The cruise control is a must if you drive highways.  Alas, the rest of the extras are probably not needed.  The key is that they are available.

7.  BMW service.  I am one who always wonders about service departments.  You take the car in for an oil change and find out that you have two cracked belts a need a new pair of brakes.  Before ya know it, you are out $595 for what was supposed to be an oil change. Ouch.

However, the thing I like is that each time you car is due for an oil service, the technicians will check out the car.  I have had a few things found during oil services that were lucky to be found when they were.  Additionally, you are dealing with true professionals versus who knows who at the local garage.

8.  Ease of use.  I know that most of know how to get into a car and get it running.  What I mean is that the 2004 is easy to use from the perspective that you have one touch windows, keyless entry with trunk release, and controls that have placed in intelligent locations.  You will not find yourself searching for a stereo control or the cruise control knobs.  Most all of the controls are located on the steering wheel.  Very convenient, but also something that will take you a little time to get accustomed to.

9.  The craftmanship.  The 2004 is quiet.  The doors close with the thump that you like to hear.  The seats are comfortable enough to live in.  The leather is beautiful.  The myrtle wood trim (optional) is tasteful.  The electronics work quickly and efficiently.  The 2004 is a very well built automobile.

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE:

1.  The trunk is tiny.  I thought the trunk was small with my car, but this one seems to be even smaller.  In other words, do not expect to fit three golf bags in the back of this car.  You cannot do it because the trunk is not wide enough at the top or in the back near the seats.  

2.  The doors are not very wide.  One problem I run into is that you cannot get tall  or wide things (A TV or a chair)into the 325.  Again the reason is that the doors do not open wide enough.  The front doors are ok, but the back doors just do not provide that flexibility.

3.  Brake dust.  I have no idea why BMW's seem to produce so much more brake dust, but they do.  Either that or the dust just sticks to the rims more so than with other cars.  Regardless, the sight of always dirty looking wheels is annoying.

4.  The area to my back and left seems to be a much larger blind spot than what I am accustomed to with my car.  I had a difficult time finding the cars that were immediately off my rear quarter panel.  I am sure that you get accustomed to this, but it was alarming initially.

THE BOTTOM LINE:

The 2004 BMW 325 is a wonderful car to drive.  The car provides a great ride from a handling and acceleration standpoint.  The looks are classy BMW standard.  The options are plentiful and, for the most part, useful.  I am a huge fan of the 2004 BMW 325 because you feel like you are driving a car that costs a lot more than $30,000.

So, did I purchase it?  Not yet.  I probably will, but I want to run the figures another time or too to see if we can comfortably afford to add a few hundred dollars to a monthly budget that has already grown significantly and will shortly involve a honeymoon and wedding.  At the very least, I am going to do what I can to get us in the 2004 model within a year.
