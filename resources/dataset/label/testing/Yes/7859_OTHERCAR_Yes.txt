            All right, I have been looking for a sporty, high performance vehicle ever since I joined up with the computer industry. Always wanted one and the computer field is paying well these days.

BMW instantly stood out as the obvious choice, having an excellent reputation for turning out high performance sporty vehicles. A trip to the BMW Ultimate Driving Event (a really cool autocross) moved me to visit the dealership shortly thereafter to test drive the new 330Ci.

So, here are some key points about the car (took delivery today) and my experience with it so far. The options include the Premium and Sport packages, Xenon headlights, Harmon Kardon audio and the Navigation system.

Performance: This is the main reason I thought about this model.
   1. Excellent acceleration and passing capability. Looks to make the   
      daily commute much more fun.
   2. Brakes are equally as robust, adding a sense of safety to the car.

Appearance:
   1. I really like the chassis design for the current 3 Series. I also  
      like smaller cars, so this is &quot;just the right size&quot;. Steel gray was 
      the color of choice with a Gray leather interior.
   2. The interior feels cozy and also &quot;just right&quot;. That being said, if 
      you expect to invite several tall friends along for the ride, this  
      probably isn't the ideal car for you. 
   3. I especially like the aluminum trim near the doors (can't think of 
      the term, much better than standard paint job (which scratches 
      easily.
Options: This actually is also the biggest con about the car in terms of adding to the price.
   1. Premium package - Offers the leather, moon roof and power seats I   
      wanted.
   2. Sport package - This was actually a reasonably priced option and 
      adds performance tires and a more aggressively tuned suspension. The
      overall effect for me is awesome handling.
   3. Xenon lights - I've seen these on other BMWs and have always had a
      gripe about standard lights, so this also was an easy decision for 
      me.
   4. Harmon Kardon - I really like to listen to music while I drive,  
      especially my CD mixes and wanted the upgraded audio to enjoy it. 
      This also was one of the more reasonably priced options. Also 
      purchased the trunk mounted CD changer (not reasonably priced. If  
      you don't mind a bit of do-it-yourself, the OEM part can be had for 
      about $470 or so, much less than $795 installed).
   5. Navigation  - I like gadgets and get lost easily. The price is steep
      but I figured that it would be worth it in the long run.
   6. Steptronic transmission - I live in an area where the traffic is 
      really congested and a manual just isn't an option. No gripes about
      the performance though, leave it in &quot;Sport&quot; mode.

Well, that's a quick rundown of the vehicle itself. BMW also adds free maintenance for 3/36,000 which is rather nice, but is really reflected in the price.

Speaking of which - BMW consistently brags to its shareholders that it maintains one of the highest margins of any automaker. So, while I agree that the company puts out a great product, I do object to the fact that the company charges such a high premium. Still, you generally get what you pay for and I expect lots of fun from owning this car and few problems. 

In terms of a recommendation; Yes! If you are looking for a car like this and aren't put off by the price.
Also looked at MB CLK, Lexus SC300 and Audi S4.

500 mile update:
Hello again, figured I would add a bit more info-

The car is extremely good. Great acceleration, handling and braking. I drove my old car recently and the difference is shocking. The BMW is so much better. I hadn't realized how good it is at first. The Xenon lights are truly fantastic and make night driving much better. Also, the sound system is pretty good, although not great. I don't listen to music with a very heavy bass component or at very loud volumes, so the system isn't being overly stressed.

A few less than positive points:
The wheels are high maintenance in terms of cleaning, the amount of brake dust on the rims is significant. In fact, just one day of driving in a moderate fashion yields blackened rims at the end of the day.

Also the gas consumption is a bit high, around 19-21 MPG in mostly highway driving. However, I have read many posts that the mileage improves as the engine breaks in.

Still give a strong buy.<br><br>
