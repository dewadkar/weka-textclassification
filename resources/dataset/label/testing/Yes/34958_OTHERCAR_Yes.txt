            Six years ago I was in the market for an affordable, comfortable, reliable and sporty looking car. I bought a Pontiac Grand Prix. Now five years later I wanted to update my vehicle and knew right away that I wanted another Pontiac Grand Prix. I am now the proud owner of a 2000 Grand Prix. And  again Pontiac has met my expectations. I have a 6 cylinder, 3.8 engine and it gives me top performance. Passing other vehicles is a breeze with the power it has. Gas mileage is good too for a car of its size. I average 31 miles a gallon on a trip. The widetrack offers a lot of room which makes driving and riding very comfortable. It can accommodate 5 passengers very comfortably. Some of the conveniences I enjoy on it are the cd player and the headlights that turn themselves on and off automatically by a sensor. This means I never have to worry about leaving my headlights on and coming back to a car with a dead battery. I love that feature! Electric windows, doors and entry are some of the other great things about it. I also like a car that is sporty looking and my Grand Prix is all of that with its bucket seats and automatic transmission on the floor. But even more so than that, it just has a sporty look to it the way its designed. I've had many compliments on it. I haven't had any mechanical problems with it, nor do I expect to. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a car that is dependable, comfortable, affordable, and sporty looking and  yet has room for five. Pontiac, you did a great job!! Keep up the good work!
