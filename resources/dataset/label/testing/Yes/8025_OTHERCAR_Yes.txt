            We purchased this camera about a year ago, not knowing what to look for in a digital camera, and just took a chance.

This is really the best camera I have ever had.  I know there are others with alot more features, but this one is so much fun, and easy to use.  You just put in the batteries, slide in a disk, and open the screen!  Viola' you're ready to take pictures.

It uses more batteries when I use the flash, but I feel like I get good life out of them.  When I'm outdoors, and not using the flash, the batteries last and last.

The zoom is easy to use, and you never have to move your fingers, it's all just located in a comfortable place.  The screen is easy to see just what you're looking at, though it can wash out a bit in bright weather.

The quality of the pictures is really great!  I have had many of them printed, and they are better than my last 35mm camera.  I also just had an insurance claim, and instead of prints, I sent a disk with the pictures on it.  The insurance man was very impressed at the quality and clearness of the pictures, and said that this was the first time he had recieved them in this manner, and liked it alot better that regular prints.

I have had such good luck with this little camera, and have taken hundreds of pictures without any problems, I highly recommend it to those who just want a fun easy camera, with great quality shots.<br><br>
