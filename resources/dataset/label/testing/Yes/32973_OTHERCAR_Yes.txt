            OK, I've read some negative reviews and I will base mine on them.

First off, with the exception of one review I did not see anybody say that his or her car would not start, or left them stranded.  If you read the reviews carefully, you will see the majority of complaints are with the STEALERSHIPS.  I don't want to seem uncaring or rude, but when will people learn that dealerships RIP YOU OFF?!?  Sure there are honest dealerships, but that is rare.  Unless you have a warranty, you have no reason to use one.  They charge twice as much for labor and (the stories never cease to amaze me) blatantly LIE about work that needs to be done.  I guess people like the fact that they are in an air-conditioned building talking to a guy with a tie on.  Toyota is no different than any other dealer.

This car is a dream come true.  The only thing I do on it is regular maintenance since I bought it with 32k miles.  If you read your owner manual, it will say that under extreme conditions that your oil should be changed sooner than the recommended intervals.  I change mine every two thousand miles.  I change my transmission fluid/filter every ten thousand.  I have almost 100k miles and not one leak anywhere on this car.  It burns no oil and shifts flawlessly.  Not bad for a car that is almost seven years old. 

It handles ok, and it looks ok.  I did not buy the car for cornering or looks however. 

The suspension on this car is a bummer.  With my wife and two kids going over a speed bump can yield a loud scrapping sound.  The front strut mount went out around 50k miles.  I bought the part but still haven't gotten around to replacing it yet.  It rattles but that is about it.  I just read that the six cylinder models had stiffer suspension.  This is good news for me and I will replace mine all with the 6 cylinder model.

The drivers side door lock is having problems.  So is the trunk lock.  However, I can still open it with the latch.  The electric door locks all work fine still.  The electric windows work fine and so does the sunroof. The cruise works fine and I've never had a problem with that either. AC works great and kept us cool in LV and South Rim Grand Canyon.

The plastic things break easily on this car over time.  The mirror on the sun visor.  The cupholder in the back broke. 

For me I do not base reliability on plastic parts that commonly go bad on Japanese cars.  Being realistic, you will see that they all do this.  I do not base reliability on my experiences with the dealership.  I base my reliability on the fact that this car always starts and goes anywhere without a problem.  Brakes wear out, egr valves need to be replaced, etc etc.  It is part of owning a car.  If you get ripped off that does not in anyway represent how well the car is made. 

I take this car everywhere: Long trips, mountain driving and every day commuter.  I feel more comfortable taking it on long trips than my Mercedes.  THAT IS how reliable it has been for me.  Take care of these cars and they will go well over 200k miles.  I plan to have the original transmission and no major engine work (other than timing belt replacement) at 200k.  I may not have any locks that are working and various plastic parts broken and in my glovebox, but I'm sure the car will still be going.

Approach this car build realistically, stay away from dealerships, change the oil often, and this car will be more than worth your money.
