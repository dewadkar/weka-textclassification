            The 9-3 is the third SAAB I have had the good fortune to drive.  The first was an older 99, it belonged to a friend of mine and I had the use of it for 1 year.  It was wonderful.  Next i had a 900, it was great. It drove like a dream, the company stood behind the car.  Unfortunately i had some mechanical problems with the car(lack of dealer prep), but SAAB of America took care of everything. 

The new 9-3 is wonderful.  It gets good gas mileage, handles like a dream and is sexy as He*l.  Now for the bad part.

This car is expensive to own. If you have never owned a luxury vehicle before, get ready for financial overload.  If you thought sticker shock ended when you signed the loan papers, you were wrong.  At 30,000 miles, a little light comes on on the dash and it is time for the first service.  The service costs roughly $1,000.  And no one tells you this when you go to the dealer.  They just expect you to give them money.  And for $1000, what do they do? They fill some fluids and check things out. You dont even get a new set of brakes.  This continues every other year for as long as you own the car.  The transmission is weak.  The clutch is strong and will last a long time.  The seat construction is poor, comfortable but poor.  If you are a tiny person it probably wont be a problem, but if you are a good size they will not last.  Insurance is high for this car.  But you can be happy in your SAAB experience.  Find a good independent mechanic.  Other owners will tell you if they have one. Go to this person and stay with them. <br><br>
