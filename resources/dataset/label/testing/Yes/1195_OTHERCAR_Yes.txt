            We bought a Dodge Neon 2000 in May of this year.  I love it.  I went from a 2 door Escort to the 4 door Neon and being a mother of 2 small kids I don't have to tell you the convenience this gives me.  It is a compact car with a lot of room.  I can park just about anywhere and not have a problem of not fitting but the new design gives me the room inside that I need.  

A friend of mine has a 98 Neon and the improvements that they have made are wonderful.  The front forward cab gives me a lot of room as well as the complete door frames.  She was having problems with the windows in her car because of the missing frame.  Good improvement.

I moved from Maine to Texas shortly after I bought it and I never had a problem with it.  My boys and I had plenty of room to move even after I had packed the car with everything that I needed for the trip.  

One more final point to make is that I have had problems with my credit in the past and I thank Chrysler for giving us the chance to move up into the kind of car we needed for our family.<br><br>
