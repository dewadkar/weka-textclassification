            Background
Well, I just got back from Georgia.  I took a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am with the 3.4 V-6 with 170 HP from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Savannah, Georgia.  I was able to drive over 2,000 miles with the car in a week.

Pros
The number one factor that made the Grand Am special in my book was its ability to achieve close to a 30 mpg during the trip.  Driving in the city reduced the mileage, but on the highway it was spectacular.  I was amazed at the smooth, precise, and agile steering that the Grand Am had to offer.  There was no problems reaching highway speeds, nor was there any problem passing on the Georgia freeways in speeds in excess of 70 miles an hour.  I am not an advocate of speeding, but it was pleasurable to be able to push the limits of this automobile on open stretches of road.  This car was able to easily handle speeds on the far reach of its speedometer.  The car was comfortable for my friend and I with little if any cramping or back discomfort originating from the seats.  It was nice not having to take a prolonged stop on the way to stretch and work the cramps out.  

Cons
I would not suggest this car for more than 2 or 3 people on a long trip.  There would be a considerable amount of cramping involved for the backseat passengers if the car was full.  I was also surprised at the slight struggle that the Grand Am faced in parts of Tennessee and northern Georgia in the higher elevations.  There were moments where I would have my foot on the gas pedal and not the car would not increase in speed.  It was disappointing but in no way did it detract from my overall enjoyment of the car.  

Overall
I would recommend this car for any road trip no matter how far the destination was.  There was adequate trunk space and it was a pleasure to drive.  The car will offer the ability to test your lead foot and have a little fun, but it also gives the opportunity to get great gas mileage.  With gas prices quite high, this is an economical way to get to your vacation spot or become your everyday driver.
