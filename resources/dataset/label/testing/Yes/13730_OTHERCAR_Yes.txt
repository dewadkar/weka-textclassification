            When I first started selling Nissans, the first vehicle I looked at was the Murano.  They had just stepped out into the public&#146s eyes, and yet I hadn&#146t seen one out on the road yet.  I was shocked since I work and live in the Valley of Money and More Money.  It is one of those vehicles that when once you see it, you will not be able to take your eyes off of it, like the new 350Z.  I will never forget when I went driving around for about an hour or two with it to see how it handles and get the feel for it when I pulled up to any light for a stop, the Murano was gawked at.  Other SUV lovers surrounding me, which they are a dime a dozen out here in Scottsdale, Arizona, were in a trance with the exterior.  And that was just the exterior, can you imagine if they had seen the interior?  Well here is what I found while selling this vehicle:

The price of the Murano has gone down since it originally hit the floor.  Why?  Well when you initially introduce a vehicle that is new, especially something like the Murano or the 350Z, you have the ability to price it up a bit.  These vehicles suddenly become in high demand, not only because they are incredible not only to look at but also to drive, but rather that everyone always wants the newest thing.  Out here in Scottsdale, the Muranos are finally being seen left and right around town.  It is always what is trendy in this neighborhood of the country, which isn&#146t bad, if I could afford I would buy it too.  As much as I love the Altima, if I had a little more cash and a family to boot, the Murano would be my next choice.  Okay back to the pricing, from what I have seen in last week&#146s Sunday paper, they were marked down to about $26K on Sale, somehow I can&#146t see that price as possible though unless it comes with nothing addition on it.  Less than six months ago, most of the sticker pricing on the vehicles out on the lot were from $33K-$39K, but many of them were fully loaded.  I think about now with the way the economy is you could probably get close to invoice on them which is around $25K-$26K, depending on the model, even with option if you know how to negotiate well.  Nissan&#146s MSRP is about $30K.  

<b>THE OVER VIEW</b>:
When Nissan was designing the Murano they were basing it on the mid 40s driver that would mostly be married men with an income around $80K and would have children that hadn&#146t hit the double digits yet.  The Murano is a luxurious SUV expected for mostly in city traveling.  It was built on the same Altima platform that I love so much (see Nissan Altima from the Former Saleswoman&#146s Point of View), so it doesn&#146t have that rough and bumpy SUV feel to it.  The Murano is about comfort and ease.  It is the first designed engine with the CVT (continuously variable transmission) in the United States.  The CVT allows this vehicle to be even more unique which I will further explain later. It is a five passenger vehicle, but is most comfortable with four passengers.  There are also two trim levels at the SL and SE.  It is a vehicle that has a dramatic appeal to it that will as I said make people take notice of you.  The primary competitors out there against the Murano are the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, and The new Volkswagon SUV, but as far as I am concerned, this is the top in its class.  Now let&#146s get to the stats:

<b>ENGINE</b>:
The Murano has a 3.5 liter 24 valve V6 engine with about 245 horsepower at 5800 rpm, which is standard on both models.  As with the Altima, the engine was made with aluminum components which reduces engine noise and gives a better fuel economy.    For better coolant control, there is a timing chain driven, not belt, water pump.  Nissan finds that with the timing chains (also on the camshafts as well) the engine lasts much longer with out tune ups until you hit the 105K mark.  Oil temperature is controlled by a liquid cooled cooler maintaining consistency.  As in the Altima there is also the ECCS mode (electronic concentrated control system) which allows in emergencies for you to get to a safe place without blowing your engine.  Nissan, even though it has mostly produced many vehicles concentrated towards the male population, also makes the engine easy to look at and find things.  The yellow tops are usually what I would be worried about, like oil, and water.  It allows me not to make a silly mistake of pouring the wrong liquid in to say the water container.  As also in the Altima, the Murano sits on the same liquid filled engine mount which to you means that the engine is going to absorb most of the vibrations allowing for a more quiet and smooth ride.  A quick little side note:  I don&#146t know why but I can&#146t tell you how many times I have pulled into my mother&#146s driveway and she has left her car door open.  Now I don&#146t know why she does that (could be a habit now) but it is on occasion drained her battery and I have had to jump start her car.  So Nissan kept this in mind in all their vehicles and developed a battery saver timing device, where after about 30 minutes the interior lights automatically just turn off.

<b>DRIVETRAIN</b>:
Remember that CVT (continuously variable transmission) that I mentioned earlier?  Well when I first drove the Murano I was shocked because it really does work.  After never hearing of such a thing, I didn&#146t think this was possible but it allows you to never feel the engine shift its&#146 gears.  From 0-60, it is a smooth acceleration and let&#146s not forget the pep with the 245 horsepower.  For all intents and purposes, the vehicle has one gear and it is important to you because it will cut down on your fuel economy and allow for a quieter engine.  Each model of the Murano also has the option of the VDC (vehicle dynamic control) which is traction control essentially.  If you were to take a quick turn or need to avoid an accident situation, the VDC will apply the brakes as necessary in order not to roll the vehicle around corners or have a slippery situation in those icy conditions.  The Murano is a front wheel drive vehicle but you also have the option of having all wheel drive on either model as well.

<b>SUSPENSION</b>:
Keeping in mind that the Murano was built on the same platform of the Altima, the suspension is also the same.  The front suspension has a strut design that uses fewer parts and reduces the weight improving the performance and durability of the SUV. The front wheels act separately and will react on their own while in the rear suspension the wheels and chassis are helping smooth out the ride.  Nissan loves to use those light weight components helping to improve the performance of the Murano and all their other vehicles.  As in every vehicle, there are stabilizer bars that help the vehicle maneuver out of sticky situations.  The only model that comes with a sport tuned suspension is the SE model.  The sport tuned suspension may help with a quicker response in handling the Murano but I do not see it as a necessary option when I compared the difference.  It is standard on both models for variable assist power rack and pinion steering which means to you that whether in low or high speeds the Murano is going to respond well.

<b>BRAKES</b>:
Standard on both models is the 4 wheel ABS (anti-lock braking system) and power assisted 4-wheel vented disc brakes.  There is less driver effort when having to stop the vehicle suddenly and the ABS helps out in those slick conditions to retain direction control of your Murano.

<b>WHEELS/TIRES</b>:
Okay the wheels can get a little complicated so I am going to list this little table to help you:

18 x 7.5 5 spoke wheel		Standard on SL
18 x 7.5 6 spoke wheel		Standard on SE
18 x 7.5 5 spoke chrome finish	Option on only the SL model

Both models have all season radial tires so you can still go from Scottsdale to Flagstaff without a worry.  For you ladies out there that are like me and can change a tire but sometimes find it difficult to lift it out, well Nissan thought of us and made a spare light and compact located underneath the trunk/cargo area in the back.  

The Murano just as every Nissan has been built using the Intelligent Body Assembly System (IBAS).  As I said previously try this:  Walk up to the Murano with a piece of paper and measure out the space between say the door and the panel.  Well that little tight measurement will match up anywhere else on the vehicle.  Those robots aren&#146t hard at work for nothing.  In order to reduce any corrosion or rust on your vehicle there is a Body undercoating and compared to other competitors Nissan applies it to more of the underbody.  So basically it isn&#146t half-a$$ done.  

<b>EXTERIOR</b>:
Okay we talked about the exterior and how dramatic it is compared to any vehicle in its class.  Well the aerodynamics are advanced as well on the Murano to once again help you out with less wind resistance for better fuel economy.  It is standard that both models come with a dark chrome grills in front, chrome door handles, and body color bumpers. On the SL model you may option up with charcoal lower bumpers and it is also optional, yet standard on the SE model to have silver lower bumpers.  The headlights are halogen and come with that famous polycarbonate crack resistant cover.  Yes, you can still punch these headlights too and they won&#146t crack or break.  It is standard on both models for fog lights, a rear spoiler and power outside mirrors with tinted glass.  We need that tint out here in the land of the desert.  On the rear doors and back window there is privacy glass to give you more intimacy (maybe at the drive in or something along those lines) and also to filter out that hot darn sun in the desert.  You can option up for a sunroof and add on a luggage rack as well.  Nissan prides itself on the cross linking paint job that they put on all their vehicles to save you from those light unexpected scratches that people sometimes may do by accident getting in or out of the car.  

<b>INTERIOR</b>:
I love my bucket seats as you know and yes they come with the front bucket seats.  These seats on both models with power adjust in 8 ways, also gives you some lumbar support for your back, and if you want you can option up for heated seats (not a really popular option here in the valley of the sun).  Say you and your spouse share this vehicle well there is also the option to get a memory card on your seating as well so you don&#146t have to mess around to find the exact way you like it every time the other one takes the car out.  There are the standard seatbelt adjusters (I hate when the seatbelt ends up across my breast rather than between them), the 60/40 split back seats will fully flatten down for extra cargo room.  The steering wheel is leather wrapped and you may add on leather to the interior or keep it simple with cloth interior.  With the cost of leather and if you are trying to budget a bit, skip it on the SL model.  Nissan charges an arm and a leg for the leather upgrade in this vehicle adn many of their others.  For the short people out there (me I barely hit the 5 ft mark) there is an option to get adjustable pedals and yes they have their own memory card too for you and your spouse.  It is standard for remote keyless entry, power windows, door locks, cruise control on steering wheel, interior lights with dual map lights and reading light in the back and sun visors with those handy extensions I love.  Well those extensions come in handy out here when you are sitting in bumper to bumper traffic on the I10 and the sun is blaring at the side of you.  It gets that area out of your eyes.  There is a Home Link Universal Transceiver that is also standard where you can control your garage from the car or your security gate.  I live in an apartment so I don&#146t have to worry about that but it is nice to have if for someday I get a house.  Yeah and as I said with the Altima the famous valet key lockout.  You head out to one of the five casinos that I mentioned in a previous article in Phoenix and valet park as you hop from one casino to the next, well now that valet guy can&#146t get into your glove compartment.  Now as far as the switches and controls, they are a drawback, especially for a short armed woman like myself.  They aren&#146t easy to get to although Nissan says that they positioned them for the driver, I think they screwed up and thought we were driving in Europe and made them up for the passenger.  They aren&#146t comfortable to find until you get used to what you need to get at.  If you are an on the go person with cell phones and all the other devices out there that I don&#146t know about, there are 3 volt outlets for your plug ins: the lower dash area, the back of the cargo area, and in your middle console to hide that cell phone.  The back of the vehicle is easy with the lightweight liftgate (I call them trunk lids but Nissan prepares you for all the correct language but you know what I am talking about).  After you lift that thing up and you have to thrown in a lot of stuff, well there are two hand releases on each side of the cargo area that Whoosh!, the seat backs in the rear are flat down.  No more getting in the side door and pulling a button and pushing down, just the Whoosh! In order to provide a quieter ride for you there is insulation in the carpeting and panels standard on both models.  It comes standard as well with its own Vehicle Security System so the Murano will honk and flash if someone tries to start it without the right key or steal the cylinders.  
Now there is this option that I know jumps up your cost, but I just love it, The Nissan Navigation System.  If you have a spouse like mine that refuses to stop to ask for directions (which I know there are plenty of you out there), here is where it comes in handy.  It is the best concept I think that Nissan has come up with as far as interior features so far!

<b>SAFETY</b>:
Well you have the seatbelts (just kidding), the air bags standard in front on both sides, and roof mounted air bags as well for side impacts.  So if you run that light and someone else runs into you at the t-bone, you will still be okay.  There are child safety door locks and the LATCH System (I can't say I know much about the tether and anchor bit but I know that Nissan always focuses in on the Safety first).  You have your usual accordion with the front and rear crumple zones that I had to make everyone touch so they knew what those indents were.  There is also a latch that prevents the hood from coming through your dash as well as the engine ending up in your lap.  The engine will automatically drop and slide under should an accident be that severe.  The side steel guard beams, just as on the Altima, run diagonal from shoulder to foot area.  None of this vertical crap which many companies do because they think the ribs are the only important part to preserve in you.  

<b>AUDIO</b>:
Standard is the AM/FM/CD but you can option up on either model for the Bose System 6 disc changer system.  Standard is 100 watt and 6 speakers, and Bose package offers 225 watt and 7 speakers with a subwoofer and steering wheel controls and that speed sensitive thing as you cruise down the road.  I still don't understand why so many men love that feature.  The radio already comes satellite ready in both models.  I can&#146t believe this because when I saw it, I thought what is this world coming to, but there is also the Nissan Mobile Entertainment System.  It consists of the console flipping up as a screen, a dvd player with wireless remote and wireless headset.  I am sorry but as my mother drove me across the country with my brothers in her datsun all we had was the look out window feature and trying to get the truckers to honk their loud horns.  Oh how times have changed and I actually sold two of these entertainment packages as well.  

<b>PACKAGES</b>:
Premium Package &#150 option only on SL
SL Leather Package &#150 option only SL but requires Premium Package and a Sunroof (oops forgot to mention that leather is automatic on SE model)
SE Popular Package &#150 Option only on SE
Cold Package &#150 Option on both with SL requiring the above leather requirements and on the SE you need the SE Popular Package.
Dynamic Control Package &#150 Option on both models with same requirements above

I would get into the packages but there are detailed and you should just keep in mind to see the actual list of what comes with what before making your educated decision.  It is easy to get talked into things when you hear one feature that you like but don&#146t realize you don&#146t need the other five. So look them over closely.

<b>THE DRIVE</b>:
The Xtronic CVT allows for a smooth acceleration whether in an urban setting or getting on the highway.  The Murano handles very well whether in AWD or just front wheel drive.  The steering is responsive but not overly sensitive.  Compared to the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander there is a much quicker response and less effort on your part as well.  When sweeping through off a ramp on the highway or going down the windy roads in San Francisco, the Murano remains balanced with each curve.  The Murano responds well at either the high or low speeds as I have previously mentioned.  If you were to brake suddenly, the Murano will stop effortlessly and remain level, non of this jerking forward stuff.  If you were to opt for the Dynamic Control Package, make sure during your test drive you take the Murano in quick tight circles again and again to see how well the tires grip to the road.   The Vehicle Dynamic Control Package, which I do recommend in snowy conditions, can help you if you oversteer and understeer as well.  As for the areas that stay away from the icy conditions in the winter, the all season radial tires will do their part just fine.  

<b>SUM UP</b>:
The Murano is a LUXURIOUS SUV.  It is not made for off roading or rugged terrain.  It is designed for comfort, with the exception of the interior controls.  The outside appearance will catch everyone&#146s eye if you like that sort of attention.  It can fit 5 passengers but as I said four is much more comfy.  There are many little special features like the cargo releases for the back seats that make this vehicle unique.  The choice of a CVT engine is different, yet refreshing.  You can drive around town getting about 20 mpg in either AWD or 2WD, and about 25 with both models as well.  It isn&#146t that much of a gas guzzler, believe me I have seen worse.  If I had to compare it with the Pilot or the Highlander, I would say take the Murano.  It may be a few extra bucks for features here and there but it is well worth it.  You will definitely get your money&#146s worth.

Always remember this, we are heading into the 2004 models now, go out and get that 2003 while time is left.  The dealer has to pay 5% of the sticker every day to Nissan as long as that vehicle is on their lot.  They want those 2003s to move on, believe me.  Go in the middle of the week, evening time.  Negotiate and keep in mind the invoice price.  Also keep in mind about that $1K to $2K that is hidden from the consumer so they still have room to move even if it is below the invoice.  

Have a fun drive out there and enjoy all the attention!

Until the next Nissan review,
