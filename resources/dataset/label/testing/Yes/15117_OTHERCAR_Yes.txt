            When it comes to Nissan's, I feel like their part of the family.  I now own my second Nissan Altima. I put 45,000 miles on my 1998, so I recently bought a 1999.  The car is a true work horse.  The engine provides a wonderful amount of power for the money.  I do recommend the 5 speed transmission, as my in-laws and two friends have the automatic, and it is not even like driving the same car.  Theirs is sluggish, while mine drives like a 4 door sports car.  So much so, my mother in law asks to drive it when she is hear.

Perhaps the best part about the car is the equipment it comes with.  I bought mine with the CD player, 100 watt sound system, AC, the works, for less than $17k, brand new.  I still can't believe the deal.  

This car is a pleasure to drive, you'll love it.  I compare it to the 300 series Mercedes I have had, a 325is BMW I drove for several months, and my old Corvette, and I still love this car better. (Only slightly better than my convertible Corvette, but that was in college.)
