            I have NEVER seen a bad deal on a Pontiac Bonneville.  When I was eleven, my parents purchased a new 1992 Bonneville.  I was so excited.  Never before had I ridden in a car that drove so smoothly.  It was so unbelievable, as though I was riding on air, barely touching the road.
The Pontiac Bonneville comes fully loaded at a cheap (in comparison to many other Luxury vehicles) 23,000.  Every penny is worth it.  My parents first Bonneville went nearly four years without any problems, other than regular oil changes and other scheduled maintinance.  In fact, the only problems that that car ever did see were things like worn out tires and a few scratches to the bumper, thanks to a new sixteen year old driver.
I would recommend this car to ANYONE.  It drives wonderfully, it's loaded with everything you could ever imagine (minus the big screen television and the kitchen sink, of course), and for years of comfortable driving, 23,000 is a small price to pay.
