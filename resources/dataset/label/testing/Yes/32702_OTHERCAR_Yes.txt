            I wanted to have a sporty, yet comfortable car. One that comes with lots of options, that ordinarily cost extra on other cars. For the money, I couldn't find anything else that included all the gizmos. The interior is very roomy and lord! you could fit an elephant in that trunk! Which is another reason I liked it. I needed plenty of room for suitcases, golf clubs, etc. It's quiet, it's got tons of zip- great for those Interstate merges! Go with the upgraded stereo- it's worth it! My gas mileage has been around 21mpg. The best feature is the rear view mirror, night vision thing. (Don't know what it's officially called) but I'd love to kiss the engineer who thought of that! No more bright headlights in your rearview mirror at night, the mirror reflects a green color and drastically dims those headlights behind you.
This was my first Chrysler product and I was a little worried about their reputation. So far, my 300M has been good, not perfect, but who's car is? I've had some dealership problems and some creaking in the front suspension. If I had to do it all over again...I'd buy another 300M. Who cares if it's not a BMW or a Saab? I'm not coughing up $30k for a foriegn car with a 4cyl engine, cloth seats, and a manual trans., where every little tiny items is &quot;extra&quot;.<br><br>
