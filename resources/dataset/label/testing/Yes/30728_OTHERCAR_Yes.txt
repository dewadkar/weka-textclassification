            I bought my Achieve used, from a local dealer. I got a great price on it, and I just love this car.

Beacuse I bought it used (it was only 1 year old when I got it), I got a good price, and I got all the bells and whilstles.  My car has:  Anitlock brakes, Daytime running lights (I NEVER have to turn my lights on, because at night, they adjust- along with the dash lights- to be brighter), power everything, and even more.  I also have traction control for those slippery rainy or wintery days.  I have no regrets about this car, it has been very good to me, and I really do trust the oldsmobile name.  

I plan on getting a newer car in the next few years, but since they stopped making the Achieva, it looks like I will have to look at either the aroura or the intrigue.  Both are very nice.

If you are in the market for a used car, and you come across an achieva, really consider it before you move on.  This car has been great to me, and I love it!<br><br>
