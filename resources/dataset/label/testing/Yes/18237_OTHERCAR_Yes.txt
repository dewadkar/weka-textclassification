            To my very little children, this is our &quot;race car.&quot;  Compared with our huge SUV, this is a very sporty car indeed--though I do not think it compares with a race car in very many significant ways.  The 850 engine is a bit sluggish, which is no doubt why Turbo versions of this car were also offered (we bought it new).  However, since we have not demanded that the car do any James-Bond style racing, we have not regretted saving our money and bypassing the Turbo upgrade.
We've had the car (it is actually a wagon) now for 3-4 years and have never had it in the shop for repair--just basic maintenance.  We had one bad experience with the dealer seriously scratching the paint job during routine maintenance and not taking responsibility for it.  Further aggravation along these lines we have avoided by avoiding that particular dealer.
Overall, it is a very reliable car with a real luxurious feel (the leather seats with heaters are great).  The traction control is a big plus, but no substitute for a real four-wheel drive vehicle (while driving in the snow with the kids I much prefer our SUV for this reason).  Volvo's safety record is unparalleled--and I think this reason alone is a good reason to buy this car.  <br><br>
