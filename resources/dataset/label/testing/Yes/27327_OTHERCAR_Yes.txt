            Sleek, Stylish, Powerful.  These are some of the words that can describe the Dodge Durango, but underneath the body lies something that most SUV's don't have.  The Durango has a wider wheel base than that of most SUV's on the road today.  The wider wheel base has a lot to do with the turn-over or flip-over of a the vehicle.  The Durango in my opinion has more chance of staying on the road better than that of any other sports utility out on the market because of the wider stance that the Durango has.  The Durango can be used as a Family vehicle, or it can be used for a rugged work vehicle, just depending on what you want to use it for.  I havn't seen any major problems with this vehicle since it was introduced to the Dodge line up.  Overall I would say that the Dodge Durango is the best built and best buy out on the market.<br><br>
