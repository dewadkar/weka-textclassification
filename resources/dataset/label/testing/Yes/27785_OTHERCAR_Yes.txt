            This is my review for this great little digital camera....

My first digital camera was a Toshiba Pdr4 which broke 3 times in 9 months, the dial on it is a defect in the design in my opinion. So I got QVC to trade it in for a Canon S100 Digital Elph! I wish I had bought this 1st. I wasted 9 months with a camera that doesn't come close the the quality, easy, features of this camera!

Upon first view of the ELPH I though WOW it's like a James Bond device, it looks like a spy camera. I noticed how solid the thing was!, it had very little plastic, which meant it was high in quality design. But how did it take pictures? and how easy is it?

This camera takes incredible pictures, if you want to view some photos goto my website http://www.dog-park.com and click on the photo gallery and check out the November 2000 pics and compaire them to the previous months Toshiba pictures and you will see a major difference. Note also that I took the photos in lowest quality and had to reduce the quality even more so that the page would load faster. I would be happy to email anyone who requests a non cropped image.... Ok on with the review... The Menu is easy to navigate and has many features, brighness, picture quality, landscape, up close photos, and tons more... Now onto the Battery life.... Blows the Toshiba Pdr4 away, I took about 300 Photos with the viewfinder off most of the time and it still had some power. The camera comes with a rechargable battery and a charger, it does not come with an ac adaptor, you really dont need one! the power lasts really long and the battery charges up in about 2 hours unlike The Toshiba Pdr4 which takes 8 hours...

The only bad thing about this camera is that it is so interesting looking you will become a celebrity, everyone will come up to you and ask about it. It's amazing!

Final Thought.... If you want an easy, fun, great, middle price ranged quality digital camera this camera is for you, it is awesome!<br><br>
