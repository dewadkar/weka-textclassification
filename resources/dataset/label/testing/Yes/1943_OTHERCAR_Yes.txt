            I recently bought a 2000 Maxima GLE (all options) with 9,500 miles...at what I think was a hell of a steal of $20,600.  First off, I was looking at more "upscale" cars like the BMW 330, Acura TL/CL or maybe a new Volvo or Audi...but at 30K plus I was going to have to lease the car to keep my checkbook happy.  Then I thought what about buying a slightly used luxury/sports sedan???  That made more sense and the Maxima fit the bill.

The good:  I love the interior of this car.  I have the tan leather and it just gives an open feeling and with the smooth contour of the dash it is just pretty.  Hard to find a better looking car from the inside.  I do favor the tan leather look to the available black and grey...to each their own.  The Maxima GLE has enough luxury perks to keep most happy like great leather seating, 8 way power seats w/lumbar adjustment,  built in antenna in back window, (2001 has stereo controls on the steering wheel), heated seats (like I need those in Miami), good looking wood trim unlike some cars that look awful...and saving the best for last...the Bose stereo.  Wow!  The 200 watt, 6 speaker + subwoofer is terrific.  I usually have to upgrade the sound system of my cars but not on this one.  I even thought that I would add an amp and give the sub more clean power...but it just wasn't needed.  It gives a great smooth, bass filling sound that is just fine as is.  Do yourself a favor and no matter what model Maxima you get upgrade to the Bose system with the subwoofer

Next up the engine and ride.  The 222 hp V6 is a wonderful engine that gives power at many different rpm.  Whether you need get up and go from the line or passing speed she can give it to you.  The car likes to go.  And because the ride is so smooth and comfortable you better keep and eye on the speedometer or set the cruise control or else you could find your self with flashing lights in the rearview mirror.  I find myself going over 90 way too often...and get this my mother in-law (the in-laws drove the car down to Miami from NY for me) she has a lead foot and said when old slow poke went to sleep she got it up to 125mph.  I would say it is a great cross country cruiser.  The GLE rides smooth but can still take a turn and give you feel on the highway, but if you want more of that tight sports car feel you would have to look at the SE.  

The bad:  Well, I guess I would put it this way...I still have car envy of say a BMW 330, Acura CL-S/TL-S or a nice Audi, Lexus and Volvo.  But I should, and in turn they should be saying why did I spend 10-20K more for a similar ride, comfort and performance.  Goes both ways.  Other negative would be that the car is big and heavy.  No way around it.  The flip side is you have a lot of room and a substantial feel to the car but that is not always a good thing.  This is a bigger and heavier Maxima then in year's past and thus the car is not light on it's feet.  Which in turn leads me to the last negative which is the car can make you feel like you are in your "parent's car" ie. generic, nice, smooth but no frills.  That's the case until you crank up the stereo and punch the gas a little.  Then you are sent back to your sports-luxury sedan Nissan Maxima. 

The ugly:  As for appearance...I like the looks of the new Maxima.  Some do not.  Oh well their loss.  I think the look is much improved over the last generation Maxima and of course above the ordinary Camary, Accord, Tarus...on par with the Acura TL, I30, Saab, but not as flashy or pretty as the new Volvo, Audi, Lexus or BMW.

Change:  Of course the Maxima could be improved.  I would like to see it a little lighter or crank that V-6 up to the reported 260hp for next year.  The car could use a sport-shift for the automatic, memory for seat/mirrors and "On-Star" or navigation system as an option.  Close but not perfect.   

What it comes down to like most car decisions is price, performance, prestige and value.  Your choice is spend the money and get a Volvo, Audi, Lexus, BMW...or put that in your stock portfolio, bank, college fund etc and look at getting the Nissan Maxima GLE or SE.

*  I can only recommend the GLE or SE with the leather interior as the GXE and cloth seats make this car look well dull and ordinary.  Plus the Bose 200 watt stereo is a must if you opt for the SE (it's standard on the GLE).  If you can find a great condition, low-miles 2000 SE or GLE that is the way to go IMO, but I would also recommend the 2001  under 26K.
