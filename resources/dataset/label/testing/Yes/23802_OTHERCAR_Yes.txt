            This opinion is based on 2 weeks of ownership and 1500 miles.

The first impression is that this is a very small car. But once you sit in it you realize that there is an amazing amount of room inside. I&#146m 6'4" and had no problem getting comfortable behind the steering wheel. The seats are quite comfortable, especially in the front. Four average people fit inside with no problems (as long as they don&#146t play in the NBA) and there is plenty of room in the trunk for their luggage. You have to see it to believe it!

The fact that the instrument is in the center of the dash does not bother me at all. It is unusual but you will get used to it pretty soon. 

The engine is very strong, the transmission shifts smoothly. Even with 3 persons on board there is enough power available to merge in to traffic. Don&#146t worry; the engine needs to be revved to extract all of its power. 

The brakes are excellent. Considering the weight of the car they had an easy task. My car has no anti locking brakes but is easy to control. Mileage is around 41 MPG with the automatic (60% highway, 40% city). If you want a new car with even better mileage, buy a diesel instead and spend at least US$ 5000 or 6000 more. The ride is actually quite good in the city and even for the highway. If it&#146s windy, you certainly will notice it! Parking is a breeze, the car fits into space my present truck would never fit.

The air-conditioning works well and the Radio/CD player I have is excellent.

UPDATE (July 04, 2003)

Today the 65000 mile mark was reached. No repairs at all, still the original Michelin tires and brake pads (only 40% worn).

I installed an Amsoil dual filter system (see www.amsoil.com) at a mileage of 30k miles and have been using synthetic oil only, changed every 18k miles approximately. I use oil analysis to determine the right oil change interval. My driving is mostly on highways and for that reason the car is very easy on the oil, brakes, tires, etc.

The average gasoline consumption is almost exactly 42 MPG. Pretty impressive, huh?

I'm having an engine block heater installed before next winter and mileage surely will improve a little during the winter months.

As you can see, I am very pleased with this little critter, mileage and reliability are outstanding and I expect keep it for many more years.


Condition: Almost new (1500 miles).
Model year: 2001
Reliability: Zero problems.
Quality and craftsmanship: Excellent
