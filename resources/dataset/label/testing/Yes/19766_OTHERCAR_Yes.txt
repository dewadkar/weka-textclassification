            This is truly a car for your money.  I am very impressed with the Mazda line of cars. This car maker is truly under estimated.  The Mazda 626 gives you everything you could want in a sedan and more.  Very comfortable and roomy and not to mention stylish.  I have a burgundy sedan and my model when it is clean it is sometimes mistaken for a Lexus, most people do have to look twice.  Mazda offers different assessory option all of which I took, everything from day time running lights to the sunroof to the spoiler kit.  The most impressive part of this sedan is the swing vents.  Do yourself a favor, if you are in market for a sedan between $15,000 and $20,000 take a test drive of the Mazda 626 lx model.  You won't be disappointed.  The car drives great, has bumper to bumper warranty and is stylish.<br><br>
