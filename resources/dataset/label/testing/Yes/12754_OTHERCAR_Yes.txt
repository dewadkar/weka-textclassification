            Most epinions focus on just the good points, well i'm going to be different and tell you everything bad.

This is a great camera and i highly recommend it though.

2.3 megapixels is fine, and you can get some really quality pics from it.
The bad points:
well, firstly its only 8MB.
someone said on another epinion that this was more than enough, I disagree.
on the best quality, you can hold only 7 pictures. and on the worst setting 140. but with poor quality. cards are not cheap either, but Smartmedia cards (as oppose to compact flash)are definately the way to go.
The most annoying thing is the speed. it takes forever to save a picture on the best quality setting, which is only really ba problem if you want to view the picture straight away.
The flash has to charge before you can take ANY picture wether you are going to use it or not, so if you see something you want to snap, you can turn it on in 1 second and by the time the flash has charged the picture may not be worth taking any more. It has happened.
The other problem is letting other people take pics. They don't know how to focus it (you hold the button down half way) and you have to teach them, also a few times the dial has turned top the manual mode where you get to preview the pic first, and for others I have found that they just keep taking pictures without saving them and then they end up with none at all.

Well, thats about all the bad things, apart from the lack of a USB port. You really do need it as the serial cable takes around 15 mins to download the whole 8 MB as oppose to about a minute if you had USB. You could buy a USB card reader as an extra though.

1 more note that will probably not affect anyone, but, i bought a flash path adapter, that is an A drive disc with a slot for the smartmedia card. Great idea but if you use an external A drive (mine is a USB one) then it won't work.<br><br>
