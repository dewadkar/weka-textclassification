                   This is the best car that I have owned by far! We bought this car back in 1996. For only 40,000 miles it was the best buy for us at the time. We have put over 100,000 miles on the car. It is a comfortable ride on short or long trips. The gas mileage, 30mpg, is great The electrical system has been in poor condition since the before the purchase of this car. From flashing check oil and gauge lights to frequent headlamp bulbs burn out. The only major repairs the car has had is the timing belt, alternator, and just recently the dual muffler/exhaust system. With these being the only real major problems I would buy another achieva. <br><br>
