               The BMW E36 3 series does it all. Never has there been a car so equally capable of jaunt to the local supermarket or a spirited chase through various back roads (not that I'm saying that you should break the  speed laws of this fine nation, but...). The engine is torquey and powerful, with a wonderful exhaust note. The only problem with the 2.5L inline-6 motor is that it's powerband does not really start to kick in till about 2500 rpm, not that this is a problem. BMWs beg to be driven, and driven hard. The 325 is not exception. Drive hard. 

   The suspension and chassis are more than up to the task of harnessing all of the engine's abilities. Turn the wheel and the 3 series will go where you point it. Push the brakes hard and your eyeballs will strain to stay in your head.  The 3 series' handling is has no equal in its class. This is what car companies try to sell as active safety. The 3 series is will get you out of danger/trouble if it rears its ugly head. Not only is the car capable of accident avoidance, but it responds well to the hand of a knowing driver. Like I said, this car begs to be pushed hard. 

   That's the marvel of the 3 series. It does so many things so well. Hauling kids to soccer practice is a comfortable experience in the sedan, cruising down A1A in the convertible version is grand, and styling while flying down the highway in my personal favorite version, the coupe, are all done with equal grace. The only problem for many of these tasks is rear leg room if you're carrying passengers. Kids will be no problem, but for long drives the rear seat of even the sedan could be a little small for all but the most wee of adults. The interior is stylish, but definitely comfortable. Nearly anyone would be comfortable in the great front seats. All the instruments and various controls are within easy reach of the driver, absolutely great ergonomics.

   For the serious wrench or racer this car is awesome. It responds incredibly well to upgrades. Making the 3 series go faster, handle tighter, or stop better is just a question of how thick you wallet is. The BMW 3 series does it all, whether you're a grocery-getter looking for nice, sporty ride or a racer looking for a winning car.
