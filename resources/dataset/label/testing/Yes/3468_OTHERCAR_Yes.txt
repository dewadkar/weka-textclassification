            I just got rid of my 98 Buick Century and got a black 2000 Bonneville SSei.  This car is by far the best looking car out there.  A friend of mine just bought the same car and I couldn't take my mind of it, so I had to get one of my own.  Even beside the Grand Prix (which I also like) it just looks so much bigger and stronger.  I love this car!  Every time I get in or out of this car, I stop and just take a moment to admire the sporty design.  There isn't any car out there that looks better!
The 240hp 3.8L supercharged V6 engine is the closest you'll come to a V8.  It is power packed and has incredible pickup of the line and even better between 80 and 140km/h.  I've personally only had it up to 160km/h and it wasn't anywhere near slowing it's climb!  The only down fall is the craving for supreme gas.  It can add up if you drive really hard, or are showing this car off.
Personally, the interior could use a couple of adjustments.  The head rests are not very useful and I've never been a huge fan of Pontiacs' red backlighting, but it works in this car.  Other than that, this car is something to be proud of.  The leather heated seats are great, especially  for life in Canada! And the 12-disc CD changer is great for long trips.  And the sunroof is a dream come true.  It's near luxury and near sports car.  I'm impressed with GM on this one!  And the great thing is that there aren't many of them on the road, which cannot be said for the Grand Am or the Grand Prix.  
Inside and out, this care takes the cake and I would recommend it to anyone who could afford one!
