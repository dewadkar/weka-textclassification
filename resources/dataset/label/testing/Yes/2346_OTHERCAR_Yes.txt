            The PDR-M4
This camera provides the look and feel of a 35mm snapshot camera. It has a fast power up and a burst photo mode for action shots the USB downloading is quick and almost automatic. While the plastic case looks fragile I have discovered it is very rugged and has a no slip finish. Control and set up are simple and the Image Expert software while not as featured as Photoshop LE is very good, and it has an audio feature that is very unique.
I would highly recommend the PDR-M4
