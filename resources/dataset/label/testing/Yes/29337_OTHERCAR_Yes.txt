            The Corvette has been a head-turning influence on the road for many years.  From the old Classic Corvettes to the present ones, each Corvette catches not only the eye of the car-admirer's but of many of those who could care less about cars' looks or performance.  As an owner of a C-4 convertible, I have enjoyed driving this 300-horsepower muscle machine for two years and going.  I bought this vehicle because it is fun to drive, fun to watch, and simply fun to talk about, and not to mention extremely reliable.  I have had no problems with this car, not even minor ones, and I have noticed that there is somewhat of an unwritten code of fraternity between owners of Corvettes on the road.  Often do Corvette owners passing by wave to me, no matter what the year of the Corvette.  The only problem that I have had with my Corvette is the absence of back seats.  The good points, however, greatly overwhelm this drawback.  The Bose sound system that is standard in Corvettes is truly enjoyable, and the sound is clear and precise if you wish for soothing music.  If you wish for bass-pounding sound, it has that as well.  Driving this vehicle is a definite plus.  The intense power can be restrained or enjoyed, depending on the mood of the owner.  It is a true sports car; all advantages inherent in sports cars such as responsive steering and brakes are pronounced boldly by the Corvette.  If you are looking for a car that can become almost part of you where the thrill of driving never decreases, the Corvette should definitely be a prospect.  If you are looking for a family car, however, please go buy a &quot;more practical&quot; car like a minivan.<br><br>
