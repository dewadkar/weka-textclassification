            My experience is in the hobby/enthusiast area. This is mainly a camera for my wife to use, but it has become the main camera in our family. My 35 mm camera and my very expensive Olympus C2500L are backups now. The C-4040 is the very best for recording our life as it happens. You just set it to P and shoot. The fast 1.8 aperture seems to be the crutch for making many more good pictures than bad. The resolution I use puts about 160 pictures on a 128 megabyte card and prints acceptable 8x10 glossies, even if you crop 40% out of the print. Everyone comments how this camera takes so much better pictures than their digital cameras. I attribute that to the 4.1 mega-pixels and the fast lens. It just puts more information into each file, and in digital photography, the volume of information seems to be the important factor, after you get past the lens, and I always trust Olympus to put good lenses on their cameras. With good quality editing software, red-eye is no problem either.  The camera is near two years old now, and the retail prices are so much better, but this camera has been replaced by the C-5050. It was retailing at the time for $1099, when I found my deal... $627 including shipping. I didn't need any cards or odds and ends, because I already had an Olympus digicam. Using the lithium single use batteries gives you from 4-6 months of photography fun. I just love not having to think about batteries, whenever I take my camera out. I do put a set of AA alkaline batteries in the bag, and leave them, just in case... but have never used them.
