            I purchased a Used White Lexus LS 400 at an auction 5 years ago. 
It is the best car I have ever owned. (My previous car was 
Audio 4000) It is so comfortable and easy to drive. It 
holds the road very well even at high speeds. So far I have 
not had any major repair costs and the car now has 80,000 
miles on it. It is a luxury car that is affordable and gets 
great gas mileage on long trips. One of the
best things is that there is no engine noise inside 
the vehicle. After 5 years it still looks like a new car.<br><br>
