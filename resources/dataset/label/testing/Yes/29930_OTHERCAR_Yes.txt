            I was discussing my new car with another owner who mentioned that it looked like a big tennis shoe and it does!
Actually the body style is one of the most beautiful I have seen on any SUV.

RIDE:  One of the smoothest I have experienced in SUV's

COMFORT:  It's best feature.  Very comfortable on road trips and off road. Air conditioning extremely effective in our 110 degree plus weather. Rear A/C not as powerful as Chevrolet Tahoe, but sufficient for any needs.

FIT and FINISH: Generally outstanding sort of like Toyota is better than Nissan in my opinion.  A few glitches like the dash display for miles left to drive got off, the auto antenna quit working and one of the auto door locks went on the blink.

SOUND SYSTEM: Outstanding in dash choice of combo cassette/CD OR stackable CD

EXTERIOR:  I believe this car is one of the most stylist and beautiful cars on the road.  Plastic flashing needs some better dent resistance.

INTERIOR: When I first sat in the car, I felt the leather seats where too upright and rigid, but found this actually be a good feature and very comfortable for long trips. Rear accessory plug well placed.  Great family car with car seat custom clips.  Well thought out design including storage. Two glove compartments quite a nice feature.

ENGINE:  I would like to see a V8.  Slightly sluggish on acceleration, but fine at top speeds.

HANDLING: Slight "boat" feel with a little sway, but overall comfortable.  Feels a lot like the Lexus SUV which I test drove before buying this.

VALUE:  Really, the price is just a little too high.  I personally was willing to pay the price, however, for the solid feel and nice extra features.

NEGATIVES??  
Price is a real issue, otherwise I love it!
