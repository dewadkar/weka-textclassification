            As the owner of a 1999 Grand Am SE, I have mostly good things to say. 
We purchased this car in August of 1998 and have taken many road trips. 
The ride is great and I think the seats are comfortable. The engine a 150 HP I-4 has good acceleration for a 4 cylinder. The stock stereo is good but we chose to upgrade. We have had a few problems with the brakes(nothing major). I absolutely love the styling of the car. It stands out for sure. We chose not to go with the alloy rims and opted for wheel covers ( big mistake) 
The hubcaps are really loud and have had to be tightened down several times.  The back seat is roomy, a big plus for those with children. My son's car seat fits great and has been really easy getting him on and out of the car.This car has good leg room (I am Tall)  I would recommend this car to any of my friends. I also plan on being a Pontiac owner for a long time.  Oh yeah I also recommend it in Silvermist.<br><br>
