            We have had this 2000 Concorde for 6 months and thoroughly enjoy it.  The interior is extremely roomy and luxurious.  It handles well and accelerates powerfully.  The trunk is very large and has a netting insert for small or breakable items.  The insert can be removed easily. Another feature I like is the adjustable seat--I can recline and nap easily on longer trips. We have found it to get approx. 22 mpg. This car gives you the feeling of riding in a luxury model but the price was equal to many cars that didn't measure up at all.  
My partner especially enjoys the fact that people admire the car wherever we go. The styling is very classy looking for a reasonably priced car.  We have had many compliments from complete strangers!
