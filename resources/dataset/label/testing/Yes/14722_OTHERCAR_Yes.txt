            I currently drive a 1988 convertible RX-7, which I purchased from the second owner some six months ago with 120,000 miles on the odometer. That is a lot of miles, I will admit, but this car is a real beauty. Black over black exterior with a gray and black upholstery and seats out of an 89 GTU, she looks magnificent. I was smitten instantly. Looking over the cosmetics, I realized I had some sun damage to replace, typical with the little 'verts. Upon taking up the challenge, I discovered how rare and coveted parts are for this vehicle. The convertible is NOT a hard top RX-7 sans top- it is a completely different vehicle altogether. Much heavier than the rigid-roof counterpart and flexier in the frame to boot, you won't see too many of these in the racing circuit. But that's just fine with me. This car was made for turning heads, not quick lap times. 
   I am often asked "what kind of car is that?" by fellow roadgoers at stoplights, gas stations, and other gathering places. The blacked out badges on the trunk make it hard to discern from any distance. The guesses range anywhere from a Toyota Supra (they do look similar to the untrained eye)to a Mercedes. I will have to say that most modern cars have nothing on the looks of this child of the late eighties. 
   The convertible top itself is a marvel of engineering, combining the quiet of a hardtop with the open air of a convertible. The forward section is rigid, and can be removed completely, like a "targa" top. The rear section has a glass window (with a defroster!) and is powered to go up or down with the twist of a knob on the side of the instrument surround. The glass and hard targa combine to kill a lot of the road noise customary to most ragtops. Three ways to look great on the road- top up, targa, or full open air. With the top in fresh-air mode, there is little buffeting in the cabin thanks to an ingenious little wind blocker built into the rear cargo cover which folds down when not in use. Under that cargo cover lies a cool little aluminum mag spare wheel, tool kit, and aluminum jack. These were measures taken by Mazda to lighten the load a little on the heavy 'vert- along with an aluminum hood up front.
   The convertible also comes stock with a killer stereo system by Pioneer with slick little speakers in the headrests of the seats with separate volume controls on the center console. Very advanced for 1988. Push a button, and you get simulated surround sound. Great for when you have the top down and don't want to blare the radio.
    Mechanically, these cars are known to be quirky, but there are a host of websites and chats devoted solely to these little rotary engines, which have developed almost a cult following. You can get info on common problems and how to fix them, i.e. the "short start" problem rotaries encounter, the blinking dash clock, and windshield wiper switch failure, among others. 
  Suffice it to say that these cars are not for everyone- you must possess a drive to tinker with things and an uncommon lust for these cars- be an aficionado of sorts. But when you drive one, be prepared to gets lots of looks- she ain't no wallflower, folks. As many fans of the rotor motor say, "to love one is to drive one".-  Tk2
