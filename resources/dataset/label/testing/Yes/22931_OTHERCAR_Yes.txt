            I realize that the title might sound a bit stiff, but the '95s are your last chance to get a Jeep Wrangler that hasn't been completely "Chryslerized".  While I am a big fan of the '97+ suspension and grill styling, the newer interior modifications are what make me a real fan of the square headlight era.

Things to love about the pre-'97 Wranglers:  A gauge/dash package that wasn't stolen from a Dodge Caravan.  The lack of any airbags whatsoever.  A great deal more driver and passenger room.  The ability to modify and repair anything at any time with a standard set of tools.  The pure love of being one of the few to go anywhere, anytime, be it snowstorm, mudslide, or mountainside.

Sure, you can get a 97+, and enjoy a full coil suspension and a quieter ride.  While I respect the notion that these items and much more contribute to added safety, I'm not sure I want it.  I don't drive an SUV like a madman, I respect its capabilities and its limits, and I operate the vehicle accordingly.  What a novel concept.
