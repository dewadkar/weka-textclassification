            Subaru Forester - Model L - 1999
    I started researching for a replacement vehicle 
in September of 1998, I included searching the dealers
and internet for answers and specs, and test drove my
list, compared notes with prices and finally bought
the vehicle of choice.
   The Forester was the choice I made - and here's why;
First, I wanted a vehicle that could (if needed) take 
me safely to my destination with a solid body around 
the passenger seating.
Next, I looked for fuel economy and seating options, the
Forester has both. The drivers seat has adjustable lumbar
support and the back seats also recline. I'm told they
are nice - I'm in the front seat. The fuel economy is
really good - I took mine 3000 miles in 2 weeks in Sept.
1999,I averaged 28mpg, I was in every weather climate I will ever run
into, the vehicle handled great and I felt in control
every mile. I might mention that I've chased storms for
20 years and know about weather. The Forester passes my
tests and is a great vehicle to own.
