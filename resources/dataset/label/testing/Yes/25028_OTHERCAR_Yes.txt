                 I have this van and there are more things about the van that i like than dislikes. I have ten grandkids and number eleven on his way, all but three live close to me. Well being disabled and most of the kids wors differant hours and several not able to drive I'm always hauling some one to work, school, or just to a friends house.
     I also like going to yard sales and always bring home things I don't need. We also go about fifty miles one way to do our monthy shopping and there is always someone that wants to go with. It seems like I'm always hauling something with it.
     I find that the van is very easy on gas in the city as well as on the interstate. We drive alot of miles in a year and never worry about it breaking down. This is the third one I'v owned now and I will buy another one soon. When I first got mine first van you did see some around but today every where you look you see at least one everytime you turn around.
     The only dislike I have is when the driver seat is all the foreward  there is not room for your legs. <br><br>
