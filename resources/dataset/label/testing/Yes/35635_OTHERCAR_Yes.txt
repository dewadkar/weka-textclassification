            Some time ago, I had the misfortune of being on the receiving end of a collision while waiting at an intersection for the light to turn green. Needless to say, the car I was driving at the time was considered a total loss by the insurance company so I had to search for a new set of wheels. What I was hoping to find was a vehicle that met a variety of needs - performance, good gas mileage, some comfort and basically dependability. After cruising through the auction houses for quite some time I came upon a car that seemed to fit the bill - the Chevy Beretta GTZ. I know what you're thinking - Beretta?, those cars are wimpy! And you're right, the regular Berettas are. But what I didn't know at first was that they made a &quot;beefed up&quot; model, the GTZ with the Quad 4 engine.   

Let's start with the performance. The car comes standard with 180 hp 5 speed with a gross weight of under 3000 lbs. Basically, this car is pretty damn good off the line with it's high torque. The Quad 4 is the same engine design that is used in Indy 500 cars. In my own experience, on the highway it is very easy to max out the odometer at 120 mph. The redline for RPM's is 7000 and while cruising at 120 mph the tachometer was at 4500 RPM so there was definitely room to push it even further, but I ran out of highway at the time. With the right set of tires, this cars also hugs the curbs with a good stiff suspension. So, I've been happy in this category.

Gas mileage has always been good with it topping off around 31 miles per gallon on the highway. This is the benefit of having a 4 cylinder engine. I usually spend about $15 per week on gas and the commute to work is 20 miles each way so I've been pleased in this category also.

The comfort is surprisingly good in some areas as well. The car comes with power windows and power locks, cruise control, air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, Indy style bucket seats with lumbar control and a decent stereo system. However, the ride itself is typical Chevy &quot;sports&quot; car - you feel every bump in the road. But other than that, it's not too bad in this category.   

Dependability is pretty good too. Other than some minor repairs such as a regular brake job and engine mount replacement ($25) the car hasn't needed anything major and it now has a little over 103K miles.

All in all, it's not a bad car and it has some nice looking standard ground effects with a rear spoiler and the rear seats fold down for extra trunk space so it has some utility function as well. Unfortunately, they stopped making them with the Quad 4 engine in 1995, I think, and replaced it with a wimpy 140 HP 6 cylinder engine but the body style has remained the same up until the last year where they stopped making them in 1996. I wouldn't take this car over a traditional &quot;muscle&quot; car (Mustang GT, Corvette, etc.) but it can hold it's own, especially when you consider it's relative purchase price. And what I do like is that they are somewhat rare to find on the road today because they just didn't make too many of them and people always ask me what model car it is after I zipped pass them on the highway 10 miles ago. Anyway, until my Corvette is finished (yes, it is still at my brother's shop waiting to be painted) it suits me just fine as my &quot;main machine&quot;.
