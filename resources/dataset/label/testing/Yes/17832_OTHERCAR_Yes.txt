            This car is worth every penny! Its outside styling is very attractive. I have the  V6 GLX model so it is completely loaded with every feature I could ever want. It has plenty of power and gets right with it when you need to pass or enter the freeway. It makes steep grades seem flat. When cornering at fairly high speeds it goes right where you point it and you don't feel it pulling against the steering wheel. One day someone pulled in front of me and I had to hit the brakes hard and was able to steer around them while breaking and didn't lose control. That is awesome. Its the perfect size sedan with a big trunk. The A/C even works in the trunk! For hot days when you have groceries in the trunk. This car has 8 air bags! Doesn't get any better than that!  The engine is smooth and quiet, shifts smooth when using tiptronic.  I like the fact that the transmission adjusts to how you are driving. When driving somewhat aggressively it shifts at 5500rpm instead of 2500rpm. All controls easy to use and very well designed. The seats are comfortable but still feel sporty, have good support. It is very quiet in the interior. Sunroof has a setting where its not quite open all the way, this is where VW says to set it for the least amount of noise and wind. I haven't driven farther than four hours yet, but at that amount of time I'm still comfortable.How is the back seat? Back seat has plenty of leg room and head room. Fits two adults comfortably. You could put three if you had to, but what sedan fits three comfortably? Land yachts! Fits three children in the back ok though. For a V6 it gets decent gas mileage. I get about 19 in town, and 25 on the freeway. I generally go 75 to 80 on the freeway, so it would probably do better if you drove more economically. I have loved cars my whole life, my father was a race car driver. So I am not reviewing the car lightly, go drive one to see what I'm talking about!
