            I had to put a piece of my down a year in advance to hold a car for me, since production was so limited.  In the midst of it, the recall announcement came.  I was worried.

My Audi TT was made 01/00, and delivered 03/00.  I picked it up early 04/00.  I've had it 2 days.  

I LOVE IT.  It hugs the road.  It has this deep note to the muffler like it's an aftermarket add on.  The pickup is great.

Mine is a denim blue with ebony leather.  Not too many people are taking that colour, but I do know that people have given me a lot of positive comments in the past two days, and I PERSONALLY LOVE THE CAR.  

My girl is currently going through emotional stress since it's rare that a car can compete on that level, but here's the baby.  I recommend it.<br><br>
