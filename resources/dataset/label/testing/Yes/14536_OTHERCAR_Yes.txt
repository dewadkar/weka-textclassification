The Protege is now closing in on 149,000 miles. In its tenth year the car has been...trouble free!

ORIGINAL REVIEW
We have owned our 1991 Mazda Protege since it was new. This car even predates our marriage. The car is approaching 137,000 ultra-reliable miles. In the nine years we have driven the Protege, it has never once stranded either of us. The worst problem we�ve had is when the water pump went out last fall. Even so, I was able to drive it to the Mazda dealer to get it repaired. I use this car to commute 50+ miles every weekday, and we plan to keep the car until it dies, hopefully many years from now.

In 1991 my then-girlfriend purchased the Protege at Covington Pike Mazda in Memphis. As I recall, we nearly walked out of the saleman's office (after more than an hour) because he kept playing price games with us. 

Over the years we�ve been very faithful about observing the maintenance schedule in the user�s manual, and changing the oil every three months. Covington Pike�s service department is not cheap, but they have always been extremely courteous and efficient in our dealings with them. Most importantly, they have maintained the car superbly.

Aside from its wonderful dependability, our 1991 Protege is a fairly typical Japanese subcompact. It is a 4-door sedan with A/C, 4-speaker AM/FM cassette stereo, and 5-speed manual transmission. Seating is comfortable for up to four medium-sized adults. Seating for very-large adults is uncomfortable (but does provide entertainment value for the regular-sized adults). Gas mileage is quite good, and acceleration is adequate. If the A/C is running, acceleration is weak. The A/C button is like an anti-turbo. Our model does not have cruise control, automatic windows, or automatic door locks.

I would recommend the Protege to anyone looking for a reliable, economical car. Purchasing a used car always involves an element of risk. You never really know how the previous owner(s) treated a car. A well-maintained Protege is hard to beat.
