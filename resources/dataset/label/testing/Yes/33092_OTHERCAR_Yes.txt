            OK, we have had our 1997 Previa AWD van now for about 2 months and have just completed a 5500 mile round trip north carolina to Seattle.  In a word, I love this van.  It is reliable and cruises at 75mph with 22mpg average for the trip.  It has tons of room and the seats up front (we have removed the middle and tipped up the back)  are the only seats I have ever found (include Porsche, Volvo, Ford, etc) that do not hurt my back when angled correctly etc.  It really is a nice car.   My car has  now 140,000 miles... scares you right?  Not to worry, if these cars have verifible service including the trans you are ok, I am told and it seems true.  Mine has all records on a single owner and it is CLEAN!

Here are the drawbacks: Most important the safety is not good by 2004 standards, average for 1997. Still it is better than some GM vans (check out safety sites) and it is not the car you will be speeding around in.  Sure I am concerned but all things considered since I wanted AWD I got the car and am happy
                        Second issue, the car is an orphan... the Toyota dealerships it seems have NO idea on how to work with this car and since it is different (Supercharger and motor down low in middle) they cover all bases and charge a ton to do anything... you need to have an independent who knows these cars.  For example, no trained toyota mechanic thinks you need to service the supercharger even though the manuals call for it and everyone on line says yes you do.  

Otherwise we love the car and enjoy the incredible AWD aspect of it.  If we could afford the new Sienna AWD we might do that but at 37,000$ it will be some time till we can afford it or the price drops used.
