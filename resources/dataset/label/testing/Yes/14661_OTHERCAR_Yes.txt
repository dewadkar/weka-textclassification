            Here's the short version: I'd buy another in a heartbeat. Read on for a longer review of this great little SUV.

First off, I'm a mother, not a mechanic. So don't expect any talk here about transmissions, drive trains, gear ratios, carburetors, etc. My perspective is based on the Forester's drivability and its merit as a family vehicle. My experience with the Forester is going on a little over a year now, and we have over 28,000 miles on it already. (I do a lot of driving, obviously, so I like to think I have a fair amount of credibility.) We bought ours after a friend showed us hers. Here, then, are some specific thoughts I've garnered on the Forester over this past year:

Drivability -- I know this is a very vague term, but I warned you that I'm not a mechanic. To me, this term best describes the Forester's feel to a driver. To me, the feel is one of total control. This is extremely important to me, because we live in the Puget Sound area, where slick roads and rainy commutes are the norm. Circumstances require that I drive about 80 miles a day with my two boys, and I have never felt as safe doing that as I do now with the Forester. We were aware when we bought it that it rated high in safety and crash tests, and we can believe it just by driving it ourselves. The vehicle is extremely responsive--it does what you want it to do. I've never had any sensation of slipping or sliding, even in the worst of weather, thanks to the all-wheel drive. It just flat-out feels secure. I used to dread making the morning drive in bad weather with the Civic. Not any more. Besides that, it's just plain fun to drive!

Comfort -- After years of driving a Honda Civic, the Forester feels more like a medium-to-full-sized car. In my previous job I had the opportunity to drive many different sizes and makes of vehicles. Outside of a Chevy Caprice, the Forester is as comfortable as any of them were. (Nonetheless, I'd still opt for the Forester simply because the Caprice was too big. I felt like I was navigating a barge when I drove it.) The Forester's seats have raised sides so that your arms have support even without an armrest. (The armrest, or lack of one, caused some concern with us at first, but we quickly discovered it's not necessary, or even desirable anymore. It is an optional accessory if you really can't do without.)

Space -- The front area is great for adults, with plenty of room horizontally and vertically. Very tall people can sit in the Forester comfortably and still have head room. The back, to be honest, is a little cramped for adults, but not severely so. I have two little boys, one still in a carseat, and it's fine for them. Storage space is more than ample. There is a large holding area behind the back seats, neatly designed to make maximum use of the space. The spare tire (full size!), for example, fits in a compartment beneath the cargo area so as not to take up extra room. There is also a nifty pull-over cover in the back that hides your gear from prying eyes. And if you still need more room, the rear seats fold down to an almost completely flat position.

Style -- Well, for the most part this is a subjective section, but, c'mon, you've got to admit that the Forester is kinda cute (or handsome, depending on your gender). One of the things that attracted us to it was its hybrid quality. It wasn't a car, yet is wasn't a monster-sized suburban assault vehicle. On the other hand, it offered the best of both of those options: a comfortable, higher-up ride with all-wheel drive and cargo space.

Durability -- This is as mechanical as I'm going to get: 28,000 miles without any problems, major or minor. We've had oil changes done every 5,000 or so.

Gas mileage -- Okay, it's not as good as the Civic was, but it's not a gas guzzler either, unlike the larger SUV's. It's what we expected from doing our homework.

Interior and Extras -- It's a straight-forward interior, but it works. The controls are laid out in a sensible, convenient fashion, are easy to reach and easy to use. You don't have to paw around to find what you need. The cup holders are convenient and plentiful (one on the front dash, one in the armrest area, and two in the back). Where the armrest would normally be is a roomy covered storage space. There are plenty of other cubby holes for stashing your stuff in the doors and on the dash, as well as the glove box. Above the rear-view mirror is compartment for sunglasses as well as a clock and manually-controlled interior/reading lights. Stereo works great. Heating and cooling system operate just fine. Seats adjust without problems. And I love the rubber mat in the cargo area; it keeps grocercies from sliding around. 

So there you have it. The Forester is a great niche vehicle between car and truck. I love mine, and I'd highly recommend it.<br><br>
