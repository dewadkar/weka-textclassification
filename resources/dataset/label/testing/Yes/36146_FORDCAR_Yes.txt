            My husband drives long haul for a living and we purchased a Focus because he wanted me to have a dependable car for getting the kids around.  The price was right also.  It handled wonderfully, very nice to drive.  Anyone with long legs shouldn't purchase a Focus though because there isn't much leg room, especially in the back.  We would have kept ours for a very long time if it wouldn't have been for the dealership we purchased it from.  There were major water leaks in ours, and they did nothing to fix them.  All they wanted to do for me is replace the carpet.  Also, the vehicle we traded in for this car was a big conversion van.  Compared to the van, this car was pretty darn loud driving down the road.  The tire noise was loud, and also you could feel every bump in the road.  I suppose I was just spoiled with my van!  In closing, very nice little car, just don't buy one from the same dealership I did!<br><br>
