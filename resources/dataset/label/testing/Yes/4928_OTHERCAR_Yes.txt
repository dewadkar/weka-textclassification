            First and foremost, I would like to thank all the Tundra owners at <b>www.tundrasolutions.com</b> for providing an unbelievable amount of help, knowledge and ideas to make my Tundra just right for me.  I used to like my truck "all right", and the great folks over there made it possible for me to love it.  Just click on "Register", it's free.  If you don't own a Tundra yet, these people will give you the straight poop, they're regular folks just like you and me.

<b>How I got to the Tundra:</b>  I have slowly been upgrading my ride, and recently traded my 2001 Nissan Frontier for an '03 Toyota Tundra SR5 4X4 with TRD package, tow package, cold weather package and.... that's it.  It was $30k out-the-dooor, 3.9% APR on a 60 month loan with good cash-back incentive (economy was slow, so we bent the dealer over).  Now I must confess something, something that will make all red-blooded meat-eating woman-fondling American men angry: I think the big 3 (Ford, Chevy, GMC) turn out junk.  They're un-reliable, easily broken parts buckets.  <i>Unfortunately</i>, if you want anything over 1/2 ton you've got no choice.  <i>Fortunately</i>, 1/2 ton is enough for me.  My last Ford blew up while I drove it, and my wife's Explorer has been recalled three (!) times.  Nope.  Chevy ain't much better,  my boss has a Silverado 2500 HD, his second, and he says it's the only one so far that he hasn't had to replace the clutch on.  Last one, he replaced it 3 times!  Nope.  And Nissan doesn't make full size (I bought my Tundra pre-Titan), so that left me with Toyota.  Here's what I think now that I have owned it for 7 months.

<b>Interior:</b>  Basic and straight forward.  The controls and overall layout can be seen as either a positive or a negative: If you are looking for a flashy, modern interior with lots of cool gadgets and clever ideas, this ain't it.  If you are looking for a simple and easy to use interior that stays clean and is ergonomically correct, this one's very good.  I particularly like the stereo, it's very simple and easy to operate.  Also, the stock speaker system is plenty good enough for 95% of owners out there.  My Nissan Frontier needed new speakers right away, the stock ones really sucked.  But not the Tundra, it's plenty base-y and clear.  There's tons of leg room and the cab is more than big enough to be comfortable.  Biggest issue with the interior is the utterly useless rear seat.  It's waaaay too small for any normal sized human to use, and also the back of the seat takes up at least a 1/3 of the useable cab spcae in the rear.  It's really the worst of both worlds: Too uncomfortable for passengers, too passenger oriented for tools.  I solved that problem by removing the entire rear seat (very easy to do, actually) and building a very nice "tool deck" with matching carpet upholstry, once that seat is out of there there's <b>tons</b> of room that can be used if you have any imagination at all.  The  drivers seat is a little flat, sometimes it feels like you would slide off of it under hard braking, and I never could find a really comfortable spot for my right leg.  I actually drove with a rolled up towel under my leg (behind the knee) for a long time, it really made a difference.  Then I realized that the best thing to do was to tilt the front edge of the seat up.  Only two bolts hold the front onto the carriage that the whole seat slides on, so I replaced them with longer bolts and spacers, raising the front edge of the seat 1.75 inches.  Now it's great! Be sure to use the right grade bolts, or safety might be compromised. Also, if you drive at night a lot, do this: Take a small screwdriver and push in the hinge edge of the interior light cover (the lense that you push to turn the lights on).  Remove the lense, and you'll see a metal plate attached to the lense that's restricting light flow.  Take it off both lenses, then replace the lenses over the lights.  Bingo, bright light in the cab at night!

<b>Exterior:</b>  Pretty bland, all things taken together.  The new grille is a love it or hate it affair, with most folks hating it.  I personally like it, I think it does a nice job of setting the Tundra apart from its American bretheren.  My only complaint: Why don't *all* '03 and up Tundras come with a color-keyed grille like the Limited edition?  It looks SOOOOOO much better than the cheesy chrome strips!  And those chrome strips are there to stay, so forget about taking them off.  Sighhhhh.  Otherwise, the exterior is basic truck.  The suicide doors are nice, and designed so that no metal parts of the front and rear door touch, so when you close them in the wrong order or too fast, nothing gets dinged or bent.  Good thinking.  The bed is a little shallow compared to the big 3's beds, and it bothers me.  Also, I really (really really really) wish they offered the Access Cab Tundras with a full length bed.  The only way to get full length, tho, is regular cab.  No thanks.  I basically felt that the Tundra's looks were a little too "soft" for my liking, especially compared to the new Chevy front ends with the "scowling" headlights.  So, to toughen up the look of my truck and add protection to the rear-window and cab corners, I got a Rack It full mesh cab protector.  Gotta special-order the full mesh version, but is's worth it, looks much better than the weird rectangle version.  Don't bother looking on the web, you won't find it.  Call your local truck store.  Other than that, the exterior is very nicely put together, in the critical "fit-and-finish" category Toyota gets an A+. 

<b>Ride:</b>  The ride from the factory is really amazing: It drives like you'd expect a Cadillac to drive.  Very very soft suspension soaks up bumps and pot holes with nary a jostle, a friend of mine described it as being "...like driving a couch!"  Lots of truck people won't like this ride, and I myself got tired of it after a while.  Why?  The truck wallows.  It pitches and yaws in corners like you wouldn't believe, and there's no feedback.  A sporting ride this ain't.  Again, tundrasolutions.com to the rescue.  I  installed a Hellwig rear anti-sway bar, and WOW!  The truck stays level now in the corners, and the ride is a TON better!  Should have come from the factory like this.  And, since the front end droops over 2 inches and drives pretty mushy, I installed Wheeler coilovers, replacing the stock springs that are on the front suspension.  WOW again! The truck is level now, giving it the beefy 4X4 appearance that it deserves.  Also, the front handling now matches the rear, that is firmer than stock and better handling and response.  Money well spent.  I am not an off-road person, only occaisional forays, but by all reports the Tundra is very capable straight from the show room.  I'll never know.

<b>Niggling complaints:</b>  Size: This truck is just plain smaller than all the other full-sized trucks out there.  In a city, this would be a benefit.  The size thing grates on me a bit, but I didn't buy this truck to impress others.  Just don't expect to block the sun when you are next to any other trucks on the road.  And, the sound.  Granted, the cab is dead quiet at any speed, you just can't hear any road or engine noise.  To me, that's a problem.  I bought a V8, now I want to hear it!  Accordingly, a Bassani (The Quiet Sound of Thunder, doncha know) exhaust system is on its way.  Problem solved, again.

For me, the truck as  purchased wasn't perfect, but still a mile better than what the big 3 offer.  After roughly $2k in improvements, this truck ROCKS.  And, it will last forever.  5 years from now I'll still have it, while my friends and co-workers will already be on their 2nd, 3rd, whatever Ford/Chevy/GMC.  This is THE truck for anyone who drives a lot (I put on over 2k a month) and needs a truck that's comfortable, powerful (245 horses) and easy on the maintenance.

This truck does everything I need with no complaint or problem, i just got done remodelling my back yard and spent 4 days hauling 7,000 lbs per load of dirt out of there in a big trailer, up a hill and had no problems.  The truck with tow package is rated to pull 7,200 lbs, and that's enough for anyone. 

Gas mileage is class standard at 14-15 MPG, so not great, but hey, it's a V8!

This truck isn't really cut out for hard-core professional work, such as construction or farm work.  But, for the $30k even it cost me with everything loaded on (tow package, winter package, Toyota Racing Development off road package, cd player, power everything, heated mirrors, 4wd etc.) I got wayyyy more truck than that same 30k would buy from, say, chevy.  A comprably equipped chevy silverado runs close to $40k, out of my price range.  

If you want an ultra-reliable work truck that will do just about everything you need and be a comfortable ride day in and day out, this is your baby.
