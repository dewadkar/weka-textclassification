            I wasn't sure at first. But now I am. Chevy has really done a nice job with this Z24. For starters, its power to weight ratio is nice. It lacks alot of low end torque, which I got used to having a taurus, but at 5600 it pulls beautifully. The inline-4 engine produces a sweet sound, similar to the sound produced by 3 series inline 4 BMW's. It is actually roomy inside but the back seat is a bit cramped. For singles, it ROCKS! 

The Z24 comes fully loaded and compared with a civic SI, which I debated, it comes with more standard features which would make the SI go over 20 grand. It comes with anti-theft, highway lights, and spoiler standard as well as much larger tires (205 versus Civic SI 195).

The milage is also great as well as the suprising smooth ride. I had driven cavaliers over many years and this is the best handling cavariel ever. It is glued to the road. The engine works quite a bit to get you up to speed through the corners or on highways but once there, it's smooth sailing. 

I also like the one-touch moon-roof and the fold down back seat.

People who need alot of space shouldn't buy this car. <br><br>
