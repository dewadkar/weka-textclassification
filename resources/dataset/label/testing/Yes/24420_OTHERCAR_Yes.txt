            I bought the Sony DSC-S50 about a year ago, and have used it extensively.  I thought it would be nice to share my experiences and thoughts about this camera with the rest of the world.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
The DSC-S50 is a 2.2 megapixel digital camera, which records in resolutions from 640x480 to 1600x1200.  The method of storage is the Sony Memory Stick which is a card about the size and thickness of half a stick of chewing gum.  Memory sticks come in storage sizes from 4mb to 64mb, although anything less than 16mb is a waste of money (in my humble opinion) because they just don't hold enough pictures.  The DSC-S50 has a 2-inch rotatable viewscreen, mounted on the back, and is powered by a sony "smart" Li-Ion battery, which mounts in the side.  The DSC-S50 sells for about $700.00 (US), although you can probably find one for about $599.00.

STUFF THAT I LIKE:

THE BATTERY:
The battery lasts for a LONG time.  I have a spare, but have never had to use it.  You can expect the battery to last for 4-6 hours of "on-time" on a single charge.  The Li-Ion battery is also "smart", and can tell you (Accurately!) how much time you have left before power runs out.

THE MEMORY STICK:
These are a massive improvement over diskette based and fixed memory storage solutions.  While a bit pricey (64mb about $130.00), they are infinitely reusable, and I have never run out of storage carrying two 64mb and one 32mb memory stick.

THE PICTURES:
The pictures this camera takes are AWESOME.  Great color, contrast and sharpness.  Rivals the best 35mm camera photos for sure.

THE CONVENIENCE:
This is a big deal for me.  You can strap this camera to your arm or belt, whip it out in a flash, and take some pictures wherever you are at.  Then, you can review all the shots you've taken using the viewscreen, delete any you don't care for, and continue on your merry way.  Who could ask for anythig more!!!  When you're done, you go home, plug your camera into your PC, download the photos, and print the ones you want.  No more changing film.  No more developing costs.  No more hassles!  WOW!

MINI-MOVIES:
The DSC-S50 has the ability to make 15 second .AVI movies (with sound), that will play on your PC.  This is a nice feature, and comes in handy when someone does something really stupid/funny.  The .AVI gets recorded at a reduced resolution, and needs proper lighting, but looks and sounds pretty good if all conditions are right.  Because of the reduced resolution, these .AVI files do not eat up as much space as you might think.

STUFF THAT I DO NOT LIKE:

NO VIEWFINDER:
The viewscreen is just fine for most situations, but a viewfinder would have been a nice feature to include.  The problem comes in when you want to use the camera in direct sunlight.  The LCD screen can't possibly compete with the intensity of the sun, which results in you not being able to see squat on the screen.  What this means is that you are just pointing the camera in a general direction and shooting, which can result in some lousy framing.  A viewfinder would have fixed this problem.  Another benefit of a viewfinder would have been the ability to shut off the LCD screen and conserve battery power.

THE INCLUDED MEMORY STICK:
Sony ships a 4mb memory stick with each new DSC-S50.  This is totally inadequate, as a 4mb will only hold about 8 pictures at 1024x768.  Good for memory stick sales, bad for the consumer.  I'm not sure what Sony was thinking here.  Money, probably.

THE PRICE:
For me, $700.00 is a little pricey.  It could be argued that the camera will pay for itself in saved film processing fees, but when you add in the price of additional memory sticks, it'd take quite while to pay this baby off.  I'd say $500.00 would be a fair price.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
If you are looking for a good full-featured digital camera, I would recommend the DSC-S50.  The resolution is great (sure, you can buy a camera with 3 or greater megapixels, but are the additional expense and storage requirements worth it - I think not), the convenience is unparalleled, and the pictures are incredible.  A little pricey, but I think it is worth it, overall.

Highly recommended.  That's my two cents.
