            This is a great camera with the optical zoom of 8X for a 2.2 Meg camera at the $199 purchase price (Wal-Mart).  It was almost too much camera for me, but it is great.

The easy navagation from the  LCD is good, and the software for camera downloading pictures set up a nice photo sorting system.  It is USB linked, and there is a cheap card reader.  The software is friendly and easy.  

The bad is no sound for the MPEG movies, few accessories, and typical battery eating digital costs(remedied with NiCad/metal rechargeable batteries).  This alright for a $200 camera, and common with this camera tier.

The swivel lens allows me to adjust for glare, and this helps with indoor picts.

The picture menu has a selected frame for an automatic shot preparation, this is great, but not necessary.

I really really recommend this camera, when you consider the customer support, quality of images, swivel lens, and price range.  I have not seen anything to make me second guess this purchase.
