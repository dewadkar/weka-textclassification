            As has always been the case, purchasing a new car is an experience shaped by futility, exorbitant cost and diminishing returns.
 All for what&gt;? The new car smell?  

And of used cars, there are very few redeemable qualities seen in dealers of these sorts. Purchasing a used car is marginally cheaper than buying a new one but it's almost always a craps shoot unless you've done thorough VIN research and have the uncanny ability to detect and troubleshoot a myriad of potential problems. 
. 
So what is the Alternative??
(Refrain from laughter please) 
                            Junkers.
Don't stop reading now if you've come this far it's worth it to read the rest. 

Cars purchased at your local junkyard -
They are available courtesy of today�s throwaway society for $300-1000 at your local junkyard. These are point A to point B cars which can be purchased and fixed at a fraction of the cost of a new car and with surprisingly less aggravation and cost than a used one. A little research and time can award you with a respectable car that offers all the reliability of a limited warranty used one without any of the gimmicks or fast talk.

Once you discover all of the benefits there are to breaking the new and used car paradigms, you may never go back. Not having to worry about a scratch or a dent, unscrupulous insurance rates or thievery bolsters enough support. Unquestionably however, the savings you�ll enjoy are by and large the biggest benefit.

To start, there is very little haggling at purchase and depending upon the vehicle, the $300-400 you'll spend on repairs will carry you a lot further than you think.  As an added bonus, if you're handy and have patience and a place to work, you'll spend next to nothing by purchasing most of your parts right at the junkyard you bought it at (usually they'll give you a great deal of extras free just for your loyal patronage.)

I've done the math a hundred times but here is an example to demonstrate 
My point.
I picked up a circa 1985 CAR AND DRIVER magazine and looked at the top vehicles of that year. I also picked up a book called LEMONCARS and I compared and contrasted the results. My conclusion was that I would purchase either a Honda Accord or a Volvo 240. After having looked in several junkyards I found there were combined a dozen of these cars at my disposal.

I didn't have to wait in any lines nor did I have to listen to a ranting idiot salesman with a toupee. I just sat in each of the cars adjusted the seat and started them up (a few needed some irredeemable help).  An employee named Julio (certainly no salesman) was very helpful in diagnosing malfunctions and inexpensive remedies to them. He told me what each of them would need to pass the stringent Massachusetts vehicle inspection law. 

After having the pick of the litter I decided on a 1985 Volvo Wagon (technically a 245)(see bottom for tech specs and link)(with 202k miles on it (still worthy of another 100k because of it�s over-engineered engine). It cost me $500. It needed a transmission mount (common for those cars) and an alternator along with a little TLC. They were more than willing to do the work there for a nominal fee of $100.

I got all the lights, fuses and doodads necessary for my inspection sticker. The only real work I needed to do was a body patch for a portion of the underbody on the driver�s side rear wheel well (it was easy with sheet metal and screws) along with a quick tune up and new tires (on sale at Sears). 
The result:
 A reliable, presentable car, which has lasted me the better part of a year, hassle free. 

Here is my itemization:
Used 245 DL Volvo wagon.......$500
Onsite Repairs................$100
tune up parts.................$37
2 used tires mounted, balanced.$56
Insurance for 1 year..........$650.(MA has some of the highest rates in the nation)
Knowing that I saved at least $6k on a used one and close to $26k on a new one.......................Priceless!
Total: $693 w/ o insurance.

Take the 26K savings from the new one, and buy an appreciating asset like a house. Better yet, invest it in a competitive mutual fund and you can, on the interest alone easily purchase a new Junker every year, never again worrying about a car

1985 model:
1985 - B230F engine is introduced. New engine has lightweight pistons, black valve cover, and a different crankshaft. All Canadian 240s and U.S. 240GL/Turbo models have switchable (read: functional) driver side bun warmers. New rear wiper and arm. All cars gain rear fog lights in certain parts of the U.S.A. Diesel discontinued. Last year of Turbo model. New radios. LH-Jetronic version 2.2 introduced on B230F. Fully Galvanized sheet metal introduced. Parking brake console has cutouts for bun warmer switches, but 1985 models used a switch on the dash control panel. Temperature compensating board added to temperature gauge. Temp gauge and fuel gauge lose H/C, F/E markings
