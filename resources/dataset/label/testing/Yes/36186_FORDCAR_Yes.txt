            We got a brand new Ford Focus the day after Thanksgiving.  Ours is red and a two door.  I really like it. It is a sporty car and a fairly affordable one.  It has a CD player.  On the key ring it has an unlock and lock button and also a trunk and panic button.  It is really roomy and has lots of trunk space.  The salesman who sold it to us was six foot tall and could get in the back seat and be comfortable with lots of leg room and space.  This car is so fun to drive.  It drives smooth and brakes easy.  The only thing I wish I would've thought about was getting a four door.  We have a three month old son and since he isn't twenty pounds yet he faces backwards and it is hard to put him in the car.<br><br>
