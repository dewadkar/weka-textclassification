            Okay, this is the second part of the Sienna learning.  As of my first opinion, you read how good it was, similar features as the Honda Odyssey, well, i'm back for more.  The standard features, first of all we have the trim LE, the standard features are: SAFETY: DR &amp; FR PASSENGER AIRBAGS
(SRS) - CHILD PROTECTOR SLIDING DR LOCKS - LOW TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT (ABS)
- DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS--- EXTERIOR: DRIVER/PASS SIDE SLIDING DOOR - REAR WINDOW WIPERS - RR WINDOW DEFOGGER-HVY W/TIMER--- COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE:
- CRUISE CONTROL / DUAL AIR COND.- DLX ETR/CASS W/4 SPEAKERS - AUTO-OFF HEADLAMPS/TACHOMETER.|||||||||| The other options or you can call it accessories are POWER SLIDING DOOR...RIGHT SIDE ONLY- SECURITY PACKAGE- 
KEYLESS ENTRY- ALLOY WHLS W/FULL SIZE SPARE TIRE.   This minivan can attract you so much.  If you bought you're own Sienna, you will love it so much.  The interior is really beautiful, and the features as you read can be really usefull to use, and it can be really stress free.  Other features<br><br>
