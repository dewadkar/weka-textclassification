            We bought a 90 used Mazda 626 LX. Although it is very old, I like it no argument. I have used it more than one year. So far it is good. There was not large repairing, just regular oil change. It has power windows, power locks, big trunk, sunroof, and large space for driver and passengers. The most important is its economic. 30 miles per gallon in local driving!! Can you believe it that it is a ten years old car? We use it more than another car right now because of the gas price. It saves our much money! <br><br>
