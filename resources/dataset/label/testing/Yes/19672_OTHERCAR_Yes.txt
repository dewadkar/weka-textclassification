            I love my Saturn. We bought ours about a year ago and have found everything to be wonderful with our car. When we went to buy our car everyone at our Saturn dealership was friendly and helpful. There was no pushing us to buy something that we didn't want or getting any extras. They basically just clued us in on to the different features they had to offer. The only problem that we had was when my husband flipped the AC to defrost and the cord broke. The Saturn dealership got us in within the week and the problem was fixed in a timely manner and the people were great. We were talking with other Saturn car owners and they totally agreed with us. They loved their cars. They drive great, good gas mileage, and are very roomy. <br><br>
