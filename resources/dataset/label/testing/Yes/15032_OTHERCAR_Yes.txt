            Let me just start out by saying that I love love love my Sony Mavica FD73 camera. I am a SAHM of 2. I a 2 1/2 year old and a 11 month old. This camera has came in handy for me so many times. I love capturing my childrens funny and first moments in one manner or another. It is very hard for me to get my video camera ready in enough time to capture the action my child is doing at that moment. But with my Mavica it is just a snap of my fingers. All you have to do is grab a disk pop it in and you are ready to go!! This camera is the easiest digital camera to use by far in my opinion. It has taken many great pictures in door and outdoor. I love the zoom feature. I love sitting outside watching the birds in my front yard. One day I saw a beautiful cardinal sitting high up in a tree and I wanted to get a close up  of it. I wasn't sure if I could but I started zooming in on it and I got closer than I ever imagined I could. The picture turned out wonderful all thanks to my wonderful Mavica ;o) The only thing that this camera does that I do not like is take grainy pictures with no flash. I have found that when the flash does not go off and you are taking the picture indoors it will more times that not come out grainy. That is my only problem. When I am outdoors and the flash doesn't go off the picture is fine. If I am indoors and the flash goes off the picture is VERY clear. I do need to mention that this was the 4th digital camera that I bought. None of the others I purchased even began to compare to this wonderful camera ;o)<br><br>
