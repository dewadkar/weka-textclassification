            The Chevy Blazer has got to be one of the best SUVs in the industry.  It's relative low price, dependability and clean look give it four stars in my book.  The Blazer is perfect the guy (or girl) who wants an SUV but doesn't like the huge, overbulked, Bronco-types out there.  It offers a compact alternative still roomy enough to comfortably seat five people and offers ample luggage space.  The four wheel drive option gives you guys who are looking for a little off road fun all you can handle.  It's lightweight makes it ideal in offroad situations and the handling gives you total control. <br><br>
