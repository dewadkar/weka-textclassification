            I bought the Honda Civic because it was cute, economical, and had a good safety record.  I'm definitely glad I did!  

The look was simple and attractive, and the car was easy to drive. It had only a 4-cylinder engine, so wasn't what you'd call a muscle car, but it had a quick pickup, and I had no problems getting speed when I needed it.

I drove it for almost a year before I had a serious accident... a drunk driver turned right in front of me, causing me to hit him before plunging across a median and having a head-on with an oncoming car at about 45 mph.  Believe it or not, I walked away, shaken but not seriously injured.  

The airbag bruised my chest a bit, and the seat belt left a small cut on my collarbone, but it could have been much worse. The dashboard cracked and there were large cracks in the windshield, but the windshield did not shatter, and no glass actually entered the front seat. The entire front of the car crumpled from the front bumper to a point right about at the middle of the hood, leaving the front seat and the entire passenger compartment completely intact.

Needless to say, the car was completely totalled, but thanks to good safety features, I was fine. I couldn't have asked for a car to protect me better in such a serious crash.
