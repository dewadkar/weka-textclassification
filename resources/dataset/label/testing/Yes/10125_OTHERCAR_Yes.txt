            I bought &quot;Puppy&quot; brand new in 1994. He was my second Mazda. My first was an '88 &quot;323&quot;. The for runner to the Protege. I have personally never known a dissatisfied Mazda owner. 

Puppy and I drove around the country together for 6 and a half weeks ( 2 years ago). I have the car serviced regularly as recommended and have absolutely no problems with it. 

I love the front wheel drive, which handles beautifully here on some very dangerous windy mountain roads. Its a fun car to drive. Comfortable and responsive. For the price you cant beat it. It still gets compliments after nearly six years. 

I love my car! <br><br>
