            I drove an old Mustang once and hated it but it sure was a cool looking car. The Acclaim is good looking and a much better car. I bought mine from Brookdale Chrysler years ago as a rental return. I can't think of a better way to buy a vehicle. I considered the purchase as being next to new with a lower price. It was well taken care of and clean with around fifteen thousand miles. I used it all the time. It ended up being a courier car. Now you wouldn't think that a four cylinder car would last forever. Let me tell that it lasted for 244,000 miles and still used very little oil. The body stayed intact. Except for the electrical problems stated in other opinions, I loved it.
  I hated giving it up. I lived in for eight to ten hours a day. I traded it in for a Dodge Spirit. I am told the Spirit took the Acclaims place. Whatever! I was satisfied that I got my money's worth in-spite of wear and tear problems and the fact I was very satisfied with it.
  Funny thing, the day I decided to give it up, the dealer took it as a trade in for the Dodge Spirit. He said the Acclaim looked tired. It was. But I got a new car a good deal and kept driving for awhile longer. <br><br>
