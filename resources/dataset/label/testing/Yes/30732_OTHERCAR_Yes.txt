            General Impression:
First let me state that I am an actual owner of this van and not someone who has just taken a test drive.  I have owned this van since August of '03.  My wife and I were probably one of the first three people in our market to purchase a 2004 Quest.  We had wanted to buy a minivan for some time, but we really wanted to get a good look at the new Quest before we paid full sticker and got the run around from the Toyota guys.  Boy am I glad we did! About one week after the official release date my dealer called and had the exact vehicle that matched my exact specifications.  I bought that vehicle the same day.  My wife had previously been driving a Nissan Maxima which she adored so the thought of driving a minivan everyday was not exactly appealing to her.  The Quest changed her mind in one test drive.  I personally didn't really care what it looked like as I was more concerned with the engineering and since it had the proven Maxima/350z engine powering it my fears were put to rest.  We seriously considered the Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna, but my wife felt the interior styling of the Odyssey was just too plain so it was removed from the purchasing equation.  My wife was not offended by the looks of the Toyota Sienna, but not impressed either.  Plus, the Toyota dealerships in my area acted like they were selling oxygen and they were the only source of it in town.  They wouldn&#146t even carry on a conversation concerning price.  You would pay full MSRP (or more) or leave.  The lackluster exterior styling and Toyota&#146s attitude helped to rule out the Sienna for us.  My good friend and next door neighbor just purchased a 2004 Toyota Sienna and while it is an extremely nice vehicle, it still looks like every other minivan out there.....except the Quest.  

Styling:
This is probably the thing that most stands out about this vehicle.  People have literally followed my wife and me around parking lots and waited till we stop to ask us about our vehicle.  It seems that everywhere we go people are either commenting about how much they like the vehicle or they want to know more about it. It makes my wife proud of her vehicle

Interior:
It takes about 10 minutes to get used to the console being in the center of the dash, but after that you begin to realize that from an engineering standpoint it is probably better anyways.  You view ALL your controls in one location which I believe gives the driver more time to keep your eyes on the road.   I do at times wish that the third-row solid bench was a 60/40 split.  I haven't had a need yet to use that kind of feature, but I believe that Toyota does have a better solution in this regard.  We believe all seats are comfortable and there is plenty of leg room in all seats.  I'm 6' and my wife is 5'10" and we have no issues sitting in any seat in the van.  The lowering sequence for the rear seat is extremely easy and I truly don't understand how anyone could have issues with Nissan's design in this regard.  The rear cargo area is extremely spacious and we have yet had to lower the rear seat on any grocery shopping trip to feed our family of 4.  The cargo area is deceiving to the eye at first.  When you look at it you might get the impression that it's not really that large, but wait until you actually start loading up some cargo.  The sliding doors open very wide and that makes access to the third-row very easy.  I can even place my 6-month old child in her carrier base in the rear seat without even placing foot in the actual van itself.



Driving and Performance:
What more can I say except that is has the Maxima/350z engine that delivers 240HP.  Someone stated that the Quest could be called the Maxima Minivan and I would certainly agree with that.  Power is abundant and available at the slightest press of the accelerator. A few other reviewers have mentioned there are some squeaks in the new Quest and I will admit that at first we had them as well.  There is a TSB out that address this concern and it involves a minor adjustment of both the rear sliding doors.  My dealer performed this adjustment and after that all my squeaks were gone.  All new vehicles have a few things here and there that need adjustment so I don't blame Nissan for my initial squeak issue.  There is some slight body flex but nothing so dramatic that it makes me worry.  I personally like cars that are sport oriented and feel like they are riding on rails.  While I wouldn't say that personifies the Quest, I would say that I'm not displeased with its handling either.  Corner body roll that is normally associated with larger SUV's seems almost non-existent in the Quest.  I feel confident in being able to control our Quest in 8 lanes of congested interstate traffic.   While the turning radius of the Quest is not like that of a Honda Civic coupe, it's certainly no slouch either.  It's not bad, it&#146s not great, but it's good enough.


Fuel Economy:
Our Quest was listed a 19MPG City and 25MPG Highway.  We are now at roughly 3300 miles and I can say that those figures appear to be fairly accurate.  We generally average about 18.5 in the city and last road trip we took we average about 24.  However, we were told by our dealership that generally after the first 5000 miles that our fuel economy should increase due to the engine being fully broken-in.  I don't know if that is fact or not but we will find out soon enough.

Complaints:
I really only have one complaint at this point is that our SL Quest came equipped with side roof rails.  When we inquired to Nissan about adding crossbars in order to secure rooftop luggage we were told that the crossbars were only available if we had an SE version.  Although the rail dimensions are exactly the same you still can't buy the crossbars and have them installed by your Nissan dealership.  This issue ended up at the Quest engineering group who came back with that answer.  According to the owner's manual you cannot store luggage on top without these crossbars so what is a Quest owner to do you ask.....buy aftermarket crossbars.  That was Nissan's response to me after all was said and done.  I personally believe it makes absolutely no sense for them to sell a vehicle designed as a people-moving, family vehicle that does not even have the capability to carry rooftop luggage.
