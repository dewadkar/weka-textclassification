               <b>The MR2</b> was one of the finest handling Japanese sports cars of the 1980s, however the 1990s models are even better! They are longer in length, more powerful, and better equipped. When Toyota added a turbocharger, this car instantly had Maserati/Ferrari rivaling performance! The name MR2 captures 3 major features of this car; M stands for 'mid engine' R stands for 'rear wheel drive,' and the 2 stands for 'two seater.'


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

   <b>The 1995 Toyota MR2 is fast!</b> Power is readily available from the turbocharged engine at almost idle with virtually no turbo lag whatsoever and kicks in at full throttle at just over 2,000 RPM. To fully exploit this power, though, you need to rev the engine hard, but that is all part of the fun factor of this 'super' Toyota. Overall stability, and <b>superior handling</b> insure that the power to the rear wheels is perfectly controlled, even when the rear kicks out on a wide corner or bend at full throttle. The 1995 MR2 is one of best handling cars I have ever driven, and has superior road manners that can match even expensive sports cars of today.  
Simple to drive, and near supercar acceleration make this car a blast to drive. 0-60 times  have been reported as low as 6 seconds flat, right out of the box. <b>The brakes</b> are superb, the vented disc brakes perform very well, and show no sign of fade under heavy use.  
        
Like some mid-engined cars, the earlier MR2's were a little twitchy when cornering at high speeds. Handling modifications introduced for the 1994 model year rectified this problem by adding taller tires, a revised Macpherson strut <b>suspension</b>, and a limited slip differential. Four wheel vented disc brakes are fitted, unlike the non turbo model which only has discs at the front as standard equipment.

   To achieve large amounts of power from just 2.0 liters, Toyota uses modern 16 valve technology, twin camshafts, a variable induction system, a high-pressure turbocharger, and an intercooler. Peak power( 200hp) from the iron block engine is only achieved when you push the engine to a high revving 6,000 RPM. Kinda reminds me of the Honda's S2000's engine in a way, only this 2.0 engine has enough torque in high gear, thanks to the turbo, to tackle steep freeway hills with no problem. Maximum torque is 200lb-ft at only 3,200 RPM! Although the MR2 Turbo offers extraordinary power, especially from such a small displacement engine, reliability and overall build quality are not compromised whatsoever. Another vehicle that boasts this sort of performance and quality is the <a href="/content_55889989252"> 1995-1999 Mitsubishi eclipse turbos</a>. Even with 10 more horse power than the MR2, they are a little slower due to weight, but they are a blast to drive as well. The Eclipse Turbo also costs much less, and is much easier to find! 


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

    The <b>interior</b> of my long term tester MR2 turbo was typically Japanese which was dressed in black. Black cloth seats, black steering wheel, and carpet, etc.. Ergonomics are fair, and the MR2 turbo comes with power everything! The MR2 also comes with an excellent thick leather wrapped steering wheel, and boost gauge. The stereo in this car was not stock, this car had an 8 speaker Alpine system ,so I can not comment on stock sound. The seats are very supportive and comfortable, the 5-speed gear shifter is a little small, but you get used to it. There is plenty of room up front, and decent luggage space.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

  The <b>exterior</b> is as original as they get. The MR2 is definitely a head turner. The MR2 comes equipped with a large spoiler, pop-up headlights, dual exhaust, and large side vents, where air is fed directly to the engine. Stock wheels are 15" alloys.

  I do not own this car so I can not comment on reliability personally, but my Father in law's had something like 60,000 miles on it, lives in Palm Springs where its 100  everyday in the summer, and he has had no mechanical problems  whatsoever.  This car can hardly be found, only a handful were shipped to the united states (8,000 or so with the U.S.A). There are way more naturally aspirated models out there for less money , but power is nowhere near as high. From what I hear, they are still a very fun car to drive. 

<b>Prices</b> for the non turbo models are in the $14,000 dollar range for 1995. A turbo model, if you find one, will probably run you close to what they were new, which was around $33,000.
