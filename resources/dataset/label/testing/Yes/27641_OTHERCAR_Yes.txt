            My experience is limited to the 560SEL that I have been driving with my learner's permit, and which will probably be my first car here in the next few weeks.

This is one of the last cars that Mercedes made before they had to compete with the Japanese and, to a lesser extent, the Americans. At one time, Mercedes could sell their cars no matter how expensive they were (1979 450SEL 6.9, MSRP of $40,000+ IN 1979!) because the people that bought them understood that it was essentially an admission fee. Mercedes made some of the best cars in the world, and that level of reliability, luxury, and performance costs money. 

In the 1990s, the people buying luxury cars changed. The people that were buying them were, in general unwilling to pay the premium for the Mercedes over a Lexus or Infiniti. They didn't understand why they should pay upwards of $100k for a Mercedes instead of $45 for a LS400 or Q45.

The answer is simple: the Mercedes is a better car. Unfortunately, since people started buying the Japanese cars (which copy a lot of things from Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche), Mercedes had to cut costs to compete. What this means is that while the new Mercedes are excellent cars, they really don't make them like they used to.

As for the 560SEL itself, it was the top of the line Mercedes sedan from 1986-1991 or 1992. It had a 238hp 5.6 liter V8 and a 4 speed automatic. It is actually quite a fast car when you consider the amount of weight that it has to move. The car weighs 4400lbs, but manages a 7.2 second 0-60mph time. While this isn�t terribly spectacular, the car isn�t geared for acceleration. It�s geared for the Autobahn. If you really don�t think the car is fast enough, go find a empty freeway, accelerate to 50 or 60mph, then floor it. Make sure that you push the accelerator all the way to the floor to make sure that you hit the transmission kickdown switch. The car will take off like you�ve been rear ended by the space shuttle.

The advantage this has around town is that at 40mph, the engine is only doing around 1300RPMs. It�s under practically no stress, in fact, it�s barely off idle. This means that the engine will last much longer than one that has to do, say 2500RPM to maintain that speed.

It also handles surprisingly well for it�s size. I won�t try to convince you that it�s a Porsche 914. It�s not. But, it handles well enough that to test the limits of it�s capabilities on the street would be both dangerous and stupid.

As for luxury, it has almost anything one could ask for. The amenities include, but are not limited to:
1. Heated, power front and rear seats
2. Power windows and sunroof
3. Power steering & brakes
4. Air Conditioning
5. Vacuum operated power locks (all 4 doors, trunk, gas cap lid)
6. AM/FM/Cassette and/or CD player (depending on year)
Cell Phone

Heck, it�s even got a warning light to tell you when one of your lights (turn signal, taillight, headlight, etc.) is burned out, and one to tell you when the oil level is too low!

The trunk is massive, and the interior easily holds 4 adults with more than ample legroom for a 6� tall person in the front, and another one right behind them. The rear seats have carpeted footrests that look like cheese wedges (the owner may have put them in the trunk, though�)

There are a few things to be aware of, though:
1.	The 560SEL�s 240hp are just about all the transmission can handle. Watch out for someone that�s been drag racing theirs, because the transmission is probably on the way out if it�s been thru much more than 100,000 miles of that kind of abuse.
2.	Make absolutely sure that if the car has over 100,000 miles, that it�s had the timing chain replaced. IF the timing chain should break, it could very well destroy the entire engine.
3.	The factory Becker radio is a bit on the weak side. The sound quality is not exactly stellar (it�s not atrocious, though), so you might want to upgrade that.
4.	Have the car inspected by a good Mercedes mechanic before you buy one. The cars are reliable as can be when they are maintained properly, but they were expensive cars new, and if they aren�t maintained, they�ll be even more expensive to fix.

In short, it�s the best way I can think of to spend $10k.
