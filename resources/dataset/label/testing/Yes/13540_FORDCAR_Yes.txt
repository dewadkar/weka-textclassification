            The 99 Ford Explorer Sport is a FUN, fairly affordable, and safe vehicle.  It is easy to drive and rides very smoothly for a truck based vehicle.  The inside is easy to use and looks nice, complete with fun and handy compartments and buttons.  Because there are so many options, it is very individual and suits personal needs. I bought the car over other SUVs because of its wonderful safety records and have been very impressed with its performance since!  Contrary to belief about 2-door SUVs, the back is very roomy and comfortable. It has everything i need!<br><br>
