            I recently bought the Fuji MX1200.  It was on sale and the price was excellent.  I have been thrilled with the results. The camera is very easy to use. The manual is clear.  The resolution is wonderful.  I have made 8X 10 glossies from the photos I took and they were excellent.  I do not have an expensive printer, so I was surprised how wonderful the glossies came out.  Anyone who wants a camera to send e-mails with or take family photos, vacation photos and make copies will love this camera.  It comes with a 4MB Smart Media Card, and I invested in a 16MB card, which is worth the investment, since the 4MB card only takes a few photos in high resolution.  I have not added any accessories yet, as I have not felt the need to. I find the transfer through the camera cable to computer that it comes with is easy to use, and I have not yet felt the need for a floppy disk adapter.  I leave the cable in my computer all the time, and only have to attach the other end to the camera when I want to transfer photos.  It is an excellent all-around camera, and the price is very good for the resolution and quality.  I thought I would have to spend much more to get these results.  The camera is lightweight, small enough to fit in a pocket.   <br><br>
