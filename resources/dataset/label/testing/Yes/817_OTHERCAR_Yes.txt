            Hello again,
This epinion is about using the Casio QV-11 Digital camera. For the record, I have an extensive background in Photography, and have used many different cameras to get the job done. I also have several Digital cams.
Of them all, the QV-11 gets used the most. Mine is used mostly for product photos of Ebay Auction items. The review 
by &quot;whirrldpeas&quot; dated Aug. 99 is excellent and accurate. In it he covers the specs/features very well. I will concentrate on what it's like to use and what to expect. 
When taking photos for uploading to a website, Size and quality directly affect downloading times. The QV-11 320X240  size is perfect for web auctions. Average image file size is under 20KB. Maybe you've seen those Ebay seller ads with a pair of full size, full color, take fifteen minutes to see fully wonderful beanie-baby photos. With the QV-11 you can upload several photos of your item, (I've run ads with as many as 12 photos that still loaded nicely). The quality is more than good enough for this purpose, and it's image sizes are ideal. With decent light, it will usually get a good picture.(you can adjust exposure and see result instantly) 
Another great feature is the lens portion of the camera rotates. This feature has come in handy more than once. It allows you to hold camera high above your head and over the crowd with the camera's screen toward you and the lens swiveled forward. Sometimes this feature will allow you to get out of the way of the light so there is no shadow. I have taken photos of single coins, gemstones, raw gold, meteorites with lens set to Macro. At the other end of the scale I've taken Real Estate Home photos, Autos, Pianos, Videogames. My daughter made a slide show for her Senior HS Magazine. She was also able to show it &quot;live&quot; straight from the camera with the supplied video cord to school video system. The camera is fairly rugged and has survived both of us using it. It is not a camera for wedding photos, Portraits, Evidence ect. It is basically the modern day electric polariod (sorry Mr.Land). Note: Battery life is shocking! using 4 AA batteries expect about an hour's worth of use. The excellent screen really eats up battery power, so fast compose/shoot is suggested. Better yet get the AC adapter The camera warns you when batteries are low and I have never lost any photos. The AC adapter will come in handy when you're unloading those 96 photos. Hooking up and getting photos out was very easy on Win95 machine. Single cord to your serial port thats it. Software included works well and plays properly with other programs. So if you want to try your hand at the online auctions, or send family photos thru e-mail, inventory you home for insurance, take photos of your ?? collection, the QV-11 will work great for you.<br><br>
