             I purchased a used 2000 model GL at what I believe to be a good price, the car having depreciated 40% from last years listed price. The car was bought from a GM franchise having been a rental and had done 21,000ks (approx 13,500 miles)

 During a long test drive a whine was noticed in 3rd gear. The dealership repaired it under the warranty before I purchased. With nearly 2 yrs left any other warranty claims should get the car in excellent mechanical shape before the warranty expires.

  Having recently undergone replacement hip surgery 8 months ago I was looking for a car that was easy to enter and get comfortable in. I was also ready for quietness, AC, and automatic. Good performance and handling were also qualities I did not want to give up. The electric drivers seat, dual climate control, a 3.5 DOHC engine, ABS and traction control all added up. The remote keyless entry was also a requirement which I appreciate as is the CD /cassette AM/FM stereo.  Items I didn't want and chose not to purchase on an other sample were sunroof, leather and a spoiler.

  The bronze mist paint sparkles in the sunlight but looks drab on cloudy days, I believe that even with running lights people don't pick up the car visually as easily as they did my classic red Miata or even my blue and black motorcycle. I am concerned for winter driving and being seen. Maybe driving a 4 door sedan people don't give you the space that a sports car and motorcycle obtained.

 Fuel efficiency is excellent considering the size, weight and performance. I'm averaging 13 litres per 100k (US 19 mpg) on regular gas around the city with AC on and spirited driving. The AC is very effective but sure is noisy, just the volume of air moved, but also very effective. The fan is loud because everthing else is so quiet. 

  Overall this car is an amazing value with many features and convenience items that are unavailable or very costly in equivalent Japanese or European models. The size is easy to get used to and is not too big, similar to Accords and Camrays. Although Oldsmobile is closing shop, parts should be around for a long time as it shares many components with the Grand Prix, Century, and Impala.  Only the engine is unique and that should last indefinatly, 100ks (60mph) @ 1900rpm and red lined at 6800rpm
