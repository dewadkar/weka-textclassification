            I bought this car to replace a Toyota Cressida that had absolutely no problems. It's a black on black 91 legend the look of these cars are timeless that's why they are so popular and will continue to be. Most people like the 91-95 model better than the current acura's. The power with these v6 is unbelievable at times they are so quick off the line, like 0-60 in 7.6 seconds and 60-80 in less than that.
The 91 body style which was redesigned for that year with mines I've have
more problems than my 87 Toyota Cressida  which I had no problems with.

The car never left me stranded but I did have a few difficulties
my radiator got a leak they say all Honda's do the same thing once the timing belt gets changed, master cylinder which holds your brake fluid started leaking, speed sensor went out all Acura's will go through this as I understand nothing major. but mostly that's it. It's a good car by all means comfortable, roomy, rides smooth, and a very powerful car.

If you really want a legend and you're pressed for the dollars go-ahead
get the 91-92 you'll be ok but if you've got the money go for 93-95 the last year of the legend name, but costly when go for service all of them! <br><br>
