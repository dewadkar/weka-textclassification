            I picked up my 2001 RAV4 on March 19th, 2001 and have been a very happy customer since.  It's been everything I was expecting it to be.  Smooth, quite, easy to drive, awesome handling, stable and drove very solid on the highway with snow and wind.

The minor problems that I have had are as follows:
--Mileage�
I was getting 16 mpg on my first tank, but it�s been improving ever since.

--Transmission�
The transmission is very strange when it�s cold outside (less than 35 degrees).  It won�t sift into 4th gear until the engine has properly warmed up.  I called the dealer, and he�s had the same thing happen to him.  It�s done on purpose to prevent damage to the engine.  Sure the heck scared me the first time it happened though.  At least I know it�s normal.

My buying experience, for a first time car, was an overall 4 out of 5.  The salesman was very helpful and answered all my questions.  The only problem was with the finance person, too pushy with very expensive warranty packages (hello, I�m buying a Toyota!).  Otherwise it was a pleasant experience.  Which really surprised me with some of the rumors I've heard.

The stereo is pretty good, I was driving a junker before so it's a nice change.  The CD player needs a "stop" button.  The climate controls are nicely placed.  Overall the major controls are easy to read and properly placed.

The flexibility of the back seats is awesome.  You can take them out, flip them up against the backs of the front seats, or put the seat backs down.  Nice little storage compartments in the back.
