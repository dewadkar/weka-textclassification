            I dont own this car yet..im still 15. My neighboor has it. It seems quite nice from the exterior, the lights are really powerfull when riding it and they arent much blinding you when you face the car during night. The sound...Best sound i hear for a car, not noisy but step on the gas and hear the rpm rev up and the speed indicator twist to the right, I dont know whats this cars top speed, my neighboor started speeding on a small road, she reached 180 in a blast, withtout even pressing much on the gaz, its only a 3.2L but its built for performance, incredible. As i was saying, she reached 180 and got scared and slowed down. Its a really nice car from the interior too, quite comfy and all kind of adjustements for everything. I dont know how solid it is, didnt had time to crash it yet.
