            I purchased my 1999 Dodge Avenger in February of this year.  I turned my 1997 Toyota Camry back in the the dealer when my lease was up and wanted to get something a little sportier.  

My car had 80 miles on it (this was a major attraction).  It's gold in color and has tan/black leather interior.  CD player, power sun roof, premium stereo system.  It's awesome.

It handles very well and gets decent gas mileage.  Before I started my new job, I could go almost 2 weeks on a tank of gas.  But now that I have further to go, I can usually make one tank last a week.

The dealership was looking to get the car off the lot since it was a 1999 model.  They were losing money on it just sitting there, so I got it for a song.  They are reasonably price..mine was right at $17k.

The only real problem we've had is that it leaks a tar-like substance from under the door on to the running boards.  It's been in the shop a couple of times for this problem.

I wouldn't recommend it to people who have small children and have to use a car seat.  Or for larger families.  It's perfect for me and my husband to cruise around in.<br><br>
