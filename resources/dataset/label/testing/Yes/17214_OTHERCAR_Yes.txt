            I've had the OPTIO 33L for about a year now and overall, it is a good camera.  I feel it is an excellent "starter" camera for someone who has never owned a digital camera before. 
It is fairly easy to use and the special features are fairly self-explanatory.  It is easy to delete unwanted pictures immediately.
I use this camera for family stuff - pictures at holidays, special events, etc.  I have a 10m3w old son and I've whipped out the camera to catch those fun firsts - first steps, first crawl, etc.  It warms up pretty quickly and takes good pictures - even on the go.
The only real negatives are that if you don't push the button hard enough, the camera freezes and you have to "hard" reboot it by removing the batteries.  It also starts out on  default with "always flash" on, which makes the battery wear out faster.
The card holds quite a few pictures - even at higher resolution.  The whole camera is pretty easy to attach to your computer and DL'ing pictures from it is a snap!  It comes with the ACD software, which makes editing pictures very simple even for a newbie.  I always edit my pictures, to cut out red eye, to brighten or darken - whatever they need and even if they don't, because the pictures at always HUGE files until you edit them and save them as jpg files.  Again, the software pretty much does it all for you.
