        I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.
       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision.  

   The Saab line of vehicles has been around for a good long time. I have seen quite a few of them from underneath with over <b>a quarter of a million miles </b> on them, and they hold up very well. The suspensions on these Swedish vehicles, though nothing to brag about, are constructed very well. They are simply an SLA front suspension ( two control arms ), with coil springs and rack and pinion steering. With the damping done with a simple shock absorber. The rear suspension is a straight axle, with again, coil springs and simple shock absorbers.

     You aren't going to find on most models any four wheel independent suspensions or no fancy configuration of high tech steering linkage or suspension components. What you will see, though, is <b>a near bulletproof simple design</b>. Well laid out and built with very high quality metal throughout. And requires little or no maintenance, while lasting a good long time. This goes for almost all of the Saab models, as they are almost all dseigned with the same front end configuration. 

   I have seldom seen any need in these for low mileage front end re-builds as a result of poor quality, as the steering and suspension components have obviously been constructed with some of the best designed metals in the industry. These cars seem to want to go on forever. Neither the ball joints, nor the outer tie rod ends are factory greasable, attesting to the fact of high quality OEM parts. Oh I have replaced a few outer tie rod ends on these, and the occasional set of shock bushings, but this seems like the exception rather than the norm.

   There is a real love for the Saab vehicles in the area where I live, and I have had ample opportunities to do alignments on these vehicles. I would highly recommend that if you are looking at a possible purchase of a used Saab, not to worry at all about the steering and suspensions, they will go the extra mile for you.

  Weigh out all the other aspects of a Saab against everything else you are looking at, check the front ends of those against the long lasting and near maintenance free Saab models, and decide for yourself. You won't find many more cars like the Saab in longevity front end wise.

  One thing I have found on Saab's though. If you upsize the tires on these vehicles, and I have come across a few which have, they handle very erratically on snow and ice. I, for the life of me don't know why, but they do. My boss had a Saab 9000 and put one size bigger tires on it, and it swayed all over the road. After I aligned it perfectly, it was still the same. Then we changed the tires to the size it came with, and it went perfectly straight. No reasonable explanation can be found, so when you do purchase that new or used Saab, stick with the tire size it came with.<br><br>
