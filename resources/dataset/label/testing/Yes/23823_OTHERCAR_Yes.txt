            I myself like this car as a whole, there are a few things that I wish were better so we'll start with those first.  Being that the car is so small and light it really does not handle the wind very well on the interstates, which in turn drops your MPG down to where the average car would be at.  It's lack of power is kind of a hinderance in that area as well, if you get a few pieces of luggage in that trunk it will be less productive.  It does feel a little hallow, or kind of like a shell, there really doesn't seem like there is a lot to it.  I myself can't stand the sun visors, I know that it may sound wierd but they are kind of spring loaded, so you can really only have it in one place.  Toyota was pretty cheap on their options package, you have to pay too much to get not much.  If they would have made more things standard for the same price, they probably would've sold more.  I really don't like not having cruise. Maintenence is pretty simple on it, the jack and spare are really easy to get to, and the oil is pretty easy to change.  I myself like the gagues where they are at, I always hated trying to look around my steering wheel to check my speed and such, I do wish that there was a tachometer, and actual gauges, I am not a fan of idiot lights.  I like the head room there is also plenty of room for two adults comfortably to sit in back.  The sound system is fine.  I love all of the nicks and crannies, lots of little storage space.  It has nice little acceleration, when trying to pass, it loses it kind of quick, but it is pretty good when trying to get around someone.  I love the fact that I can park in really small spots.  I for one have no trouble with the view out the rear window, but I understand why it would be a problem, the trunk sits pretty high, and so you are left with a good guess as to where your bumper is.
