            Airbags work.  Seatbelts work.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  When I was involved in a head on collision last spring I am confident that my 1992 Celica's safety equipment and the quality of the car itself saved me from any injury.  Aside from a sore chest from the strained seatbelt, I had no cuts or bruises and no other, perhaps dormant, injuries.

All I wanted to do was go to the store to get a fish aquarium.  I almost made it. I drove up to the four-way intersection, signaling for a left-hand turn. I didn't see a van coming downhill from the opposite direction.  I had no idea they were there.  Perhaps they were speeding, maybe they didn't have their headlights onï¿½ it doesn't matter.  I only saw a flash of grill and heard a terrible crash as my car was stopped and violently thrown backwards from the impact.  

When my car had come to rest all I could see was the airbag .  As it slowly deflated I could see the twisted metal from the minivan and what had been the front of my car.  I looked around dumbly, in shock from the quickness and violence of the crash.  It took a moment for me to see the other driver standing next to my car asking me if I was OK.  Yes, I was.  More importantly, she was.  

Both cars were steaming.  The smell of twisted metal and burnt rubber and oil was nauseating.  My radio was blaring white noise as if it were possessed.  I got out of my car.  

It was rush hour.  I was painfully aware of the onlookers at the busy intersection.  I was also painfully aware of the three children in the woman's minivan.  They were all OK, scared and crying, but safe.  Fortunately for them, my car had taken nearly the full extent of the impact.  I would gladly sacrifice myself, as we all would, in the best interest of the children.

The other driver was understanding.  Her kindness and caring, even though the accident was legitimately my fault, made the situation endurable.  Stepping back, I looked at my car.

I loved my car.  A midnight blue Celica, I had owned it for nearly a year.  The car fit the standard of Toyota quality; it had gone nearly twenty thousand miles with me. It had gone over 120 thousand miles and still showed no signs of wear.  No mechanical problems, smooth ride and comfortable.  More importantly, I had just survived a head on collision thanks to the quality of the safety features in the car.

I had never before realized the trauma of a collision.  What bothered me most was I didn't see it coming.  But, I credit the quality of the Toyota Celica with my safety.  Now I drive another car, but if I could get the Celica again, I would.  

Please wear your seatbelt.
