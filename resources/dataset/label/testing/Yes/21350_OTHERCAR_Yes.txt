            I bought a Corolla in 1995.  It was a serviceable vehicle, but without much power or excitement.  What I really wanted to buy was a Camry but my funds were low.

In 1999, I found myself with some cash and decided to upgrade my vehicle. I thought about an Acura or a low-end Lexus.  But after reading about these vehicles, the general advice was to buy a fully loaded Camry instead.

So, I did.  A Camry V6, XLE, fully loaded.  All I can tell you is that is the best car I've ever owned.  Everyone in my family fits comfortably. The leather seats are wonderful, heated side mirrors, moon-roof, 6 speaker stereo, I could go on and on.

I absolutely love my car. I suppose that if I was forced to criticize the car, it might be the suspension when I'm making a wild turn.  I can see why it is one of the most popular cars in America.  It lives up to its reputation. <br><br>
