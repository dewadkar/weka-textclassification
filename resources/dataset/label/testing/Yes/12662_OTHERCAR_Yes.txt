            Well, it was given to me as a surprise gift from my husband. If this is a Jag aimed at younger people, then it worked since we are both 32 (at least, we think we are young).

I've only had it for three days, but so far, it has driven like a dream. It accelerates very smoothly and handles beautifully. The interior is very well-appointed, and contrary to what one of the reviewers wrote, it did come with a CD-changer standard (I have the 4.0). The sound system is actually pretty good, playing both rock and classical music nicely.

The trunk is pretty big for the kind of car it is. It's not going to carry all the stuff my GM Jimmy did, but hey if I wanted cargo space, we should have gotten something else. It holds my double stroller though, and I think it will hold all the stuff we will need for a family weekend (I've got two kids, a toddler and an infant).

Speaking of family, the back seat holds our two car seats (Evenflo On My Way and Evenflo Medallion V XL) very snugly. The car actually has the new LATCH system too.

If you are looking for great handling luxury car at a somewhat affordable price (I guess I'm comparing it to a Porsche), then this is it. 

Oh, and you get a lot of stares from fellow drivers and assorted pedestrians. That is pretty cool too!


UPDATE:

So, I've had the car for a little over a month now, and I still love it. It's nice (and safe) to be able to accelerate quickly when entering the freeway. 

We've had a little annoying rattle coming from one of the A/C vents. We took the car to the dealer twice, and they finally fixed it.

We've since upgraded son #2 to a rear-facing convertible seat (from infant seat). It's made me painfully aware that the backseat is not as big as I thought it was. With the car seat reclined (passenger side, outboard), the front passenger barely has adequate legroom (I'm 5' 8", and I could use a little more space, but I'm OK. My husband is 6' 2", and he would need more space).

I've had the (not so great) opportunity to hit the brakes on a somewhat quick stop, and they worked great. I also took this chance to honk at the "nice" person who was swerving into my lane, and I could barely hear it inside the Jag. The "nice" person though, heard it loud and clear, and got out of my way. The car rides so quietly. Oh, and by the way, the A/C cools the car off rather quickly (now that Texas summer has started).

Other than that, two little things are kind of bugging me. First, the wheels get dirty so quickly, I guess from the brakes. And secondly, the windshield wipers don't retract fully out of sight. They just sit half in, half out. One can see it when the wiper is not operational. I'd think that in a nice car like this one, they would get the wipers to be out sight when not in use. Boo hoo.

Anyway, not exactly big complaints. Just thought you might want to know...

UPDATE (May 2003)

Well, the car continues to squeak. I thought it had been fixed,  but alas, the squeaking came back. It squeaks mostly in warmer weather (oddly enough, I always assumed that with all the parts expanding, the car would be tighter, but not with this one).

We have since moved to Philadelphia, and last winter was rough here. Lots of snow, ice, sleet, and rain. Unfortunately, the S-type is not great under these conditions. One would think that an English car would handle well in the winter, since the English winter is so miserable. Oh well. I got in many slippery situations. But I can safely say that the ABS brakes are fully functional! :)

My oldest child is now in a booster seat (Britax Starriser/Comfy), and we have a little more space between the car seats. My youngest is in a Britax Freeway. The middle space still won't sit an adult comfortably. But it will hold another booster seat.

We took one long trip (over a week, and over 700 miles) and almost all the stuff we needed as a family of four fit in the car (we did not bring a folding playpen/crib, or stroller). It was a bit crowded in the cabin area, and the trunk was packed to the top. The kids had stuff between their car seats (crayons, toys, etc), by their feet (snacks, water), and the passenger side footroom was non-existent since we needed that area also (story tapes for the kids, changes of clothing, maps).

Overall, the car continues to handle very nicely. We haven't had to take it in for anything other than the scheduled maintenances. It continues to look very stylish (although I did get my first door ding the other day). And it's kind of nice when I'm the only mom in the carpool line with a cool car! :)
