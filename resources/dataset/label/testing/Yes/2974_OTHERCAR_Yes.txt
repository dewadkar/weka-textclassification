            Let's begin with what comes out of the box:
The 4MP Kodak LS443 Camera with built-in 16MB memory.
A docking station.
A battery.
AC Adapter.
USB Cable.

Let me begin by saying, thanks Kodak for not making us spend 100 extra dollars on things like the AC adapter and batteries which should be included in the first place.

This is my opinion on the camera. 
I love it for it's picture quality but I dislike it for not making me feel so great about myself when I take a picture. What does this mean?

Well, when you see most cameras, the LCD is so crisp you can see if you goofed up the picture when you took it.  Therefore, you can quickly erase it and take another snapshot. 

With the LS443, you take a picture and the display on the screen isn't always all that great so you can't tell if it will be blurry or if there is too much light. Keep this in mind when purchasing the camera. Luckily, the picture quality is so top-notch with this camera, I was able to foresee the lack of LCD display.

As far as the lens is concerned, it is a high-end propriety Schneider-Kreuznach Variogon lens.  

There is a 3x optical zoom and 3.3x digital zoom for a total 10x zoom.  
In case you don't know how the zooms work, this is the difference:
Optical zoom is a lens change causing a picture to be snapshotted as if you were physically closer to the object you are capturing.  This means that the picture is AS GOOD quality as it would be if you were physically near the camera itself.
Digital zoom is a hardware/software approach to "zooming" in on a particular object at a certain distance.  This type of zoom causes pixelation and destroys the overall quality of the picture. I don't even bother using digital zoom. I have it turned off. 

If you are looking to get a camera with great quality and zoom, only look at optical zoom, not digital.  If you do look at digital, make sure that the camera is of high megapixels because you will need them when digitally zooming in.

The autofocus on the camera is great.  You hold the button down half-way and a little green box on the camera's LCD turns red.  This means that the camera is focused and you can depress the button all the way to snapshot the picture.  Immediately after that the image is displayed on the screen and you are ready for your next shot.

Fortunately, Kodak took a huge step is combining the Picture Mode with the Review mode.  This means that you can hit the review button at any time in picture mode and it will show you all the pictures stored on the memory card.  This helps a lot so you don't have to physically turn the camera into a different mode every time you want to review a picture.  There is also an independent Delete and Share button available.  That way you can immediately delete a picture if you don't like it. Or you can hit the share button, which will allow you flag the picture to be emailed to a previously set list (via computer software) of possible recipients.  As soon as you dock the camera, it will prompt you to email out the pictures you have flagged.

As far as the modes are concerned on the camera, it contains the following:

Movie Mode: (this is with sound and it also plays back sound.) The quality is not so great but you can't expect much from a digital camera.  Also, you don't have the ability to zoom in and out during recording since it will make noise and be captured.

Auto Mode: This mode is great for everyday pictures of people, objects at a reasonable distance.  It takes the best picture dependent on the current situation. The autofocus is performed by an independent blue light which shines prior to the snapshot and focuses the camera.

Sport Mode: This is ideal for objects in motion and will increase the shutter speed thus trying to avoid blurriness.

Macro Mode: This is for objects that are closer than 28cm. Flash is automatically disabled and this option works great. I've used it many times. 

Night Time Mode: This is great for night time when light is readily available. The shutter speed is decreased and hence more light is absorbed. However, this means that even a slight shake in your hand will output a blurry image.  Thus you need some sort of tripod when taking these types of pictures.

Landscape Mode: This sets the lens to infinite focus.  There is no redbox/greenbox to indicate focus.  This mode works fantastic and I've used it many times to take great pictures of scenery.

As far as the options are concerned on the camera itself, you have the ability to set it to multiple mode which will take up to 3 shots in a row.  Works great for objects in motion. 
You also have the ability to change the flash type to automatic, always-on, red-eye reduction or off.  Red-eye reduction is a little weird since it flashes twice instead of flickering first and then flashing. This means your guests will assume that the picture was taken on the first flash and start to move right at the time the actual picture is taken. Be careful of this and warn them ahead of time!
The pictures can be taken in color, black and white, or sephia (the olden days look)
There is control to increase or decrease white exposure (for snowy days or days there is too much or too little light)
There is the ability to set the quality of the picture. You can make it the full 4 Megapixels, 2.2 Megapixels or, 1 Megapixel. With a 128MB card, you can take 103 pictures at best quality.

As far as the cards are concerned, this camera uses a Secure Digital / MultiMedia card.  These are generally much more expensive than compact flash or smart media.  However, it has 16MB of internal memory which is used once the card is filled.  

The camera comes with a docking station.  When you place the camera on the docking station, it begins to charge and immediately allows you to transfer over pictures to your computer.  Charging time is about 2 hours which is much better than the Sony DSC-P71 which requires 13 hours! 

An excellent feature of the camera is that you can physically connect the same AC adapter and same USB that goes into the docking station, right into the side of the camera.  This means you can transfer pics to any computer without carrying around the entire docking station.  However, take note that the AC adapter, when plugged directly into the camera, will not charge it but will let you take infinite amount of pictures without a battery.

No matter where you, you will find the AC adapter costs much more and the battery charger is a standalone device.  Kodak simplifies our life by including all this in the package.

Drawbacks of this camera also include the fact that there is no way to check the battery life unless it's dying in which a battery indicator comes on the LCD.  Usually you can take about 75 pictures WITH the LCD on and upto 300 pictures with the LCD off. Be prepared to buy an extra battery. These batteries are proprietary and can only be bought in select places. Luckily they are dirt cheap. You can get a battery   additional wall charger(great for travel) for about 25 dollars if you look around online. 

One other thing that I would love to have seen would have been an additional text LCD display which showed number of pics remaining, battery indicator and few other required options. This way you wouldn't have to have the LCD on most of the time.  

However, for the price, you can't expect to have everything.
I chose this camera because I wanted the quality of the pics to be great, not for just the features. What you are looking for is up to you. 

Good luck with buying a digicam and I hope you are as satisfied as I was with my purchase.
