            I have been driving a 2000 Dodge Dakota for about four months.  I find it handles extremely well and is very comfortable to ride in.  I opted for the club cab to accommodate my twin 4-year-old boys.  The car seats fit nicely.  The six cylinder engine provides more than enough power and &quot;pick-up&quot; when needed, while it drives more like a car than a pick up.  The only problem I've had with it is the driver side power window sticks sometimes.

If you have a family, the club cab is for you.  The Dakota gives the look and feel of the Ram, but costs considerably less.<br><br>
