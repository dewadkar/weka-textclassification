            This camera was my Christmas present from my husband.  I have been an amateur photographer since college and own three 35mm cameras and many lens, a video camera and also collect vintage cameras.  I picked this camera after researching digital cameras from all sources, web, friends, magazines, etc.  What really sold me on this camera was the cover for the lcd screen/display.  Research told me that this was the first item to be damaged on digital cameras and that even with careful use, you could render your camera useless if the screen is damaged.  The screen flips up or down allowing for some interesting shots without becoming a contortionist.  The screen is bright and large enough to view photos reasonably.  And the photos are great.  I have enlarged photos to 8 x 10 on the highest resolution with very good results.  My in-laws, who also own a digital camera, commented after receiving pics emailed to them, "what camera did you buy! they look fabulous, much better than the camera we own".  The camera does not have a view finder, which does take a little while to adjust to if you are used to SLR or instamatics.  After you adjust, you will enjoy taking more and more pictures.  The menu function allows you to delete those bad shots.  Other features and black and white and sepia tones.  Another feature that I wanted was an optical zoom.  Most digitals have a digital zoom, but the optical zoom allows more control to bring the photos up close.  To review the photos you just took, it has a slide show option.  The software that Sony packages with the camera is moderate, I have upgraded my software package to allow for more control and options.  There are more options on this camera that I am still learning. The only disappointment is the 4mb memory stick, you can only get 4 or 5 photos at the highest resolution on this card, an upgrade is a must.
