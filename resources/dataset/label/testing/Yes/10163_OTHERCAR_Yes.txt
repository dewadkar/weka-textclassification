            We were looking for a good used car, and we got so much more!  The salesperson brought our cranky son a snack at the dealership, drove the car to our house after we had brought it in for a problem 1 day after we bought it (which was, by the way, fixed for free), and brought us a needed locking clip for our car seat on _CHRISTMAS EVE DAY_, after going to a different car dealership altogether to pick it up.

Not to mention the fact that the car is running fine--we;ve had it for a year and seven months. :)  We've only had to make one repair (last summer), and it cost less than $250.  It does have a lot of miles on it, and the metal timing chain does make the engine louder than what we're used to ( a Toyota Corolla ), but it has been a WONDERFUL car for me and my two small children.  Saturn provided the tether bolt (for the car seat) and installed it free-of-charge.  Plus, we get free car washes whenever we like.

I have been so satisfied with the whole experience!
