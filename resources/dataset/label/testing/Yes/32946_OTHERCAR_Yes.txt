            I went to the dealership looking at Nissans' and Toyota's - I drove out with a silver 1993 Audi 90S with 50,000 miles. It's over 110,000 miles later and the car drives better than most new cars I have drove. Unlike any other car I have owned - this car gives me a solid no nonsense feel of the road.  Braking, cornering, passing, this car has what it takes to get the job done with an assured confidence.  Floor it at 70 mph to pass another vehicle and the motor shifts into a lower gear to provide the passing power.  It's a dream on the highway, heated seats fully adjustable- solid feel and ride. However all this doesnï¿½t come without a price - you can expect to pay higher dollars in parts and service.  Example; A cracked lens on one headlight requires replacement of the entire unit at 350.00 a pop, one fog light 150.00.  Overall I have replaced all the brake pads, 2 rotors, radiator, and a timing belt. If I decided sell this car today for trade in value, I would have paid about 24 cents a mile (Maintenance and cost of vehicle) All in all I'm OK with that, but I think I will drive it another 100,000.
