                <b>S</b>urprising just about all Dodge fans, Dodge dropped its super potent 224 horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine into the almost invisible little Spirit sedan. The result; The Spirit R/T. This sedan could outperform 'nearly' every sports car under $30,000 in the early 1990s, and  outperformed the long lasting sports sedan champ; the Taurus SHO. The only problem with this sedan was that it was produced in limited numbers.


<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

     <b>L</b>ike the exterior, there is very little inside to distinguish the R/T from the basic Spirit commuter sedan. You only know the difference really when you drive it! The 2.2 liter 4-cylinder is an absolute jem. Smooth and vibration-free for its size, and couples to a 5-speed manual transmission. This car produces extremely rapid acceleration for a sedan, and for any car made in the early 1990s for that matter. 0-60 mph takes just a tad under 6 seconds (according to specs) meaning it's faster than the Taurus SHO which has a 220 horse powered V6, and almost as fast as cars like the Mustang LX 5.0 5-speed for this year. In-fact, a 1991 5-speed Spirit R/T is faster 0-60 than a 1991 Mustang GT matched with an automatic transmission. But with 224 horsepower going through the front wheels, torque steer can take the inexperienced driver, or even an enthusiast completely by surprise. This torque steer can be annoying, but all in all this is a very fun car to drive. 

     What really makes the R/T a champ is its engine. It was based on a proven 2.2 liter 4-cylinder that had been around in various forms since 1982, and was fitted to the overtly Omni and charger GLH-S. The Spirit motor features cast iron block and an alloy head, which has twin belt driven, overhead camshafts and four valves for each cylinder. Twin rotating balancer shafts in the motor reduce vibration ( a trademark problem of Mopar small displacement four cylinders) and a Garett T3 turbocharger, with an intercooler, help to produce as much power as legally possible. In this case a more than respectable 224hp @ 6,000 rpm. This is only 1 horse power shy of the famous 5.0 liter that is found in the GT and LX mustangs, not to mention the Lincoln mark VII.

         <b>The Spirit</b> owes much of its success to its K-car predecessor; the Aires. They both  have a unitary chassis, Macpherson-strut front <b>suspension</b>, and a beam axle on semi-trailing arms at the rear. For the R/T, Dodge engineers stiffened up the standard Spirit springs, and added bigger anti-roll bars and 15" wheels and big tires. All R/T's have standard four-wheel disc brakes, and ABS was offered as an option. Even so, handling was one of the cars less redeeming features.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

   The <b>interior</b> of the Spirit R/T, to be blunt, is very cheap looking. There is tons of fake wood. I thought my 1989 Mercury Sable was bad, but this car takes the cake! The entire dashboard is almost of plastic looking simulated wood. The steering wheel doesn't quite fit right, a more aggressive, thicker steering wheel would have been welcomed. The regular Spirits came with bench seats, but the R/T came equipped with buckets with a center console. The bucket seats are supportive, but not very comfortable after an hour, and have a tacky red stripe design theme going, they also could use some more bolstering for aggressive driving. The stock sound system is not up to par, I'm guessing it was in the 60 watt range. On a positive note, there is enough room all around, and the rear seats fold foreword to extend the luggage area.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i>

    The <b>exterior</b> looks like a car we all know. When yours kids draw a picture of a car, it kinda looks like this. At least when I was a kid this is how my drawings looked, exactly like a Dodge Spirit; boxy and plain. This car is an ultimate sleeper. This car looks slow even if its going 100 MPH. The last thing you expect to see is a car like this burning rubber at a stop light. The R/T does come with flush mounted headlights, and foglights which add some style. They also come with original snowflake-like styled wheels.

     The R/T is very hard to come by, only around 1,300 units were put into production. For a regular 1991 Spirit you can expect to pay around $3,200 bucks, but an R/T will set you back much more, in-fact these are so collectible among DSM fans that I have never seen one for sale.
