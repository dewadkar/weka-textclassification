            I previously owned an Olympus 2020 and was very happy with that product.  If it wasn't stolen on my Honeymoon in the UK (June 2000), I would still be using it.  Since the camera was stolen, we needed a replacement and purchased the 3030 while in London.  I was not disappointed.  We ended up buying another one in Scotland after dropping the first and cracking the lens shroud.
The camera is probably not for beginners, because it has a number of features available, including being able to select between 3 ASA values (100, 200 and 400) and 5 different flash settings.  You can even record a Quicktime movie with sound!  The zoom is 3x with an additional 2.5x electronic zoom.
Improvements over the 2020, include a rotary dial to turn the camera on and select modes instead of a button that was often confused with the shutter button on the 2020 and more features to go with almost doubling of pixels from 2 million to 3.34 million.
You can read all the technical details in the descriptions and other reviews, I wanted to tell you about the way the camera takes pictures.
The camera is extremely compact and easy to carry.  Additional memory cards, up to 32 MB, are available and highly recommended.  With a 32 MB card you can take approximately 40 pictures in jpg format at the highest resolution.  At lower resolutions the number of pictures possible increases dramatically.  At the highest resolution, the quality of the pictures is excellent.  While still not quite the level of SLR or some other formats, the vast majority of users will be very satisfied.
The special lithium batteries that come with the camera are extremely long-lived, but they are not rechargable.  I am still using the set that came with my camera and have taken well over 400 pictures, of course using the flash a lot would reduce the number of shots that you can take.
If I could change one thing, it would be to have interchangeable lenses like SLR cameras.
If you are uncomfortable with technology, this camera may not be for you.  Ease of use dramatically improves with some experience.  If you are looking for high resolution pictures, a compact size and more features than you can shake a stick at, this camera is for you.  If you want point and shoot, this camera can do it, but you will be wasting a lot of its features.<br><br>
