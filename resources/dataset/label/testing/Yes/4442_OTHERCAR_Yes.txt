            I fell in love with the car, but I am committed to Acura because the level of service, it is amazing.  First if you are:
� A busy person
� Enjoy performance
� Expect the best
� Expect courteous service
 I would strongly recommend the Acura CL 3.0. 

I will describe the car and the service that I receive &amp; love.

The cars power &amp; ride
The power and sophistication is not matched in its class.  This is a fun car to drive in the city or on a road trip.  I have become so spoiled by the quite/smooth ride &amp; love the power when you stomp on the gas.  I never thought I would like an automatic car, this is a smooth shifting dream.  

When you want to be a little sportier you simply put it in D3 and it winds you out to the red line.  You will really enjoy every ounce of the 200hp V-Tec engine; you can feel the V-Tec kick in.  It is a rocket, the steering is not a true sport coupe but I still love it.   There is feeling the road and then there is enjoying the ride.  Once you drive it you will understand.

Look &amp; features
I really like the sleek styling of the car, it is distinctive (I would get the spoiler I like mine.)  The fit and finish are timeless and age very well.  People still ask me if it is a new car it is now three years old.  I can not count all of the compliments that I have gotten.  When was the last time a valet complimented you on you car?  Last Saturday for my car thank you.  It has so many features that appeal to me:
� Heated seats
� Leather 
� Great sound system
� Remote trunk entry (you can't use the key, why would you want to?)
� Mine has the optional spoiler &amp; cassette player
� The list goes on and on

The dealership &amp; service
I have the luck of being located near the second highest rated Acura dealership for sales and service in the country.  It is located in Naperville IL. Your local dealership may vary.

Sales
I never thought that I would rave about a sales person at an auto dealership but I had a great experience.  Purchasing the car was painless; the sales person answered my questions and made me feel very comfortable. He then explained all of the features and outlined everything that is in the manual.  Their attitude is that you are a busy person that does not have the time to read the manual.

My dealership has:
� A newsletter with info about Acura and service discounts
� A yearly customer appreciation party (catered of course)
� Sends out special invitations to the Chicago auto show, they host a cocktail party and you also get in the show at no charge
� Amazing service

Service
The service is the best I have ever experienced.  I am the type of person that walks in and says things like &quot;it making a clicking sound from around that area.&quot;  They always explain what they think it is and are very thoughtful and helpful.  It is really affordable $34 for an oil change if you did not happen to get a discount, $150 to change oil and rotate the tires and major look-over.  At my dealership the technician actually creates an audiocassette.  As you drive home they describe the work done and how everything looked.  

The only other item I have had to do was change the brakes.  I was amazed the estimate was for $650, It did not require as much work as they expected it was $450 for all four tires.  I have never had a service department charge less than the estimate.

All major services:
� Wash the car
� Give a loaner (plan ahead)
� A picture and the signature of the person that worked on your car (Their signature is a sign of the commitment to excellence.)
� The tape describing work done

The only things I do not like about my Acura CL are the features it does not have.  Luckily they are all incorporated into the new 2000-CL.  Dual temperature heated seats, GPS system, built in garage door opener, and who knew you needed outside mirrors that tilt down when you go into reverse?  (That is so you can see if something is behind you.)  I need that now!

If you are saying to yourself, &quot;man you must pay for services like that&quot; this is not the car for you.  

If you understand the appeal of being pampered you can not go wrong with and Acura CL of any year.  Make sure you can get similar service from your dealership!
