                 A beautiful car! It is one of the most handsome and luxurious cars on the market today. If your looking for major features, a handsome and dignified car, and a moderate price tag, this is the one for you! I will do a run over on all the features. Also, this is NOTHING like the Camry, I have one and I like it as well, but, well this has the same reliability of the Camry, (I drove mine 180,000 without ever having to do anything but some oil changes, filling it with gas, and a hub cap!) These are all comments about my 1997 model.

     Service: Great! They take your car in, clean it, and give you a brand new rental ES 300 with all the features while they repair it. After they repair it, they clean it, and in my case they even waxed it, talk about luxury! And I didn't have to pay anything.(This is my dealership, I don't know about others that well but I believe they are just as good!) They gave my car this check up in one day and the next day they returned it. (To tell you the truth, I would have been just as happy going around in that 2000 model for another week or so!)

     Features: My ES 300 has All leather seating, heated front seats, front and rear cup holders, a 6 disk CD changer mounted in the glove compartment, but still leaving plenty of space for my other glove compartment accessories!, Power driver and passenger seat's w/8 way controls. (Drivers seat has power lumbar support) Power windows and locks (drivers seat has one touch up/down [1999+has both driver and passenger seat one touch up/down w/pinch protection]), auto climate control, outside thermometer, a 7 speaker audio system w/ 18 radio station presets, cassette and CD pickup where it last was, lighted vanity mirrors, power mirrors. Remote to open trunk, lock/ulock doors, PANIC. These are only the ones I could think about, there are definitely more!

     Security: A security system that is set only with the remote or if you lock all doors and the trunk while a door is open. If a door is forced open or opened while in this mode, it locks all doors instantly and keeps them locked, sounds a loud intermittent horn, and disables the starting ignitor. This can be ended if you use the remote or key to open the doors. To take this car off security, just unlock it with either the key or remote. If a person is inside the car with the doors and trunks closed, this person can lock all doors without<br><br>
