            Figured I would do a review on our beloved Merc before we sell it off in order to get something a lot smaller, and more affordable.

I'm not quite sure if I'm in the right category for it, but the model we have is a 1988 Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL. Sounds like an S-Class to me, although it is definitely not a sports car, as Epinions has listed here. On the contrary, it is a huge 4 door sedan.

Onto the review then.

<i>Engine-Transmission</i>

As you would expect from the name of the car, this engine is a 4.2 litre V-8. It's a huge motor, and manages to fill up all of the underhood space. It runs incredibly quiet, even at highway speeds (120 km/h), and around town, you'd think the car wasn't running if it wasn't for the rpm gauge provided. It's very torquey, and you rarely need to raise rpm's over 2000 around town, so even though it's a big 8, you still get decent gas mileage here. Another thing to point out is that the throttle is very quick upon pushing the accelerator. Meaning that a slight touch will cause the car to jump ahead, and maybe even chirp the tires. There's a lot of power here (201 hp and 228 lbs/feet torque), so a light touch is needed, especially when you first drive the car.

The transmission is smooth shifting, and works invisibly, as you'd expect in a luxury car. You really need to tip into the accelerator to get this to downshift, although it's not really a problem for passing, since the engine has enough power to give you the push you normally need from any gear. The lever has the traditional notched pattern that all MB's are known for, and we've never had a problem with our tranny, so I'd say that the quality is there.

In conclusion, a fitting powerplant combo for a car of this size and type.

<i>Styling</i>

If you've seen one Benz, you've seen them all. That's always been a motto of mine. It's got the distinctive MB look to it, with the star up front, and the star behind, and it's more boxy than the new ones on the street today, but in general, this car exudes class. You feel and look like a million bucks when you drive this. 

<i>Interior</i>

I've been pampered by our J30(see my other reviews!), so I need to keep in mind that this is an older car, and that a lot of the luxury items we take for granted today just weren't available then.

However, this car doesn't really let down, even when compared to the standards of today. The inside of this car is HUGE. I can't overstate this. There is ample room in the front, but it's the back that's amazing. You have room for 3 abreast, and I swear, there's enough leg room to get a couple of people to sit at your feet. I'm 6'2, and I've got a full foot between my knees and the front seatback when I sit in the rear. Amazing. 

Everything is leather of course, and if I have one slight beef, it's the seats. Unlike newer MB's, these are very soft and springy. They offer little support, and are basically just big sofas. I guess the people at MB didn't see this as a sporting car of any sort.

The dash and control panel is set up in standard MB fashion, with wood trim everywhere, and a certain starkness to everything. By that I mean, it's luxurious, but everything looks like it was made to perform well and last long, rather than bathe you in luxury. 

It has climate control, cruise, and basically everything you'd expect from a luxury car, including heated seats and a sunroof(not glass unfortunately). We've had some problems with the sunroof not closing properly, but that ended up being just a seal that needed replacement.

The stereo can't keep up with any luxury cars sold today, but it's still a decent unit. The system has 4 high quality speakers, and everything is digital. Meaning a lot of buttons. Meaning me tearing my hair out when I simply want to turn the volume up. I hate buttons on radio's. The sound is good, but it's a huge pain to do simple things, so I have to give this a thumbs down. I'd suggest switching it with something newer.

The trunk as you'd expect, is enormous. There's no passthrough, but it looks like you could fit skis in there lengthwise if you wanted. We've dumped over 10 golf bags in there once, just to give you an idea of how big it is.

Oh, and one last note- you also get a driver's side airbag.

<i>Handling-Braking</i>

The model we had also included ABS. I'm too young to remember if this was a feature many cars had in 1988, but my dad says it wasn't that common. The braking on this car is awesome. It looks like the engineers at MB overcompensated here, and gave brakes that would work on a car twice the 420 SEL's size. I'm not complaining. They stop you quickly, with little fade. I do notice the ABS working, and pushing back on hard stops though, something that I never feel on our other cars. Just pointing it out so it doesn't worry any potential buyers.

The handling on this car is what you'd expect from a behemoth of this size. It leans a lot, and doesn't really take to being thrown into corners all too well. This is a luxury car in the classic sense, and likes to be driven fast in straight lines. 

That being said, at more normal speeds, it does a superb job of shock absorption while still giving a nice feel for the road. If you push it though, you're asking for trouble, and the seats don't help matters out, as you're sliding all over the place.

<i>Other Stuff</i>

This car takes a lot gas. Meaning it costs $50 Canadian to fill up here. And premium no less. I don't know if that's required, but we've always used the good stuff. It's not the best car in the world for gas consumption, but it is pretty good for the size and engine type.

We've had next to no problems with this car. A couple of years ago, we repainted, strictly to eliminate a couple of scratches and nicks that had accumulated. Other than the odd minor thing(sunroof), it's been perfect.

While not a cheap car to maintain, it is a classic in a sense, and it provides you with a great ride, a great engine, and most of all, that quality feeling you get from driving a Mercedes-Benz. And if you're in the back seat, lean back and imagine you're an important political delegate. :)

Highly recommended if you can find a clean used one.
