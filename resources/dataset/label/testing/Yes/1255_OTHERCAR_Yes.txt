            The swivel body design is what intrigued me, and after using it for 6 months now, I am sold - especially in crowd settings. I do a lot of work at parties, receptions, family gatherings, etc., taking candid photos of the event. The camera can be held above your head, with the lens pointed at the subjects and the LCD pointed down at the you. In general, I prefer to shoot at eye level (for getting the best looking perspective on people). However, sometimes you just can't get the shot any other way, because others are in your way. Along a similar vein, photographing children can be done at their eye level by holding the camera body down at their height, lens pointed at them, and LCD pointed up toward you. You don't have to do body contortions to get a great shot. Last, but not least - even when no one is &quot;in the way&quot;, you can hold the camera out in front of you, pointing AWAY from a subject you want to capture on film - the lens is swiveled to point at them, LCD is pointed to you. If they happen to notice you, it appears you are looking at something besides them, so they remain natural and don't go into a &quot;pose&quot;, or worse, turn away, or hide. There are gizmos you can buy to do a 90 degree turn of the lens for the same purpose on other cameras, however, they don't have the flexibility of the swivel body on the Nikon. Of course, you get the quality Nikon lenses, and even though the boxy design of the body is not going to win any camera beauty contests, it is small enough to fit in your pants pocket (although somewhat bulky for that purpose).

This camera is two years old, and I may try to get another, faster, hgihger resolution oine in the future, but some feature of the Nikon 900 will be of interest to those considering newer nikon models and those getting used 900 cameras. I use a 48M CF Sandisk card which gives 73 highest res pictures. Hundreds if lower resolution is used. I plug it into a PCMIA slot for really fast downloading but have used the serial connection which was flaky for me. I use lithium batteries and get around 100 shots per set. The weaknesses are the speed is slow enough that it is easy to motion blur an image. The camera does not do well in low light. On the other hand the images are pretty impressive. The twist design takes a bit of getting used to, but it is really easy to use and allows for some fantastic shots. You can compose a shot right from the ground since the lcd and len are independent. <br><br>
