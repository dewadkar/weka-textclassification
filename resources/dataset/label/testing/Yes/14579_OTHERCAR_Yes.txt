            I purchased the MVC-FD5 approximately 4.5 years ago while on vacation in Florida.  I had bought a different digital camera earlier and was not satisfied with it's performance.  The Sony camera attracted me because it saved the pictures on a floppy disk which could interface with any computer without the need for any special software or hard connections etc.  I probably have approximately 2000 pictures on file today and I have to say that I have rarely taken a &quot;bad&quot; picture right from the start.  I attribute this to the ease of operation with this camera.  Kids as young as 5 and 6 years old have had no problems using this camera.  The battery life is great with the lithium battery pack.  I am currently thinking about upgrading as this earlier model does not have some of the enhancements the newer models now have.   will be purchasing another Sony and sending this one to my Son and Daughter-in-law so that they can send us pictures of their world 4000 miles away.  The only complaint I have about this camera is the fact that it did not come with a zoom lens and I don't think you can buy one today without this feature.<br><br>
