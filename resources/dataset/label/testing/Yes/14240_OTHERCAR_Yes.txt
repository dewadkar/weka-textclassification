            What does that mean?
If you're a driver that favors the gas pedal and doesn't
care about visibility, this is the car for you!

Don't get me wrong: I love my Infiniti. I bought the G20t in
May of this year and it's the nicest car I've ever owned.
Of course, the last new car I bought was a 1986 Nissan Sentra
so you can imagine what I am comparing it to.

I hate front-wheel drive cars and the G20 isn't changing my
mind. Don't let your attention wander when you hit the gas.
It does turn nicely, though, and is quite happy to be pushed
through turns as though it's a smaller car.

The largest design flaw I can point out is the horrid visibility
out the back. Backing up is a nightmare with this car! Any
obstacle lower than 5' is completely invisible. You have the
mirrors only; turning your head only gives you views of the seats.

Some folks like the spoiler. I asked if we could get the G20 without
it, but sorry, no. It adds nothing to performance and blocks even
more of the view out the back.

And what's with the &quot;armrest&quot; between the seats? Who is this thing
made for? It's so high I have a permanent tilt to my shoulders
from trying to get my elbow to clear it while shifting.

So if you want a beautiful, quick, inexpensive car that is fun
to drive, the Infiniti G20t is the one for you.

Just don't look back.<br><br>
