            The Chrysler 300m is in my opinion Chrysler's most luxurius, spacious and sporty cars. It has a gigantic trunk. The interior has leather seating and a wooden trim, it looks very sleek. It has chrome hubcaps that makes it shine in the sun and it has a variety of colors to choose from. The sound system is out of this world, it has many infiniti speakers. The engine is very quiet and smooth, and rides very nicely. The only thing that i do not like about it is the decieving look it gives off, but it is far nicer inside. I recommend this car to anyone who would like an affordable luxury with a sporty look.<br><br>
