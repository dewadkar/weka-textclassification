            Before I get started, I will apologize for using all metric units!  I don't know the imperial system- sorry!

I have owned my '94 Sunbird for about a year now.  I bought it for $4000 dollars, with about 110,000 kms on it. Unfortunately I don't know what that equals in miles for you imperial system users!

A few problems I have had with the car so far is that <b>it leaks oil sometimes,</b> so I often have to add a sealant.  Cheap, and easy.  Also, I believe I've had an anti-freeze leak before.  The repairs were not expensive though, compared to some of the other things that can go wrong with a car.

Overall, <b>it still runs fine after 8 long years.</b>  If you are thinking of buying a used car, Pontiac Sunbird is a good choice.  They last a long time, and in my experience, need little maintenance.  

<b>Fuel consumption in my opinion is pretty good.</b>  The gas tank is about 50 litres, and it can take you about 500km or so.  

There are a few things that bug me about the car:
My Sunbird is a 2 door, and one thing that bugs me is the <b>the doors are huge and heavy.</b> It is so easy to smack another car in the parking lot because the doors almost swing open on their own, since they are so heavy.  I always have to tell the passenger- "watch your door eh?".  When it is windy out, the doors easily get blown wide open!

<b>The drivers side seat feels very low to me.</b>  I am 5 feet and 3 inches, and I feel like I can't see over the dashboard, so I sit on a pillow.  If this car had tilt steering then I wouldn't need my little pillow!

<b>And the windsheild wipers are really annoying.</b>  There is no "delay" on them, so they either go fast, or faster.  And when it is just drizzling out, a delay on the wipers would be nice instead of pushing the button every time to make them wipe.

Other then that, I have been pretty rough on the car, and it can really take a beating!  I would recommend doing the oil changes every 3 months like you are supposed to do- it really helps to keep the car running smoothly.  The car used to shake when I hit speeds of 120 kmph or so, but now it never does since I have been quite regular with oil changes.
