            Today was the greatest day of my life when I got to drive the Honda S2000. This got to be one of the fastest and great looking car I ever seen. Even though this was my car but my friend was nice enough to allow me to test drive the car. I got to amit that if that was my car I wouldn't allow anyone to drive my car. This car is only a four cylinder but it produce over 200 horse power more than any other roadster car. The price of this car might cost almost as much as the other roadster but it worth the cost and the waiting list. The car has a lot of room and is very comfortable. The car look like half Z3 and half porsche. After I am done driving the car I just wish I can just go to the dealership and purchase it.<br><br>
