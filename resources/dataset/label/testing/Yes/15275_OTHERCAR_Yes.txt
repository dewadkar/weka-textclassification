            Hello all, well if you are like me you have a jar at home that is full of undeveloped film.  I got tired of this and went out looking for a digital camera that could help capture that &quot;special&quot; moment and be cheaper than developing film.  I purchased this model because of the disk drive!  How easy, no worry's about having enough memory chips or how to import the pictures while on vacation.  The fact that it also records 60 second MPEG's was just an added bonus.  Works great with about a 2 hour battery life (average battery lasts 60-90 minutes).
All in all a good buy, expensive but I like it, hope you do to.<br><br>
