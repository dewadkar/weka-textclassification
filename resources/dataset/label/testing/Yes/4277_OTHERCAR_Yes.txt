            OK, I'm an architect, and I appreciate nice design and that is why I bought my Beetle. I have 109,000 miles on it. I love the car, but get ready for nagging VISUAL and functional problems if you own the car more than 5 years! Volkswagen needs to design more durable and functional interior parts, in particular:

1) The electronic mirror aiming switch broke off with normal use. This will cost $50-60.00 to replace

2)  The plastic upper storage cabinet has all plastic parts and I used it very sparingly but it was so flimsy and poorly designed that the latching mechanism broke.  This costs about 40.00 to replace, counting labor. I recommend new users to not use this compartment for anything and then you may be able to avoid replacing it.

3)  Never use the cool looking bra which is available through VW.  Even when this is installed properly and you clean it and the car religiously, this poorly designed accessory wears holes in your paint finish where the bra vibrates when driven at highway speeds.

4)  The cupholders are a cool idea, and worked well for me initially but these plastic accessories are not easily cleaned and age quickly.  The plastic get brittle with time and the attachments at the bottom of the holders break off.  Again, cheap, cheap plastic parts that don't last. They cost 25.00 each to replace!!

5)  A very stupid thing that VW has built into the beetle is a very low grade paint finish at the steering wheel (planned visual obsolescence).  The silver has worn off and now the black undercoat is showing through.  How long does it take a company manufacturing cars to come up a durable finish?  I will have to touch this up myself and I'm sure it will not look right.

6)  The headlamps of course are always on.  This feature means you will burn through untold number of lamps during the life of the car.  This is unnecessary and does nothing for safety in my opinion. Again, you look bad with one black eye and you never know when you are going to get one.

7)  The AC, CD/Radio and heater have worked excellently, although the AM/FM radio is not a very sensitive tuner.  I am sure VW could get a better one.

8)  The sun visors are decorative only.  You cannot turn them to the side and get any meaningful shading.  They only shade the sun from head-on.

9)  The power window on the driver's side has been the bane of my existence.  It gets out of adjustment very easily and will bind 2/3 the way up, which means it automatically goes all the way down when this happens.  I go through a lot of toll booths in sub-zero weather, and now I have to open the door to pay the toll...lest I stop the car and muscle the window up in cold weather when it won't close.  If these parts can't work reliably, I would prefer a manual window crank for the drivers window which gets 10 times as much use as the other side.  This, again, is just cheap engineering.  This has been a problem since I first bought the car.

10) The plasticiszed fabric/cover at the gear shift is very sensitive to wear and mine is in awful shape and needs replacement after 3-1/2 years!!!!!

11)  The interior decor of my beetle is very light "camel" color.  The seats are very prone to staining. Too bad we can't appreciate the look because we have to immediately cover up the seats with less than cool looking seat covers. 

In conclusion My take on my VW is they have a great body design and interior concept and have buggered it up the big time by introducing flimsy stuff and stupic "cute" ideas that DO NOT enhance the appearance or use of the car and makes it a maintenance nightmare when the car ages.  In short, this car does not age well, as opposed to the much more basic original beetle.  Perhaps VW wanted the new beetle to be a throw-away car and, actually, have not given us much choice in the matter!!!

Again, great concept and look, great design, but lousy lousy engineering in the details!!!  

We are not talking about a lot to make this car better, just a little more care!!


Please!!
