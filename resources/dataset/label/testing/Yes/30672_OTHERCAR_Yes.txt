            One of the best merits of the Grand Cherokee Limited is the sharp edge body design. Other SUVs in this size/price class have curved all the corners. 

The Grand Cherokee Limited comes with a large load of standard equipment - as well as it should for a starting price of $31,885 - including a/c, power steering, power brakes, poewr mirrors, power locks, 10-way power seats w/ power recline and lumbar systems, tinted glass, a remote locking/security system, leather trim, tilt steering, cruise control, aluminum wheels, premium AM/FM/cassette audio, fog lamps, a roof rack, and a pair of consoles, one overhead, one between the front seats. The Limite package adds heated seats, a power sunroof, and an upgraded sound system with three-band graphic equalizer. 

The optional 5.2-liter V8 engine was an additional $877.00. The V8 makes 220 horsepower and generates 300 pound-feet of torque.  Its also rated to pull a 6500 pound trailer.

At more than $37,000 its well into the luxury realm, but its got style, power, plenty of equipment and very serious off-road capability.
