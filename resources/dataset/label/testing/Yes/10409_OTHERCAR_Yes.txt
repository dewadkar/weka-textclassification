After owning and using a FUJIFILM MX-1200 for quite awhile, I was quite impressed with the C50. Although a little pricey, it has all the features I need. I'm not a professional, but full auto for my family members and manual mode for my creativity is nice.

I upgraded to a 64MB xD Picture Card (about $70.) for expanded storage.

The size is nice too. Small, yet easy to hold.
I also picked up an extra LI-10B Lithium Ion battery. (about $70. also), but recommended. 
It has the standard type viewfinder (1.5" LCD screen), but is very crisp and clear.

I really like the lithium ion battery and charger too. Beats the heck out of a case of batteries!

Package included a 32MB xD-Picture Card (I upgraded to 64MB);
Rechargeable LI-10B Li-Ion Battery and Charger;
RM-1 Wireless Remote Control;
Digital Camera Win/Mac USB Cable;
Video Cable;
Wrist Strap;
Quick Start Guide;
Printed Instruction Manual;
Warranty Card;
CD-ROM: CAMEDIA Master Software,
Windows� 98 Rev 2 Driver and Camera Reference Manual. 

I really like the 3x optical/4x digital zoom, especially after having the FUJIFILM MX-1200 (entry level) camera for so long. As well, the quick connect USB and five flash modes make it even more desirable.

The Macro-Focus worked very nicely too. When I sell items on eBay I sometimes need good, clear close-ups. Very happy with this feature too.

I'm very happy with the C50 and will probably have it for quite awhile, especially since I darn near broke the bank! Just kidding!

Honestly though, I'm really happy my less technical family members have something they can just 'Point and Shoot', and I have the extra features that will keep me happy for quite awhile.
