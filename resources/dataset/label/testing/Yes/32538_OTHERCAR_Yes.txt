               I recieved one of these wonderful looking cars as a high school student to drive my self to school. With a 5spd and a sunroof I thought I was driving a high class sportscar. 

   In reality, the car has a real lack of acceleration. The 5spd helps a bit with this though, as you are able to downshift to get that extra bit of power.

   Well.. I enjoyed my car for 3 days until I hit a corner going about 60 mph with a friend of mine in the car and slammed into another car after I tapped the breaks in the middle of the turn and lost control. It was essentially a head on collosion... both my friend and I walked away from the crash. We both had our seatbelts on and both the airbags in the car went off. The car was badly totalled. 

   All I can say is that I loved the car when I had it, save for the fact that it looks much more of a sportscar then it really is. If you have to get one try to get a SC2 with a 5spd, not a SC1.. and for godsake dont get an automatic. I have to vouch though, the car is safe. You can find them cheap too, the wholesale price is about 4000, I bought mine for 3995.. only problem was that the speakers were all blown out in the back and the sunroof had had a leak. 
  
  Saturns are good reliable cars, and if you want a sporty looking one that is fun to drive to work/school look out for one of these great cars. Get a 5spd SC2, and before long youll be taking the long way home.
