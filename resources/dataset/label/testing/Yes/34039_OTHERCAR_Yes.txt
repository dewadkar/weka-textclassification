            Exterior: Kinda boring. I personally dont get very excited about 10 year old american family cars. Atleast the cops will pull over the guy in that sports car before they get you. Like the integrated fog lights. 5 of 10

Interior: Half decent. Seats are padded well but are a fixed bench which makes you sit up in an uncomfortable position. Dash layout is great for holding trash on the instrument panel, but dont expect much information. Most important gauges (oil pressure, temp, battery, etc) have been replaced by idiot lights. 5 of 10

Engine: 3.1 V6 puts out just as much Horsepower as my 1.8 4 in my Acura. Doesnt get nearly as good fuel economy. Havent had any mechanical problems, which is the most important thing in a cheap vehicle like this.
6 of 10

Handling: Not much fun to drive. You can push it a suprising amount in turns, but you dont have much warning before the tires start loosing traction and you lose control. Power steering has way too much assist and doesnt pass enough road feel to steering wheel. 6 of 10 

Ride: Think of what a new sports car would ride like. Pretty rough, right? 
Same thing here, although it would probably get better with new shocks and 
struts. 6 of 10

Reliability: Mine has 145,000 miles with nary a mechanical problem. For the $1,000 I paid for it a year ago, its been worth it so far. Ive always been wary of the reliability of american cars vs jap cars, but it looks as though we are closing the gap. 8 of 10

Value: Havent put much money into it since it was bought a year ago, so overall I would say its a pretty good value. 8 of 10 

Overall: Cant pick up chicks in the car, and its not much to look at, but it runs, and thats what I expect of it. 6 of 10
