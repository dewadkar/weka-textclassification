            We bought this vehicle because of its dependability. We needed a family car with room. It seats up to six comfortably.   The back seat has shoulder and lap seatbelts for each occupant. The front seat has an arm rest and a drink holder that will fold down when not in use. The sound quality of the stereo is exceptional.   There is plenty of trunk space for our boys backpacks and sporting equipment. The back seats fold forward for more storage from the trunk. We love the look and the way it handles on the road.   The Ford Taurus drives very smooth and is easy to handle. We would seriously consider another Taurus when we trade this one in. We purchased a 1999 Taurus SE.   We enjoy this vehicle very much. I cannot find anything I hate about our new car. My 13 year old son calls this our cool car. He loves to ride in it.   I feel this is a car for families and also people in business where they take clients out. It is very impressive in its looks and driving qualities. This car would not be for people who do not want to have fun, enjoy the ride, and have a dependable car.    <br><br>
