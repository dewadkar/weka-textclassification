            The Mitsubishi Eclipse is the best sports car for your money.  This car is very stylish and runs great.  I have a 1996 RS and even after 3 1/2 years, this car still runs like new.  It has great handling for all you adventrous drivers.  The inside of the car is great.  It has very easy to use climate control and given the amount of space on the inside, it heats up (or cools down) very quickly.  As you have probably seen, the body style is killer.  I can not count all of the compliments i have been given while having this car.  The only complaint I have about this car is that sometimes you will bottom out while pulling out from a hill. 
     Over all I give this car an 8 out of 10. I would recommend this car to anyone who likes to have fun driving.   <br><br>
