            I had for several years watched with interest as the &quot;Saturn phenomenon&quot; grew in both volume and intensity. I was rather surprised, after doing some research, to learn that the company was actually trying to do what it had set out to do, which is build a different kind of car company and, hence, a different kind of car. When a nincompoop cut me off like a razor on Highway 680 one fine Sunday afternoon in 1996, causing me to total my beloved Pontiac 6000LE, I naturally turned to Saturn for a new vehicle. I have not been sorry, and would recommend this make and model to just about anyone. Nevertheless, there are a few things a prospective buyer should keep in mind.

Engine noise can sometimes be annoying at very high speeds. For the love of God don't try and treat it like a sports car or you're liable to kill yourself and somebody else in the process. The wheel base is just too narrow to handle tight corners very well, or, for that matter, to handle parking lots very well (the thing has a turn radius like a Mack truck). Visibility when backing up is frankly not very good, so I advise greater than normal caution when doing so. Also, it would be unwise to place breakables in the trunk; as it has no well, things have a tendency to slide around back there even when you take turns slowly and carefully. So much for the negatives.

The positives are almost infinite. The ride is smooth and easy, and at legal speeds is relatively quiet; over 70mph is another story (see above). The aerodynamics on this vehicle are outstanding; I've gone over the Cuesta Grade in Central California, as well as the Altamont Pass, and have had nary a problem. I believe this contributes to the outstanding gas mileage I get with this car. Normally it runs about 27 mpg in the city and 34 mpg on the highway, and that's <i>after four years and 60,000 miles</i>. I can hardly imagine a car doing much better for the price. And the amenities!

A fully-appointed Saturn feels very luxurious, especially if you keep it relatively clean. The ergonomics are such that most people will find the interior very comfortable, and every control on the console is within easy reach. The glove compartment is just large enough to be useful, and small enough not to be cumbersome. The back seats fold down to double the cargo space of the trunk (<b>Safety Tip</b>: Whatever you do, don't haul metal or wooden polls or pieces, because there's really no way to tie them down and a sudden stop at high speed could impale you and/or your passenger). The stereo system is first-rate, with excellent acoustics. And, of course, there a few nice extra touches, like a magazine/book holder on the back of the front passenger seat.

One of the primary selling points of any Saturn is its safety features. There are many, though one of them is somewhat dubious at best. The best include the airbags - there are two of them, one for the driver and one for the passenger; the reinforcement in the top, in case of roll-overs; the reinforcement in the side doors, in case of side collisions. The one that gives pause is the &quot;drop engine&quot;, which allows for same to instantly drop down and beneath the car in the event of a head-on collision. This will purportedly protect the driver from having the engine slammed onto their lap, and while I understand the thinking that went into this, I wonder if perhaps in some cases that engine would act as a valuable, added buffer between the driver and whatever they're hitting. Also, though I like the reinforcement in the top and sides, I feel that in all modern sedans its rather like &quot;vitamin-enriched&quot; bread; an awful lot of steel has been removed for fuel economy and design efficiency, and then some of it is put back in the form of &quot;reinforcement bars&quot;. Still wouldn't want to run into a truck, or even an SUV.

Regarding maintenance the Saturn has been a dream: No sudden breakdowns and no major repair work needed thus far. I'm VERY glad I bought this car. Words to the wise, though: Don't be too fooled by the &quot;different kind of car company&quot; shpiel when it comes time to sign on the bottom line. The sell I received was, in its own clever way, as hard as I imagine anyone's has ever been, including for used cars. I had excellent though relatively recent credit when I walked into the showroom, yet despite this I was given a &quot;choice&quot; of a Bad Deal, a Worse Deal and the Worst Deal. I took the bad one, and so have been paying through the nose every month since. Again, something to keep in mind.

You could do much worse than a Saturn sedan. While I haven't gone koo-koo and joined any &quot;owners clubs&quot;, and I don't show up for any of the &quot;friendly barbeques&quot;, I definitely recommend Saturns whenever I'm asked about mine, which is quite often.<br><br>
