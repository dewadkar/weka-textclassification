            Set your expectations right for this camera.  It's not for professional use, but can be used by one.

It is compact, stylish, and has lots of features that will appeal to a wide audience:  

1) It's relatively cheap.  I got a great deal at 800.com when Microsoft was promoting their Passport Wallet - $311 and a $50 gift certificate (net $261).

2) It has zoom.

3) It has a macro feature for those close shots.

4) The camera has multiple flash options - for the reduction of red-eye, for night shots, and so on.

5) It has a menu system that can help you modify the camera's settings to meet your specific needs (i.e. adjust white balance).

6) You can toss out crappy photos as you take them.

7) Olympus provides some neat software to help you edit your shots (you shout get Corel or Adobe though for really cool effects).

And that's about it.  What more do you want?  This is not a complicated camera and why should it be.  It's designed to be compact, fun, and cheap.<br><br>
