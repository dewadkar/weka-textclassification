            Up until the beginning of the 1970�s, Cadillac was known as �The Standard of the World�. Cadillac did not have the best product, by any means, but that didn�t matter. Cadillac was not just selling a car, but a lifestyle. Certainly, faster cars were coming out of Italy, more attractive cars coming out of England, and better engineered cars from Germany. Cadillac, though was able to capture a bit of all of that and offer it at a reasonable price. Plus, Cadillacs were more reliable than the English makes, more luxurious than the Italian makes, and more creatively styled than (most) German makes. Cadillacs meant that you had arrived in society. People scrambled to buy them new and used. Sometimes, three and four middle class families would go in together to buy one, and then share it. Cadillac did it�s part, by offering one unique product after another, be it with stainless steel trim, mile high fins, tons of power, or even front wheel drive. This last innovation, I would like to further speak on because it shaped Cadillac engineering from it�s late 60�s introduction until this day, and because it was the last notable offering Cadillac had before they lost the market. After the initial rise of the first, smartly styled front wheel drive Eldorado in 67�, everything went down hill. Even the Rat Pack caved into the better products from Europe when Frank bought his first Mercedes in the early 70�s. A few higher points ensued, such as in 1975, when Cadillac�s new compact Seville saw success and in the early eighties when Eldorado�s became the flavor of the month. On the whole, though, poor styling like the bustle back Seville, poor engineering, like the V-8-6-4 engines, and poor products like the Cimarron, left a bad taste in the publics mouth. That is until GM did something drastic, by offering the first truly unique concept in 20 years � the Allante.

The Allante hit the streets in 1987 to much fan fare, but ultimately little substance. Initially conceived in 1982, the LTS or Luxury-Two-Seater project kicked off to much anticipation. Cadillac, in an effort to reclaim its position on top of the motoring heap decided that an exciting, sports car would be just the answer, plus, it would fill a whole left in the product line since styling had forced the Eldorado down market. Seeing that the revitalized convertible market was not just a fad Cadillac thought this new rag top would be the perfect tool for shaking up its image, and taking a piece of the pie that Mercedes Benz had monopolized for so long. The two regning champs of the premium, sports convertible market (the Mercedes 560SL and Jaguar XJS), were going on 15 to 20 years in age, and the public wanted something more. Cadillac also had a unique ace up their sleeve in that they could produce all the front drive, eight cylinder transaxles needed, and at this point, rear drive was looking to be on the way out. The GM-30 platform, which had done so well supporting the Tornado, Riviera, and Eldorado, was a proven template for front drive powertrains and was cheap and easy to produce. So, engineering mostly settled upon, the only thing left was the body. GM had come under extraneous fire in recent years for poor badge engineering practices that resulted in allot of models looking nearly identical. In an effort to combat this notion and elevate the new Caddy to world car status, GM contracted with Pininfarina (noted Italian body fabricator) to design and produce the bodies in Turin, and then fly them on specially prepared planes to Detroit for final assembly. Frankly, it was an unnecessary step that ultimately drove the price up too high, but Cadillac wanted that Pininfarina logo on the front fender to bolster snob appeal. When the bodies arrived, they were fitted with modified versions of Cadillac�s corporate standard, the 4.1-liter V8 and 4-speed automatic. Also, the cars received modified Eldorado suspensions and custom aluminum rims, fitted with 15-inch tires. The standard features list was lengthy, the only options being a removable hard top and cell phone.

As stated, GM and the motoring press made a big deal of the Allante. Ultimately, though, once the reviews began to surface, nobody was really all that impressed � which lead to modest initial sales. Styling was attractive and unique, by all means. But the design work was very reserved for Pininfarina, a company that also created the Alfa Romeo 1600 Duetto Spyder and Ferrari Testarossa. The center console was designed to look very high tech, but ended up as a rather confusing array of tightly packed buttons. Interior comfort was notable from wide seats and headrests with rich feeling leather, but the seats were too flat for performance driving. Head and shoulder room was satisfactory at 37.3 and 43.1 inches respectively, but the low driving position and high tail section made visibility only average. Most of this mediocrity, was forgivable because the car did appear exotic, and a bit of compromise in exchange for the good stuff, is what and exotic car was all about. The real problem with the Allante was the transaxle. The modified 4.1/4-speed combo from the Eldorado only made 170 horsepower (though this was 30 more than it's platform mates made). Aside from being a bit tame, this big sedan engine couldn�t rev like the Jag and hadn�t the torque of the Mercedes. It didn�t sound, or feel very sporty either. Plus, the car handled a lot like an Eldorado, only harsher.  A year later, the Allante received Cadillac�s new 4.5 liter plant that garnered a power boast, but the affect was still a bit tame. Plus, things in the market were about to get worse.

As 1990 rolled around, the Allante�s initial asking price had risen from the mid $50�s to the early $60�s. This began to wear at Cadillac�s price advantage over Mercedes Benz and Jaguar. Plus, Mercedes Benz finally released a new SL class convertible and every other premium offering disappeared off the scope. The new Benz was beautiful, fast, and a technological wonder. The only thing Cadillac had to offer that year on the Allante, was traction control. To make matters worse, on the new generation of SL, Mercedes offered a bargain priced 6-cylinder model that still performed better than the Allante, and was close in price. Just as Mercedes began to squeeze Cadillac from the high end, down, BMW�s upstart 325i convertible, which had been gaining popularity in recent years, began to seriously eat into the high end market, only from the bottom, up. Though no where near the Benz and Caddy in terms of price, the little Bimmer opened high end convertible motoring to a whole new level of upper-middle class buyers, and even ingratiated itself with the rich. Cadillac needed to act fast.  Fortunately, there was yet another card for Cadillac to play. While all of this was happening, GM was hard at work on engineering strategies to compete on the world stage. The result was better quality, improved handling dynamics, and a little miracle called �Northstar�. 
Cadillac had been toying with a world class engine for some time, one that would elevate them to the ranks of technological elite and high performance once more. The resulting product was a small 4.6-liter, dual overhead cam, 32 valve, all aluminum engine, sporting variable valve timing. The plant generated an incredible 295 horsepower (63 horsepower per liter) and 290 pound feet of torque. For 1993, Cadillac applied all of their new toys, to the flagship Allante. 

On the road, the new Allante posted sub 6-second 0-60 times, and ran circles around the 300SL in almost very way. The powerplant was one of the smoothest you could find, and had a rich, lusty exhaust note. The new electronically controlled transmission put the power to the ground flawlessly with little torque steer. The transmission was an evolution of Buick�s 4-speed Dynaflow unit. This technology didn�t hut and peck like the old Cadillac 4-speed. Instead, shifts were perfectly timed by the engine management computer, which, coincidentally enough, also managed power flow � nice. Engine is matched before and after shifts with reductions in engine timing. Shifts are subsequently, short, quick, and nearly undetectable. The independent rear suspension now boasted real dampening characteristics and felt very active. Though the basic suspension design of short upper and long lower arm, with multilink componentry, was unchanged, new speed dependent dampers and Goodyear Eagle GA�s were unflappable in the twisties. Also, speed sensitive steering was light and precise when parking, with a lot of road feel at high speeds. The electronically controlled and hydraulically actuated steering alters effort based on driving situations and never missed a step. Body styling was untouched, but higher quality paint was used and a new, deeper front air dam made the body appear lower. Also, larger, more distinctive aluminum rims filled the wheel wells better and portrayed a better wheel/body relationship. The small cosmetic changes allowed the Allante to look more aggressive and modern. Interior styling was warmed over a bit as well, making the dash seem less threatening. The product was undeniably where it should have been all along and boasted good things in Cadillac�s future. Sadly, though, lagging sales and poor public image must have seemed to great of obstacles to the GM brass, and just when the Allante became truly great.
 
The Allante ended its six-year run at the close of the 1993 model year, falling victim to what I like to call �GM Syndrome�.  Since the 1970�s, General Motors has periodically released poorly executed products that meet with tepid reviews and lack luster sales. Then, after a few years, of steady improvement and determination, the product turns into something worthwhile. Sales may even begin to pick up. Just when things finally beginning to turn around, the General pulls the plug. Other victims of this disease are the Buick Reatta, Pontiac Fiero, and Cadillac�s own Cimarron. The death of the poor Allante is �GM Syndrome� at it�s very worst. The Allante�s stay at Cadillac was during one of the darkest periods in the make�s history. Cadillac styling and technology were the incendiary devices to the bon fire of poor taste in the automotive industry. The redesigned Brougham was one of the most counter-productive products for Cadillac�s image in history. The DeVille, already a rehash of old parts, was on borrowed time. Also, horrific styling failures of the recent past had produced a bold new Seville that was so overly cautious and non-committing that it was difficult to tell what it wanted to be when it grew up. Then there was the Allante, the one link to the world�s automotive stage that was slowly being choked to death by an unforgiving market and the sins of her sister products. Even with the last minute injection of all the right performance applications, which, mind you, was the missing piece to the Allante formula, the car found itself without a leg to stand on. Mercedes Benz ultimately had the high-end convertible market. Chrysler�s Lebaron had the low end, and BMW picked up all the wannabe yuppies in between. With all this pressure and no more patience, GM gave up the ghost on the slow selling Allante. Now, if Cadillac had decided to put the Allante on the chopping block when this exact same melodrama was occurring a mere one year sooner (sans Northstar), I would have volunteered to swing the axe myself. But the overly conservative, though fresh, 92� Seville showed commitment to a new styling direction and the Northstar proved that Cadillac was still committed to technological excellence. The stage was set for a truly world class, second generation Allante. But, in typical General Motors fashion, the brass were unwilling to wait and see.
