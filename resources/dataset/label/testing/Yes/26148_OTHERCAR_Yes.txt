            The 91 300zx twin turbo is a really fast car. The yellow model is one of the rarest colors to acquire. The car has 300 hp and 283 lb of torque making it reach 0-60 mph in a mere 5.5 seconds. Some of my friends who drove it say, &quot;It was so fast it took me a few minutes to catch up with how fast I was really going.&quot; 

The car can be easily boosted up to 400 hp for only a couple hundred bucks. Making better than Porsche's, BMW's, and Vett's. This is definitely the car for those who want power and looks with very a little amount of money spent. The modifications have been nearly perfected on the car and I recommend to buy Stillen modifications from a trusted retailer (YellowZXTT@aol.com) if you want real POWER. The Z's are really rare though, it is hard to find one in good condition. The twin turbos are especially hard to find. This car is fun to drive and is basically for anyone who wants a fun, inexpensive, good looking, and fast car. The engine and turbos are really reliable with regular maintenance and service. It would be a good idea to change the oil every 3k miles and get a turbo timer so the oil doesn't sit in the turbos and ruin them. The body design form 91-93 was basically the same and the 94-96 body styles on the turbos had a different wing style. This was the last year they made them and really rare ones to find. 

I can only find one minor flaw, which is the back. I really don't like the lights on the back on the stock models. But that can be changed with an after market piece with round rear lights. After market body kits also make a nice touch to the Z's. This car is also not recommended for those who do not want to go through the maintaining the car because sports cars require work and dedication if you want them to last and run great.<br><br>
