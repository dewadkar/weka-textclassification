            We bought this vehicle because the lease was up on our previous car (Honda Accord LX) and we were looking for a safer and larger car.

The Diamante has a &quot;cage&quot; design that is far safer in crashes than the Accord.  Our three year old was the primary motivation for pursuing a safer vehicle.  Additionally, the Diamante offers child-proof door locks and child-proof window locks.  (Wonderful feature when your child likes to toss his sun protector out the window!)

We also needed more space than the Accord could offer.  We gained that space especially in the back seat.  The front seat is still not roomy enough for my husband, who is 5ft. 11 inches. But since I am the primary driver, this was not a factor.  

One of the nicest features, is control of the CD, radio, etc. from the steering wheel.  Once you have the buttons memorized, there is almost no reason to look away from the road to change a station or control the volume.

Another nice amenity are the cup-holders.  There are six total in the car.  Two in the back seat and four up front.  Out of these six, four are expandable to accommodate oversized cups.  Thank God somebody got the message!

I am still trying to master the remote keyless entry....two pushes unlocks the driver door, three seems to lock the driver door and unlock the passenger and back doors?  I'm sure this is operator error and with practice I'll get it under control.  

I love the pick-up this car has!  It is a six cylinder with 210 horsepower and makes a very smooth and quiet transition from 40mph to 70mph in a small amount of time.

I would suggest that this is a luxury car for those who can't necessarily afford a Lexus.
