            I've owned, borrowed, and rented various cars over the years and I keep coming back to one vehicle that is just about perfect...the good old 626.

My first car was a 1983 2-Door 626.  It was only a couple of years old but had been a sales car so had racked up the miles. When I got it as a junior in high school it had well over 100,000 miles on it.  By the time I had to call the wrecking yard to come take her home, I'd driven it across the country 4 times and had put well over 200,000 miles on it.

I thrashed that car - treated it as bad as every teenager treats a car. Neglected the oil, drove 90 miles an hour down a dirt road with potholes the size of Texas and crammed 6 of my friends in it on a regular basis.  It took a serious beating and ran until the day I got rid of it.  The engine was still going strong when the suspension, brakes, and about a million other little things added up to more than another used 626 with less miles would cost.  

In between I've owned several other vehicles including a Mazda B2000 pick up that I gave to a friend of mine and is currently approaching the 200,000 mile mark.

After suffering through unreliability and rough running (non-Mazda)vehicles I bought myself another 626 this past summer.  It's a 1990 4 door automatic that I picked up for $2200 with 160,000 miles on it.  It runs great, handles great, and gets super gas mileage. It will probably get me through the next 2-4 years.  It has decent horsepower (read merging into traffic isn't a problem) it looks nice and it has plenty of leg room both fore and aft.

I have absolutely no complaints with the 626.  In my opinion it's at least as good as comparably equipped Accord, costs less, and is less likely to be stolen.  If you're looking for a solid used car find a private person who's upgrading to a newer model and relieve them of their 626 that has over 100,000 miles on it.  In my experience a Mazda that's passed the 100,000 mile mark has already had the routine major maintenance done on it, and will likely go another 100,000 miles with little more than routine oil changes and brake jobs.

Remember though, that when you buy *any* used car it's only as good as its maintenance record.  Ask questions about oil changes, recent repairs, etc. If the car looks mistreated and you get a bad &quot;hit&quot; off of the current owner, look elsewhere.  I always buy from a private person, not a dealer.  It takes more leg work to find the right vehicle but if you're patient and do your homework, the right vehicle will present itself and you and the seller will save/get more cash out of the deal than if you go through the used car middleman.

Bottom Line: If you want an affordable, reliable used car look for a Mazda 626.
