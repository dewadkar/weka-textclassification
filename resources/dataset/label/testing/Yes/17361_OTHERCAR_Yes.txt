            This year the Honda Accord has undergone some changes to it's styling while delivering a car which for the most part has been a pinnacle in the industry throughout the years.

The performance, reliability and handling are among the best in the industry, and the EX model provides additional bells and whistles that most living rooms can't live up to. The sound system is excellent and boasts an in-dash tape and 6 disc CD changer.

The styling has much to be desired, and nearly everyone drives one. They are also among the first cars to be targeted in car theft, but thanks to car alarms and anti-theft devices, it has squelched much of this to the chagrin of the thieves.

In all an excellent buy for the money! Just be willing to look like everyone else!
