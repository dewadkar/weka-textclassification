            We traded my wife's Jeep Grand Cherokee for the Pacifica, looking for more seating versatility. Here's what I like and don't (but I must say there are very few don'ts). I like the handling. It drives more like a sport sedan than anything else. The minivans we tested drove like vans (sway, no power, long stops) but this car drives great and the brakes are like butter. I like the seats. The 2nd row seats are absolutely the most comfortable of any ride, If you don't believe me...sit in one. I like the safety...all rows of seats have side airbags so extra protection for our young ones in back. I like the dvd system...keeps the kids quiet. I love the styling...very svelt. I love the 3rd row seating when we have extra passengers and they fold down when not needed to give almost as much cargo room as the Jeep. I like the power liftgate. I like the autostick...very cool way to shift. I like the LATCH system for child seats. Don't likes: Could use a little more power...not bad but a v8 would be awsome. Little noisy over bumps but FEELS solid. Stereo with CD changer could use more power w/o having to spend the extra bucks for the intermezzo system. DVD screen is a little small, makes it hard to watch when bumpy. Rear doors could open a little wider for child seats, etc. No factory towing pkg available.
