              I bought this car back in 1974 for around $2,500.It was a sport coupe with a 375 hp, 396 cu in big block.The transmission was a turbo 400 automatic with 3:23 posi rear end.I had dual exhaust and factory wheels on this car.I loved how this car cruised down the highway.I could get an honest 16.5 mpg at 70-80 mph.
The car rode smooth as silk and did not react very badly to side winds.Quartermile performance was sluggish due to the massive size of the car but once it was rolling the speed climbed very quickly under full throttle application.
Also, the dashboard and grills were different in this car from the small block equipped cars.I found this out the hard way after hitting a deer at 60 mph in it.The grill was almost impossible to find as was body parts.This is a one only year car body style.The 1967's and 1969's do not interchange any body parts.That's what is unique about this car.
Anybody who can do maintenance on this car should own it.Anybody that can't work on cars should not own this.This car was very reliable as parts are easy to get for the mechanics part of maintenance. I did not have any major breakdowns with this car.It was very well built.This car sits low and it goes.<br><br>
