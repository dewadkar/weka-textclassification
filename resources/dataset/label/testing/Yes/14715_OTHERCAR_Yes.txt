            My 15 years of driving experience has put me behind the wheel of 6 different cars.  Of the six, 4 were subaru's.  I know their reliability and track record and when the time came to purchase my most recent new car I didn't hesitate to choose a subaru.  

I am an avid outdoors person and require a car with lots of room, excellent handling in all terrains, economical gas mileage and of course  a car I want to drive.  The impreza sport delivers high marks in all the above categories.  
                   1. Cargo Room
                       -with the hatchback door and the folding back seats I have no problem fitting my tent, rock climbing gear, camping equipment for 2, an ice cooler and whatever else I may need for a weekend.
Subaru provides twos optional features I recommend, one a plastic cargo shield and two a cargo mat which hides your valuables from site and protects the floor from the mud and guts of an adventure weekend.
                   2. All Wheel Drive/ Anti-lock brakes (ABS)
                      -the AWD feature is a standard with all subaru's and it is the easiest system to use-just drive the car it's always engaged. This system handles snow, sleet, and rain as good or better than any four wheel drive truck on the market.  To comment on the ABS, let just say they have saved me several times from otherwise certain accidents.  Every car should have them!!
                   3.  Gas Mileage
                      -what other all-wheel-drive vehicle can you venture over 300 miles on one, yes ONE tank of gas...nothing more to say.

I should also comment on the pick-up of this little car.  A huge improvement on past subaru's.  My last car would slow down going up hills. The new impreza cruises easily at 75 MPH and goes up 15 degree inclines with nothing but a flinch. <br><br>
