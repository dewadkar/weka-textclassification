            I love outdoors ,that's why i decided to find a replace for my OLD(90) ford F-150; I took the local newspaper and headed to the SUV's dealers;before the TROOPER i consider  2 options, but what really caught my attention was the PRICE,wow!! -I said- $24999 for a new SUV well i end up buying it.What i love about this SUV is the several options that it came with it.That was 9 months ago so far the only problem that i had was a faulty window leveler that it was replaced by the dealer.
I also found that this SUV is not good for going to work or to the mall because is a GAS GUZZLER -it give you like 13 mpg- and also is very sluggish and feels very heavy(4000 tons)-not good for racing-, but is EXCELLENT offroads so far i went with it to the GREAT SMOKEY MOUNTAINS and also i drove it in several beaches and places were you can take natural photography and only you can access there with a 4wd.
The cargo space is excellent which help me a lot with my camera and video equipment.Also i'll comment about the issue that this SUV has a tendency to TIP in two wheels when you corner (see Consumer Reports october 97) is not true, but just in case u can do what i did;i bought a 285/75/16 set of tires and wheels and VOILA!!! handles better than before;u can also lowered a little by buying a 15&quot; set   of tires this won't be a problem since the TROOPER got a big ground clearance.That report,lack of sales and high competition by other SUV's is the main reason for the price and lots and lots of extras and i feel happy for this.<br><br>
