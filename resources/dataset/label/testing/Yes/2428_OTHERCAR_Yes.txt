            My 95 Jeep Cherokee was the first car I bought new and it has treated me well. I have a 17 foot boat and it pulls it with ease. I have taken my pop up trailer in the mountain and no problems their either. It has more acceleration than most trucks and this is due to the large (200 hp) engine paired with a light body. It is not one of the new sport utility vehicles that rides smooth, but instead has maintained it's truck ride. It is also louder than most vehicles on the road. The interior is standard with no frills, however I wish the rear door wear larger as people have difficulty getting in and out. I also feel the paint job is of poor quality as the paint began bubbling after 1 year. I have never put the Jeep in the shop for anything I didn't break personally.
