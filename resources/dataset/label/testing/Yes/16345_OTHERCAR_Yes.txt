            We bought this camera for the sole purpose of listing things on an online auction site!  Took pics of all of the items and listed them, and made my money that I spent on the camera back in about 2 weeks!

I have taken pictures of everything with this camera.  Clothes, for the auctions.  The kids, indoors and outdoors.  The dog, family members, everything.  I have played my heart out with this thing, and so far I love it.

The great advantage to the camera is that you can look at the picture that you just took on the display screen on the back.  Easily see if it's decent picture or not...and if not...just delete it.  Don't waste your time, paper, or disk space with pictures that are no good!  Also, if you are willing to invest in some photo quality paper, and you have a good printer...you could save TONS on film and developing costs!  Or, there are some internet sites who you can e mail your pictures to, and they will send you the finished product!  Imagine the possibilities. <br><br>
