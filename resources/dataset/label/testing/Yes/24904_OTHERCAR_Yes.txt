            This car is the last of the 2nd generation 7 series, before the body was reshaped in 1994.

A fantastic car.  My car is now 9 years old, and it looks like its only 3.  Not sure what BMW does to its paint, but it still gleens after all these years.

You would buy on the basis that you want a performance luxury car, but you are not interested in forking out the megabucks upfront for a new luxury car, and you are prepared to invest time or money in the upkeep of such a complex car.  To enjoy this car you need to keep it in good condition.

Once in good condition, the drivetrain is pure joy.  Want to drive it like a limo, try 110km/h at 2,000 revs.  The engine is not even trying.  Need to beat somebody at the lights, 0-100 km/h in under 8 seconds.  The accelerator has a special detent position (push the pedal ALL the way to the floor) where the transmission drops a gear, and only changes gears at 6,000 rpm.  Handles more like a sports car than like a big luxury car.

On the inside, you'll find an autodimming rear view mirror, power adjusted front seats, front seat arm-rests, full leather and wood trim, split thermostatically controlled air conditioning, rear window blinds (including side windows), 10 speaker hi-fi system, electronic engine management system and the like.

As mentioned watch the maintenance.  If buying, and you find an interior accessory broken, don't buy the line "it's nothing", it's at least US$100 to replace any item (the power seats can cost US$1,000 ea. to repair).  Get someone trusted to get the drivetrain and suspension all checked, especially the front suspension, which can really breakdown if not looked after.

Then be prepared to maintain the vehicle.  Say every 2nd year, expect to spend approx. US$1,500 for major repairs.
