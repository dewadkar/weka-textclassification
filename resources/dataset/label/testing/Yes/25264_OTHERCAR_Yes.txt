            As in the past few years, today seems like a very good time to lease/buy a Nissan product.  The quality of their products remain strong and, due to soft sales, the incentives and aggressiveness of their salesmen should bode well for your bottom line.

About a month ago, we leased our 3rd Altima GXE in the past six years.  If past experience is any indication, the next 39 months should be smooth sailing.

This year's edition has changed marginally from our last model (1998). New in our package this time around is a useful keyless entry and security system, easy to reach overhead lights for the driver, power seats, power locks on BOTH front doors, a neat sunglass compartment above the rear view mirror, digital odometer and an antennae built into the windshield (a real godsend for those of us who've lost them in carwashes!).  Come to think of it, it has changed quite a bit! And all for the better.

Particularly for the money, the new Altima appears to be a very good buy.  Although it has only been one month for us in the new model, I'm anticipating another 3 years of worry-free and enjoyable driving.<br><br>
