            I never would have considered a mini van until I drove this van by Oldsmobile.  We had always driven Suburbans, Cadillacs, and had always sort of looked down our noses at minivans, but this van is great.  Quiet ride, good handling, good mechanics, and not horrible to look at.  Best of all is the integrated entertainment center.  My wife was adamantly opposed to this feature, but after my persuading her to try it, she loves it too.  Believe me, I enjoy having conversations with my children, and by and large I think they're pretty well-behaved, but I also enjoy some quiet time in a vehicle, and the VCR/TV provides just that.<br><br>
