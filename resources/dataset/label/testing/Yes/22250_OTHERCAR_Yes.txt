            Great things really can come in small packages. I have always been a huge BMW fan my whole life.  I've always loved the Z3 ever since it first came out, and I have to say, this car is worth absolutely every penny.
This car is absolutely wonderful.  The appearance is sleek and sexy and I could not have even dreamed for a more beautiful design, and I highly recommend checking out the teal blue color.
This car gets even better moving into the drivers seat.  THe first thing I noticed was that this car is definately not cheap.  Beautiful wood finish, leather interior, cd player, great speaker quality are all things you will find when sitting down in this masterpeice.  
Pulling out of the dealership, I was very impressed with this cars drivability. The handling in this car is like no other, and I have never has an easier time driving anything in my life.  Furthermore, the braking is unbelievable.  You can stop on a dime with this car.  Its no wonder Car and Driver Magazine proved the Z3 to have the best braking in its class.  With the Z3, driving becomes fun again, not a chore.  Even gas mileage is very good with this vehicle.
I must warn, taller people should try to chooose a slightly larger car.  I am six two and it is slightly cramped in the drivers seat.  There is the same amount of space in the passenger seat, and thats about it.  The trunk is small, so I would not advise taking any cross country trip, or attempting to load the car up.  

*Bottom line-  BMW pulls through once again with flying colors.  Those interested in pure fun, definately check out the Z3 today.
