            As a man still facing midlife crisis [I'm 48] and having just sold a sweet, red, '95 Nissan 300ZX to a retired [age 63] &quot;car enthusiast&quot;, I went looking for a car that could fill the void that the Z left  and also a car that would be a daily driver, as we were also replacing my wife's '97 Camry XLE. 
My first intuition was to buy a BMW 328CI. Needless to say it had been a lifelong dream of mine to own a Bimmer and now that we were empty nesters I felt the time had come. After a test drive I was sure the 328 was the car car for me. 
But a funny thing happened on the way home to tell my wife about the BMW. I chanced by an Acura dealer and actually looked at the TL 4 door. Thinking we should probably get a more &quot;practical&quot; car I took it out for a  drive and was truly impressed. When I returned to the dealership I was telling the salesman about my beloved 300ZX, how I had just driven a BMW and was now perplexed as the Acura TL made such a favorable impression I wasn't sure what I wanted.
 He then showed me a 3.2CL TYPE S and said &quot;this is the car you are looking for&quot;. I must admit at first glance I was not overwhelmed by the exterior styling. In typical Honda fashion, the car seemed somewhat familiar from the front. But as I made my way around the rear I began to  feel a little more interested in the rest of the car. When I sat inside I was impressed with the sportiness of the bucket seats, the &quot;ergonomically correct&quot; position of all the major controls, and the somewhat &quot;high&quot; seating position. The narrow door glass also struck me as very &quot;un-Honda&quot; like and reminiscent of my first new car, a 1970 Mustang Mach 1.
Then came the test drive. Once out of town where I could stretch it's legs the CL really began to shine. The 260h.p. engine and the 5 speed manu-matic transmission transform this somewhat sedate looking coupe into a Bavarian Butt Kicker! Wow!! Is this thing fun to drive--fast! The structural rigidity of this car is amazing. It's as if it was carved out of a block of titanium.The ride, although firm, is a perfect blend of comfort and sports car like handling, much like the BMW's. And the sound of that engine when your foot is in it is, well, every bit as sweet as the BMW's.
Except for the exterior styling [the BMW is still a timeless beauty] the CL TYPE S beats the 328CI in every seat of the pants catagory. And the amazing thing it does so for almost $10,000.00 less! The car I bought stickered for $30,875 vs. $39,900 for a comparabally equipped 328CI. With Acura's proven reliability and low-cost of ownership I know I'll be a satisfied owner.
In my opinion the only thing that keeps this car from being &quot;perfect&quot; is the lack of a telescopic steering wheel. As a previous owner of several Honda cars the Acura suffers from the same design flaw.  The problem is when a man my height [6'] puts his seat where his legs are comfortable the steering wheel is too far away and your arms feel almost fully extended. If i were able to bring the steering wheel an inch or so closer then truly this would be the &quot;perfect&quot; car!<br><br>
