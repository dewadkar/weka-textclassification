            I purchased this car used in December of 1999 as the third owner. At the time I was driving a large Mercury Grand Marquis and was looking to sell it and buy something more gas economical. I found the car for sale in some local on-line classified ads. The fellow was only asking $900 O.B.O. I called up my sister who said "Buy it! You can't kill the engines on those things." So, I talked the man down to $600 cash and found myself the owner of a 1993 Geo Metro. It's a little 2-door hatchback, only 3 cylinders and doesn't have much get up and go for the hills, but this little green machine can do some major transporting! It now has some 160,000 miles on it. It has been the BEST little vehicle I've ever owned. I've never had a lick of problems with it. Of course, I've had to replace tires, brakes, exhaust, battery, one tie rod, and the radiator bit the dust on the way home from a road trip to Niagra Falls. I change the oil and filter myself ever 3 to 5,000 miles as well as the air filter. This little beauty gets at least 45 miles per gallon, and I hit something like 49 when my boyfriend and I drove from NH to Niagra Falls! After reading some of the reviews (and chuckling) I have to agree there isn't much space for taller people, but I'm relatively short at 5' 4" so don't complain too much. Yeah, it's noisy inside, but you get used to it. The interior light never worked, can't get it to work, and I've read where other owners have experienced the same problem. But hey, when you've only paid $600 for the vehicle, you don't much care about such problems. Also, the driver's side automatic door lock (a pain-in-the-butt!) was always causing a forced opening of the handle which eventually broke causing the springs to burst out in a snake-like bite! Ouch! The first time it happened was to my boyfriend! He went from junk yard to junk yard looking for a replacement only to find that almost every single one of them had a broken driver's side door handle. Apparently everybody else had the same problem, LOL. Well, he finally found one, replaced it, and promptly disconnected the automatic locking wire. It took months for me to get used to opening the door without wincing at the possibility of those springs snapping on my index finger! Now though, my little green jelly bean is beginning to show some rust on the passenger door along the bottom. I've just purchased a 1996 Chevy Blazer but will continue to commute mainly with my Geo Metro (well they are both Chevy products, no?) until it is ready for "Enduro Heaven" (my son has claim on it for that, LOL).
