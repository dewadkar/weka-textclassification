            The Rav4 by Toyota is not only a fun and versatile vehicle, it can also be an economical one as well. The three years in which I drove one were probably the most varied in terms of use I will ever experience. My RAV4 was a two-wheel drive with automatic, a/c, ABS, cd, and some other amenities. Yet, despite the Midwest winters, I never experienced a weather related problem. Snow, ice, rain were no problem. The RAV4 moved through them all with relative ease. The flexibility in rear seat arrangements lent itself to the many different needs that arose. Moving from home to home; taking kids to and from college; picking up building supplies; and just plain old tooling around never disappointed me. On the last long trip through Missouri to Oklahoma, even the fully loaded down RAV4 easily made it up the hills and inclines. The 4 cylinder engine not only delivered sufficient power entering high speed highways, but also delivered outstanding fuel economy at 20+ mpg city and 30+ mpg highway. Repairs? None to speak of in the three years, replaced tires at 50,000 miles, usual brakes, oil changes, etc. No breakdowns or other inconveniences. The only reason I still don't own one- Camry. Bought a new 1999 Camry which I fell in love with. No longer had a need to transport kids to college, etc. See my Camry review.<br><br>
