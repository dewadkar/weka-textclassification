            Good design in body overall except power on switch is not the best.  Flash is fixed and allows only intensity variation. Solid.  The Drop Test. I dropped my camera from a meter hight and it still worked well apart from a few dents. The battery life was very poor but this was attributed to a deign fault that Sony has identified and issued a recall repair notice. Recommend you use as a min 64 to 128 MB Memory Stick.  Photos at higher resolution are best. A bit slow on the shutter time and as such you miss some of the action shots.  The image displayed on the screen is smaller then the image recorded.  Should support Web Cam but doesn't.  The Battery issue is of some concern but Sony has issued an extended warranty upgrade to fix this problem.  One good reason of dealing with a large brand name.  Optional Underwater accessory was also a major consideration
