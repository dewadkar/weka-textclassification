            In a world full of $40,000+ luxury SUVs that no one in their right mind would take off road for fear of nicks and scratches stands a rugged tuff off road vehicle actually built to go off road.  I mean lets face it most of the so called SUVs coming out today are nothing but luxury cars with bad gas mileage.  Even Jeep with its Grand Cherokee is getting way too frilly for a truck that was originally built to take abuse from mud and uneven roads.  Fortunately for everyone who doesn't want to fork over handfuls of cash for a truck made for hauling ass through the woods, Jeep still makes its' original SUV, the Cherokee.  Accept a few for small body changes and a few safety features (e.g. air bags) the Cherokee remains almost unchanged.  After all who can improve on perfection?  I have friends who own some of the earliest Cherokees and their still going strong, and I plan to do the same with mine.<br><br>
