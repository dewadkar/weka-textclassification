            As an avid Jeep enthusiast for the past 10 years, I have to say that I am in love with my '93 Jeep Wrangler.  I owned a '97 Wrangler and an '87 CJ-7 before, but by far and away, my '93 is the best.  I bought my Jeep partly because of the price, I got it for a cool $7500, but with the addition of some 32X11X50 tires, a sound bar, $2000 worth of stereo equipment and amps, some KC lights and SteelHorse Nerf Bars, I'm stylin' and profilin' all around town.

I love the feel of the crisp autumn air in my face as I tool around town with the top down... where I live we don't get much rain.  One of the pitfalls of owning a Jeep however, is that you constantly have to watch the weather channel and you can't forget valuables in your vehicle. (I lost about $1000 worth of CDs out of my '97)

This Jeep handles superbly on road as well as off, though I have to admit I love hunting season with this vehicle as the woods are a lot more fun in a Jeep!!  I HIGHLY recommend this vehicle to ANYONE who likes an adventure.  But if you like a smooth quiet ride, stay away.<br><br>
