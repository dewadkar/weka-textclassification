            Sony Mavica is a good digital camera with an easy to use interface.  The biggest advantage of this camera is the method of storage for the digital images.  All digital data is stored on floppy disks making the transfer of digital image data to the computer a snap.  However, this series of cameras has a significant drawback.

The FD73 depletes its battery charge at a significantly higher rate compared to other digital camera; I believe it is directly related to the incorporation of the floppy disk drive data transfer and storage system that this series of cameras use.  A specific  drawback of the FD-73 is that it does not a have a zoom function and the picture quality is NOT great.

Overall for most users, this camera can do an adequate job to provide digital pictures and the ease of transferring these pictures to a computer via a floppy disk greatly outweighs the drawbacks of these cameras.<br><br>
