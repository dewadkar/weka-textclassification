            I just test drove a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder... 4x4... LE package... all available options.  It has major improvements over the 2000 model.

First of all, the engine has been beefed up to a whopping 240hp (250 manual trans.).  The bigger engine is the most impressive new feature. The extra power is VERY impressive and the engine is MUCH quieter.  The next thing that excited me was the in-dash CD changer by Bose, which held 6 CD's.  Like another post... the Bose stereo is unmatched.  It also has a new dash design and instrument gauges.  Memory seats, homelink, automatic headlights, digital climate control, steering wheel audio controls are all on the 2001.

I have had a 94 and a 98 model and plan to get a 2001 within the next 6-8 months (waiting on lease to terminate).  I have been a big NISSAN fan for years and can honestly say the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder is one SUV that is hard to beat... and I have no job-related affiliation w/ Nissan.

I test drove a 2001 w/ every available option.  My 98 model has every available option... AND THE PRICE IS $800 LOWER ON THE 2001 MODEL!!! UNREAL!<br><br>
