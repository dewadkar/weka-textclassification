            My 1995 Jimmy and I have shared many firsts.  First car to drive, first club driven to, first girlfriend, first speeding ticket, etc.  Not only is Jimmy a solid TRUCK, but after a few thousand miles... it rides like a car.  I've beat the hell out of this thing and it takes everything I give it.  I mean off roading, flat tires, racing, speeding, even punctured the manifold on the exhaust and I didnt notice it until i was changing the oil.

GMC outdid themselves with the Jimmy, and it has alot over it's Chevrolet counterpart, the Blazer.  It's the subtle differences that makes the GMC a better truck to drive.  Things like a more reliable transmission, more stability, and solid-steel chassis frame and roll cage.  

And a personal note... remember the hurricane Floyd?  I was driving on the highway in this mess (in NY no less) and I lost control in a small pond that had formed on the road.  I shot up onto the median and did more donuts that a cop working a double shift.  I'm not going to lie, I thought this truck was going to flip and roll the rest of the way to school.  Not even close!!!  My car not only stayed on its feet, I was able to control it a little and regained full control, preventing me having a hood ornament in the shape of a guardrail.

PEACE!!<br><br>
