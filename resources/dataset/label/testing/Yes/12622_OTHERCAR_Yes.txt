            i highly recommend people to get this camera.I had a hard time with all the other camera's i've bought but this one really comes in handy.First of all it's a small camera which can be put anywhere like in your pocket.This is great so you don't have to carry it around all the time. Also the pictures come out very clear and if you don't like the way it looks you can delete the picture and try again. With other camera's you'd have to wait till after you payed for the film to be developed to get back pictures that came out horrible. I've had that experience with one of the camera's i used on vacation. i expected my pictures to come out great but after i got them back they came out blurry or to much to the side.

With the canon digital you get clear shots and you won't have to worry about getting back bad pictures.Another thing that's good about this camera is that you can transfer pictures from the camera to a scanner on the computer. For example, my brother just had a baby and i have an aunt that lives in California. What we did was put the pictures from the digital onto the scanner and sent them to her through e-mail. All in less then a few hours.
