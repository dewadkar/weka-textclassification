            Now that the kids are all grown up and made their first millions during the booming days of dotcom or the New Economy, their mother can pamper herself.  And why not?  It's time for her to start cashing out a little bit.  Mary (not the real name of the person I am writing about)lived a roller coaster type of a life during her marriage to the father to her two sons.  She decided she wanted to put an end to all the cheating, drinking, cyber cheating, lying, and put downs by her loser former husband.  She wanted to start anew and create a future for her and children.  She returned to school to get a master's in Organizational Management.  And that was her ticket out of poverty!  Having worked for a great number of years putting her sons through school, investing and saving her money, she managed to purchase something she wanted for herself.

Mary had made her share of profits last year.  Her sons had given her some great tips which she used carefully to invest her money.  This past May, she bought a <b>2001 Cheverolet Tahoe, her dream vehicle</b>.  Last month, she surprised all of us, her friends with her red truck.  I looked at her face and observed her happiness.  It's the fruit of all her efforts.  Once for all, she put aside or forgot about all the tribulations she had been through in her professional and marriage life.  A look at the Tahoe shows that it is very spacious.  I appreciated it more when we all went to lunch together.  On the way back to the office, Mary let me drive her truck.  It is so comfortable that I just wished that the distance was longer.  I like the way its instrument panel is set.  Everything is at the driver's reach.  Being in the beginning of the Summer heat in the Valley, we had the AC on.  It cooled off the truck in no time.  The second row seat passengers, no matter how big and tall they are, can be pretty comfortable.  And there is so much space in the back.  Whether you want to use it for cargo or for other reasons, you can take your pick!  
 
<b>Competitors don't stand too much of a chance in front of the 2001 Chevrolet design</b>

Some of the 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe's competitors include the 200 Dodge Durango, 2000 Grand Jeep Cherokee, 2001 Nissan Xterra, 2001 Ford Expedition, 2000 Ford Excursion and its sister truck, the GMC Yukon.  No matter what they are, the Tahoe stands on its own ground.  It's been commanding lots of respect from the industry.  More and more people are attracted to it.  They perceive it as being a well-built truck that will last a few decades.  Others want it because it is luxurious and spots this flashy, great look.  <b>The 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe comes equipped with a Vortec V-8 engine. </b> It has all the standard features.  Some of the new changes include improved fuel economy, power and emissions, On-Star system, theft deterrent system, child security etc.

If you want class, luxury and comfort, you will find all of these features in the 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe.  On the road, fellow drivers will take a second look at your vehicle.  It does have presence, not something bulky like a Ford Expedition or Ford Excursion.  The Tahoe is the right vehicle for the working single mother, the working parent who still has kids around the house.  It looks safe and reliable.  I never felt insecure, unsafe when I drove it.  If a single mother, an educated one, can raise her kids to be successful economically, take care of her home and pamper herself with a Tahoe, you can do it too.

And why not after all?  It's just a matter of being qualified creditwise.  If you are on the market for a strong, reliable truck that can pull your trailer, your boat to the nearby lake for a weekend of fun with the family and friends, the Tahoe is waiting for your knock!
