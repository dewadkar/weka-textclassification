            I wanted a Honda Accord V6 Coupe, but the Honda dealer was so rude to me that I went to the Nissan dealer and ended up purchasing a Maxima instead.  I felt like a got a lot more car for my money.    

I bought it in 2000 used.  So far, the only problem that I have had with this vehicle is the starter.  I replaced the starter myself for $140 at AutoZone.  It was very simple to replace.  Both of my front struts and strut bearings have been replaced.

Other than the starter and front struts, the engine is flawless and smooth.  Reliability is excellent.  The engine runs incredible and still has a lot of power after almost 70k miles.  

Although I can't complain about the engine or transmission, the car does have a lot of squeaks.  It seems like the interior panels all have their own type of sqeak or rattle each time I hit a bump.

The car doesn't handle as well as the honda Accord Coupe that I almost bought, but I can live with it.  It might handle better with "V" rated tires.

The vehicle is great on long highway trips.

Maintenance is very easy on this vehicle.  Oil changes can be done in the driveway without even lifting the vehicle with a jack.  The belts were easy to change as well as the radiator hoses other maintenance items.  

Gas Mileage: 23 city / 26 highway (AutoTransmission)
gas mileage with A/C on in the city: 19 mpg.

If I bought this vehicle again, I would get a 5-speed or the new 6-speed Maxima SE.  As the transmission ages, it feels like a lot of the power is lost through the trasmission.
