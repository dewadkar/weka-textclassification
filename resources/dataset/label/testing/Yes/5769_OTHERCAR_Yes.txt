            I still can�t decide if I should despise or whole-heartedly embrace sport utility vehicles.  For the longest time I have been an ardent car person.  �Trucks are for hauling stuff,� I�d say.  �Only rednecks drive trucks,� was my anti-truck anthem.  While it may still be true that rednecks drive trucks, you�d also have to add moms, salespeople, yuppies, and multi-millionaires to the list of truck owners.  Let�s be honest, trucks have changed.  Show me a truck with soft leather seats and a CD player, and I can show you 10 rednecks with college degrees. 

The Mitsubishi Montero Sport is a truck.  Despite its car like qualities, it is still a truck.  Inside the Montero Sport is a very inviting interior.  I am not a big fan of faux wood trim, but in  the Montero�s case it does make the inside a little more inviting. The manual seats are firm and lack the luxury of the Chevrolet Tahoe. Also, for $32,000 I expect power seats.  Extended trips in the Montero Sport proved to be average in comfort.   Rear seats have plenty of room, and back seat passengers have their own fan and heat controls- perfect for a ski trip.  Storage space in the front part of the cabin is a little sparse, but still adequate for the usual wallet, phone, and a few CD�s. Controls are well placed, easy to understand and can be reached without too much of a reach for the driver.  Switchgear feels solid and sturdy, but there is a lot of plastic. Rear cargo storage area is large enough for most families, and seems to hold more �stuff� than the similarly price Toyota 4-Runner.  In fact, the 4-Runner�s interior feels much smaller overall.  The rear cargo area of the Montero Sport, has several panels and hidden storage areas, and includes some very useful plastic dividers that extend the utility of the Montero.

Speaking of utility, the Montero Sport�s rear seats are easy to configure in several different positions (60/40 split with an armrest).  Again the Montero falls short of the benchmark Tahoe, but the Tahoe is considerably more expensive when equipped similarly to the Montero Sport Limited.  The genius of the Tahoe�s flip back head rests when laying the seats flat is all the more noticeable when re-arranging the Montero�s back seats.  When all is said and done, you are left holding a headrest, and wondering what to do with it.  Even the lowly Suzuki Vitara has slots that hold the headrests in place when the back seats are folded down.

On the road the Montero Sport barely feels like a truck.  While the ride is certainly not car-like, it is rather pleasant and smooth.  Large dips or bumps in the road tend to reveal the Montero�s truck roots.  Acceleration is better than average, and the 3.5L V-6 does its job with virtually no noise vibration or harshness.  Because of its height, the Montero does not instill  one with confidence during hard swerves � it never feels unstable,  but there is quite a bit of lean when cornering hard.  Brakes are firm and bring the Montero Sport to a quick stop.  At highway speed there is little road noise, and the semi-aggressive tires cause only a slight unpleasantness.  The Montero Sport lacks the perfect isolation from the road found in many Toyota cars and trucks, but is about 5 times more refined than most Nissan trucks. The automatic transmission shifts up with little drama, but downshifts are noticeable and seem to come at odd intervals.  When driving in moderate surface street traffic at about 30-40 mph the Montero�s transmission feel rather clunky, often hunting for the right gear.  

Overall the 2001 Montero Sport is a reasonably competent SUV. It is not a luxury SUV, but comes very close (for $32,000 it should come closer) - not too big, but big enough to be useful to a family of 4.  Ride quality, fit and finish, and overall attractiveness is near that of the Toyota 4-Runner, although the 4-Runner has more towing capacity.  Even though I complain about the $32,000 price for the Montero Sport Limited, it is important to remember that the 4-Runner Limited is about $3000 more and gives you 10 fewer horsepower. Both have 6/60,000 power-train warranties, and both are very good looking. Mitsubishi has an 84 month corrosion warranty, while Toyota�s is 60 months.  The major difference between the Montero (or any Mitsubishi) and a Toyota is resale value.  Mitsubishi vehicles simply do not hold their value as well as Toyotas � like the saying goes, you can pay now or you can pay later. 

Compare the Montero Sport to:

Jeep Grand Cherokee   - Cherokee offer slightly more luxury
Suzuki XL-7       -           Unproven reliability, maybe good for those on a budget.
Toyota 4-Runner  -          Very Similar
Nissan Pathfinder    -       Not as refined
