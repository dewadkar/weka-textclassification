            My family has been crusing (well driving at least) around in our 95' Dodge Caravan for years.  We don't positivly love the thing and we have to oil it up every once in a while, but it gets us where we wanna go!  The Dodge Caravan has leg room ( a big + in my case! ), nice tinted windows, great handling, good acceleration, and it will only break down on you if you've had the thing for 20 years!  It's not a gas hog either.

From work to school to football games, this Van get's us there safely, and in one piece.  A bargain if I ever saw one.  Hop in.

Happy Driving!<br><br>
