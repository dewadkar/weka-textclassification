            My husband and I recently purchased a 2000 Camry.  We knew that we wanted to get another Toyota since we would be trading in our 1990 Corolla with 160,000 miles on it and very few problems over the time we owned it.  With the wonderful experience we had owning the Corolla we knew we could never own anything other than a Toyota.

The reason we bought the Camry as opposed to another Corolla was size.  We wanted to have a midsize car so that we would have plenty of room for our growing children.  We know that this is a car we will own for many years!  The Camry has lots of leg room and is extremely comfortable to ride in.

The Camry has an excellent record for being dependable, actually all Toyotas do.  We knew this and it was one factor in buying this car.  So, since I have not had time to experience any problems let me tell you about some of the features that come standard with the Camry.

We purchased the 2000 Camry LE (this is the middle of the line Camry).  Our Camry is a beautiful silver called Lunar Mist. It came standard with a CDplayer, power windows, locks, seats, cruise control.  This car has the works.  You can of course upgrade and get some of the other more fancy features like a sunroof or the wood paneling.  

The car rides very smoothly and handles well, although I must admit I tend to drive like Grandma  now that I have children.  

If you purchase this car you definitely want to get an alarm, whether you have Toyota install it or someone else, because these cars are a favorite amongst thieves.  

I highly recommend the Camry or any other Toyota, as they are one of the best built and most dependable cars around.  <br><br>
