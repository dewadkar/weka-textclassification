            Two weeks before an early delivery of my son, my wife and I decided that we wanted a digital camera so we could share our baby's first moments online to family members.  At the time we made the purchase, we didn't have much money, so this is the digital camera we chose.  We really liked that it would hold 64 pictures.  It was fun to see that we could take a picture and see immediately what the picture was.  At the time of purchase we didn't realize how important this feature would be to us.

When my son was born, he had troubles breathing.  The only view of our son that my wife got was when he suddenly turned blue and they started CPR.  He was quickly wisked off to a hospital over an hour away.  I took several pictures of him before they left.  I travelled back and forth between the two hospitals for three days while my wife recovered from a c-section and baby struggled to live.  That camera, and it's instant pictures, was an invaluable link between mommy and baby.

Some of the specifics about the camera are:  24 bit color, JPEG compression, 320x240 pixel resolution, and ISO 200 speed.

The camera came with all of  the stuff I would need to get started, so I didn't have to do any more running around.  It included a great instruction guide with an easy to use trouble shooting guide, and AC adapter and cord, serial cable, video cable, carrying strap, and some fun photo software.

The one thing that we didn't like about it was the rate at which the batteries were drained!  We invested in some rechargeable batteries, which I am sure saved us lots of money in the long run.<br><br>
