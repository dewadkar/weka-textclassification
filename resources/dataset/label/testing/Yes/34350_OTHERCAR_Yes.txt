            I brought my 1990 Corrado in 1990, brand spanking new with 8 miles on it.  I have never had a problem with this car except normal maintenance such as new struts, batteries, and replacing the water hoses after almost 10 years of use!  Granted since I brought the car new, I know how its been driven.  If you take care of these cars, just like any other car, it will reward you.  The problem with many used Corrados that they are beat.  The bodies are dented, and the engines have been raced as well as the chargers blown.  By the way, my car was one of the first Corrados to run the Stage 2 kit from Autoauthority back in 1991.  The supercharger is still going strong.  As a matter of fact, I have since taken it off and replaced it with a RS version of the supercharger.  The car performs flawlessly.   I have had some other mods completed and it will beat the doors off a VR6, I know I also own a VR6!  As a matter of fact, there are fews cars that will beat it.  Do I recommend this car?  Yes by all means, but shop around for a well taken care example.  Its just like shopping for a used Mustang or Firebird, there are a few examples which haven't been driven hard.  The down side to this car are that parts are not cheap, but then how many Corrados have you counted on the road in the last week? Not many.  Like any other limited production car, be prepared to pay for parts when something does break.<br><br>
