              I am not an automotive expert, but I am an expert at doing my homework before making a purchase  .  I took a long hard look at what was out there, and am thrilled with the results of my efforts: my nifty , new, 2001 Honda CR-V.

  I will not bore you with technological statistics.  I am here to present a simple summary of why I feel this car is just the best thing to come down the pike in a while.

  Years ago I bought the fancy cars.. I had my Mercedes, I even had several of those "disposable " American made cars, the kind you replace every three years and hope you get 20 bucks for when you sell them.  Then I discovered Honda ,, by the recommendation of, imagine this, my mechanic ..He told if I bought a Honda he would never see me again ,,and he didn't ,, I got my first Honda, a 1982 Accord, and I never looked back.  I have owned Accords, an Acura Integra, a Prelude,  another Accord ( a 1992 station wagon ) and now the CR-V .

  I recently relocated back to the land of ice and snow, Connecticut, after years in the California sunshine.  Of course I had to purchase a home with a driveway like a ski slope to get the best view.  Everyone who came immediately said " How are you going to get up that driveway in the winter ?  DUH, Why didn't I think of that ?  My first winter here I slid down the driveway and across the road into the neighbors yard.  Other times I made futile attempts to get up the driveway until I nearly ran out of gas ..Most nights I just took my chances parking on the road, and prayed to the snowplow gods that I only found 3 feet of snow pushed up against my car when it was time to leave for work the next morning.  I decided to bite the bullet and join the SUV craze.

  Starting doing my homework.. Read everything.  Drove everything.  Talked to everyone.  Bought me a CR-V.

  OK, OK, ,,, it ain't gonna turn heads like a Lexus RX300.  I cannot accelerate like the speed of light as the Acura MDX can .and lets face it ,, its not the fancy BMW SUV , . but I didn't have to re-finance my house either to get another vehicle .. At the top of the line, SE edition I got out of a dealership with every bell and whistle, including a security system, and a leather interior for about $23k ..

  I drove some of the competition: the Vitara ( ha ha ha ), and the Rav 4 by Toyota. The Rav 4 was cool, stylish and handled well, but was too small.  Another annoying thing about it was that the rear seats did not fold down, they can only be removed ,so if you went someplace and saw that stuffed moose head that you couldn't live without, and you had your seats with you, you were out of luck .

  The CR-V has plenty of room, for stuff, or four full sized adults.  Everyone that has been in the car has commented on the room, head room, legroom. The rear seats recline, an important feature on long trips with grumpy passengers.  The leather interior is snappy and stylish, the sound system fine, the keyless entry quite nice and the little hooks to hold plastic grocery bags from becoming flying objects on the way home: a nice touch.

  The horsepower has been.increased this year and is perfectly fine for me and my travels , I can cruise above speed limit ( don't tell ), with ease and have been averaging about 22-24 MPG.  I read it was a little noisy on the road, and agree,,especially when trying to go up a steep hill, so I just put the volume up a bit and deal with it. I read that the power window controls were in an odd place,,on the dashboard, rather than the  driver's door .. I mastered that adjustment in about 5 seconds. With adjustable seats with good support, I find it easy to drive.. and my back feels just fine after a long day in the saddle.

  They just came out with the SE edition, well worth it.  If you were to buy the LX version and begin to add on, it would cost more.  It came with leather interior, the rear tire hard cover, a CD player, and some fancy trim on the front, that truthfully only other CR-V owners would notice.

  Don't expect to get a great bargain on this vehicle. But then again ,, you can resell this baby for almost what you paid for it. Honda knows that. and so do the dealers. or you can just keep it for years and years, like most Honda owners, only having to buy gas, tires and oil, . Honda reliability is outstanding.

  Easy to park, fun to drive, plenty of room, cheap to operate., nice colors available, good sound system,

   When the snows came and the moment of truth arrived, I just zipped up and down that drive way with ease. It has what they call  REAL TIME 4 wheel drive ,,,whenever the wheels feel they need to they shift into operation they just do it.  You may be in only 2 wheel drive,, maybe 3 wheel or 4 wheel ,,You never know, but you don't have to shift or think about it either ,,in my mind, a dream car.. I drove thru 6" of slush and snow easily . This is not your tough off road vehicle .. but then again, my " off road " adventures can be summed up by parking on someone's lawn at a picnic..it suits me just fine

  Since I was buying my first new car in 9 years, I was a little disappointed that it looked so much like last year's and the year before's model .  Honda generally changes their body styles every few years ,, and I am certain they will now change it ..But  I know I can always sell it ..people are lined up to get a used one.  another good point.

 And if I decide to open my own ski slope on my driveway next year, I know I can get back up to the lodge
