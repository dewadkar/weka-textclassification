            I bought my 2000 Mustang after a bad experience with a Contour.  I have always owned Fords and would not let one bad experience prevent me from buying another.  Although I did not fancy myself a sports car driver, the Mustang ended up the perfect car for this 41 year old female.  The 3.8 Liter 6 cylander engine gives you just the right power to pull onto the Interstate and rides smooth enough on the highway to make you think you are in a Sedan.  The 2000 body style is very classy and the price can not be beat.  Who should buy a Mustang?  Anyone between the ages of 18 and 80.  It's the best &quot;Pony&quot; car around and the 2000 model is the closest thing to the classic 1960's model. Ford hit this one right.<br><br>
