            I did a lot of research as my trustworthy 1988 Toyota Corolla with 150000 miles was on it's way to car heaven.  The safety of a Volvo is well known.  I wanted a dependable car, like my Toyota, that would last forever.  So my choices were few.  I wanted a lot of quality with a small budget, so I had to go used.  I researched and researched and came up with the Volvo 1991 740.  

Let me tell you, this is the best car I have owned.  I got it a year ago with 70,000 miles and it drove like a new car.  The door are shut solid.  The engine purrs like a kitten.  I live outside of New York City,, and I take this car on demanding roads and she is great.  I have almost 95,000 miles a year later, and not a single problem.

The interior is clean and simple, typical for Scandanavian design.  For every compartment, and there are many, there is a perfectly placed light.  No drink holders,,,,for us Americans!  But other great features,, like the lights turn off with the car, you can't lock your keys in the car.  The car is just a great egonomically. 

The only thing,, is that the car has some sway on corners, but what do you expect for a big heavy car?

A great road trip car.  The car can also tow a lot,, over 3,000 pounds.  The trunk goes on forever...


Every time I drive the car,, I can't believe she is 10 years old.  I know my partner must be tired of me saying it too!!

I found the car at Yahoo Classifieds.  I only paid $5000 for this car, realizing I got a great deal.  The Blue Book value was much higher.  I realize I could have paid 3 grand more for the same vehicle.  I bought this car from a private individual who really didn't realize its worth.  Lucky me!
  
The other great think is that I have put 25,000 miles on the car and the value has not really changed much.  I check the blue book value every once and a while and it really hasn't dropped much.  (We have a Suzuki and we put about 5,000 miles a year on it and the blue book keeps falling at a much faster rate.)
