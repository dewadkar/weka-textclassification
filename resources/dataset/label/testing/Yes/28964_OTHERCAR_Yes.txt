            Wifey-poo and I decided to take a week and head to Vegas in March '01, and after some deliberation, figured we would rent a car for the whole week.  Since I had been in Vegas before and knew my way around, I though it would be wise to avoid the high taxi rates.

We rented from Payless Rental at the Vegas airport (good little chain, friendly and efficient).  I had originally secured a Taurus, but was informed that they had run out (it was late in the afternoon), and that the equivalent of their other mid-size offering was the Hyundai Sonata.  I shivered, but thought, "heck, it's only a week."

Preface
-----------------------------------------------------------
I will first start off the review by stating that I am not a big Hyundai fan.  After spending a year in the industry, it was learned that Hyundai was Korean for "mediocre."  Notoriously bad at resale values, build quality, and fit-and-finish, I wasn't expecting much.  I do keep up with the industry at a rapid pace, and have noticed that the company has invested a great deal of effort in revitalizing their image as a Honda and Toyota fighter.  We'll see...


The Car Itself
-----------------------------------------------------------
We were given a 2000 Sonata with the 4-cylinder engine, cloth interior, moonroof, CD player, power windows and locks, tilt, cruise, and A/C.  Silver exterior (nice), with alloy wheels.
The odometer read right at 9,700 when we picked her up.


Engine
-----------------------------------------------------------
A pleasant little surprise.  Although I would have preferred a V6 (even though the term "Korean muscle" doesn't mean much to me), the 4-cylinder did fine for putting around Vegas.
As far as 4-bangers go, it had good take-off power, lacked a little midrange, merged decently with traffic, but wouldn't be recommended if you needed to pass in a hurry.  I never had any "musclecar smile" on my face, but I never griped about not having enough go-go.
The transmission was a 4-speed auto, and was a little rough if it needed to shift under any speed.  But for everyday driving, it was smooth enough for me.  It clicked into gear solidly and felt stable.


The Driving Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Sonata is a nimble little urban warrior.  U-turns were a breeze on The Strip, and parking was easy, thanks to the good turning-radius.  The cheap Kumho tires, however, would squeal if pushed hard at all.  
The car itself had a good little ride, that reminded me of Accords I had driven.  It was plenty plush for any little jaunt we took out of town, and was still supple enough in town.


Interior
-----------------------------------------------------------
Here is where Hyundai has its work cut out.  Fit-and-finish is still below par, and some of the trim was coming loose from around the dash.  It felt and looked cheap.  To their credit, Hyundai has gone with the "flowing stack" design in the dash console (A/C, radio), and it works well.  Nothing was blocked by the shifter (a big pet peeve of mine), and controls were intuitive and easy to learn.  The turn indicator lever was just the right size.  Controls for the moonroof were dead-on as well.  If they could just do something about the fit-and-finish, they could earn a little more trust.
The seats were comfy, and I had plenty of range of movement in order to fit my frame under the moonroof-equipped interior.  I had plenty of headroom for my 6'4" height, and legroom was surprisingly ample.  Lumbar support lacked, and it was evident on longer drives, but my wife said hers was fine.  


The Hyundai "Scowl"
-----------------------------------------------------------
You know what I'm talking about... the scowl given by most Americans when someone mentions they bought a Hyundai.  I was expecting this same look from the valets when we pulled up in our little rental.  Surprisingly, we actually received compliments (I'm still in therapy for that).  The slick silver was a head-turner at traffic lights, and after awhile, my initial shame of driving a Hyundai went away.  I even stopped telling valets that it was a rental...


The Verdict
-----------------------------------------------------------
I have to admit, I have changed my thinking on Korean upstart.  They have come a long way from the tin cans they used to put out.  Although resale value is still below par and they need to give some more lectures to the guys on the interior assembly line, the car felt solid enough for me to actually hate to see it go when it rejoined the fleet.

Is the Sonata up to Camry's and Accord's standards???  Not quite yet.  But every year, they gain another foot.  With the 10-year powertrain warranty Hyundai is gambling on (remember the cash Chrysler lost with the "7/70" protection??), buyers are becoming more and more trusting.

And I know that the little silver car that faithfully carried my wife and I around Vegas for a week is probably making another doubter smile.
