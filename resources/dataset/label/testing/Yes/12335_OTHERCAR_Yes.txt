            After lose of ground to the newly introduced, Mercury Cougar, Mitsubishi has decided its Eclipse coupe is in need of a personality change. The hard-edged sportiness of the old Eclipse is gone, in favor of a more made, mature example of a grand touring coupe. Mitsubishi claims it wants to find older buyers for its new coupe.

<b>Engine</b>
Mitsubishi has cut back on the performance and handling of the car, in order to make a more comfortable and well manuverable vehicle. An example is, that they have not turbo charged this auto-motive and makes the V-6 engine less powerful. Because of this the former GS-T could reach 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, the new V-6 engine will get you there in 7.3 seconds. The Mitsubishi-built 2.4-liter engine has taken place of the former Chrysler 2.0-liter four cylinder which displays a quieter with a more refined character.

<b>Looks</b>
The new Eclipse is very different from the old model. On the outside, the Eclipse has changed into classier, more expensive-looking sheetmetal. Mitsubishi looked similar to the Cougar as its benchmark, but some of the styles can even be traced to Ferrari models. The new design should help the Mitsubishi be very different from the original design to the buyers its searching for. Do not be fooled, this car is still unmistakably an Eclipse.
