            Now after 20,00 miles, my wife still loves her Jetta. She became a stay at home mom just after the last review,and has driven the care every day doing errands and going to ballet, gymnastics, school, you get the picture.Mostly around town driving with very little highway driving. The car has been flawless, no problems, still the great fuel efficiency, no breakdowns or major complaints. It heats up really fast in the winter, heated seats are a plus.

The air conditioner doesn't seem to effect the engine in the summer, cools great without significant change in fuel efficiency (no woman will drive with the window down too much hair mussing!).

Now the complaints, the dash cupholders cover the stereo so you can't see it, needs to be re-designed. Of course there's not a lot of room inside for the bags of "mom stuff" hauled around with the 5 year old.

Had a major hurricane some months ago and while the lines were long at the gas station for gasoline, we had no problem with filling up the Jetta. Although diesel prices seem to climb toward fall/winter, we only fill it up once a month even with all the in-town driving.

Still a keeper!! Glad we have it.
