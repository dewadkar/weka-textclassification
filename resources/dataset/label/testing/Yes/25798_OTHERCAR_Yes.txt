            I used Epinions when I was looking into buying this car in January of 2003... and truthfully, everything you read here is true:  it *is* a dentmobile, something inside the car on the passenger side rattles, it shifts gears noisily, BUT it's an EXCELLENT car for the value, and it's sexy, good on gas and handles well.  I can't say enough about this car... I love it.  It's my first car where the doors match the hood (in other words, my first real car outside of a beater), and I am proud to own it.  I paid $8500 Canadian for it, and have probably put about $1000 into it in 10 months: new tires, two CV boots, a broken windshield wiper motor and resevoir (my fault: ran over a tree stump), stereo.  It came with 119,000 KM on it, and I just cracked 140,000 KM 10 months later.

Actually, the stereo is an issue unto itself.  The cup holder is badly placed if you need to use the lighter to charge your cell phone (which I do) so I'd bought a cup holder that screwed onto the vent.  One day, coffee spilled and must have gone down the vent, and in behind and fried the stereo connectors.  I could smell burning plastic badly, and the tape deck (genuine Mazda part) died a miserable death.  I thought that was weird -- that spilled coffee could fry a tape deck, but hey, now I know.  I have a nice swanky CD player now... LOL

Another issue is that it stalls periodically on a cold start.  I don't get this; I took it to the dealership and $300 later they told me nothing is wrong.  Whatever.  Sometimes you have to turn the ignition and give it gas, and throw it into gear right away to prevent stalling.

Overall, despite the little things, this car ROCKS for being almost 7 years old, and I just can't get over how good it looks.  I see them on the road sometimes, and from a distance, I think it's a Jag.  HA!
