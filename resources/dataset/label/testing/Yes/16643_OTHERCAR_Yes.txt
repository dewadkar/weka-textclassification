            We recently purchased a 2001 Hyundai Tiburon and have not regretted our purchase for one second. Although we have a toddler, my husband and I figured that we already had a mini-van and that it would make a great second car for us. While it does have a small interior, the front seats are roomy. My husband is 6'1" and is very comfortable driving it. Surprisingly enough, the rear seat accommodates our son in his car seat quite nicely too.

When we first test drove the Tiburon, we tried the automatic transmission and we weren't impressed with it. But, once we each got behind the wheel of the manual transmission version, we were hooked. The manual transmission has great pick up and just made the car feel so much more like a "sports" car.

We also weren't impressed with the cloth seats. They are black with red stitching that looks very cheap. However, the leather package was very attractive and also very affordably priced. Fully loaded, with leather, sun-roof and a cd-player, our top of the line Tiburon was a steal! 

My husband is on the road a lot for his job and puts a lot of mileage on his cars. Another key factor in choosing the Tiburon was Hyundai's warranty. Their warranty far exceeds those offered by other car manufacturers.

Overall, we are very much still in love with our Tiburon and highly recommend it.
