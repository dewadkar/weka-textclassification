                First off I think you have to establish just what constitutes a &quot;sports car&quot;.  Many manufacturers have lost sight of the fact that sports car of yesteryear weren't meant to be so called &quot;practical&quot; vehicles. The fact that they were impractical is part of what made them &quot;sporting&quot; in the first place. Most of todays so called sports cars are really GT ( Grand Touring } cars. 

    Mazda has returned to the basics with its Miata and what they have given us is pure unadulterated FUN. Miata's are not for everyone and if this is going to be your only mode of transportation on a year round basis I hope you live in a sunny climate. In my case our Miata (a 97) is our third vehicle, shared by my wife and myself. 

     Our Miata has been a great fun little sports car. We've owned it for four years now and it hasn't been back  to the shop once for repairs. Oil changes every 3,000mi. are the only service our Mazda has seen in 24,000mi. of driving fun. 

      I've owned sports cars since I bought my first car, a 1960 Austin-Healy back in 1970. Since that time I've owned about 10 other sports car or sport (GT) cars, Alfa Romeo's, Porsche's, Fiats, and BMW's. Many were great cars, some less than great. But my Miata just seems to have the perfect blend of what makes a sports car great. It makes all the right sounds, handles beautifully, stops on a dime, never breaks down, 28 mpg.Its top goes up in 30 seconds, no leaks,no flapping, no rear window defroster(oops!) well I never said it was perfect or did I.

     My only complaint asides from the lack of a rear defroster is when the top goes up things begin to get a little claustrophobic. But then again that's why they built this car with a top that goes down. If you don't love wind in your face motoring then by all means don't buy this car. But if you're the type that even on the colder days would prefer to just crank up the heat, zip up your old bomber jacket and put the top down, the Miata might just be your perfect ride.<br><br>
