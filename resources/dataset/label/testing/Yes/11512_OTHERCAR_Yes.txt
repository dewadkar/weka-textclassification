            Not too long ago, I parted ways with my '98 Chevy Lumina.  A terrific car, it accomplished its mission and got me through my poor days of college.  As great as it was, the Chevy was hardly a driving enthusiast's delight.  I have always loved the Nissan Maxima, and when the latest generation with 222 horsepower bowed for 2000, I vowed that once I graduated college I would be owning one shortly after.  I made that dream a reality this year with my purchase of a 2001 Maxima SE, and so far I have no regrets.

For the price, this car is an unbelievable value.  The Maxima's biggest asset is its standard powerplant, the 3.0 liter twin-cam 24-valve V6 with 222 horsepower.  Linked with a crisp 5-speed manual, as is mine, you have yourself an incredibly quick car.  Even the automatic transmission models, in which I have a friend that owns, is nearly as  fast.  This engine is seamless--no matter how hard you punch it, it is quiet and emits and muted and refined growl.  In fact, this engine has been rated as one of America's 10-Best V6 engines by Wards Automotive.  

Besides a terrific powerplant, you get a sporty trunklid spoiler, foglamps, fancy 16-inch 5-star alloy rims, and a terrific sounding AM/FM/cassette/CD stereo with 6 speakers as part of the SE package.  Even the lesser GXE is well equipped with the usual power options standard and most of the above equipment optional, along with a slightly softer ride and handling.  The top-of-the-line GLE is the luxury model, with many more goodies standard.  If you don't need leather and all the fancy doodads, but want sporty and surefooted handling, the SE is a terrific compromise, though you can sure add most of the GLE's goodies as options to the SE if you so desire.

The more I drive this car, the more I wonder why so many people drive Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys.  The Maxima has a superb record of quality and reliability, as well as fantastic resale value, just like the Accord and Camry.  The Maxima has standard V6 power, unlike the Accord and Camry, which give you standard 4-cylinder power but a price that is almost identical to a Maxima.  Sure, a V6 is available on Accord and Camry, but they are less powerful than the Maxima's and carry a hefty price premium over their 4-cylinder companions.  Though the styling of the current Maxima has sparked debate, it's far better looking than either offering from Honda or Toyota, which many view as very bland.

Nissan has gone to great lengths to make this their best Maxima ever.  I feel that in the near future more and more prospective and current Camry and Accord owners will start asking the same questions I raised, and migrate to their nearest Nissan dealer.
