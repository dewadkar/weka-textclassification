              If you are a settled down small family (with no kids over 10 or no kids that are 6' or over) that doesn't enjoy life in the fast lane, then I would recommend this car. One of the most attractive features of this car is all of the standard features. It comes standard with power everything, ac, stereo, and V6 engine. It's made by Chevrolet so you know that it's a well-built car. I have owned this car for about 3 years and have never had to have it in the shop (except for basic maintenance). Although the car is very well built and reliable, it does have a lot of downfalls. I am 6'4 and need the extra leg room that larger cars offer. Even though the Lumina looks like a very large car that one would think would have plenty of legroom beware, it really doesn't. The 96 Honda Accord as much as people make fun of them about how small they are, actually have lots more legroom front and back. Another problem that I've had with the Lumina is if a taller person is sitting in the back seat and the driver takes a turn where s/he leans against the door, the button that rolls down the window will be pressed by the passenger�s knee. The front seats are really uncomfortable especially the passenger's. The glove box tends to crush the taller passenger�s knees. The performance of the car is good but not excellent, of course if you�re buying this car for a family, then you'd probably not looking for performance. The car is somewhat fast (I've gotten the car from 0-60mph in about 9 seconds) If you�re ever in a really big hurry you can get it up to 120-130. Oh yes, after reading the bad review stating that Luminas get passed by minivans, not true. The only way a minivan will ever pass you in this car is if you let them. I've never gotten this car going as fast as it could go, but at 110 it kept wanting to go even faster. Passing speed is not extremely fast, but it will get you by fast enough. One warning I have for the Lumina owners is to not "hammer" to hard down on the gas while going 20-25mph. If you do, the car will shift into 2nd and give you a unexpected burst of acceleration (I think it's cool though) The V6 engine, while putting out only 160 hp, doesn't give very good gas mileage (20mpg city; 24 mpg hwy). The handling is very loose, but with the anti-lock brake option, you'll stay on course in emergency situations. I didn't like the way the steering has the feeling that it's really a remote control, but you might.
