            I  purchased my Nissan Frontier 2wd Kingcab truck a few months and I am very pleased with my truck.

The truck I bought is a regular run of the mill Kingcab model with the standard 4cyl engine and 5 speed manual tranny. It came with AC (An absolute MUST in Georgia), am/fm/cd player (Great!) and painted wheel well flares.

I paid 11,997 on sale at a Nissan dealership promo here in Georgia. Which is a BIG discount off the sticker price. Of course I had to put up with all of the wailing and knashing of teeth by the dealer when they tried to add on all of those "little" charges...You know.

The truck performs like a DREAM come true!

The Nissan service department is one of the best dealer operated service units that I have EVER encountered. They have me serviced and ready to go in about 1 hr so I wait.

 I was a previous ford F150 owner so I was not used to having a truck that would actually start and run when I needed it!

Since I drive over 200 miles daily, I needed a dependable truck that would give me comfort and good fuel economy. This truck fits the bill.

My only concern with the truck is the DRAMATIC drop in fuel economy if you drive it over 70 mph. The highways here in Georgia have a speed limit of 70mph. The Nissan runs so smoothly that its VERY easy to ease WAY past 70mph. I only notice when I glance over at the fuel gauge and notice that I am burning more after about an hours worth of running.

Anything under 70mph (65-68 mph) and the truck HARDLY burns ANY fuel at all. Its almost as if you have an alternate fuel source. Over 70mph and you'd think that someone shot a hole in your gas tank....oh well I guess I cant have everything.

The Reclining seats in the cab are great. Since my wife is much shorter than I am, she can find an adjustment to suit her needs. The passenger seat is great for catching a snooze when you are not driving too.

The back jump seats are only good for VERY quick trips only. My kids complain that the seats do not have enough cushioning in them. I agree. The time I  rode back there my butt was numb within a few miles plus I almost pulled a muscle getting out from back there!

Overall, for what I need a truck for, this truck is fine. 

I drive a LOT and this little Nissan has taken ALL that I have given it and it asks for more!

The wife and I are considering buying the crew cab version of the Frontier when we replace our other vehicle
