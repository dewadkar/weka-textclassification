            What can i say most suv's these days are looking all the same....except for the ones like the hummer and the defender, but the xterra is different and also at a lower price. Yeah it might not be no hummer but it does handle it self pretty well of the road I drove my friends out in the country for fun in the snow I must say it handled pretty well. On the road I must say I enjoyed driving it too this is not only a great family car for the kids but also a great car for the teens and college students. The car is geared for the x-treme type that watch espn and go rock climbing, but donï¿½t be deceived because it is a great all around car and looks great. I like the colors too it is another cool feature that the car comes with my favorite is the bright yellow that stands out from anywhere so if you are nut like me get the yellow x-terra.<br><br>
