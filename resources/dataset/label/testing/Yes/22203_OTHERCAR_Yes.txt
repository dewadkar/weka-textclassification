            I really wanted a smaller, lighter camera but as my first digital camera and being less than an avid "shutterbug", I couldn't justify the $499 for the ELPH.

I am very pleased with the camera. I took it with me on a trip to Europe, and I was hoping it would not disappoint me. It did not - using the standard resolution (for pictures that are going to be uploaded and not printed) it gave me clear, crisp shots, and not the wavy distortion in color that I've seen with other cameras at the same resolution. Its also very easy to learn to operate. The software it comes with is adequate.

I had already read other Epinions, so I already knew battery life was a problem. Also, since I was taking the camera to Europe, this would have made me spend more money on a voltage converter, so I opted to take lots of batteries instead. Don't buy super cheap batteries - you get what you pay for. When I used 4-AA's that cost around 99 cents, I only got about a half to 3/4 days worth of battery life. I also had some high quality batteries with me, which lasted 2 days before going dead. If you are going to take a lot of pictures, then you probably want to invest in the rechargeable batteries & charger. You'll also want to immediately buy a bigger memory card - the 8MB card it comes with will only give you about 21 pictures on the standard resolution setting. A 64MB card will give you about 105 pictures.

My camera was knocked about 3 feet to the floor the 2nd day I had it - I thought it was gone, but it came back to life and appears to be fine. 

One thing I do find annoying: the dial to switch between settings seems too easy to move around. If you have the camera in your pocket jostling around and you take it out to make a picture, it might be on a setting other than "Capture" because the dial is very easily changed. Save yourself some minor aggravation and check what setting it is on before you turn it on to take pictures.
