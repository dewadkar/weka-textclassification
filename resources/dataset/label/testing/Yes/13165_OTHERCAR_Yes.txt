            I had Toyota '94 Camry before, and still have i and love it - such a good car. But after going to skiing and fishing trips several times, I decided that it's cheaper to get AWD then pay for repairs if I go off the read on it. I also wanted wagon configuration for more space and cargo space on the roof.
I was looking at several potential candidates:
1. still wanted to upgrade '94 Camry to 2002 model
2. Toyota 4Runner
3. Toyota Matrix
4. Toyota Highlander
5. Volkswagen Passat (Wagon)
6. Subaru Forester
7. Subaru Legacy Wagon
8. Subaru Outback Wagon
I was choosing very carefully and test-driving each one of them.
Finally, I made a choice. The best combination of price/quality/features: 2002 Outback Limited Wagon.
This model had standard leather interior, 16" weals, carpeted floor mats, some protective gear (like bumper covers), power driver seat, heated front seats, dual sun roof. I added ski attachments (but since season is over I keep it in garage till next season), 6-disk in-dash CD-changer, sub-woofer/amplifier, security upgrade kit, auto-dimming mirror with compass, hood protector, rear-window dust deflector and air-filtration system. The later two look very sexy on the car, and decrease gas milage about 1-2% - no difference. What makes real difference is ski attachments - after they were removed from the roof, I could drive 5-7 miles more on the galon. Still, gas milage is great with this car.

The car is very bright, lots of space inside, lots of head room, comfy seats, enough leg room for passangers on rear seats.

Very well-behaved on slippery dirt roads, driving over big rocks - suspension and skid control are excellent. Great commuter, too.

Dealer agreed to sell the car for $100 less then invoice price! Get invoice price on carsdirect.com before you visit the dealer.

Also, for $1000 less you can get Outback Legacy Wagon, but with less Outback. Legacy is more of a town car.

Still I wouldn't mind more power. When I need more thrust I switch to 3rd gear (I have automatic trans-n). This is probably the only contra-argument. It doesn't mean the car is completely impotent - 165 hp is alot more then my Camry has (3.0 liter model has ~205 hp), but for the weight of car it seems a _little_ insufficient - I need 10-15% more.
