            First off, I am a college student and was looking for an economical car that was both nice looking and dirt cheap! :)  I was eyeing the 1999 Toyota Corolla, but the model that includes power windows/locks, sunroof, and CD player was way beyond my spending limit.  Therefore, I was quite disappointed and headed to other dealers where I ran into my car: 1999 Mazda Protege LX.  I was quite impressed with the power everything and CD Player.  Not only was the car comfortable to sit in, it had all the little extras everyone always wants but cannot afford.  This car cost me the same as the cheapest model of the Toyota Corolla, but included all the features of the most expensive one.  Another plus to this car is that it is four doors yet it is still compact.  One downfall to this car is the amount of time it takes to pickup speed.  For example, when trying to merge on the expressway unto uncoming traffic, it is hectic to try to speed upto a decent speed where you will not get yourself in an accident.  That really is my only disappointment in the car, everything else is just great.  When I first got the Protege, there were not many in the street.. but now, I have seen MANY of them on the road and it has become very popular.

Here is a list of neat features with the LX (that I personally love):
*Sunroof
*Enough space for 5 people
*4 door
*Power Windows
*Power Locks
*Remote Keyless Entry (This is optional - I got it and love it!)
*Two Cupholders
*Dual Airbags
*Cruise Control
*AM/FM Radio with CD Player
*Antenna is right above the driver's door where you can reach out your hand and pull it up.  (Wish it was powered!)
*A/C

It has so many other features that you should take a look at if you go to http://www.mazda.com.

I really recommend this car to those who want to be cost effective!
