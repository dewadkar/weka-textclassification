             My parents always told me that when I turned 16 if I wanted a car I had to get a job and pay for it myself, so I did just that. I got an after school job at a local grocery store to save up money for the shiny red Toyota Celica GT with my name all over it at the local used car dealership. Here I am nearly 4 years later still enjoying the same car I worked so hard to buy my junior year of high school. The car is a 1990, and still runs like new. The only thing I ever had to replace on it was  the breaks and the "boot" on the front passangers side axil. 
 I absolutly love my car. It is very compact and small but it has a lot of trunk room, which is good for me as a college student to lug laundry baskets back and forth. My car is pretty basic, no power windows or power locks, but it does have air conditioning which is great during the humid summer months. I do have to admit that I think this is more of a girls car, then a guys car. My boyfriend absolutly hates riding in it. He is 6'2 and  its kind of cramped for him to sit in the passangers seat. 
 I have never had a problem with any parts or any aspect of the car for that matter. My biggest disappointment with the car was that the paint began fading about a year after I bought it. It was not a pretty sight, but I can not blame this on Toyota, because I'm not sure if it was repainted by the previous owner or not. I fixed this easily though by getting it painted a deep purple, and taking good care of it sinse then. 
 If you are the type of person who is looking for a car with a good system in it, then the Celica is a pretty good option for you. I mean, I don't go driving down the road with the base pumping or anything, but  the radio comes in clear and it has good sound when you decide to crank up the volume a bit when your favorite song comes on. 
 The Celica also has very good(rear)crash impact, and this I know from experience. I was rear ended last summer by an older woman who was watching the other cars around us....dont ask me why.... and what I felt was minor compared to the dent on my back bumper. 
 All in all I highly recomend this car to anyone, young or old. As long as you aren't to tall, and you like to have fun driving, this is the car for you. It is easy to handle, and easy to parallel park since its so small. It is definitly a GREAT car!
