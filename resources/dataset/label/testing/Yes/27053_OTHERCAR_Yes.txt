            No doubt!  This camera is PRETTY!  In the case, this little beauty will probably catch your eye. Gold highlights on a silvery, slim, very modern shell, just set it apart from even more expensive models. And, in the under $500 category, this little honey backs down from no one! The zoom is optical! Good resolution is a built in. Olympus has been in the camera business since 1930, and it shows in this sparkler. Even the LCD display is crystal clear. A few moments, (yes, you should read the directions!) and you are out with the kids and Grandma will be so impressed! So will the kids, since you can download to the TV, or the VCR, (the kids just LOVE  that!), or like most of us, to your computer. Then just pick the ones you like and go for it! Lexar offers up to a 64mb smart media card to augment the 8mb card that comes with it. Talk about a mess of pictures!And with 3 resolution levels, you can fit the image to your needs. If you're going to go for the high quality portrait stuff, get at least a 32mb card. It takes almost 5mb for the super-high-quality pictures. Plan accordingly. (Check out that&quot;Burst&quot; mode!) Keep lots of freshly charged batteries handy, and just have a ball!! And, ladies, yes, the camera is beautiful! Tres chic!<br><br>
