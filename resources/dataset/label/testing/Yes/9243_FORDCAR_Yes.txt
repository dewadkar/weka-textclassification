            My wife and I recently returned from a week long vacation in New York and Vermont. To get us around on the trip, we rented a Ford Contour. I hadn't driven or ridden in a Contour before but I was aware of the fact that it was larger than an Escort and smaller than a Taurus. With just myself, my wife, and my daughter, I didn't figure we would need anything larger and it turned out that the Contour provided us with more space than we needed.

**THE EXTERIOR**

The contour is a nice looking little car and looks similar to the Toyota Camry's or the Nissan Altima's. It is a little plain when it comes to style, but hey...this is not sports car. For a family sedan, it looks pretty nice. The aerodynamic design provided for decent handling even on windy days.

***THE INTERIOR**

Like the exterior, the interior is a little plain. While there are decent cupholders and quite a few little cubby-holes to stow stuff, it appears that Ford designed this car with simplicity in mind. The seats were comfortable and adjusted rather easily to fit my long legs. Pushing the drivers-side seat all the way back, however, did not leave much room for a rear-passenger's legs. 

I also found the center armrest to be irritating. It was just short enough that I couldn't rest my elbow on it while driving. This means I had to hold my arm up or drive with my left hand...something I'm not used to. It was surprising how much I missed the armrests in my cars at home.
As for the controls, they are very accessible and easy to operate. Those controls that are not located on the dash are found on the steering column.

While I did not try it, it also appears that the back seat folds down much like those in the Ford Escorts and Mercury Tracers. This is a very handy feature for those that need to haul long objects on occasion. Folding down the seat allows you to push your cargo through the trunk into the rear of the passenger compartment with ease. The trunk was large enough to fit our two large suitcases and three small ones with no problems, so I considered that a bonus.

**THE HANDLING**

I was kind of surprised by the handling of the Contour. I have a Mercury Tracer and have had a Ford Thunderbird in the past and neither have handled very well. The Contour, on the other hand, provided a nice feel for the road and responded quickly to my steering commands. The peppy little engine provided enough power to get us through the Adirondack mountains with no problem and even features an Overdrive On/Off switch which allows you to gain a few more horses if you need them.

**The CAR**

With the exception of the center armrest, I had no problems with the Contour. It got around 25 mpg on our trip which I felt was pretty average for a smaller sedan through the mountains. While I find the looks of the Contour to be a little too boring to purchase one, I think it server really well as a rental car.<br><br>
