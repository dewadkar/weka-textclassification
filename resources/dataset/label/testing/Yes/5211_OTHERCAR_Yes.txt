            The DX-10 I'm using was given as a birthday (4/99) gift to my dad. He used it about once a week to take pictures of a variety of subjects. I asked to borrow it about 2 months (2/00) to take some photos for my brother-in-laws web page. Since that time I've used the camera about twice a week to take photos of my daughter. My wife's family lives in Taiwan, and posting the pictures to my website is the best way for them to see her. They've been cropped and reduced 50% to save file space.

Now that you know what I use the camera for on to the review:

All the controls for the camera are positioned in the right spots. The shutter button is in a comfortable position for the way I hold the camera. The dial on the back to select the mode is under the thumb so it's east to operate. The button to toggle the display off/on is in a location so it's hard to accidently turn it on. The weight of the camera is not too heavy or light. For me it feels right.

The camera is great for daytime pictures, and flash pictures at night. It helps if your subjects are within the flash range otherwise you get a black image. I know there are manual settings for taking night pictures but I'm still learning the camera.

The LCD display is nice for previewing your picture and reviewing a shot, but it does suck up battery power. I use it with rechargeable batteries so it doesn't go through batteries as fast.

I take pictures in the 1024X768 mode, so I get only 13 pictures on the 2MB memory card that came standard with the camera. At some point I'll get a bigger memory card and try different image sizes, but for now it takes great pictures for what I want to do.

Good Accessories:
Rechargeable Batteries
Flash Path Adapter for transferring pictures to the computer
Larger Memory Card
