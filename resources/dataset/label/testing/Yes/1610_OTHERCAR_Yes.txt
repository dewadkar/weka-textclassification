            This is a neat little car, but honestly, I think the price is way to high for what you are getting.

The seats are very low quality.  There is very little room, in the front and in the back.  The road noise is VERY loud.  And it does not come standard with power windows and doorlocks (at least no the model we got anyway).  I just feel that for the amount of money we are paying for this car, we got very little car indead.  It is a small step up from a Suzuiki Swift in my opinion.  It would make a good first car, and is very reliable.  But thats about all thats good that I can say about it.  Other then that, its not the best thing out there for the money.<br><br>
