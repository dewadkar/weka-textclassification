            My family has just bought a chevy impala. I think it is a smooth handling car. It is also very quiet. I bought this vehicle because I thought it would be fun to drive. And boy was I rite. Not only is it smooth and quiet but it also has a fast excelaration rate. And is also very roomy. I payed about twenty grand for this car. But it is far worth paying some extra money for this car. The color I chose is the same as in the picture. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a nice car with more interior space then any other car practically on the market.<br><br>
