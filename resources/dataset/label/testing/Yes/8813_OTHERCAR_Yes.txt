            We have had 4 Honda's in the past 18 years.  One Civic and 3 Accords.  All of them, (except the 2000) reached over 200,000 miles.  We expect to get the same with the 2000.  The car is reliable.  Though the dealers require more maintainance checks than necessary, the car will last you for years.  The 2000 has a great sunroof and roomy trunk.  The back seat is comfortable and has enough leg room in it for adults.  The interior fabric is plush and cleans up well.  The carpet cleans up well, too.  The CD player works well and the kids love it!  The gas mileage is about 25-30 on the highway.  Not bad with today's gas prices.  

The downfalls to the 2000 is the seatbelts in the front seat are hard to fasten and takes time to get used to it.  If the 2000 is like the other Hondas that we had - it will rust sooner than some cars.  We just got rid of our 87 Honda accord with over 200,000 miles and besides the rust (the trunk rusted out), the car was in great shape.  This car is a great family car - especially for people that buy cars and keep them forever.  Our son who is 12 will probably learn to drive in this car when he is 16, since we bought a Honda with a 5 speed and I want him to learn to drive both standard and automatics.
