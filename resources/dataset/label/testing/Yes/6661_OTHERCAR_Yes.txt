              My wife loves this little truck( it has a full frame unlike Rav4,Crv ) and can maneuver it into any tough parking situation out there. I feel comfortable knowing that the visibility is great, ground clearance is amazing( higher than an Expedition....trust me on this one !)and that she'll never get stuck in a blizzard.
  I have the 4x4 convertible top with auto,CD,steel wheels(replaced with alloys). The interior is comfortable, the heater burns your face off,AC is fairly cold,and the speaker system is amazing for this cute ute. The only caution that I have is be VERY careful washing those plastic windows on the top, they scratch if you breathe on them!
  Two annoying things I experienced: chirping bird noise under the hood turned out to be a belt tensioner(had to be ordered overseas from dealer) and a sticky sleeve on a caliper that squeaks every once in awhile. These problems don't affect the driving, so we are still happy with this purchase.
  For those who want to know about long trips, after a 13 hour drive to Cape Cod this past summer, we give it a THUMBS UP!<br><br>
