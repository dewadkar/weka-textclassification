            The 2000 Celica looks like something out of a cartoon.  Triangular headlights on the hood, minuscule fog lights and a hood scoop (functional?  I am not sure) that definitely makes this car seem aggressive.  Its futuristic looking, and definitely more sportier then the earlier models.  The 2000 model is a small  2 seater much like the Mercury Cougar and the Acura Integra that it is supposed to be competing against.  Its a nice, sexy looking machine, and much appreciated by drivers who simply like to look good on the road.

Want added futuristic feel to the looks?  How about steering-wheel mounted, button gear shifters that you only thought you could get on a Ferrari.  I would love to have given this a try-out, but the Celica that I had the pluck to drive was an automatic GT.  Celica is usually advertised as a sports car.  One of Toyota's ad campaigns reads, 'Affordable...because we decided not to include a pit crew.&quot;  This is a highly misleading banner that makes me want to say thank you epinions.  Celica is not a performance car. You will not get impressive quater mile results, and the car itself told me outright that it was not a sports car when I floored the pedal.  It seemed to have decent pick-up until it hit 60's, but then the acceleration turned into what I would call a creep.  The speedometer kept rising, but with such slowliness that it made me want to sleep.

If it was in the sports car category, the GT would be a downright embarrasment.  The 4 cylinder engine can only push 140HP horsepower.  The GTS is not that much better either -- 180HP.  The 84 Dodge that I could afford back in my highschool days could go as fast as this car.  You want to insist on saying that Celica is a sports car?  Well, as a sports car I give this thing zero stars.  You may look good and sporty on the road, but when a Firebird or a Mustang comes sniffing the road behind you, I would say move out of the way.  Although at the same price level, both american cars outperform the Celica engine by having around 100 more horses.

Now, I don't want to talk about what Celica isn't, but rather what it is.  Its a small, agile commuter -- an economy car with sexy styling.  Driving it is a lot of fun, the steering response is pretty good and I was seriously impressed by the suspension system.  The only other Celica I had ever driven had been a 93 year model, and if memory serves right the only feel of the road I had gotten was the bumps and the holes.  If you are a moderate driver, who enjoys driving small cars and who is not an aggressive speeder, then Celica might be the perfect car for you.  It will give you great gas mielage with decent pickup below highspeeds.  The sleek, futuristic shape of the car is a definite head turner.  Also, if you are going to get a Celica, get the new GTS model with the button shifters and give me a call:&gt;<br><br>
