            I tried really hard to turn in my 1994 Camry XLE for
a 2000 model.  The newer car really is pretty good.
But I just couldn't. My older one is showing its
age at 100,000 miles but is still runs just fine
and has a lot going for it. Here are some of the reasons
(which may all sound small, but they matter a lot
to me):
- Less comfortable seats, sitting you down too low
  and with not enough support - this is my number one
  problem with the car
- LCD for the odometer - I cannot read it, especially
  in the sunlight - and it no longer has tenths of a mile
- Continuing to use LCDs for many of the audio systems
- Tiny drink holder
- No more easy push button system for heating and cooling
- Fit and finish (the trunk always looks like it
  doesn't quite fit right)
- The &quot;wood&quot; trim option looks chintzy and does not
  show the wood grain well
- Weak selection of exterior colors (all the best ones
  seem to be reserved for the Lexus)
- Looks - Toyota - get some style!
- (I would never get leather because it is hot in the
  summer and clammy when cold), but the leather used on the
  leather seat option is not the best quality or workmanship)
Note that I have driven these cars as rentals on many
occasions while on business and I really do think it is a
great car for someone who is not lucky enough to have
a 1994 as I do.  But I've been spoiled by the older ones
that were better.<br><br>
