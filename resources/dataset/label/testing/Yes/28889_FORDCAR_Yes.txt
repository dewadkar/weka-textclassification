            The Ford Explorer was one of the best investments i have ever made. That stuff that people say about a car flipping over isn't true with this SUV. You feel safe when you're behind the wheel. The car rides smooth and is great for long trips with lots of cargo space. I've owned this vehicle for 2 months and have had slight problems. This car really hasn't had any problems, and it's reliable. But the minor problems were both fixed by the Ford Company because of the 36,000 mile warranty. The company is fair and honest, and they really know how to treat a customer. Also, my car has been hit four times when it was parked somewhere. It has survived all four instances without even receiving a scratch. I may just be lucky, but i would say that the car is built to protect the driver. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves to drive because it is great for road trips or just cruisin' around town. It is definitely an awesome buy!!
