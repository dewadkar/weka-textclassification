            We bought our 1999 Ford Windstar in August of '99 and wouldn't give it up for the world.  I love the way it handles, the leg space is so much better than any of the other mini-vans we tried, and most important to me is that the seats are larger and there is more space behind the steering wheel for larger people.  My first thought when purchasing this van was safety and comfort and the Windstar definitely has both.  We also got the model with the automatic sliding door and it is so wonderful to be able to just push a button and open the door when your hands and arms are full of groceries or children.

We highly recommend the Windstar to anyone who has children or grandchildren or even just if you travel a lot and need extra space for luggage or wheelchairs (I have one of those too).  We have found nothing about the Windstar that we do not like.<br><br>
