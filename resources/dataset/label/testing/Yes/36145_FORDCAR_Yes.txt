I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical about this car at first.  I owned a '93 Escort LX and really didn't want to own another one or another car like it (Ford is replacing the Escort with the Focus).  Don't get me wrong, the Escort was great and dependable for getting me back and forth while in college, but I wanted something that didn't have &quot;Grandma&quot; written all over it.  After being convinced by several different people to give the Focus a test drive I did.  And I completely enjoyed every second of it.  So much so that I am now the proud owner of an autumn orange ZX3 two-door hatchback.  

The Focus has it all:  Euro styling and handling at an American car price.  Complete strangers have waited by my ZX3 just to ask me about it.  And I have to tell them just how much I love driving it whether it be on the highway or local roads.  There is plenty of head room; even my friends who are over six feet find it comfortable.  Although there isn't a lot of leg room in the back seat, the seats are so comfortable that passengers forget about the lack of leg space (this is what passengers in my car have told me).  The stereo system rocks and having a CD player standard made it all the better.  The amply powered engine could use a few more ponies, though.  I've heard a rumor that Ford is planning to offer higher performance models.  There are a few blind spots, but they aren't anything that would completely deter one's driving fun!!<br><br>
