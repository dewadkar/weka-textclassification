            I bought it because I've used the DC3400 and was very pleased with it. I did some research before buying this model, and finally decided to give it a try.

I didn't get the docking station with it, I just got the camera and additional memory.

<b>What I like about it:</b>

<i>Great pictures</i>.- It provides two resolutions: 960x600 and 1800x1200

<i>Video/Audio capture</i>.- Two video qualities available, creates Quicktime files (.mov)

<i>Easy to use</i>.- Its menu system its pretty easy and straightforward to use. You don't have too much options, so it's kind of easy to learn to use.

<i>Optical viewfinder</i>.- LCD use is optional, so you can save battery life. It has an option to have an LCD quickview of the snapshot, but you can disable it.

<i>Embedded lens cover</i>.- The lens cover is embedded in the camera body, you slide a button to cover/uncover it. No hanging rubber lens covers.

<i>Very lightweight</i>.- This makes it easy to carry with you everywhere, even with AA batteries.


<b>What I dislike about it:</b>

<i>USB Only</i>.- Make sure you have available USB ports on your PC. If you need to download pictures on a PC without free USB ports, you're fried!.

<i>No DC Input</i>.- No docking station? so, how do you recharge the included battery pack?? there is no way to do it! So you better get the docking station or buy rechargeable AA Ni-MH batteries.

<i>Storage Handling</i>.- The camera haves 8Mb internal memory, and a Compact Flash port. If you have a CF card installed you have to use the menu to <b>manually</b> change your storage location and choose between either the Internal memory or the Picture card.

<i>No effects</i>.- Forget about B/W, sepia or any other effect (like borders) in your pictures. Just plain color pictures.


<b>Somehow bothers me:</b>

<i>File Naming Conventions</i>.- Unlike the picture card, if you reformat the internal memory the picture sequence number restarts at 1. On the picture card the camera keeps the sequence number, no matter if you change or reformat the card. Is this a good or a bad thing?.
