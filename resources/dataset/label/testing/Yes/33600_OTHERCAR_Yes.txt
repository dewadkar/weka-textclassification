            I have had my C230K Sport for about 1 year now. It is a great car! The new C230 engine taken from the SLK roadster makes all the difference in the world. The older C-Class were on the slow side and lacked energy. The new C230 has a great get up and go feeling to it. Hit the gas and you're off! The performance tires added by the sport package provide the car with excellent handling. The Car hugs turns like you wouldn't believe. When it comes to braking, the C230 stops on a dime, while staying on a perfectly straight line. The C230 actually goes 70-0 faster than many sports cars out there. The C230 interior is typical mercedes, everything is pretty simple and easy. The seats are firm and supportive, heated seats is an option also. The C230 is a great choice for anyone who wants mercedes luxury and performance at a pretty good price.<br><br>
