            The XJ220 is the fastest production car in the world with a V6 engine. It was once the fastest production car ever, but that ended when the McLaren F1 came out. The XJ220 was originally going to be produced with a V12, but production took too long and was too expensive with this engine, so they used a Turbo V6 instead with 542hp. Although the Jaguar XJ220 is constructed of aluminum, it is no puny car. The immensely strong panels and chassis on the XJ220 give it massive structural integrity - after its government crash test, the glazing on the car remained intact and all doors and rear panels opened normally! Also, the XJ220's wheels carry ultra low profile tires, which cost more than $1,100 each! The XJ220 is a great car, but performance and style come at a price. The average cost of an XJ220 today is $706,000!<br><br>
