<TEXT>
            I looked at 4 cars.  The Lexus IS 300, the new BMW 330Ci, the Audi S4 and the CL Type S.  Here are the results:

IS 300 (Called Toyota Altezza and Lexus IS 200 in Europe and Japan)

Pros:

Rear Wheel Drive.  If you want to talk about true driving pleasure, RWD is still the way to go.  But after I drove the CL, I have to say that FWD has come a LONG way.  It seems that RWD keeps that advantage mostly in theory.  There is a difference but it is a little more than marginal.

Engine sound.  The 3.0 liter, 215HP engine is the second best sounding engine after the CL's.

Engine�s linear output.  Just like BMW�s engine, there are no power-steps, no gaps.  Straight line, flat torque curve is confirmed from butt-meter here. Not as smooth as the 330Ci's though.

We (US consumers) are lucky to get this engine straight from the GS 300 (only detuned by 10hp) because Europe is getting 2 engines which are both 2 liter engines.  One is a straight 4 but the other is an I6.  The 4 makes 155hp the I6 makes 200hp! at 7600rpm I believe but as you can see it is a screamer.  Not recommended for US drivers who prefer low and mid-range torque (it is not the drivers, it is the terrain).

Price: cheaper than the BMW and the Audi and a good value overall.

Looks.  It looks unique but too retro and not as conservative as the luxury category would suggest (talk about conservative looks, the CL is the king here).

Fun to drive.  With traction control off it easily slides.

Confidence inspiring brakes mainly due to feel not according to how they really perform in practice according to tests performed by various magazines.

Feels light on its feet.

Cons:

4 Doors.  What is Lexus thinking?  If they are truly competing with the 3 series from BMW, they need to produce a coupe IS.  Let us hope.

Auto tranny (manual coming next year).  For true sports driving excitement, you have to be able to shift, although I have to say that the sequential sport shift technology has come a LONG way.  The problem with the IS is that the buttons for changing gears are on the steering wheel.  One cannot shift while turning, you cannot find the buttons.  The CL does not have that problem because you shift by shifting the shifter.

Interior:  Worst interior of all 4 cars BY FAR.  There was not even a handrest which is something that 15K cars offer these days.  I was very negatively surprised by that.

Cramped in the rear.

Understeering a LOT: You'd expect this car to have the tendency to oversteer first.  Theory says so for RWD cars.  Wrong!  Mine understeered like, in theory, the Acura SHOULD (but not the case...more on this later).

I do not believe that the IS comes with any sort of stability assist tool.  There is traction control but no DSC or VSA here.

Audi S4 manual tranny:

Pros:

Main pro of this car is its unbelievable stability.  Yes, it is probably due to the AWD (Quattro) but as an ex-AWD sport coupe owner (96 Eagle Talon TSi AWD), I have to say that implementation is still the key.  One cannot just assume that all AWD applications are the same and make the car behave the same.  Bottom line, this car is the hardest to take off the road.  You have got to try hard to find yourself in the ditch with this car.  Unfortunately, this same AWD advantage is also a disadvantage for the car (more on this later).

Best interior together with that of the BMW's.

It is one thing to make a lot of power by force-feeding a given engine but it is another to make it with a FLAT torque curve as the one in the S4.  How VW engineers managed this in this case is worth noting.  On paper and butt-meter confirmed that this engine makes equal amounts of  torque from 2500rpm to 5500rpm.

Most torquey engine both on feel and according to the numbers.  This car felt the fastest of all mainly because its engine makes the most torque (but not the most power).  The numbers are 250HP and 258lb-ft of torque. As far as torque the BMW makes 214 lb-ft, the IS makes 218 lb-ft and the CL makes 232 lb-ft. So when you press the gas pedal to go from 30 mph to 50 mph in the Audi, you feel as if this is the quicker car of the lot and that is where torque shows.  Of course peak torque numbers mean nothing if you do not see the actual curve which is pretty flat throughout the rpm range for all cars here.  All engineer teams here understand the &quot;flat torque&quot; concept and its importance in this category, especially in this country.

Lag is still a tad noticeable but Audi has done a great job here, all but eliminating it.  Actually, the main factor that betrays the turbos� existence is the fact that once you reach the 2600rpm mark the torque basically �doubles� (or at least it feels that way from my butt-meter).  That is when the turbos spool and intake charge dramatically increases.

Brakes.  Second best brakes after BMW.

Offers manual tranny and auto as an option.

Easiest car to modify and make up to 400+ reliable HP.  Anyone who knows how easy turbocharging is to tweak, and how CHEAP above all, will understand exactly what I mean.  THe 1,8 liter Turbo engine that goes in the base A4 making 150hp and now 170hp (and 225hp in the TT) can be tweaked to make up to 320 reliable HP no problem.  Of course kiss that FLAT torque curve goodbye.

Cons:

4 Doors.  Audi has got to come up with a 2 door A4 car.  And from what I hear it is rumored that the next A4 coming out in about a year will have a coupe version.

The styling needs to be refreshed at this point.  I know that Audi will not be doing this since they are close to the new car�s introduction.  Also, the S4 needs to look more different than the 1.8T and the 2.8 A4s.  You cannot tell this is a special A4, it looks just like another A4.  By the way, notice that the S4 lacks any Audi badging (excluding the logo).  Sorry, although worthnoting, this is not going to be enough differentiation from the other A4s.

AWD.  Yes.  The car�s incredible stability is a disadvantage here.  You just cannot have some fun with this super-stable car.  No oversteer on demand, no fun, sorry.  You can turn that BMW with the gas.

Price.  The 2001 S4 actually added another $1500 or so for no apparent added value.  So one could say that you pay 1.5K and that is what is new for 2001.  Bad!  The car I drove had a $41,700 MSRP and there were things that the CL had that the S4 did not.

Give me back my 15HP?  The S4 in Europe makes 265HP from the same engine.  Why is it always the case us getting less power (IS 300 not the case)?  According to Audi the main reason for that is the lower octane gas sold in the US.  You can find 98 octane gas in Europe as opposed to up to 93 here.  So, unless if you want your S4 start detonating, the 250hp will do (I believe torque is not affected by this though and that is what the strength of this engine is).

BMW 330Ci manual tranny

Pros:

KING of handling.  But not by so much as before the CL Type S came aboard.  King of fun driving hands down though.  How BMW engineers keep finding that golden combination of world class road holding and handling without punishing its occupants, is a mystery (the Type S is not that far back though).  The car I drove had the sports package added.

Best brakes.  I broke from 55mph down to zero as hard as I could and I felt the acceleration of gravity pull my face�s skin towards the windshield like never before.  I have to admit though I have not performed this test with the CL and judging from the fact that the CL out-broke the 328Ci Automatic (with no sport package though), I have to say that I expect similar results with the CL.  I own the CL now and I have not done it because new brakes need to be broken in for at least 500 miles :-)  Needless to say that the BMW stopped dead straight (with no help from my hands holding the steering wheel).

Engine.  Smoothest of all and linear as the IS 300�s.  As far as power I have to say that the BMW did not feel as fast as the numbers claimed by BMW.  They claim 0-60 in 6,4 seconds with the manual.  I don�t know.  The fact that the CL�s engine feels more powerful after 5000rpm (when the aggressive cams are kicked in by the VTEC), makes the car feel faster (and that is what it is all about in the end, how it feels not how it really does on paper).

Most balanced car of the lot on paper and in reality.  The main reason BMW decided to continue the RWD configuration back in early 90s designing the E40 (the previous 3 series body), was front-rear weight balance.  Excluding the auto tranny cars, there is no 3 series BMW (sedans and coupes only plus the Z3 roadsters) that deviates more than 1% in front-rear weight balance!  Amazing.  And it does show in practice, trust me.  I have driven the M Roadster about 6 months ago as well as the 2000 323i for which 323i I decided not to write about in this review.

Offers manual tranny and auto as an option.

Best looking exterior of all cars and best looking interior together with the S4.

There is something about not being able to put a finger between the rear tire and the fender.  Can�t Acura engineers lower the CL so that it looks this way?  It looks much more sporty.  On paper the CL's suspension setup is the most high-tech of all (together with that of the IS 300).

Cons:

PRICE!  I do not believe that this car is worth this kind of money.  Sorry.  And I am saying this when the car I want is the BMW.  There is just so much money to give for so much benefit and in this case the math does not work.

BMW boosted the steering pump in this new 330Ci intentionally and destroyed the best steering in the market in my opinion.  That same day I drove a used 1998 M3 and that helped remind me of what BMW engineers CAN do with steering feel.  So the previous statement should be underlined.  The CL now has better steering than the BMW 330Ci.  The case is not so in the older 328s.  BMW, unboost please.  Whose side are you on, this was one of the reasons these cars were great, fun to drive cars.  Or at least unboost in the coupes' case only and leave the sedan and cabrio boosted.

Still cramped in the back.  CL is the king here.

CD changer goes ONLY in the trunk.  So the CL is 2 steps ahead of these guys.  Not only it is in the cabin but also it is IN-DASH.

Sports package comes with summer tires which means that I have to invest in winter tires for the Chicago area here when snow time starts.  The CL comes with high quality All Season tires which is not a complete solution but you MIGHT be able to get away with them in the snow at least during the first winter.

Engine needs more torque believe it or not.  They did a fair job in raising the power from 193hp to 225hp but torque increase is marginal.  From 206 lb-ft to 214 lb-ft.  You cannot even feel that.  Disappointed here I was by this car.

2001 3.2 CL Type S

Let us start with the CONS here:

Theoretically, FWD configuration has a number of disadvantages in this sporty category, the main ones are:  You cannot have fun while driving in the twisties.  The only thing that applies here is that you cannot oversteer the car and turn it with the gas and the steering because the front wheels are both moving the car, and are responsible for steering the car at the same time.  In a RWD setup you have the front wheels doing the steering only, the rear wheels doing the pushing and all 4 wheels doing the roadholding.  Also, FWD does not help with balance.  The numbers say that this car�s weight bias is 63% front, 37% rear.  And it shows under hard acceleration while turning.  260HP and 232lb-ft of torque is just too much for the front wheels especially wearing mid-sized (215mm) ALL-SEASON tires.  Sorry it is the truth.  Overall though, this car holds probably as well as the 330Ci with the Sport Package when turning, fun factor aside.  And according to MotorTrend mag it outperformed the 328Ci in lateral acceleration as well as the slalom.  The 328 though was not equipped with the Sport Package and I have to say that because it was a close call, the CL will probably lose to the 330Ci I drove.  But not by much.

No manual tranny offered.  This is something that Acura can probably solve fast but I doubt they will soon.  They already have stated that the cost to develop one overcomes the % of people asking for one.  I don�t doubt that but still.  Maybe it will be offered in the CL Type R !  Just kidding...or am I?  Imagine a Type R CL with 290HP from the same engine, aggressive sports tires this time, a little stiffer suspension, and 300 pounds lighter.  0-60 in 5,2 secs and 1/4 mile in 13,9 secs and only for $8,000 more.  Kiss that E46 M3, I really want, goodbye.

This car is the heaviest of the lot.  I mean the S4 is heavy (actually in the case of the automatic S4 it is 50 pounds heavier than the CL), but at least it�s got the AWD which adds at least 200 pounds to it to justify its case.  At 3600 pounds the CL is getting to be obese and mass is mass when it comes to sporty driving.  Yes they tried to compensate with the most powerful engine in the class  and stiffer suspension but inertia is inertia when it comes to start taking turns.  Still, the CL is light on its feet in reality.  If this car was 300 pounds lighter this car would have been in the high 5s for the 60mph and it would have been closer in handling with the BMW.  I wonder how it'd feel...

Looks.  Sorry Acura, I understand everything there is to know about economies of scale but you have to differentiate this car from the Accord coupe a LOT more.  This car looks too much like a mid class sedan like a Camry, etc.  The best looking part of the car in my opinion is the rear but the sides and the front look like�well you know.  Let us not forget though that the CL is the 9th car based on what Honda calls the &quot;Mid-size global platform&quot;.  This is how they managed to pack all this value for $30K.  Take it or leave it and go deeper in your pocket for the 330Ci which is the best looking car in the lot in my opinion.

PROS:

PRICE, VALUE, BANG FOR THE BUCK!  This car may as well be the best value of all cars, all categories in the US today.  How Acura managed to pack all this value for 30K is amazing.  No contest here.  The other 2 best values that come to mind in general is the Z06 Vette and all other C5 Vettes for that matter and another one from Acura again, the cousin 3,2 TL which for 28,8K is the best sedan value in the market today in my opinion.

Best all-around engine.  In particular, most powerful, second most torquey, second smoothest and best sounding engine in the class.  When that 5K rpm hits under heavy load, this thing sounds like a V8.  I still find myself lowering the Bose�s volume to listen to it.  There are three 6 cylinder engines that I know of that make more power right now.  Two of these engines are worn by exotic supercars.  One is the 2.8 liter, inline six &quot;put in&quot; the Volvo S80 however, aggressively turbocharged by two blowers and ends up with (only) 8 more HP.  The other is the normally aspirated (also 3,2 liter) engine worn by the Acura NSX which makes more power only when mated to the manual tranny (290 HP manual, 252 HP auto).  It is worth noting that the 290HP engine in the NSX makes LESS torque than the engine in the Type S (NSX=224 lb-ft @5500, Type S=232 lb-ft @3500-5500).  Finally the 3.4 and 3.6 liter flat 6 in the Porsche 911 and 911 Turbo cars making 300 and 415 HP and 258 and 415 lb-ft of torque.  So bottom line, no one can make that much power (as in the Type S) without turbocharging or charging a TON of cash.

Compared to auto tranny cars, this is the fastest car of all.  At 13,7 pounds per HP even math proves it.

6 In-Dash CD is unsurpassed, all cars will be configured like this in the future.  And the Bose sounds great but it needs a sub-woofer to be perfect.

Standard VSA (Vehicle Stability Assist which includes Traction Control).  Combined with the all season tires = great combination.  See, Acura engineers found the best blend of performance and comfort both with their suspension as well as the wheel and tire package.  Specifically:

Double wishbone suspension (all 4 corners) is the most aggressive setup and it is 100% sporty in theory.  There is nothing about comfort with this setup whatsoever.  But Acura refined it to the point where it feels great.  So they get the benefits of this aggressive setup as far as sroptiness is concerned but they tamed it to be comfortable.  Straight line drivability, by the way, at high speeds is top notch.  Now, going further down to the tires and wheels.  It is all about compromising, giving a little here and there to get the most balanced effect.  Wheels are 17 inch which gives you great steering response but at the same time tires are not very aggressive as far as compound.  They are not S02s or G-Force TAs or MXX3s or P-Zeros.  They are All Season Super Touring tires, but then again they are of low profile which is again helping with the response, but then again they are not very wide (215 - unlike the 245 the 330Ci gets in the rear), which low width helps with lowering the total mass of unsprung components and with NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness).  Amazing negotiating with the laws of physics Acura engineers did here.  The result is a more comfortable ride than the BMW but when it start getting twisty, the Acura is more than capable.

Best seats.  Although it needs a telescoping steering wheel option to make it 100% the best seating position of all.  The BMW seat, seats lower and it gives you a sportier feeling but the CL�s seat padding is for sure the best.

Best ergonomics.

Largest trunk in the class.

Probably best rear passenger room in the class.  And if not best, close to that.  Up to 5 feet 8 inches you are 100% fine in the rear.  At 6 feet you are OK for up to 45 minute trips.

Best GPS for those that bought it.  I did not.  I do not need it especially for 2K.  I usually know where I am going albeit being &quot;orientation handicapped&quot;.  Stop at the gas station and ask for directions and keep that $2K for the new Comptech headers, exhaust and cold air intake...just kidding.

Solid, rigid body like the BMW and the S4.

17 inch wheels and low profile tires (215X50X17) come standard with the Type S.  Also 7 inch wide wheels.

Packed with options (heated front seats and outside mirrors for example).  And all come standard which makes this an easy car to negotiate.  BMW has a ton of different configurations which makes it hard to get the car you really want.

Best A/C in the class with the shortest cooling time of all according to Acura engineers.

Those Xenon lights really WORK.  I was very surprised at this technology, I thought it was a gimmick initally.

Bottom line I just could not resist this deal.  The car I wanted was the 330Ci but I could not justify the $10K-$11K more.

------5 WEEKS LATER--------

I am still convinced I made the right decision.  In all fairness, the car I really want is the new M3 coming out late this year with a waiting list of almost a year (I would not pay over MSRP if I tried).  Here are some comments now that I know the car.

The Bose stereo needs a base boost.  Maybe a bazooka will fix it but I wonder if I want some BestBuy teen to touch my car...hmmm..  High and mid frequencies come out very nicely but the bass is not enough.  Actually this creates another problem.  To hear the bass I Keep raising the volume and sometimes, with the roof open and the windows down, I find myself trying to raise the volume only to see that I am at 100%.  I wonder if a bazooka will fix this...

Also, there are rattles coming out of the rear speakers ONLY at specific bass frequencies and only when the bass knob is turned on 100%.

There is a problem with the driver's window full-down auto mechanism (or so I think).  There are 2 ways to push the button that will make the window go down.  One is NOT all the way, to make the window continue going down as long as you hold the button down.  And the other way is to push the button all the way once which will make the window go down completely.  Well the latter does not work right now.  I still have not decided to take the car to the dealer.  Will comment about the experience when I do take it in.

The moonroof opens only half way!?!  There is still a ton of room for it to expose but I guess there is no more room for it to fit inside the skin of the top of the car.  Very annoying and very disappointed...I remember the BMW moonroof, the opening was huge.

That tach should have been bigger.  Maybe when the Type R comes out...

If you take a turn really hard, you can feel that the shocks are at their margin.  The car plows for a sec and that is enough to spoil the experience.  Yes the car is tight but at the margin it is no M3 nor S4.  Acura knows that, they admitt that the above mentioned cars are not the direct competition.  They see the CLK 320, the C70 and the 330Ci as competition so I understand (the 320 and the C70 are softer everyone said).

At Wide Open Throtle and slightly turning, torque steer is evident but not intrusive.  It will never surpise you but you know it is there.  The double wishbone suspension feels like it locks the wheels wherever you are pointing so there is no danger.  Plus you know you got the VSA to monitor your tragectory if you need help in a case like that.

The VSA is working overtime when the road is wet.  Of course that happens because I feel super confident and while standing still and ready to turn, I hammer it so that I start as fast as possible off the line (not much can go wrong when going from 0mph to 25mph as fast as possible when no one is around).  That makes the VSA work overtime because there is 232 pounds of torque on the front (only) 215mm wide all-season tires while being on a wet road.  When the VSA is in action, a big yellow triangular light goes off in the dash so it is easy to see.  I like that because I see my car's safety systems/hardware in action, real time.  I am sure I will see this more during the winter on the snow.

Talking about the VSA a disadvantage here is that you have to stick with the same exact size of tires when time comes for a change or the VSA will not work properly (it is in the manual and it makes sense).  The VSA processes a number of variables but the total diameter of the wheel and tire together is a fixed number to the VSA's algorythm.  So the only way to possibly end up with wider tires is to change the wheels as well so that the total diameter of wheel and tire is identical to the stock diameter.  Actually, it seems to me that switching to a different size tire, you might be creating a dangerous situation for you because the VSA might actually do something that will throw the car off balance...hmmm..

I still cannot get used to the auto tranny.  This engine is wasted with this setup.  Also, it does not feel as the max torque comes from 3500rpm to 5500rpm according to Acura (I am sure that is the case though).  It seems as the strong points are very low rpm torque (off the line) and once you pass the 4850rpm mark.

On the other hand sometimes I picture myself shifting about a million times a day and thanking that auto.  Is the sequential auto shifter the best solution?  Probably, but with shorter gearing.  First, second and third are quite well ranged but 4th is just too long.  5th is super long but I would not change that as you would lose the quite cruising.  Maybe if 2nd, 3rd and 4th come closer together (less for 2nd and 3rd but much more for the 4th gear), things would have been better.

I still cannot get over this engine's sound once 5000rpm is reached and all the way to the red line.  Like looks, sound is also subjective but I just love this engine's sound.

For those that want to cruise quitely at 80mph, THIS is the car to do it in, in this category.  At 80mph the tach shows 2200rpm!  The motor feels like it is electric there.  Plus the good padding helps.

For those that dont like the cloth seats because they are not leather but also dont like the leather seats because your back sweats like crazy during the summer (not to mention sliding left and right because of that fact), and because your back never gets warm enough during the winter (especially here when we see minus 40 degree weather), I have the perfect solution for you.  PERFORATED LEATHER!  I was blown away by how this solved all the problems I had with my previous car with its leather seats.  I thought it was a gimmick.  The perforated leather (standard only in the Type S) kills 2 birds with one stone.  Because it has holes, it breathes much better during the summer which eliminates the sweating problem and on top of that, because of these holes it increases the friction factor so your body does not slide.  Of course the &quot;being cold during the winter&quot; problem is solved with the heated seats option standard in the Type S which I LOVE!

The car is super solid.  Great job with the subframe setup absorbing all the unwanted shocks and bringing in the cabin a stiff, controled feeling that makes you think that you always know what is happening on the road.

I wish those outside mirrors were also auto dim like the inside mirror (the S4 has that feature).  On the other hand though, they are the biggest outside mirrors I have seen in a car like this and they give you great visability utilizing that size...good job here.

I love the range on the remote.  You can open the trunk/doors from &quot;half a mile&quot; away.

I love the Xenon lights.  This is not a gimmick.  It really works and everyone can see you extremely well night or day.  When I bring the high scale lights (which are not Xenon HID) on, the range I can see forward does not increase.  It intensifies and I can see upwards better but not straight.  That tells you how bright the light is coming out of the Xenon
lights at the regular scale.  There are a couple of super expensive luxury cars that have Xenon capability for the high scale light setting.  I wonder how far you can see with those!

I cant tell I am doing 115mph (in fourth gear).  The car feels the same at 70-80-90-100-115mph (not that I am saying I have done that in public streets).  Supposedly the top speed is 147mph.

Now only if there was a Type R out 2 years down the road.  All we need is 20% stiffer suspension, 30 more HP, 20 pounds more torque, a manual 6 speed tranny, 235X45X17 summer tires, 200 pounds off and an aero kit with appropricate badging to defferentiate.  All that for another $7,500 and you have beaten the M3.<br><br>
