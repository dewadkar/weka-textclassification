I bought this camera after doing extensive research (on the web) and after reading all the rave reviews.  I wanted quality and something that wasn't bulky.  I also considered the Nikon Coolpix, but opted for the Olympus because it was a little more portable.  Plus, the price was right ($555 at mobshop.com)

I just couldn't believe how sharp and clear the pictures came out.  You can use the point and shoot (automatic) or if you're more of a photographer, the manual mode, where you can set the aperture, shutter speed, exposure, etc.

The design of the camera is very intuitive.  I got the camera working (after charging the batteries) in no time.  I especially love how you can zoom into your picture on the LED with the zoom lever.  The serial connection isn't as bad as everyone says.  It takes about 30 seconds per 1600x1200 picture to download via serial.  I'm usually in no rush, so waiting 30 minutes for 60 pictures isn't too bad.  Just catch a sitcom or something while waiting.  If you're in a rush, buy the USB card reader for $80.

Be careful with the camera though.  Make sure you take the lens cap off before turning on the camera.  Or you'll get a grinding lens noise, which can't be good.  I was also disappointed that no carrying case came with such an expensive unit.

Other than that, you'll have a great time taking pictures.
