            This automobile is the funnest thing i have ever drove. I love to ride down the street with the wind in your hair. When driving a Jeep is Fun it is also stylish. The feeling of rolling is there but the newer design's and longer wheel base almost eliminate the risk of tipping. The handling is great and u can turn on a dime. One thing that bothers me is chance of someone stealing something out of your jeep. That is NOT a reason to worry about if ur deciding to buy a jeep though. All together I would recomend (if u have the cash) a Sahara because of the luxuries inside. GOOD BUY!!!
