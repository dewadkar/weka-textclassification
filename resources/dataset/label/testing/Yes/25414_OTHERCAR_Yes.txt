            Advertising for the Buick Park Avenue concentrates on the luxury of the vehicle. The comfort and amenities of the car were factors that attracted me to it. The driver's seat has memory seats, both front seats are heated, the climate control system has separate adjustments for the passenger side, and many functions can be controlled through switches on the steering wheel. When I took delivery of the 1999 vehicle, the memory seats did not work properly, and I had to return it three times for repair. During manufacture several of the control circuits were shorted, and the mechanic had to track the problem down for repair. Minor inconveniences of this type have distracted from the pleasure of having a larger car. The problem can be corrected, but I have heard that others have experienced the same problem. When the memory seat operates correctly it includes not only positions for two drivers, but an exit position for ease of exit and entry--a benefit for anyone having difficulty getting into and out of cars.
Once the problem was repaired, I found the car comfortable and easy to drive. The ride is typical large GM, with a suspension that is on the soft side--right for the person who want a large car luxury ride, but not acceptable for the performance driver. The result is an automobile that is right for the middle age set looking for space and ease of operation. I moved to the car from a smaller vehicle and have owned a variety of foreign automobiles.
During the three months I have driven the car, I have found it to be a pleasure; however, I still have a smaller car when I want the performance feel.<br><br>
