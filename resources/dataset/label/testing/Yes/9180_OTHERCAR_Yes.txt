            The RAV4 is a great offering from Toyota. Small size, good fuel economy with a comfortable ride and neat handling. This rugged little car takes the bumps better than my husband's larger XTerra. The only disappointment  about this car's handling is the extremely wide turning radius, surprising in such a small vehicle. Despite this problem, the car is very manuverable. It's great for quick lane changes and is very peppy on the highway. The heater cranks out the heat and the standard sound system is adequate, with good placement of the speakers and accessible, easy-to-understand controls. Audiophiles may want to spring for a beefier system. The dash is well laid out. All controls are easy to see and operate.

I have the manual transmission model, which is very responsive. The shift into second is substantially further down than in my VW GTI and I released the clutch too soon several times before getting comfortable with the new pattern. Otherwise, it's a nice, tight pattern and with ratios that meet highway needs and quick starts when you need low-end power.

The safety features of the RAV4 -- extra heavy motor fittings, fire wall between the engine and passenger compartments and a skid plate for off-roading make it a great car for a small family even if it's never taken off the road. Families with more than two young kids, or with teenagers  may not find the backseat comfortable for long trips, but we've successfully carted around four full-sized adults with no comfort issues arising.  I haven't explored all the offroad capabilities of my RAV yet, but have been very impressed when I've had to take the car across construction sites and through unimproved parking lots.

Overall -- Anyone searching for a small, fuel-efficient and environmentally responsible (read low emissions) vehicle will be very happy with the RAV4.<br><br>
