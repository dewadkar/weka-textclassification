            This is the perfect family vehicle. The space in the vehicle easily sits seven adults. You can cram in more but the seat belts are just for seven. The interior is spacious and has very little bounce when driving. The storage area behind the back seat is great for groceries bikes etc.
The vehicle looks new even when 4 years old. The mercury Villager needs nothing but yearly matienence. We have front and back air conditioning and heating. The people in the back can maintain their own temperature setting.  Their are headset plugins in the rear so that kids can listen to the radio or cds while the front passengers get quiet to talk.
All in All a very safe reliable vehicle. Our next minivan will definitely be a Villager.<br><br>
