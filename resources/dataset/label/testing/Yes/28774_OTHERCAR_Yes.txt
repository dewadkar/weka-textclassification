            I have owned many digital cameras, but this is the first one that will pretty much replace my film camera.  

This is definitely not the smallest 3 megapixel camera on the market.  However, my number one concern is picture quality.  Not all 3 megapixel cameras are created equal.  Many people make the mistake of thinking that the only important thing about a digital camera is the resolution.  Not so!  Just as with a 35mm or APS film camera, there are many other things to consider.  

The Sony DSC-S75 includes a 3x optical zoom Carl Zeiss F-2 lens.  This is a fantastic, fast lens for a point & shoot camera.  The small sperture allows for nice looking portraits with a short depth of field (sharp subject, blurry background).  The focal distance is comparable to a 35m camera with a 34-102mm zoom.  The advertised "6x Zoom" is achieved by applying a digital 2x zoom.  Digital zoom is all but useless.  You would get the same result by "zooming in" on the image after downloading to your computer.  Fortunately, you have the option of disabling the digital zoom in the SET UP menu on this camera.  

This was the first digital camera to utilize 14 bit analog to digital conversion.  The result is a superior image with better color.  There are two selectable compression modes, normal and fine.  Both produce great images.  When in fine mode, you will be able to hold less than half as many images than in normal, but you may notice a slight reduction in compression artifacts.  As with any digicam, I would suggest that the highest quality mode always be used.  You may need to buy more memory cards, but you'll have better pictures.

The battery.  This is another area that is often overlooked.  After owning a few Sony digital cameras, I can safely say that they have the best batteries.  Their InfoLithium batteries charge quickly and last a long time.  With both of the Sony's I use, I keep the screen on all the time.  The DSC-S75's battery can last almost 3 hours with the screen on.  It also tells you how much longer the batter will last (in minutes).  My old Olympus digicam can't last for 15 or 20 minutes with the screen turned on.  Yes, the Sony has an optical viewfinder... however, it's much easier to frame your picture properly if you use the screen.

Manual modes.  This camera allows aperture priority, shutter priority, and fully manual modes.  There are also modes for manual focus and for setting ISO speed.  Another great feature is the manual white balance.  Great for getting correct color tones is odd lighting situations.  

There is a one-touch feature for reviewing the last picture taken.  While viewing images, you can zoom in up to 5x.  Great for checking focus or other details.  The camera also stores aperture, shutter, and other information for each image.  If you take a picture is full-auto mode and don't like the results, you'll know where to begin in manual mode to correct it.

VOICE mode.  This mode records an audio file along with the image.  It records sound for 5 seconds, or for as long as you hold the shutter button (up to 40 seconds).  This is great for capturing the atmosphere at a party, or for leaving your personal notes about the image.

Video recording.  This camera is capable of recording video clips at 15 frames per second.  In the highest quality mode, clips are limited to 14 seconds.  Any other mode allows you to record until the memory stick is full.  Audio is recorded in all video modes except for CLIP MOTION, which is more like making stop-motion animation.  Clip motion puts up to 10 pictures together as an animated GIF file.  This is neat for putting on web pages.

USB connectivity.  Most new digital cameras connect to the USB port on a home computer.  This is no exception.  The USB cable included with the camera quickly transfers images to the computer.  Windows XP users will not need drivers, as Windows XP will automatically recognize the camera as a removable drive (it will show up under My Computer).  Simply drag the images onto the hard drive (My Pictures, Desktop, etc...).

The flash can be forces on, forced off, or set to automatically fire.  The flash level can easily be set to low, normal, or high.  There is also an optional flash for this camera (Sony FVL-F1000) which offers TTL metering and bounce flash capabilities.  I have already ordered mine (about $80-$100 street value).

Another neat accessory is a 52mm adapter ring.  This allows standard 52mm filters or a Sony wide angle converter to be used.

Picure quality is exceptional.  Color is very true.  This camera handles dimly lit conditions very well.  In macro mode, objects can be photographed from less than 2 inches away.  

I cannot say enough about this camera.  As with film cameras, the quality of pictures froma digicam cannot be evaluated on the bases of the "numbers" alone.  You must see the result in order to accurately judge the camera's abilities.  

I suggest visiting www.steves-digicams.com before making any digicam purchase.  This site is extremely informative and offers sample pictures from nearly every digital camera on the market.
