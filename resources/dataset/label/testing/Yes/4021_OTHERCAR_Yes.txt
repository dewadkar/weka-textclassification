            There's no sign of the SUV craze letting up.  Even with gas prices nearing $2 per gallon in some areas, SUV sales are still strong. The new Tahoe is one reason for those soaring sales.

The Tahoe is a big truck, smaller than a Suburban (but what isn't), and much larger than the Dodge Durango. Styling is not quite as bold as the Dodge line of trucks, but the Tahoe still looks good (especially from the side).

The interior is well thought out with storage bins, little cubby holes, and three power outlets up front. Seats are among the most comfortable in any SUV, and adjust in so many ways, only the crankiest of drivers would find reason to complain. The center console storage bin is so wide and deep, you could easily become a pack-rat.  A sunroof/moonroof is nice in a truck this size.  Gauges are large, clear and logical - most secondary information is conveyed through smaller analog gauges - a welcome change from the standard idiot lights. Like most new cars, it's the little things which get your attention.  Lighted window switches for rear seat passengers, lighted sunroof switch and exterior lights that shine on the ground when exiting, are all examples of little things that make the Tahoe seem a lot more friendly.

The 2000 Tahoe rides very "UN-trucky," you can tell it's a truck, but the ride is car-like, almost as smooth as the Toyota Tundra. Handling is EXCELLENT considering how high the Tahoe rides. It's no sports car, but the Tahoe's handling and stability give the driver great confidence. Acceleration is average, exactly what you'd expect for a truck this size and a V-8 with 350 cubic inches (5.7L).  Brakes are a little soft, but they do stop the vehicle without any problems.  There is a lot of pedal travel, but it doesn't feel dangerous.

Ultimately a truck like the Tahoe is all about utility - the Tahoe is very versatile.  In one configuration 7 adults can ride in relative comfort, remove the rear seats, fold down the center seats, and you'll have about as much storage space as some minivans.  Best of all, the conversion from people mover to cargo hauler is easy.  The rear seats have levers marked 1, 2, 3 - and yes it is that easy.  Rear seats even come with handles to make carrying a breeze, as well as small, built in wheels, to make installation and removal easier.  Center seats fold down in a manner that could only be called simple. In all there are about 10 different ways to configure the seats and cargo area - it's very useful.

Overall the new 2000 Tahoe is a great car/truck/SUV. It's useful in so many situations, and does it all with a surprising level of luxury. Car- like ride, with truck ruggedness; what else could you want.

On the down side --  Although the Tahoe starts at a meager $27,000, add the usual options and you'll soon be crowding the high $30's.  Forty thousand dollars is a lot of money, luckily you'll get a lot of truck.
