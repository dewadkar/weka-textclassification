            Test drove several cars (Celica GT-S, Acura RSX S, etc.) and the WRX just blew them away all-around!  Hard to believe a $25,000 sedan is such a race car.  Car of the Year in 2002 and Top 10 Car every year since (major auto magazines.)

Acceleration is great above 3000 rpm.  The acceleration curve is so smooth you won't realize how fast you are going if you don't look at the speedometer.  60 mph comes faster than you think!

Handling is exceptional but there is too much understeer (front end slides on turns) if you plan to do any spirited driving in twisties.  I put a larger 22mm rear sway bay on my sedan and now steering is "neutral."

Safe car, lots of room.  I thought I would never drive a 4-door but I am so glad I did.  My previous two cars were the 1991 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX and the Datsun 280Z.  The WRX is my favorite of the three by a mile!

WRX comes with 3 catalytic converters: one before the turbo in the uppipe, one after the turbo in the downpipe, and one in the midpipe.  These cats, combined with a narrow exhaust piping, do rob the engine of some power.  Do yourself a favor, and get an aftermarket full turbo-back exhaust.  The downpipe cat will be gone and the mid-pipe cat will be hi-flow.  Your car will still be emission safe but will get an immediate 25HP.

There are only two complaints:  the paint chips VERY easily and the stock stereo and speakers are VERY weak.  You'll need to replace those if you want to hear your music with the windows down.

The best Web site to learn about the WRX is:

You'll see, we all LOVE our WRX's!  :-)
