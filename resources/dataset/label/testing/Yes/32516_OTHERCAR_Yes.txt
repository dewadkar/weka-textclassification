            As a former race driver I try to stay with cars that have
reasonably good handling and acceleration.  This Audi A6 Avant comes close to being perfect, at least in the "wagon"
category.  My only complaint is that the gear selection seems to not be an even sequence.  In other words, 4th and
5th gear seems to be a little tall, compared with the lower
gears.  I like gears to go up in equal increments.  They might have done this to give better high speed MPG.
I'm also a retired Human Factors Engineer (ergonomics, etc.)
and really appreciate the great job they did on the driver's
layout.  Night driving is a blast with all the small red lights everywhere!  Seat comfort is excellent.  My only suggestion to Audi (and other car makers) is to put in a digital speedometer.  I've owned and driven other cars that had this feature and it is far superior to the old fashion analog speedometer.  The oil temperature gauge is a nice touch, but I would also like to have an oil pressure gauge.
A warning light would come on if needed but it's nice to get
information earlier.  Several times I have accidentally activated the windshield wipers because the stalk is a little too close to the steering wheel.  I know this sounds like I'm nit picking but this car is so good that you want to push it into the "perfect" category.  I know there is no such thing as a perfect car, and there will never be one.
We sold a '91 Mercedes 560SEC to get this car and are very pleased with its similar high quality fit and finish.  The quality of the leather, the wood trim, the Bose radio, etc.
is really first class.
I really wanted an A6 Avant with a V8 but didn't want the
S6 because here in California we have some roads worse than
some third-world countries!  17" wheels with a sport suspension might be fun on the smooth roads in Germany but
in California it will shake, rattle and roll.  I understand
that in Europe they do produce an A6 Avant with a V8, 16" wheels, and a normal suspension.  I believe this would be a great selling model here in the states.  I can see the 17",
18" wheels and sport suspensions being proper for some of the hot rods that Audi produces, but come on....how many
50 year old guys are going to play Rickey Racer with a wagon!  Other than the little complaints I mentioned I really like this "silver arrow".  Besides it looks great
parked next to my silver Porsche 928S4.  Happy motoring...
