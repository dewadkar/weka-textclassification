            This camera has replaced my 35mm forever.  

Ease of use

This camera is really easy to use.  You can just about throw the instruction manual away when you get the camera.  Downloads to the computer were a little difficult to setup at first, however, they are not too hard.

Picture quality

The picture quality is outstanding.  I have tried taking pictures of books (the text is clear).  In light and dark, near and far, the camera produces good colors and good brightness.  The resolution is outstanding.

Software

My one possible objection.  On a fast machine the editing software is klunky and slow.  Better software is cheap and not hard to find so this is not hard to overcome.

Accessories

The memory technology is fast and reasonably affordable to expand (you will need to - the memory 8MB that comes with the camera only holds 7 or 8 full res pictures).  The battery lasts about 70 minutes - but is rechargeable out of the box.  In most situations I find that this is worth about two days of intensive picture taking.

All in all a great product.
