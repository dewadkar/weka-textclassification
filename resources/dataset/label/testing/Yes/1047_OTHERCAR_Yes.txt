            My husband and I bought our Jeep in Oct., but instead of a new one, we bought a 1998 model. Price wasn't really our main concern. My reason for wanting the 1998 model, was the that the new ones have a rounded front end, and I prefer the more &quot;boxy&quot; look.

 Our Jeep had 28K miles on it when we bought it, and it now has about 34,500 on it. I've never had a problem with it. It drives smoothly with minimal road noise, and steers easily. It has what is referred to as a &quot;straight 6&quot; vs. a V6. 

As we were negotiating with the dealer, we notice some paint problems with the hood. It looked like tiny little cracked areas. We pointed this out to our salesman, and he had the body man look at it. They decided that it was a factory defect, and repainted our hood with no fuss at all. The paint job looks great, and perfectly matches the rest of the vehicle. 

I also like the interior. It's charcoal velour, and very comfortable. Overall, we are extremely happy with our purchase. I'd recommend a Jeep to anyone shopping for an SUV.<br><br>
