            A sturdy little camera.  Excellent for family use but most definitely not a professional tool. 

As a genuine gadget freak, an artist, and a technoid, I've been tuning into the digital camera scene since 1997.  Things have changed a lot! 

Working with for-print digital graphics, I didn't want to invest the money until the resolution was good enough to magnify by a factor of 10 without losing all image coherency. The Olympus D-400 Zoom was an excellent foray into this technology.  It is light and sturdy enough to carry on day trips.  It's also so easy to use that it's *almost* as &quot;point and shoot&quot; as traditional 35mm automatic film cameras.  

On the downside, it took a call to Sony's customer service to FIND the right drivers to get set up to download pictures from the camera to the computer.  If you're on a trip and can't haul along a computer, you're restricted to the memory on the smartcard (8 MEG standard).  The option for &quot;extra film&quot; is to buy another smartcard. I did this eventually to have a backup, and to allow me to take more high resolution images when I was out shooting.  

Despite the luxury of &quot;seeing&quot; the pictures immediately, it's tough to tell how they're going to look when you're editing them on your computer, or printing them out - so immediately deleting all but the best isn't the ultimate solution your family's shutter bug once thought. The 16 MEG smartcard set me back $90.  Pretty expensive film unless I use this camera for years... which I won't. 

A major beef I have with this camera is lack of lighting control.  This camera shoots like a 35mm with 100 ASA film with the F-stop stuck at 250. If ambient light isn't good, or the subject isn't in a sufficiently enclosed space for the flash to fill out the space, the auto-focus flakes out.  Unfortunately, your ability to manually adjust exposure is extremely limited. 

Another issue is image color.  As a graphic designer, color fidelity is a big issue for me.  The D-400 does not do well with the warmer end of the spectrum, mangling yellows and oranges.  It is also programmed to compensate for low light conditions by extrapolating with red tones. With the D-400's results, white... rarely is.  

This camera isn't the end of the line for me, but it's been fun to play with. I'd recommend it for personal use.  If you're going to run your images through the digital grinder... look further.<br><br>
