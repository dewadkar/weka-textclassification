            First, I've only had my 2001 Honda Accord LX for only 4 days, so naturally I'm still in the "honeymoon" phase of owning this car.

After test driving several cars over the weekend, my husband and I decided to pick the ones we liked the best, not only for handling, styling, color, but also cost.  This means that we also test drove "demo" models and "used" models too.

We test drove a 2001 Honda Accord EX, that was loaded with a 6-disc CD changer, cassette tape player, remote key access, security system, moonroof, and several other options that I just can't seem to remember.  (This car did not have leather seats and with kids, leather seats are NOT a priority!)

We ultimately decided on a "demo" 2001 Honda Accord LX.  It was in the dealer showroom and was "on sale."  It had 5500 miles on it, so that was the reason for the reduced price.  The sticker on the demo was in the neighborhood of $21K, however since it was "on sale," we got it for less than the advertised "sale price."  We paid roughly $17,500 for this car.

My 2001 Honda Accord LX has some of the same accessories that was on my trade-in, which was a 1992 Nissan Maxima, so I feel that I haven't gone down in options by taking the "demo."  I really like the sunglasses storage compartment, located near the map lights.  I like the upper and lower console sections.  The upper section has a change holder and the lower section is large enough for my purse.

I love the lighted mirror on the sunvisors and I've never had a car that had the extendable piece on the sunvisor.  Standard in all 2000 and 2001 cars, is the "tether strap" anchors.  (Since I have a 2 year old, this is something that I'm using with his car-seat!)  Also standard in the 2001 models is the universal car seat brackets.  These are for car seats that have the new piece that comes out of the bottom and slide onto the bracket to lock into place.  Of course, you would still use the tether strap anchors too.

Cup-holders galore!  I have 2 cup holders in the front console and in the center of the backseat, the arm-rest comes down and has 2 cups holders built in.  The backseat also has shoulder belts for the 3 passengers in back.  (Of course you can't use the cup holders in back if you have 3 passengers in back!)

Another feature that I've got with this car that I've never had before, is a "valet key."  Not that I plan to use "valet" parking, but I must admit that I do like having this option.

The backseat can be lowered for access to the trunk and the armrest in the backseat, when lowered has a way to pass through to the trunk too.  Both of these options require a key and the "valet" key does not work in these locks.

Another feature that I've got with car is a "Maintenance Required" light.  Every 7,500 miles this light will come on to remind me that it is time for the suggested maintenance.  The owner's manual has a list of the suggested maintenance.  The one drawback to this light is that you do have to go in to have the switch reset so that the light will go off.  Basically, take the car in and have the oil changed and tell them that the light is on.

The handling thus far has been great.  (As luck would have it, it poured down rain on the first day I had the car!)  The seats are comfortable and my kids have plenty of room in the backseat.  (My oldest son is 9 1/2 years old, so having plenty of leg room is an issue!)  My husband also rode in the backseat, just to see if it would be comfortable for an adult.  He said that he had plenty of room and the ride felt really smooth.

Even though the car we purchased has the 4 cylinder, it has plenty of power and after test driving both the 4 and the V6, it was really hard to tell the difference.  (The Maxima we traded had a Twin Cam V6.)  

Okay, now let me tell you the real reason we got the LX instead of the EX.  First and foremost, the LX was the better deal.  Since it was a "demo," the price was substantially lower since it had been "used."  The dealer really couldn't come down any further on the price of the EX, which had a sticker price around $23,500.  We also got a higher price on our trade-in (1992 Maxima with almost 200,000 miles and damage from an accident last year), because they really wanted to sell the demo.

For the difference in price, I'm happy with my 2001 Honda Accord LX.  (I also had my eye on a 2000 Nissan Maxima - demo model -- but the deal I got from the Honda dealer was too good to pass up!)  

So after reading all of this, I know you must be asking yourself -- Why should I buy a Honda Accord?  

1.  The Honda Accord is an economical car -- from the aspect of maintenance, gas, and purchase price.

2.  The Honda (if maintained) should last for several hundred thousand miles, which means that once paid for, you shouldn't need another new car for quite some time.

3.  This is a great car for anyone, but especially for a family.  For everyday use, you couldn't ask for a better car.  If you need or want something more "luxurious" for a long trip, you can rent a luxury sedan -- at least you won't have those huge payments nor have a gas hog of a car for everyday use!

On a personal note, hubby and I have planned to hand this car down to our oldest son when he is old enough to drive.  (By that time, this car will be 6 years old and should be a great first car for him!)  

****UPDATE -- April 2, 2001********************************
Okay, I've had my car for 2 weeks now, so now I can share the gas mileage that I'm getting right now on my 2001 Honda Accord LX.  I made a trip to visit my parents and my in-laws -- they live nearly 200 miles from me.  On that trip, which was all interstate driving, I got 34 mpg.

Driving around town (Nashville rush-hour traffic) over the last week, I got 24.5 mpg.

Overall, I think that's pretty good mileage.
