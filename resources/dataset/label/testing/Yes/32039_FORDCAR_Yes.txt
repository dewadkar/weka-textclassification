            We have a '96 Ford Explorer, limited.  We bought the vehicle because it had all the extra's at the time.  The Explorer has the 5 changer diskman, leather bucket seats, cell phone &lt;built in&gt;.  At night when you drive the car the control panel looks like the control panel of airplane.  We were amazed with the buttons and gadgets the first night we drove it.  The gas milage has been reasonable.  About 17 in town and 22 on the highway.
 
My family has really enjoyed this car.  The only draw back is the CD player skips at times.  We've had the unit replaced 3 times.  Also it does not have the room that our Suburban had.  But never the less we have enjoyed it.
I would recommend this car to all my friends.<br><br>
