            The MX-6 was my second Mazda purchase.  I bought it in 1995 at the age of 18.  I was in a big hurry because I fell in love with the car as soon as I saw it.  In my book, it didn't compare with anything else available at the time as far as roominess and looks.

<b>Engine</b>

My MX-6 came equipped with the 2.5L V-6 that is standard with the LS package.  This engine was really pretty quick, and I never had much trouble giving grief to the Accord/Integra/Celica class when out driving around looking for trouble.  I didn't have any problems specifically related to the engine while I owned the car, with the exception of the &quot;Check Engine&quot; idiot light being on constantly.  I took the car to the dealership to have it looked into, but the tech guys told me that there was some kind of a problem with the warning system (the 1993 was the first try at the &quot;2nd generation&quot; MX-6) that had affected some cars before being hammered out mid-production run.  After they told my financially impaired self that it would be about $175/hour to hook it up to the computer and run the codes, and that after taking it for a test drive and spot check they didn't believe there to be anything wrong, I learned to ignore the light and change the oil at the recommended intervals.

<b>Drivetrain</b>

A little to the rear of the engine, the automatic transmission, was a whole other headache however.  I purchased the vehicle at 59,000 miles when it was only two years old.  Asked about the mileage, I was told by the &quot;typical used-car salesman&quot; (no disrespect to the honest ones out there) that the car had been owned by an old couple who lived in Northwestern Wisconsin and had a 45 minute highway commute each direction to/from work.  I was assured the car was well maintained, and I actually have no reason to believe that it wasn't.  The problem is, I felt anyway, that I enjoyed driving the car a little too much.  I was driving about 700 miles per weekend to visit friends in Iowa (I lived in Northern Minnesota) and when the car finally died, it had 108,000 miles on it -- only six months after I'd purchased it.  What happened?  On the return trip from Iowa to Duluth, I noticed a kind of whistling sound while driving down the interstate.  It didn't seem to be anything serious, and for once the &quot;Check Engine&quot; light wasn't on, so I ignored it.  I spend the night at home that evening, drove through town to get on the freeway, and headed down the on-ramp.  When the car went to shift into overdrive (4th gear), the tachometer headed straight to the redline and the vehicle quit pulling ahead.  I pulled to the shoulder, put the car in Park and then immediately back into drive and took off again.  Same thing happened.  I pretty quickly realized that the car wasn't going to let me go much over 30 without the transmission starting to slip.  I got off the road and headed straight to a transmission repair shop.  They test drove it and the problem re-occurred for them, so they opened the transaxle up and took a look.  Essentially, there was a pile of metal shavings at the bottom of the case, and it was then assumed that it was whatever makes fourth gear work.  They quoted me a $3000 replacement price.  Suffice it to say, I told them &quot;no sale.&quot;

<b>Interior/Styling</b>

I loved the styling of this car, both inside and out.  I'm an interior guy because that's what I'm looking at while I'm driving.  The car was exceptionally comfortable, and I was much happier being behind the wheel than not.  I'm about 6'3&quot; and a pretty big guy, and I had no complaints at all about roominess during my 6 hour trips twice a week.  The instruments are very non-confrontational and clear, and most of the controls are pretty easily reached without being unintentionally manipulated.  The outside of the car is very smart looking.  The car is essentially the same as the Ford Probe mechanically, but the sheet metal is obviously a little different (no pop-up headlights, no cheesy hatchback).  With the car having spent its lifecycle in Northern Minnesota since it had been born, there was suprisingly no rust to be found anywhere, at least up until the time I got rid of it.  One other feature I loved on this car, was that I could have the sunroof open year-round, and with the way it was set-up, you wouldn't get any air in the car unless the side windows were down.  

<b>Handling/Performance</b>

This car handled very well, even for hard-core winter driving.  It could corner on a very tight radius, and gripped the road well on high G-force corners with the stock wheels/tires I had on it.  The car was getting around 20-25 mpg for me on the highway, and I used &quot;Silver&quot; level gas pretty consistently without any knocking problems or the like.  As far as quickness, I would say between 7-8 seconds for the 0-60, and I had the car up to 125mph once based on the stock speedometer on an open track.

<b>In Summary</b>

I've rated this car 5 stars because I don't believe that it had an inherent problem that caused the transmission failure, and there were no other mechanical difficulties while I owned it.  The car was put through about four times its duty cycle in it's two and half years of existence, which is hard on any vehicle.  When I unloaded the car, it went back to the dealer, and I found it listed in the paper with a new transmission put in it and selling for about $4000 less than I paid for it originally.  All in all, I'd buy one again and have actually test-drove identical ones a couple of times, both for old-times sake and considering a purchase.

On a personal note, I posted two Mazda reviews today beacuse I noticed Mazda has agreed to study their product line due to a lack of recent sales.  I feel it's a real shame that Mazda (or really anyone other than Honda) doesn't put out a comparable mid-level car like the MX-6 anymore.  The MX-6 is a great blend of style and sensibility for the money, and as it's in a class above Cavalier/Neon/Civic, but below BMW 3-Series and equivalent, the only options are an Accord, Solara or Alero/Intrigue, and I don't care for any of those.  I implore Mazda to get back to building appealing cars that are a close price/value match, or at least resume importing the RX-7.<br><br>
