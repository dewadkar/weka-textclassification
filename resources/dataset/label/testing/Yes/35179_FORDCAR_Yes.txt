            I owned an Escort several years ago, and I didn't care for it mainly because of a bad 3-speed transmission. But now, with the new Escort, it's like a totally different car.
 I considered this car, at first, mostly because of the price. I purchased this new Escort a couple months ago(I already have 10,000 miles on it), and it is the best compact I have ever had. The engine is quite fast and the features for the price are out of this world. I have air, automatic, power locks, power doors, power mirrors, rear defrost, car alarm, etc.. It is the best equipped car for the price. 
 I checked out a Saturn, Cavalier, Honda Civic, Hyundi, Dodge Neon, etc., and nothing came with the features and a better price. It has a smooth shifting transmission and the handling is top notch.
 The only shortcomings are stiff seats(go for the extra comfort seats).
Otherwise, I have no complaints. If you need a small car and you are on a budget, you can not beat this car. It is also well-reviewed by other consumer mags, so ask around and you will see that everyone loves this little car. Ford was actually going to discontinue the Escort, but with the new design, it has been a huge success and they are keeping it. Buy it now!
