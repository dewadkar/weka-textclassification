            Well, what can I say about the Honda Accord.  For years it has been one of the top selling sedans in the U.S.  Maybe that's what led me to buy my first one in 1997 (it was a lightly used 1996 model).  Below are my opinons about the car:

Overall Quality: 9 out of 10.  A very solidly built car.  Honda has a reputation for quality and it shows.  All components are well made and the car is solid.

Engine:  7 out of 10.  My biggest pet peeve, the 2.2L standard engine is adequate, but not outstanding.  Highly reliable and underpowered.  I like a car to GOOO when I step on it and this one basically drags.  Absolutely no mechanical problems, but no fun either.

Interior:  8 out of 10.  Good quality.  Comfortable seats.  All controls are well laid out and within reach.  Only problem is that the above mentioned engine delivers quite a bit of noise into the cabin.  Maybe the EX model includes better sound insulation.

Handling:  8 out of 10.  Very comfortable, but not a sports car.  The car goes where you point it, but with some understeer.
