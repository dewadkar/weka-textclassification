            I purchased a white grand am two door just over a year ago. Looks nice. Engine runs nice. Never needs endless amounts of oil. I have the oil changed faithfully every 3 mths without ever adding oil. Gas mileage is not bad. 
I've read before about this car having issues with the heater/AC blower motor or lack of sufficient air flow. Well, that's definitely an issue with this car. I just had the blower replaced due to horrible noise it was causing. It didn't improve the airflow in the least. The next day I had the evaporative core (for the AC, heater core is behind) washed out and it made all the difference in the world. For those of you who are having the same problem, take it to a knowledgable mechanic to have the blower housing removed and the core pressure washed out, slowly so as to not have overflow end up inside the car. It takes about 2 hours to do properly.

The other issue with this car is the non-power windows. It wasn't too long before they broke, or went off the rollers. I haven't had them fixed...yet. I'm sure it'll cost more than I want to spend. 

Lastly, the blind spots in this car are horrible! If you put the head rest where its supposed to be at for added safety...you can't see a thing when shoulder checking! There have been plenty of times where I haven't seen oncoming cars when turning due to the large blind spots in the windshield as well.

Aside from these issues, I quite enjoy driving my car and would love to purchase a newer one when this one runs its course.
