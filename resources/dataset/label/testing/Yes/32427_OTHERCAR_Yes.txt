            This was my fifth Honda and the second one that my family has bought brand new -- but this one was all mine! I love the interior of all Honda's but this SE model was well equipped with CD player - which I upgraded to an in trunk 6-CD changer. Additions such as alloy rims and a sporty fin really made this a fun car to drive. Being Canadian winter weather driving ability is very important. I felt safe and confident in the front wheel drive ability of this vehicle. I would suggest winter tread tires for a &quot;go anywhere&quot; experience. There was really nothing that I would change about this car.

Driving the SE model was enjoyable. Climate controlled comfort, it handles the roads great and it has a racing car feel as well.

I recommend this vehicle as a second family car and as a first time car for the up and coming executive/management level woman. Given that the seats sit lower in the car and the two door makes is difficult for people with mobility issues to get in and out of the back seat, I would not recommend this vehicle to people with mobility issues.

My advice is to try it -- you will not be disappointed.<br><br>
