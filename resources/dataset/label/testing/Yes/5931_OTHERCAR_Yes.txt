            One of the most overlooked and underestimated sports cars in the world!  The Porsche 928GT is a front engine rear drive platform with an all aluminum V-8 engine with 32 valves and 4 camshafts that produces 330bhp, mated to a five speed transaxle which is located between the rear wheels of the car.  That means an even 50/50 weight distribution (f/r) and outstanding handling for a car that weighs 3600 lbs.  It is capable of 0-60mph times of 5.6 seconds and quarter mile time of 14.1 seconds.  Top speed is 171mph.  

Now for the driving impression.  when you sit in the low slung seat of a 928 you can tell that this car is made to drive hard.  The seats are some of the most comfortable seats you will ever sit in but will not let you budge when you take a corner at a pace that would scare a normal person.  the control is amazing thanks in part to the weight distribution and the Weissach rear axle, which adjusts the toe-in of the rear wheels under deceleration to prevent understeer.  A little weird the first time you feel it but you grow to appreciate it as you get used to driving it.  The acceleration is nothing short of amazing with a torque curve as flat as the back of your hand.  The car pulls strong in any gear and begs to be driven at 100 mph or more all day long.  This is a Grand Touring car that thinks its a sports car.  The 5.0 litre V-8 will not let you down when you want to drive from Los Angeles to Miami or just up the block to pick up a copy of Excellence.  If you drive it long enough, you're going to get a speeding ticket, cops love these things and its easy to catch yourself doing 110mph on an empty highway because the car is so smooth at speed.  The styling is timeless and draws lots of attention wherever you go.  Most people don't even know what it is! 

As with any car, there are drawbacks to the 928.  Its tough to drive it in the city, its a freeway car through and through.  It has stiff, but speed sensitive steering that makes low speed maneuvering a little hard at times.  Gas mileage is less than impressive, but thats not why you buy these cars.  The maintainance on a Porsche 928 can be expensive if you don't keep up.  They have a huge timing belt (almost 7 feet long)  that runs the cams and water pump that must be retensioned every 15,000 miles and replaces, along with the water pump at 60,000 miles.  928's are known for electrical gremlins that can be a bear to track down and fix.  The fuse panel contains over 65 fuses and 25 or so relays.  

The 928 was available from 1978 to 1995 in various forms,  most are automatics.  this review is of the 1991 928 GT 5spd.  expect to pay in the low to mid 30's for a good one.  ( i got a super good deal on mine)
This is my second Porsche 928 (first one was an '85 928S 5spd) and I have owned them for over four years.  
Things to watch for when buying a 928 are:

1: service records.  (specifically timing belt and water pump) if it does not have ALL of them, take it to a Porsche dealer for a pre-purchase inspection.  it is a must!

2: electrical problems

3: cv shafts and torque tube (drive shaft) listen for any clunking or vibrations.

4:  insurance.  call your carrier and get a quote BEFORE you buy.  these are sports cars and are surcharged as such, especially if you are young.

5: not the best daily driver.  its good to have a back up vehicle and only drive the Porsche on the weekends of when its nice.

On the other hand, there are several companies that specialize in parts and service for 928's and the benefits outweigh the crumby stuff.  just be sure to maintain it properly, the 928 was engineered to go 300,000 miles between engine rebuilds so don't be too scared about milage.  They are holding their values quite well and they don't make these anymore.  And at a fraction of what they cost new with all the same driving excitement, they are a huge bargain in the sports car world, if you can find one.
