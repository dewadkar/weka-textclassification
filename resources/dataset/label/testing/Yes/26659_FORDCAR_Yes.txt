            I just traded in my 95 Escort Wagon, LX.  It had 140,000 Miles and was still going strong.  It was mostly highway mileage.  The only money I had to sink into it was for preventive maintenance and tires, 1 brake job and when i first bought the car new, the fuel pump needed to be replaced, which was under warranty.

Tons of storage space in the back.  Everything worked very well, the Air-Conditioner, the heater the defogger/defroster, heater etc,  I hated to have to get rid of it, but wanted to move to a larger car with more power. I would recommend this car to anyone, especially if you put a lot of miles on a vehicle.

My car had a manual transmission, which I enjoyed very much, and never had any problems with the clutch.  Excellent gas mileage. If you don't mind smaller cars, this is a great way to go.<br><br>
