            Lets get one thing up front, this is not a SUV, its not a family sedan, its not a utilitarian type of vehicle in any way. This car is about fun, this car reminds you of those old days when you put together a go-cart with two by fours and wheels from an old baby stroller, except you don't need the kid with the broken hockey stick pushing you. This car puts a smile on your face everytime you get in and drive it. If you are looking for that type of mount, this car will deliver it in spades. If you believe its "better to drive a slow car fast, than a fast car slow" this car is for you. It always feels like you are ripping up the pavement when in actuality, you are barely over the speed limit. It is not the fastest car on the highways, nor is it the quietest, it is actually kind of slow compared to what else is out there, and the stereo must be turned up to hear it over the rpm's of the engine, but you sit quite comfortably in the seat that seems too small, but when you are in it, it seems to fit quite well, if you are not too much above "average height".  The car is wind and water tight, the shifts are continuous and tossability is tremendous. My car is only a year old, and it has been tight, reliable and economical. The down side would probably be that everything, and I mean everything on the road, including a few of the pedestrians are bigger than you, and  you seem to get tailgated a lot,(I think because you are so small, people tend to look over you, and judge traffic accordingly). If you are interested in what I have just wrote, and you are still reading this, this car is for you.
