                Waking up Christmas morning of 1997 I found a brand new '97 Bravada sitting in the drive way. Now almost four years later I am happy to say I have had no major problems with the SUV.  The only problems I have had are minor problems that happen with the wear and tear of any car (i.e. a knob broke probably an obnoxious younger brother's doing).

     Anyway, the SUV is well made.  The SmartTrek system is surprisingly excellent.  The drive chain varies from year to year but I believe that the 1997's is all wheel drive balanced 60/40.  So when it's raining or roads are icy the automobile automatically switches into all wheel drive and makes for a safer ride.  I recommend putting wider profile tires than the factory ones, it makes for an even safer ride on the road because the tire surface area can grip more road.  The 1997 only has driver air bags, the '98 has passenger as well.

     I haven't had any problems with the engine or anything like that.  Keep up with your tune-ups and your car should last a very long time.  

     The storage capacity when the middle seats are folded is a great amount.  And the luggage rack on the top of the car also adds to the amount that can be hauled around.  The interior is nice with some wood panals.  Leather seats are nice and comfortable.  Long road trips are comfortable especially when the cruise control is set.

     Unfortunatly, GM announced that they are closing Oldsmobile down.  This is very sad because I was planning on buying another Bravada in the future because I believe in their products.
