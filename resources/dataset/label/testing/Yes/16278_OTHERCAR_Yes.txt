            I've now had my 2002 Aerio for 15,000 miles, and can bring to you a review with some experience behind it:

The Pros:
The Aerio is definitely inexpensive compared with other similar cars out there. Standard, the Aerio has Cruise Control, Air Conditioning, Power Windows, Power Mirror Adjustment, In-Dash CD Player, Foglamps and a Trunk Organizer that is just fabulous. I looked at several other similarly priced/featured models, and found them to be underfeatured or overpriced compared to the Aerio every time. I was particularly shocked with the Ford Focus Wagon, which I felt was a terrible value; it rattled and creaked while driving, was underpowered and poorly designed and Ford had few incentives to buy. On the other hand, the Mazda Protege 5 is a wonderful car with good features, but comprably equipped it is much more expensive than the Aerio. I believe the Aerio is a great value.

The Aerio has a lot of room and is a very easy car to live with. The seats are comfortable in front and back, and my Basketball-playing (6-7ft tall) friends have commended it on the ample backseat leg and headroom. The rear seats both fold down for transporting stuff, and can be adjusted back in three positions (from nearly erect to a slightly reclined position) for the comfort of your passengers. The rear seats have a fold-down armrest with a cup-holder, which my passengers like. For storage, the Aerio has a large glove compartment, a drawer under the front passenger seat, shallow door pockets in front, three cupholders in the console (two in front, one in back), magazine pockets on the back of the front seats, a pocket in the very back, and one of my favorite features, a multi-compartment storage area under the rear deck that includes an integrated bucket. You know all that stuff that seems to build up in your trunk? You can store it in here, making for a neater car and keeping it handy at the same time! With the seats folded down for stowing, I have been surprised at what will fit in back. I have fit a 32" TV (in box), a full-size Whirlpool clothes Dryer; not to mention several tables and other stuff. Short of an SUV or Pickup, the Aerio has a lot of space for the price.

The Aerio is an economical car to drive. Powered by a 141 hp, 2.0-liter, inline 4, the Aerio gets about 26 MPG in the city and 33 MPG on the highway. I've found that it's important to keep an eye on the Aerio's tire pressure or these numbers plummet fast. The Aerio comes backed with an excellent warranty as well, and the success of the car ensures plentiful parts for years to come. 

The Aerio is fun to drive. I'd describe the engine as "peppy" in that I (leadfoot) rarely feel like my need for speed is being denied. When needing extra juice for a high-speed merge or pass, a tromp on the gas is all it takes and the Aerio takes off with aplomb. When the A/C is running, the pep is a little more restrained, but not too much. Ride is better than I would expect from a car this economical, but it's not perfect. There is road, tire and engine noise present at all speeds, but not to the point that it is bothersome, in my opinion. If you are looking for a dead-quiet ride, I recommend Mercedes ;^D. The handling is not sports-car quality, either, but predictable and reliably solid. The turning radius is quite tight, making for easy quick parking, u-turns and other maneuvers. Seat comfort is good, I've driven it 10 hours nonstop without causing much soreness or bother. 

The dashboard of the Aerio might take a little getting used to, but it makes sense. The digital readout is a little strange but is completely functional and well-designed. The Heating/AC switches are easy to understand, as is the stereo, windshield wiper and cruise controls. The A/C, when running full blast, is COLD! I strongly suspect an 8-year-old could drive the Aerio, it's that simple. 

The Neutrals:
Much has been said about the Aerio's look. Some say it's ugly. Some say it's wierd. I say it looks just fine for me.

The Cons:
As mentioned above, the Aerio is not the most insular of rides. Bad roads will be felt and heard while driving, just as good roads make for a very pleasant ride. 

Suzuki makes a ~$100 center-console armrest for the Aerio, I believe this should come included as it would increase driving comfort significantly.

A pet peeve of mine is that the A/C always runs when the front defog/defroster is on. While this makes it work very well, I would have preferred to have the choice of running the defog/defrost and A/C together rather than having them linked. 

The rear tray that covers the luggage area is a little flimsy. I no longer use it at all, but this is because when I did, it became clear that taking it out and replacing it often would probably lead to its breaking in the near future.

When I be jammin' to loud music, the door speakers can sometimes vibrate, causing a buzzing noise. Otherwise, the stereo is great, and I've discovered that the buzzing stops if one cracks each window a centimeter or so.

The mesh used on the seats and doors seems to hold soil more than other fabrics. 

But, all in all, after my first 15,000 miles, I can make the following conclusions:
 ~ I love my Aerio
 ~ I drive my Aerio whenever I can (my wife hardly drives anymore!)
 ~ The Aerio is an excellent value.
 ~ The Aerio is versatile - great for moving stuff, road-trips, and passengers.
 ~ The Aerio is FUN!
