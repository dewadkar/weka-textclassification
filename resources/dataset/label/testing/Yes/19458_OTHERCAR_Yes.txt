            We own a 1996 Toyota 4 Runner that was purchased new from the dealer. We have been extremely happy with all aspects of ownership of this SUV. It now has 77,000 miles and is still on the original tires. (Mostly freeway miles).

We have had two major problems with the SUV. The first problem, an engine gasket leak, was noticed as my wife drove to work. The air conditioning shut off and the temperature gauge went to hot. She pulled off the freeway and called the nearest dealer. Since the SUV was under warranty at that time, all repairs were taken care of by the dealer and we were told if there were any future problems with the gasket, they would be taken care of as well.

The second major problem occurred last month. The radiator core developed a leak and it could not be repaired. The SUV was out of warranty and we were looking at over $700 in repairs. We contacted Toyota Corporate and explained the situation. They agreed that the radiator should last longer than 3 years or 77,000 miles and they supplied the $500 radiator to the dealer. We paid around $250 for the labor. 

We are extremely pleased with Toyota's response to these problems and their willingness to stand behind their vehicles.

We have also been extremely happy with this SUV. It has exceeded all our expectations on many fronts.
