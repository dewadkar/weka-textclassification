            White LT Tahoe.

Starting a family of my own, we need a utility vehicle to safely drive around our family.  We also needed a vehicle that can transport items from the local Home Depot or Lowes easily during our "neverending" home improvement projects.

1.  Engine.  Good solid engine, 8 cylinder, 5.3 liter.  Not for drag racing but gets moving when you need to get moving.
Tow & Package kit for towing a boat or pwc (personal water crafts. ie. waverunners)

2.  Ride:  Solid ride.  Very little swaying.  I have driven many suvs.  Must say this has very little sway on turns or lane changes.

3.  Interior:  Leather interior.  Very nice and good quality.  Must see.
3rd row removeable seats.  You can put one or two in.  Lose the storage space but great for day or two day trips for 6-7 people (8 if you have some little people).
Lots of use when seats are out and lower the 2nd row seats.  Used vehicle to transport; 
big 36" tv, long pieces of wood from home depot, firewood for stove (winters worth), barbecue grill, desk, chairs, airhockey table.  Very versatile.

4.  Appearance:  Basic average looking SUV.  Decent styling.  

Friendly advice:
*Do not get sunroof - long term, will start making sounds since it is not made during production.
*The Tahoe and the Cadillac Escalade are built on the same chassis.  The main difference, a few fancy features and softer leather and $10,000 more.  Save yourself the money and get a Tahoe loaded.
