            My wife and I purchased a 2002 Jeep Liberty Sport last June.  We recently drove it on a 4300 round trip from West Texas to Massachusetts and return.  

The Liberty which has the 3.7 V-6, performed flawlessly, and provided a very comfortable ride over even the worst of roads.  We averaged 21 miles per gallon for our entire trip.  I was very satisfied with that.

Without question, the Liberty is a unique vehicle.  We understood from the start that it would not have the characteristics of a car.  It does not ride or handle like a car...it is a Jeep!  With a little practice, even my wife was at ease behind the wheel.

I thought that I would have preconceived notions about Chrysler fit and finish on this vehicle before we went to the dealer.  I was was, however, very impressed with the quality of the build.  Solid and very quiet.

Overall, its a great first SUV for us.  We're so impressed at this point that we may become regular Jeep purchasers in the future.  

A potential buyer should realize and understand before you make the purchase that what you're getting is NOT a car at all, but a traditional Jeep vehicle with all its uniqueness.  With that in mind, you should have no trouble at all making the transition from a regular car.

Regards....
