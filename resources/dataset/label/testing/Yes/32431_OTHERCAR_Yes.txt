            I bought this car to make a daily 40 mile commute.  I wanted a car that got great gas mileage, could be easily parked on the streets of manhattan but when driven felt like a 4 door Acura.  

This car is great for '20-somethings' who want an affordable car and don't yet need those features like double sliding mini van doors to load up the kids and drive to little league.  The car is small enough to fit anywhere and big enough to pile in 5 '20-somethings' for a 1 hour drive without leaving the passengers numb with discomfort.  

The only drawback to this car is road noise - unless you have a super fabulous stereo installed, it is difficult to drown out the sound of the rubber hitting the road.  

People love this car so much that mine was stolen 6 months after I bought it.  I miss it terribly and it makes me even more upset to know just how happy that thief must feel cruising around town in my fab little car.<br><br>
