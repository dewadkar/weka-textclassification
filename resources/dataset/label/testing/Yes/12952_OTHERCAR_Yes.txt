            I drive over 100 miles round trip back and forth to work daily.  I bought this car new in February 1997 because it was a nice alternative to the more expensive imports with a V-6 engine.  Even though I am 6'6&quot;, I can drive comfortably in this vehicle.  

Now the car has over 125,000 miles, and what I consider two minor problems during that time, and the local Chevrolet dealer solved both problems.  I did get an extended warranty on this car, and it came in handy when the alternator went out at 80,000 miles.

Gas usage has been impressive, for a small V-6.  I have averaged between 27 and 30 MPG on the highway.

The only negative point I have on this car is that the steering wheel began to peal badly.  Chevrolet refuses to replace it, even though this started around 30,000 miles.

Overall, this car has performed well for me, and I recommend it.<br><br>
