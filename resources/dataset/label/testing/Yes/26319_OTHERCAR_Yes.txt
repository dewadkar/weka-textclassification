            To be quite honest about this epinion, I don't know much on details about the car like how much it costs, and whatnot.  My parent's purchased one a couple of years ago.  They bought it just after my brother had gotten in an accident and totaled the Toyota Camry.  We decided to purchase a standard shift car, and this one looked good.  As far as how it runs, it's doing pretty well considering I learned how to drive stick shift on it.  The transmission has held up well through my grinding and shaking days.  About the only things that have happened are the antenna has snapped off three times, once in the winter, so that doesn't really count.  Also on the trunk spring shock things, (i don't know the proper term.) the right hand one became unscrewed from the trunk.  Oh well, it has 75,000 miles on it, and it's still putt putting along so it can't be too bad.  Even if my parents don't want it, I'd take it in a heartbeat considering my prize car, is temporarily off the road, so I'm relying on my rollerblades.  All in all, it's a good car for one or two people.  my parents bought it because I was almost in college and my brother already was, so they didn't need another big car.  My dad had one already.  so, if you're a small family or your a person who likes a small car, I'd go for it.  but, I'd go for almost anything now, so maybe you should see an expert.  Who am I to judge.<br><br>
