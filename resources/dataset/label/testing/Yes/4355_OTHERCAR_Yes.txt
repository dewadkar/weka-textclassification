            Let me begin by stating that I love my 1998 Mercury Mystique!  Yes!  some fools do fall in love with their cars!  I actually chose this car after test driving the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.  I also reviewed Consumer reports which actually rated the 1998 Mystique above both of these big sellers.  I have had this car since March 1998 ( bought brand new).  I have had no problems at all!  It has a smooth V-6 which pumps out 170 horses@6250 rpm with 165 lbs of torque.  The suspension absorbs bumps well and the car hardly leans at all when fast cornering.  It is truly a handling enthusiasts car.  It was quoted as being a "poor mans BMW" for thousands of dollars less!  I truly believe it handles in that class.  I purchased the LS with the leather interior with ALL the options, including electronic moonroof. The seats are very comfortable on long trips and there is hardly any road or wind noise ( although not quite as quiet as the Toyota Camry- I admit!)  It is a fun to drive experience as well as a luxury feel when driving cross-country.  The reliability has been AVERAGE for this 1998 model.  My car has been way above average with "0" problems.  However, in the 1st year there were 4 recalls, which were an inconvenience, but were promptly and courteously corrected at the dealership. The sound system sounds good but would benefit with 2 more speakers instead of the current 4 speaker system.  The power windows, seats, AC, cruise control, all have functioned flawlessly in the 3 1/2 years of ownership.  A nice touch is the lighted power window and lock switches usually found in more expensive cars.  I have racked my brain to try to come up with something negative about this car.  I cannot!  I look forward to many more years with my sporty Mystique!

UPDATE: Oct 3, 2003:  Still running FLAWLESSLY after almost 6 years and looks brand new!  Great reliability!
