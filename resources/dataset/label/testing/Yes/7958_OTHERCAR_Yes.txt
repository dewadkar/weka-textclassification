            My 1997 Wrangler is my daily commute vehicle.  It is a manual 5 speed with the straight 6.  This transmission and engine combination has all of the power for the highway, country and off roading one would want to do.  In 4 low, 1st gear you can crawl through the slowest traffic jam or the biggest off road trail.  The trail to Bassy Falls was easier for me than my sisters Four Runner.  The wrangler short wheelbase makes for easy turns and doesn't give you an unbalanced feel.
My family has owned Jeeps since 1978, when I first learned to drive on a CJ5 with the 3 speed V8.  Now that car had power and a easy wash interior, for those mud baths.  My current Wrangler has almost all of the extras, except air conditioning, but that is on my mom's new one.  Jeeps are a family member, as their are currently three, even though seating is comfortable for the front people and neutral at best for the back.
If you don't plan on any trips more than 2 hours than a Jeep Wrangler is the toy, uh vehicle for you.  My longest trip was 4 people 6 hours , but it was fun!!!<br><br>
