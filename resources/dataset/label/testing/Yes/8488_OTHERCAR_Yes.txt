            I purchased this digital camera one year after I had purchased a plain film FujiFilm 35mm. I was recommended to go with FujiFilm from a professional photographer/film processor, as Fuji was well known for their excellent lenses. The pictures off the plain film camera were so superb that when looking for a digital camera I went right to FujiFilm again.  I understand having a larger mega pixel is nice but if the lens is poor, poor pictures are to follow.  

I use the camera for point-and-shoot home and business use and the majority of the pictures are either saved to Zip disc or cropped/shrunk for email/web pages. For these uses the camera gives you more than you would ever need. I don't print onto paper so I have no comments on print quality, but if image quality on-screen is any indication, I don't see any disappointments.

The software was easy to install and when the USB cable is connected, the transfer of pictures is automatic; a no brainer. 

Without spending too much time in the operation manual, using the camera was very similar to using any menu driven electronic device - very straightforward. 

I promptly shot 48 photographs with the camera after a short battery recharge and I purposely tried to break all the rules in photography: shoot into bright windows, dark shadows, too close, shaking, etc.  To my surprise almost every shot came through with flying colors. The Macro function (close-up) was my favorite. The manual reads that 10mm is as close as it will go so I went 8mm and the pictures were awesome, crystal clear, and great color. Impressed!  This is a very forgiving camera.  The camera comes with a 16MB card and I shoot only about 3 by 5's with it so it will store over 100 photos on the 300kb setting, wow!

What I didn't like: I have large hands and this camera's chassis is quite petite so getting a hold of it is sometimes difficult. I will probably need to purchase an additional set of Ni-MH batteries as the flash really taxes the rechargables.  AND, my biggest beef, I just spent $500 CDN on this camera and it did not come with a 50-cent nylon case! Shame on them.

Overall, I look forward to many years of inexpensive photography.
