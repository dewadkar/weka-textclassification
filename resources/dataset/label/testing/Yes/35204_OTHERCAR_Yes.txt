            After seeing the Toyota 4Runner for the first time I knew I had to test drive it.  It has received impeccable reviews including a &quot;recommended&quot;-its highest ranking- by Consumer Reports.  I immediately fell in love with this great looking car.  The 4Runner is one of the best SUV's on the market right now for several reasons.  For an SUV it corners very well and gets good mileage and acceleration with its 3.4 liter, 183 horse power V6 engine, which is the way to go with SR5 additions.  The new models come with four wheel drive option which I recommend.  The interior is very roomy and comfortable, with plenty of leg room in the back seats.  After owning one 4Runner for 10 years I have not had one single maintenance problem, which is why our family recently bought a brand new 4Runner.  This vehicle is often compared with the Ford Explorer, which I have also driven, but the 4Runner is far and away a better car.  The 4Runner has better crash test records and a much better repair history, not to mention the fact that it just plain drives better.  I have not encountered one single problem ever with either of my 4Runners, unless of course you consider being bombarded with complements a problem, which is why I recommend it to all.  For anyone who is considering buying an SUV, this is the one to go after.<br><br>
