            I purchased a new 1997 Mercury Mountaineer in September 1996.  I was on the way to a Chevy dealership to purchase a Tahoe when I spotted what looked like an entirely new Explorer on a car carrier.  I followed it to a Mercury dealership and upon closer examination realized that this was a new vehicle to the Mercury line.  It was fully loaded with leather and a sunroof and looked stunning in the firemist red metallic with dark grey lower paint treatment.  The window sticker was not yet affixed and I did not know how much it cost, but I knew I had to have the vehicle.

After several hours of negotiations (hard sell), I took immediate delivery of my Mountaineer and the salesman followed me home in my 1995 Audi 90S (which was not cost effective to trade at the time).  It was powerful with the 5.0L and was extremely comfortable.  I did not even realize which I purchased it just how many features the Mountaineer had and how useful they were including rear seat climate and radio controls and the overhead compass and thermometer.  

The Mountaineer was an impressive vehicle and always drew compliments.  I currently own a 1999 Lexus that does not attract close to the attention that the Mountaineer did.  People always came up to me a remarked what a beautiful vehicle it was.  The fit and finish was impressive for a sport utility vehicle.

I drove the Mountaineer for 60,000 miles in two and a half years with only one visit to the repair shop.  It had a squeak in the engine compartment which was determined to be a loose battery box.  

Although my Mountaineer had all wheel drive (AWD), this is not a vehicle that should be considered to be an off road vehicle.  The AWD system is designed primarily for normal street use.  The ground clearance is very low and the AWD system is not like that of a true 4X4.  You cannot lock the differentials giving you this capability.  I tried to go off road once and got horribly stuck in a relatively small ditch.  Two wheels were off the road and the other two were firmly planted on the ground.  The two that were off the ground continued to spin which was not much help!  I had to have it towed out of a situation that would not have occured in a true 4X4 vehicle.  However, the Mountaineer is very sure footed on all street conditions including dry, snow covered and wet conditions.  The braking is adequate for a vehicle of this size and weight.

I was always impressed with the towing capacity of the Mountaineer.  I could almost forget at times that I had my 21 foot powerboat rolling along behind me.  I also towed my 1999 Lexus on a full car carrier (a 5,500 pound load) for over 200 miles with no problems at all.

The gas mileage was relatively poor with an average of 14 miles per gallon achieved throughout my 60,000 miles of ownership of the Mountaineer.  Also, I feel that the gas tank was too small (21 gallons) for a vehicle that achieved only 14 miles to the gallon.  A long trip was always interrupted with several stops at a gas station.  One must weigh the benefits of the V8 against the poor fuel economy.

Overall, the Mountaineer proved to be a comfortable and reliable vehicle.  It is an extremely flexible vehicle and would suit many purposes.  It is easy to park in even New York City parking garages.  It is at home in formal situations and at the hardware store.  

I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for the comforts of a luxury automobile with the flexibility of a truck.<br><br>
