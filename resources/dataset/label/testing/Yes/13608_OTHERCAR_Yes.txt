            I have always wanted a S-10 ZR2 extended cab for a few years. I finally decided to get one before I got to old.  I am 30 and it seems that I am the oldest person who owns one of these where I am from.  What attracted me the most was the impressive statement it made.  It says strong and durable with a little bit of sex appeal.  I opted for the LS version with the third door.  The controls are easy to use,  The cd sounds great, and so does the cassette player.  It works great on snow and ice and I really like the shift on the go 4wd. The V6 engine has power but it could use a V8 considering its weight.  It has a nice ride for trips under 4 hours. The really only complaint that I have is the MPG.  The best that I have been able to get is 17 MPG with an average of 11 to 15 MPG on the road and 5 to 8 MPG in town.   With gas being very high you should consider this a major factor when deciding to purchase this vehicle. Of course if gas prices mean nothing to you I think that you should buy this truck for its looks and the bang you get for your buck.  It is a truck for those who like something different than what other people have.  I would not recommend this truck to senior citizens and other people who would have a tough time crawling into the cab.<br><br>
