            I purchased my 1994 Mitsubishi (MB) 3000GT SL 5 speed coupe in late 2002 after my beloved 1992 Nissan 240sx was destroyed due to a driver running a stop sign and smashing my car up.  I was car shopping for a good 4 months before I found what I was looking for.  The dealer I purchased this car from had a 1996 240sx that I went with the intention to buy; but that car was in poor shape.  The MB really caught my eye.  The price was slightly more than what I wanted to pay, but this car was in a class much above the 240.  

This particular model year was the first in which MB did away with pop up headlights and went to projector beams.  In fact, 1994 was the only year glass was used to cover the head light assemblies.  From 95 to 99, Lexan was used and I�&#128&#153ve heard owners say that it tends to dull out if exposed to sunlight for a few years.  Good old glass will not do that.  

In any case, the car has wonderful styling that is evolutionary and not revolutionary.  Much of the original 3000GT design is there, but just refreshed.  For those of you unfamiliar with these cars they were developed by Chrysler Corporation and MB in a joint venture to bring out an affordable car for people who wanted style combined with everyday drivability.  Dodge made the Stealth and MB the 3000GT.  Both cars are VERY SIMILAR mechanically speaking.  I guess that is a good thing if you are on a road trip and have problems.  A dodge dealer should be able to service a 3000GT in case of an emergency and vice versa with Stealth at an MB dealer.  

If you look closely at the body you can see the Dodge Viper influence that went into this.  The body is ultra wide at the corners but tapers in the center by the doors.  Also, the door mounted, as opposed to A-pillar mounted, outside rear view mirrors look like a direct Viper styling cue.  That�&#128&#153s where the Viper influence ends.  The car came in FWD for base and SL models while VR4�&#128&#153s got all time four wheel drive and four wheel steering.  

That VR4 sounds pretty cool doesn�&#128&#153t it?  I agree, but unless you are a mechanic or pretty wealthy I advise you to stay away from the VR4.  The cost of insurance and up keep will eat you alive.  The 3-liter V6 that powered that car had twin turbos that made 320 horsepower.  The first generation VR4s had 300 ponies but power was increased in 94 to match the power that Toyota Supra turbo offered when it made its premier that year.  It has been my experience that turbo charged cars are best to own only under a comprehensive full coverage dealer warranty.  If a turbo goes bad on you I would say you are looking at perhaps over 2 grand just in parts for repairs.  Besides just the turbo, the VR4s have 2 differentials to worry about, a complicated automatic a/c system, 4 drive half shafts, and a slew of other things that can cost big bucks that I would rather not know about.  

If you are like me and want a nice looking car that is easy to maintain, I suggest you get an SL model.  These cars have everything the VR4s did except the turbo engine, the auto climate control, the fancy drive and steer system, and the big repair bills.  Sadly, my car has the ECS (electronic controlled suspension) like the VR4.  ECS is just a fancy way of saying you can make your suspension firm or soft with the touch of a button on the dash.  The idea is to have a soft suspension for touring the streets and being comfortable while making the car go �&#128&#156sport�&#128&#157 (firm) for performance driving or racing.  The entire idea is pretty stupid for the SL model because it�&#128&#153s by no means a car to race.  The curb weight is pretty high at over 3300 pounds.  

Anyway, the ECS system will eventually fail and default to firm and make the ride bone jarring.  I suppose they did this to force you into repairs.  There is no aftermarket ECS strut made. New ones from MB cost $253 each.  However, you can buy aftermarket adjustable struts made by names like KONI or TIEN and eliminate the ECS system completely.  My suspension acts up once a month or so by defaulting to firm.  If it ever gets stuck in firm I will go aftermarket for sure.  Other than that the SL trim is pure VR4 luxury.  The seats are covered in leather, the driver gets a power seat, everything is power operated, the outside rearview mirrors are heated, and you get the premium infinity sound system.  Of course there are the features most cars have like cruise, tilt wheel, etc.  

The engine that powers this machine is also a 3-liter V6 that is very similar to the turbo, but in this form makes 222 horsepower.  The power is more than enough for daily driving and enough to pass most stuff on the freeway in top gear without downshifting.  Speaking of the transmission it is a 5 speed Getrag that can be described as being notchy.  The first two gears require a little muscle to throw so smaller drivers should beware.  There is an auto 4 speed available with the base and SL models.  All VR4s got Getrag 6 speeds.  My car does about 2500 rpm at 65 mph.  This was a bit disappointing.  I have owned in line 4 cylinder Toyotas that did 60 mph at 2500 rpm.  Being that this was a larger engine and made sufficient amounts of torque at lower rmps it should have cruised at 70 around 2000 rpm.  Had MD thrown in the 6 speed on SL models this might have been accomplished.  As is the fuel economy is about 22 mpg but with that 6 speed a number closer to 30 could have been reached.  

The interior of the car is stellar!  One thing to be noted is how close the windshield comes to your face if you are a taller driver.  I�&#128&#153m 5�&#128&#15311�&#128&#157 and it took a little getting used to.  In any case, I love the dash on the car.  The main cluster has the speedo, tach, and fuel gauges while oil pressure, water temp, and voltage gauges are housed in the center stack that is a direct take off from the original Nissan Z car design.  A few nice touches in the car are audio controls in the steering wheel, a consol that allows you to totally rest your arm and shift at the same time, and just how all gauges and controls point at the driver.  

A few problem areas on the interior include the horn buttons in the steering wheel that are known to pop out, the windshield defroster vents that crack, the glove box latch that breaks, the shifter boot that cracks and peels, and the power windows that malfunction (freeze up).  The leather on the seats, steering wheel, and shift knob is top grade and very durable; mine still looks new.  The rear seat is useless even if you have small children.  They do have a spit fold feature that is useful.  However, they do not have a key lock to fix them in the upper position to protect valuables in the trunk.  The seat belts are also very alloying in the car because they do not retract when the door is opened.  They just hang there with slack and you have to be careful to not slam the door shut on them.

The HVAC controls are all large and easy to use rotary switches.  The a/c button has an economy mode where the compressor cycles on and off to save fuel and a max power position to give heavy cooling.  The system is an R143a so repairs are more affordable.  To me the car feels like a meat locker just in the economy a/c mode.  MD also did a great thing by making the fresh/recirculated air selector a slide control instead of a push button.  That switch in push button style jammed up on every Toyota I have ever owned; no problems here though.  

The infinity stereo system is great.  It�&#128&#153s an 18 preset, tape, and 6-disc setup with an amp under the passenger seat.  I�&#128&#153m not sure of the wattage, but it delivers super powerful low frequencies.  It sounds and feels as if you have a factory subwoofer.  The setup consists of 4 midrange speakers in the car with 2 tweeters on the top of the dash.  I�&#128&#153ve read about these tweeters rotting out because of sunlight exposure.  Mine are okay, but the placement is still flawed IMHO.  It�&#128&#153s a pretty smart radio is all I can say.  Controls are intuitive and it even has this neat feature of not deploying the power antenna if you start out by listening to a tape or cd.  

Moving to the rear, the trunk is pretty tiny for such a big car.  I suppose the 20-gallon fuel tank that sits below is responsible for the sacrificed trunk room.  The 6-disc changer sits right behind the rear seats in the trunk.  The owners manual suggests you lower the rear seat to get to the changer, but I find it better to just reach from the trunk.  This may be hard to do if you are short.  MD wrapped the changer in an insulated fabric case that helps to keep it clean and protected.  The central location also prevents skipping.  Under the floor of the trunk is a compact spare tire with the jack and tools built into these trick panels in the wall of the trunk.  There are also two plastic bins in the tire area that can be used to store stuff that would stain your carpets.

Overall I would recommend a 3000GT, but not the VR4 models unless you are a hard-core enthusiast.  Parts are expensive on all models and so is service.  The engine is an interference type meaning that if the timing belt breaks, the pistons bend the valves and you get a repair bill for thousands of dollars.  New timing belts every 60K miles are a must.  This service usually runs about $800.  Tune-ups also cost big bucks on this engine because the plenum has to be removed to get to the rear spark plugs.  The tune up parts are also high dollar items; case in point each spark plug retails for $12.  The whole service will set you back around $400 and is required every 60K miles.  The plugs last 60K miles but things like the coolant, the belts, and air filter are best replaced every 30K miles in a minor tune up that you can do yourself.  The tire size on my SL is 225/55/16 which means that tires can range from $120 to $300 each.  Keep that in mind when you are shopping.  VR4s have 17-inch wheels that require even more expensive rubber.  Another very important thing to look for on this engine is to see if it smokes at all under any driving conditions.  After 100K miles, this engine is notorious for getting valve seals worn out and producing blue smoke at the exhaust pipe.  A valve seal job runs about $600 and cannot be avoided once the mileage gets up there. Whatever you do never buy a 3000GT that is in bad shape in hopes of fixing it up.  By the time you bring it up to good condition,  you will have spent more than what it would have cost you to buy a turn the key and go 3000GT.    

This car may become collectable someday since they stopped making them and they were a rather limited production vehicle.  VR4s are ultra rare while SLs are something you don�&#128&#153t see everyday.  I think they made just over 5500 in 1994.  If you get a chance to buy one in good shape, I say go for it.  I forgot to mention it but the car has dual airbags, ABS, and a rear window wiper for safety.
