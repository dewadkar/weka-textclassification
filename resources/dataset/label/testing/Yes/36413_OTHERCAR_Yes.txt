            We bought this vehicle because we have three children and are constantly driving carpools, etc. The extra space really comes in handy on road trips, too. We bought it because the van looks elegant and is definitely luxurious on the inside. I love the extra space, luxurious look and rich feel of the van. The extra little things are nice too, for example, the seat warmers are a real treat in cold winters. I can't say I hate anything about this van, it's great! Although it would be nice if the seats were a little lighter and easier to remove. This van drives like a dream. It's so smooth and definitely easier to steer than other vans. It feels like driving a car. I still can't get over how smooth and stable the ride feels. I would recommend this car to anyone, it's great. We had a minivan before that lasted over 11 years. I'm sure this one will be just as durable. If you like extra space, nice options, and want a great car, then this is the one!!<br><br>
