            Notice the title says &quot;Sporty&quot;, not &quot;Sports car&quot;. There's nothing wrong with being sporty--that's why I bought one--but keep in mind this car is not going to outgun a Corvette at a stoplight.

It's also very comfortable &amp; quiet, things you wouldn't normally say about a sports car.

But like a sports car, it handles very well. Going around on-ramps is a joyride!

Friends &amp; family are shocked at how such a small car can be so solid &amp; refined.

I researched this category for over a year. I used to drive Japanese cars exclusively. My previous car was a Mazda Millennia S. That was a great car, too. But it was a little too large for what I wanted, and I hated the fact that it didn't have a manual transmission. In fact, that's the problem with all the Japanese cars in this class--they only come with automatics. I love the control of a manual transmission, and knowing that my 1.8T with a manual accelerates as fast as a 2.8 with an automatic.

I bought mine through carorder.com, when they were having a special deal. They ended up paying the local dealer to give me the price they quoted me. Here in Minnesota, both Audi dealers are owned by the same company and they are very popular because of the quattro all-wheel-drive, so you're lucky if you get $1000 off list price. I saved $1700 over what the local dealers were offering.

I'm envious that the 2001 models of the 1.8T now have 170 horsepower (my 2000 model has 150 horsepower). Audis are not well known for low-end torque--they are highway cars, not stoplight cars. But then I don't expect many 18-to-22 year olds to buy Audis and use them on a drag strip.

If you want a zoom-fast sports car, the A4 1.8T is not for you. In that case, try an S4 (dual turbocharged engine), a Porsche, or a BMW.

If you want a comfortable, composed, refined, quiet, extremely capable car that handles exceptionally well, the A4 is your perfect vehicle.<br><br>
