            I bought this vehicle because I had a baby and out truck wasn't big enough for everything.  The jeep is more spacious and it get better gas milelage.  I love the way my jeep runs.  It runs very smoothly.  There is quite enought &quot;trunk&quot; space for when I go on trips and stuff like that.  The only thing that I don't like about the jeep is that the back seat isn't for adults.  It is very cramped.  When my husband is driving we have to move  the car seat because my daughter's feet touch the back of the seat.  The jeep drives very smooth.  single people and small families are great for this car<br><br>
