            Our <i>newest</i> car is a <b>1991 Camry.</b>  Husband and I are looking for a vehicle that will provide a comfortable ride in our &quot;old age&quot;.  To this end, we are taking every opportunity to rent cars that we are considering buying and giving them the &quot;Tourist from Heck&quot; treatment.  You can get more real data from a few days of renting, than you can from a 15 minute test drive on city streets.

Our latest experiment was with a <b>2000 Cadillac DeVille</b>, rented for 4 days while visiting the Desert Southwest part of this country.  This area of the country is known for it's very high heat, (109 degrees while we were there, but would cool off to 92 degrees at night) Lighting and wind storms, as well as mountainous terrain.  Oh yeah, and a lot of rich &amp; wannabe rich people who drive really nice cars up &amp; down <b><i>The Strip</b></i>.

I left the <b>Avis</b> car rental agency with a <b>2000 Cadillac DeVille</b> that had less than 10,000 miles.  This classy car was maroon in color with tan leather seats. 

<b>Features I Loved</b>

<i>Room.</i>  Not once did hubby and I bump elbows while sitting in this large car.

<i>Trunk Space.</i> On the way back to the airport, we took 3 more family members and their luggage, as well as our own.  This included 5 suitcases, 3 back packs, 1 full set of golf clubs, 1 garment bag, and 3 purses. 

<i>Rearview Mirror.</i>  The mirror has a COMPASS in it!  For those of you who know me, know that I can be facing a sunset and get lost.  The police in Alabama use to take turns getting me turned around whenever I had to go out there for work.  The compass was too cool, and actually useful.  The Rearview mirror also had a feature where it would dim or darken when car lights were behind you.  No more having to flip the mirror to the 'evening night' position.  When the annoying headlights were no longer shining in your eyes, the mirror went back to it's normal setting.

<i>Separate climate controls.</i>  This is a really useful feature in the desert.  The sun is beating on one side but not the other.  You had to have the same fan speed on all 3 zones (yes, there was even one for the back seat) but each of the zones could adjust how cold or warm their vent air was.  Even when the outside temperature was 109 degrees (there is a readout on the front panel that tells you the outside temperature -and it always matched those on the Bank towers) the inside of the car was very comfortable.  Within seconds of our entering the car, the climate controls would have the car comfortable.

<i>Surround Sound Stereo.</i>  Oh!  This was nice!  It was just like being at home surrounded by speakers from every direction.  You could lose yourself in some great music.  This feature was controlled by my most favorite feature:

<i>The Steering Wheel.</i> Someone got smart and put a whole bunch of controls right at your 'thumb tip'!  With your left thumb (without taking your hands off the steering wheel, nor your eyes off the road) you can control how fast the temperature on your side of the car.  You could adjust cooling and fan speed.  Also, lower down, you could set your cruise control.  The cruise control had accelerate &amp; deaccelerate features, as well as pause and resume.  With your right thumb, you could switch radio stations (search/scan) and also adjust the volume.  We used these features often (yes, I let hubby drive the car too!)

<b>Features I Liked</b>

<i>Glove box</i>.  I liked the roomy glove box with a shelf and a small inner compartment.  In the glove box is also a Valet Lock.  From here you can lock the trunk and gas tank so that someone with your car key can not have access to these areas.  Unless they knew about the:

<i>Folding back seats.</i>  The back seats fold down so that you can load more stuff in your trunk.  I can imagine myself returning from a lumber yard in my Cadillac with a car full of building supplies for remodeling.
Behind the back seat's center arm rest there is a 8&quot; panel to reach through to the trunk.

<i>Back and Front Seat Armrests.</i> These armrests that are between the 4 main seats fold down from their normally upright position.  They have compartments to hold cameras, wallets, change.  But they also have hidden cup holders.  Just fold out the cup holder when you need it, or have it hidden.  If you have 5 people in the car, the back seat armrest/cup holder can not be used.

<i>Information Panel.</i>   This panel that is on the dashboard in front of the driver, lets the driver know:
How much gas per mile is consumed -and how many more miles one can go at that rate.
Average trip Miles Per Hour
Battery Life
Transmission Fluid Level
Current Speed (in large, easy to read numbers)
Recommendations (&quot;Headlights Suggested&quot; came on in underground parking garages)
and a Timer.  Hubby liked this feature when stuck at a red light.  It kept him occupied.

<i>V8 Engine.</i>  Give this car a 'little gas' and it goes.  Step on the gas pedal, and this puppy <i>GOES</i>!  Climbing a mountain road and you have an opportunity to pass that 18-wheeler?  It doesn't take any effort to get around the slow moving vehicles.  In a town where they serve lots of free drinks to gamblers, we had no problems getting away from questionable drivers.  The only real downside to this is when we went to Hoover Dam.  Most of that area is 15 to 25 MPH.  This car DOES NOT want to go that slow!  Each of us spent a lot of time using the brakes in these situations.  We never did (Thankfully) get to try out the ABS break system.

<i>Power Everything.</i>  I loved the windows, AM/FM/CD stereo, automatic seat adjustments (up, down, forward, backward, &amp; tilt), and the automatic seatbelt adjustments.  This last feature was great.  Normally (because I'm vertically challenged) seatbelts like to rest across my chin.  With the touch of a button, I could raise or lower the seatbelt 6&quot; to fit me.  Which I had to do after I gave my 6 foot-something brother a ride in the car!

<b>Features I didn't Prefer</b>

<i>Leather Seats.</i> These were very nice and soft seats.  But in the desert areas people wear shorts.  With shorts and leather seats, one of 2 things happened (if not both).  First my legs stuck to the seats.  45 minutes in the car, and it was like I was 'Waxing' the backs of my thighs.  Second, if the car had been parked in the sun, the seat would get so hot that the few hairs left on my thighs got burnt off.
 
<i>Gas Mileage.</i> This car got 15.5 MPG on average.  This is good for this size car, but not the 35 MPG that we are used to.

<b>The Ride</b>

Ok, all these whistles and bells are great, but How Was The Ride?
It was NICE!  So smooth.  Whether we were in a construction zone, mountain road, thunder storm or wind storm, the ride was very smooth.  The steering liked to pull to one side, but that may have been from abuse as a rental car.  Our '91 <b>Camry</b> will continue to go straight when your hands are off the wheel, while this car tried to turn left if you took your hands off.  Our <b>Camry</b> is a 4-cylinder car, a lot less powerful than this <b>2000 Cadillac DeVille</b>.  

It took no time at all for either hubby nor I to get used to driving this dream machine.  The hardest part was turning it back in and going back to our old car -for now.  We put this car on our 'Short List' of prospects for our next car.  Of course, we would try to get cloth seats instead of leather.

We're still looking at all cars, but the <b>2000 Cadillac DeVille</b> is at the top of the list!<br><br>
