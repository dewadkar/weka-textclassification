            When you think of 2 megapixel cameras, you think big expensive and hard to use.  This is the absolute opposite.  This is the best camera you can possibly buy for under $250.  It's better than most other digitals (quality -wise) with the same features.

The Good

This thing has so many filter and features, you won't know what to do with.  Pictures are basically point and click under normal lighting conditions.  I would recommend not using the LCD screen for pictures because it drains the battery about 2X faster.  However, you do have to get used to using the viewfinder - objects appear closer than they really are.  It comes with an 8mb smartmedia card which I recommend replacing immediately with something beefier (I got a 128MB smartmedia card for $66) if you intend to shoot high quality pics like me.  I use this camera for pics of my new baby and other family type photos which I print out on my Epson 1270 - you can't tell the difference between a real photograph and the print out.  

I've heard smartmedia is a little slower than the other types of storage media out there.  This may be true, but in my opinion the cost to performance ratio is to high for other types of media.  The time between pictures is slightly long but it can be tolerated considering you only paid $200 for a typically $350+ camera.  The only time you run into a highly noticeable delay is when using the max 2megapixel mode (there are 3 levels of 2mb fine, medium, low).

Downloads are quick and easy using the USB interface and are already in jpg format for you ready for printing or web display.

The Bad

The only really painful thing about this camera that I would immediately change would be to add an optical zoom.  Pictures seem really far away even when taken from a few feet (easily corrected in Adobe Photoshop though).  My wife and I have also notice that the pictures seem a little skewed in horizontal direction - people seem a little elongated.  This is probably due to the cheap lens on it.  

Recommendations

I would definitely get this camera if you want a true performer without draining the bank account.  Prints made to 4X6 seem EXACTLY like the real thing (with a good photo printer like the Epson 1270 of course) and 8X10's are very decent as well but would benefit from a 3 megapixel more.

The only additions to this camera is to buy a higher capacity smartmedia card and to buy rechargeable NiMH AA batteries for it.
