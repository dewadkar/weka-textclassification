            Nothing you can say would make me believe there is a better camera out there than this. I've been selling items on Ebay for over a year now and this Polaroid Photo Max PDC-640 is AMAZING. I love it. The pictures are clear, sharp, it's a VERY affordable camera. You might be thinking, if you have to spend $150(which is what I paid for the camera) it's not worth it. BUT that's where you're wrong. I think you're profits will go up 15%-25% percent because the quality of the pictures are SO good. My auctions have gone up from say $50.00 to $69.21, that's over a 38% percent increase. It's cheap, affordable, will help your profits, and looks really cool too! Get one today!<br><br>
