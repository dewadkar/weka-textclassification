            The Ford Windstar is a great minivan for those families out there that are always on the run.  I love it.  It actually drives like a car even though it is pretty large.  It has a nice look and is comfortable.  I have had this van for four years and it is still holding up.  I recommend this to anyone who wants a minivan that drives great and is worth the price.  I bought it for $25,000 and it is great. I have had no problems with this car and recommend it. Take it from me, the Ford Windstar is a great van and worth the price.
