            We bought this vehicle because our Honda Accord was on its last legs after 13 years of great service.  At the time, the Camry was getting excellent reviews.

I was and am still (7 years later) amazed at the quality of this car.  For the first year or so after we bought it, I would notice a different design feature every month or so and say, &quot;Wow! Now that's a good idea!&quot;  We have put 183,000 km (114,000 miles) on the odometer and have had zero (count 'em, zero!) non-trivial problems with the car.  The only maintenance involved routine oil changes, tire replacements, and the rubber boots on the axels had to be replaced once.  The brakes had to be done twice in the 7 years we've had the car.

With every other car I've owned in the past, including the Honda (which was the 2nd best car I've owned) I eventually got to the point where I noticed the odd niggling irritating thing that made me wonder what the designers were thinking when they made that choice.  This has not happened with the Camry so far.  It is almost as if Toyota got a vast focus group together to hash out what each of them wanted in their dream car and designed everything that more than one person wanted into the Camry.

The car handles as flawlessly today as it did when I drove it off the lot as a new car in 1993.  It starts in milliseconds even when it has been sitting overnight in -5 degree F temperatures.  It accelerates smoothly and brakes evenly.  The adjustable steering is solid and comfortable.  There is plenty of leg room front and rear.  The acceleration is adequate (I've got the 4 cyl model).  Gas consumption is as advertised -- reasonable for a car of its size.  The controls are conveniently located and intuitive.  The seats are very comfortable and easy to adjust.  They show no noticeable deterioration.  The trunk easily accommodates our 4 pieces of luggage for multi-week holiday trips or trips to the airport. 

So far, the only flaws I've found are 1) the locking tab on the gas portal door broke off once and 2) The hubcaps fell off (or were stolen).  

This is the first car I've owned that completely lives up to the hype in its advertising brochures.  None of it is exaggerated.

Anyone looking for a family sedan would be hard pressed to find a better choice.
