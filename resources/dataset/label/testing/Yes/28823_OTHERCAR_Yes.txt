            We got the Kodak dc210 for Christmas last year and we love it! I'm the type of person to shoot a roll of film in no time, then when you get them developed you're lucky to get 2 or 3 decent pictures. What a waste of money!

With the digital you can take all the pictures you want, delete what didn't come out good, and take more! Download into the computer, view on the monitor, send e-mail to gramma in VT, post a photo album on the internet so everyone can see them, send off to one of several companies to make prints and send them back to you, at a very low cost! Personally, I am a very low-tech person, but this camera is easy to use, and fun! 

The only down side is BATTERIES! But we use rechargeable, so it's not too bad. If you like to take lots of photos that don't usually turn out great, this camera will be well worth the money!<br><br>
