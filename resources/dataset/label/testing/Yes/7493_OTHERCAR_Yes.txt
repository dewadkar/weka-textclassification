            We bought our 2000 Dodge Stratus in the summer of 2003.  With 77,000 miles on it from it's use as a military recruiter's car, it wasn't in bad shape at all considering it's past.  From a manufacturing quality standpoint, there has been nothing wrong with it in the ten-thousand miles since I bought it.

It's a four door, with power windows, locks, seats, AM/FM cassette, cruise control, air-conditioning, and a four-cylinder engine.  The back seat is spacious enough for my wife or I to sit comfortably on either side of our son's infant car seat (strapped in the center), our smaller Civic won't let us do that without squeezing in before shutting the door. 

The driver's seat is spacious enough for my 6' tall, 250 lb frame, and with the seats and suspension on the Stratus, it's a comfortable ride.  In fact, my 6' 7" father in-law was only slightly tight on space in the front passenger seat on one of our latest trips across town.  The trunk can hold the baby's stroller, as well as a pack-n-play, several midsized overnight bags, and various diaper bags.  (I used to measure trunk space by the number of guitars and amps I could fit...but that was another era...)   See my review for my <a href="/inst-review-40F1-260BC1A3-3A1ECAD7-prod5">Fender Strat</a> for guitar info.

Our other car is a 2000 Honda Civic (see the <a href="/auto-review-62D4-16899562-3A12DB53-prod2">review</a>) and now seems to pale in comparison to the Stratus.

One of the reasons we bought the Civic was for its resale value.  The Stratus doesn't have very good resale value.  But that doesn't matter to us because we don't trade in cars every few years.  We drive them until they die. (See review for<a href="/auto-review-7F3E-168B3D38-3A12DF90-prod2"> our first civic</a>)  Just to illustrate the difference in resale values, consider that both our cars are 2000 models.  The Honda Civic retailed for $14,500, and the Dodge Stratus for $15,900.  The book value on the Civic today is around $9,600 and the price I bought the Stratus for was $4500.  

Because I bought the car with 77,000 'military recruiter' miles on it, I've been pleased that the only maintenance (other than oil change) has been the brakes.  The guys at the shop said that Stratus brakes generally require rotor replacement if the brakes aren't replaced when needed, unlike other models where rotors can be reground for a smaller fee, and then used further.  When I replaced my brakes (I procrastinated for about 4000 miles), I needed to get one rotor replaced, and had one other one ground.  The total bill was around $300 for brakes, one new rotor, and one ground rotor.

Other than that, the Stratus has been a good commuter car.  I travel 30-40 miles twice a day on the interstate, and get around 30 miles per gallon and have been using 10% ethanol blended fuel in all of our cars without a problem.  It rides smooth, steers smooth.  Cruise control works reliably and is super easy to set and adjust.  Dashboard is easy to read.  Climate control is simple to use.  Cassette desk took me a little getting used to as it was somewhat confusing, but now I'm a pro (without a manual).  Storage space in doors, dashboard console, and parking break console is generous.  Great for holding cassettes, CDs, or 5x8 or smaller books.

It frequently crosses our mind to get rid of our Civic and buy a second Stratus.  The only thing that stops us from doing that is the hail damage our Civic sustained would reduce our Civic trade value, otherwise, we'd be glad to sell a $9600 car, but another $4500 Stratus, and pocket the $5100 difference.

I could buy a lot of guitars and amps with $5100.
