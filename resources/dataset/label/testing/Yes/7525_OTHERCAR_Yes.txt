            When I was first going out to buy a car I didn't really think about buying a Dodge Stratus, I was actually looking for a Honda. But when I went to the car dealer and started looking at the cars I saw that the Stratus not only looked like a luxury car but also like a sporty car for the low price. The 4 cylinder 2.4 liter Mitsubishi made engine looked powerful and drove like it had some power.I can actually keep up with all those Honda's and Nissan's. It make a little noise, but it's worth it. It very roomy especially in the back. Since I bought this car in 99 I haven't had any problems with it. Any one who likes luxury and also the sporty look for the fraction of the price of other cars,should consider buying this car, and also in 2001 this car is going to come in a 2 door R/T sport mode.<br><br>
