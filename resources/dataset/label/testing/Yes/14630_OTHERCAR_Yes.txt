            We have now owned the vehicle for almost a year and a half and still love it.  It has seating capacity for 9 (8 if you get the buckets), almost a 2500-pound payload and the ability to tow up to 12000 pounds (ours is 10100 lbs max), which works perfectly for us.  It is also driven by my wife as "Mom's Taxi", daily.  She loves the way it drives and handles.  It turns in a shorter area than its only real competitor, the Ford Excursion, plus carry a larger payload by around half-a-ton.  It rides very quietly.  It has sprightly acceleration.  It handles extremely well and rides smooth; much better than it's competition.
We also tow a 25' travel trailer with it that puts the total weight of Yukon XL and trailer at around 14000 pounds.  It is able to maintain the highway speeds, even at higher elevations where there is less oxygen for the engine to use.  It does quite respectable pulling up the mountain passes also - it will hold 20 mph faster up the passes than the old small block vehicle we had.
The only more major issue we have ever had with it was the electronic crankshaft sensor went bad and shut down the engine (to avoid damage to the engine.)  It was replaced promptly under warranty and we haven't had a similar problem since.  The other problems it has been in for is one of the plastic shoulder belt kids clips broke, the dash had a small squeak, and we had a bad serpentine belt that was noisy (no problem since that was replaced.)
Overall it is a very nice vehicle and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again.  If it wasn't for the Excursion (which is being discontinued due to slow sales) having a diesel engine available and slightly more interior room (although not as comfortable at all), the Yukon XL would have everything anyone in this market could want.
