            I needed a digital camera because my proposal to take digital pictures of pizza had been accepted with a due date of the next day. Of course, I didn�t actually have time to buy the camera until the day I needed to take the pictures.

I looked for cameras at several places, including Circuit City, Office Max, and Comp USA, and ended up buying the Sony DSC-P51 at Best Buy. 

The camera came with everything I needed to take pictures�but not right away. It had nickel metal hydride batteries and a charger, but the batteries were not charged. It also came with a 16 MB memory stick, a video cable, a USB cable to download the pictures to my computer, and a CD-ROM with the USB drivers and photo software.

The power button had to be held down for a couple of seconds before the camera would turn on, so at first I thought it didn�t work. Once I figured out that the problem was with the user, not the camera, I was ready to roll.

The camera has a LCD screen on the back. This allows the display not only of the photo previews but menus and other information about the camera. Some of the controls are selected and set with a round button similar to the old laptop �J� mouse. Selections are made by pushing on the top, bottom, left or right, then set by pushing straight in. Sometimes what I intended as a setting was interpreted as a different choice when I accidentally hit the edge of the button. Again, user error.

The camera has a 2X zoom, and can take photos up to 2.0 megapixel resolution. At the highest resolution, the memory stick can hold 16 photos. Additional memory sticks can be purchased.

The camera has several doors and ports�memory stick, battery, USB connection, video connection, AC power connection�and all of the covers remain attached to the camera when they are open. There is no problem keeping track of all the little covers.

The flash is quite adequate to take pictures in the dark, and the camera also has a twilight setting to help the user get the best possible pictures in low/fading light conditions.

Sony claims that the batteries will last for up to three hours or 3600 shots. I didn�t need to take nearly that many, so I don�t know whether that claim is true or not.

I did get the pizza pictures taken, uploaded into my computer, and delivered as I had promised. I have received confirmation that the photos were acceptable, but I don�t have the money yet.
