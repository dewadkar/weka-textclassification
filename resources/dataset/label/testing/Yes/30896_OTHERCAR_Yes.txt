            I have had my 1991 Toyota Tercel for almost nine years and outside of body work, which I will elaborate on later, I have never had a major repair.  I bought the car brand new in December of 1990 and I have never regretted it.  The car is small and provides great maneuverability and it is also extremely easy to park, a definite plus for me since I live so close to San Francisco.  I spent several years commuting over 150 miles round trip daily and my car has close to 200,000 miles on it.  I have not been the most faithful with routine maintenance such as oil changes and tune ups, but I still have not had any major problems.  I have never even had the timing belt replaced (I know, that's bad and I'm planning to have it done this month.)  This is the perfect car if you have to commute because the mileage is incredible.  When it was new I got about 35 miles to the gallon on the highway.  Nine years later, lacking tune ups, I still get about 32 mpg.  With gas prices today, especially in California, I'm counting my blessings.

I cannot speak technically about the safety of the car, but I can speak from personal experience.  I was hit by a big rig diesel truck on the highway at about 65 MPH.  My car was flipped perpendicular to the truck and pushed for about 100 yards before coming to a stop.  I was shaken up and picked glass out of scalp for about a week, but I walked away completely unharmed.  Amazingly, there was no damage to the frame so my car was repaired and I still drive it today.

Several of my friends have purchased Toyota Tercels since and every one of them is happy with their decision.<br><br>
