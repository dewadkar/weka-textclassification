            I got my digital camera last christmas because I was sick of taking pictures on a 35mm camera, paying the developing costs and then some of the pics wouldn't be any good. This was the cheapest digital camera there was that had a color LCD display, 1 megapixel resoultion, Auto flash, 2x digital zoom and compact flash slot. The camera came with only 2mb memroy which I found was not sufficent enough for my needs so I bought a 32mb memroy card so I can take about 90 on highest resoultion otherwise the internal memory takes 9 high res photos or 30 on low quality. The digital zoom only works on low quality which I found very annoying because I never use low quality. Everyone winges about the batteries not lasting enough but what did they expect, my advice is to get recharable batteries and a recharger which would cost about $15. The 1.6" LCD display sold me on this camera because it is so much easier to take a picture with it than without and I can see how my picture came out so if didn't come out well I just deleted it. The flash is good but don't do any close ups with it on otherwise the picture will be all white. The picture quality is out of this world! I haven't taken bad picture yet. The software was simple to install and easy to use but the serial cable is very annoying and slow so one thing to buy would be a USB compact flash card data transfer. It feels really good to hold, it's a nice size but some people might say its too big! but bigger is better!

THINGS I LOVE-
LCD display, picture quality, easy to use, good size.

THINGS I HATE-
battery consumption, can only use digital zoom when on low quality, serial cable, slow data transfer
