            I needed a set of wheels for work and my personal life and I didn't want to spend a fortune on a car, or its' expenses. I looked at new and pricing was too expensive. I bought this used 2001 Dodge Neon in Salsa Red in the 4 door base trim. It has all the things that I need, like Air conditioning and an Automatic trans-axle. I paid around $9000.00 for it and it had around 17,000 miles on it. I drove earlier versions of this car and was impressed with its peppy performance and good handling, and thought this would be a fun car to own. Already owning numerous Honda,Toyota motorcars, this Dodge is a break from the norm for me. Things I like: Very good room in this car,easy to see out of, Controls are easy to use and in the right places. Lots of cup holders for the thirsty driver and passengers. Effective Air Conditioning. Decent trunk space especially with rear seats folded for extra utility. Driving the Neon, one finds a peppy almost spirited driving experience here. The handling is great and the Neon stops very well too. No ABS on this car. I took this car to Las Vegas and the Neon did fine returning about 31mpg on the highway. Not the best, but consider that this car does not have an overdrive. It is a 3 speed trans-axle. The car is noisier and not nearly as polished and poised as my Honda and Toyotas were, but with the exception of my 1987 Integra ( Acura/Honda), these cars were boring to drive. My Neon invites me to have fun with it. Even its' forward looking style says "lets go now!."  Dislikes. Noise,vibration and harshness still need improvement. This car needs to go to finishing school here. The 4 gear overdrive would help the mileage too. 15" tires should be standard and not the 14" size. Other than these quibbles, the Neon is a competent, fun, and enjoyable car to drive and own, though I would probably would not recommend this car to my friends as a first choice because of the better Japanese competition for instance. If you can get one cheap however, than that would be the way to go. Then you would have a fun and enjoyable ride to Neon proportions.
