            I AVERAGE 30,0000 TO 35,000. MILES A YEAR ON MY CAR. THIS IS THE FIRST 
CAR IN THIRTY FOUR YEARS IN SALES I HAVE PUT ON 102,800 MILES IN THREE 
YEARS AND NEVER HAD MAJOR REPAIR COST!!! JUST NOW I PUT ROTARY ON BACK
BRAKES BUT OTHER THAN TIRES AND OIL CHANGE NOTHING!! THIS CAR HAS MORE
INSIDE ROOM THAN MY 1992 CADILLAC STS. RUNS SO QUIET I MUST LOOK AT MY
TAC TO MAKE SURE IT IS RUNNING AND NOT TRY TO RESTART. THE MOON ROOF 
EVEN WHEN OPEN IS QUIET. HAVE EXCELLENT VISION 360o. BEST CAR I HAVE
EVER OWNED!!!CAN NOT THINK ON ANY NEGATIVES.!!!JOINED TOYOTA 100,000.CLUB!
ANY ONE THAT WANTS VALUE AND DEPENDABLE WILL LOVE THIS CARE!!!<br><br>
