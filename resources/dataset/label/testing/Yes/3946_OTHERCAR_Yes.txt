            It's time for us to lease another car.   I've had a 4 door Mercury Sable for the last 3 years and the lease is up at the end of this month.   We already have a Saturn LS and have been extremely happy with the way the car handles, the low maintenance on the car and the fantastic service we received.

We, or I should say I decided I wanted a car larger than a sedan but not as big as an SUV, but I also wanted more cargo space.  I wanted a &quot;station wagon&quot;.  My kids think that this is going to be an ugly car from the 80's.

We looked at several different SUV's - a Chevy Blazer, Oldsmobile Bravada, Mitsubishi Montero Sport and a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.  Every one of them had uncomfortable back seats where your knees were almost up at your chin when seated in the back, except for the Laredo.  We also looked at the Saturn LW2 Wagon as well as the LW1 Wagon.  I was very surprised to find that the LW2 and LW1 had a roomier back seat than the other SUV's because our Saturn LS is very cramped in the rear.  The LW2/1 are not. To keep costs down (because I want to get my kitchen done this year), I've decided to lease the LW2 Wagon.

The LW2 is a 6 cylinder car, as opposed to the LW1 which is only 4 cylinders.  Some of the standard features on the LW2 are an alarm system (insurance discount), AM/FM CD/Cassette stereo, rear seat fold down armrest with cup holders (great if you have kids); cruise control; rear window washer/wiper; rear seat reading lamps; day time running lights (another insurance discount); foglamps; floor mats, dual airbags (another insurance discount).    You also get your car washed each time you bring it in for any type of service.

The LW2 is a smooth driving car - when we hit bumps in our Saturn LS, you feel every one - you don't feel the bumps in the LW2.  I don't have any complaints about the roominess in the front seat.  It's larger than the LS and I feel a lot more comfortable driving this car, or as a passenger sitting in the rear or in the front.   

We have the gold LW2 which looks nice.  I've see the LW2 in white, which I felt would be too hard to keep clean and also in blackberry and dark blue. 
We chose the gold because the darker colored cars get too hot in the summer.  I think the LW2 looks somewhat like an SUV with the height of an SUV. 

I'm leasing the Saturn LW2 for about $272.00 per month.  It comes with a 36 month maintenance warranty.  I feel I've been given a great deal on this car and it is well worth the money.

Although I haven't had to bring the LW2 in for service yet.  I know from past experience with the LS that the service area is fantastic - there are no double standards at Saturn - Women and Men are both treated as family members/customers when you walk in to their shop.

I hope no one takes offense to me saying this, but being a woman, there is a double standard when it comes to looking for a car.   I have walked in to numerous dealerships in the past couple of weeks to look at certain cars and I was ignored, they were not busy with other customers, they didn't want to be tied up speaking to me when a &quot;real&quot; prospect walked in the door.  I walked in to some of these same dealerships with my husband a few days later and we were immediately approached by salesmen.

I walked in to Saturn and was immediately asked if I needed assistance.  So I'll say this now I'm glad I didn't  get one of the other vehicles mentioned in this review - their dealerships don't deserve the business.
