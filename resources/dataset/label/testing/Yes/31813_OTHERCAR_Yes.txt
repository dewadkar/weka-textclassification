            We just switched from a 94 Accord (4-door) to a 2000 Civic (4door) because we heard that the sizes were comparable.  This has turned out not to be true.  The Civic still feels significantly smaller than the Accord.  However, in mitigation of this, the Civic handles extremely well, just as well as the Accord.  Also, unfortunately, we did not learn, until the delivery of the car, that the tape player is not standard (even after being told during the sales pitch that it was).  So we only have a radio.  This is a bummer.  Still, all things considered, the Civic LX 2000 is a good car, just small.  <br><br>
