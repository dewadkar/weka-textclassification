            I bought my Australian assembled 1990 Mitsubishi Magna GLX(a Sigma wagon) here in New Zealand this year as my first car. It is fitted with the 2.6 litre 4 cylinder Astron II engine which has now done 185000kms. It is quite reliable however it broke down on the 3rd day I owned it and needed a new igniter. I have had some problems with the electrics- the fuel guage 'dies' if it is filled less than 1/2 way and sometimes the car doesn't start due to battery connection problems. However it has excellent suspension especially on New Zealand's less-than-perfect roads. What I don't like about the car is its enormous understeer, body-roll and feather-light steering which makes it difficult to drive on the highway. The steering wheel takes about 3.5 turns from lock to lock which sends you winding away at the wheel if you are trying to park. Being the GLX model it has absolutely NO extras whatsoever and a dull grey vinyl interior.
 The acceleration won't blow your hat off and it has average fuel economy, but the engine is very smooth. 
It would be a good family vehicle or company car. It has a huge rear end which is good for transporting all the band equipment, bicycles or whatever. It's very spacious and a good alternative (in my opinion) to an anonymous minivan, but hardly exciting
Update: as I am in the process of selling my car, a potential buyer wanted it AA checked. As it turned out the car was in a major head-on crash before I bought it. A new front end has been welded on and some engine components replaced. It is rusty, the head gasket is about to blow and the pistons are only running at 10%. There is a moral to this story- have the car thoroughly checked before you buy it<br><br>
