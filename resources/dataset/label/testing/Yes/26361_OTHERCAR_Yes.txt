            I liked the Jimmy right off the bat just for the look of it.  It looked sporty and the white with the dark windows looked clean and cool.  I had no idea how much I would love it.  I have had only to change the oil on schedule, and change the battery since I bought it.  There have been no other problems.  Oh, I take that back, the daytime running lamps needed a spark plug change one time.
I dont feel as if I am going to flip over when I have to make a sharp turn.  There is ample cargo space in the back, even with my twelve disc CD changer sticking up from the floor of the cargo area.  My four year old and two year old can climb right in the back and into their carseats, unlike in my husband's big pick up truck.  I even had surgery and had no trouble climbing into the passenger seat, so it looks big but doesnt cause much of a hassle to get in and out of.
I would not suggest this car to you if you have more than two children in carseats.  I have just enough room for their carseats and myself and my husband.  That left no room to take an extra family member to Renaissance festival or any other outing.  This is the only reason I wish I would have bought the Yukon instead.  However, if you dont have the hassle of carseats, you can fit two adults upfront and three in the back.
A very clean, comfortable ride, very reliable with NO trips to the shop between purchase and now, start of 2002.  I purchased this vehicle used, in sept. 2000, less than a year after it rolled off the line.  No stooping to get kids in and out like the little car i had before, and no trouble getting them in and out like in bigger vehicles.
I have been more impressed than I could have hoped in this vehicle purchase.
