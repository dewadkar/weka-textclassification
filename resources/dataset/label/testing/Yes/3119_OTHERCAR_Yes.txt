            I bought my Elentra 2000 7 months ago and have driven it all the way to West Coast from Ontario and back (5000 miles).  My wife and I drove it like crazy for the last two months.  My CD player died and I had to use the warrentee so I've experienced the service as well.  In addition, I locked my car keys in the car so I have even used their road side assistance.

Overall I am very satisfied with the car.  I got great service everytime I needed one.  My CD player died in the US and US models have a different CD player so the dealer could not replace it.  However, they arranged a service company to service the CD player for me.  I had to go to them, so it was a little inconvinient but they did not charge me anything at all for that.  

Car has great features for its price and gives very good highway mileage.  However, city mileage is not very impressive.  In addition, it gets loud and consumes a lot of gas when it's pushed hard.  On the bright side it does give adequate power when pushed hard.

One other downside with the car is that people from some reason compare it with higher end cars.  People who drive Honda Accord compares it with Accord and don't find it very impressive.  Obviously!  However, compared to Civic - and not to ignore Civic's great resale value and reliability - Hyundai is cheaper, roomier and more fun to drive.  As a matter of fact I think Hyundai gives the most comfortable ride in its class.

Finally, I'd suggest that everyone checks out the car with an open mind.  It's a great value, but it's not a BMW...so there are a few things that can be improved (loud when pushed hard, not good city mileage etc.).  However, overall, it's the best buy.
