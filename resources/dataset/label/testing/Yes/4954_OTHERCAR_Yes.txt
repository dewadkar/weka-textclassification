            A great camera for the price - feature filled & easy to use.  The camera has multiple functions - from the automatic point-and-shoot mode, to manual modes (for those who know what they're doing.)  

What I find truly great about this camera, is its nearly perfect shots in &#147auto&#148 mode - literally every time.  I can't think of a single occasion where I got bad color from this camera - indoors or out.  This camera eliminates the need for me to start Photoshop color-correction on any of my pictures.  (Got things to sell on eBay?  Make your items stand out nicely with this camera's great quality pics!)  Even glossy surfaces come out great in this camera's pictures.  I have taken a picture of a mirror - just to see how it came out - and I got it <b>without any</b> backlight glare.  Absolutely amazing.  

The camera supports a variety of picture qualities - from small "e-mailable" settings, all the way up to massive high-res pictures in excess of a few megabytes.  Full-color Prints at 8 1/2 x 11 (full-page) come out excellent.  If you want to make regular-sized prints (even large ones!), this camera is a perfect replacement for your film camera.

This camera's zoom features are excellent.  The optical zoom will bring you up to 3x, with a digital enhancement up to 12x - for pinpoint shots that are not only close-up, but look good too.

Unlike other cameras I have used, this camera's small LCD screen doesn't consume massive amounts of battery life.  You get a good amount of pictures out of each battery recharge even with the screen on.  I can finally enjoy an LCD screen without having to spend hundreds of dollars on batteries - or wait 2 hours between every ten pictures.  

For people really into the way their pictures look, this camera has a wide variety of settings that can be specified in manual mode.  I have tried some of the settings &#150 however &#150 there are just so many possibilities you can have, that I just don&#146t have the time to go through everything.   Problem areas I have had with various shots are easily correctable through the manual modes.  You can adjust for lighting, time of day, shutter speed, and manual focus &#150 among other things.  It is a very well rounded camera in a very small package.  

Last but not least &#150 I must mention the small, solid package of the camera.  It fits right in your hand nicely &#150 and isn&#146t heavy or bulky like some other cameras (i.e. my old one) are.  If you had an old camera, you might need to get accustomed to the small package &#150 but &#150 once you get the hang of it, you&#146ll love it.
