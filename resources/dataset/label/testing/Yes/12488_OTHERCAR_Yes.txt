            I got my first job out of college and it was quite a distance away from my house and my 1986 Chevy Cavalier wasn't going to make it (45 miles each way).  So I went to the dealership to buy a used car.  I ended up buying a 1995 Chevy Beretta - White in November 1997.  I have put 60000 miles on it  in 2.5 years (total miles on it now - 92500)  I have taught my English husband to drive in this car and he is now driving it to work.  

I have to say, I really love this car.  I love the smooth ride and the way it looks.  It has alot of power and is a sports car but not a sports car. It is very reliable and I haven't had to replace anything big on the car as of yet (knock on wood).  

The only downside that I see is the brakes, but that is more a user error.  My husband drives in a very stoplight filled area and stops short alot.  As a result, I have had to change the brakes and rotors several times already.  

It is a very comfortable car and very roomy!  The trunk space is astronomical!

I would recommend this car to anyone without kids, as getting in and out of the back seat can be a little iffy.  It is great on gas mileage, but still has enough power to make it up those big hills!
