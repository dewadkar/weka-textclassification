            I bought my first RAV4 in 1996.  It's a 4wd 4door model and I have had nothing but great experiences with it!  It gets better gas mileage than the sticker stated!  I'm currently getting 23 miles to the gallon on regular gas around town and near 27 on the road! I have had no repair needs and the maintenance is handled by the dealer for the first few years.  This is why I have decided to buy a second Rav4.  

I used an on-line service to request a price quote on a 4 door, 4x4, automatic Rav4 with the power package.  They local Toyota dealership called me with a price of 20,176.00.  They tried to sell me a special tinted window package which was over 1300.00 more.  I am not interested in this so....no go.

The only negative I found was the wait I was told for the RAV4.  The dealer had few in stock and I was told I would have a wait of about 4 weeks.  

I haven't finalized the buy yet (hoping to get yet a better price through negotiation).


I thought you might be interested in why I bought my first SUV:

I choose this SUV because of 2 reasons.  The first is that I am handicapped and have difficulty getting in and out of normal cars.  They are too low to the ground and I just can't handle it.  Larger trucks are too high off the ground.  I don't have strength to climb up into them.  The second reason is the seating,  I have a back problem and the Rav4 seat is supportive and it is much more like sitting in an easy chair then a typical car seat!

I can't began to tell you how many different cars, truck and suv's I tried out before selecting the Rav4.  The Toyota Rav4 is certainly the best of this size suv on the market!  (the price is great too!)
