            I love my 1999 GMC Sierra Z-71 Extended Cab pickup.  I say that because  I had wanted a Chevy Silverado.  They are basically the same truck (although some Chevy faithful would beg to differ) except for the tag and the front grill.  I bought this truck because I had been in a 1993 Toyota pickup for 6 years and was ready for a change. I had looked at both the Sierra and the Chevy Silverado, but decided on the GMC based purely on looks.  

The GMC is a very well thought-out truck.  All of the controls are within reach and easy to use.  The owner's manual reads like a short novel because of the truck's features.  One of the features I like is the daytime driving light system. The sensors will either turn on a pair of small lamps in front for daytime driving, or will automatically turn on the headlights for driving at night.  It is a 4 wheel drive vehicle and the controls are dash mounted. If you are not familiar with 4 wheel drive operation you can depress the Auto 4WD button and it will set the drive train according to the amount of traction needed.  Other nice features are the speed controlled volume on the Radio/Cassette/CD player, and the rear view mirror which darkens to a pleasant green color when bright lights are detected behind you.  The cab is cavernous with ample room for 5 adults. This is a very comfortable truck for long trips. Rear A/C vents, angled seats, and cup holders make rear seat passengers as comfortable as possible.  The captains seats in this vehicle make you sit up high above the traffic.  

The truck is big and it tracks straight and true.  The ride is exceptionally smooth especially for a 4 wheel drive vehicle.  The engine, which is the 5.3L Vortec, is very strong!  While driving at night I accidentally drove into a long, muddy strip of road. Having experience with 4 wheel drive vehicles I was impressed with the responsiveness of this engine.  Even through the thickest part of the mud I could hear the engine revving strong and keeping those wheels turning to get me out of trouble.  I was impressed because this happened the day after I had bought the truck and I had yet to rev the engine. I had got used to this quiet soft-spoken engine that would get me to work and back. It is comforting to know that the Vortec engine is there, ready to roar (and that it does). 

If you are used to driving a Suburban/Expedition this truck should be no problem. I do like it's turning radius, which is even shorter than the Toyota pickup it replaced.  The only thing I don't like about this truck is the mileage.  Like I said, I was in a Toyota for 6 years previous and got used to 33mpg.  With the Sierra, I average about 16mpg, which is very good for a full-sized, 4 wheel drive truck, with a 270hp engine.  I get about 18mpg on the highway and about 11mpg when I have to really work the engine. All in all good mileage for this type of vehicle.It is an impressive looking truck and you will get a lot of people looking, so keep it clean. 

 Anyone looking for a well built, well thought out truck that has the horsepower to get you out of some sticky situations should strongly consider the GMC Sierra. I chose it over the Chevy because I think it is a much better looking truck. Check one out before you buy a Chevy. Others have because I see a lot more Sierras out there than I used to.<br><br>
