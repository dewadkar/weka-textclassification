            I went from a 1999 Jeep Wrangler Sport (4x4) to a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo (4x4) and I'm loving every minute of it!  I bought the vehicle because of the amount of room it has in the back to place my daughter and any extra camping supplies or groceries we might have at the time.  I take  the Grand Cherokee off-roading occasionally, and I the responsiveness is astounding.  The heavier weight as compared with the Wrangler does leave me wondering at times if it's going to perform the same tricks as my Wrangler did, but every time it pulls through the same rocks/sand/dirt/mud as smooth as silk.  The main things that I like about this vehicle is the smooth, soft ride that it has when it rides on the road, along with the handling characteristics on both wet and dry pavement.  (I have no worries of sliding or rolling this solid vehicle, it drives like my old Wrangler does... like it's on rails.)  The ABS brakes are top of the line, they have stopped me while I was standing on them to avoid a person slamming on the brakes at 65mph, and I did not hear any tire howl or loose control while I was steering (with one hand mind you.) to get out of the way of the accident.  If you have children, or even a loved one that rides with you, that alone is peace of mind.. it is for me.  I have the 6 cylinder with selec-trac 4-full/4-part-time/2-full/4-lo transfer case.  The shift from 2 wheel to either 4 wheel full or 4 wheel part-time is completely unnoticeable, except for the added traction and stability.  About the only thing I don't like about the vehicle is the 6 cylinder... if you have the ability, get the V8 model if you plan on doing anything more than leisurely trips around town with this truck.  Although the 6 will pull you out of the mud or through any rock you put it against (granted the wheel-wells will allow it that is...), when you are travelling into mountain terrain or towing something the extra power from the V8 is most welcome... else the 6 will stay in the high RPM range an uncomfortable amount of time.  

This is not for the person who goes off-road constantly with their vehicle, but if your like me and have a family (or just love a smooth ride to work instead of bouncing continuously from your off-road suspension/tire sets) along with being able to take the boss of someone out to lunch without getting stares from them, this is definitely the vehicle for you.  (pretty  facade, yet great off road.. nice combo.)<br><br>
