            My previous vehicle was a Ford Winstar which I have had driven for the past 4 years.  I prefer leasing vehicles because of the miles I put on them.  My lease is usually for a period of two years.  When my lease was up on the Winstar I decided to try the Ford Explorer.

My first impression of the vehicle was the interior which is very roomy and comfortable.  All the controls are at easy to get to and the sound system is very good, especially the CD portion of the system.  The only problem I found with the interior is the area between the seat and the console.  When a object fall in to this area it is very difficult to remove.  The seats are very comfortable and are easy to access from the outside when entering the vehicle. I have the four door unit and even the back entry is easy to access.  The storage area is large and holds a lot of items.

The exterior of the vehicle is well balanced and has a nice look.  I have found people looking at the vehicle when it is parked.  The remote locking system is easy to use as well.  I have the 6 cylinder model and I am not to happy with the gas mileage.  I am getting less than 18 mile to the gallon on the expressway.  The city driving is not much better.  All in all the Ford Explorer is a nice vehicle to drive especially on long trips.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a sport utility.<br><br>
