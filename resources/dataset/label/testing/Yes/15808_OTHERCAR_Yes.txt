            I bought a 99 Black Solara SLE V6 in April 1999. I needed a car that has more pizzaz (style &amp; performance) than a standard mid-sized sedan (Camry/Accord) but was not willing to compromise on quality or to shell out more money than i could justify. Also i wanted to get a 2-door which is PRACTICAL for daily-life.

What i love about this car? Everything! From the way it looks to the way it feels and drives. Handles very predictable, accelerates briskly, well-balanced smooth ride with excellecnt sound-proofing. EXCELLENT sound system (JBL 200W 8-speakers) and automatic climate control. Lavish and practical interior. And to top it all, Toyota's quality &amp; reliability. The car holds its value pretty well with a decent devaluation. If this car had heated seats, neon lights and a navigation system, it would've been badged as a Lexus. Solara actually got more rear-seat room than a Mazada Millenia! I have 4 and even 5 passengers several time on a 120 mile drive and nobody EVER complained about the room or seat comfort. Read that it could be pushed to 135mph... i believe it is true ;) Oh, almost forgot, the transmission, it is silky smooth &amp; intelligent (decides whether to use sports-shift or economy shift by observing your driving habit and mood at the moment). I am a &quot;stick-shift&quot; person but i never regret getting this auto. 

I considered Accord Coupe but Solara was so much more REFINED in every aspect that i got to give in to it. Now it is over an year, i never had even a a single problem with it and still i enjoy and anticipate driving it every time.

If you need a touring-performance &amp; handling of a coupe with sedan-like room &amp; comfort and excellent reliability &amp; resale value, this is the best QUALITY vehicle you can get at this price. Anything more than that and you are paying for the brand name.
