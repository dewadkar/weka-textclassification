            We had a Suburban and a Pickup truck but nothing that was just right
for that quick trip to the grocery store or high school.  We had
never owned a typical 4-door sedan and didn't know if we would even
like one.  What to do?  Rent a few and see how they were.  Tried the
mid-size Nissan Altima, Olds Intrique, Chevrolet Malibu to name a
few.  The Malibu ended out on top.  The price was right, almost 
everything included for the $18,000 MSRP and the cash back bonus
made it even better.  The new 175 HP engine didn't hurt either.
The size is not too small, not too big, it's just right.  With two
teenage daughters coming of driving age pretty quick I really wanted
something that was easy to manuever in every day traffic.  Dollar
for dollar the Malibu has more standard equipment than everyone
in their class.<br><br>
