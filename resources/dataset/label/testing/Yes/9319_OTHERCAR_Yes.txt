            As far I as am concerned, this is the ultimate buy for a great muscle car.  The Supra provides some of the best bang for the buck next to the Mustang and the Camaro, yet it runs better than the Cobra version of the Mustang and the Z28 of the Camaro, both of which cost the price of a Turbo Supra.  The turbo version of this cars produces an un-godly 320 horsepower and 315 pounds of torque which is truly impressive in a car this size.  This car will set you back about 35000 dollars, and you had better be prepared for some after market costs such as major tune ups and items you will want to add this this gem.  The turbo model is usually chosen with a 6 speed manual transmission since it is great for racing, however, for the practical traffic commuter, it comes with a 4 speed automatic transmission.  The Supra is truly a car that can compete with the big boys such as the Porsche Boxster, the Cheverelotte Corvette, and the BMW M3.  This car is what you need if you want to show off and get some attention.  One more great feature of the Supra turbo is that it comes with 17&quot; rims, however, you should grab some 20 inchers to really show it off.  This car will keep you busy and is recommended for the motorist who can mess around with the mechanics of this car and fix it themselves.
