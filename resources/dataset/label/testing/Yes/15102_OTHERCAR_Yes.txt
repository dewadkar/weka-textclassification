            About to give birth to my first child, I needed an upgrade from my 1995 Nissan 200 SX and there was no doubt in my mind I wanted a Nissan Altima.  (when a woman knows what she wants NO ONE or NOTHING is going to change her mind!).  

Head strong that I am, I did my research &amp; headed for the car lots.  I was having trouble finding a 5 speed used Altima so decided it was time to buy new again.  I wanted a 4 door Nissan Altima in Dusk Blue &amp; it had to be a 5 speed with cruise control and a cassette player or i would keep what i had &amp; suffer with 2 doors.  

5 speeds are hard to come by especially when Nissans were about to come out with a new model (2000).  A Nissan lot finally found me the 5 speed ALTIMA I was looking for. . it came complete with cruise control, AM/FM radio, CD &amp; cassette player, and keyless entry keychain.  I was so excited.  I traded in my old car &amp; was out the door in no time.  

The 1999 Altima is a smooth riding vehicle with easily accessible features.  I love having 4 doors &amp; the CD &amp; cassette players are great when all the radio stations are playing commercials at the same time.  Cruise control stays at a pretty consistent speed.  

The Altima has a very large trunk space (great for long trips--amazing how much stuff you can shove in there!).  It has convenient cup holders in the center of the front seats and a storage space for tapes and CD's.  Also storage on sides of doors.  I get anywhere from 28-32 miles per gallon in local driving areas.  The heater is best. . heats quickly, usually within 1 mile of driving.     <br><br>
