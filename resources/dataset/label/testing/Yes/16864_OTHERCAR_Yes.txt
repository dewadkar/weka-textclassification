            The main reason for choosing a Sony Mavica was that I had used the FD-73 in the past at work and liked it.  I knew I wanted a Sony Mavica, but perhaps a newer version.  With the advent of the FD-90, I knew I had found what I wanted.  And, I am quite pleased with it.  

I have had a very positive experience using the FD-90.  The pictures are so clear and it's very simple to use.  I also like the simplicity of using floppy disks with the camera rather than having to deal with cables, ports and converters.  I also like the features of being able to take photos in black and white, negative format, and sepia.  The time and date function that allows it to superimpose on the pictures makes it easy to archive disks in date sequence, too.   

With a baby due any day, I am sooooo looking forward to getting to take digital pictures of him and sending them to all my friends and family.  My Mavica FD-90 will be right there in the delivery room.  Go Sony!! You're the best.<br><br>
