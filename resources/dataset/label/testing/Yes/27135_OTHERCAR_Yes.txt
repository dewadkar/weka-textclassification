            What fool would name a car "Avenger" when people are increasingly and legitimately concerned about road rage? Go figure. Daimler Chrysler wisely dropped that moniker on the next generation of this car. Starting with 2001 models, the sporty coupe shares the "Stratus" name with a four-door sedan. So, no, it was not the name that attracted me to my 1998 Avenger ES. It was, quite simply, the looks. I can't think of another car of its type and price range that has styling so daring AND attractive. And, lucky for me, the Avenger not only looks good, it is good.

I purchased the car used in June 1999 with about 12,000 miles on the odometer. It is "loaded," with every option except the Infinity sound system. Mine is the "premium" sound system with both CD and cassette players and multiple speakers and it is quite good. The car is equipped with a V6 and automatic, air, sunroof, cruise, leather interior, power seats, power windows and alloy wheels. The engine is smooth and sounds the way a sporty car should sound. The car is quick and handles like a dream. Fuel economy is in the high 20s on the highway. The driving environment is excellent. The power seat seems almost infinitely adjustable and should be fine for anyone old enough to drive. All the controls are handy and easy to use. The interior, front and rear, is HUGE for this type of car. So is the trunk, and the rear seats fold down to provide more if needed. The materials, fit and finish of the interior are excellent. Minor gripes: the glove compartment holds just a little more than a thimble; the ashtray is under your right elbow; another cup holder would be nice. But overall, the Avenger drives and feels like a more expensive car -- except for one thing. At Interstate highway speeds, there is too much road noise to fully appreciate the nice stereo. For that reason -- and only that reason -- I do not recommend the car for someone who racks up most of their miles on the highway. On the other hand, some after-market sound-deadening work might make a big difference. Or perhaps a different set of tires. Don't know. I haven't tried either.

I have saved the best for last. In two years, I have put 25,000 miles on the car without a single problem. My repair cost is zero. Not a rattle, a shake or a stutter, and it seems as solid as the day I bought it. I like that.
