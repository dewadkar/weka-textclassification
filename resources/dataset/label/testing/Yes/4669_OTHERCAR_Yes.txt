            I had a '96 Cavalier up until a year ago.  The car was in my mother's name,and we felt it was time I got a new one in my own name, so I traded in my Cavalier.  That car was a very reliable car.  There were very few things I didn't like about the car.  From a hail storm, the car received extensive damage, more than most cars did.  On an insurance scale, the car rated a 17 for safety, which is rather high.  The higher it is, the worse.  The glove compartment latch had broken.  I felt that that latch was made very poorly, and bodily damage to the car occurred too easily.  The car received body damage when I wasn't in it.  It had $600.00 gravel damage from another vehicle spinning its tires. 

Those are the only complaints I have about that car. I never had mechanical problems with it and it had 50,000 miles on it when I traded it in.  I loved how smooth it run, the space inside, the gas mileage, the look of the car.  It was a powerful little car, and I would love to have another.  I always had fun driving it, and loved showing it off until everyone else got one too.

I think someone who likes nice looking cars, reliability, low maintenance cars, would be interested in this car.  But if you would like to have a car that no one else has, then I don't suggest it.  <br><br>
