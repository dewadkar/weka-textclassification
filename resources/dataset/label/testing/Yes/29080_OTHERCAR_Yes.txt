            Let me begin by saying that I am very rich and have 2 of these babies.  I am very discerning taste and only like the best.  This car, the Range Rover 4.6 HSE Callaway Edition, is the best SUV i own. I have a hummer, lexus lx470, and a nuclear tank.  This one beats them all. The leather is soft as can be, the Harmon Kardon stereo is better than the one in my movie theater at home, and the electronic satellite naviation system gets me around all the time.  The 4.6 litre engine is very powerful and gets the job done with easy; great acceleration and pickup.  The price is a bit steep but i can afford it because i own Microsoft, IBM, Yahoo, and Ambiance The Store for Lovers. Good Day.<br><br>
