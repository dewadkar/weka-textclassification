            I bought this camera for about $500 from AbesOfMaine.com, a terrific company. The price seems high, but that included an extra battery (which aren't cheap), extra memory, a filter and a carry case, so by and large, I got a lot of stuff for not a lot more money. The camera on its own was closer to $400.

I'm NOT a professional photographer. I take pictures the way most people do -- at family events, camping trips, etc. And since I'm not a professional photographer, I tend to take a lot of really bad shots. I got a digital camera to eliminate 1) the cost of film, 2) the cost of developing film, 3) the use of all the chemicals they use to develop film, and 4) the paper they use to print pictures. And if I do decide to print a picture, I can at least make sure it's a picture I like first.

Like most people, I did a LOT of shopping before I bought the DSC-S85. It was the highest resolution camera I could afford at the time, and I love it: At 4.1 megapixels, it prints *exquisite* 8 x 10 (and even larger!) pictures. I find the menus easy to navigate, and I've even used the MPEG recorder a few times. But I will say that if taking movies is what you're after, look somewhere else. While the DSC-S85's MPEG feature will suffice in a pinch, it's nowhere near good enough to be called a digital movie camera. (HINT: DSC stands for Digital STILL Camera.)

I've found that the S85 has held up well through lots of travel and lots of temperature changes. The software is ridiculously easy to use, and it generally takes just a few minutes to transfer photos from the camera to the computer.

Changing the memory card and/or battery is simple and takes a few seconds.

For those like me, who appreciate a point-and-shoot camera, this is fantastic. For those who lean more toward professional photography, or who like to have more control over the camera's settings, you can set the aperture manually, focus manually, etc. 

I'd say the one drawback to this machine is the shutter speed. It's tough to get a decent shot of something moving quickly. I also wish I could get a panorama or wide-angle lens for it, but alas, such is not the case. Nevertheless, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks, and I'll be touting this camera until they bury me.

A few tips: 1) Invest in an extra battery for this camera. No machine in the world will last forever without a charge, and running out of juice just when something interesting is happening sucks. 

2) Invest in extra memory cards. They're tiny to carry with you and you'll be glad you had them when you use up one card.

3) After I took a phenomenal picture at very low resolution and spent a year kicking myself for it, I learned to always take pictures at the highest resolution possible. If it's a bad picture, delete it. If it's a great picture, you'll be happy.
