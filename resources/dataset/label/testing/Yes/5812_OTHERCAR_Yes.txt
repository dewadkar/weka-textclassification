            I bought this camera in October to get ready for the Holidays, to replace my old Olympus camera (D-260L) which I got a few years ago and really liked.  I am very happy with the Olympus D-490 Zoom.  It has a plethora of features (many of which I haven't even used yet -- like panorama and manual ISO settings), and is very easy to use.  The zoom is excellent (3X optical and 2X digital), and the optical zoom toggle switch is conveniently located right at your right hand index finger.  

The menus are very descriptive and simple, with one glaring exception (which, by the way, relates to the only CON I can report with respect to the camera -- the manual sometimes is lacking).  This exception is that you may not be able to figure out how to change the camera to SHQ-TIFF (the highest quality).  I literally had to call Olympus to figure this out, because there was nothing in the manual describing it.  For those of you who have this camera and may not know, when you want to change to SHQ-TIFF mode, you put the cursor on SHQ mode and hold down the up button for a few seconds and it will switch.  

The photo quality ranges depending on the quality setting you choose.  I keep mine on HQ for normal shots, and the camera has delivered clear, crisp shots with excellent color.  I have tried the upper settings (SHQ and SHQ-TIFF -- both of which eat up the Smart Media cards pretty quickly -- an 8MB card will hold about 5 SHQ pics and 1 SHQ-TIFF pic) and, again, there were excellent results.  I myself don't really have too much of a need for these higher pixel settings, but it's nice to have them if I ever do.  I have printed a few photos (on and HP 800 series) as 8x10's, 5x7's and 3x4, and I have gotten excellent results in all cases.

The software that comes with the camera is good (maybe a little lacking in some areas -- I liked good old Adobe) and is adequate for the average used to get results.  Everything is easy to install, and my computer recognized the camera immediately.  I recently have added a Smart Media reader to my equipment, which is very handy to have.

Overall, this camera is a great choice for the money outlay.
