            One of the world's great supercars, the Ferrari 550 Maranello.  This car is a car that words can not describe.  From the sound of it's 485 horsepower engine, to the traditional metallic clink of the shifter, it has it all. I bought this car because I wanted to see what Ferrari was really capable of producing, in their top model, and they do produce.  It's engine sounds like music, and the acceleration feels like you have been strapped to a giant slingshot and then fired.  I love this car and there is nothing I hate about it.  The only thing that I can think of that I don't like, is constant dealer service.  This car has to be kept in prime condition.  Driving this car is a an expierence one will not forget.  When the engine is first started, it has the whirl of a Formula One engine until it idles.  Even stomping on the gas in second and third gears from a complete stop still will induce massive wheel spin.  Only those who appreciate the true beauty of Ferrari should buy this car.<br><br>
