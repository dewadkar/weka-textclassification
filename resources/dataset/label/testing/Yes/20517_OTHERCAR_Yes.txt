            I had looked for a "deal" on a luxury sport car for about a year and came upon a 1991 Sterling SL in a used car lot. This was 1994 and Sterling were already quite rare as production was halted in 1994. If you are not familiar with a Sterling, the car is a joint venture automobile with Rover supplying the body and interior and Acura the motor and transmission. Anyway, I bought the car for $7,000 and have been driving ever since.
The car has its share of true British blood with its beautiful leather interior and sometimes quirky wiring phenomenons. The car locked my keys in the ignition with me in my house. I swear!! The motor and transmission has been like any Honda motor and transmission; well behaved, reliable and very smooth.
The Sterling has been the most satisfying driving experience in my 30 years of being behind the wheel. I have not had a visual sighting of another Sterling (I live in San Antonio TX) in almost 3 years but continue to enjoy this unique experience that all Chevy and Ford drivers will never know.
