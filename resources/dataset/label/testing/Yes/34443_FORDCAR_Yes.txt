            I've driven Chevy 1500 series 4x4's and Dodge Ram series 4x4's, but I have never experienced such enjoyable 4x4 driving until I drove my parent's 2000 Ford F250 SuperCab.  I drove the truck on my parent's farm, through fields and terraces, and even through a creek bed (don't tell, I wasn't supposed to go anywhere offroad, whoops, I just couldn't resist)  

The automatic four-wheel drive feature comes in pretty handy, just push a button and you're in four-wheel drive, push it again and you're in two-wheel drive...Four, two, Four, two... The ride was pretty smooth considering the terrain. 

Enough about my fun driving through the fields, let's get to the heart of this review. For the most part, it tells about my experiences with the truck, the extras that I liked in it, and a few precautions involved with owning a truck as big, powerful and as nice as the one I drove.

I also drove the truck a few hours on the highway pulling a trailer, and I was amazed at how smooth the ride was.  The massive size of the truck puts the driver about 6 feet off the ground and combined with the smooth ride, it feels almost like you're flying. Although the speed sensitive steering took a little getting used to,(the steering wheel becomes quite sensitive the faster the truck moves.  One inch at 60 mph can really jostle you) the rest of the ride was quite enjoyable. 

The interior is covered in leather, and full of extras.  I had power everything, CD player with great sound, very comfortable seats and a folddown back seat.  One of my favorite options is side doors that BOTH open.  Even though the truck I drove was just a SuperCab, not a QuadCab, both side doors still opened.  

This extra space was great for loading up my dogs, and would be great for anyone that had to put the kids in the back, or groceries, or whatever else anybody would put in the back seat. This feature added a few hundred points to my ease of living meter.  If you are going to buy any truck, Ford, Dodge, or Chevy, make sure and get 4-way SuperCab doors.  

The truck has enough power for anything that I might ever want to use it for.  I pulled a U-Haul trailer behind it for 3 hours and almost forgot that it was there.  The truck I drove had a Triton V8 engine, I think it was 5.4 cubic liters, but I am not positive about that.  The truck accelerated fairly good on the highway, especially considering that I had a U-Haul hooked to the back.  It does tend to eat gas though. 

I think I averaged about 15 miles per gallon on the highway, which isn't bad for a truck this size, but with gas prices as high as they are, this might be something to think about when buying.  It could cost you $50 bucks for a single fill-up.  

As I said before, this is a BIG truck.  I have to be very careful when pulling into my parent's garage.  My dad has put a few dents in the mirrors when he has miscalculated by just a few inches.  The side mirrors are quite big, which give great range of sight, but also stick out so far that you feel like any oncoming traffic might rip the mirror right off the truck.  I always have to fold in one of the mirrors, if not both, when I go through any drive-thru restaurant, bank, cleaners, etc.  

Do you really need a truck this big?  My parent's needed the truck on the farm for pulling large loads of hay and pulling trailers with horses, etc, but even for jobs like that, I feel that a smaller truck would do the job.  This truck does more than the job, it passes every test that they have put it through, but for me personally, I could be satisfied with a smaller, less powerful truck, that gets better gas mileage, and doesn't require the precision of a semi driver to do simple tasks like going through the drive-thru at my bank.
