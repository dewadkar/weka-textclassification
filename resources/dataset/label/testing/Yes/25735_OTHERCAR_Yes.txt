            The Volkswagen New Beetle is one of the most trendy cars on the road, which can be seen as either a pro or a con.  As a pro, people tend to stop me and ask about the car.  A lot of people want to see the inside, and it's nice to meet new people.  One of the best feelings was when I first bought my 1999 New Beetle and driving off the lot, someone else in a Volkswagen New Beetle honked and waved at me.  For weeks, every person I saw in a Beetle, new or old, waved and smiled.  
A con of such a trendy car, however, is that people notice your car more often.  I live in a quiet suburban area, yet my car has been keyed twice!  I have never had this problem with a car in the past, having owned a Toyota Camry and a Honda CRX.  So having a cute, trendy car can be both an advantage and a drawback. 
The car itself runs wonderfully, has never had an engine problem and is a pleasure to drive.  One thing you need to get used to when you drive this car, however, is the inordinately large dashboard.  It is about the size of a small card-table.  When I first got the car, a friend gave me a table cloth, in case I ever wanted to have a picnic.  The dashboard is not obtrusive, although it does take some getting used to.
There have been some small mechanical problems with my car, and with the New Beetles of some co-workers.  The heat/AC sometimes comes out of different vents than it should, the small plastic covers for the power outlets (for cell phones, etc.) won't close or fall off completely, and the floor mats tend to shift all over the place.  These are small prices to pay for a car that is an overall success.  I am very happy with the car overall, and recommend it to anyone who is not a perfectionist about their car's internal workings.
