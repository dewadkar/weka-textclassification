            Ok so with all that in mind there I was looking at new SUV's.  I immediately eliminated the toy SUV's like the Chevy/Geo Tracker, the Honda CRV, the Suzuki's, and similar vehicles.  I also eliminated those land yachts like the For Expedition, the new For Excursion, the Chevy Surburban, as well and any of the ever-growing hoard of $40,000+ SUV's out there.  What was left was a fine bunch of &quot;cars&quot;.  The Ford Explorer, the Chevy Blazer, the Nissian Pathfinder, the Nissan Xtera, etc.
For a variety of reasons including price, styling, reputation and comfort I purchased the Chevy Blazer.  This came as no surprise to those that know me � considering this was my fourth Chevy.  Don't get me wrong � I have owned Fords, two Chrysler products, a Buick, and a Toyota.  Chevy's are simply the best for the money.

The blazer was simply the best value � the most equipment for the lowest price.  Thousands less that a similarly equipped vehicle from a competition and the best looking &quot;car&quot; in the bunch.

The Blazer I purchased had two minor defects in the first two months.  A loose front shock and defective gas cap.

All and all ... a great vehicle for a great price for those who need a big car and/or dependable transportation in any weather.
