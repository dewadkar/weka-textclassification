            I was looking for a vehicle to replace a station wagon.  I have 4 dogs and they often travel with us to Vermont for weekends in the country.  Our other car is a mid-size sedan with a V-6 and 5 speed manual.  I thought of buying a pickup truck, but after looking at several different types of vehicles, I decided to buy some sort of small SUV. I looked at the Subaru Forester, Honda CRV, Nissan Xterra and Toyota RAV4. I thought the Subaru looked too much like another station wagon, the materials in the Xterra looked cheap, and I just don't like the CRV's styling.  I bought the RAV4 primarily because I like its looks and I admire Toyota's reputation for high quality vehicles.  I have now had the car almost 6 months and it is by far the best vehicle purchase I have ever made.  The vehicle handles extremely well, has plenty of room for the dogs in the back (with the rear seats folded)and it has great brakes.  I am 6'3&quot; tall and find front leg and head room to be more than ample.  The seats are small, but comfortable and provide good lumbar support.  The controls are easy to use and were somehow &quot;familiar&quot; even the first few days I drove the vehicle.

My RAV is dark green with silver cladding and bumpers and it has privacy glass, security system, keyless entry and a CD player, in addition to the usual power options.  The seating position is perfect for me and I love having a commanding view of the road ahead.  The vehicle could use a little more power, but the engine's power is more than adequate in most situations.  This is the first car I have ever bought with an automatic transmission and it shifts very smoothly and is much more pleasant to drive in heavy traffic here in the northeast corridor than a car with a standard transmission. It is, however, almost impossible for me to get in or out of the back seats!  The back door entries are extremely small and not made for someone my height.

On the other hand, the rear cargo door is remarkably well designed and makes loading and unloading items extremely easy.  My dogs can jump in and out effortlessly, and since 3 of them weigh between 82 and 115 pounds, I am quite happy not having to assist them in getting in or out of the vehicle!  My gas mileage has been good, averaging about 24 miles per gallon.  There are no squeaks or rattles, but the center console is a bit flimsy and not in keeping with the quality of the rest of the vehicle.  Wind noise is a bit high at highway speeds, but I don't find engine or road noise to be at all objectionable.  The RAV's engine is extremely quiet and refined for a 4 cylinder engine.

I would recommend the RAV4 to anyone who wants an SUV, but doesn't need or want to drive a huge, lumbering, ill-handling gas guzzler.  I love to drive and the RAV4 is a good choice for people who enjoy good handling on twisting back roads.  It is not meant for anyone who enjoy serious off road driving,  nor is it a good choice for a family with older children.  (They won't fit in the back seat very well).  All in all, I would summarize the RAV4 as youthful, stylish, solid, well-built and fun to drive.  And this is the first new vehicle I have ever purchased that has not had to go back to the dealer for at least some minor adjustments or repairs.

I have complete confidence in this vehicle and look forward to many years of trouble free driving.  And the resale value is awesome.  I financed the car for four years, and after only 6 months into ownership I could already sell the car if I wanted to and still be a few thousand dollars ahead of my car loan. I could trade it and still have about $500-$750 in trade equity.  With American cars, I have always been &quot;upside down&quot; on the car loan for at least 2-years.  RAV4's are not the cheapest vehicles of their type at the time of initial purchase, but they more than make up for that when it is time to trade or sell them.  That is the definition of real value.  People too often look at the initial purchase price and don't take resale value into consideration when looking at the total costs of ownership of a vehicle.  I made that mistake myself a few times, but no more. Keep in mind that resale values are a reflection of the quality of a vehicle, and the esteem with which the buying public public views a vehicle.    <br><br>
