            Last year my husband and I took six months to travel and were going to keep our family and friends posted about what we were seeing and experiencing via a Web Page called Travelinghands. We started our trip in Australia, where we met some great people that let us use their computer to update our page. When we were about to leave there we found that it wouldn't be as easy as we thought to find places to scan our pictures and were finding that developing the film was getting expensive. We went looking for a digital camera and decided on the Kodak DC 210 Plus because of the great options it offered us. There is a 2x Zoom and Macro Focus that allowed me to take great pictures of the flowers in the different countries we visited. We also got the Compact Flash Card that enabled us to load the pictures right onto our laptop to create our Web Pages. Then we just put it all onto a disk, went to an Internet cafï¿½ and loaded the new pictures onto the page. This saved us hundreds of dollars on developing pictures that we never used and allowed us to retake pictures that didn't turn our as we wanted. This camera would be great for anyone that takes a lot of pictures. <br><br>
