            Last spring we got a new car, a 1999 ford taurus.  We are very happy with it.  Why wouldn't we be?

We got a great deal from priceline.com but the car is reliable.  Before this taurus, we had a 1989 taurus for 10 years, older than our son.  We NEVER had any major problems with it. Just a great, dependable car.

The taurus is roomy and a reliable car.  And it is not very expensive.  We usually never have to take it in for repairs.  People compliment my husband on his lovely new car, why not.  It is perfect.

I think anyone wanting to buy a new car should definetly go test drive a taurus.  The people are friendly and helpful, but most importantly the car is great!<br><br>
