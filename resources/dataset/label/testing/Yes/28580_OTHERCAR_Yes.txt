            The 2000 Jeep Wrangler is a 2-door, 4-wheel drive, convertible top, compact sport utility. The Wrangler is Jeep's smallest sport utility and the only one with a convertible top. The Wrangler caters to the individual who seeks open-air fun and the freedom to go nearly anywhere. With more than 55 years of heritage, the Wrangler continues to deliver excellent off-road capabilities. Although the Wrangler maintains a reputation of simplicity and rugged durability, a 1997 major redesign has incorporated many of the comfort and convenience features buyers have come to expect in a daily driven vehicle. Jeep wants to attract more women into buying these vechiles so they made new design refinements. MSRP starts around $14,500 for a basic SE,with a fully loaded Sahara topping out at around $24,000. The 2000 Wrangler is a carryover, with add-a-trunk redesign and new radios. Although it's fun to drive, it is really bumpy and uncomfortable. An automatic is no fun to drive in this vehicle, the manual transmission will help the engine last longer but if your an off-roader go with the automatic. I have known many people with Jeeps and they said they are really fun to drive, which I agree.  If your looking for a great time while driving and do not care about hitting every small little bump and bouncing out of your seat, get a Wrangler!!
