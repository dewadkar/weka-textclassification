            I have only drove one car in my life and that car is a 1987 jeep cherokee. Although, it wasn't the best car it got the job done. When I decided that that it was time to buy a new car I narrowed the choice down to the Nissan Xterra for a lot of reasons.

 Comfort- the high back bucket seats provide a great place to sit if you are cruising down the interstate or muddin' off road. Safety- it comes equipped with anti lock brakes and driver and passenger side airbags. My Xterra is equipped with an automatic 4speed and 4 wheel drive which comes in handy in the snow and when I want to have some fun off road. The Xterra handles excellent off road compared to other vehicles that my friends take off road. I have drove their Chevy Blazers, Ford Explorers and Toyota 4runners and all pale in comparison to my Xterra. It rips through the off road with ease and comfort.

There is a convenient roof basket in which you can store up to 30 pounds of gear if you need the extra space inside. The rear has enough leg room for the tallest of passengers and there are power plugs in the front and rear on the vehicle. The back lift gate is very light and also has a compartment to hold a first aid kit. The back seat also folds down for ease. The factory stereo packs enough punch for even the loudest bass freaks. If you are looking for a new Sport utility vehicle you should look no further than the Nissan Xterra. Go test drive one today. You wont be disappointed<br><br>
