              My wife and I bought our first Neon in 1995. It was the bare bones model and lasted us 75,000 trouble free miles! Just changed the oil, put tires on it! It was NEVER aligned!
    So, I decided that it was time to upgrade to the Neon 2000. I test drove the Mazda 626, Nissan Sentra and other vehicles in it's class and price range. None of them really carried the full package as did the Neon.
  We upgraded to the fully loaded BLACK Neon. It turns a lot of heads and is a quick car. The trunk is a LOT larger than the old Neon and the seats are much more supportive.
   The vehicle is also a lot more fun-to-drive. It gets great gas mileage (25-35mpg depending on who's driving and where) We already have 7000 miles on it in two months. The wife drove from Washington to Arizona and back with no problems. The cruise control works excellent and the sound system is excellent!
   One small draw back. The doors open WAY too far. When you get into the vehicle, you feel like you have to have &quot;monkey&quot; arms to reach the handle to close the door.
    A new safety feature for the 2000. This vehicle has the new &quot;two stage&quot; air bags. Meaning, that during low impact accidents when the impact is large enough to engage the air bags, the air bags will deploy at two different stages. This will reduce any facial injuries during the low impact accidents that happen most of the time.
    The interior is a lot quieter than previous model Neons and the dash layout ranks &quot;High&quot; on my scale compared to other vehicles. The speedometer and gauges have a white back-round with black numbers during the daytime, but it reverses at night! A very cool and eye soothing feature.
   The fuel gauge is also the most accurate one I have even seen. That is probably attributed to the way it checks the fuel level. The Neon 2000 has the standard fuel gauge and also a fuel metering device. With the old standard tank &quot;level&quot; device, it reads the fuel level, but not totally accurate (as most of you know, you seem to always have that little extra fuel, even though it reads &quot;E&quot;) On this Neon, when it reads &quot;E&quot; on the fuel gauge, you better get fuel. With the new fuel metering feature, the gauge is always accurate. 
    The shifter is very secure and we opted for the manual transmission. Not because it was cheaper, but because it gives you a little more power. On the old Neon, we would have a load full of people and pull a hill near by our house, and would have to downshift to 4th in order to keep up with traffic. With the Neon 2000, just leave it in 5th and stay off of the gas. Otherwise, you will continue to accelerate up the hill!
    As you can see, my wife and I are very happy with this little gem.
With all the new features and more power (do I hear a Tim Allen grunt in the back-round?) this vehicle out class's them all.<br><br>
