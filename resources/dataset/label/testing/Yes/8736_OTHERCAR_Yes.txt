            My whole family loves the fun and easy use of this camera.  The on screen menu choices make selections easy for all ages.  There is also a microphone included and you can add up to 10 seconds of sound to any photos. You can listen to these messages thru the camera or your computer. There is a solar panel on the camera so when you are outside it it uses the sun to light the LCD screen for better visibility and battery conservation.  It has a &quot;hot shoe&quot; for an additional flash and threads so you can add a variety of additional lenses. It comes with an 8 meg CompactFlash memory card.  The finished product is always crisp and clear! We love it!<br><br>
