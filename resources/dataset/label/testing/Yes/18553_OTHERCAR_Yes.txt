            I acquired this car from my parents after I turned 16 and got a license.  It had over 160k miles on it at that time.  It is now 3 years later and I still have the car and it is running great. (Planning a party for when it hits 200k soon).  I have had no major problems with the car and there has been just typical stuff that that goes wrong with cars when they get old.  My parents bought the car in 1994 and it has seen its fair share of accidents and mechanical failures (such as alternators and fuel injectors) but it has never once left any of us stranded on the side of the road.  Despite not having air bags or any other fancy safety features (accept seat belts!), this car has kept me completely safe during several accidents, including a direct hit to the drivers door.

The car has great visibility lines (you can actually see the front and back of your car from the drivers seat) and is a breeze to maneuver.  The car as a power drivers seat, power windows, power locks, and the sound from the standard radio/speakers is acceptable (not terrible like most standard-issue radios).  I would recommend taking excellent care of the power antenna however because 1) they are terribly difficult to replace and 2) they are terribly expensive to replace.  The seats are incredibly comfortable as well � I never need to pull off to a rest area because my back is getting stiff. The back seat is large enough for passengers comfortably, but tall adults might get a bit cramped on long trips.  The trunk is big enough for just about anything you can think of that would reasonably carried in a car.  The gas mileage is also good considering it is a V6 with lots and lots of miles on it (I still get about 22-26mpg).

I live in a state with notoriously snowy/slushy/icy roads in the winter but I have never gotten my car stuck in a snow bank nor lost control of the car on icy roads.  The car has enough weight to keep it on the ground even with high winds.  The car doesn�t have too much weight that it can�t get up and go when you want it to however.  I have the larger  of the two V6 engines offered with this model (the 3.3L) and it is a loud engine.  From what I�ve learned, this particular engine has been known for being loud.  I just turn up my radio and forget about it.

The only con I could find with this car is the styling � the older body style and the rather �box-like� interior really show the age of the car.  The sad thing is I don�t think Oldsmobile changed this look until about 1997.  I guess this helps to keep the insurance down very low.  The dash sometimes rattles at higher speeds as well.  The body of my car has withstood the Minnesota winters and road salt well and is just starting to show tiny rust spots now. =( 

This would make a great first car for anyone or a family car for someone who doesn�t have a whole lot of money to spend.  This car will last you a long time if you treat it well in return.
