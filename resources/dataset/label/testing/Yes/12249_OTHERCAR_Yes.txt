            This car looks pretty good.  Its not a Porshe, but it still looks alright.  The VR4 model actually looks pretty darn good.  I noticed it because I was looking for a nice four door car.  Car and Driver gave it the best in the mid-size category under $20,000.  I decided that I would go look at it.  The interior is very nice.  It has a 7 speaker Infinity sound system in it.  The acceleration is peppy, its not amazaing, but it gets the job done.  Fairly well actually, for a family car a 0-60 under 9 seconds is pretty good.  The car handles very well.  That can be attributed to the great suspension department at Mitsubishi.  I truly enjoyed driving this car, and I would have bought it, but my mother bought a Buick Century while I was bowling.<br><br>
