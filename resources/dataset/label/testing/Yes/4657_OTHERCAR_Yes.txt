            It's been a year since I have had my '96 Chevy Cavalier and I must admit that my relationship with this car is a on-off love and hate relationship.  Hmm, what am I in love with?  I picked my car over one that sounded better with less miles because of the nice sporty look and gorgeous turquoise color.  The interior is beautiful and incredibly roomy for a small compact car.  It feels great when I drive it (which is often) and handles the road great no matter how I drive it.
I read in the consumer report that the year 1996 was not the best year to buy a Cavalier and mentions a couple of little problems with it such as the noise, lights not working properly, and other little things like that.
I must admit that different times I do find it extremely easy to hear the wind screeching outside and I just need to remind myself that it's easier to hear that in my car.  As for the lights not working properly, I don't know anything about it.
Recently, I discovered two somewhat serious leaks in my car.  One is a valve cover leak and the other one is a rear main seal leak.  I am disappointed to have found those in my car which until now has proven to be extremely dependable.  However, I was also told by mechanics that many cars do get those leaks so I don't know if I just happen to be one of the unlucky ones.  
**Update**
I just took my car in to have a recall done and found out that there was actually 4 recalls on my car.  I wouldn't have known since I only received notice for one of them.  I believe that was due to the fact that my car was bought used.  I am just relieved that they found them and serviced them.  
Another disappointment just occurred the other day...I was driving when my tape deck broke.  I don't know what happened....I turned the tape off, then I turned it back on and something malfunctioned.  One more thing to fix.....
Now, knowing all this, would I still buy this car if I had to do it all over again?  Yes, I love the way it drives and how roomy it is.  I think with any car, there are going to be ups and downs.  I love my car the way I would love a child, you take the good with the bad.<br><br>
