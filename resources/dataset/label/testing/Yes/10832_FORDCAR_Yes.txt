            I would like to comment on the Ford Windstar Van.  The ford Windstar was my second car.  I love all the extra features.  I especially like the rear air control and rear radio controls.  The Windstar handles supurbly on city roads and the highway.  My Windstar came with a CD player with a crystal clear sound.  The Ford Motor Company really prices these vans resonably too.  I got many standard features for not much money. I was envolved in an accident with a Dodge Dakota.  The special frame Ford puts in the car saved me.  The frame broke under the impact and I sustained minimal damages.  My Ford has never given me any trouble.  However the mechanics at the Ford shop have.  I have had to reapetitly go back because of bubbles that were in the paint.  The steering wheel was off center when I first recieved my van.  Other than these minor problems I have never had a complaint about my van.  The Ford Windstar is really a great vehicle!<br><br>
