            I've had my 2000 LeSabre Custom since March of 1999. Presently I have 35,000 miles on the car. 

The seats and the drivers fit is the best of any car I've had. I can honestly say I no longer have back aches from driving. The comfort level is great. 

This engine is very responsive and good in traffic. 

Their are several things that could be better. The transmission hits to hard when you but it in gear, the computer is to sensitive about the tire pressure and engine coolant. This is good to warn you of a problem, but it seems to warn when there isn't one, leaving you to worry about the problem until you can get it checked. The brakes get hard in the pedal when driving in rain or wet roads.

The gas mileage is good, 25 to 30 mpg. It's a good car for the businessman who wants a reliable, economical and professional vehicle to work in.<br><br>
