            Toyota has undoubtedly hit the jackpot with this recently redesigned species of Corolla.  It's body design can be easily likened to Toyota's Camry- the number one selling car in America.  Corolla is the perfect car for any person who doesn't feel quite comfortable handling a full size automobile.  When driving it, you'll feel like the car is even smaller than it actually is.  It's managability is a true assett of the car.  For drivers like myself, Corolla makes some things (such as parallel parking) seem ridiculously easy, because of its size.  One should keep in mind that Corolla is a little bit more expensive than Civic, but the money is definitely worth it.  My parents have leased 7 Toyotas over the past 8 years, and have almost never had any problems with all of them.  Happy Driving!<br><br>
