            <i><b>This review is being updated after approximately 9 months of driving my RAV4.</b></i>  Now that I have had time to fully acquaint myself with my new vehicle, and enjoy it, I'd like to share some information at the 15,000 mile point.

I saw the CUTEST &quot;baby jeep&quot; sitting on the dealer lot!  Being rather petite, purchasing a vehicle to fit my small frame and short legs was usually a chore. And I have to admit, I have always been more concerned with fit than style.  But this was it!  Just my size!  And unlike anything I'd ever owned!

I excitedly took my husband to see.  He frowned and said &quot;That not a Jeep - it's a Toyota!&quot;  (As if I cared?)

Nothing much more was said.  Then a few days before my 48th birthday, I decided to visit the dealer on my lunch hour, just to drive it. And drive it I did - I ended up driving it home!  Now, wasn't my husband surprised!  So were my co-workers, who exclaimed that they didn't normally see someone my age, in my usual business suit attire, climb out of a shiny little SUV.  And my teen daughter's comment?  &quot;Oh, Mom, don't worry about it - it will probably be the last car you ever buy.&quot;  (What !?!?)

Well, I still love it, and have chalked this one up to giving myself the luxury of a little mid-life crisis enjoyment!

I think this vehicle is perfect for people who don't need a full-size jeep or van, yet want the style, convenience and roominess that it offers.  I feel safe in it, but I consider myself a conservative driver.  I probably would not put a teen on the road in it unless they were a very mature driver.

These are some of the things I have encountered:

<b>Gas Mileage</b>  Not too bad.  On the highway, it averages around 29 mpg.  In town, about 24.5 mpg.  With a manual 5-speed transmission, I was expecting a little more, but my husband claims this is reasonable.

<b>Ride</b>  It's not the smoothie that my Olds was; but I think it's surprisingly nice for a small SUV.

<b>Trips to the Shop</b>  Zero.  Absolutely none, outside of my regular oil changes and maintenance.  Not even (knock on wood) a flat tire so far.

<b>Comfort</b>  I can drive for long stretches of time with no problem.  For safety's sake, I do get out for a breath of fresh air periodically.  But it is not because I am uncomfortable with the seats or the ride.

<b>Adverse Road Conditions</b>  It has hydro-planed some on roads during heavy rains.  I am aware and try to be careful and slow down in these situations. 

<b>Roominess</b>  As for hauling things, I love the wide rear door and room behind the seats.  Plus the seats can be folded up for a spacious covered area for hauling just about anything!

<b>Rattles and Squeaks</b>  Very few.  None that have lasted.

<b>Wipers</b>  This may seem like a small issue, but I do wish it had variable speed wipers rather than 3 speeds.  And that's about the only thing I can think of that I would change!!

So in conclusion, I highly recommend the Toyota RAV4 as economical, handy and just plain fun!

PS.  My husband, by the way, looks forward to the rare occasions that I let HIM drive it!
