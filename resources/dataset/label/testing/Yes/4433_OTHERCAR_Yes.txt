            I take pleasure in writing about Mazda B-series pickups. I am driving my second one and have decided that I will NOT buy any other brand. My first Mazda was a cab plus but this one is cab plus-4 door! A dream for men or women, even though women get blamed for carrying more &quot;stuff&quot; (guess what gender I am!). The storage (and fold down seats) is such a great option. I have had pickups in the past of the following brands: 2 Dodges and 1 Chevrolet. NEITHER brand can compare with the reliability, durability, etc. to the Mazda. I get so many compliments on the Mazda look. Gas mileage is at 26 highway, 24 in town per gallon. I could not be happier. My satisfaction with Mazda has generated some sales among friends. See what you think. I don't think you'll be disappointed!<br><br>
