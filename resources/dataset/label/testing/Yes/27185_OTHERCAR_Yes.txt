            We researched a new SUV for 6 months and won't bother with the mechanical comparisons etc because we all have specific needs and this vehicle after a year of ownership has more than exceeded that need.
Our local Toyota dealership was accommodating allowing us to test drive several 2002's in snow etc and allowed us to keep it over weekends hauling a group of skiers through New Yorks winter snow. (If your paying this much for a vehicle you should drive it for at least one weekend).
The handling, power, skid control and turning circle for a truck this size is amazing, particularly the skid control, as it 'clicked' in alot because of the winter terrain we travel.

My wife is 98lbs 4'11" and found it overwhelming at first but now loves the truck and feels very safe in it. I had a remote start installed for her and I am contemplating a backup warning device because she feels she can't see behind her when backing up.

She found the 4Runner, BMW 5, Lexus RX300 and Acura MDX too small for our family needs. My son and I were sold on the 2003 4Runner Limited but were reminded it was too small.

We honestly tried GMC & FORD products as well but they are not in the same league re: quality and their massive depreciation is tough to swallow.

Only problem so far: the defrost heating controls became erratic at 17,000 miles but were repaired by the dealership no other problems. Our dealership, although they didn't get the sale, have been a pleasure to deal with.

However, after driving the 2002 and going back and forth with a dealership that would not budge on their prices I was able to purchase a used 2003 Limited (4,000 miles on it) for the same price as their demo 2002 SR5 (6000miles)and it came with the 100,000 mile 7 yr Platinum Toyota extended warranty. All I had to do was drive 7 hours to pick it up and that was an adventure.

As a large family we enjoy our SUV and the only gripe the women have is the middle row of seats are difficult to fold for smaller people. As is getting in & out of it because of its height from the pavement.
