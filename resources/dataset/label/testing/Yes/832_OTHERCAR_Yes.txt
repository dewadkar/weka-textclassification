            I *love* my camera!!! I don't leave home without it (and extra batteries!!!). Photography is one of my hobbies and I use it for work as well. The nice thing about a digital camera is that you preview the pix right away and if it isn't what you want, delete and shoot again! :) I did a lot of research prior to my purchace and this was the best I found in my price range. The selling feature for me was that it comes with a 16mb card instead of the standard 9mb card. I can get 29 full size, super quality shots, or 100+ 'medium' quality (still very good) 1/4 size shots. It has fun features like B&W & Sepia, for that old time look and a little remote so *you* can be in the picture as well. There is a button on it, Jet Send, so if you had an HP printer (I don't) you *could* send the pix right to the printer and another button that allows you to record sound bits to go with your image. COOL!!! It comes with a great software package, enabling you to easily view, organize, e-mail, edit, and upload to HP's online photo album website www.cartogra.com The camera itself has 'substance' when you hold it, compared to a lot of the lower priced cameras that feel like a toy. Go to an appliance store and pick them up to see what I mean. :) The kid at the store tried to talk me out of it, saying HP was so new to cameras, but HP teamed up with Pentax on the lens. It has a great zoom, as well as an additional digital zoom. 

Problems
It eats batteries very fast. I don't bother buying 'regular' strength batteries, I have to buy the 'titaneum' and still, I go through them like water. The shutter isn't as fast as a traditional film camera, making it hard to quickly snap suprise pix, say like when my boyfriend is goofing off with the dog. By the time the camera takes the shot, he stops. I also had a problem taking pix of Josh on his dirtbike. By the time the camera took the shot, he was over the jump and I got a pix of nothing! LOL!! (cure: snap shutter BEFORE he gets to the jump. Perfect!) Also, there is a pause between shots, creating a problm while trying to get some great shots of my dog. (I believe there is a feature to do multi shots, but I don't know how to do that yet.)  

This truly is a great camera! Team it up with a good quality photo printer and become your family's photographer of choice!!!
