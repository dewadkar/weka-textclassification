            As I said, the reviewing saga continues.......... 

What!? The sentence above doesn't make any sense to you? If this is your first time reading one of my automotive reviews, I can understand your confusion.  I have two other car reviews, one regarding a 1986 Maxima and another on a 1987 200SX  SE-V6.  If you like either one of these cars, would just like to review the saga in it's entirety, or maybe even enjoyed this review after reading it, perhaps you will want to check out the other two reviews. (hint hint *grin*) If not, I will understand ( *pout* j/k) and here's a recap of the other two cars.  

The 86 Maxima is a good car, has good speed, and is very reliable, but it is a four-door sedan and I am not as keen on sedans as some people.  That led me to buy the 87 200SX SE-V6.  Even though this car is more my speed, so the speak, a few trips in the snow with this car can cause a few gray hairs.  After getting stuck once too often in the white stuff, I decided that it was time to go back to a four-wheel-drive pickup.  

Once again, my father eventually comes through as he has in so many of my other vehicles.  He has a buddy who had a 1990 4X4 Nissan Hardbody King Cab pickup that he wanted to sell. This truck had some minor hail damage, but given all of the other factors it was in very good condition.  It was also an interesting way of coming around full circle, because the truck I had to let go before I bought my Maxima was a 1988 four-wheel-drive Nissan King Cab  pickup that I had bought in 1988.  The major difference between the two trucks was the price.  Needless to say, buying this 1990 pickup in the year 1997 was much cheaper than buying the 88 pickup in 1988.  At any rate, I test drove the truck, make sure that it was suitable for my needs, and traded my beloved 200SX  in for the pickup.  Since most of you probably don't do much horse trading with your dads, I roughly paid a little under $6,000 for my truck, if I would've pay for it outright.  

As I mentioned in the above paragraph, both my 1988 pickup and my 1990 pickup are quite similar.  In fact, I think Nissan had kept this style of pickup from 1986 to around 1998.  As for the style of the pickup, if you like that sleeker looks you might find in the newer Ford F150s, or the clean lines you will find on the Toyota pickups, this is probably not the truck that is going to catch your attention.  The Nissan's front end is extremely flat and boxy, giving it that the look of a prize fighter after going 15 rounds with Mike Tyson.  To put it bluntly at first I thought it was butt ugly, but I didn't really buy it for its pretty boy looks and if you're like me eventually it grows on you.  

One of the things I did buy it for was its feel on the road.  These trucks handle corners quite well, without giving any indication of tipping over during high-speed emergency maneuvers thanks to Nissan's torsion bar front suspension.  Also, call me a bit biased, but my 1990 pickup, even with it's SE and power package (which includes the bigger tires and stiffer suspension as well as a sun roof, digital cassette stereo, power mirrors, power door locks and power windows) gave a nice comfortable ride, as long as you were sitting in the front two seats.  The flip down back seats however, are another story.  The two back seats are suitable enough for a couple of kids driving a short distance, but sticking an adult back there is equivalent to a macabre contortion torture test.  I know firsthand, for my father had one of the first of these trucks, and I had been tortured a few times in my day, but that's another story.  

 There is one thing that I have to gripe about in this truck, is the fact that Nissan used the same V6 engine in their '80s Z cars, the mid 80's Maxima, the rare 87-88 200SX SE-V6 as well as their Hardbody pickup.  Although this engine works well in the cars, the trucks are heavier so even though they upped the torque in the truck derivative of this engine, Nissan did not up the horsepower enough.  The result, is the truck can run a bit slow at times.  Of course, I'm a sports car/muscle car nut, so again my opinion is a bit biased.  

Like I had mentioned before, the main reason why I buy pickups is for their four-wheel-drive capabilities.  The one thing I love about the Nissan pickups is that they perform well in the snow.  The SE version of the Hardbody comes with automatic locking hubs, so all you have to do is pull the handle on the floor from two wheel drive (2H) to four wheel drive (4H) and the front hubs will automatically lock in.  You can do this while stationary, or while moving, but you can't be going too fast a.k.a. highway speeds  when you do.  When you get to your destination, or when the snow finally melts, all you need to do is shift back into two wheel drive mode once again, put the truck in reverse, and drive back around 10 ft. and that will disengage the front hubs.  This is a great option for the ladies, or for guys like me that don't like getting out into the elements to play with their front hubs.  Also,  Nissan was the first import company to put the wider and bigger rims and tires on their trucks, giving them a higher ground clearance to get through the mud and snow better.  Although this made it quite nice in the snow and off-road maneuvers it contributed to the sluggish factor I had mentioned before.  

In conclusion, the 1990 4x4 Nissan Hardbody Pickup is a good buy.  They're reliable, dependable and very good work trucks that if treated well will last for years.  I had mine for more than three years without any incident or major repair.  

Yes, you did read right; I did say " had ".  It is a long story but the short of it is that for once the speed factor legitimately came into play and as a result I do not have my pickup anymore.  What I do have may surprise you, and then again it may not.......

 You will have to just keep coming back to my reviews to find out which car that is........... *smile*
