I recently purchased my first car, a 1994 SE Pontiac Grand Prix. Of course, any startup car will be great the first couple of months, but after that, I starting looking at it, and realized that it wasn't that great after all. 

The major problem I have with the car is its BRAKES. Realizing that the brakes are bad to begin with (on this model) I've come to accept that the ABS system is not dependable, and more often than not they simply won't work in winter time. Compared to other cars/trucks, the best word I can use to describe them is &quot;sluggish.&quot;

Another problem is the interior. It's basic...that's about it. Not a whole lot of space to put stuff on or in. It seems like someone just put something together on a weekend without taking the time to really study what works and what doesn't. 

Not all of it is bad, however. The engine/acceleration is good, along with roomy trunk and headlights. And I as stated, it is a good startup car for a teen or someone that has not driven before. As far as anybody else, I would encourage them to get a later model.<br><br>
