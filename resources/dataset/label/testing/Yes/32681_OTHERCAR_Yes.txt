            My grandparents buy a new Lincoln Town Car every two years.  This tradition with them has been going on for nearly 13 years.  Last year I had to ride with my Gramps to pick up the Lincoln from the dealership since it was being serviced.  I just assumed I would drive his truck back, but no...I had to drive the BOAT.  To me the Lincoln Town cars are considered boats or tankers in my mind.  I am used to driving sports cars or mid size luxury vehicles.  I was not happy by being conned into driving this pearly, white automobile.  I was actually embarrassed to be seen driving it!  But I survived.  I do have to give Lincoln credit about how SMOOTH the ride is.

When my Granny and I go shopping I always want to take her vehicle primarily so she can drive, but it is comfortable and safe.  Yes, I said I feel it is a tank, but I feel secure when I ride in it.  I feel if we get in an accident the chances are decreased since the automobile is so huge.  Honestly, you can't feel a bump in the road, and here in Arkansas that is a miracle since we have the worst roads anywhere.  The sound system is also pretty good.  I really like the temperature control options and how it shows you what the temperature is outside.  The Lincoln's are also known for how roomy they are and that is nice not to be cramped in a vehicle!  I suggest this car if this car fits your lifestyle and you are looking for comfort and luxury rolled into one.  I personally would never own anything this big, but that is just me...Maybe when I get older I might opt for a larger car, but until then I will stick to smaller ones and suv's.<br><br>
