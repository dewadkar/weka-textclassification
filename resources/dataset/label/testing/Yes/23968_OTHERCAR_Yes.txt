            My 93 Corrado SLC has been a daily driver since I purchased it used in '95 (The original owner leased it for 1 year). Additionally, I've owned & driven my fair share of VWs (Beetles, Rabbits, Sciroccos, Foxes, Jettas, Passats and Golfs) so I feel I am qualified to pass on my experiences with this car.  

First of all, this is not your Father's Volkswagen.  SLC stands for Sport Luxury Coupe and that is exactly what VW accomplished with this car. In many ways it was ahead of its time and is a match for much of today's competition. Its V6 engine puts out 178 HP and 173 lbs of torque.  To give you an idea of what's rolling along on the road these days, a 2001 Acura Integra GSR (the higher powered sport version) makes 170 hp and 128 lbs. of torque and costs over 22k in comparison.  Unlike the Integra however, the Corrado is an uncommon car, and with its clean sporty looks, many people ask what it is and mistake it for a new model. When they learn it is a VW they are usually shocked that it is a 6 cylinder and will do 135+ mph with only a upgraded chip. Features include such things as power windows & locks, cruise control, anti-theft alarm, ABS, a Multi-Function button that gives readouts of MPG, oil temp, outside temp, average speed, and elapsed trip time, power sunroof, electronic speed activated spoiler (a la Porsche) as well as volt and oil pressure gauges. The interior has proven itself durable and tasteful, and you have a choice of good quality leather or the more practical and comfortable fabric. Many reviewers say they prefer the Corrado's VR6 engine to the newer VW 4 cylinder turbo engines due to its more flexible power and raw "grunt". 

The car is low slung, and less nimble people may need to take their time getting into it, but once inside the seats are comfortable and supportive, even over long trips. The auto retracting shoulder belts you encounter are harmless and were mandatory for all 93 cars in the US without airbags. The belts and the built in anti-theft alarm entitle you to discounts on your car insurance by the way.  Gauges and controls are easy to read and operate, but locking the driver door requires you to reach behind your left shoulder if you are in the drivers seat.  Once underway the car pulls strongly and smoothly, as the VR6 engine is well known for its excellent torque. The car is very stable and reasonably quiet while cruising at highway speeds. Road feel is excellent, typical of German cars and the front wheel drive is predictable to handle. It is best suited for cruising and long curvy stretches of highway. Stop and go heavy city traffic on rough roads is not its forte, for these conditions you'd best drive some pliant softly sprung car with an automatic. This car is a Drivers Car, best enjoyed by driving enthusiasts, not those needing just a seat to sit in while getting from A to B and then leave on the street and forget.

Following scheduled maintenance and filter & fluid changes is a must with this car and will help ensure years of reliable running. Adding an aftermarket oil cooler is a good idea for hotter climates.  There are some factory recalls that should have been fixed on most Corrados by now - new auxiliary fan, sticking sunroof, new heater core and new fuel line clamps. Most other problems result from inattention from prior owners or just normal wear and tear as the miles add up. The VR6 is a sturdy engine and like most V6s will still be running strong long after a more highly stressed 4 cylinder is ready to bite the dust.

The Corrado is a respected and sought after hobby car in import car enthusiast circles. A wide range of upgrades to power and handling such as chips, cams, superchargers etc are available all of which greatly increase the performance and driving enjoyment of the vehicle.  Reliable setups putting out over 230hp and 225 torque are available and make for a truly powerful road machine when you consider the weight of this car is only 2800 lbs.

I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a fast German sports coupe at a reasonable price who can afford to pay a little attention to upkeep and maintenance.
