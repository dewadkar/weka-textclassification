            A few years ago, I had given up all hope that an affordable car would ever be something worthwhile. But, then there came the VW Beetle and now the Chrysler PT Cruiser. In many respects, the Cruiser is almost the perfect car: it's relatively cheap, it's economical, it's eminently practical, it's looks great and it's a blast to drive. Or course, like the Beetle, it's now being made in Mexico, but I can overlook that given all it has to offer. In fact, the only real downside of the Cruiser, like a high school crush, is it's unavailable! If you want one, be endowed with patience and get ready to be gouged.

Yes, DaimlerChrysler made a HUGE mistake in underestimating the demand for the PT Cruiser. How could D/C not have known that such a knockout combination of looks, personality and character would be a worldbeater. Instead, they decided to focus production on those lumbering sedans they make that no one seems to want. Go figure!

The Cruiser is loosely based on the second-generation Dodge Neon chassis and has 150 horses galloping under its bulbous hood. That may not seem like much in today�s market, the given the PT's relatively light weight, it's actually quite adequate with passengers on board and quite lively if you're all by your lonesome and you've got the 5-speed tranny with the retro white orb on top. Since the PT is really just a tall station wagon in hot rod drag, there is ample room for 4 95th percentile occupants with a 5th thrown in for a pinch. Much has been made about all the different ways to configure the interior, but, regardless, it just swallows up stuff, especially with the back seat removed.  And, taking the seat out is so easy.

The exterior styling speaks for itself. But, I happen to love it because it breaks the mold and looks like nothing else out there, except for Chrysler's beloved 1941 Panel Van. What really made an impression on me, though, was the intelligence and quality of the interior design, and fittings, given the PT's intended price range.  I am quite cognizant that MSRP does not apply when talking about the Cruiser, but, if and when Cruiser's can be had for that price, the interior, especially the leather seat with suede inserts, is a standout.  The plastic panels on the dash that match the exterior paint really give the interior a decided flair.  Although plastic abounds, it is quality plastic and it is clear that whoever designed the PT�s interior held aesthetics in high regard. Everything just seems right. Feng Sui I suppose. It has a solid &quot;go ahead and beat me up&quot; feel about it. And, ergonomically, everything falls readily to hand, except the electric window lifts, which are mounted on the center console instead of their usual place on the doors.

Chrysler products have never been known for their reliability, so, for now, I am holding off on getting a Cruiser until I see how well they hold up in the real world. I need a vehicle that will go for at least 150,000 miles reliably since I have to drive to Court all the time. So, for now, it's me and my Camry. But, should the Cruiser ever become readily available for anywhere near the MSRP......
