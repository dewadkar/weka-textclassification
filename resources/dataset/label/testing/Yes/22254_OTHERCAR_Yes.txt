<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>Could live in seats<br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>Wonderful performance and handling. The car hugs the road very well and feels VERY stable. I feel very safe driving this car. The acceleration is terrific. <br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>The #1 reason I bought this car was because of its safety features.
At the time of my purchase it was definitely one of the safest cars to drive on the road.<br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>My wife was the person in our family who drove our 97 Volvo 850GLT station wagon, and we were both very happy with it. In fact it was a car I had always wanted - I know this may sound silly but it was at one time my dream car. I had absolutely no intention of selling our 97 850 GLT wagon because I was very happy with it. My other car is a 95 Volvo 850 GLT sedan which is just OK. <br>

I test drove the 2001 V70 T5 while I took my 95 850GLT to the dealership for some minor repairs. I like to test drive new cars just for the fun of it and so I thought I'd try out the latest Volvo...it blew me away!
I could not believe how much better the new V70 T5 was. It was not just a little better, it was far better in every area!
I especially loved: the acceleration, how well it gripped the road, the incredible stability, the awesome brakes, the fantastic front seats, the new amenities, the new safety features, and the better sound system.
The feature that was the clincher for me was the front AND rear side window air bags/curtain. I really wanted this extra protection for my wife and children and I was willing to pay a premium for it.  

I went home and brought my wife back a few days later (after all she's the one who drives the family wagon with our 6 &amp; 9 year old). She loved it too. The salesman who served us was mediocre at best - the car sold itself to us.  We were both sold and bought one of the very first 2001 V70 T5's sold in the San Francisco bay area. Because of this we could not get a good price for it, but I was willing to pay the premium price because it would be the car that would drive around the most important people in my life. 

Prior to test driving the V70 T5 I had test driven a BMW 540i a few days earlier which made my beloved 97 850GLT wagon feel on the &quot;skinny&quot; side.
I think the handling and performance of the V70 T5 comes very close to the BMW540i - what a treat!

We bought our car in May 2000 and sold our 97 850GLT wagon. It is now August 18, 2000 and we have had no problems at all with it(not that I expected any).  After driving it for over 3 months, I can say that I have no regrets and am very glad I bought it. The &quot;manumatic&quot; transmission system is wonderful. When driving it, I often think to myself &quot;what a perfect car this is!&quot;  It was worth every penny I paid for.

The only design issues I didn't like are:
1. The cup holders next to the hand brake do not have covers.
2. The storage compartment between the two front seats is only partially covered and therefore I can't hide anything there. (Maybe they don't have car thieves in Sweden).
3. The rear exhaust pipe points down instead of pointing to the rear. I don't think it looks very good. 

Other than the above 3 items, this car is as perfect as it gets. 
My only regret is that for my daily driving I have to drive the 95 850GLT which does not hold a candle to the V70 T5.

*****UPDATE OCTOBER 10, 2000*****
After owning this car for 5 months now I am still as enthusiastic as ever about it. The only problem I have had so far was a thunk noise that I would hear once in a while under the car. I called the dealer and they took it in (And gave me a 2000 V70 XC as a loaner - which is definitely an inferior car compared to the 2001 V70T5) and repaired it - the thunk noise is gone. The car runs very smoothly and is wonderful to drive.

I am currently in the market to replace my 95 850GLT sedan. I am comparing all the cars that I test drive with my V70T5. Boy has the V70T5 spoiled me. I am looking for a car that feels as good as the V70T5.
There are only a few cars that I am considering:

2001 Lexus GS300 - I crossed this off my list because it does not handle as well as the V70T5 and is missing the safety features.

2001 BMW 528 - I crossed this off my list because it is such a heavy car - it feels like I am driving a heavily loaded car even though it is completely empty. The acceleration also was inferior to the V70T5.

2001 Mercedes 320C - This is my top choice so far. It is a beautiful car!
According to the literature it goes 0-60 in 6.9 seconds which is fast enough for me. My complaints are that it is on the small side and the seats are not as comfortable as the Volvo - it seems no one has seats as good as Volvo.

2001 S60 T5 - I am waiting for this to come out at the end of this month. I hope it impresses me enough to chose it over the Mercedes 320C.

******** OCTOBER 22 UPDATE *************
I finally found something that could be a significant shortcoming for some people: I think the front center console is too wide on the front passenger's side and because of this the leg room for the front passenger is limited. It is not as spacious as the 1997 850 station wagon that I previously owned. I carried a passenger this past week who was about 6'1&quot; and around 230 lbs and that person looked cramped and uncomfortable in the front passenger seat. In the rear seat that person was fine.
I think this is a design flaw because it looks to me like Volvo could have made the front center console just an inch or two narrower.
