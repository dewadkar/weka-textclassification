            I want to start by saying, "I LOVE THIS CAMERA". It takes great photos, it's easy to operate in it's fully automatic mode, and if you want to get real serious about photography this camera will allow you to spread your wings. 

First, every photographer (amateur or professional) wants sharp pictures...as do I. This camera gives the sharpest pictures I've seen out of a digital camera; it even rivals my old 35mm from Minolta. Each picture I've taken (with exception to when I'm moving around too much) has turned out sharp at each resolution (explained later). 

Second this camera is very easy to operate in it's fully automatic mode. Turn the camera on, it auto-focuses, you press the trigger partway, it'll lock the focus, press the rest of the way and it takes the picture. If it's too dark it'll flash a little light telling you to pop up the flash, and it'll take the picture. If you want you can leave the flash up all the time, and it'll only use it when it needs. 

As an amateur camera it's great, and easy, but we all like to get fancy and try new things. Needless to say, this camera has more bells and buzzers (when you want them) than you can count on your fingers and toes combined. You can control the aperture (for more depth of field-more sharpness between subjects), you can control the speed of the camera (good for taking sports pics), or you can let loose and control both AND manual focusing. 

There are a lot more function (too many to list here), but there are a few I'll list: 
High speed mode (sports) 
*Video capture (40 seconds of motion video-no sound though) 
*BestShot (takes a sequence of pictures and lets you choose which is best) 
*6 "size" modes (Full 2048x1536 , UXGA 1600x1200 , SXGA 1280x960 , XGA 1024x768 , VGA 
 640x480 , and 3:2 2048x1360 (this emulates the 35mm spec)) 
*4 modes of compression (HI,Fine,Normal,Basic) these are important for when you want to edit and enlarge the pictures...Hi will allow you to enlarge REAL BIG. 


Well, I think I've listed some of the important stuff....if you want more info on this camera check out Nikon's homepage, they have a lot of add-ons to the camera that are well worth the look (lens,filters,addition batteries) 

This camera comes with everything you need to get started: Rechargeable Battery, charger, 16MB Compact Flashcard (will hold about 200+ basic low res pics, or about 13 Hi-qual SUPER sized pics) 

HAVE FUN :)
