            I have a 1994 model GMC 1/2 T Ext. cab short bed.....130,000 miles. It has never been in the shop. I use it to haul hay and pull my horse trailer. Today it is still the most dependable, most comfortable vehicle on the road. I had a Chevrolet pick-up before this one and put 107,000 miles on it before selling it to a friend and he has it to this day.....no telling how many miles he has put on it. General Motors is certainly doing something right. 
  
My father is an avid Ford man and has even done some commercials for Ford. I believe I have him convinced to get a GMC for his nexxt pick-up. He hasn't been very happy with his Fords lately and he sees the success I have been having with General Motors. 

I am sold on General motors pick-ups.<br><br>
