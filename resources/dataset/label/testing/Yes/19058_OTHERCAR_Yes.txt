            The digital market has exploded in the last couple of years, but until recently the quality of the offerings have been substandard to say the least.  But that is no longer the case. There are many fine cameras out there. But as a motion picture cameraman I have become spoiled by lenses that cost 18-20k a piece and cameras upwards of 1 million dollars. These machines produce image of incredible quality. But are out of reach for 99 percent of the world (myself included.) It was with this background I went out and bought my first digital camera. I knew it had to 2.1 megapixels because I was going to do 8x10s. That was the easy part, it also needed to have a great lens that narrowed the choice down to three of four (Nikon,Sony,Olympus, and Canon) I wrote a detailed breakdown of the four cameras for this review but I will boil down to this: Sony had no viewfinder. The Nikon has weird ergonomics . The Canon uses non-standard (read expensive) batteries. That  left the C2020. The lens is great fast with low distortion by dint of its aspheric glass. The camera is compact and feels great in my hands the optical viewfinder is clear and easy to use. The LCD hardly gets turned on but  when it does it is beautiful. Speaking of beautiful, the images are stunning. As a pro I can nitpick about this anti-aliasing or that interpolation, but the reality is that this camera will take breathtaking pictures without you having to understand every feature and sub-system on the camera. It is very simple to use and yet offers a great deal of control for the person that wants to manipulate the exposure. My only complaint is the lens cap is not very elegant and you have to remove it before the camera is turned on or the lens pushes it off onto the floor. But other than that, I keep the camera with all the time and after 8 months I still am thrilled when I use it.<br><br>
