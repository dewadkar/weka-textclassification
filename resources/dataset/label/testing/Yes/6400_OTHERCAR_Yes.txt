            Hoping for an Aurora, but unwilling to pay the price, I leased an Intrigue by Oldsmobile, back in March of 1999. I picked out a dark green, fully loaded GLS, which now shows 25,000 miles. Here are some impressions of the ride so far.

Driving more than 40,000 miles per year, I appreciate a car that remains comfortable, even 5 hours into a journey. The Intrigue is no slouch in this department, at least for the front seat passengers. The back seat folks fare a little worse, as the rear area is poorly proportioned. The back seat also suffers from poor airflow, making for some hot summertime passengers, even with the front passengers being iced in their seats.
Some of the interior design elements are just plain annoying, especially the wiper arm which is mounted on the right side of the steering column. Nothing should be mounted here; save for the gear selector in an automatic transmission equipped car. Anyone that has used my car grabs this stalk upon start off, as if they are putting the car in gear. Eventually it will be broken off. If you're a smoker, forget about the Intrigue. Ostensibly it seems like the perfect smoker's car; a moon roof to extract the smoke, a built-in air filtration system to cleanse the remaining fumes, leather seats that resist absorbing smells. But, then there is the ashtray. Rather than the lighted, drawer style version that Oldsmobile used to favor, the Intrigue offers an 'afterthought' smoker's kit. This kit features a plastic-lidded cup that wouldn't be out of place in a child's sandbox. It is designed to fit into one of the console's cup holders. It is not lighted, difficult to find in the dark and it's a reach to 'ash' into it. The lighter is hidden from view, behind a flimsy little door. On the positive side of the interior, there are many handy compartments, including one for a cell phone, built into the dash area left of the steering column. The overall dash-into-door interior scheme, with a two-tone effect, is well planned and attractive. 


The overall fit and finish of the car is tight and great, inside and out. Gone are the mismatched trim pieces and sloppy gingerbread that haunted earlier GM products.
 
The styling, now that I've gotten used to it, is a love/hate affair. They say that a 'camel is a horse designed by a committee', and anyone with knowledge of GM knows their love affair with committees. I say this because the styling of this car was clearly committee-driven; the cool yuppie committee designed the front half, the doughty curmudgeon committee designed the rest. Clearly, they don't belong to the same car. Everything forward of the windshield smacks of its Aurora sibling, while everything after the B pillar seems uninspired, both inside and out.
Drive-train wise, the Intrigue shows off its Aurora heritage nicely. The 3.5 Liter engine is a real screamer, making for delightful, confident passing power.

The upshot of my first 25,000 miles is this; I got a 'baby Aurora' for a lot less money, and only had to give up a few things in the process. Overall I'm pleased with the car and have come to terms with the few gripes I have about it.
