            A Nissan pickup truck was my very first automobile.  I got it just before my senior year of high school.  I was somewhat embarrassed at driving a truck, but my incredibly safety-conscious father was insistent that there be &quot;lots of metal&quot; around my body.  
For the 3 years I drove this truck, I was not particularly concerned with its safety features.  However, it did suit my purposes, got me to school, and even did nicely on the drive out to college from California to Chicago.  It was surprisingly easy to drive in the snow during Chicago winters and, with 2 jump seats in the back, even made it possible to drive friends around occasionally.
The real success of this truck though WAS its safety.  I was in a 3-car freeway pileup accident (where I was the only driver NOT faulted for the accident), and my truck and I were the middle vehicle.  We were all going approximately 60 miles per hour when this accident occurred.  I was crushed between 2 cars - front and back.  The engine block was destroyed as the front of the truck was crushed inward.  The front bumper of the car behind me ended up pushing my truck's bumper 3 feet forward and under.  In the cab, I was understandably shaken and had a little whiplash, but I walked away from the accident completely healthy and undamaged.  Nissan performed beautifully in this real-life crash test and my survival is a testament to that fact.  I'm sure that, had I driven a small car instead, I would have had quite serious injuries.  I will never question the importance of safety in a car purchase again!<br><br>
