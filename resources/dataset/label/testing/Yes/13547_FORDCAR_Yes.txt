            I must admit that, being a first time SUV owner, I was a little worried about how driving an SUV would feel.  I worried for nothing.  The Ford Explorer drives almost exactly like a car.  The only difference being that in a tight corner, I feel slightly more lateral push... although this could be my imagination since I've only had the thing for a few months, and there is a little getting used to sitting up so high.

I haven't gotten an opportunity to try out the four wheel drive feature as of yet, other than a little bit of playing around in the mud, but what little I've done seems to be rock-solid.  I can't wait for a chance to play around with it in some &quot;real&quot; snow.

The 4.0 liter six cylinder SOHC V6 engine seems to be powerful enough for the Explorer.  I don't have any problems with acceleration even when getting on the highway from a complete stop.

The seats in the Explorer are extremely comfortable.  I do a lot of long distance driving, and I've been able to drive for about 7 hours without a need to stop to stretch my legs.  I haven't been able to do that with any other vehicle.  

The only real downside to the Explorer is the same thing that would be a downside for any SUV, gas mileage.  I seem to be getting around 17-18 mpg with mixed driving.  On highway-only driving I am getting right around 19.5-20 mpg.  While this isn't terrible, it's a lot less than you can get with some cars.

On the downside/upside, there have been a few recalls made on the vehicle.  The downside part of this is that there were problems with it coming out of the gate, but the upside is that Ford realizes they are there, and has fixes for them.  The recalls that I've seen have been relatively minor, a secondary hood latch and a speed control cable for the cruise control.

I've had to take my vehicle in once for service in the two months I've had it, this is probably not a normal occurrence, since mine was a demo that already had 5000 miles on it, and who knows how many drivers.  The trip to the mechanic was for a bad harness in the side impact air bag, and a squeaky front wheel which required a new outer seal.

From some of the reviews that I've read, the road clearance of this car isn't as high as some of the other SUVs, and I would say that for this reason, if you're planning on doing a lot of heavy offroad driving, that you probably want to look elsewhere for an SUV, but for everyone else, I would definitely suggest that you take a good look at the Explorer.  It's a wonderful all-around vehicle.<br><br>
