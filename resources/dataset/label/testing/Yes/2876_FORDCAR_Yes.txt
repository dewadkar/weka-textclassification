            I had a 93 Escort up until today!!!  I was in a very horrible accident today and my Escort saved my life.  I called her Suzie.  She was white and had attitude.  Now she has gone to the salvage yard in the sky.  A larger vehicle hit me and the interior of the car held up wonderfully.  Both cars were totaled.. I will be buying another Escort to replace my old one.  I had her 7 years and the only thing I ever did to her was scheduled oil changes and such.  The mass air flow sensory went out one time and had to replace, that it was $79.00.  That was the only repair in 7 years.  I will miss her!!!!!!<br><br>
