            How many people have the 733i BMW. MAny do but it is not noticed by many people because of its ugly design. Don't be fooled by its outward appearance though. The 733 is one powerful machine. Although it is a 1984 model it comes with a computer dashboard which looks like a phone. In the trunk there is an emergency tool kit. Theres even a speaker in the trunk...and this was built in 1984. My goodness...this car ceases to amaze. HOwever there are many minor downers. The freaking car has no CUP HOLDERS! NO cup holders? Come on BMW...I think people drank out of cups back then too . What else...the car seems to have a major stink. mine passed the smog check but it lets out the worst smelling odor from the exhaust. Other than that...I just wanted to express my opinion about the 733i BMW.<br><br>
