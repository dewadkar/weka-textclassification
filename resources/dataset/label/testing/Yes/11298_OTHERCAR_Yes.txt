            This is a beautifully designed car. Well rounded features outside and also inside. The exterior gives the impression of a super sporty road grabbing demon, and the interior that of a velvet clad princess. The ease of use interior wise is a plus in this car. The fact that the seats in the rear can fold flat is not a new innovation, but a very useful one at that.

The power is not bad for a small litre 4 cyl engine and especially for the extra weight of a wagon. The extra options are desired such as the 6 disc CD changer, ABS braking system and sunroof. For a base price of around $16,000 and an optioned out price of roughly $18,000, this is a perfect deal. For a 2002 model car with such well rounded design and features, you just can't beat the price alone. Mazda is well known for quality, especially with the RX7 lineage and the up and coming RX8. They go above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to quality and care taken in the making of their automobiles. 


If you want something that stands out from the average sport wagon crowd, and can be upgraded in the future when performance parts arrive, then buy yourself one of these. If you don't like having fun when you drive, and getting economical mileage and efficiency, then forget about it!:)
