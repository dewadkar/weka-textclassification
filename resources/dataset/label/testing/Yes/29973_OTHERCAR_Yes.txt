            I am not going to make this long as there are already so many other opinions just sum up the good and the bad quick.  

Ok, we have been married for 6 1/2 years.  Have a 2 year old.  We first had a Saturn Wagon 1999.  Talk about little when your coming from a Ford Ranger!  Yuck.  Anyway, got the van used.  Had been a program car (rental for Avis-found the sticker).  Very clean and not worn anywhere.  

My only complaint is that it has the smokers package and you just know people smoked in it when it was a rental.  I have quit for 3 years and don't want that in my car!  It is hard enough as it is.

I love the entire car-all auto everything including cruise.  Paint is silver (doesn't show scratches)and the windows are factory tinted.  Very nice on a South Carolina summer day.  Seats are really comfy, even on a long drive.  

The integrated child seats are the best thing ever!  I just pop my son in and pop him out and don't fuss with the seat belts holding in the seat tight.  I just pull up on the strap and it all tightens nicely but not too much.  The pads in the seat can be chucked into the wash for easy cleaning.  My son just loves the seats.  Feels like a Big Boy now.  Out of the car seat.  I think he is safer as well. 

The lift out seats are great for changing the functions of the van.  Not too mention vacuming the entire van quickly.  

The only thing I can think of that's "bad" (but not a complaint)would be that I don't know if it is hot in the back of the van or freezing for my passengers.  They have to tell me first. 

I also keep a spare snow brush in the van for when my son decided to throw his rice cake at the door and it busts into a million crumbs.   I can sweep it all out the door instead of dragging out the vacume every time.  

Oh, they didn't give us a full tank of gas at the dealer though.  Thought that stunk.  Kinda cheapy.  I know it was used but sheesh! I even filled out their questionaire and told them.  They just sent me another questionaire!
