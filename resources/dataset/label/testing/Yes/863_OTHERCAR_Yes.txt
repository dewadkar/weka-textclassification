            I was debating over this camera versus the Cannon models. After I looked
at the results of both cameras, I decided to go with the Olympus. The
quality overall is better and it even does quicktime videos (with sound).

The size is about the same as a non-digital camera of average weight.
The Olympus 3000 allows you to either use the viewfinder or the screen.
If you leave the screen off then you can save some battery life. If you
use the digital zoom, then you'll need to turn on the screen.

Battery life is decent, for 40-50 pictures at 1024x768. I normally use
the Energizer rechargeable batteries. The camera uses 4 AA batteries,
unless you go with the dual battery packs, included with the camera.
The manual was a bit confusing as to what kind of batteries shouldn't be
used, with all the diagrams, it looks like any AA batteries are not 
suitable. 

I haven't had a chance to use the remote control, it's a bit tiny and
I don't have a use (right now) to be needing to carry it around (and
lose).

I have used the movie mode, it captures 30 seconds with sound at one of
two resolutions. I've done 640x480 any the quality was decent. It's not
as good as a regular video camera, but it was sharp. If you move the 
camera around too fast, then the picture will get jittery.

If you take 1024x768 pictures, they are about 400-500K in size, go to
2048x1024 then it grows to 1.2MB. The picture quality is great at 1024,
going to 2048 and zooming in, you'll see that it's not as sharp. I usually
use 1024x768 to maximize my 32MB card (the camera comes with 8MB, I would
upgrade to 32MB or 64MB if you plan on taking lots of pictures).

The only thing I don't like about the camera is that it's too easy to
lose the cap. Before I bought the camera I was doing some research and
some people were saying that you should pick up extra caps because you can
lose it. It's true. Wish they just integrated the lens cover into the
camera. At the very least, not make a camera cap that can pop off if you
bump the cover button against something. I'm really careful when I have
the cap on, and would hold the cap on as I take the camera out (or into)
the bag.

Having the ability to take numerous pictures and then deleting bad ones
on the spot is fantastic. One reason I bought a digital camera. Taking
digital video is another, especially if I just want to capture a quick
thing in motion and not having to carry both still camera and video
camera.
