            I recently purchased this car from a private owner who really took great care of this car.  It has great handling and even though it is a pretty big car it is easy to drive, even for a short person like myself.  I am really impressed and surprised that such a big care would be so easy to handle for a person like myself,  usually I find it hard to adjust the seat to the proper position so that it is comfortable to drive because I am not quite 5 feet tall,  but there was no problems with this car.  I can't wait to take it on a long trip.  

Anyone interested in comfort while driving and ease of driving will like this car.<br><br>
