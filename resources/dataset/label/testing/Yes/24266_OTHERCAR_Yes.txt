            I have owned this for over 2 years now.

I bought it because it had all the options I wanted PLUS it looks SWEET and UNIQUE. DESIGNED BY PORSCHE!

I had a bigger one but returned it for this one. There are other designs on the market that are smaller but I don't want much smaller then this one. Too hard to misplace. If you can't even tell it's in your pocket? Then maybe it's not in your pocket?

It takes very good pictures and the Super CCD can produce very high pixels.

The cradle is nice to have. I just leave it in there when I am not using it. 

This camera is very user friendly and easy to operate.

The 3x zoom works very well.

I bought this when it was close to $800 (Can) It is now below half that cost and is still a very advanced camera.

I have had some problems with the electronic lens not coming out when I turn the Camera on. I am sure there is dirt in there. The people at the Camera store can't fix it unless I can bring it in when it is not working. Kinda like bringing your car in when it's making a noise, then you get there and it stops?

I would recommend this camera.

Fuji makes a good product. I also love Smart Media Cards
