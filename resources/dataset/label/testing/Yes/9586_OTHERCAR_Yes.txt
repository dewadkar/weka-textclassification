            The 2000 Celica, which went on sale 10/1/99, has been totally redesigned  inside &amp; out. There are two models GT and GTS. Manual transmission is standard, automatic is also available. Both models are 3-door coupes. The 2000 model year will not have a convertible. There are two other new Toyotas coming in the Spring '00 with convertible tops - Spider and Solara. 

I purchased the GT with manual transmission. The exterior is very modern, distinct lines like the Cougar and a shape kind of like the Eclipse - only better. It does not look like the picture shown above for the 1999 Celica. It is very fast even though it only has a 4 cyl 1.8 ltr engine (also new for 2000). The Celica is low to the ground with very tight steering - giving it a sporty feeling. 

The pricing is also much improved. In past years, almost everything except the body &amp; engine was priced as an option. Now the options are bundled together and the overall price has gone down. The base GT with manual transmission was $20,120. The GTS (with a more powerful 4 cyl engine) is an extra $4,000. Automatic transmission is extra. Front &amp; side air bags, ABS brakes, ac, cruise, tilt, sunroof, AM/FM/CASS/CD radio are all included in the base price. 

The car is small. I live in a major city, where parking is tight - so it is perfect. However, anyone over 6'1 or 6'2 will have problems. There is not much room in the back seat. I barely fit in back &amp; I am only 5'2. The trunk is large and the rear seats fold down for extra room.

The warranty is bumper-to-bumper 3 yrs/36,000 miles. Engine &amp; transmission are longer.

There is a picture of the 2000 Celica at toyota.com.
