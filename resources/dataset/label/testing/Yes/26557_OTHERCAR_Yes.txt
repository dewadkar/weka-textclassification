            I just purchased My Dimage 5 a couple days ago, and I have to say I'm Impressed. First off, the salesmen at best buy, and Wolf camera both shook their heads and said that it ate batteries so fast that they absolutely couldn't recommend it. Well, I'm happy to say that alkalines are shot in under 10 minutes, but Rechargable nickel Metal Hydride batteries lasted me for over 1 1/2 hours of constant usage before dying... I popped off over 100 photos, 30 of which I used a flash for. Not bad considering... I bought three sets of batteries and a charger at best buy for $60.00. that should buy me about 4 hours of constant usage. I'm not trying to focus just on the batteries, but I know that was my main concern, and I haven't read much real world feedback on that subject yet. My conclusion? Battery situation is not as bad as it sounds....

Next.. It took me a good 2 hours to finally take a good picture. I know nothing about SLR cameras, so I had to take a crash course off the web in aperature setting, exposure value, and ISO setting...etc. The auto mode takes decent pictures, but the auto focus is a tad slow... if you use the flex focus feature though, focusing is a breeze. There are alot of tweakable features for the real camera buff. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but I took a picture in near darkness, and it looked great, I took several others, and they all ended up looking pretty stellar. I'm amazed at the quality of the macro shots.. They are absolutely beautiful. The 7X optical zoom is phenomenal. That was the clincher for me. I love having all of that play. a 2x zoom just doesn't cut it for me. It's a solid camera, it doesn't get as hot as everyone reports, in fact, I find it hard to tell if it's warm from the batteries, or because it's warming up from my hand. The picture quality is far superior to my cybershot 3.2 megapixel by sony. I printed out a photo of about 20x16 at full res on the map printer at work. beautiful... photos printed on my HP deskjet on Kodak photo paper were mouth watering. I've been using a Canon powershot, and a sony cybershot for the last year. This camera is in a whole different class... If you've got the time to learn a little about basic photography, you too can be taking artsy fartsy shots like me in only a few days...

I highly recommend this camera. This is from not a photography expert, but from an average joe who's starting at square one. Any specific questions, e-mail me @ steve@steve-lynch.com
