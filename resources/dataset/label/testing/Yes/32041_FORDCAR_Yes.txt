            I have had an Explorer for two years now, and the superior engineering still impresses me.  Every control button is where it should be, and every feature is well thought out.  I have noticed things like the chrome behind the back tires.  This is an area that always collects road grime, and can't be cleaned properly due to the paint.  Ford solved this by chroming it with the bumper, now it can be cleaned with a solvent.  The automatic door lock control by the very back door is convenient when taking the kids to the mall, especially when loading back up.  We have a lot of options that I thought weren't that important, but now I have become spoiled by them.  I love the feature on the rearview mirror that turns the headlights on (and off) at night, and dims the mirror automatically.  I have also noticed that when my kids leave an interior light on, it turns itself off after several minutes.  The only concern I would have about a purchase is that it might be a little small for a family of five; we only have four.  Overall, I have been happier with this vehicle than any other we have ever owned.<br><br>
