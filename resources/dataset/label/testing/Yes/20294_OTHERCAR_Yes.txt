            I have had my 98 Nissan Sentra for about a month now and I love it. I had to buy a car fast because my previous vehicle was an 88 Dodge Lancer with 130,000 miles on it and everything was breaking down fast! I went to my dealer and told him what I wanted to spend and how much I wanted to pay a month and he pointed me towards the Nissan Sentra. I test drove this vehicle and instantly fell in love with it and took it home that day. The only problems I have with the car is that it doesn't have a lot of pickup when going up hills but I don't care about that and my girlfriend complained that the gas and brake petals are too close but it never bothered me one bit. Another problem is that it doesn't feel like you're speeding even when you are which can be a problem. Anyone who wants to get his/her monies worth in a vehicle should buy this car. It is kind of a small car so people who want a lot of room shouldn't buy it but it's great for anyone who doesn't need a lot of space or for a first time car for a high school or college student.<br><br>
