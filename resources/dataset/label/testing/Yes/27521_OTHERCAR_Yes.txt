            I bought my Grand Cherokee used, but still in excellent shape.  Other that some loose trim on the doors, I have had no problems whatsoever.  I like the feeling of being safe on the road, but it doesn't drive like a truck; I feel in control at all times.  The inside has nice details as well.  There is plenty of room in both the front and the back.  The ride is smooth and without the noise found in some other SUVs.  Amenities that I particularly appreciate include the remote lock, power front seats, automatic lights, and information display.  Before I had purchased this vehicle, I had never thought Jeeps to be anything special; my next car purchase, however, will probably be another Jeep.<br><br>
