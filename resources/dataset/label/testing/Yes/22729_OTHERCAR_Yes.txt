            My mother has owned a 1993 Grand Am SE sedan for a few years before her current car. For the most part, it has been a great car for the price she got it at.

<b>ENGINE</b>
The engine itself has been pretty reliable. It did stop running when the alternator turned bad, but after that was replaced (about $50, not including the towing fees since the alternator decided to quit on the freeway), it ran like a charm. It had plenty of get-up-and-go that would put our Ford Taurus to shame. It was a bit of a gas guzzler as far as V6's go, but the car did have a big gas tank to keep the gas station stops to a minimum.

<b>HANDLING</b>
This car handled exceptionally well. It was as easy to maneuver as a compact economy car. It took curves like it was on rails, like any real sports car. The ride was rough, but that is to be expected of any car with sporty suspension.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>
Our Grand Am was a Teal Blue color. In my opinion, it is an ugly color and isn't suitable for a sports car. It showed even shallow scratches pretty well.

Besides the ugly paint, the actual form of the car looked sporty and fast. We had the optional alloy wheels which looked fantastic on the car (if you have the chance to get alloy wheels on this car, I recommend them).

<b>INTERIOR</b>
The fit and finish of the interior held up well. I found that the back seat seemed a bit cramped for me, and I'm not really tall at all. The front seats were very firm and supportive; a plus in a sporty car. The stereo system, in general, was great. The quality of the sound was excellent as well. The tape player stopped working, even though we never used it often. There was a problem with the fuel gauge, as it seemed to be "sticking" until the car was warmed up. The trunk was very roomy, we have used it numerous times to haul our camping stuff and never ran out of room.

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty car, but doesn't want to pay a large sum for one. We only paid about $5500. For the price, it was an excellent car. Great for those in college or high school.
