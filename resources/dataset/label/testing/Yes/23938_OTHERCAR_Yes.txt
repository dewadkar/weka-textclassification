            WHat a car this is! A beautiful two door coupe made by one of the most trusted automotive makers on the market DImler Mercedes Benz. This car is son nice it's not even funny! Although it's pretty expensive, it has a greta engine and interior. Every SLK comes with a 6 or 8 cylinder engine, leather, wood trim, chrome wheels. My father has one and I love it. WHat a car that is!!!Just when everyone thought the drop-top sports car was dead and buried, last year saw the introduction of a trio of cars, all from Germany: the Mercedes-Benz SLK, the BMW Z3, and the Porsche Boxster. You will definately get your money's worth. The car outperforms all the cars on the street, at the same time you are sitting in your Benz, listening to your Bose Premium Stereo system with a 12 disc cd changer in the trunk and sitting in high quality leather seat. Highly recommend!!!!!!!<br><br>
