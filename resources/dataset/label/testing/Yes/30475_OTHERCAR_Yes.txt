            Toyota's 2000 Corolla is a nice car if a compact car is what you are looking for.  Toyota has an excellent reputation with all kinds of vehicles, and the new Corolla is no different.  With driver and passanger front-impact airbags, it is a very safe car, and saftey is important.  The Corolla can seat 4 comfortably, and five if necessary.  However, I still prefer 2 or less.  There is plenty of trunk space, but if it is still not enough, the two rear seats both fold back for extra room.  Priced between $11,776-15,068, the new Corolla is a very reaslistic option for almost any monitary situation.  The Corolla is great for its class (the automatic has 5 gears plus an optional overdrive), but I must make one last suggestion, get your own sound system, the dealer's stinks!<br><br>
