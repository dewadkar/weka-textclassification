             To be honest, I'm VERY impressed with the Ford Focus. I'm not a big Ford fan, everyone I know with one has problems with them. But I decided to take the focus out to see what the hubbub was about. I'll start with the &quot;specifics&quot;

 16 valve, Dual OverHead Cam (DOHC) with 130 ponies under the hood will get you where you need to go reltively quickly

 15&quot; aluminum alloys come standard, and this car has excellent steering, (you can make U-Turns no problem in this car of you get lost)

 You'll get 25 mpg city and 33 mpg hwy. Excellent by todays standards and even better on your wallet (gas is 2 dollars in some places) 

 5 people will fit relatively comfortably (provided all the small people sit in the back) I'd recommend 4 for long trips but 5 to the mall or movies will be fine. 

 Tilt steering and a center mounted antennae (looks really neat and european) and optional side airbags are available as well. 

 This car is very fun to drive, has some pickup, excellent handling and a smooth ride, however you do hear a god amount of outside noise, which is fine you can just blare the stereo and not notice it. Its not a real bad problem but it can get annoying. And if you need space to move objects around, you get plenty of trunk space (almost 13 cubic feet) 

 For a Ford, I was really surprised at the sleek look of this car, you wouldn't expect it to be a Ford by looking at it. An Excellent car for the price and a fun drive!<br><br>
