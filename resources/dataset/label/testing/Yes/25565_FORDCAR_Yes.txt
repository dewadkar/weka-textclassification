            My husband and I purchased the Sport Trac as a compromise. He wanted a truck and I wanted an SUV.  We have been extremely happy with it. The only problem is that we fight over who gets to drive it.  I will mention some of my favorite features: 

<b>Style:</b> The first time I saw one, I thought it was ugly, but it has grown on me. I like the versatility it offers. I can carry five passengers and still have room for hauling. The bed is a little small, but plenty for what I need. 

<b>Seats:</b> Low Back Bucket Seats with 6-Way Power Driver, Power Lumbar Driver and Passenger, and 2-Way Adjustable Head Restraints. I think they are very comfortable although the back seats are not as comfortable.

<b>Rubber floor mats instead of carpet:</b> This is great for an SUV or any family with children. Simple to clean with a wet washcloth. 

<b>Engine:</b> 4.0L SOHC V6 Engine.  Powerful enough for everything I have used it for, but I do not haul boats or trailers.  Runs great. Mine is actually the 2001 model, and I have not had a single problem with it.  Quiet Ride. Takes a lot of gas though (16/20 mpg city/highway).

<b>Rear Climate and Audio Controls:</b>  I can listen to a CD up front while the kids listen to the radio in the back (with headphones).  They also have rear climate control for added comfort.

<b>Hard Tonneau Cover:</b>  This is an option, but worth mentioning.  I keep it on all the time except when hauling big things.  This cover keeps things in the bed dry and is great for light hauling (groceries, etc).
