            My wife &amp; I purchased the Chevy Express Van in August of 1999.  The purchase price was about $33,000.  It is a low top conversion; GLAVAL did the conversion on this Van. 

Because I have three children, age 1 year to 8, we decided on a LUV (luxury Utility Van) instead of a mini-van.  We drive from NY to Florida &amp; Virginia a few times a year so we felt this was the best vehicle for our needs.  

The paint job on the exterior of the Van is good.  There was some under-spray that I noticed after I purchased the vehicle, and there was a shake to the car when driving at higher speed 65 mph that was noticeable.  I also experienced a small electrical problem with the two of the dome lights.  (Most of these problems were �after market� and not the fault of Chevy)  The interior of the van is fantastic.  The leather seats are plush, and the most comfortable car seats I have ever sat in.  You could easily fall asleep in the Captain Chairs, maybe that is not such a good thing!

On city streets the Van gets about 13 miles per gallon and about 19 on the highway.  Not bad for a vehicle of it�s size.  It is BIG. The video package is great, the kids can watch movies, listen to CD�s and leave the driver (me) alone, while I listen to my own radio and CD player.  This is great when you are driving 6 or 22 hours!

We found that the cause of the shake was bad alignment, and that caused the tires to wear unevenly thus worsening as time went on.  I recently had one of the tires replaced and I would say 85 % of the shake was eliminated.

This was the first van I ever purchased.  I would be cautious of the company that does the conversion, but as for the Express Van, I would purchase another.
