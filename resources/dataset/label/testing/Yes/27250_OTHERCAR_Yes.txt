            The Firebird Trans Am Ram Air is the probably the meanest car known to man in this generation of automobiles.  When you push the gas pedal in one of theses babies, get ready for total excitement.  An even bigger thrill comes if it has a standard transmission with a 350 vortec.  I was going about 30 mph in 3 gear, punched it, and squealed the tire.  The only add-ons I had where Flo-masters.  The sound system can only be described as powerful.  When you listen to the kind of music I do (Rock), you are just completely over-whelmed.  I am just about out of time, so I will have to continue this opinion at a later date.  In the meantime, check out some of my other opinions such as: Powerman 5000, Metallica, Mustang, Quickdot, and MSN Messenger.  These are my most recent opinions and not many people have read them yet.  Thank you, that is all.  ~~~~~

Ok, I am ready to finish my opinion now! :)  Other than the absolute power and booming system of this car, the appearance of this racing machine will drive you absolutely wild!  With it's Ram Air hood and dual exhaust, you will not want to take your eyes off of it.  The minute I laid my eyes on it, I fell in love.  (And I'm not the type that believes in love at first sight.  haha)  But anyway, I hope I have persuaded you just good enough to at least test drive this beast.  If not, hopefully you will change your mind sometime in the near future, because the will dis-continue manufacturing this car in about 2005.  So please, get what you can done now so you won't look back and and think, &quot;Why didn't I ever even test drive on of those bad-ass cars?&quot;  Well, thank you for your time, and I hope to hear all sorts of comments from you ALL.  Until next time....
