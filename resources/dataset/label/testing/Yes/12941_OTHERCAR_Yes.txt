            I love my car.. I bought this car last year after waiting a long time for a new one. Since my DH is a Chevy man..we looked at these first. I was immediately drawn to this car. It looks great on the road and parked. I was looking for a car that had more room for my growing teenagers but didn't want a full size car. This one did the trick. I can easily put 2 teenage boys (all 6 feet each) of them in the back seat and there is plenty of room. Cargo space in the trunk is also wonderful. I carry around lots of sports equipment and it works out that there is always room. My oldest is just learning to drive and he feels very comfortable driving this car, and I feel comfortable with him driving it.

I have had a few electical problems with door/window controls but the great warranty I received from Chevy has fixed them all without any costs to me.

Finally I drive 60 miles a day at the least, and the gas mileage is wonderful. I can usually go on one tank a week which is a plus for me.

If you are thinking about a car, I suggesst you test drive the Malibu. I think you will enjoy it.
