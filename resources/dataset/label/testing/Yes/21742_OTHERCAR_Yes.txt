            I have 2 Chevy Cavaliers. 1991 and 1998. Bought both of them new.  These cars are great!  I have never gotten stuck in the snow because of the front wheel drive so if you drive in snow these cars are no problem. The windshield wiper blades that come with it don't last too long so purchase some good heavy duty blades if you live in a snow area.

The seatbelt system on the 1998 model is not as good as the one on the 1991 model.  The newer system has very short belts. We are a &quot;big&quot; family and so we had to get a seatbelt extender which was annoying. The seatbelts in the 1991 are very long and can accommodate all sizes. If you are &quot;big&quot; and considering purchasing one of these please try on the seatbelts for comfort. 

Gas mileage is great as long as you keep them tuned up.

The cruise control for long highway drives is easy to operate and of course allows you to stretch a bit. 

As far as performance, these are truly &quot;low maintenance&quot;  An oil change and tune up are all you need.
