            One member of my family is just the age now to learn how to use a camera with a zoom and things like that.  This camera has been a perfect digital for her to begin to learn on.  If she messes up the picture, we simply erase it, and she tries again!  What a life saver.  The price you would pay for picture prints that are not at all good will be lessened thanks to the digital line in general!  This camera comes with an easy to understand manual.  There is not much to the camera at all, just finding the zoom and changing the quality of the picture!  I recommend this digital camera to all those who are just starting to use a digital camera and to those who have young children that you are teaching to use a camera!  It is well worth the money you will spend.
