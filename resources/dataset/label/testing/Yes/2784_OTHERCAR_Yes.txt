            I received the Olympus D-340R as a Christmas gift last year and I must say, I'm impressed! First off, it is very easy to learn how to use. The detailed instruction book tells you everything you need to know...and more. I was using the camera like a pro within an hour. While the features aren't many, they are sufficient; things such as red-eye reduction, deleting unwanted photos, and various flash options. 

If there is one negative trait about this camera, it is the way it devours batteries. When using the LCD display, the batteries have a very short lifespan of about a day. The instruction book warned of batteries being drained while downloading, but I don't find that to be a problem at all. Downloads of 20-25 images are relatively quick (a minute or so) even with a 200K/33.6. 

I use my camera mainly for emailing pictures to family and posting pictures for ebay auctions. The picture quality onscreen is fantastic. I have printed out a few pictures and they are so-so. As a general rule, the smaller, the better. Anything above a 5X7 size starts to look grainy. But, all in all, for the $300 price tag, this camera just cannot be beat!<br><br>
