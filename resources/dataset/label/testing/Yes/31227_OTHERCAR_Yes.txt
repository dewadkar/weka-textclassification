            The more i saw Liberty's running around town, the more i wanted one. While the headlights are a little cutesy, they still have the Jeep look. smooth lines, really looks sharp. I had heard the Liberty's were rather noisy, but have not found this to be the case with mine unless the sun roof is open. Tooling down the Interstate at 75-80 mph, the interior was as quiet as any car I've driven in, as long as the sun roof was closed. Even then, it was bearable. the leather seats take awhile to adjust for comfort, but once "tweaked" to just the right degree, they are supportive and comfortable. I'm not fond of the power window controls. When I need to raise or lower the windows, I either fumble on the arm rest or hesitate before remembering where they are. Acceleration is excellent. While I really wanted the 5 speed, I have found the automatic to be smooth and still fun to drive. I bought my jeep used (9000 miles, 11 months old)so maybe all the bugs were worked out of it already. Its fun to drive and it gets lots of looks.
