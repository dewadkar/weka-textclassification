              We bought the Ford Windstar in October of '99, our first seven-seater minivan.  Before this van we had a five-seater which we had outgrown.  We love our Windstar!  It's smooth and comfortable to drive and on long trips the cruise control is a real plus.  

  The stereo is nice and I love listening to books on tape as I go about my daily errands.  Of course the kids want the pop station on.  The kids (we have two) really like riding around in our Windstar, each on their own bench.  No more fighting about the front seat.  

  There are four of us and my husband's parents live four blocks away so sometimes we go on day trips together and there is plenty of room for all of us.  

  In a couple of weeks, the kids and I will be taking a trip to see my family -- about a 12-hour drive -- and I feel confident that the Windstar will perform well and reliably.  

  I recommend this van to any family looking for a nice minivan.  It's a nice looking van, too.  Ours is champagne colored!  Ooh, la, la!!
