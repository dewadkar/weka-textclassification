            My husband & I purchased our '97 Chevy Lumina about a year and a half ago. My parents also own a '97 Lumina and have for about 5 or 6 years now. We all think that they make wonderful cars.

Roominess: 
It has a lot of room in both the front and back which makes it very nice for long trips. The seats are comfortable and come in a variety of materials. It seats 5 comfortable but you can squeeze one more up font in the middle. (The person squeezed in the middle won't be too comfy though). The trunk size is great! We have fit two adult sized mountain bikes in our however it was just a few inches away from closing so we did have to tie it closed. But wow you can really fit a lot of stuff in there. The trunk is lighted and comes with a net that's great for putting groceries in so they don't spill out of the bags on the way home from the store. 

Safety:
The two side seats in the back have 4 point safety belts but both the middle seat in front & back have only a lap belt. It is also equipped with both driver and passenger side air bags. Because of this, children under 12 are not advised to ride in the front seat because it can be dangerous, (this goes for every car with air bags).

Accessories:
It comes with standard air conditioning, AM/FM radio with 18 presets, a clock, mirrors on both the driver & passenger side visors, child safety windows, the volume of the radio adjusts with your speed, 2 cup holders, and a pretty good sized glove box.

Gas Mileage:
As far as this goes, it gets about 28 miles to the gallon on the freeway and I'm really not sure how it does just around town. I drive around a lot though and I only have to fill up about every 1.5 weeks. The tank holds 16 gallons. 

Funny Problems:
In both our Lumina & my parents Lumina the little clips that hold the sun visors have fallen out. But they are very easy to fix, they just need to be clipped in the right way. Also, the drink holder that pops out of the center console has broken off in both of our cars. The only other problem I have with the car that is kind of annoying is the gas gauge. It's off my about a 1/4. When it registers that you have 3/4, you really only have 1/2. When it registers that you have 1/2, you really on have 1/4. It really isn't a problem, it's just really annoying because it seems like when you pass 1/2 a tank the gas just seems to disappear. But when you fill it up it stays at full for a long time. I don't know what's wrong with it but this is how the car comes from the factory.

Maintenance:
We bought our car used with 71,000 miles on it just a year and a half ago and now it has 94,000, (we drive a lot). We have not put one penny into it except for regular oil changes and gas. It has been a truly wonderful car.
