            Since buying a new house in the mountains, I decided that I needed to buy an SUV to get up there in the winter and to move things back and forth from one house to the other with plenty of room to spare.  I shopped around for weeks looking at every SUV that I could find.  

I test drove the Mercedes-Benz ML500, BMW X5, Toyota Landcruiser, Lincoln Navigator, Ford Expedition, Cadillac Escalade which is the same as a regular Yukon Denali with some interior differences, and the Yukon XL Denali.  After these exhausting test drives I decided that all of the SUV's I had seen were too small with the exception of the Expedition which was a Ford, Navigator which is way too expensive for an SUV, and Escalade which was also too expensive for an SUV.  

Why pick the Yukon XL Denali?

The Yukon XL Denali was the biggest SUV I had seen and the most economical from where I stood.  With a 320 HP, Vortec 6000 V8 engine, the Denali provides plenty of moving power to do the jobs that I need it to do.  The Denali also has a high tech air ride suspension system that really makes you feel as though you are riding on air.  The gas mileage is the one negative that I have found with this SUV, but that is common among all of them because after all they are not cars, but some of them like the Yukon XL Denali do feel like cars.  The interior of the Denali is like that of any first class car.  

It highly beat my expectations and the best thing about the Denali is that there are virtually no options except for the optional sunroof and chrome wheels, which of course I had to spring for, it is well worth the extra money.  The third row and extra storage space behind it provide me plenty of room to chauffer my friends and family around while still being able to take some luggage along.  The style of the Denali is very unique with its unforgetable silver mesh grille.  

The handling of the Denali is remarkable, I have never before driven an SUV that handles so much like a car instead of like a truck.  Fitting this Bad Boy into parking spaces is made easy thanks to the Denali's amazing agility.  This SUV surely beats any of it competitors in this ever growing market.  Go and see for yourself why everyone is raving about the new 2002 Yukon XL Denali.  I guarantee that you will now from when you first set foot in it that it is the BEST SUV on the road.
