            *Updated/Complete Revision 1.08.01*

<b>Introduction</b>
<i>Lexus - The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection</i>.  Sounds good, huh?  However, "Does it live up to it's name?" is the question.  Well, yes...and no.  I bought this car for a few reasons: A. Lexus's reputation. B. Handling this SUV gives.

<b>Exterior</b>
Well, this car is the kind where you either hate it, or love it.  After owning this car, I can't really say I hate it, but actually like the design and body of the RX300.  A very aerodynamic looking body along with a "Lexus luxury" look.  The tail lights with the matching headlights are a neat look on this SUV.  <i>The 2001s - a bit more like clear style - are even better</i>!  One thing that doesn't quite match are the windows.  If they tint the 5 back windows (count them yourself), they should tint the front ones to match them.  Sure, it's not that hard to go to a tint shop and get the front to match the back (which I did), but I feel Lexus could have done at least to make it look good and matching.

<b>Interior</b>
This car has a nice interior for an SUV.  A relatively simple and easy to understand audio/AC/CD interface, which makes it good for drivers, so the driver can keep his hands on the wheel while not needing to look down to find the right button.  The interior, in its entirity, leather, cupholders, and all, are pretty good.  Though it seems the cup holders in the back could be a bit better, like the ones for the front, it would be a bit better.  The interior has a nice look to it that goes along with the rest of the car.

<b>Seats</b>
Seats: amazing.  These seats give for a quality, comfortable ride.  Yes, even in a SUV.  Both front seats are power seats, and the back seats can even be tilted back slightly, or even folded down to the front, keeping the seat surface protected.

<b>Handling</b>
Like I said above, the handling on this SUV is phenomenal.  Looking from the outside, it looks like an SUV, but when you're behind the wheel, it's a whole new world out there.  The SUV handles both ways, but leans more towards the car handling.  I suppose this is a success in the <i>relentless pursuit of perfection</i>. :)

<b>Accessories/Miscellaneous</b>
Keep in mind, this SUV is not a car, and most SUVs do not have many options and accessories, so this section isn't too long.

<i>LCD Screen/"The TV"</i>
Owners of this car should know why I call this the TV.  Every person who gets the privilege of riding this car :) always asks, "Whoa!  Is that a TV?"  I don't blame them, because it sure looks like one.  But then, dismally, you reply, "Nah, it's just an extra screen displaying information" (Information that could easily be displayed through small boxes, rather than a small TV size screen.  But it sure makes the interior look more up to date with the technology world.  It doesn't really display much different from your ordinary console.  It states things like: time, temperature, AC settings, MPG (not a very useful tool in actuality), and radio.

<i>Cupholders</i>
4 Cupholders in the car.  2 in the middle, 2 in the back armrest.  The 2 up front/middle are pretty good because they can expand, but the 2 in the back aren't so great, because it is a set size (can size).  The middle ones are really badly placed too, because when driving, one has to reach his hand back to get the drink, increasing the risk of spilling, leading to increasing the risk of accidents.

<b>Overall</b>
In conclusion, this car is a great car, despite its simplicity (after driving a Mercedes-Benz S Class (check out my review), any car is too simple) :).  The handling is the exceptional thing because it is a SUV that handles like a car.  WHOA!  Anyway, I would rather give this car a 4.5-ish, but I'll give it a 4 since it doesn't quite deserve a 5.
