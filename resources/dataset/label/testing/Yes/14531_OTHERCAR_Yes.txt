            I bought my 1991 Honda Accord Coupe at the very end of 1995 for 9,500.  At first, I thought 64,000 miles was too much to have on a used car.  This opinion was based on prior family experience with American cars. However, the excellent condition of the car inside and out convinced me that it had a lot of life left in it. I was right.  Over five years later I have 157,000 miles on it.  The funny thing is, the car runs just as smooth and strong as it did when I first bought it.  I've been very consistent with the oil changes.  Aside from that, the only repairs were exhaust, front brake pads, a battery, timing belt, AC recharge, & tires.  Nothing major. This faithful servant has performed above and beyond my expectations and because of it, I plan on taking it beyond the 200,00 mile mark.  As much as I would love to be in a newer car, I simply have no reason to get rid of this one yet.  I have driven many comparable cars and I can honestly say, this Honda offers the best combination of comfort, smooth ride, handling, and economy.
