            A month ago, my beloved and I decided it was time to go new car hunting for something to replace his 91 Buick Skylark. We looked at what seemed to be oodles and oodles of cars, test drove a few, and finally found ourselves at a Kia dealership in Syracuse, NY.

We test drove a 2003 Spectra, and later ended up buying the same model, with a few added features. This was our first BRAND NEW car, so please forgive me if some of the pro's I list are a little too generalized for experienced car shoppers.

At the end of the day we ended up paying next to nothing for this car, right around $10,000 after rebates and trade-in and so on. Kia is offering a $2,500 rebate which knocks the sticker price of the car down to around 11,500. A totally affordable car!  

We've had the car a few weeks now and there are a few things I'll point out:

- Smooth, comfortable ride: Very quiet car, nothing out of the ordinary, and is a nice car to take outings in and drive around town
- Sleek styling: This car does NOT look like a 10K car! Very stylish body, and interior, AWESOME head and tail lamps. The clear glass on them just makes me melt.
- CD player standard - Kind of a nice feature :)
- Tires leave something to be desired (I'll get to that later on in more detail . . .)
- Gas Mileage could be better(we have an automatic)
- Lots of interior Room and trunk space

Let me talk about the negative stuff first, so I can end on a happy note. Tires are just HORRIBLE. If you can afford it, switch to some Goodyears or something better before venturing any distance. 

On our first DAY owning the car we got a FLAT. The tires that it comes standard with are these little donut looking Korean made jobbies. I HATE them. We had one blow out with 56 miles on the car. Ended up having to put the spare (a donut) on and drive to the mechanic's. Not really a good note to start on!

The car's interior will leave something to be desired if you are a large individual. The seats are frankly a little small. I'm a big girl, and it's a little uncomfortable being buckled in and trying to relax while driving. Could be worse, but certainly could be better!

The mileage with the automatic transmission is just HORRIBLE. I was not pleased the first time I had to fill up. I am so accustomed to driving cars with fabulous mileage (also automatics) that I was a little miffed. I have found out the 5-Speed is just a different beast, get it if that's your thing!

Those are my main beefs. The things I love break down to a few simple things. 

I LOVE the styling. This car looks like it should cost twice what it does, with my favorite feature being the slick looking clear glass tail and headlights. They literally make the appearance of the car!

The space inside is good too. Aside from my big boned butt problem when I drive, there is a LOT of interior room, including a 60/40 fold down seat in the back that folds down to nicely accomodate larger items. The trunk space is great for the size of the car. Lots of room for groceries, or whatever else you need to haul. 

The best part of this car? The warranty! It gives you a 5 year/60,000 mile normal warranty AND a 10 year 100, 000 mile Drivetrain warranty. I'm sure this will be a car that will be in our family for a while, so the peace of mind is a HUGE selling point!

I give this car an A-. A great first car, or even a low cost addition to your family's fleet of vehicles. Worth the money!
