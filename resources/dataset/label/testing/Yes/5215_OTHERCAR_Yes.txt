            As an owner of the Fuji DX-10 Digital Camera, I feel compelled to 
comment on this very easy to use electronic media. The DX-10 is 
usable the instant it's out of the box and powered. With a quick
read of the instruction manual, I found that I was already able to
take quality digital photos. Among the requisites for me, is the
ability to transfer the images to my computer for use in documents
and e-mail. Given several computer interfaces, I was able to suc-
cessfully transfer JPG images directly to the PC, through the parallel
port interface. Fuji provides computer software that nicely facilitates
the computer interface to the DX-10. This software is easily installed
and intuitive to use. The SNAP interface, additionally allows the
user of the DX-10 to control the camera remotely from the computer.
I do have several criticisms to forward, regards the DX-10, namely:
there isn't a full range of remote capability from the computer. Among
the missing functions, time delay shutter control, and Macro focal
range. One additional shortcoming is the total absence of a 110VAC
external power supply. I attempted to order one, and not only are they
out of stock, but were they in stock they're grossly overpriced. 
Other than these two shortfalls, the DX-10 is a fine piece of electronic
photography equipment, and compares very favorably, to the Canon and
the Sony digital cameras in the same relative price range.<br><br>
