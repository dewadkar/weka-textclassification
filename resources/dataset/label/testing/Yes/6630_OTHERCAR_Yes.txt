            When it came to buying a new car, I looked for three things. Fun driving experience makes the top of the list. I did not want to become one of those mindless driving zombies you see out on the road because they bought a Chevy Malibu or a Toyota Corolla. Cars which make driving a chore comparable to scrubbing mildew off your bathroom tiles with a toothbrush. To me fun driving means going down roads with the exhilaration of being on a roller-coaster. Cars which can accomplish this must have stable handling and be responsive to turning, acceleration and breaking. The steering should feel firm and be able to put you at an apex of a turn repeatedly.

The second requirement on my list was reliability. When I go somewhere, I expect to get there and be able to come back. I love day trips and I don't always stay on the well travelled path so I can't afford to own a vehicle which will strand me half way through a mountain pass in December.

The final requirement was that the vehicle be able to carry some load. Whether I buy something new for the apartment or just lug my bike to a group ride, I need to be able to put things in it.

The budget for this purchase was in the low $20K which, for my taste, left me with a choice of the following cars: Acura Integra; Honda Accord; Mitsubishi Eclipse; Toyota Celica; VW Jetta. The Celica was the first one dropped from consideration due the engine. This is a meager 1.8L engine which despite the car's light weight, can't deliver the kind of acceleration provided by the others I've mentioned. The Eclipse lost out the first time I sat in one. The visibility is not very good and although not a big car, it gives the feeling of sitting in a dark, dank pit of some forgotten Scottish castle. It just felt wrong. The Accord would be perfect except that Honda does not offer the V6 option with a manual transmission.

So why did I go with the Jetta over the Integra? One word: <i>Style.</i> The Integra has interior finish harking back to that 80's Japanese import look. Very disappointing. Although the engine is very responsive and the car lunges forward at your slightest fancy, the high revs concerned me. This is a highly tuned sport's engine which put doubt into my mind with respect to its longevity and ease of maintenance, despite Honda's reputation for building reliable engines. I preferred the more graceful torque laden acceleration from the Jetta's V6. The Type-R and VR6 are priced practically the same, yet VW seems to have paid more attention to detail on all of the interior features. Although both cars have very ergonomic utilitarian controls,
the Jetta's controls are appealing and give better feedback when used. 

<b> The Details </b>

So you're probably wondering why I turned down a vehicle like the Integra just because switching the air from defogger to vent position makes a kerplunk sound. It's very simple. I could buy a vehicle I could get just as excited about driving and switching the air from one setting to another entails a very smooth, quiet and satisfying knob turn. Whereas Honda is now obviously selling cars on their reputation and status, VW has gone out and engineered a car people would want based on their experience in it. But it hasn't always been this way. Before their new fleet of vehicles, VW used to be the stalwart German car maker
with their "this is what people will buy" attitude. I remember looking at the third generation Jettas and Golfs and thinking the same thing I thought of the Integra this time around, "How backward"

But I digress.

<b>The Ride</b>

Driving the Jetta has put a new spring into my step. The handling is very crisp. The front turns as if some cowpoke had just lassoed the VW ornament and yanked the car to its new direction. The suspension deals with all this angular momentum very well. There is minimal roll but none of the jarring transfer of road irregularities associated with stiff suspension. The worry of the back coming unglued and flopping around in the wind does not usually bother me in this car. It tracks fun turns very well.

Acceleration couldn't be smoother. The clutch has a balance of grace and power. Ice cream toting occupants can safely please their taste buds without paying attention to stop signs and lights and when their treat is consumed, you can thrill them with amusement park like body pinning acceleration. Just because there's elegance doesn't mean there's lack of power transfer.

The engine copes with all of my lead foot needs. It can be a little too eager sometimes and that's why VW has made traction control available. For everyday driving, the system does just fine but when I really want to have some fun at a light with somebody, I turn it off because it tends to be very conservative and cut power way too early. Same goes for the ABS. Unfortunately, that system cannot be disabled by a simple push of the button. So I've finally made it to my first gripe about the car, the ABS. Since most manufacturers now offer these traction control add-ons on vehicles in this price range, I feel there should be a way to configure them so that these systems can be disabled. I'm not going to get into my ABS tirade here, so lets just say I was disappointed and will be disabling this system as soon as the warranty expires.

<b> The other goodies </b>

The interior is simply head and shoulders above the rest. Let me take a moment to note that this is the result of the VW/Audi relationship. This car has benefitted greatly from hand-me-down A4 features. All of the controls are ergonomic in their accessibility and use and the best part is the way they have been elegantly integrated into the dash. Everything has very satisfying feedback. OK, so maybe I'm the only one that gets excited about the ease and feel of using a turn signal.

As an example, I'll highlight the sunroof knob. Where most manufacturers implemented rocker or slider switches, the sunroof in the Jetta is operated by a knob. The settings are easy to dial-in without looking and give you more control of the open positions. Excellent when you're trying to minimize wind whistle. The sunroof also has a nice air spoiler on the leading edge of the opening which engages when retracted.

<b> The B-side </b>

The Jetta will make you an instant VW enthusiast but having said that there are some drawbacks to the car. For starters, the mundane b*tch about lack of adequate legroom in the back is totally lost on me. If your 30 something kids still live at home with you, then don't buy a Jetta. The Passat would be more suitable. On the other hand, don't be torturing your friends with 10 hour country tours in the back seat. It's not made for that. Short hops to the package store with your friends who want blunts? Perfect. Strapping the baby in a child seat? Excellent. Driving XFL players to and from practice? Probably not a good idea. So my answer is, "buy the vehicle for what you're gonna use it" Obviously it has the backseat room but don't mistake a Jetta for a charter bus.

Here are some drawbacks that I've experienced. I didn't take me long to discover minor rattles and buzzes. There must be something loose in my left rear door (maybe the speaker) because some road surfaces and rap music will make the thing buzz. The driver's seat also has some play in it which will manifest itself upon hard breaking or acceleration. At first this was really annoying (mostly because I just bought a new car) but I've since gotten used to it although I will probably bring this up at the next service. At around 4500 miles, the front oxygen sensor crapped out and I got the mysterious "check engine" light. This was quickly diagnosed and replaced (about 3 hours of service). The interior is also easy to mess up and very hard to clean. The great looking black top of the dash attracts fuzzies which only vacuuming will remove successfully. Wiping only leaves new fuzzies behind. The lower tan vinyl is easy to smudge and only some serious elbow grease will remedy this.

Despite these setbacks, I'm still very enthusiastic about VW and my Jetta. I have never received so much follow-up contacts as I have from VW. These aren't the cheesy "we're trying to appear like we care damnit" phone calls either. I complained to some corporate VW guy in Omaha and the next thing I know my dealer is calling me to schedule an appointment to get this addressed. That kind of follow-through has impressed me. The free service throughout the warranty period is also a bonus.
