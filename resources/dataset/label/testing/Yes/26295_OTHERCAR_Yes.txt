            I bought this vehicle because I was looking for a quick good looking car. My fiance found it for me - I wanted something eye catching and I got it! I love the 160 HP VTEC engine. It's like you are driving along and when you hit 5500 RPM boom this burst of power comes out of the engine and you are gone. I love it!

I love the car because of the speed and the look. I bought the electron blue color because I think it is beautiful, but the car has caused me a couple problems. First of all it has been hit twice and no, neither time was my fault. Apparently people can't see blue as well as red for instance so when purchasing the car you might want to consider buying the red color. Also, all 4 wheels and tires were stolen. Apparently this is because they only come with the Si model, but regular Civics like the one shown above can fit them. It's like an upgrade for their car. I know this is a national problem because when I tried to order new tires from the dealer I discovered even the dealer was getting their wheels stolen off the lot and there was a national backorder for 2 months! So buy wheel locks!

Driving the Si is incredible. It's tight, it's quick and it's comfy. I love driving my car and I intend to keep it as long as people stop hitting it. 

People should buy this vehicle who like to drive. If you love the road and you like to feel the breeze from the moon roof go for it! The car is about 18K and a lot of options come standard on the Si such as cruise control, power windows/doorlocks, keyless entry, moon roof, etc. It is a great car!<br><br>
