            We bought a 1995 used Sebring LX. I have to say that I loved the way this car looked, that is one reason why we bought it. It is  silver color and that makes it look even sportier.We really need a new car, our other one was literally falling apart.  I did not really want another used car because we had so many problems with the one before. Although, that was our only option for the time being because we could not afford a new car.We got this car for a really good price from a guy that we know who gave us a good trade in value for our old junker.I am really happy with this car, not only does it look nice but it rides very well and is great on gas.There is only a four cylinder engine in it, but the pick up is really good.Inside, there are a lot of nice features, adjustable seat belts, trunk release, the console is hidden away, and a release for the gas tank. These are probably regular features in all new cars, but I am not used to it. The way the air conditioner, heat, lights, window shield wiper and cruise control are all easy to reach and are positioned in advantage of the driver.The only thing I do not like it that the back window shield is too high up and it is hard to see out of when going in reverse.Overall, it is a great car.<br><br>
