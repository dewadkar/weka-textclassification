            Cars break down.  It's what they do.  They're complicated machines that simply can't be expected to function perfectly year in and year out.  One must always be prepared to take one's car to the shop or perhaps to buy a replacement.  

That was the attitude I had about cars when I was growing up.  My parents owned Chryslers, Volkswagens, Fords, Chevys, Oldsmobiles, and other quality cars that, for one reason or another, broke down from time to time. 

It was the attitude I brought to my marriage and to my wife's car, a 1991 Mazda Protege.  It was the wrong attitude to bring.  This car has held up to summers in the Southwest and winters in the Northeast.  It has been driven back and forth across the country more times than I care to remember.  I've tried to be good about servicing it, but must admit that I haven't always had the oil changed when I was supposed to.  I have had to replace the brakes and the tires and the other things that one expects to wear out, but have always been able to do so at my convenience.

In other words, though I have failed the car from time to time, it has never--not once in nearly a decade--failed me.  It has proven more reliable than any computer or bicycle or suitcase or CD player I have ever owned.  I love this car.  It frightens me that I have begun to rely on it, that I simply don't think about it breaking down or failing to start.  

The ride has been ridiculously smooth for such a cheap car with only routine replacement of shocks over the years.  And even though it's not the roomiest car in the world, it's incredibly adjustable.  The front seats recline (almost to the point of flatness, should you need to sleep in the car).  The back seats pop forward to give access to the trunk which means that 1) you don't have to pull over to get to your luggage and 2) you can put boards and other long things inside the car simply by pushing the back seats forward and loading through the trunk.

Admittedly, the car isn't perfect.  It tends to become noisy during quick accelerations (such as when you're entering the highway).  The plastic dashboard and seatbelt sleeves started cracking just a couple of years after the car was purchased.  The seats aren't really roomy enough to accommodate my father (a football coach) or any of his offensive linemen.  There are no cupholders; the ashtrays tend to fall out when opened; the wiring to the rear speakers is exposed in the trunk and subject to staticky jolts when anything in the trunk pops up against the contacts.  But these limitations are truly minor in the face of the fact that the car just--in bumper sticker parlance--keeps on keeping on.  

Considering that my wife paid just over $10,000 for the car, it cost us about $3/day to own this car through the 90s.  That's astonishing when you consider what some cars are being leased for these days.  It isn't the kind of car that attracts thieves or brings insurance woes.  It is absolutely the kind of car I would recommend to newly married couples.  I'm no student of the car industry and can't say whether Mazda continues to produce such a quality product.  I am speaking only from personal experience.  However, if past performance is any indication of the value of today's products, I would urge anyone in the market for a car to look hard at Mazda.

Here's to hoping that my unscientific sampling can help you with your shopping!  Good luck.
