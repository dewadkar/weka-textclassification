            My husband recently talked me into purchasing a pickup truck.  This had been his dream vehicle since we married 10 years ago.  We have 3 children and a truck did not seem to be the most logical of vehicles to choose.  But we did it.  

I won't say I am completely happy because it just wasn't what "I" wanted.  However, for a truck, it's turned out to be very surprising.  Not only have we used it several times to haul junk, bikes, toys, and you name it; but it really rides like a very nice vehicle.  It's quiet, smooth, and has a really good take-off.  The one we chose is loaded.  It has a very nice interior and you just don't feel as if you are "roughing it".  Yet, at the same time, it fulfills that manly need to drive a truck!  

Some of the cons include:  ours is an extended cab (obviously with three kids) with no third door.  It is very difficult to get my 2 year old in and out of her carseat.  I would definitely recommend getting a newer model with the third door.  Also, it costs over $30 to fill the tank.  We try to let it get down just to half and fill it so it doesn't hurt the pocket book so much.  It does, however, have a 26 gallon tank.  Another con (for me), is that the AC is VERY COLD!  Okay, I guess to most that is not a flaw of the vehicle but of the passenger.  

Seriously, all in all, I really like this truck.  It's affordable, dependable, and reliable.  Oh, and did I mention, two weeks after buying the truck we found out we're having a fourth child????  So, the final con to this truck is that I wish it seated six!
