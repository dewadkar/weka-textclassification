            I bought my Agfa ePhoto 780c from buy.com because it was pretty and it was on sale - nothing more involved than that. I wasn't expecting too much because it was only about $200 and the only other digital camera I've used was a friend's $1200 Kodak. However, I'm no photography expert, and I just wanted a nice little camera that would take reasonable-quality pictures and save me the cost of developing film and the time of scanning in prints.

I found exactly that in my little ePhoto. The camera came with a 2 mb memory card which could hold between 12 high-resolution (1024x768) images and 96 low-resolution (320x240) images. It also came with a leather carrying case, Agfa software, a serial cable, and extensive electronic documentation.

The camera itself is lightweight and durable. Again, I'm no photography expert, but the features on my ePhoto impressed me. The camera has an LCD screen where you can preview images and delete any you don't want after you take them. You can change the flash settings to automatic, forced flash or red-eye reduction. There's also a focus setting to choose how you want the camera to focus, although I haven't mastered that feature yet. 

The pictures themselves are not absolutely top quality. However, I've only seen one other camera and it was top-of-the-line, so I really have no basis for comparison. The picture quality is perfect for my needs.

After using my camera for awhile, I discovered a few things. To begin with, I was incredibly impressed that the camera would hold 96 images at the lowest resolution, but quickly discoved that I liked my images a lot more when I turned the resolution up. (Is that the correct terminology? Made the resolution better, perhaps?) Therefore, I invested $20 in a 16 mb memory card which increased my storage capability eightfold. I saw similar chips at Target for as much as $39.99, but found it cheaper online after shopping around. Also, the camera goes through batteries at a ridiculous rate. After a few sessions of high-resolution images, a set of four brand-new AA batteries were dead. I've read that rechargeable batteries are a good way to go for such digital cameras, but I haven't yet tried that out for myself.

So, in summary, I am very pleased with my Agfa ePhoto 780c. If you want a camera just to play around with, to send pictures to friends online or make a family web page, this camera is a great value and easy to use.<br><br>
