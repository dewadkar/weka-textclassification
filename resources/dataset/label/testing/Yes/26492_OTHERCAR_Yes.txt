            I've only had my year 2000 Chevy S-10 LS for a couple of months, and so far am very happy with it. I've driven two other pickups in the past - a Ford and a Dodge, both full-sized half-tons. This little S-10 has a whole lot more pep than either of those did, and handles a lot easier for me. 

I am a senior citizen woman, not at all athletically inclined, retired. So easy handling is important to me. I am also very short, and find that I can see out of this one quite well, while I had trouble with the bigger pickups. I traded in a 1997 Malibu to get this S-10, and can see the traffic much better in the pickup.

I use the truck for hobby stuff - hauling compost for the garden; bringing home garage sale finds; transporting furniture and things I buy. The low deck makes it easy for me to load things. It is my only vehicle, so I also use it for everyday errands and such. Though I haven't checked the mpg, it seems to be very easy on gas. I'm only buying half the gasoline I was with the Malibu.

Regarding safety features, it does have a switch to turn off the passenger-side airbag, and the salesman turned it off for me at my request. While I don't ever have children riding with me, I do carry my cat sometimes and am sure that airbag would kill her in an instant. I'm glad it can be turned off.

The only negative I have with the pickup is the fact that the seatbelt won't adjust as well as the one in my Malibu did. The connection at the door post on the car could be adjusted up or down, to accommodate us short folks. The one on the S-10 is stationary, so the shoulder strap hits me right in the neck. I'll have to get an adjuster for it.<br><br>
