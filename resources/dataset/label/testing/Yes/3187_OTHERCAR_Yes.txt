            This is by far the best car I have come across in my line of business.  I collect many cars, but this tops them all.  It rides like the wind with no bumps what so ever and how many people stop and stare when I drive by is countless.  There is nothing I hate about this vehicle except for the fact it is quite small, definatly not a love making car...if youd want to make love in a car that is...Anyone from ages 16 to 80 should drive. No matter what age you are this brings out the youth in me and my best friend Dave...we share all of the cars we buy.  Even if this car isnt in good shape when you buy it, you can still fix it up real nice with a kick *ss system and you'll be all good.  Although it isn't the cheapest car you can come across, it is definatly the best deal there is...what are you waiting for, get out and purchase the first car of the rest of your life... and have a blast!<br><br>
