            My wife decided it was time to trade her 96 Blazer in ( high mileage )for a small pickup. She took her time,looking at all manufactures looking for HER truck. When she saw the Dodge Dakota Quad-Cab it was all over. What she liked about the Q-cab was the ability to carry passengers and Haul larger objects. With the Q-cab you get the best of a suv ( 4 doors,rear seating ) and a pickup bed to haul items.
We chose the 4x4 with 5.9l V8 as we do pull trailers and with living in Montana the extra power is nice in the mountains.

The 5.9l V8 with it's 250 hp and 345 ft lb of torque make it a heavyweight of its class, allowing the Q-cab to pull a 6100 lb trailer when properly equipped, for a maximum GCWR of 10,800 lbs

The interior design provides the driver with all-around visibility for a clear view of the road ahead. Highway noise is minimal. Leg room is good although for anyone over 6'2&quot; it starts to be a bit tight.. All controls are within easy reach of the driver and well placed.

 Handling and ride are great,steering like a sports car thanks to the precision rack-and-pinion steering. 
Fuel economy is in the range of 12 to 15 in town with 15 to 18 on the highway which will improve after things break in more.

If anyone is in the market for a compact pickup they owe it to themselves to check out the Dodge Dakota Quad-cab. You will be amazed.<br><br>
