            I bought my 1990 Pontiac Sunbird in June of 1995.  It had one previous owner.  It's an automatic, has air and tilt steering.  Manual windows and locks.  It has been a very reliable car.  It had 52,000 miles on it when I bought it.  It now is approaching the 100,000 mile mark and is still running strong.

It isn't the quietest car ever built, nor is it the most smooth...you feel the road when you drive it.  I like that though...especially since I often have to drive in the snow during the winter.  The car does very well in the snow and ice (and in the mud for that matter).  As far as gas milage, I get about 25-28 mpg.

I bought the Sunbird because it is affordable and reliable.  It isn't quite a sports car, but it isn't a family car either...it is nice looking, but nothing special.  It's a perfect car for a college student or other young person that needs reliable transportation at an affordable rate.<br><br>
