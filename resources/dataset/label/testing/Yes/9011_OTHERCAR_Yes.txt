            I waited to write this until I have had 4 months of driving my 2000 KIA Sportage.My wife has HONDA CRV and I leased a TOYOTA RAV4 for three years so I have a fair amount of knoledge on SUV's.     I got the car in forest green which is really pleasing too the eye and the dealership through in tinting and keyless entry.It really is a sharp looking SUV! I am 6'2 and it has the most leg room of any SUV in its class which is kinda interesting since it tends to be a few inches shorter than most SUV'S.The back seat is tight especially if the front passengers are above 5'9.The interior is very basic and simple so do not look for a lot of bells and whistles. One thing that is interesting is that they did put money into one area using a thick truck frame instead of a car frame.Also because it is slightly shorter than most SUV'S and the wheelbase is comparable to most, the tipping problem seemes to be lessened.I have taken pretty sharp turns and the KIA did not show any signs of tipping.The electrical problems that occured in previous years has been fixed so there is no problem there.           The engine is solid and comparable to others but goes through a breaking through period where it actually has better pickup a month after you drive it than when off the lot.  130HP, a little noisy but no big deal,decent pickup--but not great.If you are used to 6 or 8 cylinders you might be disapointed.When it is windy and you are going more than 75 mph on the parkway you will feel it.This is not a cadillac or a porsche, it is not for great speed or luxorious comfort.It is a great looking very fun to drive car however.For around town it is great, and short road trips it is a real pleasure.The radio could be better with stations that could come in clearer and the position of the rear speakers even though they are good sounding are very poorly placed.The front speakers are interesting with tweaters right by the window for great highs.A little trick is to take the covers off the rear speakers.My ultimate solution was to get a pair of 6'9 speaker and enclosers for the back and problem solved.If you dont know what im talking about and high quality sound is important,plenty of places will set help you like circuit city(speak to the installers not the salespeople).By the way I am now at 8 months and not one problem.Lovin this suv!!!!!
