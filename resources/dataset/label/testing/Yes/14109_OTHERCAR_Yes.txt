            I traded in my 2000 Toyota Tundra for a 2002 Toyota Tundra Access Cab SR5. I LOVED my 2000 model- basically just wanted leather interior and a new color. So far, other than having the leather interior now in my new truck, I can find no significant differences between the 2000 and 2002 year models. It has the same engine (mine is the 4.7 liter DOHC V8) with all the same acceleration and passing power I love; same sleek, smart body style; same thirst for gas. Living in a small city, I'm currently getting about 17 MPG. Most would expect better gas mileage out of a Toyota pickup, but remember- this isn't just any V8 stuffed under the hood. This engine is a high performance 4 valve per cylinder double overhead cam machine. Actually it's basically the same engine that's in the Lexus 470 (that HUGE Lexux SUV), the Toyota Landcruiser, and the new Sequioa. I can't complain about the MPG because that's a trade-off I accepted when I decided I wanted this performance engine.

<P>The interior is very ergonomic- everything is where it seems it should be. Some may find that the seats are a little firmer than what most would be a accustomed to, but for long trips I've found it to be perfectly comfortable with great back support. The two extra DC outlets are great for plugging radar detectors or car phones, or any extras you may add to your truck. The back seat is almost bolt upright- almost a 90 degree angle which can be somewhat uncomfortable on a long trip, but so far my children haven't complained. Actually I rode in the back seat from Louisiana to Florida and wasn't uncomfortable. I did have trouble with the dome light cover popping off- I finally dabbed a small drop of glue on it and it's stayed on ever since. I do wish that the Glove Compartment had a lock on it.

<P>No changes noted with the exterior. Same cool looking style. I still find that the paint chips rather easily (like when you get a rock peck). I added chrome nerf bars for around $300 which really look nice. The gas cap locks, as does the tailgate.

<P>Some things I wish came standard: antilock disc brakes, towing hitch, daytime running lights, scratch cover touch up paint.
