            The Ford Expedition is a must for the family with active teenagers.  My wife and I have enjoyed the spaciousness and comfort while traveling to the various out-of-town activities, mostly sporting events. We can easily carry four to five friends or relatives with us and enjoy the trip.  The Expedition drives smooth and handles easily in traffic, especially pulling in and out of parking spaces.  The dual heat/ac system and dual sound system keeps everyone happy.  The only drawback has been the fuel efficiency, however, the other benefits far outweigh the additional cost.
 
The thing that has suprised me the most is its popularity among the teenagers.  My two sons are now proud to ride with their parents to church and to other functions.  In fact, my son has borrowed it numerous times on weekends to transport several of his friends to ball games or nights on the town.  My wife and I feel good that he is in a safe vehicle when he is responsible for others while driving.   

To conclude, the Ford Expedition has been a true family vehicle for us and it has brought our family closer together. <br><br>
