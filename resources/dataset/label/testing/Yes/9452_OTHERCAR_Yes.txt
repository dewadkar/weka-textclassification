                             I have read many reviews on automobiles from aesthetic, interior, power, warranty, options, etc...  points of view. I believe an important, but always neglected area, though is from an undercar point of view, and let me tell you, most people are missing a very important part of researching a prospective major purchase by not being well enough informed about the running gear.


       There are some very well engineered and built suspensions out there, but all the same some very weak and suspect ones in my opinion, and my purpose is to help you make a more informed decision. If a decision is being made between one of a few different vehicles, I hope to help you decide based on my experience, which one will be better for you from the standpoint of  strength of, and reliability of, one of the most important parts of the vehicle as a whole, the steering and suspension system.

    The Dodge Ram 1500 four wheel drive pickup is one tough cookie. It is one of the only half ton trucks, if not THE only, to have a solid front axle instead of an independent front suspension system. Most of the newer trucks are coming with an independent suspension for the front, which necessitates the use of half shaft front axles, much like an ordinary front wheel drive car. The solid front axle on the new Dodge 1500 will offer you greater strength, but with the trade-off of a less cushy ride.

      If you are someone who lives in the snowbelt, this is a much better way to go if you are going to mount a plow on your truck for snow removal. The suspension will hold up much better than those with an independent front end, from just the sheer beating that snow plowing gives to a truck. There aren't as many weak links on the conventional solid front axle as there is on an independent system, with bigger diameter axles and conventional u-joints for the axles instead of C.V. joints.

     As mentioned above, the tradeoff is a harsher quality of ride, due to the fact that if you hit a bump on the right side of the truck, instead of isolating it like an independent suspension will, the jolt will be transferred straight through to the left side. But this is a truck as you know, and most everybody buying a truck will reasonably understand ride quality will be compromised anyway compared to a car.

     I haven't come across many problems with the new Dodge, except for the fact that the anti sway bar links are suceptable to early wear out, but don't really make a lot of noise until they are at the point of complete failure. I have seen rapid ball joint wear on these, but in all cases they were used as plow vehicles and the front ends on trucks used for this purpose will always fall apart no matter what make it is.

   Most of the steering parts are factory greasable, so make sure to tell your mechanic to grease the front end whenever you get your oil changed. The ball joints are not greasable on some of these models, so what the factory installs when the vehicle in put together is the last grease it will see. Have a thorough front end inspection done shortly before the warranty expires to make sure if there is a problem with a non greasable component, it can be taken care of under warranty. 

    One word of caution, though if you are considering a new Dodge. The factory spec. on these calls for over an eighth of an inch of toe in, and I can't for the life of me understand why ? It is a solid front axle and there will be virtually no variation in steering geometry as the suspension goes through its range of travel. Because of this, every single new Dodge 1500 through the 3500 rapidly wears the front tires out.
      
     My advice to you is before you take this truck off of the lot, make sure the toe in is set to no more than 1/64th of an inch, maybe even zero. If the dealer can't or won't do this arrange for it to be done at an alignment shop you trust.

    Weigh all of this advice against the other opinions written about other aspects of this truck, like interior, engine etc... and if you decide to go forward in purchasing one it should serve you well as far as the drive train is concerned.
