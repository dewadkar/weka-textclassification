            i bought this car for $17,000 with only 38K miles.  i was thinking about buying a 2001 honda civic but with the same price tag. I chose the used  acura tl, there's no comparison.  


what i love about this car is the luxury at an affordable price.  the leather interior is great.  i love the disc and tape combination with great speakers.   the drive is smooth and having two air bags in the front really convince me about safety issues.  acura has a great reputation as reliable company with durable cars.

the only set-back to this car is that with a 2.5 tl, it does not have as much power as i would like.

overall, this is a car everyone should buy if they can not afford a mercedes or lexus.  i would highly recommend this car to anyone. infact, a week later my brother was so impressed, he bought one with same miles and for only $16K........


update...as of 3/2002, my acura tl and my brother's tl are still in top shape.  It has been well over a year already and this car have not given us any trouble at all.  The most expensive thing my brother and i did was change the transmission oil.  I am beginning to wonder why i even bought the $1400 after market protection.  this car is worth every penny.  I recommend this car to all who wants a luxury car at an even more affordable price than when i bought mine.  keep you posted...thank you for reading this opinion.
