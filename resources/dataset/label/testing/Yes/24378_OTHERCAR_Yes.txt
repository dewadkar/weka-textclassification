            As I read the other reviews of the Kia Sportage I thought...did we buy the same car and  count myself lucky as I'm not disappointed at all!

We got just what we paid for, a low end SUV!  Let's face it, for $14,000 you can't touch many SUV's, to be exact, not any but the Sportage!  

We purchased a 96 model (we bought in Jan. 97 so it had been on the lot for 3 months) but they were eager to sell it and that helped with the price.  It came with a rear window wiper/defroster, spare tire on the hatch (not inside the car as the past years had been - bad design!!), cd player, knee airbags as well as in the steering wheel, four wheel drive (which is easy to get in and out of - a simple stick shift which you don't have to be at a full stop to do like some other 4-wheels), power steering, power windows, power locks and a few other little extras here and there.

We live in North Dakota and knew we needed a 4 wheel drive, and the Kia has meet our expectations.  We've kept it out of the ditches and accident free for 3 winters now.  It's gone thru about 2 feet of snow without much coaxing.

It does drive like a jeep and isn't the most &quot;smooth&quot; ride.  We like the knee air bag feature for the few times we do take it off road it adds a little security.  The seats are fairly comfortable however they have a rather cheap material and we've found that it does stain easily.

The mileage isn't all that great - between 18 (when we just run little errands and it doesn't warm up) and 24 on the highway.  We've had the car 3 1/2 yrs and the only problem we've had is the check engine light has come on three times - we are in a cold climate and the engine misfired...a simple, free fix by the dealer.  It has been reliable in bad weather but I must mention the anti-lock brakes are in the rear of the car, not the front so you have to remember this to avoid fish-tailing when you stop in the snow/ice.  

For the price, it's a fair value and is a fun cute little car!<br><br>
