             I bought an Impala LS with every option except On Star. I bought the car for practicality, and all the features for the price. I am very pleased with the cars handling, brakes and performance. Love the steering wheel radio, cassete, and cd controls. I have gotten an average of 23.5 MPG city and highway.I was realy interested in the car's safety features. I have driven the car 6900 miles in the three months I have owned it. There are a few thing I would like different, like sun roof tucked away so it would open all the way. Also I would prefer rear wheel drive with a small V8. The rear wheel drive would effect the price and that I why I chose this car. Body structure is rigid, no squeeks or rattles.My only real complaint is road noise. This is the reason why I felt I had to respond to others opinions of the car. A friend of mine also has an Impala LS and this is his biggest complaint. The road noise of this car is much more than I expected. I have had undercoating sprayed under the front floor pans.I did not notice the noise on the test drive, because it only does it on certain type of pavement sufaces. Unfortunately there is a lot of the gravel type pavement around here(West Texas). On flat shiny surfaces the noise is virtually gone. I would still recomend this car to others, as I feel all the pros out weigh the one con. Turn up cd player.Light Autumwood metalic looks good, and doesn't show dirt.  <br><br>
