            <b>Why we decided on the Dodge Grand Caravan Sport 2wd</b>
My wife and I spent several days researching minivans, trying to figure out which one would best meet our needs. In addition to the Dodge Caravan, we also looked at the Honda Odyssey, Ford Windstar, and Kia Sedona. I will summarize the important differences and factors that influenced our decision below:

<i>Dodge Caravan versus Honda Odyssey</i>
The Honda Odyssey was the closest competition and there were many things that we like better on the Honda than the Dodge Caravan. However, in the end we were concerned about how low the Honda Odyssey sits to the ground. Considering the size of the vehicle, there is very little clearance between the vehicle and the ground. The other major factor was the price of the Honda and a lack of rebates. 

<i>Dodge Caravan versus Ford Windstar</i>
Basically, we liked the overall design of the Caravan better than the Windstar. On paper, the Dodge appeared to get better gas mileage and offer more features at a more reasonable price than the Windstar.

<i>Dodge Caravan versus Kia Sedona</i>
The extremely low price of the Sedona and the long warranty caught our attention. However, we quickly ruled it out after seeing the estimated mileage and that ABS was not available. Note: the Sedona is a very heavy minivan and the lack of ABS was a concern.

<b>Our Ownership Experiences</b>
I have been very impressed with the Air conditioning on the Dodge Caravan. Our model came with the rear climate control, as well as separate controls for driver and passenger. This is by far the best AC system I have ever seen. On the hottest summer day, we can cool the entire van off in just a very few minutes. 

One major disappointment has been the poor gas mileage. We are averaging less than 14 MPG in the city and around 16-17 MPG on the highway. This is far below the sticker averages published by Dodge. So far, the dealer is telling us it is because we are using the AC and that the numbers are just averages. Hmm...when it cools off and I can run the van without the AC, I will let you know if it improves.

The only other con that I can think of for the Dodge Caravan is the design of the cup holders. I like that the clamps on the front cup holders are adjustable for different sizes of cups, but the clamps are a little too low. The larger cups can be top heavy, which is problem when the clamps are low. Additionally, the cup holders on the captain seats in the second row are low and next to the sliding doors. This makes it hard for younger kids to reach, and it is even awkward for adults given the tight space between the door and th cup holder. 

<b>Conclusion</b>
The Dodge Grand Caravan isn't the cheapest minivan, but it is reasonably priced for the features offered. There are many styles and options available, making it easier to find something that fits your budget and needs. Don't make your decision based on the mileage estimates, or you might be disappointed. Dodge was offering some impressive rebates and financing options when we bought our minivan, which resulted in a very competitive price.
