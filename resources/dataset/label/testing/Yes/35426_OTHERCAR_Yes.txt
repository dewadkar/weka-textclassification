            I own a Cooper S, and it is an absolute joy to drive. I didn't buy it because it was the 'cool car to have' but because of the driving experience it gives. (I got on a waiting list to order my S well before most people had heard of them.)

It is my only car, and had I not found the MINI, I would probably be driving a VW Golf or something similar. I cannot afford a high-end sports car. And I refuse to drive an anemic (and dull) econobox. The MINI gave me the best of all possible worlds: incredibly nimble handling, power when I need it, and a fun factor that goes way beyond anything else in its price range, all while giving me enough room for my everyday needs. It's true that the MINI lacks power coming from a stop, but once I've gone above 2400 rpm, there is more than enough power to pass people on the highway, which is when it's needed in everyday life. (The fastest I've taken it was 105, while passing a monster SUV doing 90. I didn't realize that I was going that fast until I looked at the speedo. The car took it with complete ease. I've heard of other MINI owners going well above 135 with relative ease as well.) 

It's also a blast on twisty roads. It hugs the corners like nothing else - not even Ferraris, which cost ten times as much - beat the standard Cooper in the slalom. "...the Cooper exudes such an immense sense of stability that you can go into a corner at a much higher speed, toss it around, and the car steadily tracks the road with confidence. Our slalom test revealed that the Mini can thread through the cones with moderate understeer and keep a blistering average speed of 67.6 mph, besting any current BMW, any Ferrari, and most Porsches." [Road & Track review, 2/2002]. [ http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=3&article_id=46&page_number=1 ] 

There is a lot more room than you'd think. I've had three adults and myself in the car, all quite comfortably. The two in the back seat were both grown men, one of whom was over 6'-2", and they both had space enough for a short trip (about 30 minutes). Likewise I've loaded the car up with my sister-in-law, two nephews and a whole lot of beach gear, and all fit surprisingly well. 

The sport seats are amazingly comfortable - far more comfortable than other cars I've driven for extended periods of time. I've driven this car for over 6 hours at a stretch and haven't felt fatigued. That's more than I can say for my mom's Lexus LS400, which is supposed to be a cushy car to drive. Some people describe the ride as harsh, but then, it IS more of a sportscar than anything else. Personally, I like a car that lets me feel the road. I have the standard (on the S model) 16" wheels, which I've been told are a lot easier on the tailbone than the optional 17's. I also think that the sport seats do a lot to compensate for the stiff suspension.

Safety - well, it's a small car. It has a ton of safety features, probably more than any other in its class, but if you go head to head with a Mack Truck, you're toast. If you get into a tangle with an SUV or minivan, however, you have a fighting chance. I've seen pictures of MINIs that have had run-ins with much larger vehicles, and there is surprisingly less damage than you'd think. I have yet to hear of anyone in a MINI in a serious accident who hasn't walked away. Some of these accidents totalled the car, but the passengers walked away. The passenger cage is designed to maintain its integrity in a serious accident. Likewise, the engine bay was designed to break away to protect the legs of the driver. In essence, the car was designed to 'give up its life' to save the passengers. You can see pictures and read about one such accident here: http://www.minicooperonline.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpBB_14&file=index&action=viewtopic&topic=11059&48

The best thing this car has going for it is its size and nimble handling. Accident AVOIDANCE is every bit as important as built-in safety features. This car has avoidance capability in droves. It takes a helluva lot to turn one over; can't say that about most SUVs out there. Braking distance is quite respectable; again, most SUVs and pickups can't claim this either. It's small enough to fit into spaces that others just can't; if you have to swerve out of the way, there are more places that you can go in this car than in just about any other vehicle out there, not to mention maintaining amazing control while doing so. It's also quite a bit heavier than other cars its size. So for being such a small vehicle, it's got quite a lot of mass. That's a GOOD thing in an accident.

The one big issue that MINI needs to address is the poor quality of the windshield. I personally have not had issues with mine, but many owners have had one or more windshield replacements within the first year of ownership because the windshields tend to crack easily. Some owners think that it's due to the relative thinness of the glass and/or poor quality glass. MINI claims that it is the upright angle that is causing the problem. Whatever it is, it needs to be addressed. I've heard that they are working on it. All other first-year problems seem to have been worked out and are no longer issues with current builds.

In short, I absolutely love this car. It's a blast, and it's practical, too.  If all you want to do is go really fast in a straight line, then it's not the car for you. But if you want an incredible driving experience for the price then go check it out!
