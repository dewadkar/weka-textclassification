            My family and I bought this vehicle in October or '99 and have enjoyed it immensely.  Good space in back for towing gear, good space in front for the driver and passenger and adequate room for those stuck in the back.  This vehicle has good handling, enough power and stability, and gives a nice, comfortable ride.  A good buy, though pricey at this model.  Like one other reviewer suggested, a three cd changer (for this price) should have been included.  Excellent standard sound system and beautiful interior (Better than most premium edition SUV's I've seen).  If you're a Chevy lover, this is a must buy.<br><br>
