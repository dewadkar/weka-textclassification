            Nissan has finally hit on all cylinders! Obliterated are the lack of power, inferior turning radius and so so styling.  We had a 1991 Pathfinder (purchased new) and had zero problems with it over the years. But When we were ready to update to a new SUV, we wanted to investigate other makes in the SUV world, So the Toyota 4runner (limited) and Dodge Durango (R/T) were thrown into the mix along with the 2001 Nissan Pathfinder LE
The results?
Toyota: Way overpriced ( &gt; 7k over the 2001 LE), Toyota spends way to much in marketing, thus passing on these costs to the consumer (highest per car marketing cost in the industry) per their own sales person.
Dodge: Plastic feel (knobs, switches, etc) to the car w/o a number of luxury options that are available to all of the above (like heated seats). 
Nissan: The only drawback is the lack of a dash mounted rear glass remote opener (a useful feature on the older Pathfinders) Otherwise they have a major hit! Gobs of power, acceptable turning radius, great lines.
The choice was easy!
Our other car is a newer Mercedes 300 series, I prefer to drive the Pathfinder over the Merc, so played the good husband and gave her the Merc, so I could drive the &quot;other&quot; car.....
If you are looking for a reasonably priced SUV, with lots of options for the money, this is the vehicle.<br><br>
