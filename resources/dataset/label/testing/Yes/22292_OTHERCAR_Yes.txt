              My wife and I bought a new Mazda MPV in 1989 which was the first year that they came out.  We used it as our family vehicle for eight years, putting on many city miles and vacationing every summer. Now after ten years and 120,000 miles I am using it for my interior painting and remodeling business.  We bought the four cylinder, which still has enough get-up-and-go, but also great milage (28-32 highway). 
  Besides being a comfortable ride our MPV handles well.  The seats fold to make things roomy and the middle seat comes out. 
  We have only had to have maintenance work done, such as muffler, new tires, and of course changing oil and other fluids.  But other than that we have had no trouble.
  Mazda's are very reliable and if treated well (regular oil changes) will out last the others.
  The only problem we have ever had is with the Mazda dealer.  They tend to charge very high for parts and especially for labor, even on simple maintenance service, so it might be better to shop around.
