            Olympus Digital Camera D-450 Zoom
1.3 Megapixel

Let me begin by saying that wherever technology is concerned, I learn only what I must, much like my husband &quot;does not understand how to use the washing machine or dryer&quot;.  I don�t have to know, so I save those brain cells for the things I really want to learn.  But, I <b>do</b> know what I like.

My husband gave me the most wonderful birthday gift this year. I received an Olympus Camedia Digital Camera D-450 Zoom camera.  This is the best birthday present I�ve ever received.  Up to this point, I only bought disposable (or practically disposable) camera when I went on vacation or to the family reunion and was quite content with the results.

You may realize by reading the first paragraph here, that I was pretty intimidated by this new &quot;fan-dangled&quot; instrument.  I just looked at it for a week or two, then finally, one afternoon, I got out the manual and started to read�one page at a time.  Now, be aware that the manual is quite thick and that may have contributed to my initial intrepidation.  Well, you only need to be concerned about one-third of the book, as it is in three languages; English, French, and Spanish.

Ok, so I stuck to English and progressed through the book.  One of the first lists that I would like to share with those of you who care about those sorts of things are the &quot;Main Features&quot;:

*The 1.310.000-pixel CCD delivers the highest picture quality in its class.
*The Olympus high-resolution 3X optical zoom lens plus the Digital Tele mode* make possible photographs equivalent to 6X zoom.
*Built-in buffer memory dramatically reduces the recording time.
*A wide-angle TFT LCD monitor is used for the first time in a digital camera.
*A removable SmartMedia (SSFDC) memory card (with Panorama function) is provided.
*With the provided Video output connector (NTSC) pictures can be viewed on a TV.
*Direct printing available via the optional Olympus printer P-300/P-330, allowing you to print out images whenever you need them in any quantity.

Now, that I have that out of the way, let me take you on a journey with this &quot;tecnophobe&quot;.  First, I just wanted to be able to take a picture, any old picture.  I thought if I could put a couple of passable pictures under my belt, I could get more involved without fear.

First things first.  I read the instructions relating to putting the parts together and identifying buttons and screens and things.  I <b>strongly</b> recommend reading all the instructions before touching the camera.  Let�s do this for people like me that need, &quot;just the facts �mam&quot;.

1.  Your camera needs power.  In this case it is 4 AA batteries (there are some specific safety messages on the batteries in the manual..read them).
2.  Insert the SmartMedia card.  This is the little guy that stores your pictures (big-brother-to-film, if you will).
3.  Turn the camera on. (doh).  Well, there�s a good reason to say that, because we�re just going to check &quot;stuff&quot; out.  This is done simply by moving the lens barrier off of the lens.  Now, check the &quot;Control Panel&quot; which is on the top of the camera as you hold it to take a picture.  Starting from top left on the control panel are 1) Sequential shooting. This can be set on SQ 2 frames/second, HQ 1 frame/second, SHQ 0.6 frame/second.  I have not tried this one yet (just taking 1 picture at a time has been my focus so far).  But, I think it would be fun to take a sequence of my cat and place it in animation.  2) Flash modes.  You can set the camera to no flash, Red-Eye Reducing, Fill-In Flash, Slow Shutter or all the previous 3 at once.  3) Preset white balance.  4) Image Memory Blocks.  5) Macro Mode. 6) Spot Metering Mode.  7) ISO.  8)  Self-Timer.  9) Exposure Compensation.  10) Battery Check.  11) Number of Storable Pictures.
4.  Each of these features can be changed and controlled with the buttons on the back of the camera.  Now, we will take that tour.  On the back of the camera we have an On/Off button for the LCD monitor on the back, so that you can see your pictures and work with the &quot;settings&quot;.  There is also a Menu button which will assist you in setting all the modes that you wish.
5.  Other buttons on the back are a +&amp;- button which you can use to view different pictures you have already taken or to make changes in the photo &quot;modes&quot;.   There, then is a button marked OK which gives you the opportunity to stop if you have made a mistake (that�s the one I use the most).  There is a button for function, flash, deleting pictures taken and protection (which helps prevent erasing a picture you really want to keep).
6.  To take a picture is really easy, as I was surprised to find.  Literally, point and shoot.  If you view what you wish to take a picture of, you press the button down about half-way.  At this point you see in the viewer a yellow and green blinking light.  When the green light becomes steady, you press the button down all the way and, VOILLE!, there is your picture.  Yes, it takes some playing to discover exactly the results you like.  

One great thing about this camera is that you don�t waste film while you are learning.  You don�t like it?  Erase it!  So, needless to say, most of the first ones I took are currently ghosts of photos past.  There are so many more things for me to learn, I can�t imagine how long it will be before I have &quot;mastered&quot; my camera.

After you have taken your pictures you can load them onto your computer (which is surprisingly easy to do) and adjust, crop, store and use them from there.  (That is what I do, I haven�t had any yet that I necessarily want in hardcopy).  If I do, I will probably order copies through one of the many services available on the internet, like Zing or Studio Avenue.  So far, I have primarily used them on my website and for Auction items on eBay.

There is much more to this camera, but, if you are anything like me, you just begin at the beginning, reading and experimenting.  Oh, by the way, did I say, I LOVE THIS CAMERA!?
