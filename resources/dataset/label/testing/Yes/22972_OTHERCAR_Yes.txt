            The PDC 640 is compact, easy to use, and takes phenomenal pictures, for a digital camera.  We have been using ours for almost a year now.

Pictures are stored on a memory card inside the camera, you can set the quality levels for smaller, lesser quality shots, and take many more pictures...  we prefer the quality when the camera is set at 24 pictures. Extra memory cards can be purchased.

This camera has a lock feature, so you can review the pictures and &quot;lock&quot; the ones you do not want to accidentally erase.

It took some practice for me to get used to the settings, if you have the camera set to take close ups and the object is farther away, the lighting will not be right...  the pictures may appear yellowed.  You can see this immediately though, so there is opportunity to retake the shot.

The software that is included with the camera is comprehensive, it allows you to lighten, brighten, add borders and effects, even make cards for sending through e-mail.  

I have used more expensive digital cameras, but the picture quality was not as good as on this one.<br><br>
