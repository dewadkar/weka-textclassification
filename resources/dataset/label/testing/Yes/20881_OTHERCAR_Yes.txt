            I had the chance today to test-drive the all-new, 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser.  I left the dealership with mixed emotions about the car.

The first thing you notice about the car is the styling.  Tall in height and short in length, it doesn't look like anything else out there.  While I'll admit that the first time I saw it, I thought it was the ugliest car on the planet, my view on it's appearance has softened somewhat, and I think that this car has grown on me as far as appearance.  Besides, the Pontiac Aztek now holds the title of Ugliest New Car. (but that's another review...)

This car is a Chrysler brand, which gives you the impression of luxury.  The car certainly fits the bill here.  The fully-loaded tester I had contained every option on the book, including chrome wheels, leather interior, and a dealer-installed CD changer.  Even with all this, the sticker was under $22,000, making this car a great deal for the money.

Room is something this car has in spades.  There's enough head and legroom up front to satisfy even Shaquille O'Neal, and even the rear seat occupants won't want for room.  The leather-lined seats are supportive, and a little firm. Just right for day-to-day driving, and the occasional twisty road.

And if you don't need all that interior room, the rear seats fold flat, or even remove completely, for cargo duty.  With the back seat and front passenger seat folded flat, the car can carry objects as long as 8 feet with the rear hatch closed.  This car was obviously designed with a fair amount of utility in mind, as well.

Handling and braking are also well sorted-out on this car, with very little roll or dive in cornering and braking.  Brakes are four-wheel discs with ABS, giving sure-footed, fade-free response.

The one major aspect this car has wrong with it, however, is its engine.  The only engine available is a 2.4L DOHC four-cylinder, culled from the Stratus/Cirrus cars.  While adequate to move the vehicle, it's not good for much else.  Power delivery is downright anemic, and the car feels very weak and underpowered.  While I'm not concerned with overall tire-burning performance, I'm more concerned with what will happen to this thing once it's loaded down with people, and their stuff.

The future looks bright, however.  Rumors of a 200-HP turbocharged variant are circulating, and may come to fruition by the 2002 model year.  If that's true, then this will certainly be a great car for a lot of different people.

UPDATE: (6/25/02) The Chrysler PT Cruiser Turbo is coming for the '03 model year with a 215HP turbocharged four-cylinder.  This engine will also be available in the upcoming Dodge Neon SRT-4.  It appears the PT's power problem has been solved.  PT Turbo test drive coming soon.
