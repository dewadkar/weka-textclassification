            The Lincoln Blackwood is unlike any vehicle you've ever laid your eyes on...or driven, for that matter. Lincoln describes it as being "50% utility vehicle, 50% luxury sedan - and 100% original." 

I work for a Lincoln-Mercury dealer. When we took the brand new Blackwood for a drive, it was just unbelievable. A person driving a pick-up truck pulled up next to us at a stop light and asked us what on earth we were driving and how he could get one. The attention this vehicle gets is unreal. I can honestly say that I have never driven a vehicle that turned <b>so</b> many heads. Either out of curiosity or intrigue, people just can't take their eyes off the Blackwood. Autoweek best explains the likely purchasers of the Blackwood: "This is a bad-boy luxury, for the person who wants to look like they work hard for their money." And "This is the vehicle rap stars put four subwoofers in the bed." I can guarantee, the Blackwood will be seen on MTV's Cribs (tours of celebrity homes & cars).

<b>Exterior:</b>
In a word, "smokin!" The front of the Lincoln Blackwood is so similar to it's big brother, the Lincoln Navigator. Once you see the side of the Blackwood, you will notice a mix between a luxurious car and a utility vehicle. The Blackwood has 4 full-sized doors, so it surely resembles a sedan, but it also has the functionality and towing capacity of a pick-up. The rear of this vehicle boasts a generous 4.7' long, 4' wide cargo bed, which features a power-operated hard "tonneau" cover. The stainless-steel lined trunk is sealed so that rain, snow, dirt and dust won't be making their way in the trunk. 

The entire trunk area of the Blackwood displays a unique "Wenge" wood appearance trim. As if the exterior isn't unique enough, it also features dual swing-out composite doors. They open straight out so loading cargo or groceries is a snap. These doors even have storage bins (as do other areas of the trunk). I'm telling you, Lincoln thought of everything! A full-sized wheel and spare are stored under the vehicle.

Folding side mirrors are nothing new, but programmable ones are. No more fuss with the mirrors after your husband or wife drove the car. A lot of work went into these exterior mirrors, they are also heated and they feature an LED turn indicator when the turn signal is on. 

The windows are constructed out of "solar-tinted" glass and "privacy glass" is used in the rear windows. 

The Blackwood sits upon 18" aluminum wheels and all-season performance tires (P275/55R18SL). Our model has hot Perelli Scorpion Zero tires and some fancy-looking chrome rims. Lincoln addressed every detail, the door handles and the fuel door are chrome-plated. 

<b>Interior:</b>
The interior of the Blackwood is a site to behold! Really, you won't believe your eyes. It is luxury all the way. From the very roomy leather-trimmed seats, to the real wood accents on the instrument and door trim panels. You'll also find duplicate automatic CFC-free climate control and audio controls. For families with multiple drivers, the Blackwood's driver's seat and adjustable brake and gas petals are all programmable for up to three drivers.

The Blackwood's overhead console contains an on-board trip computer, which displays compass direction and it calculates distance-till-empty as well as average fuel economy. Courtesy lamps and power moonroof controls also reside in this overhead console.

Let's talk sound for a moment. How does a 140 watt Alpine Audiophilt sound system sound? AM/FM stereo, cassette and a 6-disc CD changer are all featured with this system. But how does it sound? Aside from rocking the vehicle, this stereo has a very clear, crisp sound - thanks to the 7 speakers and a sub-woofer. A convenience we'd all enjoy, the Blackwood has speed-compensating volume.

<b>As Far As Comfort Is Concerned:</b>
Four large adults can be seated very comfortably in the Blackwood. The front seat occupants will enjoy climate-controlled seats, which heat and cool your seat The difference between the seating in the Blackwood and the seating in another S.U.V. or pick-up is like the difference between first-class and coach seating on a plane. The perforated leather seats are ultra comfortable. Shoulder, hip and leg room are gracious in this vehicle. You know how most vehicles have nice, big seats in the front and the back seats are a poor excuse for a seat? Well, this is not the case in the Blackwood. The rear seats are just as plush, roomy and comfortable. 

All of these seats are suitable for executives, since there are 4 12-volt "power points" in the interior of the vehicle, with an extra located in the trunk. So, powering equipment such as a cellular phone, laptop computer, etc is a piece of cake.

<b>Great Options:</b>
The Navigation System is a marvel, which senses and maps your course by using G.P.S. (Global Positioning System) satellite signals. This system includes a 5" display screen and CD-Rom for approximately $1,995 (price may vary by dealer).

<b>Available Colors:</b>
There's only ONE exterior color option at this time, which is Black Clearcoat. The only available interior color is Midnight Black.

<b>Engine (& Such) Specifications:</b>
The heart of the Blackwood is a 5.4 liter, 300-horsepower, 32-valve, DOHC InTech V8 engine with an electronic engine control system. 355 lb-ft of torque adds some real "Ooomph" to your ride. It's a 2 wheel-drive, rear-wheel driven 4-speed electronic overdrive transmission with <i>very</i> smooth shifting. 

The Blackwood halts due to its power-assisted 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.

<b>So, How Does It Drive?</b>
The Blackwood is Quick! But I must admit, it drives like a truck. Which isn't a bad thing, considering it IS one. The Blackwood drives like a Navigator, it felt very similar. Driving the Blackwood is an enjoyable experience, I recommend it.

<b>Towing Capacity:</b>
The Blackwood's towing capacity max is 8,700 pounds

<b>Measurements:</b>
The vehicle measures 18.35' in length, the width (excluding side mirrors) measures 6.5' and it is 6.13' tall. The Blackwood is a beast, weighing in at 5,700lb.

<b>Safety Issues:</b>
Dual front airbags and dual front side-impact head/chest airbags ensure your safety during a collision. The Blackwood also features a reverse sensing system, to protect your vehicle from a needless collision. All passengers will be safe wearing the 3-point safety belts. The Blackwood's safety features also include anti-intrusion door beams, child-safety locks on rear doors, SecuriLock anti-theft system and a remote keyless entry system (with panic button, illuminated entry, power trunk and driver's side keypad).

<b>Where Fuel Is Concerned:</b>
Blackwood's hefty engine requires a good fuel, 91-octane is recommended. The fuel economy of this vehicle is 12 for city driving and 17 for highway.

<b>In Conclusion:</b>
As you can see, the Lincoln Blackwood is in a league of its own. This vehicle is adaptable to any occasion. It is extremely unique and it just screams luxury. My opinion is that it drives exceptionally well, the engine is a powerhouse, the exterior is very cool looking and the interior is luxurious and spacious. I think it's a very special vehicle and I am glad that Lincoln thought of it. If you want all eyes on your vehicle, the Blackwood is it. Or, if you just want to drive in the lap of luxury while towing or carrying cargo, this is the vehicle for you. But at the same time, this vehicle is SO versatile, anyone could drive and enjoy it. The only con is that not everyone needs or wants a pick-up. But, it is very <i>close</i> to perfection otherwise.
