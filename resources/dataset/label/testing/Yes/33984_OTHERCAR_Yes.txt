            My Mom got this camera through AOL.  She actually spent good money for one, and it had problems.  They sent her this one in replace for the first one.  Well, lets say they got the best end of the deal.

I have 2 words to say about this camera.  BATTERY HOG! I don't think I have ever came across a camera or anything for that matter, that eats batteries like this camera does.  I am lucky if I get 3 pictures, before it is flashing low battery.  Usually I can shut it off, and wait about 15 minutes then it will take a few more.

I do sell stuff on Ebay so this camera is good for that. But you do have to make sure your lighting is right or you won't get a good picture.  Not even to post on Ebay.

I have used better digitals before, and I enjoy having the feature of being able to see the picture after you take it.  With this one you don't. So you never know what your pictures look like until you upload them to your pc. It auto sets itselfs for 8 pictures before it is full, but if you put it on a lower resolution you can get up to 28.  That is if the battery holds up.

Another bad thing about it is you can't delete one picture at a time.  If you want to delete, it deletes them all. So you either delete or wait until you get to your pc to get the pics out.

This camera came with Photosuit which is a very good software.  It lets you do all sorts of things with the pictures you have.  Banners, Calendars, Frames, Collages, ect.

To sum it up, this camera is o.k if you are staying at home close to your pc, to unload the pictures as soon as you are full.  If your going away from home I suggest trying a different camera, or pack your pc with you.
