            I bought my Cavalier in 1991. It was my first car and I wouldn't trade it for anything else. It is a very dependable car. I Recommend this car to anyone that is always on the run!! It runs great in bad weather, whether it is snow or ice. It is a safe car. It has a lot of room to take things to and from places. It comes in handy going to and from college. The radio that came with the car was clear and loud. The interior is nice and stylish.The seatbelts grab tight when I slam on the brakes. This is a great first car from anyone that is just learning how to drive.<br><br>
