            Remember that many of these cars are now ten years old.  But, with the right experience in driving and if the car is well maintained, then it makes for a very good driving experience. Of course the package can mean the difference between stumbling and responding in terms of handling.  I have the 3.0liter V6 which is a little bigger and stronger than the new Sebring 2.5liter engine.  My Lebaron is a GT, with a suspension that provides much better handling than a normal Lebaron.  I took my Lebaron up a canyon road with very sharp turns and had grades of 5-12%.  I was taking it up that road at an average of 45mph and even hit 70mph at times.  I can take a 10%grade at 50mph and can go as fast as 75mph with no problem.  On a good leveled road with good conditions can accelerate from 0-60 in just over 8sec.  The fastest I have ever driven it is at 112mph(note: the car has only standard 14&quot; rims and regular all season tires).  The car has 102k miles on it and I have had to rebuild the transmission, replace the distributor cap, a bearing, the alternator, and some hoses, spark plugs and wires, but that's what a car is.  Cars need maintenance.  Ever wonder why a mercedez seems to run forever.  It's because for at least the first two to five years it had scheduled maintenance to keep the car running smooth for longer. Over all if you take care of the car, it will make driving very enjoyable.  I would recommend this car to someone who is willing to adequately maintain it and enjoys just enough power and handling to have fun but not quite race track fun.  I will soon be placing some 225/45R16 rims and tires on mine and will try to provide a photo to some Lebaron webrings and homepages.
