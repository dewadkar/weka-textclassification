            I bought the Camry because my wife and I needed a second car.  We looked for a dependable and affordable vehicle with a good reputation.  The Camry is not a flashy, high performance vehicle, but it's the perfect car if you want a reliable car that's easy to drive.  It drive smoothly, handles adequately, and has a relatively low noise level.  I've had it for over a year now and there has been no problems with it except for a flat tire.  It still drives like new.  The interior is slightly larger than a similar sized Honda Accord, our other car.  Back seat room is also good.  The leather interior option looks nice, but we had two kids so we opted for the fabric.  The four cylinder engine is exceptionally smooth and feels almost like a six cylinder.  Trunk space is OK.  Handling is so-so, but the ride is smooth and pleasant.  Engine power is fairly typical for four cylinder models.  It's a fairly generic car...meaning every guy on the block seems to have one and the styling is not exactly revolutionary.  But its ubiquity is a testament to its quality and dependability.  You won't turn heads when driving down the boulevard, but on the other hand how often do you see a Camry stranded on a freeway shoulder?  <br><br>
