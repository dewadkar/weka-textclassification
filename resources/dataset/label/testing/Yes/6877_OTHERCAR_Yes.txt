            We purchased a '99 Hyundai Elantra Wagon Wildberry color &amp; it is fabulous! No blind sports to obscur vision as the Taurus wagon had.  10 year powertrain warranty, 5 year 60K bumper to bumper warranty with a 5 year emergency repair line (FREE).  A refill of gas is FREE on the freeway....
The back storage is wider than my '95 Saturn wagon I traded in for it. 
100 watt cd player &amp; 6 speakers give a whole new meaning to performers.
Then only bad part is what they call a center console with armrest.  The storage compartment with armrest is the size of a cell phone.  A bic pen put into it won't close the lid.  So passenger gets armrest (my husband wins).  Store CD in a rack on the back floor.  Lumbar support was also included in the driver's seat. Cruise control is very easy to operate.
Electronic locks operate all doors &amp; trunk in one quick click.  Very safe car!<br><br>
