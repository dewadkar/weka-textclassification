            I purchased this car brand new in 1996. My car has about 63000 miles on it and has caused me only a few problems. 

The first year I had the car I was in love with it. My two kids and I fit beautifully in it. Then after about two years the car started to be extremely noisy when driving. There is some very annoying sound that is around the tire area that drives me crazy. The saturn people have no idea what is causing it.. The car had some problems not starting.. Who knows why ,it wasn't the starter. All in all the car is okay..Mainly my problem with the car is a lot of little things. 
The things I dislike  about the car are:
1. The noisy ride
2. The car is extremely low to the ground.(hard for elderly people to get into)
3. There is not a lot of room for tall people anywhere in the car.
4. There really is not any room for more than 4 adults in the car. I have three kids and forget them sitting in the back. No room.
5. Saturn has it so that you basically can only go to them for major work on the car.
6. Even the car wax has to be a saturn brand because of the special paint on the car

The things I enjoy about the car are:
1. The insurance is pretty cheap for the car.
2. Reliability
3. Gas mileage
4. Looks

   I can't say if I would purchase this car again for my family car. Maybe if it was just 2 of us. I might consider the new larger line of saturn wagons.. Then again maybe not.
