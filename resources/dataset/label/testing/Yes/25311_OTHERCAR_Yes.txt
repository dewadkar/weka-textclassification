            Jack did not think he would ever have to use a digital camera in his studio.  In fact, as an old school type of photographer, he was doing very well.  In a fast-growing town where he has been working for more than 45 years, he has seen his share of technical and photographic changes.  During that time, he has taken the pictures of most married people around here.  With the old-fashioned and trusted film cameras!  "There is nothing wrong with them," he said to me during a light morning breakfast.  He has managed to resist all my prodding and pitches to him.  He did not want to invest in a camera that would not match the prestige of his studio.  He was worried about the output and the reactions of some of his faithful clients  at the sight of a digital camera in his expert hands.  Then, out of the blue, he told me that he was going to learn how to use a digital camera before buying one.  He wanted to take a class to combat his fears of all things new.   A few weeks after his class, he asked me to go window shopping with him.  By the way he acted, I was certain that he had done his homework.  He knew what he wanted.

<b>The Nikon Coolpix 5700 Digital Camera's features appealed to Jack's sense of dramatic photography</b>

Well, this camera was the right one for him.  Jack is the type of photography buffs who have a certain penchant toward what's able to deliver prestige, pizzaz and flair.  He set out to get the Coolpix 5700 which brings together most of the Nikon hallmarks.  Who does not want to have superb optics, precise control and reliable and great functionality?  That's what this camera is capable of delivering.  He knows that optical zoom that the camera spots is very valuable in that it shows the true zoom range of the lens.  With 5.0 MP, he will be able to work with most of his advertising and wedding clients.  

Being a starter camera for him, the sleek, stylish Nikon met his needs.  It also matched his skills and experience.  With the Nikon's Scenes modes, the camera automatically adjusts all the settings (for portraits, landscape or sunsets).  In addition, he likes the fact that he can just point and shoot.  He mostly takes this camera on the road.  At the most recent Grand Valley Fair, he used it mostly to take shots of the throngs of clients waiting outside his tent.  With his established reputation and addition of some young honks, it was a quick money maker for the company.  The female fairgoers dragged their boyfriend to the tent to experience their quick, neat digital photography experience.  Oh, the clients were so excited by the photos or printed t-shirts they held in their hands as they walked down the premises of the fair.  
For sure, on such occasions, one can realize the true meaning of the saying, "Pictures are worth 1,000 words and images last forever."  All of this is made possible by the use of the world-renowned Nikkor lenses.  As a pro, Jack knew a good thing.  He did not want to pass such a great camera!

Convenience and functionality are the names of the game.  With the Nikon Coolpix 5700, you will be able to take advantage of its advanced features and settings.  For example, the Nikon's One-Touch Upload is one of the best transfer software on the market.  It will allow you to quickly send  pictures to your computer or the web.  If you want to send pictures to your friends and family members, it will be this simple too!  You can't go wrong with the great software packages that come with the camera.  Editing and adding your creative touch will be a breeze!

<b>Are you a digital artist?  Do you want to take your digital performance to the next generation?</b>

The answer is to start with a great camera.  The Nikon Coolpix 5700 is an investment in your studio.  If it's just a hobby, it will show how serious you are about your photography.  There is no doubt that you want to capture the right pictures.  The first thing is to have the right camera.  

I truly believe in the performance of this camera.  If you can't get a Minolta Maxxum 4 or a Canon Eos Digital Rebel or an Olympus E-1, you can go with the Coolpix.  No matter how fierce the competition may be, you won't have to regret your purchase at all even if some of these cameras may be part of a totally different generation of cameras.
