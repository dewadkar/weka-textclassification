            Well here I am, middle aged and loving it. We are trying to hold on to our youth so I went out looking for a red sports car. Of course, those of us from the baby boomer group have to do our research. The more that I read about the newly redesigned Pontiac Grand Prix, the more that I felt like it was the car for me. I wanted the loaded out high performance version with the GTP logo. The first year was the 98 but it had some limitations because of the power factor. I looked in the 99 models but they were hard to find in my area and the color that I wanted. As 2000 got closer, I opted to wait for the new 2000 year. It would seem less old as the 2000 increase. In 2000 Pontiac came up with some new colors and they made a red one just for me. It has all of the bells and whistles. I especially enjoy the Heads Up Display which projects the speedometer reading in the line of sight about the front of the car. This Pontiac Grand Prix GTP with it's supercharged 240 horsepower far exceeds my expectations. I have yet to really put it to the limit but it will get around an 18 wheeler. All of the new safety and security features are a saving on my insurance also. It makes driving fun again after moving down (or up) from a full sized vehicle. The seating is very comfortable and it has the radio controls on the steering wheel which also displays in the windshield.
This vehicle is designed for the me's out there that grew up with the super powerful "hotrods" that have long since left the roads. I would like to give my old '57 Ford a run in this GTP. I opted for the 4 door version so that I can put my granddaughter in the back and open the moon roof and go driving with the two loves of my life. If you don't like to drive the you probably would not want a car this fun to drive.
