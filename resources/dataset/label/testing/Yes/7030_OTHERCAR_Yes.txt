            When I bought this car back in 1997, I was a college student working 2 jobs.  And now I am a licensed attorney and still own this car.  For a first car, it was very affordable sports coupe (base at under $20K).  I have the ESi version which has a lot more comfort features than the base model and a 140 hp DOHC engine.  Looking back, I just wished I purchased the TSi AWD version!  It has 210 horses under the hood and all-wheel-drive.  What kind of sports car nowadays has that for under $24K???

Anyway, you have to remember that this car has a sports tuned suspension.  It's a little bumpy on the road and can be tiring on long drives.  But the tighter suspension means better handling and roadfeel.  Basically it's a fun sports car at a value price.

The styling is a little more aggressive than its Mitsubishi Eclipse counterpart and more affordable.  Otherwise, they are mechanically identical.  In my opinion, it looks a heck of a lot better than the new style Eclipses too.  The only thing that might be a little awkward on the styling of the Talon is the rear spoiler on the 96's and 97's.  It is a little high, so it blocks your rear view a little bit.  And I do not recommend having full size adults sitting in the back seat for prolonged periods of time.  It's a bit cramped back there.  Otherwise, I don't have any complaints.

Good quality Chrysler/Mitsubishi parts and engine.  It's been over 5 years and no major problems yet.  Just make sure to keep up the scheduled maintenance and this car will probably run forever.  This is a good buy for sure.
