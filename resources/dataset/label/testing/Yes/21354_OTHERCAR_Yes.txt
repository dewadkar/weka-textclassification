            I recently purchased a new &quot;Year-End&quot; 1999 Toyota Camry CE.  This is the first Toyota vehicle I have ever owned.  When I had decided to replace my aging '89 Mazda MPV which had served me well for more years that I care to count, I decided that I would check into the Camry, Maxima, Mazda 626, and possibly some American brands.  I happened to stop at the Toyota dealer first and it ended up being the only stop made that day.  I have many years of automobile experience by having been in the industry for about 16 years.  I had always heard that the Camry was a quality built car with high owner satisfaction and was eager to see for myself.  After the roadtest,and all the paperwork the Camry was mine.  I quickly found this vehicle to be all that I expected and more.  It was quiet, comfortable on long trips, great gas mileage, (around 34 mph with a very able 4 cyl. engine.), and solidly built.  Its looks are pleasing, but not radical.  It will seat 5 people in comfort, with the fifth person being a small person or child and a large trunk.  Remember this; No vehicle is any good if the dealer or manufacturer will not stand behind it. Every vehicle will need the service of your dealer at some point in time.  Before purchasing the vehicle of your dreams, check out the reputation of the dealer, the service shop, talk to customers of theirs, the BBB etc.  You should spend time at the dealership listening &amp; watching them work with customers both on the sales floor and the service area.<br><br>
