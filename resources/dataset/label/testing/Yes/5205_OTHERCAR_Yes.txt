            I am tired of buying film, paying for developing, and only receiving half of my pictures back.  I finally put an end to that cycle.  I recently purchased a Fuji DX-10 digital camera and I have been a picture snapping fool ever since.  

	To be honest, I had no idea what to look for in a digital camera when I went shopping.  I went to my local electronics store and started browsing.  I noticed many different cameras.  Some under $300 and others well over that.  I noticed the Fuji DX-10.  It was reasonably priced, at $280 it was the second cheapest on the shelf, and it seemed like a nice camera for me to start out with.  So I continued to peruse the information on the box like I was some kind of camera aficionado.  It stated that it has 850,000 square pixels.  I did not know if that was good or bad.  I understood the automatic flash and optical viewfinder.  I also understood what it meant by built-in LCD monitor and live video output.  But what did daylight sync, slow sync mean?  Well it sounded good, so I bought it.

	Once home I inserted the 4-AA batteries and 2MB SmartMedia Card.  The card is like a floppy disk, but a lot smaller and it will hold up to 2MB of pictures on it.  I was now ready to start shooting.  Without even reading the instructions I was able to point, click, and review the picture.  With the aid of the LCD on the back of the camera you can view the picture you want to take and any pictures you have already taken.  This allows you to erase any that you may want to overwrite.  You cannot do that with a conventional camera.  Once the film has been exposed, that�s it.  A few other niceties you have are that you do not have to worry about focusing or ensuring the flash is on; both are automatic.  

	Some extras that come with the camera are of course the software for editing pictures, made by Adobe, and, on the camera itself, you have the ability to use 7 kinds of effects.  The Adobe editing software is probably the best I have ever used.  It is like having your own darkroom on your computer.  It allows you to resize, distort, add backgrounds, make it look old, remove blurs, and it even comes with templates such as fake money that you can put your face in and print out.  The effects on the camera are slim (allows you to show a slimmer version of the subject you are shooting), wide (opposite of slim), convex lens (applies a fish-eye lens to the center of the photo), concave lens (opposite of convex), and then you have silver, gold, and sepia.  These last 3 features allow you to view the subject in silver, gold, or sepia tones.  I have tried them, but cannot, for the life of me, figure out why I would need them.  
	
	Now that you have photos on the camera, you need to put them on your computer.  There are 2 ways to go about this.  The camera itself comes with a serial cable to connect to the computer.  Transferring files via a serial cable is a long process, depending on the size and number of files being transferred.  I shelled out an additional $80 and purchased a FujiFilm Image Memory Card Reader.  This is like a removable floppy drive that plugs in to your USB port.  You remove the SmartMedia card from the camera and insert it like a floppy disk in to the Card Reader, open �Windows Explorer� on your computer, and click and drag the files to where you want them.

	So far I have been very pleased with my purchase.  I have probably taken more photos in the last month than I did my entire time stationed in Korea.  And since most of my family members have computers, it is too easy to e-mail the photos to them.  No money out for undeveloped photos that take 3 weeks to get back anyway.
