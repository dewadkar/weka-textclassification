            As it was approaching time for me to go shopping for my first car, I wanted nothing more than a Jeep Wrangler. I had wanted one ever since I was little riding around in my Barbie Power Wheels Jeep. I looked at some used ones, but the redesigned shape of the '98 caught my eye. The Jeep Wrangler is a perfect car if you love something fun and sporty, definitely a good car for teens and young adults. 

The Jeep is a unique vehicle unto itself. It's rugged enough to go offroading, yet quite comfortable inside and drives great on the road. The Jeep is the only Sport Utility Vehicle to offer a convertible top, excluding those cheesy import's that are knock off Wranglers. The Wrangler offers a soft and hard top, a must if you live in a cooler climate. The soft top is convenient for summer to easily take off, but gets a little drafty and cold in the winter monthes. The hardtop looks sleek, but taking it on and off is a job I only like to do before and after the summer. You need some strong guys to help you lift it, too. 

The suspension is nothing of a luxury car, a bit bumpy, but definitely comfortable. The car handles great on dry road, snow, ice, and rain. Not only great for harsh driving conditions, but the Wrangler is a great summer car to take the top down and cruise along the beach. 

The Wrangler is a youthful car, best for young people, because it's a bit hard to get in and out of, but even my parents take it for a spin once in awhile to relive their youth. It's offered in a array of eye-catching colors and also has plenty of options and accessories so you can customize your perfect Jeep.
