            I purchased my 1996 dark green SC2 as my first car after college in 1997.  I knew, at the time, that I wanted a Saturn.  I have always had a &quot;thing&quot; for companies that strive for superior customer service.

Saturn, which has been historically known for their customer service, seemed like the obvious choice.  I chose to purchase from the Danvers, Massachusetts site and I was shoved off with all the usual Saturn fanfare.  However, that is pretty much where it ends.

When I bought my Saturn, I remember seeing a &quot;used car pledge.&quot;  I had purchased a 1996 Saturn in 1997.  According to their pledge, they said that they would contact you about your car in 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after you purchased it...just to make sure you were happy.  To this day, I have yet to receive a phone call.  Anyway, I have noticed that when I have brought the car in, my warranty never picks up the tab(Wasted money).  I also notice, that they never seem to have the time to service my car.  When I bring it in, they always say that I need to keep it there for a few days(Even for an oil change).  

The very first time I ever brought my car in to be serviced, I received it back washed and with a few mints.  However, over the years, this service has deteriorated.  The last time I brought it in, the car was not washed, there were no mints, and there was a black oily film on my armrest and steering wheel.

I will not be purchasing a new Saturn when I buy my next car in a few months.  I would rather buy it from a Car company that is know for little customer service, because at least then, I am getting what I paid for.
