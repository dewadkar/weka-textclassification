            Large VAN for a family of 2 or more kids, lots of room, it is hard for the kids to reach each other � you know what I mean. Very comfortable for the adults (go with Captain seats and go with lather) front and back. 

This is not a sports car, but with the 3.8 liter engine (recommended) you have enough power to pass or tow (never tried it my self). The car (van) has very good handling for it�s size � say compared with an SUV. You have split air, which is needed in a car this size. Lots of gizmos (garage door opener, lots of buttons I have not figured yet) and a trip computer that can tell you time, distance, fuel level, miles til' empty and so on.

Best feature: TWO sliding doors on both sides. Draw back: windows on side (back doors) do not open, and windows on back back (last row) only tilt.
