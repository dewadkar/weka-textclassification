            I am a Senior US Army Officer serving in Germany.  I was not sure if the time was right to buy this car.  After 9/11 I decided that now is the time.  I am so very happy that I did.  A dream has been fulfilled and I can't believe that it is really true.  This car is very, very fast.  I have driven it at 150MPH+ on the German autobahn, although I will admit that I was just testing it.  No matter what the supposed limitations (i.e. publications or speed governer) are, this car has driven fully maxed out on my speedometer.  It handled very well and very stable.  I cannot believe it.  As a child I always wanted a 1967 Jaguar XKE Series 1 Roadster.  Obviously owning a new one now will never happen.  However, the 2002 BMW Z3 3.0i Titanium Silver with Black Soft top and sport package and available options has fulfilled my dream.  This is "the" classic roadster, no matter what, there is nothing on the market that matches this.  I love the way it purrs when you start up the engine.  I love the way the soft top stores away easily.  I love the quickness of the clutch and manual transmission.  Most of all though, I really love pulling away from snotty Germans in their oversized Mercedes that hate looking at an American leaving them behind.  Lastly, what finally convinced me to buy this car now is that BMW has screwed up their 2003 model line and is replacing the Z3 with the new Z4.  If you haven't seen the Z4's spy photos, then you should.  If you think the rounded style of the Audi TT is what you like, then have at it.  Otherwise, 2002 will be the defining year for the classic sports car, the BMW Z3, the same as 1967 was for the Jaguar Series 1 XKE Roadster.  There are no more 2002 BMW Z3 3.0i's being manufactured.  If you want a classic, then you need to find one that is not sold and buy it before it is too late.
