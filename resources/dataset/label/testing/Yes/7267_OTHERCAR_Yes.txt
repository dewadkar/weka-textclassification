            I upgraded from a Mavica, where I had to carry a big camera, and multiple floppy disks.  So, I decided I'd go smaller, and easier (since we found a big camera was a barrier to actually carrying it around).

I've had this a week, and wow is it feature packed.  I've used only the point and shoot fatures, and it takes great pictures.  4 Megapixel, and every type of setting change imaginable.

Storage:
I chose this camera only for the SD storage, as many of my other devices use it.  So I have multi-uses for these expensive 256 and 512MB cards.  I'm still amazed at how small these cards are.  In 1600x1200 mode, I can fit 500 pictures at the same size as my thumb, and about 2MM thick (on a 256 MB card).  Included is a 16MB card, which can hold about 30, so I would suggest getting a larger card.

It stores quickly, and can be retrieved off the card a variety of ways, USB from the cam or inserting the card into another device for retrieval.

Features:
My Sony didn't have any features, so I am a little overwhelmed by the advanced features here.  You can manipulate the ISO, super-long exposures, aperture levels.  Red-eye reduction.  Speaking of the flash, it is a little weak, but TONS better than my Sony, which washed everything out.

Software:
The software included has lots of features one would expect for manipulation.  The alteration of movies is lacking in features, however.

Movies:
Takes great movies, 35 secs in length (presumably the size of the cache to write to the SD).  The audio recorded from these is limited in value.  I'm not sure why as of yet.

Size:
I can't believe how small this is, and how they fit all these features in here.  The zoom is great, the built in lens cap rocks, and it's super-easy to use.  This is why the LCD is so small, it's a little too-small, but I guess you can't have it both ways!

Long Exposures:
In Macro mode, and several zoom modes (this thing has a great zoom 7.5X), the exposure is so long, that you can't take a jitter free picture w/o a tripod.  It tells you about it with its little jittery-hand icon, but that doesnt help you when you are out and about.  This doesnt happen in "normal" shots, only in extreme close-ups, or with wierd light combos, combined with a long zoom.

Easy-to-twist-dial
Many other users hace complained about the settings dial being too easy to twist.  This hasn't happened to me, but I could see this happening, doens't seem a big deal to me.

Battery life:
Included is a lithium battery, and I have some ni-mh AA batteries.  The battery life is pretty good so far, I haven't run out yet, and I've taken about 100 pics and a few movies, and the indicator hasn't budged.  I also like the fact that if you are really in trouble, you could use a standard AA battery (even though it says not to), but if you're desperate...
