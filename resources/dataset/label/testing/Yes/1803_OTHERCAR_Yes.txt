            First off, there are a number of opinions in this category about older Cutlass models.  Apparently the brainiacs who posted those comments failed to realize this was supposed to be about the '99 Cutlass and didn't see the other categories.  There's a world of difference between the '99 and those other Cutlasses.  The '99 model introduced in '98)is based on the Chevy Malibu sedan and comes in two trim levels, the GL and the upscale GLS.  Mine is the GLS model and includes all the options except sunroof.  

At $17,000 including leather, power everything, and CD/cassette player, I consider this to have been one of the best automotive values of its day when we purchased it.  The car has performed much better than expected and now has 54,000 miles on it.  Other than a minor electrical problem and a coolant leak (both easily fixed), I have had no major trouble with it.  The Cutlass has turned out to be much more dependable than the '95 Taurus I traded in.  My only other gripes are that the OEM tires wore out much too quickly, and I had to replace the original front disc brake pads at 36,000 miles.  

Sadly GM no longer produces this car.  Oldsmobile dropped it in 2000 because it took sales away from the Intrigue (which is also a good car), and now GM has dropped Oldsmobile (it should have dropped Buick instead, but that's another story).
