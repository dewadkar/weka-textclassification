            i love my dodge caravan. once broken in at 1000 miles the gas consumption is suprisingly low. it is just not a mini van but can act as a truck for hauling. no more borrowing friends truck to get the item you purchased home. the seats snap out in a flash. plenty of room for the grandkids when they come to visit. i have owned this van for a year and am completely satisfied with it. not one little problem has arisen. never will i go back to the standard car. i am short but i am able to see everything  in front of me. no more running off curbs. any one can purchase a van and will enjoy it. there are only two of us but with all its advantages, we love going on trips now. we are not half as tired because of the smoothe handling of the vehicle. as for what i hate about my van, i can honestly say NOTHING. just go on in a test drive a van today and you will not want to leave without it. just remember to keep the oil changed. any vehicle will be good to you if you are good to it.<br><br>
