            November of 1998, and I love it. it is a Limited 2 wheel drive. has all the bells and whistles except that it is two wheel drive. if i could do it all over again, i would spend the couple of thousand extra and give up about a mile per gallon to have that feature.

 my friends all said, &quot; you don't need 4wd. are you gonna take your new $30k vehicle off road? are you gonna take it out in the snow?&quot; well, at the time it made sense, but every once in a while, i get the urge to &quot;get crazy&quot; and i'm a little scared without the extra wheels pulling.

 it drives good, is quiet, and has plenty of room for my family of 4. it is also nice to be able to see over the traffic flow, which i think, makes it safer.  while i've heard that the jeep is a better deal,(another buddy bought one), i guess i'll find out in a few years when it comes time to trade it in. the 4-runner is rated very high on resale value.  <br><br>
