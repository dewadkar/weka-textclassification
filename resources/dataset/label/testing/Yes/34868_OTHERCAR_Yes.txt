            It was time to turn in our lumbering full size conversion van, vintage '92, that had hauled a summers worth of &quot;stuff&quot; from Florida to New York year after year.  The Odyssey's report drew our interest because the back seat folded completely out of site to form a large flat cargo area. We looked at the two other minivans that had similar features, but kept going back to the Odyssey. 
 We are so glad we did.  It is so much easier to drive than our old full size van, but still has a tremendous storage capacity.  The seats are the most comfortable of any mini van we tried out.  We did have lots of luxury in our old van, and my arthritis needed comfort for those long hauls.  The Odyssey more than meets my needs. 
 It is so quiet that I sometimes wonder if the engine stopped.  The road noise is muted and you only hear the engine when you stomp the pedal to the floor. 
 We had to have the windows tinted because there is a great surface area of glass.  Being in Florida, the large amount of window area would cause glare and extra &quot;heat&quot;.  The tinting solved the problem without interfering with the expansive view of the road. 
I'm so glad we found the extra money it cost, because it is everything I dreamed of and so much easier to drive, maneuver, and park. It is our wonderful, new Gentle Giant.
 I can't wait to haul our kids, grandkids, and their dogs around the Great Lakes this summer.<br><br>
