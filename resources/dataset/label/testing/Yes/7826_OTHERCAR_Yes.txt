            I bought my new little Nissan 240SX in 1993 because it was a cute little sports car with good gas mileage (20-27 depending upon conditions)that drove fast.   With the windows down and the moon roof up, I felt as if I were driving a Ferrari.  There is something strange about driving this car that I am not the only one to notice; you will be zicking down the freeway at what feels like 65-70 MPH, but take a look at your speedometer and you're really going 90!!!  How this works I'm not sure, but I think it really says something for how smoothly this car rides.  Many cars begin to shake and shimmy at 80.  

I have now had this car for nearly 8 years.  Now, 300,000+ miles later, I consider him a dependable friend.  This little guy has been good to me through the years of commuting 180 miles round trip daily and trips across the country from California to Minnesota every summer.   I have never had any MAJOR problems with it that aren't routine.  I think the most major things that have had to be replaced are the clutch and the water pump.  

The outside body of the car still looks fair, but unfortunately, car doors, shopping carts, and debris from the road gravitate towards it, so it has a few dings.  One major reason that they cause the damage they do is because the car did not come standard with any sort of protective molding on the doors.  In hindsight, I wish I had put on my own a long time ago.

The interior has held up relatively well, too.  The black dashboard and steering wheel have begun to fade a bit, but my windows are not tinted and I live in CA, so it's to be expected.  The carpet is pretty stained, but then again, I have a kid and it's light grey!  The upholstery on the seats has been very durable and hides most stains well.  There is only one spot wearing thin and that is beside my steering arm.  Heck, after steering 300,000 miles, I would expect it from cloth upholstery.

At the time that I bought this car, I was the only one I had to worry about...no husband, no kids.  I am now married, and my husband, who is 6'2&quot; doesn't fit in my car very well.  I have to pop up the moon roof for his head to fit.  However, I am 5'0&quot; tall and it fits me perfectly!  When I first had my son and had to maneuver him into the back seat, I had a heck of a time, but I have now got a system down and that really isn't a complaint of mine anymore.  There are windows on the sides in the back so he can see out quite well.  

If you are a relatively small person considering buying a used car, take a look at the 240SX.  From the proud mommy of a great car, you have my word that you'll be impressed.<br><br>
