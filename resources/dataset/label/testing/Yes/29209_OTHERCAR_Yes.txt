            I rented a Dodge Intrepid ES sedan on a short business trip, choosing the car class size because of an anticipated need to carry passengers (some of whom were quite big). Fortunately, I was not disappointed in this aspect.  

EXTERIOR: The Intrepid has a swoopy fastback design that nearly belies its sedan status, with a high back rear deck.  The front end is surprisingly short (this is the famous cab-front configuration) at work, it seems unorthodox but it makes it work. A bright cherry-red color of my car contributed to its sporty look.  

INTERIOR:  The controls and switches were logically laid out and easy to operate.  I liked the black on white dials for its visibility in daytime (turning to opposite when lit at night). I was able to find a comfortable driving position easily with the bucket seats and the tilt steering wheel.  The short hood allows the driver good visibility of the front fenders.  However, the high rear deck makes it a bit difficult to look towards the rear when reversing.  

Accommodations were very spacious, front and back; I was especially impressed with the amount of rear legroom, a blessing when I brought some clients out to lunch.  Trunk space was also very generous as well. The Intrepid has more generous interior room and trunk capacity than, say, the Ford Taurus.   

The interior was all black, with cloth seats.  While I generally like simplicity in terms of design, the all black treatment, including the dashboard, seemed monotonous---could stand a bit of accents in terms of brightwork or color (but that's just my taste).  The shininess of the black plastic dashboard looked a bit cheap---I think this could be improved by going to a matte finish.  There are plenty of convenience features that make life easier such as the cupholders that fold in/out of the front center armrest (as well as the space for your change, cell phone, etc.).

DRIVING IT:  The 2.7-liter V6 engine offered strong acceleration, though I felt that I had to use a bit more pedal effort than in my Maxima; I don't know if the 3.5L engine is really necessary for most normal driving situations unless you have to carry a lot of cargo and people.  Suspension is fairly taught and tuned for more sportiness than the Chrysler Concorde---so if your tastes run towards a softer ride, the Chrysler may be a better choice. Engine is a bit noiser, though, than its corporate cousin. 

Overall, the Intrepid offers very good value for money in terms of accommodations, engine power, features, though I felt it had a bit of "rough edges" in terms of the interior execution and engine refinement.
