            I've had the pleasure of owning one of the best pick up trucks ever made. I have a 1993 toyota T-100  with an eight foot bed. It has a 6 cylinder motor that gives enough power for most anything. I purchased mine used in 1997 and it had 117,000 miles on it for a mere $9,000.00 dollars. Did I forget to mention it was a four wheel drive also. 

Im not one for taking it off road and  &quot;mudding&quot; but I have had the need for the four wheel drive several times and was very impressed. I use mine mostly for construction and find the eight foot bed very useful when picking up materials. As for the load capacity, I believe its rated for a half ton but I personally have hauled 10 squares of shingles which weighs in about 2,100 ils in it with no problem.

 I now have about 160,000 miles on it and it still runs great and is a very comfortable ride. I have only recently had to replace the clutch and starter. Other than that I have had no problems. I have always had toyota trucks and think they are the most dependable trucks out there,<br><br>
