            I began looking for a digital camera several months ago.  My demands were not terribly specific but I knew I wanted something that had resolution good enough to take photos that looked like the real thing.  I wanted a good optical zoom, and enough manual features to do as much as I could with a traditional camera.  What happened?

I didn't actually take a picture with it until I brought it home.  It was fairly easy to use, I could figure it out without the instruction manual.  You can't mess things up that badly just by pressing random buttons, so that's good.  I took some shots of my house in medium/low resolution.  The results were astounding.  I hooked it up to my computer and displayed them on the monitor, it was amazingly realistic I felt like I was really in the room the picture was of.  The next day I took a trip to Newport, RI to view the houses.  I printed the photos on my HP Deskjet 895cse on semi-gloss paper, and they were magazine quality.

I can't overstate how much more convenient this camera was than any traditional camera I've every used.  I usually used an old Olympus, with a light meter, an exposure and shutter speed adjustment with manual loading.  I liked working without a flash, because a flash washes everything out with front lighting.  With a light meter I could know whether or not it would come out right.  So when I went looking for a digital camera, I was looking for something that could work without a flash without guessing games like on a "point and shoot" camera.

The spectacular quality 2x3 inch LCD screen leaves nothing up to chance.  You see the picture before you take it.  If you take it and you don't like, you just delete it without wasting film or in this case space on the memory stick.  Like a traditional you can adjust the exposure (F-stop) if you like and there are four automatic exposure settings.  You can also adjust the shutter speed and focus (the camera does everything automatically if you don't adjust any of the settings, including the flash).  The zoom is 3x optical and 6x digital.  Optical zoom is far superior because it magnifies the actual image rather than a digital rendition of the image.

The DSC-s70 is great if you want to take professional quality photos that are good enough to put on the wall in a frame or perhaps an archive or such.  799 was only the price for the camera itself.  Naturally you need a decent computer and a good printer to make this thing worth your while.  

This camera is not for you if you're planning on using it to take a family car trip that you would normally pack twenty rolls of film for.  Why?  First of all the memory stick that comes with the camera holds only 8 megabytes, which is nothing.  A 32 meg memory stick costs 70 or 80 dollars, so if you want to take twenty rolls worth or more, you best bring a laptop and transfer your pictures to that.  Unlike film, memory sticks are expensive and not available at the corner drug store.  This is a high-end camera, and there are cheaper ones out there.  If you just want to take a picture of your kid's birthday party, you don't need this unless you plan on publishing it.

What's so great about this camera?  The quality for the price (it's worth it), the ease of use (you don't have to be a professional or a gadget wizard), the battery charges fast and holds its charge (the Infolithium lets you know its charging progress and how many minutes of life you have left on it), mpeg movie mode (expect them to be short), built in microphone, 3x optical and 6x digital zoom, true-to-life images, ultra high-res, better pictures than a good traditional camera, LCD and viewfinder, you get the picture.

And now for the down side, I only have one gripe.  In order to take a picture you have to press the shutter button half way down, wait a second and then push it all the way down.  If your subject isn't going anywhere (such as a mountain) this isn't a problem, but say you're on a whale watch and that humpback flips up its tail for a second, you might miss it.  This didn't bother me that much because I bought to use for landscape and other stuff that doesn't move.  However, this would be a much bigger pain to a fashion photographer or a sports photographer where timing is critical.

All said, this is an excellent camera and I'm so glad I bought it.
