            When I first bought my Grand Caravan, I had just gotten rid of a conversion van and was very skeptical.  I bought this Caravan and we have had it for 4 years now and have had no major trouble with it. It is used as a work vehicle, and driven a lot.  It is extremely reliable, it has started everyday, int he winters here it can get well below zero. If there is a down side to this van, it is that there have been a lot of recalls.  The worst one I expierenced was the pump in the ABS, but it cost me nothing because it had been recalled. the seats can be difficult to get back in if you do not take your time. I love to take it camping with three kids and both dogs and all of the stuff we carry.  I grocery shop once a month and we have no problems loading it all in the caravan.  So, if you are looking for a excellent family vehicle, good on gas and reliable the Caravan is worth looking at.<br><br>
