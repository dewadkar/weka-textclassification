            I needed a comfortable car for driving adults.  I spent most of my time traveling with clients and needed something that looked sharp, rode comfortably and could fit a large number of people.  

I settled on a new 98 Lincoln Navigator.  Appearance wise I think it's a very classy &quot;truck&quot; to drive.  The dash is sharp looking.  The sound system is terrific.  My clients always boasted about how comfortable they were.  The leather seats seemed to form to your body and gave plenty of room. The passenger seats can fit an adult with legs fully stretched. 

The built in cooler between the two rear seats always came in handy. Simply put ice in the lower portion and you can store up to 2 six packs of canned or bottled drinks in the cooler.  It is easy for the children to reach on long trips as it is directly in the middle of the vehicle. 

<b>Nifty Features</b>
-On the front of the steering wheel there are buttons to control both air and audio equipment. 
- From the middle seats you can change the settings on the radio.  This is not necessarily a positive feature as I discovered when my children mutanied over the chosen radio station.
-Overhead in the front seating of the car is a place for your garage remote.  You can click the outside of the compartment to activate your remote because it is positioned to impress the clicker on your remote.  There is also a compartment for your sunglasses.
-You can set your seating and mirror positions for two people.  I am on setting #2.  When I open the car locks with my automatic remote the seat and mirrors return to my comfort settings.
-The electric door controls can be programmed to exclude use by anyone but the driver.  This is helpful for when the children are playing the window up/window down game. The child safe adjustment will prevent little ones from opening doors while the car is in motion.
-Behind the front seats are netted compartments to store books or baby toys. 
-The CD player and compartment has plenty of storage. 

 One problem I've had is how it handles in the rain.  I feel very insecure stopping in it and when I take close turns it just doesn't seem to handle as well as some other suv's that are smaller in size.  A few of the bells and whistles broke right away.  The driver side mirror doesn't defog automatically anymore and the storage piece for my garage control fell off the ceiling on my third day of ownership.  Every inch of this vehicle is planned well as far as space is concerned but the &quot;quality&quot; of the features appears to need fine tuning.

Overall I enjoy the look of my Navigator and the comfort, but would not try it in bad weather or on mountain roads.<br><br>
