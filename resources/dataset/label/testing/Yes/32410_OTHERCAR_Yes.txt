            Well i bought the first Si coupe to come to Lokey honda in st.pete fL
and for the money its A great car econmical because of the gas milage
and it is fast but i drive mine hard at times and i noticed at about 13000 miles my clutch started slipping, the dealer didnt want to replace it and this is like at least a 500 dollar job and possibly more if you want a stronger clutch, i read in some magazines they had the same problem
so thats really my only complaint but ive got over twentyone thousand miles on it and other than my clutch which is a serious problem it runs like a champ,ive owned another honda si which was a hatchback and loved it
honda makes a great reliable car, and this is the only problem ive ever had with one. but very comfortable stereo sounds good and its got a nice interior.. 
but i would deffinatly recomend This car.
