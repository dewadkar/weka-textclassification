                Set to be put out of production as early as 2001, the Pontiac Firebird and long-respected Trans Am hopefully will not die a quiet death.  Pontiac's F-body muscle car has everything the modern sports car enthusiast is looking for: V8 power, comfort and convenience, and vicious looks.
     Lift the hood, and you'll find the same LS1 Corvette-based engine found in the Z28 Camaro.  With 305hp and 335 ft-lbs of torque on tap, you're in for the ride of your life.  For all you Bowtie fans, this engine makes the car fly from 0-60 in 5.2 seconds, and thrusts it through the quarter mile in 13.8 seconds at 104 mph.  With faster acceleration than any of its competition [i.e. Ford Mustang GT AND Cobra], the Trans-Am also manages to pull faster times on the race track, as reflected by Car &amp; Driver's August 1999 comparison.
     The most pleasure by far is the throaty rumble of the 345 cubic inch 5.7L V8, and the exhaust note it leaves behind.  With a top speed of 160 mph, nothing in its category comes close to even approaching its ability to cut through the wind, and leave everything in its trails.  Despite weighing in excess of 3400 lbs, it manages a respectable .83 G's on the lateral skid pad.
     The interior is well thought, and controls are within easy reach of the driver.  The gauges are familiar, but are starting to look dated compared to some of the retro-styling of the new imports.  Bucket seats are comfortable, but think twice before putting anyone over 5 feet in the back seats.  They weren't made for regular sized human beings, but rather little kids, and Munchkins from Oz [aka Ross Perot].
     The car feels great at high speeds, due in part to two things: a long 6th gear that allows for great cruising at high speeds, and it's hefty weight which gives it the stability and comfort at high speeds.  It doesn't feel like a cheap tin box, but rather a sturdy sports car.
     So to all of you who really want a true muscle car that will turn heads with its awe-inspiring styling, and tire shredding capabilities, this is the car for you.  Don't wait!  Call now!<br><br>
