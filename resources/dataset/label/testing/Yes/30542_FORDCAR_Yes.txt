            I used to own a 1992 Escort in college, and it was a great car.  It was a 5 speed with the dual overhead cam which made for a very sporty ride.  People were always surprised by the performance, and I was always very pleased with it!  The interior was extremely comfy, with lots of room in the back seat (4 door), pleanty of head and leg room, and the trunk had generous space as well.  I bought it used and never had to fix anything on it (well once I had to replace the battery).  It was a wonderful car, and always reliable and dependable.  If you're thinking about buying a used one in this era, I would strongly recommed that you get one with the cam, you won't regret it.  I loved the car!<br><br>
