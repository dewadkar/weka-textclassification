              We bought our 1995 Intrepid because I fell in love with it and with 2 teenage growing boys that didn't fit into my sports car any more this was perfect and had a perfect price.  The back seat is roomy enough for 3 adults to sit very comfortable.  When traveling an adult can sleep in the back seat almost stretched out. (Mind you I'm 5'2&quot; but, it's still amazes me) I love how it drives smooth and faster than a small car.  
  The downfall of the 1995 (I don't know about other years) is the brake system on the car is the same brake system Dodge uses on the smaller cars.  Oh, it stops, but we have gone through 2 sets of brakes in 4 years. Somehow I don't think that is very good.  The second thing I have a problem with is the back window seal has never fit right.  We've gotten it replaced 3 times and all 3 times it comes loose.  
  Other than that I love it :) <br><br>
