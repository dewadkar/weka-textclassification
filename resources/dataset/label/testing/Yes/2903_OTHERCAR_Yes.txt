            It all started in the 80's, when Honda decided to market a more upscale wing, called Acura, which I might add only exists in North America.  The Legend was a great example, quick, and luxurious.  Then Acura starting going alphanumeric.  Legend became RL, Vigor became TL, the CL was created, but Integra remained.  Sport Luxury started to fade.  The 2nd generation Legend had more horsepower than the RL.  TL and CL were nothing to boast about.  Only the GS-R was a worthy sport luxury competitor.  It's 3rd generation lasted quite a long time, about 7 years.  Then Acura decided to go back to the sport image.  CL Type S, then TL Type S, the introduction of the CL Type S 6 speed.  But for North America, Honda decided to drop the name Integra, and follow suit and introduced a new redesgned, more upscale, luxurious, and faster Integra dubbed the RSX.  It replaces the aging Integra, and does a decent job.

Over at Continental Acura, I recieved an invitation to go drive the RSX Type S, and since I have an Integra, I decided to go see how worthy the replacement is.  After I had the great food, my turn came to drive and take a look at the car, and here are my thoughts.  


The Exterior.
This is thee first thing you see on a car, the outside.  To me, the newly redesigned lines seem very much more freshened, compared to the old lines.  Maybe I'm happy to see an updated car, but to me, the car looks attractive.  However, some people don't like it at all.  It seems to be a love/hate look.  
But look at those rims.  16 inches, finally.  New headlights, and a sharp nose.  I'm thinking this car might be better than I thought. The car looks like luxury.  The door handle.  The first part of a car you touch gives me a lasting impression of what the car may be like.  The operation is smooth, and nice.  I like the way it feels.  Perhaps better things are to come.

I would give the exterior a 8.


Interior.
The second thing you see, as you get into the car.  I noticed its easy to get into.  When you sit in the cabin, it feels solid.  It is just a different feel from my Integra.  

The quality is different now, it doesn't quite scream out "HONDA PARTS BIN!!".  Materials are quality and operation is smooth.  Dials turn nicely, and gauges are easy to read.  The wipers are easier to work.  R & D did their homework.  Everything is in reach, and nothing confusing is added.  My favorite part, the smaller radius steering wheel.  I feel like I'm in a car thats meant to turn.  It gives the car a sporty feel, in my opinion.  And look at those gauges, they are very clean, very different from the old Integra.  I feel like I'm in a $35,000 car.  

Comfort is supurb.  The seats are GREAT.  Theres more side support than my Type R!  I can drive forever in these seats.  These leather seats.  Which aren't slippery as I imagined they would be.  I stayed planted during our test drive, and I was impressed.  I had plenty of room too.

The audio system was decent, better than the Integra.  But still, it was not up to my standards.  I didn't like it, as if you wanted it up, it wouldn't go up.  Besides, I wanted to hear the hum of the engine. 

The shifter is great too.  I drive the Type S with the optional titanium shifter, and it fit very nicely in my hand.  The stand one also fits nicely, and I think I prefer the standard one to the titanium one.  

Interior, I give it a 9.  Much, much, much more luxury and upscale than my car.  


Engine
2.0 liter, DOHC i-VTEC, with 200 hp.  New, variable timing also.  If you want to know more what VTEC does, e mail me, otherwise I won't bore the rest of you.  In short, this means, you can get small 4 cylinder like gas mileage, but if you want, you can go really fast when you hit it.  Its like 2 engines in one.  Once the change over occurs, it feels different.  However, this engine is much smoother than the B18C series, from the Integras.  Its more quieter too.  For a luxury coupe, this is a very fitting engine.  I couldn't tell it was on at some times.  
It may be low on torque, but compared to the Integra, when you hit it it goes.  However, still, to get maximum power, you have to drive it like you stole it.  As with the Integra, and other 4 cylinder power plants, you have to rev high to get some power.  However, this engine does go when it makes power.  I like it.  

I rate the engine a 8.0.  Sure, it makes more power, but its not as exciting as the Integra.  But then, I will also guess that for luxury drivers, this doesn't matter.  Plus, it doesn't feel quite as powerful as the Type-R motor.  Maybe when 220 RSX Type R comes here, but right now, it doesn't. 

The transmission is nice.  6 speeds is rewarding, as at crusing speed the RPM is much lower than in my car.  I was unable to see if a shift at redline will keep you in VTEC, but I do know when you do shift at redline you will hit the gear your going for.  As Hondas are reknown for shifter quality, this follows.  Throws are short and percise.  With the triple cone synchros, gears are grabbed smoothly.  But, with all cable linkage shifters, it just doesn't feel perfect to me.  I prefer mechanical linkage, in my Integra, compared to the Cable.  It doesn't feel good.  

With that 6th speed, and the ability to hit your gear, I give transmission a 9.  


Now... The fun part.  Driving Experience.
I took the car out, first thing I noticed was how easy clutch engagement was.  Its short, and very easy to work.  The car rides smoothly, much smoother than the Integra.  No body panel rattles, everything seems more upscale with attention in craftsmanship.  On a relaxing drive, the car goes very smoothly.  Shifts occur smoothly, and everyone is relaxed.  
Then you pick it up a notch.  I found a parking lot, and did some weaving.  One thing I noticed, was the steering ratio was slow.  I had to crank the wheel to get the car to turn.  I feel a bit disconnected with the road.  I loop around, ready to get back on the road, and I let it lose.  1st gear, gone, 2nd gear, perfect engagement, car flies.  You can't hear the engine as much, but the car covers ground pretty quick.  Brakes are also very good, as I had to slow down for a car infront of me.  The pedal feel is very good.  

So what do I think of the experience.  The ride is smooth, luxurious, very much living up to the Acura name.  However, sometimes I wonder what demographic this car was aimed at.  The Integra attracted young buyers.  What about the Type S?  I think its meant for an older crowd.  The smoothness and quiet feeling was nice, but I want to hear the engine scream and I wanted to feel the bumps in the road, to KNOW this car would turn.  It turned decently, but not as well as I thought it would.  Its those new MacPherson struts....

I say my comments, perhaps due to the fact I am used to the harshness of the Type R. The Type S is very good, I like to think of it as the luxury version of the Type R.  Its smooth and quiet, and it feels like I'm driving a smaller BMW.  For the average person, I think you will love this car.  It can go fast when you want it to, and it has very good road manners, when compared to others in its class, like the Celica.  So for you people, I give the driving a 8.5.

Now, for the performance fanatics, stray from the Type S, wait for the Type R.  The car is no fun.  Its too quiet, its way too smooth.  The steering response is not fun, and you really have to crank the wheel to get the car to turn, compared to the Integra Type R.  With 5 more hp and gobs more torque, I have seen 0-60 times average, towards the 7's.  Quicker than a GT-S, quicker than an old GS-R, but not good enough.  The car doesn't have the, "I'm ready to handle ANY turn, fly through at any speed, and scream my lungs out" feeling.  Its more of a, "long day at work, rejoyce the relaxing drive home", or, "Honey, want to go out for a drive?".  For the hardcore enthusiasts, I give the car a 6.  Wait for the Type R.  

To finish up, who do I recomend this car to?  To simply put it, anyone who enjoys a nice drive on the weekend, who needs a daily driver with comfort and luxury.  This is your car.  It is easy to drive, and for the weekends, you can turn it up.  It has a sporty feel, and it rides better than a Celica.

For the autocrosser, and the track person, stray from this car.  Sound dampening, lack of aftermarket, not quite as razor sharp steering response, lack of road feel does not do this car good.  Wait for the Type R.  I had a hard time coming to this judgement, as the car does feel very sporty, but its not quite as punch packing as a Type R.  With word of release in a year, why not wait?

Overall, I like this car.  It is something I can drive everyday, to and from school, something I can enjoy on the weekends, for the occasional drive just for the enjoyment.  Its something I can drive future kids to and from school, something I can take my girlfriend out in and make a good impression.  For the track days though, I'll take the Type R.
