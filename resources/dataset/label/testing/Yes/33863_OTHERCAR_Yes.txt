            I swore I would never drive a minivan.  Ever.  Pardon me a moment while I eat my words... 

Okay, so that was before I had two kids.  Picture a small compact car with two carseats crammed in the back -- NOT a good thing. 

We bought our Villager used and we are so glad we did.  Although other vans are ranked very highly by reviewers (such as the Honda Odyssey), we couldn't justify spending as much on a minivan as we would an SUV.  Thus, the villager was a much more realistic and affordable option.

<b>Seating</b>
*  Our van has the leather seating option, which thrills me.  I have never had leather in a car before and I love it.  Not only is it very comfortable and looks nice, but it is much easier to clean up after my children.  If a child spills juice or spits up on upholstery, it soaks in and smells and you have to scrub like the dickens to get it out.  With leather, I just wipe it up!

*  With the push of a button, the front seats can be adjusted electronically for lumbar support, height, and tilt. This is great for me because I am quite short and have trouble reaching the pedals in many vehicles.  Not a problem in the villager. 

*  The middle seats consist of two captain's chairs, which can be moved (or even completely REMOVED) to make more room for cargo.  These seats are great for squabbling siblings who like to play the, "Mom, he's touching me!" game.  Now, they each get their own little seat.

*  The rear seat is a bench, but it can also be removed for additional space.  Admittedly, I can't remove these seats myself because they are too heavy.  My husband says it's not bad, but who knows if he's just playing the part of tough guy?

<b>Interior Features</b>
*  There are heating/cooling vents in the back and middle of the van, as well as the front.  The rear passengers can control their vents independently of the front passengers.  

*  There are radio controls in the rear which allow passengers to turn off the speakers and use headphones (fabulous for teenagers!)

* This van has plenty of space.  There is a storage bin under the passenger seat, pockets in the backs of the front seats, a bin for CDs, and a nice little cubby next to the steering wheel where I like to keep my sunglasses.  There are also plenty of drink holders.

*  Additionally, our van is the "LX" luxury model which has a CD player, cruise control and a sunroof, all of which work very well.  

<b>Engine</b>
This van has a V6 engine for extra acceleration and towing capabilities.  A mechanic told me that the engine is really a Nissan engine, which is a very good and reliable engine.  He said they consistently get over 200,000 miles on them.  Our van currently has 130,000 miles on it and seems good for a lot more.

<b>MPG</b>
We seem to get about 18-21 mpg on average, which is really quite good, especially for a minivan with a V6 engine.

<b>Maneuverability</b>
This van seems a bit shorter than some other vans on the market and it handles more like a car.  It rides well and has good suspension.  It's very easy to park and has a good turning radius.  However, I can't see where the front of the van ends, so I never know how far away I am...

<b>Exterior</b>
The Villager may not be the sportiest looking thing around, but then again, it's not meant to be an SUV.  It is better looking than many vans out there (aka, the Jellybean Previa.  Ugh).  There is a standard luggage rack as well.  The rear door opens upwards, which can be very awkward if you are unloading something in a garage with the garage door closed.

<b>Repairs</b>
The guts of this van are packed in quite tightly and it is very hard to get at them.  This means that it's difficult to do any repairs yourself, and that auto mechanics are going to charge you a bit more for labor.

We do have a few repairs to make on this van, but nothing serious or out of the ordinary.  Just the usual things that any vehicle will need after normal wear and tear, such as belts and filters and the like.  

<b>In Summary</b>
I am glad we chose to purchase a Villager and I would do it again.  It certainly makes life with children quite a bit easier.
