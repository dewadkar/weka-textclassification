            If you are looking for a 3+ megapixel camera, which is what experts seem to be recommending as the minimum for truly film-quality images, then strongly consider this model or the Kodak DX3700, which are the cheapest in this megapixel class. 

The DX3700 has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about $100, so I agonized over paying extra for the DX3900, but I'm extremely happy with it nonetheless. The autofocus is the best I've had on any point-and-shoot camera, extremely accurate under all light conditions weather your standing in the moon light or under a bright sun; I find there are few wasted shots, even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones. 

There seem to be only two meaningful differences between the cameras: (1) the DX3700 zoom is only digital (i.e., electronic), but the DX3900 zoom is both digital and "optical," so the physical lens also has a zoom, which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital zoom; and (2) the DX3700 has 8MB internal storage plus buy-your-own removable Smart Media cards, which apparently are favored in Japan/Europe, while DX3900 has no internal MB and buy-your-own removable CompactFlash cards, which are used more in USA, but price per megabyte (MB) storage is virtually the same (approx. $1/MB) for either medium. Clearly, if you have a limited budget, the DX3700 is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures, but with next cheapest camera in the 3+ megapixel class currently around $500, even the DX3900 remains a good deal if you want a better zoom and/or this particular storage medium . 

In practice, I have found that the combination of the digital and optical zoom (total 6x) allows for greater flexibility in picture-taking and I suspect the digital zoom alone on the DX3700 (only 3x) would have been less useful; if you take personal photos for posterity this affects photo quality as much as the number of pixels and should be an important consideration. 

Other pluses: the DX3900 is extremely lightweight, but not flimsy, which had worried me, with memories of the old Brownie cameras; indeed, it's small enough to carry in my shirt pocket. It's also a sleek, good-looking camera, with a lens that automatically retracts into a covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off, a useful feature for the careless like me. Don't bother with the proprietary docking station, which is just a plastic tray for $70. The docking station is supposed to be one-touch no-brainer transfer of photos to your computer, but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with a wire. 


The storage of pictures on the 8meg card that comes with the camera. It holds 7 pics at 3.1 megapixels, 15 at 3.1 high compressed, 10 at 2.2 megapixels, 13 pics at 1.6 megapixels, and 23 at .8 megapixel shots. I plan on purchasing the Viking CF128Meg card, as this is the best buy for the compact flash that I have seen.  They could have made this camera at least 2" larger and the LCD viewer is also small.  


Downloading 25-50 pictures seemed to take a minute or less to my computer, which I think is relatively miraculous. The Kodak software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use; Kodak is the Disney or MacDonalds of the photo world and I think even my mom could figure it out. 

Best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for e-mailing, a real time-saver when you want to share photos with others electronically. Also don't let anyone tell you that you need to replace the Kodak paired batteries that come with the camera with Kodak ones; you can use other brands of AA batteries, although the manual says they need to be 1.2 volt (i.e., rechargeable variety) and not the standard 1.5 volt (non-rechargeable) kind; there's little reason not to be rechargeable anyway, which are more cost-effective. In a few years, you'll no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel cameras for the same price, but from what I've read, beyond 3 megapixels, you can't really tell the difference except at huge enlargment sizes (i.e., bigger than 8x11), and most snapshots are only 4x6 or maybe 5x7, so what would be the point? 

So, in sum, this is a very good camera value if you don't want to let once-in-a-lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film-quality 3 megapixel camera prices to drop, yet you don't want to spend what Canon, Nikon and others are charging ($500+).
