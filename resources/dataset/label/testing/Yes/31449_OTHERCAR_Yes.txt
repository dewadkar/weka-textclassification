            Last year, as a poor college student, I was able to purchase a 1992 GMC Jimmy.  I bought it at a repossession auction at a local bank.  It was one of the best purchases I have made.  It helped me travel to and from college with ease.  Not only because it held a great amount of cargo, but also because it made it through rough terrain and weather.  Although filling the gas tank was pricey, I still love that car.  I have never had a problem with the engine or any other mechanical parts of the car.  Driving was easy with this car.  I did not know how to drive a clutch, so luckily the Jimmy was automatic.  It was always a smooth ride. I highly recommend anyone that needs a lot of cargo room, and room for friends purchase a GMC Jimmy.<br><br>
