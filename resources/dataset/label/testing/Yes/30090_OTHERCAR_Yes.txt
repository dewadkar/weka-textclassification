The camera comes with a lot of useful programs to touch up the photos. Photodeluxe is a excellent program that can fix up a photo pretty well, but it crashes a lot. It seems like that program has a lot of bugs in it.

Transferring photos to the computer is simple. Install the software that is provided. Than attach the cord to the computer and the camera. Once that is complete there are two ways to get the photos from the camera. One way is by going to my computer and clicking the camera icon that is located there. The other way is by using Adobe Photodeluxe and using the transferring tool that is located there.

There are a lot of options on the camera like the quality of the photo, size of the photo, color options, and flash on/off. Changing the options is very easy. All that needs to be done is set the dial on the back of the camera to settings and everything can be changed from there.

The batteries only last about 100 shots, but there is the recharger that comes with the camera.

Overall this is an excellent camera, but just make sure your going to use the camera a lot or it's not worth the money that you paid.
