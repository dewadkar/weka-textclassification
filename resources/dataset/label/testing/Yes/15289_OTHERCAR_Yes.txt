            The first time I purchased a digital camera ,a different brand, I was very disappointed. That is until I purchased SONY MVC-81. The quality of the pictures with this camera was far more superior.What is great about  this camera is the ability to review all the pictures instantly and delete unwanted ones.However, there is one problem that needs to be looked at. The programing needs to be simplified somewhat.The ICONS are a little misleading. All considering,however, I recommend it highly.<br><br>
