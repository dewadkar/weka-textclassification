            <b>Even if you</b> are behind the wheels of this truck and get into a crash, I will not worry about you.  You will walk out and start helping the injured in the other vehicle.  That's the impression I got after driving this truck.

<b>The 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche</b> is just one example of what can go well in the American automotive industry.  Manufactured by the largest manufacturing corporation in the world, it is  a great leap forward in the creative areas.  For the past few months, I have been trying to test-drive this superb metamorphosis of a full-size SUV into a full-size pickup.  

<b>Each time</b> I dropped by my local dlealerships, I was always attracted to other trucks, sedans and compact cars on my ever-expanding list of vehicles to test-drive.  But, when I saw that a young couple, colleagues of mine pulled into the parking lot with a brand-new Avalanche, I knew t he time was up.  First, I wanted to wait to verify whether it was their new wheels.  They have been more happy to show this truck to their inner circle. Finally, it was my turn to receive a great tour from them.  Going to lunch in such an attention-grabbing truck has never been so rewarding. 

<b>On a typical Summer day</b> in the San Joaquin Valley of CA, my friend, his wife and I decided to hit the road to a well-frequented corner restaurant.  After they opened the door, I stayed with my mouth open the whole time they were showing me around.  They showed me practically all the big and little features that make this truck impressive.  I remain impressed by all the features, standard safety and security equipment that the automaker included into this feat of engineering and design.

<b>Origins of this Super Truck</b>

<b>The 2002 Chevy Avalanche</b> is based on the Chevy Silverado pickup truck frame.  "The truck's manufacturer is right in boasting that the Avalanche is the only full-size truck on the market that can go from a full-size SUV to a full-size pickup with a protected eight-foot cago box."

<i>Let's take a look at the first things that you may notice on the Avalanche</i>

<b>Sturdy body frame, robust exterior styling,</b> height and smoothness at the same time.  If anything, the automaker's engineering and design teams must have thought all along to make this truck appealing to the consumers who value comfort, security, respect, luxury in a perceivably rugged vehicle that rides like a car.  It sports what is known as "Convert-a-Cab system.  What makes this system stand out is the fact that this full-size truck can adapt to what you, consumers, want and need.  My friends continued their demonstration.  They invited to see the midgate system.  After folding the split rear passenger seat, they unhooked a few handles from the roof of the truck.  As soon as they folded the midgate, you can see the new space which can accommodate longer and larger cargo.  No problem if you are working on your house and you need to haul a few materials from the local Home Depot or Hardware store!  In a matter of seconds, your truck's standard length bed can go from the 5'3' to a whopping, full 8'1".

<b>Is there anything</b> you won't be able to fit in all that space?  Keep in mind that you don't have to worry about unavoidable dings, scratches on the cargo box floor.  Don't worry about sliding materials because you have access to 8 multipurpose tie downs to secure them tightly.  There is more gadget that comes equipped with this full-size truck.

<b>The Avalanche's rear window</b> can be removed and stored on the midgate.  I immediately inquired about whether some of the materials could damage it or break it.  My friends reached down and showed the protection cushion that shields the window.  Everything just snaps down ever so gently.  If you want more open space, you can go ahead and lower down the midgate more.  Enjoy the cool breeze in the back of your head and refreshing the whole truck.  Why not after all? 
 
<b>If  you </b>want to haul tall cargo, you can mess around with the three-piece cargo cover to meet your needs.  If you want to load a refrigerator or a motorcycle, you will have enough space to fit them in the back.  Furthermore, I found out that the bed and tailgate are made of a combination of steel, GM's new PRO-TEC composite and other materials.  The composite is very durable and tends to resist scratches caused by sliding materials.   In addition, the cargo box floor sports a black rubber mat reducing cargo shifting and protecting the body.

If you need a few cold ones, you can get them from one of the top box storage compartments...

<i>Fill her up!</i>

<b>One of the greatest things</b> you will soon observe about this truck is that it has lot of features.  In time,  you will get used to them. I imagine that the first feature you will make great use of is either one of the top box storage compartments on either side of the truck.  Just peek inside to realize that you are dealing with a combined five cubic feet of watertight, lockable storage space for tools, sporting accessories and important valuables such as jewelry etc.  Just decide to fill one top box with ice and dump in some beverages which you will consume when you get to your final destination.  (Remember this:  No drinking and driving!)

<b>How is this ultimate utility vehicle powered?  Let's take a look under the hood.</b>

<i>Let's keep running the numbers</i>

<b>Seating 6 adults comfortably</b>, the 2002 Chevy Avalanche's four doors allow easy entry and exit for family members.  Despite all the features, it is seen as a family car too.  In fact, it drives like one.  Power is generated by a (LM) Vortec 5300 5.4L V-8 engine.  It's transferred to the road through a smooth and reliable shifting 4L60-E Hydra-Matic four-speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive transmission.  It also has great towing and hauling capacity.  My friends' first trip occurred a few days ago when they towed their small RVs (about 1000 pounds) to a campground in Morro Bay, CA.  They said it was just a breeze for them.  It was as if they were not pulling anything.  The Avalanche has a maximum payload of 1,363 pounds and a trailer towing capacity of 8,300 pounds.

On the way back to our workplace, I was given the honor to drive this truck.  I could not help noticing the displays and controls found in the Silverado pickup truck.  Everything is right at my reach.  Analog speedometer, tach, odometer, fuel, water tem, oil pressure and a digital message center are state-of-the-art.  Sitting in the front bucket seats with armrests and a large and cavernous center console, I had the best visibility possible.  Between me and my friend were our cups.  In addition, there is no real driving without music.  The truck's stereo system blasts the lasted hip hop music.

<b>More info:</b>

The base manufacturer's price for the 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche four-wheel drive is $33,245.  Now, there are a lot of options which may push it higher.  

<b>Security System</b>

It has the standard safety and security equipment including daytime running lights, halogen fog lamps, PassLock II theft deterrent system, OnStar Communications system, dual front airbags, seat mounted driver and front passenger side-impact airbags, remote keyless entry, power programmable door locks with key-ignition lockout protection, side door guard beams, full-size spare tire, anti-lock brake etc.  If you happen to have a flat tire, just place your key in the back to lower the spare.  You don't have to be on all fours and get dirty.

<b>Recommendation:</b>

This is a safe truck to purchase for your family.  If you want your spouse to be the queen of the road, place her in one of these UUVs.  You won't have to worry about her any longer once she gets on the road.
