            My brother purchased his 1999 Z-28 about a month after I purchased my 92 Corvette.  I have driven both cars and feel like I can make an unbiased comparison.

To put it quite simply, you cannot buy more performance for the price than with a Camaro.  The only real competition in the same price range is the Mustang GT, and to be honest it's performance is a joke.  The LS1 motor in the Camaro is simply a dream to drive.  It doesn't have quite the low RPM torque that my LT1 motor has, but it doesn't suffer long.  Overall the motor is very smooth and powerful.  It is the ultimate factory sleeper motor.  You could ride around in a Z-28 all day long and never realize the power until the driver nails it.  Most V-8's lack the refinement of the LS1.

There are a few drawback to the Z-28 that I would like to point out.  First and foremost it has a huge blindspot.  Having a passenger to help you look for traffic helps a lot as they have a better view of the hatch than the driver does.  Secondly the seats are terrible.  The driver's seat is alright, but it lacks any side support.  This is fine for straight line, but in any cornering situation one is left grasping for something to hold on to, and finding very little.  The worst seat in the car is the front passenger seat, there is a hump in the floorboard that makes it impossible to get comfortable.  The rear seats speak for themselves, no leg or headroom whatsoever.  It would be fine for children, but for an adult it is not a feasable option for a long trip.

Other than that the interior has a few design flaws.  The LT1 powered Camaro's have a better instrument layout from an ease of use standpoint.  The newer style just looks cheaper, the A/C and radio are not really in a good place as compared to the older interior.  Also for a car without power windows, the window crank is in a terrible spot, impossible to reach without bending over and moving your entire body.

As far as the handling, the Camaro is excellent considering it's size.  It is not as good as my Corvette, but it is not supposed to be.  Again for the price and considering the size of the car you can't expect any better handling from the factory.
