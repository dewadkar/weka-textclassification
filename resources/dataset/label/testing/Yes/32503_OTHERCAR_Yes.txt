            The latest A4 continues Audi's streak of designing award-winning cars that drive well and look and feel great inside and outside.  Automotive journalists have praised Audi for a number of recent designs, including the TT, the allroad, the A4 and the A4 cabriolet. 

This review focuses on the A4 3.0 quattro, but many of my comments will also apply to the A4 1.8 and non-quattro A4s.

The new A4 oozes class and sophistication.  Its wedge shape and clean, taut lines project confidence and modernity, similar a BMW 3 series.  Compare the understated elegance of the A4 to that of the Jaguar X-Type, which seems so desperate for a sense of lineage that it results in a mismash of outdated Jaguar styling elements, or the Cadillac CTS, which screams "Look at me!  Please!  I am Cadillac's last hope for selling a car to someone below the age of 75!"

The interior of the A4 has also been reworked to provide more room and to add additional luxury features (many of which are options that will appeal to many people), such as a self-dimming mirror, multi-adjustible power seats, power rear window shade, heated front and rear seats, 6 CD changer and a trip computer.  Fortunately, Audi did not change the fundamental feel of the interior, which remains a wonderful place to sit, whether you are driving or not.  Audi's combination of high-quality leather, wood, plastic and aluminum sets the benchmark for interior design.  The front seats are comfortable for long road trips and provide just enough support for spirited driving on winding roads.  The rear seats are still a bit snug for more than 2 adults and the seat backs seem to be angled just a tad bit too close to 90 degrees; so, the best way to use the rear seats is for short jaunts around town or for groceries or sports equipment.

The A4 handles extremely well, especially with the optional sport package, which includes a stiffer suspension and 17 inch tires mounted on alloy rims.  The A4 feels firm and steers directly with a bit of understeer at higher speeds.  Under most circumstances, all you need to do is pick a point in the road up ahead, steer into that point, and the car will just follow.  While the A4 doesn't match the effortless feel of a BMW 330i, it comes very close, much closer than let's say, a Mercedes C320 or a Jaguar X-Type, both of which handle nicely as well.

The A4 3.0 also boasts an improved engine, bumped up from 2.8 liters to 3.0 liters, with 220 hp instead of 190 hp from the 2.8 version in the previous A4.  While the car feels a bit faster on the road than the previous A4, the difference is one of degree and not of magnitude.  The culprit is the added weight that the new A4 carries (between 200-300 more lbs) due to the added features and improvements.  The manual transmission may make the best use of the engine because the 5 speed automatic always wants to shift to the next gear before the tachometer reaches the middle of its power curve.  I suppose that you can always stomp on the throttle to improve the cars straightline performance around town, but that would result in even worse gas mileage (I currently get about 20 mpg in mixed city and highway driving).  The continuously variable transmission (CVT) recently developed by Audi makes the car seem faster at times, but is only offered on non-quattro Audis. 

Overall, the new Audi A4 raises the bar a notch in the sports sedan wars.  The bad news is that the price of the A4, which is still a few thousand dollars less expensive than a comparably equipped BMW 3 series, has gone up slightly since the previous iteration.  But, the good news is that consumers now get much more for their money.  For people looking for a solid, sporty, stylish and relatively inexpensive German automobile, the A4 should definitely be on your list of cars to consider. 

Finally, for those horsepower hungry enthusiasts out there, don't despair, a new Audi S4 should be unveiled soon which should provide some competition for the BMW M3.
