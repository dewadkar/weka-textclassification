            This is by far the best car I have owned. Performance, drivability, comfort and status all rolled up into one good looking set of wheels (16in alloys). 

Power
 The Acura CL 2.2 was only in production one year (1997) and was replacing by the 2.3l model. As you may have guessed the 2.2 is the engine size. Acura loaded this particular CL with a 2.2l V-Tec producing 145hp @ 5500rpms and 147ft/lbs @ 4500. This particular Acura is one of the few to have the relatively high torque output, which I must say add a level of excitement to the import-class automobile. And let&#146s not over look the V-Tec or variable valve timing that the Honda Corporation is so famous for. With the kick in around 4500rpms this power plant is made to rev and run, but the suspension isn't exactly race setup (maybe mine is just a little old). Never the less it had plenty of power on hand and the efficiency of a 4 cyl. (I have gotten 32 mpg on one trip, which is amazing; I usually average 29-30). 

Options Options Options!
 Being an Acura it comes standard with tons of great features, lie the V-Tec, wood trim, ac, good sound, and a big chrome "A" that lets everyone know what your driving. As far as factory options go you can upgrade to the 3.0CL or the "S", which is considerably more powerful. On top of that you can also get automatics, leather CD Changer, heated mirrors, moon roof, 16 inch alloys, and a couple more things. 
The real options for this car come not from Acura but from its Honda blood line. Being a Honda product it is a very feasible option for "tuners." So you can get all kinds of after market parts from RAM's and K&N's, to an assortment of spring, to specialized clutches, and turbo charger (only for those with money to burn).

Let&#146s talk interior.
 Bucket seats and kind of a 2+2 thing going on. I love the front seats, they are high backed and come around a little, but they are not full out racing seats. they are also well padded, this car has 100,000 miles on it and they are just like new, it feels awesome to plop down in these cloth seats (I really don't like leather interior, uncomfortable and not sporty) and just cruise. This car seats 2 in extreme comfort and three is ok, but I don't like having more than three people in the car, especially due to the weight limit of 850lbs, which seems low but when you thing about it, the car is a coupe and is build to be lighter. Beryl wood trim and a great factory stereo make it a great ride. 

Feel and Handling
 It just feels sporty, but not like a Corvette, and it feels classy but not like a Caddy. Acura has chosen a very nice ride height and wheelbase for this car, giving it performance and a smooth ride; of course it is not extreme on either end of the spectrum.
 And how does it hold the road? Not as well as I would like it, but there is a source of error. I have a set of continentals on it and I really dislike these tires, the rubber never grips right, and the tread pattern is stupid, I am sure with a change of tires I could gain a large advantage in the corners. But that aside how does it handle? Well doing 90 degree turns I hear a lot of rubber between 25 and 30 and start to drift around 30, any thing higher than that and I am not sure how the car will react. due to its weight it simply can't respond the same way a Miata or an Integra can, but due to the fact that it is considerably smaller that other luxury cars it can out handle and of the big Americans, and probably give some of the Germans a run for their money.
 On the interstate it is a smooth quite ride, provided you don't burn out your exhaust (that was my fault, and I am paying for it now). Relative to a Mazda 626 the ride is superior; it doesn&#146t feel like Japanese engineering. Of course next to my sisters VW Passat VR6 it still feels smooth but it begins to show how truly light it is around 95. (The VW is a really stable car at 120, but also really heavy and sluggish off the line).

What is bad...?
 Well I have the 5 speed and the throw on the shifts is pretty long and that is not the greatest, especially for people learning to drive stick. The only other complaint I have about the car is the rear end, it looks a little funny, but that has actually grown on me, and now I like it. Weird.
