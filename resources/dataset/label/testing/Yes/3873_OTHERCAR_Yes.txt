            When I was pregnant we owned a 1997 Grand AM.  Can you possibly imagine a person five foot two inches behind the wheel of a Grand AM pregnant with twins?

We already had older children as I have stated in my profile.  Stats:  Two adults, two tweenagers...Twins...NO ROOM.

We started searching for minivans that would be convenient for our use.  I was amazed at the different vans and packages available.

We finally settled for the Plymouth Voyager.  I say settled, because at the time I didn't realize how much I would grow to love this vehicle.

Recently, I had all the kids in the van and was in an automobile accident.  A &quot;gentleman&quot; ran into the back of us.  There wasn't a scratch left on our van, yet plenty of damage to the &quot;gentleman&quot; automobile.  

&quot;MY&quot; van has plenty of advantages..but the one I like the most is the drivers side sliding door.  I can easily put the twins in and get them out of the auto without having to crawl across the seat as my friends in previous years when this option wasn't available.  This van has made riding and traveling a pleasure since the day we got it.  Everyone has plenty of room.  This van also has enough room in the back to store the double stroller without problems.  

This van is a mother's dream, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with twins or more than two children.
