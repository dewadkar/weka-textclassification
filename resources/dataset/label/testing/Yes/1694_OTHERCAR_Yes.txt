            When I purchased my 1997 Honda CR-V in April 1997, it was a brand-new model in a high-demand low-supply environment. I had a significant amount of trouble getting the desired accessories delivered to the dealer to be installed on the vehicle because Honda America was overwhelmed with initial orders.

My Honda dealership offered many above-and-beyond CR-V accessories from approved aftermarket vendors which were covered under the Honda 3-year/36,000-mile warranty. My CR-V features: Flamenco Black Pearl paint, automatic transmission (only choice in '97), accessory 5-spoke wheels, ASC power sunroof, roof rack, remote locks/alarm, stereo speaker tweeters, exhaust pipe finisher, and floor mats. In addition, I had separately installed an Alpine AM/FM/CD stereo unit (replacing the Honda AM/FM unit), Hella high-power horn, and window tinting all-around.

The dealership also offered dealer-installed leather seating for $1495, but it did not appeal to me because it used zippers for fittment, instead of proper sewn stitching. The CR-V in the showroom had this option installed, and the net effect looked and felt like a loose glove around the seats. Not Honda quality at all.

In the CR-V vs RAV4 wars, the CR-V has proven itself as the class leader. For around $20,000, you can get a high-quality 4WD vehicle with a SUV-like command view of the road.

What you DON'T get is a lot of engine power. The CR-V's worst feature is its lack of power. A 4-cylinder 126-horsepower engine isn't going to move a 3150-pound vehicle very quickly, regardless of the brochure-touting Long Intake Runners. Its most noticable in driving up hills and inclines, and during highway passing. Even when the engine is strained in the upper revs, it just makes a lot of noise instead of producing the results you desire.

I also find the Grade Logic Control System a bit sluggish in transition. When I level-off from an incline, it tends to keep the gear in 3rd well after it should &quot;logically&quot; be in 4th.

I have never used the picnic table, and all the CR-V owners I have ever talked to have said they never used it either. Same goes for the wet storage well. Very gimmicky. A much more useful feature would have been a small built-in refrigerator.

The two-part rear door is another complaint of mine. For a door size this small (remember: this is no Chevy Suburban), the bottom half would function better as folding dowm, not swinging out. I am always having to be careful that the door doesn't swing into the vehicle next to mine. In addition, this door is not tail gate party friendly (a protruding obstacle !). An example of a more elegant solution is BMW's new 3-Series Touring (wagon) which keeps the two-part door, but it also can act as a single door hatch via its clever design.

The grey interior is a bit depressing. Honda should offer a tan color scheme to brighten-up the mood. Factory leather option would help, too. Heated seats. Factory glass sunroof. Larger wheels (Passport-size). And, of course, a V6 engine. These features would substantially improve the CR-V and ensure its class-leading role.

Still, compared with the RAV4 (too small interior), Suzuki Grand Vitara (Suzuki ownership reputation not at Consumer Reports level, and dealerships are rare in numbers), and Jeep Cherokee (antiquated truck chassis in this class), the CR-V would be your best bet for an under-$30,000 SUV.<br><br>
