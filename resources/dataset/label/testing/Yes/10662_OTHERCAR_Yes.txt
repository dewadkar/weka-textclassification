            After September 11th last year, it was stressed to everyone to do our patriotic duty and buy something.  I had just returned to work full time after two years of being a stay-at-home Mom.  My poor little 88 Tercel had died, and John and I were sharing one car.  Obviously, a family of four, with two full-time employees, needs more than one car.  Every day on my rounds, I would pass a car lot with many beautiful used vehicles tied up in red, white, and blue ribbons with signs proclaiming, &#147No Money Down!  Zero Interest For Six Months!  God Bless America!  Stick It To Osama And Buy A Car!&#148   You get the point.  I needed a car; the USA needed me to buy a car.  Perfect argument, right?  John didn&#146t think so.  We bickered back and forth about buying a second car (and a second car-payment) for several weeks.  
	Then, one day I saw it as I drove down the avenue.  It was big, it was green, it had a red balloon tied to the antenna, a luggage rack on the roof, and a little spoiler on the back in a feeble attempt to look sporty.  I sat at the light, looking at the mini-van, thinking to myself, &#147That is such a pretty thing.  The kids will love it!  It will be so handy on trips to Ohio to visit the Grandmas.&#148  
	John took a little more convincing.  I kept talking about how badly we needed a second car, how easy it would be to load up the mini-van and take it on trips, how the kids would have plenty of room for all their stuff, ect.  Finally, just so I would shut up, he decided to take me to the car lot and show me that we couldn&#146t afford it.  We could afford it, and we drove it away that evening.  
	My &#147big-green-mini-van&#148 (all one word) is a 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager.  It had 48,000 miles on it when we drove it off the lot last October, and now has 63,000.  It has taken us to the North Carolina Outer Banks, two trips to Virginia Beach, and three trips to visit the Grandmas, 500 miles away.  I have even hauled furniture in it, thanks to the removable back seat. To say my van is handy would be an understatement.
	My Voyager does not have all the extras available.  It has the smaller V-6 engine, a tape player instead of CD player, and no electronic anything on the dash except the mileage/trip meter.  It does have power door locks, dual sliding doors, tilt wheel, cruise control, and two &#147plug-ins&#148 for electronic devices; one up front for my cell, and one in the back seat for Allen&#146s Game Boy.  Another handy feature is the grocery bag hooks in the hatch on the back seat.  I can hang up plastic grocery bags by their handles and not have a mess when I get home.
	 What do I like about my Voyager?  It has plenty of room and storage space.  There is even a locking drawer under the front passenger seat that I can hide extra diapers, or my purse, or keep audiotapes in.  The van feels very &#147comfortable&#148, and was designed for people who, like me, practically live in their cars.  It handles very well for such a large vehicle, and I do not worry about driving it on winding roads.  It also has two built-in child seats.  Lexi loved sitting in her own seat when we first bought it.  She is currently going through the terrible twos, and despises anything that confines her.  Every morning, I have to drive her to day care listening to her scream &#147I tuck!  Momma help!  I tuck!&#148 (For those of you who do not understand 2-year old language, the translation is &#147I&#146m stuck.&#148)  This vehicle is full of little handy-dandy niceties that I have grown accustomed to.  
	Okay, so what do I not like about my Voyager?  I do have a few complaints.  One is that it is difficult for me (at 5&#1463&#148) to judge distance while in reverse or parking.  Oh, I get by, I&#146m not a road hazard, but sometimes it is hard.  Also, the van is a gas hog.  It takes $22 to fill the tank (at $1.37 a gallon), and a full tank will not last a week in normal city driving conditions.  It does do much better on the interstate, or anywhere I can use the cruise control.  Also, I don&#146t like the way the transmission feels:  it shifts hard, almost like a standard transmission, especially when the engine is cold.  It can also be hard to start fro time-to-time.  It seems to need a tune up, even after a tune up.  I have also been told that a Chrysler engine does not feel/perform the same as a GM engine (what I am used to driving), and that for a Chrysler, it is mechanically sound.  Maybe I need a new mechanic.
	All in all, I have been pleased with my Plymouth, and would buy a new one if the opportunity arose.  I have embraced the &#147Mini-Van-Momma&#148 phase with gusto, though I still look at a Trans-Am or Mustang longingly when I stop at red lights.  Then, Lexi screams, or Allen says, &#147Mom, the light&#146s green,&#148 and I remember why I bought my Voyager, and I am content. If you are driving through Roanoke Rapids and pass a "big-green-mini-van" with an American Flag cling and a Jimmy Spencer sticker in the back window, honk at me.
