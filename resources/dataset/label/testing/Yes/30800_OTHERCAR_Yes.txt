            This camera is amazing for the price!  Beats many $600.00+ cameras on picture quality, both indoors and outdoors. You get 1.3 megapix resolution which alone is only available on cameras that cost many times more. The only drawback is the lack of optical zoom (the digital zoom is basically worthless). But if you can live without the zoom, this camera makes quick snapshots to the computer super fast and easy. Being this is my first digital camera, being able to view and delete pictures from the camera is a really cool feature.  It is very generous on batteries, but I would recommend buying an A/C adapter to use loading your photos to the computer.<br><br>
