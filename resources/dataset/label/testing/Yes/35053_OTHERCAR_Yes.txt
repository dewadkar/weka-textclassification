            Hearing a lot negative comments about English cars (Jaguars and Land Rovers) stopped me from ever thinking of English cars till I decided to test drive the lovely Discovery II.

Just by Sitting inside, I changed my idea completely.  It's so wonderfully comfortable. Leather interior , very high up, lumbar control, dual climate control, excellent sound system, panoramic view from all seats in the vehicle, even rear seats are so comfortable.

I enjoyed the smooth, quiet ride. It felt like driving on air.  The truck is solid and very well put together, I have driven many other trucks but no other truck like it.  I traded in my 97 Pathfinder and got the new Discovery II.......no comparison.

Now after 3 month of owning this beautiful truck I have no complaints other than it is a big gas guzzler much worse than my previous Pathfinder.
other minor problems is that the display light is not enough at night and power windows button is located on the console which is inconvinient.
Overall, the truck is solid, comfortable and fun to drive.  I give it two thumbs up.
