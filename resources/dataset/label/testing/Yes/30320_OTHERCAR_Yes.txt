            We bought this 1992 van in 1999 after our first son was born. The Chevy Beretta was nice, but we needed more room.

We paid around $8000 CDN for it and at the time it wasn't too bad. The thing is, when you buy used, you're buying someonelse's choices. They may not have wanted all the bells and whistles. Although, it isn't always "you get what you pay for". We've loved this van from the get go. And now that it's totally paid for, it's wonderful.

We had the built-in child seats in the center bench which is what sold my wife on it. I liked it because the seats were really comfortable (I sat in all of them for some time) which is a big plus because we travel quite a lot and I have back problems.

The options were the standard fare. AC, AM/FM Cassette, power mirrors and locks, power hatch release, tilt steering, cruise control, sliding door child lock and tinted windows. 3.3 litre v6 with a 3 speed overdrive transmission.

The body is holding up well, all things considered. We lived in the land of winter salt (Ontario, Canada) and the effects were starting to show in front of the rear wheels. Since moving to Alberta, the corrosion aspect has slowed considerably.

I've heard the transmission had a recall on it, but the previous owner had it taken care of before he traded it in. If you're considering purchasing one of these, inquire about it. ALL the Voyagers regardless of year seem to sound the same. A soft quick racheting sound from the underside when coming to a stop, those are the gears and synchros in the transmission and it's quite normal. Brand new ones today make the same sound.

We bought it with just over 100,000 km on it and now it's nearing 200,000. Regular oil changes and other preventative maintenance issues probably insure its longevity. We've travelled across Canada with it 3 times and the only flaw was when a fusible link burned out and the AC stopped working. That was a 10 cent fix.

Other items to be fixed were normal maintenance items. The water pump died a year after buying it. That was relatively cheap (around $40 CDN) and quick to fix (I do my own work). Brakes. The radiator is original and could probably be put off for a few more years, now that we're out of the salt environment.

It handles like a minivan of the era. A little top heavy, but not as bad as an Aerostar. Corners well for a minivan. Newer Voyagers handle a wee bit better as they aren't as tall.

Changing the seats in the rear is relatively simple. It can be done by one strong person. The bench seats can be cumbersome and awkward. The larger rear bench seat, once the smaller center one is removed, will move forward to where the small one was, as the floor has multiple anchor points. This was nice for long trips as the longer bench seat adjusts forward and back on tracks, and it also flips forward (closes like a book). The smaller built-in-child-seat bench does not, for safety reasons I imagine.

Fuel consumption is decent for a van of its size. I cannot give details as ours is in dire need of a tune up due to my proficiency in procrastination, but it used to get around 650-700 km on the highway.

The front wheel drive does well enough for itself in all Canadian weather. I don't ever recall getting stuck in anything. (I might add that I did use it to get a Jeep Cherokee 4x4 out of the snow though).

Overall we are very satisfied with our purchase.
