            I think the critics have gone &quot;soft&quot; my friends. If they are looking for something more feminine, check out the Asian models or mini vans.

I am now driving a 2001 Z28, my fourth F-body since 78 and I don't know what the critics are talking about. The 2001 is the best F-body to date; better breaks, more power, and superior handling. The only people I am aware of with reliability problems are those who spend Sundays at the local drag strip and weekdays racing red light to red light.

If you make comparisons of reliability Asian imports with no power then of course nothing will break.

A rubber band powered balsa wood model plane is much more reliable than an F16.
