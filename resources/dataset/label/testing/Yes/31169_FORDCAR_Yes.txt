             I bought a 1998 Ford Mustang. I love it. It gives me attitude! And I truely believe it has made me look better not to mention, feel lots better. The car has power. It doesn't like to sit at stop signs or stop lights. As it sits there it is ready to take off! It's like a lawnmower in drive, it just goes all on it's own. You must be extremely careful in school zones or areas with a low speed limit. I am constantly braking in these areas because the car likes SPEED. Be prepared for speeding tickets. This car drives soooo smooth that you hardly notice you're doing 80,90,100.... This is defintely not a practical car so only people who aren't practical should consider buying a Ford Mustang. It is a car for someone who likes to spoil themselves. Definetely a must for people who want attention. I've not had any problems with my car but yet it's still fairly new. I don't foresee any problems as it has been a very reliable car. If it's speed, attitude, &amp; a smooth ride you're after, this car's for you!!!<br><br>
