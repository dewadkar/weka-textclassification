            Last week, my family and I were called out-of-state for my grandfather's funeral.  Since we were flying into a city that is actually about 35 miles from our destination, we needed to rent a car.  The car that we wound up renting for the week was a <b>2001 Honda Accord Sedan EX</b>.  Wow, what a nice car!

*<i> When reviewing a car, there is no way to cover all the bases (engine, comfort, interior features, exterior features, and so on.).  The review would be approximately 280 pages long.  So I am going to review it from the perspective of a passenger in the car. </i>*

My father has a <i>2000 Honda Accord Coupe </i>, so I expected the two cars to be very similar.  In fact, they are quite different.  Apart from the obvious difference that one is a sedan and one a coupe, there are other differences as well.  From  the inside, most things LOOK about the same, but they aren't when you look closer.


<b>Interior Features</b>

o <i>LATCH system.</i>  For those of you who have read my other reviews, you had to know I would discuss something that has to do with kids.  The LATCH system, of course, does.  LATCH stands for "Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children."  When installing a child carseat, installation is usually easier and more secure when you use tethers.  Tethers are much like a seat belt that is attached at one end to the carseat and at the other end to tether anchors installed in the package shelf of the back seat.  New in 2000 and 2001 cars, however, are the LOWER anchors.  The <b>2001 Honda Accord Sedan EX</b> also has these lower anchors to secure a car seat.  The lower anchors are hidden in the fold of the seat.  There are four upside-down "U" shaped metal anchors in the seat.  To anchor a carseat to these, you have to have a carseat that is LATCH-compatable.  Like the upper tethers, the lower tethers also look like a seat belt and they hook to these U-shaped anchors in the seat crease.  The way the four anchors are set up, you could actually have two kids using them- one on either side OR you could have one child in the middle of the back seat using them.

o <i>Fold-Down Drink Holder</i>.  In the back seat, where you would standardly find a fold-down arm rest, you find a fold-down arm rest with drink holders built in.  The two drink holders are two different sizes.  The one holder is the perfect size for a can, they other better sized for a large cup.

o <i>Easy Access to the Trunk</i>.  When the fold-down arm rest is down, you have easy access to the trunk.  There is a black plastic divider between the arm rest and the trunk that can be lowered by squeezing a lever and lowering the plastic divider.  Having this access really came in handy when we were driving and i just HAD to have my magazine out of the trunk.

o <i>Driver's Seat</i>.  Oooh La La!!!  The driver's seat in the <b>2001 Honda Accord Sedan</b> is really nice.  Not only does it have power height adjustment, but it also has lumbar support.  This is not new to Hondas, but this model's lumbar support seems nicer than previous models'.  To adjust the lumbar support, you push a lever on the side of the seat (to the right) until you find the location you like.

o <i>Power Everything.</i> Like most cars now-a-days, the <b>2001 Honda Accord Sedan</b> has power locks and windows.  This in not a big deal, but it is nice.

o <i>Single CD player.</i> As an EX (Honda's top of the line), the car comes with a single built-in CD player that has spectacular performance.  I am sure you can upgrade to a 6-CD changer if you wanted to do so.

<b>Exterior Features</b>

o <i>Moonroof</i>.  The EX comes standard with a moonroof, which is controlled by controls to the left of the driver.  Having the moonroof was nice when we were driving at night.  During the day, it was far too hot to use it, so we didn't.

o<i> Remote Entry</i>.  Again, this is not a feature unique to this car, but it is a nice feature.  This allows you to unlock or lock the car from a remote location by pushing a button on the remote control that is on your key-chain.

o <i>Auto-Off Lights</i>.  If you leave your headlights on, after a short while (about 5 minutes, I think), the car automatically turns them off.  What a lifesaver on the battery!!!!

<b>Safety Features</b>

o <i>LATCH/Tethers</i>.  I discussed this above.

o <i> Dual Airbags</i>  There is both a driver and passenger side airbag for the front passengers.

o <i> Shoulder Belts all around</i>.  All seating locations, including the rear middle position, have lap/shoulder belt combinations to optimal safety.


I was VERY happy in the <b>2001 Honda Accord Sedan.</b> I found it to be a well-made, quiet car that offered a lot of what I find important in a car.  It also is attractive, but I guess that really doesn't matter.

The model we drove for the week retails for about $23,000.  We, of course, as renters, did not pay that for the car.
