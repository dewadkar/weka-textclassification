            I had been looking at the CRV from the time I first heard of it being planned, because I had owned successively, purchased new, a 1985 Civic 2wd Station Wagon, purchased used, a 1985 Civic 4wd Station Wagon, purchased new, a 1988 4wd Civic Station Wagon, and, finally, purchased used another 1988 4wd Civic Station Wagon.  When I learned that there was to be no successor to the 1991 Civic Station Wagon, I felt that an era of sensible automobiles had passed.

Before I purchased my last Civic Station wagon, I tried a succession of other, similar, cars, only to be disappointed.  I tried the 1990 Nissan Axxess, the Mitsubishi  EXP, the Kia Sportage, Mercury Mountaineer, and Ford Explorer.  None of these combined the unique qualities of my Civic Station Wagon.

When I first saw and test drove the CRV, I knew it was for me, but I could not bring myself to buy one at that time.  I, later, shopped one on the net and got a quote on a 1998 CRV with manual transmission for $18k, but even that was too much.  I also shopped for a used one and, in middle 1998, I found a red 1997, my favorite color, at a local dealer for $18k.  Sometime later, in Feb 1999, I changed jobs and needed to quickly replace my 1988, so I contacted the dealer and asked if they still had it.  They did, so I went over and, after much haggling, negotiated a final price of $15k, before trade.  The car was immaculate and had only 20000 miles on it, so I was very pleased to purchase it.

My CRV now has close to 50000 miles on it and the only replacement I could, now, consider would be for a newer CRV, although I keep looking.  I recently test drove a 2001 Ford Excape, that seemed to be Fordï¿½s best try at copying the CRV, but, although I carefully measured most dimensions and found them to be very similar, I found that the Ford was harder for me to get into and rode much more roughly.

I also found that, according to the Kelley Blue Book, the trade-in value of my car is still within a $1000 of what I paid for it almost two years and 30000 miles ago.  Honda is doing something very right!
