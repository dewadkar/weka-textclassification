            I work for an engineering consulting corporation that has FINALLY gone digital.  They may have been slow about it but they made the RIGHT CHOICE...

The Sony Mavica - Digital Camera

This is by far the most USER FRIENDLY digital camera on the market.  Our company owns at least three different Mavica models (some are better than others.  What makes this camera user friendly?  Let me list it out for you:

1) EASY TO USE / STANDARD FORMAT:

All photos are recorded onto a standard 3.5&quot; floppy disk.  No memory sticks or funky cords are required.  This unit is actually a camera, floppy disk drive, and mini-monitor rolled into one piece of equipment.  Just slap a disk in, take some pictures, eject the disk, throw it into your computer's disk drive, and open the pictures in almost any photo/graphic workshop program (Paintbrush, PhotoShop, Corel Draw, etc.).   All of the photos are recorded in JPEG format (.jpg).  This is a graphic standard used everywhere - especially on the internet.  E-mailing photos is a piece of cake!

2) CAMERA FEATURES

I would not be able to list all of the great &quot;camera&quot; features of this unit, so I will hit the highlights.

ZOOM - Most of the Mavica's have a 10xpower optical zoom!  This is fantastic for a zoom camera.  I took candid wedding photos of my friend without him knowing (since I was about 80 feet away).  The pictures turned out great!
RESOLUTION - Make sure to get the Mavica with the higher resolution (640x480 is NOT enough)!  We use them for business and 640x480 is acceptable, but personal photos need a significantly higher resolution (minimum 800x600).  When you edit and print your pictures, you will thank your lucky stars that you bought the higher resolution camera.
CAMERA SCREEN - The mini-monitor on the back of the camera is great!  You use it to aim and shoot pictures, AND to review past pictures and delete them if you want!  This feature is a lot of fun!

3) DURABLE

The cameras at my company are well over a year old and they have worked flawlessly since purchase!  They have been everywhere (construction sites, new property developments, factories, etc.) and put up with higher than average abuse.  Sony has once again lived up to its reputation of quality.


RECOMMENDATIONS:  If you intend to get a digital camera, seriously consider and try out the Sony Mavica series --- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!  Make sure to get higher resolution camera and look for some of the models that can also record short VIDEO clips (yes! some of the &quot;still&quot; camera can shoot short video clips!).

STATS:

1 3.5&quot; Floppy disk can hold about:

20 pictures (640x480)
12 pictures (800x600)
7 pictures (1024x786)

The 10x optical zoom is equivalent to a f40 to 400mm zoom lens in a 35mm camera.

Compatible with:  Windows� 3.1 / Windows� 95/98/2000 / Windows NT� 4.0 or Mac� OS System 7.5.<br><br>
