            First a few disclaimers.  I have to grant the Alero its dues before I flame it.

First off, I only had it for a week.  Secondly, it was a rental that already had almost 30,000 miles on it.  Thirdly, this was the lowest of all the trim levels of the Alero.  All of this puts my "test model" at a bit of a disadvantage.

I was actually looking forward to driving the Alero.  It was somewhat of a disappointment.  The Alero reaffirms my beliefs that GM makes cheap cars with poor fit and finish.

The interior looked cheap, the parts were cheap.  None of the controls click into place or snap to attention.  Instead, all buttons, levers, switches sort of jiggle about or slide a little bit out of alignment.  The interior felt cheaper than my old car, a Dodge Neon, which is supposed to be an econocar.

My model had a big hole in the driver's seat.  Some of the rubber lining around the keyhole was coming out.  There was a noticeable paint flake on the rear of the car.  Sometimes, the engine sounded weird, like it was dying or something was breaking inside of it.

I know this is a rental model, but still, it's also a 2000 model.  Is this what an Alero owner can expect several years down the road?

Having said that, I still believe that the Alero is a fine effort by GM at a compact/midsized vehicle.  Handling is not great,  but it's certainly adequate.

One of the car's strong point is its engine.  The 150 hp had plenty of kick.  Put the pedal to the metal, and you are greeted with smooth, strong acceleration (better, I think, than the V6 mustang I am driving right now).  I can only assume that the V6 Alero delivers even more impressive performance.

The car's other strong point is its styling.  Personally, I think GM is clueless when it comes to making attractive cars.  The Alero is one of their most handsome cars.  In fact, I would daresay that most of the Oldsmobile lineup looks pretty good.  So why in the world is GM killing their only good looking cars??

All in all, I would not buy an Alero myself, but given the current market, you could probably get loaded one for under 20k, which makes it a pretty good buy.
