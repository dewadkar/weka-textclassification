            I grew up in the 70's and 80's when Hyundai was synonymous for boring box on wheels.  When my wife and I started looking at cars recently, we knew we wanted something sporty, but no something that would cost us every other paycheck.  When my wife suggested looking at Hyundai, chills went up my spine.  The horror stories of cars that simply did not function, with completely short circuited electrical systems flashed through my mind.

She got me to go anyway.  All I can say is WOW,  Hyundai has changed. 

When I first say the 2000 Tiburon, it was hard to believe that this car was made by the same company that was so plagued by problems with boxy design a decade ago.  Sleek, stylish, bold design, and crazy colors.  The Tiburon's beautiful bold design is clearly its strength.

The inside design meets the expectations set out by the outward appearance.  The front seats are roomy and comfortable.  Plenty of leg room.  The back and lumbar support is firm and comfortable.  One of the few disadvantages is that the back seats are very cramped.  Not at all appropriate for two adults, but suitable for children or in our case a chubby cocker spaniel.

The list of standard features is impressive, and the options are not terribly expensive.  The car can be nicely equipped for about 10-15% over the base price.

The only major drawback is that their is only one engine option.  It is a four cylinder and lacks the power of a true sports car.  The car is certainly peppy enough and certainly compares well to the most powerful of compact cars, but it is probably well toward the low end of the sport cars with which it tries to compete.  I wish that Hyundai had offered an option to upgrade to the six cylinder engine that it puts in its Elantra.

Finally, you can not beat the best warranty in the industry.  I believe that the base warranty is 6 year 60k bumper to bumper AND 10 year 100k power train.  For about 5% of the base price we chose to extend the bumper to bumper warranty to 10y 100k.  By the way, we had some minor problems with carpet and air conditioning and the dealership stood behind the warranty without hesitation.

In summary, this is a great little car.  Gorgeous design and some of the brightest colors on the market.  It gets second looks wherever we go.  We got the automatic, and it lacks a little in the power category, but is certainly peppy enough to comfortably enter a busy highway in rush hour traffic without making the car behind you hit the breaks.  Perhaps the manual transmission model would offer somewhat better performance.

If you want a really fast sports car, this is probably not the model for you.  If you want a well designed comfortable sporty compact car which will not drain your wallet, but will look good with you in the driver seat, check this one out.<br><br>
