            I live in the heart of Chicago now, so I no longer own a car, but when I did it was a Saturn.  My Saturn was actually my third car, and I will never buy anything else.  First, I bought it used from the dealer, and it was in perfect shape!! The few times that I did have problems with it (usually my own fault), the service I received from Saturn was wonderful.  Whether I had service trouble, or just needed some advice, the people at Saturn were always there for me.  They made it personal, by keeping the relationship on a first name basis, and never charging me for the little extras!  In fact, I once locked my keys in the car 45 minutes from the nearest dealership.  It was almost 6pm (closing time for my Saturn dealership) and they cut me a new key and had someone drive it to me for no charge.  The guy was even happy about it!!!  I have never known a car company to take such a personal interest in their customers, and it truly makes a difference!!! I will never own anything but a Saturn!!!<br><br>
