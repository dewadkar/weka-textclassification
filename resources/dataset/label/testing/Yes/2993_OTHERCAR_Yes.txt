            Before i go and praise this vehicle i'd like to say its not without its fair share of problems mainly off highway.  It is however, one of the most entertaining vehicles to drive.

First off you have to understand what the vehicle was designed for.  Yes i say that in every review i write..  but isn't it the truth?  I mean you can't just hop in an SUV and expect it to perform like a car on the road..  Cheers

We've owned this vehicle for a year now and counting.  No problems mechanically except for the minor things we've done to it off road, heh.  I will say it won't keep up with our convoy of Land Rover's off road, but on the flipside our Land Rover's won't keep up with the Jeep on the road.

Jeep designed the wrangler as a very exciting and fun go just about anywhere vehicle.  the wrangler will work wonders on the road and certainly is a blast to drive as it will zip in and out of parking lots and traffic as well as take most off road trails with ease.

I have no complaints on this vehicle.  it stands mechanically sound, no problems from elctrics, rides fairly smooth for a Cute-Ute.  It is not the type of vehicle you would want to take on long trips.  It does get very uncomfortable due to the short wheel base, tight shocks, and cab setup.  For the short hauls and off road treks this vehicle is perfect and fun.

Understanding what this vehicle is and was designed for is key to enjoying it.  Many chaps i know have been disillusioned with its off road prowess.  It is a bit overrated for 4wheeling.  Jeep shows it going everywhere with ease any all that nonsense.  a stock jeep simply put will not keep up with a stock Land Rover.  Suspension, weight, torque, horsepower, and all the goodies of what makes a TRUE SUV go places are problems here.  there you have it.

This vehicle is perfect for the average American who doesn't plan to travel far or take the vehicle in the amizon or across africa.  It will bring a smile to your face let me tell you.. when driving it.  One of the most fun vehicles on the market.  Top Cute-Ute out there.
