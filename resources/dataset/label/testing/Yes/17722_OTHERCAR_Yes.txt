                 So you are thinking about buy ing a saturn.
      di you ever think an SL was right for you well it is if you are looking for that perfact little famly car a four door SL1 comes copete with all the good stuff power windows doors adomatic steat belts in the front and an esly reachable trunk.       I know what your thinking  a saturn SL1 only has 80hp thats cary diving around in a little balled car like that!!!!
well then the SL2 is what you are going for with 124hp and it only weighs 2400bls&quot;this is the car i own&quot; it come in manual and altomatic&quot;i have the alto because it is not that much differents in speed because saturn has a niffety little button in all of its alto's a performince button witch when on makes the car shift just like and even better than an manual. and when twieked alittle bit you can get these cars up to 230hp giving it a 0-60mph of 5.9sec email me at bigjimmytimmy@canada.com to find out more or how to boost your saturn up!!!!!!!!<br><br>
