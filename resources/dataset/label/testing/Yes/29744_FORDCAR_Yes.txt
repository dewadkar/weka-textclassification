            Although The explorer's design is showing age from it's extensive re modeling in 94', the Explorer continues to be a reliable and dependable truck for the long haul, fun, or the short commute. It also continues to be the best selling SUV in america. Overall fit and finish and quality all round is well done. Only minor glitches like a broken sensor or a bad winsheild wiper. All repairs were fixed free of charge. On my explorer we purchased the Eddie Bauer package which included signature leather seats and additional brand name extras. The upgrade though expensive to me was well worth it. Along with our explorer we purcahsed the premium JBL Stereo system with the powered sub-woofer in the rear. The quality of the system is far more than one would expect out of a usual factory installed sytem. To tow our boat's we purchased the towing package which was expensive for what it was, we found it to be cheaper to go to U-Haul and install it cheaper. For harsh winters we also purchased the 4x4 package which boosted the price yet another grand, honestly we have never used the 4x4 because we found the traction on the explorer to be adequete enough for the harsh winters we experience in illinois. If you are planning on doing some heavy off-roading which very few people do in their $30,000 suv then buy it otherwise it is just an extra that baloons the price alot. Engine choices were between an SOHC V-6 or a regular V-8. after doing my research I found the SOHC only lacked 10 horsepower from the V-8 and was alot cheaper. If you are thinking about buying an explorer in the near future I would suggest the Eddie Bauer Package if you can afford it. Go for the SOHC V-6 unless you are deadset on the V-8. Completely avoid the 4x4 unless you really plan on using it. And always shop around we bought our explorer about $4,000 less than the sticker price because of all sort's of year end deals and rebates from the factories on certain model's. The Explorer is a dependable, safe, and fun to drive car.<br><br>
