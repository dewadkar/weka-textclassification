            We looked at the gamut of minivans before buying our 1999 Nissan Quest GXE about a year ago. For what we were able to spend, the only other vehicle we seriously considered was the Plymouth Voyager but were put off by concerns about their reliability (especially transmissions). The Quest GXE had the main things we wanted and were willing to pay for: good reputation, good resale value, cruise, A/C, stereo cassette, power windows and locks, ABS (front only), 2 rear side doors, and... a color we liked. The TV/VCR deal was nice icing on the cake.
After about a year:
- No major problems. One door needed to be aligned slightly, one piece of weatherstripping needed to be replaced, and eventually I will need to get the &quot;combination switch&quot; for the wiper/turn signal replaced. (This last issue seems to be a not unusual problem from the Quest message board at Edmunds.com. The wiper just seems to go off every once in a while.)
- Performance has been satisfactory. I'm used to small, underpowered, manual transmission cars, so this seems like a big vehicle to me, but it is still rather sprightly.
- The TV/VCR has worked out fine. It has been easiest just to leave it in the vehicle, so I do miss the room between the front seats. The TV reception is pitiful, but it doesn't matter with our rule: it stays off unless the trip is longer than an hour.
- The rear shelf is a handy feature.
- Disappointments: I usually have been able to beat the posted MPG guides on my vehicles. For the Quest it is 17/24. The best I've ever done was 23.5 and the worst has been about 15 with winter, in-town driving. (As in Fargo, ND) If super unleaded is less than 2 cents/gal more than regular, I get it, because it does make a difference.
- Interior lighting is not well designed. There are only two overhead dome lights, so it is a bit of a problem for someone to read at night. (I believe that different lighting configurations come in other Quest models.)
- The sliding track seating is functional, but you do not take out the center bench seat just for the fun of it. It works, but it is an effort. The rear seat doesn't come out at all. There are three slightly different positions it can be set toward the back or else it folds and comes all the way forward. It would be nice if it could come out for hauling large items. We did like it in the 'limosine' configuration when we went on vacation with the kids.
- The ads brag about 20 or 30 cupholders in the vehicle!!!! Only four at most are worth anything. It is a problem for the kids in the back seat where the cup holders are in an awkward position behind them.

That's the main things. As we say around here, it's not bad, it's not great,... it's fine.<br><br>
