            The 2000 Impala has a luxury feel with an average sticker price. Yes the Impala is a midsize car, but when you sit behind the steering wheel you soon realize it has a fullsize car interior. It can come with 60/40 front seat easily seating six comfortably. Lots of head and leg room for those who are tall, even if seating in the back seat. The seats are comfortable for those long rides.The Impala is equipped with daytime running lights and for those who are forgetful it automatically shuts off about 30 seconds after locking the doors. The 16&quot; tires makes for a smooth ride with little tire/roads noise. Theftlock is a plus.

The dashboard design looks outdated for a 2000 car and doesn't seem to appeal to the X generation. As baby boomers we agree, but were more forgiving once we took the car for a spin. Inside the armrest is the dual cupholders that is not only awkward to pull out but your drinks can easily spill on the seats. There is a change holder also inside of the armrest, but it is a challenge to get the change out because once again is in an awkward position. Infact, I needed the front seat passenger to help get the change out. Because of the luxury feel I was very disappointed it didn't come in diamond white.           <br><br>
