            I love my chevy venture!  It is spacious enough for all of my 6 children.
plenty of leg room for my 6'4 son and his football friends.  We have taken many vacations, long distance without a problem of breaking down, too crowed, plenty of air flow + heat when needed.  One of the features the chevy venture has is the reclined seats for resting on long trips.  plenty of space for luggage, or groceries.  which we have a lot of with 6 children.  The color is taupe, and it never looks diry! It is very stylish for a mom driving around town.  Someday I'll be ready for a car, but for now Iam so glad for a Great looking van like the chevy venture.<br><br>
