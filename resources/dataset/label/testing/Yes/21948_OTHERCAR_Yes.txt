            I bought my 1991 Jeep Cherokee Sport in 1993 with 50,000 miles.  Being young and active I thought it would be a good vehicle to take up skiing or on camping trips.  Seven years later I could not be happier.  This car spent 6 years (since I have owned it) in the northeast fighting every winter.  This past year I have been kinder and brought it to the �Bay Area� for its final years.

I had been looking for a new SUV for the past year and have stopped until my Jeep decides to call it quits.  For anyone interested in this vehicle, I would focus on a couple of items. I have a standard 5-speed transmission with a straight 6 engine.  This has been very reliable and it still purrs like a kitten.   In fact, I still am using the original clutch.  I have friends with the V6 engines who have not had as much luck.  Things that have saved me money and the life of the car are: oil changes every 3k, new tires every 50k, tune up every 80k and using 4WD every 3 � 5 months.  I have found that putting the car in 4WD for 20 miles or so, this keeps all of the components lubed and ready when you actually need it.  I recommend rainy days; turning in 4WD on dry roads will hurt the car.

Some of the major problems with the car are the superficial items.  After 120,000 miles my back wiper went and I could not find a motor to replace it.  Being from the Northeast I have had some rust to contend with, mostly around the door handles and the windshield. This hasn�t been a major problem but sometime the windshield may leak on stormy days.
One of the most annoying things about my Jeep is the airfoil of the car.  The way it is designed, any rocks or pebbles that bounce in front of the car head right for the lower center of the windshield.  This has caused me to replace the windshield 5 times since I have owned the car and I currently have a chip just waiting to grow.  Other than wear items, breaks, tires, muffler etc.  I have only had one major repair.  I had to spend $900 to have the transmission rebuilt at 185,000 miles.

Overall I have been please with this car and will most likely look at another Jeep to replace my old one.   But, at this rate I may have to wait another couple of years.
