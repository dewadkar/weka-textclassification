            This camera is one of the best cameras on the market for several reasons.  First, the size is obviously a benefit.  If you spend $500 on something, you need to use it.  With a nearly pocket-sized camera such as this, you seem to be more inclined to take it with you, thus increasing its value.

Secondly, this camera takes suprisingly good photos, especially for being a pocket-sized, digital camera.  The colors are great (although sometimes a bit too bright).  The sharpness is also good, although the Olympus 490-Zoom probably gets the mark for sharpness.  The zoom is also very adequate and very important to have in a camera.  Although only 2X, it definitely improves the picture.   

One other truly nice feature of this camera is the photo display on the back of the camera.  When I went to the store to test several cameras, the S-100 had by far the clearest photo replay of any model I have looked at.  Clearly this is an important feature as one major advantage of a digital camera is the ability to see the shot immediately.  If the replay is not clear, this feature become less useful.

The battery life is a little questionable, but the 2-hour charge makes charging the battery very convenient.  When I first got the camera, the battery life was pathetic (less than 30 minutes).  After charging and discharging several times, the battery life improved dramatically.
