            I bought a used 1994 Saturn SL in 1994. I highly recommend it for several reasons, mainly it was affordable and had the luxury features I wanted.
PROS:
1) Very nice sales people who are not hard sell
2) Only things I've ever had to do was buy new tires and a battery
3) Affordable, but with luxury features such as power windows, power door locks and cruise control
4) Can park it anywhere, it is small enough
5) Pretty good on gas mileage

CONS:
1) Slow on acceleration, but I knew that when I bought it
2) When raining or using windshield washer, water gets into car
3) Seats are small

If you want a smaller, affordable car with luxury features, Saturn SL is a good choice.<br><br>
