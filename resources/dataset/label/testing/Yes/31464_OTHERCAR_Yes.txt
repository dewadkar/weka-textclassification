            When I got this camera I was looking for a sub $200 model. I couldn't find many reviews back in December when I got the camera but HP's other models seemed to score decently. 
   On the plus side the camera is very easy to learn, out of the box one can easily discover most or all of the features with out touching the manual. Its point and shoot so there are no lens settings to worry about. You will have to decide if you want the flash on, off, or auto. Also there is a "red eye reduction mode" I suggest leaving that on, as allot of the pictures I have taken seem to have creepy glowing red eyes. Also there is a button for the quality of the picture you want to take 1 being the lowest and of thumbnail size and 3 being the largest and most detailed. I recommend leaving the camera on the second setting if you do not have a compact flash card (additional memory card that slides into the side of the camera) at that setting with the internal ram it will take about 6 pictures. (If you purchase a 64MB flash card that number will jump to around 130 images) 
   Now for the negative side of things; the camera features a excessively slow shutter speed, so don�t plan on taking back to back photos (like at a sporting event, concert etc...) It will only shoot 1 picture about every 30 seconds. The camera also has a very bad appetite for expensive lithium AA batteries (they run around $5 for 2 AA) I would say I average around 2-4 hours of actual use from a set of batteries. On a more serious note the camera doesn�t come with a storage bag or a cover for the lens, the least they could have done was thrown in a plastic lens cover, once the lens scratches you might as well toss the camera. Another problem I have come across since I have large hands, the lens is in a very awkward location, it is located on the left hand side of the camera, right were you would normally hold a typical camera. I have several nice pitchers of my fingers. Another particularly annoying thing is the built in LCD screen on the back, it is virtually useless outside, even in shade you can not make out what is being displayed on the screen, so you have to point, shoot and hope everything comes out all right.
  Overall with the negative features listed above it is a very capable camera for the novice. It takes really good pictures, and if you have a good printer and photo paper the images look better than shots taken in to a developer.
