            <b>Good Features</b>
This camera has many fine features and several outstanding features.
This tempts you to expect that the rest of the features would be
designed to the same high standard, but the user interface and the USB
interface are not. This camera can take great pictures. I don't know
of anything better -- but I am still disappointed and wistful, because
with a few modest changes this camera could have been made much
friendlier. Much, much friendlier.

My favorite features include:
 --  It excels at close-up "macro" shots. Competing brands don't
come anywhere close.
 --  It is small enough to take along almost anywhere.
 --  Although some people mock its swiveling mechanical
design, likening it to a "transformer" toy, it actually makes sense.
It can have a long optical path in a small package, without the
complexity of multi-stage telescoping. This is probably not unrelated
to the excellent macro performance.
 --  The optics are good and sharp.
 --  The LCD viewfinder is well-behaved. This is in marked contrast
to the more-or-less comparable Canon model, where the LCD isn't bright
enough and suffers strange color-shifts depending on viewing angle.
<p>
The camera has the four basic exposure modes (Programmed-auto,
Aperture-priority, Shutter-priority, and Manual ... P, A, S, and M,
respectively). It also has about 16 fancy "scene" modes, such as
Close-up, Night-portrait, Party/Indoor, et cetera). Most of these
appear to be variations on Programmed-auto mode, with various tweaks
and biases applied to the program, but they are so poorly documented
that one can't be sure.

See reference 1 for a fuller discussion of facts and figures
on the many, many features of this camera.

<b>Broken Features and Missing Features</b>

 --  The lens isn't the fastest thing you'll ever see.
 --  The user interface is poorly designed; see discussion below.
 --  The USB interface is for file-transfer only. No camera control,
not even shutter release via USB; see discussion below.
 --  The EXIF header in the .jpg file doesn't contain 
focus-distance information. Other brands manage to include this.
 --  The User Guide is superficial. I would have liked to see a lot more
technical information about what the various features do.

<b>User Interface Deficiencies</b>

 --  In general, there is an overall lack of orthogonality. Features
that ought to be independent have illogical interactions.
 --  As a conspicuous example of non-orthogonality, the manual-focus
feature is only available in the four basic exposure modes (P, S, A,
and M), not in any of the "scene" modes.
 --  There is no quantitative information about the focus-distance
when using manual focus. There is only a low-precision qualitative
indication, i.e. a thermometer-style bar that goes from "flowers"
(near focus) to "mountains" (far focus). It is impossible to choose a
desired focus-distance <i>a priori</i> and dial it in. It is not even
easy to reproduce a previously-used focus-distance setting. This is
in contrast to other brands, which manage to display a numerical value
for the focus-distance. Even some scale of tick-marks against which
the thermometer bar could be compared would be a step in the right
direction. Tick-marks plus digits would be ideal.
 --  The "focus confirmation" feature is useful only on rare
occasions. It applies a faint "highlighting" effect to the in-focus
region, but the effect is usually not sufficiently noticeable, even if
you know exactly what to look for.
 --  It takes two hands to dial in a manual-focus setting. This is
in contrast with, say, the exposure-bias setting, which can be dialled
using only one hand, even while holding the camera in the same hand.
 --  The battery status indicator does not appear at all unless the
battery is low. That means you can't just grab the camera and run;
you don't know whether the battery is almost full or almost low.

If I had been designing this thing, I would have put a few more
function buttons on top, where there's plenty of room, so that there
would be 100% orthogonal one-handed control of
 --  Shutter exposure time (in S and M modes).
 --  Aperture (in A and M modes).
 --  Exposure bias (in P, S, and A modes).
 --  Focus distance (in all exposure modes).
 --  Zoom.
 --  Shifting of the "spot" when spot-focus and/or spot-metering
are being used.

It should go without saying that those six functions should be
orthogonal to the mode-selection function. I wouldn't mind if
mode-selection were to require two hands; right now it requires only
one, which illustrates the poor sense of priorities in the current
design. Zoom, spot-control, and one other function can be
conveniently controlled, which means three of the six functions
cannot.

<b>USB Limitations</b>
The USB interface is horribly limited. Apparently it can do file
transfer an nothing else. This is in contrast with other brands, and
indeed early Coolpix models, where you could at least perform shutter
release via USB.

The camera ships with a CDROM containing a bunch of Nikon software for
doing image transfers. I cannot imagine why anybody would install the
software. The camera appears on the USB bus as a standard
mass-storage device. This means you can plug it into just about any
computer (Linux, Macintosh, Microsoft) and transfer the pictures as
ordinary .jpg files.

Since they went to the trouble of providing a USB interface, I was
hoping they would provide full USB control of the camera. I would
have liked to use the camera to take a series of time-lapse photos:
Using software such as PhotoPC (reference 2) via USB, I would
like to set the focus and exposure et cetera, release the shutter,
transfer the .jpg file, wait, and iterate. But no; Nikon wants you to
just take pictures manually and then transfer the files.

You can't take pictures (manually or otherwise) while the USB cable is
connected. All camera functions including the LCD display shut down
when the USB cable is connected.

To perform remote shutter release, Nikon wants you to
buy an expensive, non-USB, non-computer-compatible widget.
However, according to reference 3, you can make your own cable
and control the shutter release from your computer via the serial port
(not USB). I haven't tried this, and I don't know whether it is
possible to use the serial channel for file transfer or any purpose other
than simple shutter release.

<b>Summary</b>
You can take very good pictures with this camera.
But in this price range, I would have expected a much better-designed
user interface and a much more capable USB interface.
