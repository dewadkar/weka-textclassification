            I decided that with the New Year I would challenge myself a bit and write a review on my car. *gulp*

My car is a <b>1992 Plymouth Acclaim</b> white four door sedan, that I bought from my oldest daughter when she bought a new mini van a couple of years ago.  It has been a reliable car for me and looks exactly like the picture on this epinion.

<b>Technical Stuff</b>***

While I know a little of the technical stuff about my car, there was so much that I didn't know and used my owner's manual and epinions to find out more.

<b>More</b>

The interior is a medium gray clot and is totally intact.  That impresses me, since the car is 12 years old and has over 125,000 miles on it.  The interior has really held up well and looks fresh and well cared for.  This sturdy interior has kept the car looking on the new side. 

As I said, there are four doors but the back doors do have the adjustable child locks that can be used if you are transporting children and don&#146t want to have a door accidentally opened.

Unfortunately, I don&#146t have the automatic door locks, so each door has to be hand locked and unlocked.  Not a big deal for me where I live, because we don&#146t often lock the doors, unless we&#146ve been shopping and I have packages in the car.  

I also have manual windows.  Remember those?  Yep, I have to roll them down and up by turning the crank handle.  I love automatic windows and this would be the one thing I would change about my car if I could.  Boy, does that sound lazy.

The trunk is a very good size for a mid size car.  I&#146ve carried quite a bit in there, with the spare tire sheltered under the floor space, leaving the whole trunk for all those bowling balls, strollers, car seats and groceries that I need to carry.

The front bench seat will seat two very comfortably, but also has a lap belt that can make it seat three.  I haven&#146t had to this yet, and don&#146t think the space would be enough to not feel very crowded.  In the front seat there is a pull down arm rest in the center that can be used by two front seat passengers.  I usually have this up, but for long trips I can see where it would be nice to able to rest your arm on while traveling.  Both front seats have shoulder/lap unibelts. 

The front seat also includes a drivers side airbag, that is mounted inside of the steering wheel and will deploy during a front impact accident.  I was happy to read that the airbag can be pushed back into the well that it came out of, in order to safely drive the vehicle, but of course will not offer airbag protection then.

The back bench seat will seat three, using shoulder/lap unibelts on the two outside seats and a lap belt only on the center seat.  I&#146ve only had three people in the back a few times and while it seemed roomy enough, I wouldn&#146t want to travel a long way that crowded in.  

My car came with an am/fm radio with cassette player.  Nothing remarkable here, it plays well and the outside antenna keeps my reception clear and noise free.  While I would prefer an in the window antenna&#133.I do like that I can have a cute little ear muffed Jack-in-the-Box guy adorning the top of the antenna.  (J in the B is a fast food restaurant that we use to get great Oreo Shakes from in California)

<b>My Feelings</b>

One of the things that I love about having this <b>Plymouth Acclaim</b> is its size.  It is not too big, nor too small.  I don&#146t ever feel cramped in and the leg room in both the front and back seats is ample.  It is very comfortable to drive or ride in.

The car handles really well and I feel as if I can make a u-turn or y-turn without any problem and in a relatively small space.

Although we have had to make a few repairs in the 2 plus years that we&#146ve had the car, nothing that we&#146ve had to have done was very expensive.  We had to replace the alternator belt and about a year later the timing belt but other than that we really haven&#146t had any problems.  These repairs have been under $200 total.  I&#146m very pleased with how inexpensive a car this seems to be to repair. 

The pick up speed is nothing to brag about, but I don&#146t seem to have a problem merging into traffic from a complete stop.  I will say that today as I was getting onto a freeway that was uphill I felt as if the car wouldn&#146t grab and get up to full speed until we leveled out a bit.  I&#146m glad that I don&#146t live where there are a lot of hills to contend with, because I think this cars get up and go is a little slow in that situation.

The shifting of my car is smooth and easy and I often don&#146t feel the shifting as it occurs.  I&#146ve never had any transmission problems nor did my daughter while she owned this car. 

I highly recommend this car for families or for those a little older who want a nice, comfortable, economical mid size car. 

I checked the value of this car in the Kelly Blue Book and found it to be valued at $725.00 but it is worth far more than that to me.
