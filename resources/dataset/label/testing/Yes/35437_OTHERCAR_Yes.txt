            I just purchased a 1993 Buick Le Sabre for my dependable; use for trips, as well as for work, car. I am really very pleased with this vehicle, so far.  I know nothing about mechanics of a car, so, I made it very plain to the dealer that I needed a car that would 'GET ME THERE', without me having to worry about it. The dealer is a fellow who has known our family for over 20 years. He realizes that I travel to buying markets for our store, that are 7 hour trips (one way) on mountainous roads. He has a wife who needs to travel a lot in her business, and understands what I mean when I say, &quot;Make it get me there, safely!&quot;.

This car is comfortable to drive. Everything about it seems to be automatic, including temperature control for the passenger side. (I like that, as the person I may be driving with is not always pleased with the same temperature I desire while on a trip.). There is a safety bag, but, only on the driver's side. There is an automatic lock and unlock on my key, and I enjoy that. That makes getting into a locked car at night, or any other time, really easy. I, often, have my hands really full when getting into the car, so that helps out.

The trunk is easily opened from the inside, as well as the gas opening is unlocked, from the inside, as well. The lights are placed differently than I have had before.  The light controls are on the driver's door. It works just fine, it just took a second to get used to that part. The mirror controls are, also, on the driver's door panel. The windows are all automatic, and controls are placed on the door panels. The heater is fast to be warm, and the defroster does its job in great time. There is a place where a small panel shows me the outside temperature, as well. 

The radio antenna is automatic, so I need not worry about vandals breaking it off, for the joy of doing just that. (After you have had that done a few times, it really gets irritating!). I have the interior that is a soft fabric, not the leather. Normally, I do prefer the leather interior, but, I have found this fabric to be very usable and it doesn't seem to pick up every piece of lint that gets near it! The steering wheel is totally adjustable, and since I am not very big, that is very handy. When we first bought the car, I couldn't see over the steering wheel, the way it was 'set'. It is fine now! I can see!

Gas mileage has proven to be very cost affective. Since the gasoline in our rural area costs a fortune, it is good to know that I am getting over 25 miles per gallon. 

The bucket seats in the front are comfortable and totally move up, down, back, and forward with automatic ease. The back seat is large, with leg room to spare. There are 4 doors, and that makes people and 'things' easy to get in and easy to help out!

I recommend this 1993 Buick Le Sabre to anyone who needs a dependable automobile. Dependable is the keyword for me. . .as I said, I am no mechanic. I believe that driving long distances are comfortable, not cramped, and that is a biggee for me. The lines of the design are very acceptable to me, and the car does present an understated elegance of its own. It didn't cost a fortune, it runs well, it looks a lot more expensive than I paid for it, it doesn't use too much gasoline, and it is comfortable.  That works for me!



I have been driving a Lincoln Continental for years, and I am happy to report that this vehicle seems as comfortable to drive, as the Lincoln did. Also, I like the idea that I am not in as large a car. This one doesn't feel like a boat, and I don't need to find such a large parking spot.
