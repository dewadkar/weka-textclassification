            The 2000 Maxima SE is a great car - the BOSE sound system makes long drives bearable. The console is well arranged. The fit and finish of the car seem excellent. Front seat comfy but snug/close.

The trunk appointments seem a little cheezy for a $25k car.

Changing a tire is fairly easy once you figure out how to use the jack-handle.

If the SE you are looking at has the Bridgestone Potenza RE92 17&quot; tires you need to ask some SERIOUS questions.

It is June 10, and since May 8th I've been riding on the donut!  I damaged the tire when I hit an object that looked like a clump of dirt and turned out to be a piece of cast-iron. Nobody, not even Bridgestone can get a replacement for this tire. It can cost anywhere from $205 to $230. AT LEAST buy a road-hazzard warranty from Firestone - Nissan says: &quot;Ain't my problem - see your warranty book&quot;.<br><br>
