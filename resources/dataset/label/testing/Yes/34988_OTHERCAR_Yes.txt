            When it came time to replace my 1988 Cougar, I did my research on the internet. I was looking for a 4 door passenger car with good pickup, comfortable ride, large truck. A nice, clean look was also important, as we keep our vehicles for a long time and I didn't want anything real &quot;trendy.&quot; Plus I wanted to get a good deal for my money. The 1999 Buick Century fit the bill. The ride is quiet. The stereo is great. Everything on the dashboard is easily accessible. This is a great car for anyone wanting a luxury sedan for a bargain price. I've owned the car for a year and there has been no maintenance problems.<br><br>
