                <b>T</b>oyota's advertisements boast that "the Corolla just wants to have fun." While this slogan would probably have been better suited for a more performance oriented car i.e., the Celica, the '03 Corolla is bound to transport their owners through many good times and memories.

  <b>F</b>or 2002, sold as a 2003 model the Toyota Corolla comes in 3 trim lines. Trim lines include, the base CE, the sporty S, and the luxurious LE (the LE was my tester and what this review is based on). Unfortunately only one engine is available, it's the 1.8 liter VVT engine that powers the base Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe. This engine is also the same engine that powered the Corolla last year, but with 5 added horses. The DOHC 1.8 liter engine pumps out 130 horsepower at 6,000 RPM, and 125 lb-ft of torque at 4,200 RPM. Transmissions include a 4-speed automatic, and a 5-speed manual transmission which is standard on all models, and was equipped on my tester.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i>

Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> is not exactly fast, but with only 130 horses it does quite well, and surpasses that of the Civic EX coupled with the 5-speed (see my review). The 5-speed manual gear-box shifts very well, and enables the driver to get the most out of this small 4-cylinder engine. The buzzy sound of the exhaust is noted in the vehicle on take-off, but this is to be expected with such a small engine, and  does not affect the driving experience unless you have 'ultra' sensitive ears, or you just can't stand the sound of small displacement engines. 

<b>Handling</b> in the redesigned Corolla is also very good. Like the engine, the Toyota Corolla's suspension is not exactly sporty, but it does allow for some good reflexes around sharp corners. Its front wheel drive manners are entirely predictable, although unlike many front wheel drive cars torque steer is next to none. 

<b>Cruising</b> in the 2003 Corolla is effortless. Despite being marketed as an economy car, the '03 Corolla demonstrates a remarkably smooth ride. Cruising at 65-70 MPH gives the driver and passenger relatively hushed transportation. Engine, wind, and road noise can get a little loud at around 80 MPH, but nobody (unless you are an ambulance driver, or, umm, errr... an amateur car tester...) should be traveling at this speed anyway. Hills are taken very well, many hills can be tackled in 5th gear, but many times the 5-speed tranny will need to be down-shifted to maintain a decent freeway speed. 

<b>Braking</b> is very good, my test LE came equipped with optional front disc, rear drum brakes with 4-wheel ABS. This braking set-up assured very quick stops even at high speeds. 

<b>Fuel Economy</b> is amazing, although I did not drive this car long enough to go through a full tank of gas, it is rated at 40 MPG on the freeway; very impressive. The fuel tank is 13 gallons, so on long trips gas stations will not be visited that often; not for gas anyway.


<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>  

The <b>interior</b> is not at all what you would expect from an economy car, especially a Corolla. For years it has been the Honda Civic that lead the way in 'top of the line' interior quality for economy cars; not the case for 2003. My LE was fully loaded with the Sunroof/leather package which added a rich touch to this econo cutie ($900 extra for the Sunroof/leather package). The instrumentation cluster is very easy to read, and the dash is very modern with simulated wood trim that surprisingly does not look tacky. Many sources, including <a href="/content_63004708484"> Motor Trend</a> and Cars.com have described this interior as "baby Lexus like." Modest chrome accents are distributed through the car, along with a boat load of standard amenities. Some noteworthy standard amenities on the LE are, tilt steering, dual front air bags, driver adjustments, tachometer, outside temp gauge, cup holders, a center console, and much more. <b>Toyota.com</b> is an excellent source for getting all the info on every amenity that will come with your Corolla. Optional amenities included, power sunroof, a fair sounding 6 speaker CD/cassette player, keyless entry, cruise control, power everything, leather seating and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Both the front and rear seats are very comfortable and supportive. The rear seats are 60/40 split and offer good room for 3 adults. The front is also roomy, and the drivers position is excellent; good rear, side, and outward vision.

<i>Exterior Innovation:</i> 

  The <b>exterior</b> of this car has received mixed reviews, some say "it's plain," some say "it's a girls car," I say "it's the best looking Corolla yet." If you have seen a 2002 Toyota Camry and like it but want something smaller, you'll love the cute Corolla. With its relatively bold front fascia, and its curvaceous body, the 2003 Corolla in a way looks like a mini Camry. I'm a woman so I might be a little partial to cute cars 9at least that is the stereotype, right?), but I think guys can appreciate the looks of this car as well. If not the LE trim, there is the S model which is much more sporty/masculine looking. This little 4 door sedan sits fairly high and also has a high roofline, so it really does not look nor feel like a small economy car.
 
<i>Price, Reliability, and Warranty:</i> 

The base CE models start at around $13,000 which represents an excellent value. The S model is slightly more, and my LE tester with all the preferred equipment had a sticker of almost $18,000. The Toyota Corolla has been a reliable car since its introduction in 1966, it has survived 9 generations, so I doubt this generation will be any different, however it is still too early to give a reliable comment on reliability. If anything does happen to your 2003 Toyota Corolla, Toyota offers a 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty, a 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper-bumper warranty, and 60 month, unlimited mileage body integrity warranty.


<i>Final Notes:</i>


 The Corolla represents an excellent value so common place with Toyota. With an abundant amount of standard equipment, good looks, price, and fuel economy close to what a 4-door hybrid vehicle receives, the Corolla is recommended to anyone looking for an affordable economy car on the new car market.
