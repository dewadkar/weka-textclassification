            After months of research, I decided to go with the Audi A4 1.8T for its exceptional value-for-money! 

Looks and Built:
After almost a year of ownership, still amazed by how handsome this car looks! From any angle, this car exudes class, sexiness, and luxury. The whole appearance is well balanced, not too exotic nor too bland. It blends in well with traffic and can command some occasional head-turning looks from onlookers. Like a well-heeled gentleman in an Armani suit! The interior is designed for comfort and luxury in mind without sacrificing safety. Gauges and panel are illuminated by a "cool" red glow at night, the 3-spoke steering wheel and the use of chrome and titanium ascents all give it a sporty feel. The only shortfall is the lack of leather upholstery as an option in the base model. 
The car feels solid overall even before driving it. The door closes with a heavy sounding thump rather than the cheap sounding metal and plastic clunk.  The fit and finish is first class with low gap tolerance, and amenities open and closes with a dampening motion (e.g. side-handle does not snap back when let go, ashtray does not spring open loudly)
Roominess score low points at the rear seat. It is rather cramped to seat anyone taller than 6-ft or trying to squeeze 3 adults in the back seat. There's also lack of room in the central console for random "stuff" and poorly designed cup holders. The trunk is very roomy for its class.

Engine and Handling:
Very smooth and the Turbo provides some needed "kick" for the small displacement engine. Gear-shifting is a joy and butterly smooth.  Powered-steering provides proper feedback, good road feel, not too heavy nor too light. Lack of low end torque might make you nervous merging to high speed traffic but once the rev pass 3000 rpm, the engine comes to life! Passing at highway speed is effortless without having to downshift. Wet traction is superb even in my non-quattro version. It is sheer joy to drive this fine automobile in a twisty country road! The cons are annoying wind noise at highway speed and engine noise. The cabin needs an improved sound insulation. 

Miscellaneous:
The 4 yr/50,000 mile F.O.C maintenance sweeten the deal even more! That ensures virtually trouble-free commute, road trip, joy ride for 4 years. Premium Package comes with powered sunroof (operated by a 180 degrees dial-an ingenious idea!), HID Xenon light that increases night visibility and looks cool, auto-dimming rear view and side mirror that increases comfort driving at night, and etc.
