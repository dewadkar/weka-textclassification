            While my regular car was in the shop during a major accident, I had the pleasure to drive a 2001 Chevy Malibu for about a week as a rental. I guess compared to my normal car, a 97 Nissan Sentra, anything better would have been more enjoyable to drive. But after having driven this car for the week and comparing it to a 2000 Ford Taurus that was rented for the next week, I would rather buy the Malibu as my next car over the Taurus. 

The seats were very comfortable, interior has plenty of room to feel even more comfortable, and the car actually accelerated instantly when you push on the gas pedal (there's quite a delay in the Sentra). The ride is quiet and this car would be ideal for long road trips with up to 4 people in the car. The exterior of the car I don't find particularly eye-catching, but I would prefer my car that way since the chances of getting a ticket would be less likely in a bland family sedan than a bright red or yellow 2-door sporty-looking car with a less powerful engine. 

The base sedan is quite affordable at under $18,000 MSRP, and it offers a lot for your money. The standard features of the car are better than most other cars: V6 engine, automatic transmission, a/c (very important where I live!), ABS brakes (I believe safety features like ABS should not cost extra on cars), and power door locks (all 4-doors should have this). The rental car I had was the base model with a couple of add-on features, and I would probably buy the LS model which adds a lot of extra features such as remote keyless entry, power trunk release (I find this pretty important after breaking a key in the trunk lock of my Sentra), power windows, seats, and mirrors, foglamps, etc. and add the electric sunroof (making the MSRP over $20,000 but still under $21,000)

I plan to purchase a new car in the near future and the Malibu is at the top of my list.
