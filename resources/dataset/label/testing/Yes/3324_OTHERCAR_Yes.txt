            My mother and I do a great deal of travelling together and this is ALWAYS the car we take.  The Sub can go anywhere in any weather with absolutely zero worries.  We have never had any complaints about they way the car handles on the road-passing power on the freeway, climbing power on hilly mountain roads, All Wheel Drive for off road and foul weather, and the engines never seem to run out.

We do, however, have a couple complaints about the comfort of the ride.  I don't know who thought these seats were a good idea, but I hope whoever designed them has been fired or worse.  They are instruments of torture.  They curve in the wrong place for any height person.  I'm 5'4&quot;, mom is about 5'6&quot;, dad is about 5'9&quot; and my brother is a little over 6'.  We all hate the seats.  On our last trip, I did find them a bit more bearable if you put the headrest on backwards.  The car also has the vastly irritating self-buckling safety belts.  I always buckle up, without fail.  I don't need the car to remind me.  The belts attached to the door are always in the way.  The tracks the seat belts run in seem to hold up, though, unlike some of the others I've seen (Honda Civics and Dodge Colts, primarily).  

The windshield wipers are always a problem.  This car has been back to the dealership an obscene number of times about the windshield wipers.  They don't seem all that important until you're driving in a huge storm down I-5 between Portland and Corvallis, or taking the car up the ski hill for another wonderful winter day (but it's cold and snowing heavily).  All I can say is replace the blades often, but even then your windshield won't ever be wiped quite as well as you would desire.  

The reliability, fuel economy, and fun of these cars make them worth the money (especially if you can replace the seats-I recommend Riccaro if you can afford them).  If you want to get out and have fun in the great outdoors, this is definitely the car for you!
