            My husband and I needed new vehicles this year.  He commutes an hour in rush hour each way and I drive 95 miles each way to work plus site visits around the state.  We need cars that are reliable, but not necessarily racy.  I tend to favor imports, but my husband convinced me to take a look at the Cavalier.  I liked the look and the price.  Also, my father-in-law has a Cavalier that is several years old that has had very few problems.  We negotiated very good prices and financing at Courtesy Chevrolet in Phoenix, AZ, near where we live.

Both of us have been very happy with the purchases.  My husband got a bare-bones 2 door coupe with air conditioning and an alarm system.  Mine is the same model, but it has tilt-wheel, cruise control and a CD changer instead of a cassette player.  Our gas mileage is 30-34 mpg.  In the year that I have owned this car, it has been very reliable.  In about 28000 miles, I've had the emergency brake and battery replaced.  My husband's car has had no problems.

I highly recommend this car as reliable and affordable.
