            After doing quite a bit of research, I became convinced that the M-Class, the Lexus and the new BMW X5 are by far the safest SUVs out there.  Do your own work, but third-party information and my own experience will, I think, get you to the same place.  Body design, roll, steering, airbags, safetycage, braking, and nixing the BMW due to cost left me with the M and the Lexus.  I liked the M because it's a little bigger.  

Since I'm sounding like a dweeb, here are some other considerations:  The interior is stoic but classy and attractive with good visibility.  Very good sound system, good power (ML320) except with heavy loads and steep inclines.  Good legroom and cargo bay, very usable .
