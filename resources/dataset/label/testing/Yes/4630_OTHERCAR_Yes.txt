            To start off, we have always bought used vehicles, and the Cavalier was no different.  The car that we had prior to buying this car had died, in a big way - the mechanics didn't know if we needed a new engine or not - so we decided that we immediately needed a newer car.  

It's a 1996, and we got in 1997, so it was about 2 years old (new model years in cars start in September), and it was a prior rental car, as well.  We got it with about 36000 miles already on it, and it is now to about 65000.  It drives easily, and we have had no major problems with it, other than replacing two tires, a fan belt, and the fan for the heater/air conditioner.  This has been the lowest-costing car that we have ever owned, and we haven't figured out if it is because it is a fairly new car or because of the way it was built.

There are two things about the car that I don't like - the color, it's white, and gets dirty very quickly; and my butt got really sore on a car trip that we took to Canada, but it was only when I wasn't driving.  But other than those two things, which could be easily cured by a new coat of paint and a seat cushion, this car is a wonderful car, and I would recommend anyone who was out buying a mid-sized car, to go and test drive one.<br><br>
