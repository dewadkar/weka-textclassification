            <b>Picture yourself in this situation: you are car shopping for someone you really care about, and you want them to do the sensible thing. Sure, there are tons of cars out there that promise they can trek through the Serengeti, or beat the fastest car in the Indy 500. Let's face it... anyone been to Africa lately? A driver at the track? Anyone?</b>

So, I'm about to make a heinous recommendation to my &quot;I want something sporty&quot; girlfriend: the trustworthy Honda Accord. The way I see it, you really can't go wrong with this car. Here are my reasons why:

<b>EXTERIOR:  7</b>
Okay, so it's <b>a little boring</b>. In fact, my friend at the Honda/Acura dealer was a little surprised I didn't want to see the new S2000 instead. But the Accord DOES look stately. Maybe classy. Add some alloy wheels and it looks almost like an entry-level luxury sedan. To demonstrate: glance at the Lexus ES300 on this site. Then quickly look at the Accord again. I may be speaking heresy, but at a glance, the two look remarkably similar. Overall, the exterior implies dependability, functionality, and maybe a little fun, if you look hard enough.

<b>INTERIOR:  9</b>
The interior of the Honda Accord is <b>nearly flawless</b>. The seats are comfy, and the dash is the cleanest layout I have yet to see in a car. Everything is perfectly situated, and easy to operate. A few quirks exist, like oddly placed sunroof controls, a dash dimmer that sits BEHIND the wheel, and cup holders that open AWAY from you. But I'll forgive that. There is plenty of passenger room all around, even in the back. The trunk has been enlarged to hold 14 cubic feet of cargo. The climate control system is powerful with logical dials. The sound system is good for factory, but an upgrade wouldn't hurt, as I say for all Hondas. Still, I'm sure this interior is the envy of many car manufacturers.

<b>ENGINE:  8</b>
The 3.0L 200 HP V6 engine gives out 195 lb.-ft. of torque. While this is no sports car, the engine has <b>plenty of juice</b>. This engine is better classified as refined than sporty, anyway. Sure, it gives you a little kick if you floor it. But the shifting is incredibly smooth. Highway passing isn't a problem. My gripe with the V6 model is that no manual transmission is available. Only the four-bangers have it. (BUT- if you get a manual tranny you can't get ABS! Ain't that something?)

<b>HANDLING:  7</b>
If the Accord has any parallels to its pedestrian exterior, it's the handling. Not too fun. While the steering is impeccable, the Accord isn't the best dance partner. On hard turns, the tires give out and the rest of the body dips sharply as if to say &quot;HEY! You got me to go from point A to point B, remember?&quot; It's not terrible (7 out of 10 ain't bad)- but I still expected better. In short, it handles like a sedan (surprise) but <b>isn't much fun to drive.</b>

<b>RIDE:  8</b>
The Accord rides smoothly, *solidly*, and handles irregularities of city roads quite well. Pavement creases on highway bridges are nicely muffled. The Accord <b>rides very much like a luxury car</b>. The only exception is the excessive road hum at cruising speeds, and perhaps just a pinch too much engine noise.

<b>RELIABILITY:  10</b>
I don't think I have to tell you that Accords have always had <b>exemplary reliability</b>. No matter how many generations of the Accord go by (this is the sixth), the Accord stays true to its promise of dependability. Even despite the fact that it's put together here in the US of A (Marysville, OH). 

<b>VALUE:  8</b> 
The Accord will withstand the test of time... that's the car's main selling point. Only problem is: you're buying into the Honda name, which gets you <b>fewer features</b>. Base Accords come in pretty bare compared to competitors that cost less, offer extra goodies, and even have more... panache, let's say. Meanwhile, however, 4.8 million Accords have been sold since its conception, which says a lot about which selling points matter most. (Millions of Elvis fans can't be wrong, right?) 
<b>Honda Accord vs. Toyota Camry:</b>
The only car in this class that enjoys the same reliability as the Accord is the Toyota Camry. But, it costs more than the Accord, and in my opinion, is even MORE boring. Don't get me wrong- the Camry is a FINE car and may even have the more refined ride of the two. But if I had to pick, I'd take the Honda.

<b>THE VERDICT: AN EXCELLENT ALL-AROUNDER</b>
Whether or not you agree that the Accord is a little lackluster, the fact remains that this car is a <b>very smart buy</b>.
So, I submit this recommendation to you if you are looking for a dependable vehicle for yourself, your family, or someone who you'd like to do the sensible thing.
