            This is a very easy-to-live-with car.  That means that it's an excellent daily driver.  However, there are a few gripes that I must disclose before I rave about it.

The seats are probably the least comfortable bucket seats that I have tried.  Not only are they difficult to take long trips with, they don't provide much lateral support while cornering.  That is unfortunate since the steering is so much fun that you actually want to find curvy roads to drive on.

The handling is very predictable, which is to say it's safe.  It won't surprise you.  The front-disc/rear-drum brakes are good at stopping the car adequately but lack the feel of all-disc systems.

Power from the 4cylinder is sufficient since the curb weight of the car is relatively low (2,600 lbs).  This low curb weight is partly due to the widely celebrated composite door panels that don't dent and are lighter than steel.  However, those same panels also don't filter out the road and tire noise that you wouldn't notice in other cars.  I think that the road and tire noise is a small price to pay for the added performance and economy of light weight.

In hindsight, I would have preferred the manual transmission to the electronically controlled automatic that I ordered.  The auto. uses &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; to determine when to shift.  While this sounds all good and fancy, it actually interferes because it's shifting seems more arbitrary than calculated.  Especially when there is only 100 horsepower to propel the car, the transmission needs the precise control of the driver to be more effective.<br><br>
