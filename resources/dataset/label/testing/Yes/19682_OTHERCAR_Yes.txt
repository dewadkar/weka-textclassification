            My husband and I were looking for an affordable family car.  I wanted on that was safe and had four doors!  Car seats and a two door car don't mix!  He wanted one that had a lot of fancy bells and whistles.  We settled on the Saturn and have never regretted it.  What really impresses me with this company is how friendly they are.  I still get notes in the mail for Saturn.  I also loved the warranty, 75,000 or seven years.  They really stand behind that too.  When we purchased the car, we got a key chain with a 1-800 number to call for roadside assistants.  If the car breaks down, they will tow it to the nearest Saturn dealership to be fixed and give us a demo to drive until it is, FREE of charge!  It's a part of your warranty.  Amazing!  Plus, when i take the car in for an oil change, they detail it for me for FREE!  I will absolutely buy another Saturn.  I can not say enough about this car!<br><br>
