            My wife and I did a lot of internet research as well as leg work before we decided on the RAV4. We were still undecided until we saw a black RAV4 with the upgraded L package. We decided to buy it on the spot. 

We love the new body styling and by adding the upgraded L package to the SUV it looks great. The main features of the L package( rear spoiler, color keyed bumpers, side panels, and door handles) make for a great all around package. The hard cover over the exterior spare tire comes with a lockable clasp alas no lock .. Cheap!! Driving this little SUV is a sure sell. I agree with other reviews that I have read; if you live in a hilly region or spend a lot of time at high speeds(above 70) the engine gets a little winded. But, know this before you buy it. If you test drive it you know what you are getting into. The engine revs up quickly and tops out at 6500RPM and sounds great in the process. My main complaint is that it gets off from a stop without much UMPH!. Normal driving the engine is adequate .. even passing at 60 on the expressway is fine. Toyota claims 22-27 MPH with the automatic .. I am disappointed so far only 21.5 on the average with 50% thruway driving. Only 1200 miles .. should get better .. I hope.

The interior is well styled .. many neat little nooks, crannies, and compartments to store things. Seating is super with great lumbar support. Very comfortable. The 6 speaker radio(so far I have only found 4 of them) sounds great with plenty of audio power. My only complaints are the poor interior lighting .. cheap plastic roof fixtures that remind me of cheap foreign cars of the past, no lighting on the ignition key lock,and the lack of a variable  speed intermittent wiper control( only 1 speed available). I also have this annoying little rattle that the dealer has promised to find. Amazing amount of interior space in the back. A friend saw it and thought I had more storage space than his explorer.

So far just great .. a real eye catcher. Ride is quiet and solid with great handling. Not a real rough terrain vehicle but I had it at the beach on some pretty steep hills and it had no trouble. Enjoy!
