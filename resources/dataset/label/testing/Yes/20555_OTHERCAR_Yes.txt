            After test driving every known car in its class, it wasn't hard to decide this was the car for me.  I am constantly on the road, and needed a car that would be fun to drive, reliable, and comfortable.  This car was definately it!!!   In the 3.5 years I have owned this car I have put 240,000kms (approx 150,000 miles) on it and haven't had any major problems yet.  Car is comfortable to drive, seats are comfortable enough that after  10 hrs. of driving, I feel I could keep going.  Car has lots of pep to, easily speeds up to 90  mph when passing.  Suprising for having such a small motor.  The motor is a 4 cylinder 1.8L 16 valve DOHC, that pumps out 140 HP@6300 RPM, and 124 lbs of torque at 5200rpm.  The redline is at 6800 RPM. Being as this car is fairly light, this power sucks you back in your seat.  I have driven many cars having much more horsepower, yet didn't give you half the pickup of this car, fun fun fun.  And handling is a plus.  Easily eats corners in the mountians at 3-4 times the speed limit.  And gas milage is excellent, mine usually sits between 40-45 mpg (Imp. gallons).  

As for the negatives.  I noticed the front nose seems to have a bit of a paint problem, as it chips a bit to easily.  The cup holder is not big enought to hold even a bottle of pop (cans and small coffee cups only) and the intermittant wipers should read non-intermittant as there is only 3 settings, this is quite annoying when driving in a very light rain, as first setting only goes every 20 sec. and the second setting is to fast that wipers make noise because they are going across dry glass.  Another problem I have come across, is the hatch gas shocks seem a bit weak, in that I am now on my 3rd set.
