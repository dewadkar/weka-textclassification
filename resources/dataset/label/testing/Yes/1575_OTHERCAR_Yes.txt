            We just recently bought a used (1995) Dodge Caravan and love it.  I would highly recommend it.  Although it just has the one side door, I really like that anyway, since it sort of corrals the kids in one area.  My 3 year old and get in and buckler herself up and I can easily put my 1 year old in her carseat.  I thought it would be difficult leaning in there, but it's not.  The gas mileage is really good on the highway, and pretty good in town.  I wish there was a bit more storage room in the back area (suitcases, etc.) but still it's really a great van.  I would highly recommend this one.  I can't speak for the new ones, but if you're in the market and need a used van, the 1995 Dodge Caravan is a good bet!<br><br>
