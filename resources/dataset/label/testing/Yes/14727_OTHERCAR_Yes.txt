            I just recently sold my CRX :-( I loved that car. My new car (not new, but new to me), a 1994 Miata, has a LOT to live up to.

I bought a 1991 CRX in 1994 with 48,000 miles on it. From then until about a month and a half ago I put 110,000 miles on it; when I sold it there were almost 160,000. That whole time, the car was only in the shop ONCE for something other than routine maintenance, and even that was my fault (damaged brake disk rotors). All in all, it was an excellent car. It got me from Dallas to south Florida and back TWICE, countless trips to Oklahoma and Houston and Austin...and even to the point that I sold it the car would STILL get all the way up to the end of its 120 mph speedometer. 

There are so many advantages to this car that you just *don't* expect. My best friend (who is 6'4 and 250 pounds) fit quite comfortably in the passenger seat. When I moved to Florida, I could actually fit more stuff in the CRX than my roommate could fit in his Jeep. And I love the fact that it only seats two...this was for years my excuse to not be the one that drives everyone around.

Aside from being wonderfully functional and reliable, the car is *very* quick. Mine was the SI model, with the cute wheels and all. It was actually *fun* to maneuver around in traffic. It accelerates quite nicely, zooms in and out of tight spaces easily...not to mention you can park it in a closet.

One mishap...and sort of an odd one. The car attempted suicide. Yes, you read right. About three months ago I was driving down the road and *gasp* the 'check engine' light came on. All of a sudden I noticed that the car didn't really seem to be running right, either. I pulled over in a parking lot and saw smoke coming out of the hood, and I was thinking &quot;AWWW you made it this long, now is NOT a good time to die on me!&quot; So I pulled up the hood...and the car was on FIRE. I was slightly distressed. I ran around, got all my precious belongings out of the car ( I had *eight* Tori Amos cd's in there!) and ran across the street and called the fire department, who promptly arrived (and they were cute, too) and put out the fire. Three weeks and $3000 later (which my insurance covered in full, thank heavens) the Honda dealer told me the fire was caused by the catalyst, which got plugged up somehow, overheated, caught the rustproof undercoating on fire which in turn spread to a wiring harness...you get the picture.

Even though the car tried to kill itself and me I still love it. I just took that as a sign that it was time for a new car :P

Verdict: I loved this car. I would buy a new one if Honda still made them (maybe THEN I'd be willing to put up with their incredibly obnoxious dealers!) and I would recommend it to anyone.<br><br>
