            After one week, I think I am still in the romance period.  I love this camera.  My school bought a DSC-D700, and I have been the only one to use it so far.  The past week I have spent learning the intracacies of this camera and fooling around with settings.  I am not saying that I would ever buy one . .  I couldn't . .  but if given the coice between this camear and any SLR film camera on the market, I would have some serious considerations to make, because of the remarkable quality.  The only problem i have is that a SLR should have interchangable lenses.  The Sony does not.  If they decide to make a model in the future that has this capability, consider me one of the first in line to buy it.  Until then, I will have to hold off.  The 8 meg memory card seems a bit anemic for some of th ehigher settings on the camera, which can take up to 4 megs of memory per picture, but there are 32 and 64 megabyte versions on the market that will fit nicely with this camera.  Luckily there is a setting for much smaller pictures, which I recommend.  I don't like the filing system on this camera, or any other sony for that matter.  the numbering gets quite annoying.<br><br>
