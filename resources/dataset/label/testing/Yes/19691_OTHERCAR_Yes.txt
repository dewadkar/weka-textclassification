            Our first new car ever was a 1999 Saturn SL1 which we leased because the payments were almost the same AND they threw in free service and oil changes for 3 years! 
All I ever had to do was put in gas. 
Sweet! 

The SL1 is a light weight (2300 lbs) small car that is highly maneuverable, nimble and precise w/ little body roll. But, steering is very twitchy at high-speeds (Saturn fixed this in 2000) 

Cornering and turning are excellent as you can do a U-turn on a two lane road in only 37ft. Brakes are powerful and stops are short, and with the 5-speed and downshifting, it puts you in complete control. Shifts are short and precise and gearing is excellent. 

The 1.9 liter engine, although only 100hp @ 5000 rpm is perfectly matched to the 5-speed transmission and car's light weight. 
The SL1 is a sleeper (a fast car in disguise) and when pushed hard it will out perform most other small and midsize cars and a few sports cars! It is hilarious to see the look on someone's face when your mild mannered looking Saturn pulls away from a stop light from 0 to 40 in less than 3.5 second! That is because it generates 114ft-lbs of torque at only 2400 rpm! 

Tough body-armor: 
The plastic body panels have protected the car from shopping carts tree branches, baseballs, doors opening, and my daughters bike. I *saw* an accident with a Saturn SL where the car was shoved by a 18 wheeler in to a guard-rail. 
The plastic body panels blew apart but the driver (who was untouched) calmly walked out, picked up the body panels, 
put them in his trunk, and drove up to where the 18 wheeler was finally stopped. 

My only complaint is that the car (which is in fact my wifes) is too small as I am 6'3". 
I can fit, but long rides are uncomfortable. 

We love Saturn so much we are upgrading to an L100 (bigger car) when our lease is up. 
Good Price. Good Car. Great Service! 

I highly recommend this car!
