            I recently test drove this vehicle to determine whether or not it was worth saving 2,000 dollars by purchasing an Accord EX V6 or to just buy an Acura CL 3.2.  What I found out was quite surprising.

As many of us know, Acura and Honda are one in the same company.  They have both created such an extremely similar vehicle.  The EX V6 and the CL 3.2 are so similar in that they each have the same dimensions within an inch of each other, they each have leather, they each have a 6-Disc in dash CD changer, they each have a V6 engine, they each have large trunks, and they each have Sunroofs.  But it is the little things that separate the Accord from the CL.

For starters, the Accord has an optional security system which everyone should add on for an extra 600 dollars.  This is included with the base CL.

The Accord lacks dual exhaust with beautiful chrome tips like the CL and comes with a dinky little black pipe out the back.

The Accord comes with 200 Hp instead of the 225 that the CL provides.

The Accord comes with a 3 year warranty and the CL comes with a 4 year warranty.

The CL includes a replacement car when you need service while the Accord does not.

The Accord lacks the sensitive seats which deploy airbags depending on the weight of the person and the position of the person in the seat as well as the car.

There is also another small thing that makes the CL a better value than the Accord.  The CL for 2001 was recently redesigned and is a brand new chassis while the Accord is the same basic body style.  This will impact the resale of the car dramatically and you could make up the extra 2 or 3 grand you spend to buy a CL in the first place.

Overall....The Accord is not the best car in its price range and for an extra 2 or 3 grand is is amazingly surprising that Honda and Acura would make such a similar car that competes with itself when they are one in the same company.
