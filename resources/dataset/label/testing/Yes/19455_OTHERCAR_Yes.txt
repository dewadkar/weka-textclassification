            What a great car! This is a definite purchase to anyone who is looking to buy an SUV. I have a white Runner with silver triming on the rails, it looks sleek! The front has a lot of leg room, while the back is fairly spacious for most, but tall people will have some trouble. Acceleration is awesome for this beast, and max speed is decent for a car of this type. Steering is fairly loose in 4wheel drive mode, but very nice. Handling of course for a large SUV like this is not like a Porsche, but it handles nice on dry and wet roads alike. The seating is also very nice and comfortable, while the back is big enough to fit a refridgerator in if you knock out the back seats. <br><br>
