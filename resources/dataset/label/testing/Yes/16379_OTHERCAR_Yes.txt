            I purchased this camera about two weeks ago and it was very easy to use and the picture quality was great. It connects to any serial port, but  unless your purchase a optional power cord you will use a lot of batteries unloading the pictures into the computer. A solution I found was to purchase a flash card reader for 45.00. It connects to a USB port or a printer port. The USB connection is much faster. All you do is take the flash card out of the camera, load it into the reader click on the software and away it goes into the computer. No use of the camera which means no batteries to drain. The flash card reader acts like a zip drive with it's own drive letter in my computer. Saves time and money. I purchased Scan Disk ImageMate reader. Pictures can be opened in HP's software program or any program you may have. Well that's all and good luck.<br><br>
