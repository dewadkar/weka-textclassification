             As a mother of 6 children and 4 grandchildren, I need dependable and lots of room. With my Dodge Caravan I get both! When it comes to hauling the neighborhood kids to ball games or getting groceries I know I will have the room to do it. I have purchased several Dodge Vans and will continue to do so, relying on their dependability,style,versatility,
comfort, and all around good looks. I not only can seat many but if I need extra hauling space the seats quickly and easily come out to convert to a cargo type van.  We have taken it on many long and short trips and it is always relaxing to travel in with the seats that lay down for comfort and the roominess it provides, I like the ease of driving with the tilt steering and seats that move where you want them to.  My husband likes the van because he doesn't have to be constantly doing maintenance on it. It is a very tough,dependable vehicle to which we will purchase another when the need arises. If you are looking for a vehicle to stand up to endurance and comfort then I suggest you look into a Dodge Caravan.<br><br>
