            I'll try and keep this short, but the most important thing you should consider when buying one of these is you. What kind of person are you? It is too easy to be subjective when reviewing this vehicle and so I shall therefore try and be as clinical as possible.

First off, if you like the 'all the mod cons' or super comfortable vehicles like a Lexus, Camry, Accord, etc., you probably will not appreciate the Wrangler. It is a very 'raw' vehicle. It is noisy, a hard ride and very basic (at least the model I have is - 1993 4 Cylinder, soft top, manual, no A/C). I have heard the hard top does a lot to reduce the noise (perhaps there is more info on a hard top version in another review).

It suits me because it can take the kind of driving that I do and keeps me from speeding too much (which can get too tempting in those vehicles that give you the illusion you're driving slower than you are). I like basic vehicles because there is less that can go wrong. For the mechanics amongst you, there is plenty of room to work on the engine.

If you like the idea of the Wrangler but drive one of the above mentioned vehicles, you will need time to adjust to it. Be patient.

It is not the kind of car to take business associates out in. Unless you have a second car or your business is working for an off-road magazine, I suggest you try something else (caveat - I cannot speak for the later models).

Facts. My version has adequate performance (I knew ahead of time it was not a performance vehicle), however, I have not tried towing anything. Fuel consumption was OK - could get from South Bay (Silicon Valley) to Lake Tahoe on one tank. Quite reliable, some were recalled for a catalytic converter problem, so check for this. I had a fuel pump go bad (put this down to normal wear and tear) and some of the clutch fluid vanished so clutch would not engage any more (simply replaced clutch fluid - has not recurred). There is next to no luggage capacity unless there are only two of you. The Wrangler has to be the most 'accessorized' vehicles on the planet, so finding external racks, trunks, etc. to carry stuff is not a problem.

If you don't mind rough and tumble with some practical overtones, the Wrangler is a handy and fun vehicle.<br><br>
