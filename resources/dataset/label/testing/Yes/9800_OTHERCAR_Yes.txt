            I'd long admired the 1984 Lincoln Town Car a co-worker had driven:  classy looking, apparently dependable, and spacious.  So when I, in my mid-50's, decided to graduate from my 10-year-old Oldsmobile to a more substantial driving machine, my first thought turned to the Town Car.

My next move was to find one I could afford; I'm not physically capable of touring car lots, so I turned to the internet and found exactly what I wanted, a 1997 Executive Town Car with only 25,000 miles, from a company that deals in repossessions.  As I had done with my last car, and most folks think I'm nuts, I made an offer sight unseen, after I did the research on the title and recalls on the internet.  The representative drove it 70 miles to my credit union for me to see and drive, and we made the deal on the spot.  It is a beaut!  Drives like a dream, has 2 years warranty left.

For geezers like me who don't like the bubble look on almost all the new cars, I feel lucky to own the 1997 model, because it was the last year the classic lines were produced in the Town Car.  Also it is the year improvements were made to the steering, which make handling a V-8, rear-wheel drive much easier, especially in windy conditions.  The soundproofing is phenomenal.

While the fuel economy in such a geezermobile is nothing to brag about, I feel it is an appropriate trade-off for the comfort and reliability I sought.  My osteo-arthritic condition loves the soft ride.<br><br>
