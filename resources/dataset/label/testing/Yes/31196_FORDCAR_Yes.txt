            In a blunt way:  the Ford Mustang GT is fast, smooth, muscle and a gas guzzler.  

I used my Mustang to commute and that was a mistake.  Given that the current trend is high gas prices, I reccomend you consider this before buying the car.  

Don't forget, for the amount of money that you are paying for this car you have nothing but options.  

If you choose to purchase one i recomend: air conditioning, leather and a convertable top if you live in decent weather.  The hard tops tend to be low and if you are six foot tall or more you will find limited head space.  Also consider that if you are six foot or more tall, leg space can be an issue with these cars as well.<br><br>
