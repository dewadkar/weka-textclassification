            I have driven Hondas for over 20 years.  Recently, I purchased a '99 Honda Accord Coupe.  Previously, I had driven a Honda Civic EX for five years planning to give that car to my daughter when she was able to drive.  That day came and so did the new Accord.  Not belittling the Civic, it is a great car for the price and the reliability is excellent!  But coming home to the Accord was like settling into a luxury villa!  The handling, the ride, the performance has so much improved since that last 1979 Accord!  I actually do not mind driving in the Chicago traffic!  The 4 cylinder Accord has so much energy and easily glides to the higher speeds for expressways.  This car is solid yet your ride is smooth and effortless.  It was great coming home to the Accord!<br><br>
