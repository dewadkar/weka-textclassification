            Yes, you read the title of this epinion correctly...recently, my wife and I traded in her 1996 Lexus ES300 on a 1999 Nissan Maxima SE.  Don't get me wrong, the Lexus was a great car (see my review of it).  We were looking for something that was under warranty, since the factory warranty on the Lexus had recently expired.  

The Maxima has a great ride.  Very smooth over rough roads, and it handles very well.  When you're driving, the car feels much smaller than it really is.  The car is actually very roomy, much more interior room than the ES300.  There are not a lot of cars in the market right now that can blend sportiness with roominess.  You either have &quot;sporty&quot;, or you have &quot;big&quot;.  The Maxima definitely takes the cake in this category.  Wind and road noise are isolated from the cabin very well.  

The Maxima's engine has been on Car and Driver's 10 best list on multiple occasions for good reason.  It is a smooth and quiet engine with a wild side to it.  When asked, the engine pulls strong and confidently...and sounds pretty good at the same time.  For the car's size, acceleration is impressive.  

The Maxima may be a fairly common car, but it definitely turns heads.  The exterior styling is very distinct and sporty, especially in SE trim.  It looks and feels like a more expensive car.

When we bought the car, Nissan threw in a BUMPER TO BUMPER factory warranty for 5 years or 75,000 miles....that should tell you the confidence that they have in the dependability of this automobile. 
The dealership also threw in free oil changes every 3,000 miles for as long as we own the car.....not a bad deal. 

Overall, I don't miss the Lexus, and neither does my wife.  She loves driving the Maxima.  I think that it's a great car that will be dependable and fun for years to come.
