            I wanted an Aurora from the time they came out with it, but ended up buying other cars for other reasons. I finally got around to buying the 98 model. and I was not disappointed. The style is like no other on the road. And the handling is excellent with its wide stance and the Autobahn package. And the V-rated (150 MPH) tires.

The V8 delivers as much horsepower as a Camaro with its mini Cadillac Northstar engine. But you are dealing with a larger car, different gearing, and a smaller V8 so it won't have the off-line acceleration of a Camaro. And the full-time traction control eliminates almost any chance of squealing tires. But I would put it up against a Camaro at top-end performance and handling any day.  And the top-end German and Japanese imports as well with their narrow, easy-to-rollover stance which is not a lot different than their cheaper models.

The controls and gauges are really exceptional. They are easy to read and make you feel like you are truly in a cockpit instead of a car. The on-board computer is really remarkable. It tracks your gas mileage (very accurately, I checked), tells you how far you have left on your tank and warns when your gas is running low, monitors your driving and tells you when you need an oil change, tells you to add windshield washer fluid, when the trunk or a door is open, and a lot of other things.

The seats are remarkable. Both the driver and passenger are full power with up-down, forward-backward, tilt, and back tilt. The driver seat has 2 buttons to memorize the seat and mirror settings for the driver. There are also 2 lumbar support controls on each front door. The lumbar is split into upper and lower in each seat. The leather is really nice to sit in. 

The sun roof is another feature I like. You can just tilt the back open when it is raining or just not warm enough for the full effect. When it is clearer the sunroof actually slides back into the roof where it is protected and gives real good air circulation and a great view of the sun or moon and stars.

The dual climate controls are also good. Before when we travelled I would be wearing a t-shirt and my wife would be wearing a sweater.

Gas mileage actually surprised me. I tend to have somewhat of a lead foot (not too bad because I take care of my car.) For me I get around 20-22 driving back and forth to work. Highway varies but is somewhere between 26-30 depending on the speed with an optimal speed around 65-70.

Like anything it is not perfect, however. There are a couple of things that I would like to change. One is the gas pedal. On my 1999 GMC Sierra when you push on the gas it goes. When you let off it stops. The Aurora is a lot more subtle, maybe too much so. It allows you to fine-tune your speed. But it also takes a lot of pedal travel to get the power when you want it or need it. The other thing I would change is the steering wheel. The air conditioning and stereo controls are well placed. But the wheel itself is too far forward. This may be to accommodate larger people or for the air bag, I don't know why it is as far forward as it is. It is the only thing that keeps the cockpit from being perfectly designed for a true driver.

The bottom line is this is a driver's car. Not for those that think a hot car is laying rubber at a stoplight to impress the girl on the corner. This is designed for those that enjoy a winding mountain road or a cruise in the country. Or weaving around the lumbering SUV's. Or having just that little bit more to pass a Lexus or BMW on a freeway corner without pushing it.
