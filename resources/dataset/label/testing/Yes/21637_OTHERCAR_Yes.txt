            I had a hard time deciding between Kia and Hyundai when I decided to buy a new car. I finally opted for the Kia Spectra after many hours of research. Once I'd purchased the car I told anyone that would listen, "Have I told you how much I love my new car?"

I've owned my Kia Spectra for 20 months, and I've put over 25,000 miles on it. I'm hard on a car... a lot of short trips and I hardly ever get my oil changed on time. But the Kia Spectra has stood up to my abuse so far.

My favorite things:
   &#149 I love the handling of this car. I don't like big cars, and the Kia Spectra is just the right size to make me feel comfortable.
   &#149 I love the warranty and roadside assistance, although I've never needed either one.
   &#149 Gas mileage is great in this car! Even though I make a lot of short trips, I still average about 20 miles/ gallon.
   &#149 The price... a major concern for any single mom or hardworking person!

Things that need improvement:
   &#149 The seatbelt latch is very uncomfortable; it seems to be placed too close to the seat and is hard to get the seatbelt latched into place.
   &#149 The engine slows going up steep inclines. However, pushing the O/D button helps keep the speed up.
   &#149 A little slow to get going, but it's a 4 cylinder! Once it gets going it's fine. It even has a little kick when needed.

All in all, I've been extremely satisfied with my purchase. I needed a reliable car with good gas mileage that didn't cost an arm and a leg.
