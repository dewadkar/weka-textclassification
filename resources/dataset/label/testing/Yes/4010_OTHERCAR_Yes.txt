            I have driven a Saturn on a couple of occasions and liked them very much. However they were a bit too small for me(I'm 6'5&quot;). I always said that if Saturn made a bigger car I would buy it. Well, finally they did and I did! My wife needed a new car and we went and looked at the Saturn L series wagon and she loved it. The one we looked at had all the accessories that she wanted( which was all of them ) and it was comfortable for me to drive too. The dashboard is arranged  very well and everything is in easy reach. It has a V-6 engine which gives good power but still gets good mileage. We took a 500 mile trip and got 27 MPG. The sound system is excellent and easy to use. I think it is an all around great car. 

The Saturn buying experience is everything it is said to be. Absolutely no pressure and a lot of good helpful information. The salesman had answers too all the questions we had and was genuinely sincere. I is a little difficult getting used to the window switches being on the console between the seats but that is the only problem. 

I would definately rate this car a buy for someone wanting a good reliable car!<br><br>
