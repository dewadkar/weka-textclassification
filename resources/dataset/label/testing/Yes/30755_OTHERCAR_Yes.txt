               I wasn't expecting a lot out of a digital cam for under $300, but this little thing proved me wrong, big time! It's loaded with options. For instance; 3 different quality settings that allow you to determine the number of pictures you can capture before downloading them to the computer. Close-up mode. No flash mode. Timer. On-screen indexing allows you to view 9 pictures at a time on the lcd screen and edit or delete them individually or as a batch. One important feature that swung my decision towards this camera was that the lcd screen is protected behind a plastic housing, preventing damage. This was the only camera in this class I found with this feature. Another cool feature is slide show mode. You can plug the camera in instantly to a television and start a slide show which displays all the images on the television screen, one at a time, fading from one to the next; very nice for end of the day viewing with family after a wedding, hiking trip, etc.
   And the quality is incredible. 1.3 megapixel, dynamic color. The software that comes with the camera makes it extremely easy to upload the pictures to a website or send them e-mail. (takes me about 4 minutes from the time a take a picture until it's on my website)
   The only downside is that it does not come USB compatible, so it takes a while if you have a lot of images to download. Also the battery life is not great, as is typical with digital cameras. But overall, these flaws are outnumbered by the good things this camera has going for it. I highly recommend it.
