            We bought our 1999 chevy S~10 in May of last year.  It has been very dependable.  We had bought basically a stripped down model.

We traded in a 1992 chevy s~10 for the 1999.  The 1992 chevy was a total rattle bucket but other than that it was a great truck.  A little ugly until we added the extra accessories like the bug shield and the roll bar lights, which I must add made the truck look like a tough mean truck.  The lights were just huge.

We werent trading it in for the fact that it was a piece of junk or anything.  Husband thought he should get a brand new vehicle since the wife got one.  Being that we had just bought a brand new cavalier a couple months earlier, we couldnt afford much more than a basic model S~10.  We stuck with the same color red and a stick shift.  The only thing my husband really wanted was a 4.3 engine in his new truck.  Well they only had one on the lot with a 4.3 but it had absolutely nothing else.  No AC and absolutely ugly factory wheels.  The wheels really make the trucks look and I suggest getting something other than the factory wheels.  Now hes ready to trade the truck in for one with AC and a few more options.  Well he's gonna have to wait a few more months for that.

The truck is very dependable and strong.  We also have a boat and use the truck to pull the boat.  Its not all that bad looking really just the wheels need to be changed.  I would highly reccomend this truck if someone was looking for a compact truck.  Very reliable but not all that great in the rain or even an inch of snow.<br><br>
