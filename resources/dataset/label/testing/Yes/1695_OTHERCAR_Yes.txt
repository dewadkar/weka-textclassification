            First and foremost I just want to say I love Hondas. My first car was a Honda, and if I have my way I will be buried in one! So it was no surprise to anyone that when I traded in my Prelude for my new family wagon, it was a CRV. But ironically this is no family wagon, it is a fully functional family fun machine!

It drives wonderfully. It is quiet and smooth, and handles beautifully. There is plenty of room for a carseat, a stroller, two baskets of tennis balls, and anything your wife may choose to leave behind. For the last several months we have almost lived in this car, and there is still room for more.

Plus, there are a lot of fun features that come standard with the CRV. Things like a built in picnic table that stows away in the back (great for tailgate parties), a waterproof cooler, and a power outlet in the back that can be used for many things like portable TV'S and stereos. 

Also, it can drive through just about anything, despite what some &quot;other&quot; small utility vehicles manufactures may say. We drove through at least a foot and a half of snow to get to the store one day this winter. We were one of only a few people who were capable of braving the elements in our vehicle. And while we were there we didn't see any Kia Sportages!

Most important of all the CRV is a safe vehicle. When my daughter was a little over one month old, we were in a serious accident. We were rearended and were slammed into the person ahead of us. The impact was great enough where our airbags were deployed. We were all injury free, but the CRV was in need of $9,000 body work. After it was all fixed up the car ran like new, like nothing had happened to it!  

We chose to get the four wheel drive model. It is actually called &quot;Realtime Four Wheel Drive&quot; which means the car will automatically go into 4WD when needed (see reference to snow above). It isn't designed for serious off roading, but it will get you through those unexpected mudholes out by Uncle Ted's Trailer! 

I would recommend this vehicle to people like my wife and I, young married couple with a young child. This is the car for you. Or if you are single and like to have a fun car to take camping in the mountains, or to the beach for surfing, this is the car for you too. Just have fun with it!<br><br>
