            We purchased our Focus wagon when they first came out...  We had after-market leather seats installed (a MUST for our family...dogs and toddler).  We have had only two actual problems with the car... we went camping and slept in back with the seats folded down.  When we went to leave and put our daughters carseat back in the car the seatbelt had "seized" and would not allow us to put it in the upright position.  We cut the seatbelt so we could get our daughter in the car, and the dealership was super and fixed it under warranty.  I believe this item has recently been recalled.  The other problem was...one time our tailgate closed on a stroller (just sort of hit it) and apparently became latched in the wrong position, so the gate wouldn't open or close fully.  Again the dealership fixed it under warranty...no problem.  

One significant negative is the numerous times we've had to take the car in for recall work...we live close to the dealer but if you lived a good distance it would be a MAJOR problem.
