            Well i was turned on to these type of cars about nine years ago and i have been hooked ever since.  They get about 30 mile to the gallon and i have found that they do not end of in the shop alot maybe a couple of times a year.  And lets just say that it does make it to the shop the parts are not too high priced like the foriegn cars.  You can generally find these cars for really cheap.  I purchased my for 100 dollars and i put about a 100 dollars in to it at first to get it road worthy.  <br><br>
