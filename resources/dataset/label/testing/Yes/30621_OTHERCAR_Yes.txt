            As a previous owner of a '97 Aurora and the present owner of a 2001 Aurora 4.0, I can confidently state that the new Aurora is a superior car in every way to the original.  The original Aurora, while beautifully styled, is too large and heavy.  The interior space is not proportionate to the exterior dimensions--the driver's seat is too confining because of the large center console, high cowl, and severely raked windshield and roof line.  The trunk, while large has a very small opening and high lift over.  The smooth V8 feels overburdened and the suspension and steering are lethargic.  The 2001 Aurora 4.0 has the same great V8, but it now runs on regular fuel vs. premium as in the previous version.  The new Aurora weighs less, so the same 250 horsepower engine is much more responsive.  The handling too has greatly benefited from the weight reduction without compromising ride quality.  The steering is quick, nicely weighted and provides much better road feel.  In addition to more space, the interior of the new Aurora boasts high quality, elegant and user friendly controls, a lower cowl, less confining center console, and front seats that provide ample adjustments and more comfort. The new Aurora is 6 inches shorter than the old, so something had to give and that was trunk space, however, cargo capacity in the new car is still aplenty, but it is much more usable because of the larger opening and lower lift over.  The styling of the new Aurora is quite striking, although less unique than the original.  I also own a European import and I take pride in the fact that in my garage, next to my import sits an American built auto that measures equally in quality, style, safety, and driving pleasure to the import and the 2001 Aurora 4.0 does just that!           <br><br>
