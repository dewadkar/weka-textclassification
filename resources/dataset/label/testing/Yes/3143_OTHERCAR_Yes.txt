            In April, my wife and I decided we needed to purchase a new vehicle. After much searching, we settled on the inexpensive, yet luxurious Hyundai Elantra. We have been very pleased with our decision. Not only does the vehicle drive like a much more expensive automobile, but Hyundai offers a warranty that simply cannot be beat (10 year, 100,000 mile powertrain warranty and a 5 year, 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. We paid $12,500 for the automobile, but I imagine it can be purchased for a little less at the end of year. Although the vehicle is tight and dependable, it is relatively small. It is a good vehicle for a couple or a small family (no more than four people). Another impressive thing about buying our Hyundai is that we were not pressured by salespeople - they were very laid back and allowed us the time we needed to make a good decision. Good luck with your car buying!<br><br>
