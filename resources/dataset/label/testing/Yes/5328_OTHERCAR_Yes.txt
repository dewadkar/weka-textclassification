            1998 Accord EX V-6 automatic. First year of the new body style.

This car is quite well made, and only exhibits a rattle from the sunroof after 55K miles. 
Typically good Honda reliablilty, its only needed regular services.
The VTEC V-6 is strong with 200hp, and delivers its power smoothly. None of the 4 cylinder "step-up" feeling from the VTEC actuating is present in this engine.

The transmission however, is not as sorted out as it should be. It is slow to kick down, and baffingly still holds the downshifted gear if you let off the throttle suddenly. This results in a forward lurching motion that hardly inspires spirited motoring. Most other automatics will quickly shift up a gear or two, giving you unimpeded forward motion. It has the particular feeling of being rushed into production before all the details were ironed out.......

Ride is decent, but feels a bit wooden at times. It feels stiff without feeling sporting. Again, was this car rushed into production without proper development? Steering is direct and accurate. Brakes are strong and don't fade.

Mileage is low 20's city, mid to high 20's highway.

The interior is high quality and well appointed, with good materials and nice detailing.

The seats, however, are absolutely horrific for anyone with lower back problems. The lumbar is so pronounced even in its most recessed setting that it makes it all but impossible to be comfortable without putting a cushion down. The seat is also very hard. 

Trunk size is good, the fold down rear seat is a nice touch, and the car looks good. 

I'd be curious to drive subsequent model years of this vehicle, to see if the various shortcomings of this initial model year EX have been sorted out.
