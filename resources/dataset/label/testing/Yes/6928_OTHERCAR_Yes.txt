            I think this is one of the coolest most high-tech cars you can get.  And just because it has a small 1.0 3 cylinder engine, it has enough pep thanks to it's electric motor, to drive like a larger displacement 4 cylinder, ie. Honda Civics.  This car easily cruises in the fast lane going 80-85 mph and still gets over 55 mpg!

I went from a 12 cylinder BMW 850 with blistering performance to this Insight.  Why?  Because I was paying through the nose with gas and maintenance and I was sick of it!  Also, it was too great a temptation for me to race someone on the freeway at speeds over 120 mph so I knew I had to do something about it.  Even though I no longer have the performance aspect with my new Insight, it has the 2nd most desirable thing for guys:  TECHNOLOGY.  For me, everything has to be high-tech: my computer, my palm pilot, etc. so the Insight went very well with my other things.

Now for the cons, people have said that the sound system was very poor but that's only if you like totally blasting the sound.  I have no qualms about the sound system.  But since I did not have a CD unit and wanted one, I replaced the head unit with a Blaupunkt MP3000 mp3 unit and replaced the speakers for the heck of it.  After installing the new system and hearing the much better sound from the new speakers, I guess the other reviewers were right!

The other con is...generally speaking, people who own this car tend to be a bit homey/geeky/nerdy/etc.  Now no one that knows me will tell you I fit this category, but the very few drivers I've seen just did not look cool in this car.  Before I get any flames, I do want to say that I do respect all you Honda Insight drivers, I'm just voicing my opinion here.  I'm sure (at least I hope) there are plenty of cool drivers driving this awesome vehicle.

Finally, I am a family man and would never consider this vehicle if this was my only car because of its limited seating capacity.  I think I can easily stuff my 2 year old daughter and newborn in the back but of course that is unsafe!  Heheh.  I do have a Chevy Minivan for when I do go anywhere with my family.
