                I strongly believe that the Toyota 4Runner was a good choice for me.  I bought the car because I was looking for something that was roomy but was not a mini-van.  It is really fun to drive by yourself, but it also has enough room for a mid-sized family.  
    I love this car because it is fun to drive and has many convenient luxuries.  The automatic trunk window allows the air in your car to cool down faster and it also allows for longer objects to fit in the trunk. It also comes with power windows and power locks.  There are also luxurious options such as leather interior, CD player, sunroof, etc.  These all make your driving experience much more exciting.  The 4runner can also come in a wide variety of exterior colors.
    The 4runner is over-all well designed, but it has a few flaws.  The buttons on the dashboard are small and sometimes hard to find, especially when you are driving.  Miles per gallon of gas is low, so if you are a commuter, this car is probably not for you.  The stereo speakers in the back half of the car are horrible.  People sitting in the back seat cannot clearly hear the radio.  Also, I find this car is extremely hard to park in parking lots.  Often, it barely fits into the parking spaces...glad I didn't buy a Suburban.
