            Let's get one thing on the table at the start: my wife and I *LOVE* this vehicle.

I could write a multi-volume novel about the vehicle's neat features, but I'll try to summarize to the greatest extent possible.

TIGHT TURNING RADIUS, EASY TO PARK
Few would know this by looking, but the Element actually has a shorter wheelbase than the Civic.  Thus, if you can imagine how easy it is to park a small car like a Civic, think of how much easier it is to park an even smaller car.  There you have it, that's how easy it is to park an Element.  Nice.

POWER, TORQUE
In simple terms, the Element has decent low-end "off the line" acceleration, but it flags a bit at higher speeds (e.g. 65 or 70 and above).  Now, for a 4-cylinder, it cruises very nicely at those speeds (it's around 3000 RPM at 70MPH), it's just that you don't have much passing power left (unless, of course, you deactivate the overdrive by the click of a button on the shifter, then it's got all the power you need (at about 4500 RPM)).  For around-town use, the acceleration is more than adequate and even a bit fun.

SPACIOUS, ROOMY
What the Element lacks in wheelbase length, it more than makes up for in width and height.  While I don't recall the exact dimensions, I can say that it looks positively cavernous inside for a vehicle its size.  In fact, that's been the one common comment from everyone to whom I've shown our vehicle: "Wow, you've got a ton of room in there!"

The downside to the functional interior is that it only seats four people in four bucket seats.  The upside is that since the seats are bucket seats, they can be reclined to lay flat, stored up and into the side panels, removed entirely, etc.  Extremely versatile.

All doors open to 90 degrees in a clamshell or suicide-door fashion.  In other words, no support beams in the middle.  For the safety-conscious among us, the support beams exist inside the edges of each door, so that when the doors are closed they create a support beam, but when they're open there's nothing but open space.  Genious.

KID-FRIENDLY
We have two young boys.  Anyone with two young kids knows that cars become trashed in a hurry.  Crumbs everywhere, seat stains, carpet stains, etc.  The Element is impervious to such things, however: all seats are waterproof, and the interior flooring is a rubber-like substance that can quite literally be wiped off or even hosed out.  No staining this interior!

Also, kids hate car trips because, not only are they long, but they're long trips with nothing but a view of the back of their parents' heads.  Not so in the Element: the back seats are stadium seats, which means they're elevated so that those in the back can see over those in the front.  Our boys noticed a difference immediately (and so did we ... a lot less complaining during car trips; yeah!).

REAL-TIME ALL WHEEL DRIVE
The Element comes in two-wheel and all-wheel drive versions.  We opted for the top-of-the-line all-wheel drive version.  Frankly, it rocks.  It has an automatic system whereby it drives in two-wheel drive at all times (which saves gas mileage) until the system detects slippage in the drive wheels, at which point it instantly and automatically converts to all-wheel drive (which provides traction).  An ingenious system, and one that we've already tested on snowy, mountain roads.  Worked like a charm, with no need to distract oneself with getting out of the car or even pushing buttons to get the rear wheels engaged.  

LOTS OF AIRBAGS
Among other things included in the top-of-the-line EX model is side airbags in addition to the front airbags.  This is a great safety addition.

MISCELLANEOUS
Even on the top-of-the-line model that we bought, with literally each and every factory option, it did not include keyless entry.  That cost something like $266 extra as a dealer accessory.  I think that's a crappy way to do business, but I must admit that we bought it and that it works very well.  We also bought wheel locks as an aftermarket accessory.

What we most certainly did not need to buy as an aftermarket accessory was a new stereo.  This system packs a wallop for a factory-installed system.  270 watts, preamplified, 7 speakers (including subwoofer for nice bass), AM/FM/CD, and an auxiliary jack for an MP3 player.  It rocks.  Seriously.

All in all, we seriously love this car.  I was not thrilled with the looks (though my wife was), but I loved it for its functionality.  For the most part, we bought it for her.  However, having driven it a few times, and having taken it on a nice long road trip, I'm getting ready to trade in my car for an Element.
