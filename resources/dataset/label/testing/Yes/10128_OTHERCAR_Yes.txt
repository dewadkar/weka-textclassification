            For a long time, my neighbor had been pressuring me to buy one of these things.  I had a regular Suburban and thought, what could the difference be?  Well after getting one, I see the only similarity is the fact that they are made by GMC.  With the Denali's 6.0 Litre V8 engine pushing out 320hp, there is over abundance of power.  One thing I did not like about it is the fact that since now GMC puts the spare tire under the car instead of in the back, they had to shrink the gas tank from its old 44 gallons to about 38 gallons.  Instead of a four wheel drive system, it has an all wheel drive system making it very easy to control on any road condition as well as providing a super soft ride.  The stereo is a Bose system with wireless headphones for the back seats so you don't have to listen to the same music as the kids.  There is and optional entertainment system that is a very nice addition that makes video games, DVDs, and VHS playable while on the road.  The seats are also very comfortable for long drives and the turning capability is incredible.  OnStar is also standard in the vehicle so you don't have to worry about getting lost or if any emergency comes up, they are watching over you.  This vehicle is one of my favorite SUV's because it is not only a very pretty machine, but functional and practical at the same time.  I highly suggest you test drive one.
