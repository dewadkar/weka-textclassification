            We ordered our Dodge Ram Quad Cab 1500 when they were first produced in 1998.  We got it two days before Thanksgiving in 1997 and took it on the road immediately to visit relatives.  We now fight over who gets to drive it!  We use the truck from anything to pulling a boat, horse trailer or to take on long road trips.  This truck has not failed and continues to become one of the best buys we have ever made.  It is two years old now and we have not had to do anything to it.  It runs like a top.

We heard terrible things about Dodge before and after we got our truck, but this is great truck!  We are considering now buying a Durango.  This truck is fit not only for males but females as well.  The visibility the truck provides is excellent.  I think anyone looking for a truck whether it is for your daughter to drive to school or for you to haul feed and do dirty work...this is the truck for you.  The Quad Cab is great for hauling kids or groceries, it is must have!  It not only runs great....Dodge's look tough! <br><br>
