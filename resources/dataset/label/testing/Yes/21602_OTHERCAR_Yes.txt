            We bought our van from my parents. It's a 97 Dodge Ram conversion van with the short wheel base. It has the 3.9 magnum V-6, that gives us all the power we need. 
We went to Arizona and back to Missouri last March. It made it a great trip. We pulled our pop up camper on the trip. We went through a big snow storm that lasted from Albuquerque NM, all the way to central Kansas. It drove like a dream through the snow. It didn't even spin out. There were several other vehicles in the ditch. 

We have a TV VCR combo with remote, that makes the travel even more convenient. It's very roomy and comfortable. It has 4 captain chairs, and a bench seat that lays down into a bed. It also has a 35 gal gas tank. We can go 450-500 miles before stopping for gas. 

It's a family traveling van. If you like travel with lots of room, then the Dodge van is for you.

The only thing that We've had to take it to the shop for is the low note in the horn went out, and they had a recall on the driver side airbag. There was some part they had to replace in the air bag. I guess some people were having them go off for no reason. I'm glad we got that fixed.<br><br>
