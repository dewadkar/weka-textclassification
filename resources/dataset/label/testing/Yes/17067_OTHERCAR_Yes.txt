            <b>Intro:</b>
The Audi A4 2.8 Quattro is one of the best buys currently. Here are a few of the reasons why.

<b>Handling:</b>
This is where the A4 blows away the competition. The handling is probably the best I've seen, nearly surpassing my 2001 Porsche 911 Turbo and my 1993 Porsche 944 Tubo S. The steering is great, but only if you enjoy a heavy, direct feel. The steering wheel itself is small, fitting nicely in your hands. The quattro makes you feel like you have a tank in the winters, keeping the car from skids in nearly every situation.

<b>Driving:</b>
The car accelerates great once you are out of first gear. That is the only complaint I have about it. If some more power could be given to the first gear, which has been improved in the newest model, then the car would be perfect. Fifth gear is odd compared to many other cars, because it actually does have a good deal of pull, as opposed to being only an overdrive.

<b>Interior:</b>
The A4's interior is in a class of its own. Cup holders come standard but that is only a small addition. Mainly it is the superior Audi design that makes you truly feel as though you are in a luxury sports sedan. The only problem is that a large person will often have difficulty sitting in the back seat. It can be done, it will just be somewhat tight.

<b>Exterior:</b>
Although I do feel that some cars, such as the BMW M3 have a nicer style to them than the Audi A4, it is still a great design. One word of advice, dont put a spoiler on the car, it will look somewhat ridiculous.

<b>Conclusion:</b>
If you are in the market for a car around the price of an Audi A4, dont bother with the competition. The A4 blows them away. If you have some extra money to spend and are just looking for a car like the A4, I would recommend testing the M3 and the S4, both of which have more power than you need.
