            Excellent for the "advanced" amateur photographer who desires controllable features. Not bad for a point and click, although I wouldn't buy it for that reason. I was able to instruct my wife to turn it on and aim, not bad pictures. The paper book manual is not complete, you need to view the CD. 

The LCD is kinda neat, but it could have been a tad larger and why only a few degrees tilt down. You can't see it when holding it above your head as I do for many crowd shots. One reviewer was correct that some CF cards don't work. I bought a 256 Kingston on sale for $39.00 and that works great. 

I have two sets of rechargeable batteries, highly recommend this. I use a set of "regular" batts to save the stored info when I charge both sets at one time. You will have to read the "CD" manual and experiment. You will not just pick up the camera and hope to understand the "many" professional features by guessing at the buttons. 

I particularly like the f/1.8 lens, 1/2000 sec speed and 64 ISO. I would have liked to have an aperture much greater (smaller) than f /8.0. Olympus missed the boat with only a 3x optical, should be 8x at least. It is annoying when I forget to save my settings (my mode) and turn the camera off. The camera resets to factory. E.G. you want flash off, resets to flash on (auto). You had better save that feature. 

The "digi-cam" is neat, took a 20 sec "movie" at the Pepsi 400 and the sound was good, again not bad. I took fireworks pics and 5 out of the 60 taken we darn nice, next year the ratio will be better. Here you have to read the manual and understand "noise" in "slow" shutter speeds at night.

I would also recommend taking all photographs with just a tad of zoom to remove edge "problems". I like the ability to reduce the flash when you see that has been too much. You you need a program to determine the firmware version of your camera, search for "ExifRead.exe", version 78 is current. 

Lastly, the camera is excellent, but I would not recommend it to someone new in the photography world. Too much camera and it will be intimidating to those people and their pictures will probably will look like, well you know.
