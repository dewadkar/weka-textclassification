            I'm doing a review of the Hyundai accent base model 1996. This car has gained an ill-deserved reputation it seems.  Practically everywhere I've researched this car, an overwhelming amount of people seemed to be down on this little car.

My girlfriend was in need of an economy car to get back and forth to work.  We looked at hundreds of deals and not so good deals. We both decided we needed economy cars that weren't expensive to maintain and gas up. My girlfriend finally hopped into this '96 Hyundai Accent for sale from a local Dealer sitting freshly washed in the lot right around the corner from our home.  She drove it for 20 minutes and fell in love with it.  All of a sudden that Saturn station wagon was all but forgotten.  Seeing as how she only had $5,000 to work with this seemed like a good deal.  The car had 81,000K  on it when she drove it home last month.  Very clean and runs like new.

Here's my beef with consumers out there who knock this car as if it was a lemon or something.  I have driven this car off and on since we've owned it.  The Accent is NOT a Nissan Maxima!!!  It only has a 1.5 liter engine in it.  If you own this car it's wise to drive it gently and accelerate moderatlely.  The chief complaint I've seen on this model is that "it's way slow and doesn't accelerate fast enough".  Hello!!!!!  Maybe because the engine is tiny and it's a sub-compact economy car....point A-B and the Accent will get you there if you treat it well.  People can be foolish sometimes.  In a nutshell...the Accent is a great little car with some room inside...I'm 300 lbs.  you can't buy an economy car with a tiny engine and then complain because you cant dust those hot rodded V-6's.  You simply have to get used to going slower and giving the car a break uphills and such.  I tend to believe that the majority of those complaining about how horrible this car is....don't take car of their cars very well. I can tell you first hand that don't push it above 60, do the oil changes, look out for pot holes, and tune-ups will make a world of difference.  The little engine in our Accent purrs.  At the same time my girlfriend bought the Accent, I bought a Mazda 323....both excellent...I'm going to review that one soon.

Positives:

$11.00 to fill up/325 miles out of a tankful.
has Economy switch by automatic shift that lets you drive around town speeds while getting maximum gas economy.
good in snow
tight brakes
fun to drive
dependable
good seatbelt design
dual airbags
nice stereo and a/c for a base model
heater will roast you out like a turkey...A++
gas and trunk release on floor to your left.
car rides nice for an economy.
insurance was cheap
handles Very well, I am impressed.

Negatives:

Engine could be bigger but does fine.
plastic parts on some of the interior.
fragile door handles on inside and out.
seats could be a little more comfy

Regardless of the small engine,
the Accent is rather quick around town and easy to park and manuever.  Don't write this car off until you've tried it for yourself.  If you take care of this car, it will take care of you!
