            The 2002 Jetta GLS 1.8t is a great car.  I went to the VW dealer having done extensive research and knowing exactly what I wanted.  They had the car I wanted on site, and as soon as I pulled out of the lot I knew the car was mine!  The acceleration is incredible, the handling is great and the ride is exceptionally smooth.  The turbo is fun, the shifting is smooth.  

You definitely feel like you paid much more for the car than you actually did.  I recommend the sport luxury package (17" alloy wheels, sport suspension, sunroof) and also the winter package (heated seats, mirrors and washer nozzles).  A friend of mine purchased an A4 1.8t and spent quite a bit more for the same car (the only difference is that he has leather, and mine has the 17" wheels vs. his 15" wheels).  Of course, the A4 is a beautiful car, and it's difficult to compare the two beyond the sharing of the same engine.  

I used to have a Corrado G60 and I only wish that car had been equipped with the 1.8t.  The Germans make incredible cars, and the Jetta is no exception.  I guarantee the first time you drive the 1.8t you'll be laughing as you go through the gears.  The Jetta has made me enjoy driving once again.
