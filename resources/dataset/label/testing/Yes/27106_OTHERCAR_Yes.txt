            Now THIS is a sports car!! I love this car and almost everything about it! What can I say? :)
The 90s MR2 is almost to much fun, you find yourself attacking corners a little more aggressively each time. It's a rear-drive sports car, so if you're used to under-steering front-drive cars, you'd better be careful. 
The turbo has the ability to snap your head back and scare the heck out of you! It's 200hp engine is a little loud behind your head but hey, this isn't a commuter car, right? 
The seats are very comfy and go back pretty far back for a 2-seater. The interior is basic and well laid-out. Everything's easily within the driver's reach. The stock sound system is actually quite decent, though it's not going to rattle your neighbour's windows (which I think is a GOOD thing). 
The handling is very precise and the wheel gives you lots of feedback so you know exactly what the road's doing. Cornering is very different in this car with it's mid-engine, rear-drive configuration. You have to be aware of the over-steer and you can get yourself in trouble if you lift off the gas in a fast, tight corner. 
This is a great all-round sports car. It could probably be a little lighter, but hey, I think that's getting picky. <br><br>
