            I own this camera and I have lots of fun with it. I just use it to take pictures of me and my friends jumping around or roller skating or what ever. 

I got this camera so I could use it for fun, and so that I could put my pictures onto my computer and print them out, e-mail them, put as a backround, e.t.c.

I personally think the picture quality on this camera is pretty good for a digital camera. For professionals, it may not be your first chocie, but if you are looking for a good durable camera, that is easy to use, this is your best ticket.

First of all, this camera, is a tank. I've dropped it, scrached it, sat on it, and its been fine. In my opinion, that is one of the msot important things about a camera.

Now, this camera has three modes. Picture, Playback, and Video. Picture obviously takes a picture. The zoom on the camera is fairly good. So is the sharpness. They both fit my standards. On the picture menu, there are quality and flash settings. There is also macro, and a 10 second self-timer.Playback is to view your pictures and videos. There is an LCD screen on the back of the camera, so you can always view your clips and pics. On the playback menu you can delete your pictures too. In the Video mode, you can record up to 20 seconds of silent film on the camera. The quality is a little fuzzy, and the clip runs sorta slow. But I find the video feture to be quite handy at times.

This camera uses a fujifilm XD picture card. The one I have is a 32 mega byte card, which holds plenty of pics and video. The software that comes with the camera is PIXELA Image Mixer VCD for Finepix. Its a pretty basic software. Its just good for looking at your pics, and saving them on to your computer. If you want to edit your pictures or anything like that, get some extra software, like adobe photoshop.

This camera also uses 2 AA batteries. The only bad thing is that this camera goes through these two batteries like no tommorw. I reccomend that you always have extras, becuase you will need them. There is a reminder on the camera that will tell you if your batteries are low.

I get great use out of this camera, and I hope you do to. I've had this camera for a year now, and its never let me down.
