            This is my first digital camera.  I was so excited to get it.  I bought it off of ebay for $52.  I was a little leery at first.  I�d never bought an item for that much on ebay, even though that is cheap for digital camera.  Also, I really did not know much about digital cameras and what to look for but this seemed like a good price.  I needed an inexpensive camera to post up pictures on ebay and send my friends pictures though email.

So far, I have been very happy with this camera.  I feel like I got a great bargain.  This is a great camera for what I needed it for. Now, I don�t recommend this camera if you are a professional photographer or are interested in high quality pictures.  If I wanted to take pictures of something important like a vacation or a family event or something I would get a better camera.

<b>Advantages</b>
The camera was smaller than I expected.  It gets pretty good battery life and it comes with a power cord to help save your batteries.   It has an auto timer, flash control, shutter speed control, and some other neat features that I did not expect with such a cheap camera.  It is very easy to hook up to your computer or your TV.  It stores quite a few photos.  They say it stores at least 16 pictures, but I can always get more than 16.  I haven�t quite figured out what it depends on.  It also comes with a small strap to make it easy to carry around the camera.

<b>Disadvantages</b>
Like I said, this is not a high performance camera.  It should be used for just basic purposes.  The pictures come out a little blurry. I found they are less blurry if you use the auto timer and prop it up on something.  That way your slight hand movements while taking a picture will not affect the quality as much. It was a little confusing at first figuring out how to use all the features.  The handbook is pretty helpful, but the buttons are small on the back and it is sometimes hard to do what you want on the first try.  There is no LCD display on the camera so you do not know what your pictures look like until you download them on the computer.  Downloading is pretty easy, but it takes a while. But, maybe it�s just because I have a slow computer.  Sometimes the camera just turns off by itself.  Maybe the cord is loose?  You don�t lose any pictures when this happens but it can be a hassle.  Maybe if you use batteries it will not happen.

I have only had this camera for a few weeks but it fulfills the purpose for which I bought it.  If you are looking for an inexpensive camera just to use for fun, this is the one.  I suggest looking on ebay for it first since I think it sells for around $150 in stores.
