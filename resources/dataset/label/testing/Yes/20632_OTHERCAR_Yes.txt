            Some time ago I test drove a standard, 200 horsepower A6 and was not impressed.  This car, largely because of the lack of power, was not a fun car to drive.  Audi seems to have recognized this problem.  For 2000, they have added two engines to the A6 line-up: a turbo version of the regular six, good for 250 horsepower, and the eight from the A8, good for 300.  The turbo is also available with a 6-speed manual.  Intrigued, I did the only logical thing: I drove all three cars.  This review covers the 2.7T auto.  Two others cover the other two cars.

For my comments on the styling and interior features of the A6, see my review of the base car.  In sum, I find the unique styling appealing, if a bit round and bulky from some angles.  I believe Audi has the best designed interiors of any German automaker.  

One thing I would add is that the seats could be more supportive.  They are so firm you tend to sit on them rather than in them, and the side bolstering is rather weak.  Maybe the sport seats, not in any of the cars I drove, fix this problem.  This problem also seemed reduced with the Ambiance &quot;atmosphere.&quot;  The leather of this trim set is softer, allowing you to sink into the seat a little.  Though I prefer the appearance of the other trim packages, with their highly textured leathers, this one is the most comfortable.

That said, on to the performance of the turbo automatic.

This engine transforms the car.  Due to it's low, low torque peak, at 1850 rpm, it thrusts you back into your seat and holds you there.  Feels nice.  Really nice.

All-wheel-drive makes the application of this power to the tarmac foolproof.  Point the steering where you want the car to go, floor it, and the car goes there quickly, with no fuss.  Don't try this in a front-wheel-drive car--the wheel will simply pull you this way and that as the tires fight to stay on the ground.  And only try it in a rear-wheel-drive car if you're ready to ward off some severe oversteer with some expert opposite lock.  With the Quattro system, there's no such drama.  In the base car this made handling boring.  The chassis was so firmly rooted you couldn't get it to dance.  Here it allows you to exploit all the engine has to offer.  With this much power, the chassis dances again, but only in ways you want it to.

The Audi six is not the smoothest, perhaps because of its ninety degree layout, and not the sweetest sounding.  You hear mainly exhaust, and quite a bit of it when using a heavy foot.  You hear few sweet mechanical noises.  Still, while not intoxicating, the sound is not objectionable either.

The transmission upshifts smoothly and downshifts readily, contributing to a responsive powertrain.  I tried out the Tiptronic feature, where you shift it yourself.  Though my own car is a manual, I did not find the use of this feature intuitive.  I had to think too hard about when to upshift and downshift.  Also, what I really like about a good manual is you feel like you're shifting gears.  This isn't the case with any of the manumatics I've tried.  With them it's just like moving a switch, which is what it is after all.  So I'd personally just leave the thing in D.

Handling may be a bit too entertaining in this car.  Though the car tracks very well, as soon as you turn the wheel it responds very quickly right off center.  Perhaps too quickly.  This gave the car a slightly tippy feeling.  Still, I'd rather have this than slow steering.  With acclimation it could become entertaining.  The car leans quite a bit in heavy turns, but sticks, even with the rather skinny 215 tires.

Ride is standard German lux fare, firm but controlled.  You hear the bumps, and more than a little road noise for that matter, but it was never uncomfortable.

While the S4 was a blast to drive (see separate review), the A6 with the same engine was merely fun.  Why?  Though the extra bulk deserves some of the blame, I believe the driving position deserves much of it.  The dash and door sills are higher and further away in the A6, making you feel a bit isolated from what you're making the car do.  With the S4 you're right there, while with the A6 you're a touch distant.  I also didn't like the fact that I couldn't steer with my left hand and comfortably rest my elbow on the left armrest--it's too far away for this 5'9&quot; driver.

Ultimately, I found this the best driving of the three performance A6's.  When you also factor in that it's about 6k cheaper than the eight, it's clearly the best buy.<br><br>
