            When we moved here in early '98 we were at the point where we needed to purchase a new vehicle.  This time we didn't have to purchase based on finances, although the cost certainly was an important factor.  This was going to be a major purchase and required a lot of prayer, thought, research and patience. 

Over the years many people we knew owned Fords.  I was impressed with the reliability of the Ford vans, the Windstar and the Aerostar.  I had also watched a documentary on safety crash tests of various vans and both these models did very well. With that in mind we set out to find a van (or a wagon if those didn't pan out).  

Even though I said our decision wouldn't be based on finances...we soon came to realize that the re-sell value on both models were beyond our budget or it was older than we preferred.  After many months we determined that we weren't going to be able to purchase our "dream van" and redirected our search.  This search had also become "time sensitive" as our car needed major repairs that would use up our "down payment" we had saved.

We headed to the BIG city and one by one, ruled things out. As we were coming to the end of the last lot, there sat a 1993 Ford Aeorstar XLT!  And it was in our price range!!  When we questioned the price we were told "it had been a commuter van and had high mileage".  My husband inspected all the mechanical aspects while I checked out the inside.  We took it for a nice long test drive (got stuck in traffic), liked how it felt, the way it sounded and how it handled. It was in immaculate shape.

After MUCH discussion and more prayer, we decided to take a step of faith and see how the numbers would work out...they did (thank you, Lord) and we drove our new van home.  Since purchasing our van, we have put countless more miles on it and have had no major problems (just a brake light bulb that need to be replaced).  I can't even begin to convey how safe I feel in this van, as a driver or a passenger or what a wonderful "family" vehicle this has been.  We have been in the ministry since early '98 and don't get away much, so when we do it's for a long haul and with everything but the kitchen sink!  

I've been in vehicles that aren't comfortable for long trips, but this one is great.  We only have two children, so they each get a bench seat (cuts WAY down on fights).  The front passenger seat reclines and both the driver and passenger have an arm rest.  There is ample space in the back for hauling luggage or groceries.  The rear seat removes very easily for additional space if needed.  And with two teenagers, we are constantly hauling loads of kids and stuff.  

In addition to the comfort and dependability, safety was a major concern and I have listed those factors that I find favorable.  Please note that these factors are similar in content to a review I wrote on "why we chose a mini van".      

...It's a seven passenger van with lap and shoulder restraints and air bags (for the front driver and passenger). 
...I have never been comfortable with all electric windows and hate pop out windows, this has two sliders in addition to the two electric. 
...Having never driven anything of this size, handling was an issue for me. This van handles very well. The first time I saw it, I thought "this is going to be like driving a bus", but it's not at all like that.
...Before purchasing, we tried several other makes and models. I remember one van where the driver and front passenger were fogging up the front window we were so close and another where the seat directly behind the driver and front passenger had no leg room. I see both of those as huge issues in reference to a crash. With our Aerostar, we aren't boxed in or breathing down someone's neck.
...My favorite features are that the driver can lock all the doors, including the back hatch from the driver's seat and you are not able to start the engine unless the brake pedal is being held down.

It's used for long trips and dashing around town and performs equally well in town and on the open road.  It's even done some "four wheeling" as we live in the Sierra Foothills of Northern California and are often making trips up the side of a mountain!

All in all, this van has been a blessing and we are VERY pleased with its performance thus far and look forward to many more years of use.

UPDATE: Our 1993 Aerostar is 10 years old this year and we have just under a year to pay it off.  It is still running great without any major mechanical repairs.  We have however lost the use of our horn and cruise control and haven't been able to figure out why?  My husband replaced all the fuses to no avail and we haven't taken it in to be looked at yet.  But the engine is going strong.  Had to buy a new battery a few months back - but that's all.  We are getting ready to purchase a second vehicle - a compact for town and short trips, but plan on keeping the van for road trips.  When it comes to vacationing, I can't imagine not going in our van and even though it has over 130K miles, we expect it to travel quite a few more.
