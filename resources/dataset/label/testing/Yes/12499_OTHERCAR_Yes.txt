            I have been driving a Saab 9000 '89 for 5 years and I have never been disappointed. It never stalls and never dies. It starts under any condition hot or cold and never overheats in the hot sun. It has great pickup and great passing ability. I drive it hard and it is able to stand up to my drivng style. I like driving it \fast and I am able to. I freqently take it above 100 miles per hour, and it is quite smooth above those speends. It also gets very good mileage, both driving around town and on the highway. It is also very comfortable inside and long drivng trips are fine.<br><br>
