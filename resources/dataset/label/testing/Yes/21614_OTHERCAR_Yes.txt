            In March of 1994 we placed our order for one of the last 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokees to be produced in 1994.  We were replacing a Ford Taurus station wagon that had died right after the warranty expired(of course!) We were looking for a multi purpose vehicle.  We had been casually looking for close to 2 years investigating all sorts of sedans, vans and sports utility vehicles.  So when the Taurus engine died we traded it in on a 94 JEEP Grand Cherokee.  

We ordered our 1994 JEEP Grand Cherokee Laredo with the 4.0 L six cylinder engine, automatic, trailer tow package, Selec Trac NP242 transfer case, 3.73 rear axle ratio, A/C, skid plates and fog lamps. 

We chose the JEEP Grand Cherokee for several reasons.  The first reason was for safety with its standard anti lock brakes and a driver&#146s side airbag.  Mechanical reasons for our choice were the solid live Dana front axle, the manually shifted Select Trac NP242 transfer case and for the generous towing capacity of the JEEP with the inline 6 cylinder engine.  We loved the style, ride and also the performance in comparison to some of its rough riding, sluggish competitors.

As a backyard mechanic who has worked on vehicles all of my life I was not interested in a 4 wheel drive vehicle that I shifted by flicking electric buttons or switches on the dashboard.  To me that spelled expensive repairs.  By the same token I was not interested in independent front suspension.  That belongs on a sports car, family sedan or maybe an ATV.

My research also showed that JEEP Grand Cherokee's had tremendous capability off road.  Chrysler had actually designed in tremendous off road capability knowing full well that most Grand Cherokees would never leave the pavement. 

As of March 23, 2003 we have now driven this Jeep 355,000 kilometres which converts to about 220,000 miles. It has successfully navigated muddy back farm roads and fields with clients checking agricultural field crops as well as snow filled and icy roads in the winter.  In between it has been used for family vacations towing a heavy trailer, shopping and some limited off road exploring.    

In the summer we tow our 4,000-lb. tandem axle cabin camping trailer on vacations.  Our JEEP has towed this trailer every summer since 1994 to vacations through the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Montana and Wyoming, the Black Hills of South Dakota and many of the "flat" states and provinces in between.  Despite a total load of over 5,000 lbs. with passengers and luggage, we have never encountered a problem keeping up with traffic. During towing duty the over drive is switched off meaning the engine is running about 3,000 rpm's at 65 mph.  It will purr all day at that speed for hundreds of miles. We just returned on August 19th, 2002 from a 3,000 km or 1800 mile round trip through the Dakota's and Minnesota pulling our travel trailer.  NO problems even at our current high mileage level and NO oil consumption.  Average fuel mileage on the trip was 14.2 mpg to the Imperial gallon or about 12 mpg to the US gallon.

We are still running an original engine, transfer case, differentials.  I finally gave in and changed the shocks and rear coil springs at 350,000 kms.  I went to a MOOG CC721 Cargo coil which is better for towing or carrying heavy loads.  They seem to work very well but they do ride much stiffer.  

The transmission was rebuilt at about 60,000 miles (100,000 kms) but I believe this was a poor diagnosis by the dealership. (More on them later).  Our JEEP has always received regular, frequent maintenance and thus to this day the engine still does not burn any oil.  The original brakes lasted 140,000 kms and we just replaced the brake linings a second time at 270,000 kms.  We just installed our 4th set of tires at 300,000.  We could have gone considerably farther on each set of tires if we ran them to the maximum tread depth allowed by law but I do not feel that is safe. I recently changed the front U-Joints on the front differential as they finally wore out. The original radiator and heater hoses will get replaced as well.  

I recently pulled out all of the spark plugs to install new ones as well as changed the rotor, distributor cap and spark plug wires.  There was no unusual colouration on any of the spark plugs that would indicate problems.  This has been supported by the lack of oil consumption and also by the occasional analysis of crankcase oil.  For those of you who are not familiar with oil sampling there are laboratories that can take a sample of engine oil and analyze it for the type and concentration of mineral content.  Since there are many different mineral compounds used in building engine parts they can tell you if you have excess wear on a certain component by the the quantity of that component that shows up in the oil.  Hopefully this allows you to get your engine fixed before you damage other components.  In the region I live in this sampling costs about $10.00 US or $16.00 Cdn per oil sample through my local Caterpillar equipment dealer or through Exxon.


Our JEEP is frequently seen towing our other trailer, which is a 1974 Ford F350 box, frame and rear axle made into a handy utility trailer equipped with a factory FORD fibreglass shell.  We have towed this trailer on a 5,000-mile round trip to Hartford, Connecticut during the winter of 1997-1998 returning through Montreal, Quebec and Toronto Ontario just prior to the disastrous ice storm.  We left Montreal during a smaller freezing rainstorm on New Years day 1998.  There were hundreds of vehicles in the ditch on both sides of the divided Highway 401 between Montreal and Toronto. The slippery roads only meant we slowed down to an appropriate speed.  We never encountered any problems except a few extra hours behind the wheel in "Full Time" 4 wheel drive.  Several times during the trip we watched other drivers (including police) slide into the ditch sideways, backwards and forwards!

Love Versus Hate: 
We love every thing and hate nothing about this vehicle.
We would buy another one in an instant and actually we plan on picking up a good used 93-95 Grand Cherokee for a second vehicle.

Modifications to Date.
We did not make any modifications prior to the expiry of the 115,000-km warranty period.  In July 1997 the first item we added was a K & N reusable and cleanable air filter. We noticed a substantial improvement in the towing ability that summer but we were looking for still more performance.  In September of 1997 a friend and I installed a Borla stainless steel exhaust header along with a Dynomax cat back exhaust system. Acceleration was slightly improved as well as gas mileage but the real difference was noticed in towing the next summer.  The combination of the new exhaust system and the K & N air filter really flattened out the hills with the trailer hooked up behind.

In the summer of 2000 I installed an Autometer transmission temperature gauge to monitor transmission temperature in attempt to get as many miles out of this transmission as possible.  The surprising data it provided is that our transmission runs hotter commuting through the city than it does towing a 4-5,000 load on the highway. I now have an Autometer oil pressure, voltmeter and engine temperature gauge to install as my in dash voltmeter is finally giving out erroneous readings. 

Driving Style:
Driving this vehicle on dry pavement is very similar to driving a car until you get into the mud and snow.  I would encourage anyone buying an SUV or 4 x 4 pickup to take a course in driving your particular 4 x 4 vehicle to learn its limits and capabilities.  The driving techniques are very different from vans, cars and two wheel drive pickups. But they are not hard to learn. 

Even a difference in the type of 4-wheel drive transfer case will affect your driving style. For example a typical "part time" transfer case can be treacherous to drive on ice.  This is because the front and rear axles are locked together.  When you steer into a turn your front and rear axles want to turn at different speeds, as they are each on a different radius in the turn. This can cause your front wheels to lose traction and skid and thus you have lost control of your steering.  Knowing this several friends drive their 4 wheel drive trucks and SUVs in 2 wheel drive on ice to avoid ending up in the ditch upside down.  But JEEP has the answer with the Select Trac option.

Transfer Cases:
The NP242 Selec Trac transfer case used by Jeep offers both a "part time" mode for deep snow, mud, sand etc as well as a "Full Time" mode for all weather traction.  In "Full Time" there is a centre differential in the transfer case that is unlocked allowing the front axle to turn at a different speed from the rear axle.  This "Full Time" mode gives you the incredible traction of 4-wheel drive and allows you to keep that traction through tight turns on ice.  It's road manners are much more predictable on slippery surfaces than the new style "automatic" transfer cases available on some competitive SUV's  The NP242 Selec-Trac also allows you to drive in 4 wheel drive on dry pavement or intermittently icy roads where black ice may be present that you will not see until its too late.  Both of these types of surfaces can damage a "Part time" transfer case if it is engaged in 4-wheel drive for an extended period of time.  

Servicing Your JEEP:
Our biggest problem has been with poor service from our dealer.  When I pick up our JEEP at the dealer I have to check it over to see what they missed, didn't do or left loose or hanging.  To date I have found they have the left the hose from the air filter box to the throttle body unclamped many times, they left a new front differential vent tube dangling and dragging on the pavement, transmission cooler lines loose and leaking, no oil in the engine after an oil change and many lube jobs that meant my front driveshaft was never greased after continually telling the mechanic and service manager it was a custom driveshaft with grease nipples.

To be fair to our dealer there have been some incidents of excellent service as well.  I think part of the problem is that the labour allowance from the manufacturer on warranty repairs is only a small fraction of the time the repair will actually take. Thus service technicians get used to hurrying to finish a job and consequently miss some important details like adding oil to finish off an oil change!  

It is very important to take a look around and under your hood and car before leaving the dealership or service garage!! 

Do yourself a favour and buy a JEEP Grand Cherokee.
