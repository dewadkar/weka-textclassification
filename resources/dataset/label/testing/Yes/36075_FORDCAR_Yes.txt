            I do not own a Ford Focus, however, I was lucky enough to get one as a rental car a few months ago when the engine blew up on my Ford Expedition.  I drove the white Focus for over 3 weeks, and loved it.  

The body style is reminicent of a much more expensive car, and I got several comments from strangers about the car.  The lady at Burger King, the lady at the dry cleaners, and a couple of friends wanted to know what kind of car that was, etc.  This was just before Ford began their recent TV ads for the Focus. 

It handles great!  I had so much fun driving!  It was remenicnt of driving my Mustang as a teenager.  Cornering and acceleration are 
FUN in that car!  Granted, I have been driving an Expedition and before that an Explorer, but my husband drives a Lexus LS400, and while its handling is exquisite, it is not near as much fun running around town in as the Focus.  

The car I drove was white with grey interior.  The seats were very comfortable, although they only had 2 adjustment abilities.  The panel is easy to see and read, even at night.  The back seat was somewhat small, but had enough room for two kids to sit comfortably.  My 17 year old already has a car (another Mustang), but I would certainly consider the Focus as a great 1st car for anyone.  

I had enough space for groceries, etc.  And while I was riding rather close to the ground, I did not have the feel that I was looking UP at everyone else's bumper.  Ford has outdone themselves creating a compact car that has a much more expensive look, and is as much fun to drive as a small sports car!
