            Fun, versatile, and economical. Way to go, Toyota! I looked at Ford Focus, VW Golf, Honda Civic Si hatchback, and PT Cruiser, but the Matrix beats them all hands down in terms of standard features, quality and price. 

I'm thrilled with what I got on the base model with automatic: includes a/c and CD player standard plus lots of other fun stuff (tilt steering wheel, exterior temp display, digital odometer, extra cigarette outlet in armrest compartment for cell phone charging, 2 cargo nets, Matrix emblem carpet mats, etc). Lots more features available on the XR and XRS but I'm very happy with the price I paid. I'm also happy that I had no trouble actually finding a base model and didn't end up having to buy way more than I needed.

Ride: I find the 130 HP with automatic peppy enough for what I do: lots of in-town driving. Automatic is pretty smooth with decent acceleration. Suspension is firm (more sporty than sedan-like), steering is tight. 

Interior: chrome accents and surprisingly nice plastics and upholstery. Much nicer than anything I've looked at in a hatchback/small wagon at this price. controls are intuitive and ergonomic. I love the shifter built up on the dash rather than flat on floor. Cup holders are deep and stable. Seats are very comfortable for me (5'5") and give me good lumbar support. (More expensive models also give vertical seat height adjustment-- mine does not) Armrest is too low and far back for me to use comfortably, but the compartment is handy. There are a number of map pockets and hidden storage compartments readily accessible in the front seats. Passengers in the back have said it was pretty comfortable there too.

Exterior: indigo ink pearl paint is gorgeous! Lack of side moldings makes me a little nervous in terms of dings and scratches but I love the way it looks without them. The car looks deceptively small from the outside, though it is taller than most sedans.

cargo: the seats really do fold completely flat. It's very easy to get them down and up unlike some wagons. The hatchback area is covered in hard plastic rather than cloth. I thought it might look cheap, but the plastic is really nice. It's also much easier to keep clean than carpet. Comes with two cargo nets and lots of hooks and straps and fixtures for strapping things down. The tonneau cover is pretty flimsy, however.
