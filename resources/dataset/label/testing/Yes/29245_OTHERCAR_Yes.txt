            My husband just bought me a 4-door Blazer for Christmas. At first I was kind of skeptical because of it being a 4 wheel drive. I was afraid that it would not ride as smooth as the Dodge Intrepid that we traded for this Blazer. 

Boy was I wrong, it not only drives really smooth but also handles very well and the gas mileage is not as bad as you would think it would be with a V6.

 One of the reasons we decided to trade our car for this Blazer was because we are expecting an addition to the family in April. Not to mention the fact that we just moved to Kansas from Arizona  where it snows on a regular bases.

We had the experience of driving the Intrepid in the snow which was not a good idea. Of course we got stuck and my husband had to go home get his truck and pull us out.

Since then we have driven in the snow with the Blazer and had no problems at all. Not only do I love it but it is great vehicle if you have kids or travel with an animal. We have a English Bulldog that now fits comfortably in the cargo area with no problem. 

I would suggest if you are looking in the near future to buy an Sprt Utility Vehicle , stop at your local Chevy dealer and test drive a Blazer. You will not be disappointed.
