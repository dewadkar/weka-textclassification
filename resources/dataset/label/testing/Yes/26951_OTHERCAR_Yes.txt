            I bought this vehicle because it has many things to offer. I have the 1998 model. It is a fast car with a V6 engine and is a very smooth ride. From the time I first sat in it for a test drive, I really enjoyed it because it is very fun to drive and it's fairly quick. I drive this car everywhere I go and it is suitable for all occasions, not to mention it looks very nice. The only thing I don't like is the parts that Toyota uses on the outside of their cars. The parts are very cheap and are plastic which would mess up easily in an accident. Even though the car would mess up, you wouldn't because the car has airbags for safety. Also, even though the outside of the car is made up of a cheap material, the inside parts including the engine are very good and reliable so overall this is a great car and is recommended.<br><br>
