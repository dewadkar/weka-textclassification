            This review is actually for a 1994 Eagle Summit.  But for anyone who pays attention it is the same car.  Everything under the hood of my car, including the key, say Mitsubishi.  

I purchased the 94 Summit at 50,000 miles in 1998.  I noticed it in a newspaper ad for only $4,995.  I wasn't really looking for a car, but the Mirage/Summit had caught my eye.  I went down the the dealership with my father.  We took the car on a test drive and I decided to keep it for 24 hours.

Needless to say I took it home and had my father inspect it.  The exhaust was good, everything under the hood looked great.  Everything on the inside worked, and the cars shifting ability never missed.  The only thing different for me was not having power steering.  OK so I would get some muscles.  

So I took it to my own house and put it through all the tests that were given in two different &quot;How to Buy Used Cars&quot; books.  It passed every single test.  So I purchased the vehicle.

I have now owned the car for over 2 years and can say that this was the best deal I have ever made.  The car has had no type of problem ever!  The only thing I have had to do for it was give it a couple of new tires and oil changes.  

The bumpiness of a car ride is to be expected, it's not a Lexus.  It's an inexpensive compact car. The Summit has a great little engine in it.  It cleans up real shiny and people who don't know anything about cars think it's new when they see it.  I have the periwinkle color that came our with the grey bumpers in the front and back.  And personally I like this better than overall coloring.  If you put a little Armor-All on the bumpers they shine up and look great!!  

I currently also own a 96 Eclipse.  My husband sold his Civic and now drives my Summit.  It has given him no problems.  My husband has plans to buy an SUV in the fall, when this happens, we are seriously thinking of keeping the Summit as a third car because of how great it's been to both of us!!<br><br>
