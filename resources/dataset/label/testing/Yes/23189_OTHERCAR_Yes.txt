            I Love My Car!  Previously I had an 89' Honda Civic Hatchback, so I knew that honda meant reliability (200,000 miles +)!  Since my job requires me to be on the road just about 8 hours a day, it was very important for me to have a car that could handle that kind of driving.

I wanted to move into a larger car. We looked at several other makes and models, did the research, and went back to the Honda name.

I test-drove the Accord DX, LX and EX.  For the $$, the LX is worth every penny.  If I had to have the sunroof, CD player, etc... the EX would have been my choice.  

The ride is smooth and very comfortable.  I have a 6' son who has enough leg and head room in the back seat.  This Accord is a pleasure to drive.  So much so, that once my Grandmother rode in it, she decided that she wanted an Accord as well.  And, my husband who has been driving another make car, has decided to trade it in for an Accord.

This is a great small family car (1 or 2 children) or even 3 small children.  

What else can I say... aside from oil changes and regular maintenance, I have not had to put anything into this car. It is the best car I have ever owned.  And, when it's time for my next car... it will absolutely be another Accord!

Great gas mileage!  I've gotten as good as 34 mi/gal.  <br><br>
