            I have just completed an extended trip of over 7000 miles with my wife.  We drove as much as 700 miles in one day.  The Pontiac Van performed flawlessly and with a high degree of comfort.  We have cloth seats in our van and we never became tired of sitting.  The dark tinted glass was worth its weight in gold when traveling throughout the Southern States.  We purchased a Pontiac after owning a Mercury (Nissan Quest) for a few years because the Pontiac seems much more stable and sure footed on the highway.  The engine provides as much power as we needed and more.  Traveling at an average of 70 mph, with the A/C on, we got about 26.5 mpg.  We were relatively loaded with suitcases, coolers, gifts, etc. We also found that the Pontiac (GM) dealer has been far more congenial and easy to deal with than Ford Motor Company ever was.  With over 24000 total miles, the van is still very tight and quiet.  The only flaw to date has been a faulty engine coolant light which the dealer replaced with a smile. <br><br>
