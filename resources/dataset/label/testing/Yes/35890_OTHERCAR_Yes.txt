            I bought my Red Hyundai Tiburon in April of '98. So far I have over 60,000 miles on it. I bought it because it is the cheapest sports car that I can afford. I call my car "The poor man's Porche" 
It cost me 13,500 new about two years ago. I wanted this car because it doesn't have a back seat - I don't want to schlep around people or things. At the time I had laundry and a dog and both fit fine in the back seat.

Here is what I love about this car:
I get a lot of looks from people under 25 who check it out. Remember - I bought a Poppy Red car. It looks terrific after a car wash. Very flashy with out the big bucks. At the time it was either this car or the VW Beetle when they were first coming out.

I love the fact that I have racked 
1. 60,000 miles with no mechanical difficulties
2. Knobs are nicely designed, especially the Heat, Air Conditioning.. Etc.

What I don't like about the car:
1. There is no bell or alarm telling you that your lights are on. After going to work all day to find out that you left the lights on, and need a jump from a coworker.
2. You feel every bump in the road. When I first bought it, I needed one of the struts to be replaced.
3. The car "rattles" when driven.
4. Scary when driving in snow.

When I drive my car, it veers slightly to the left side. After calling the dealership and rotating tires, and alignments later, I have learned to deal with it.

Interesting enough, I would recommend this car. It gets good gas mileage, and looks great after a nice car wash. I would recommend it to single people - I use it for commuting to and from work.

The most difficulty I have is getting into and out of the car. You have to do a special slide in and wiggle. This does not work well with pleasantly plump people who have difficulty getting in and out of small cars.

Getting auto glass may be difficult because the car is pretty new. Also, your local tire dealer won't have the tires in stock, so plan ahead.  Overall a cool set of wheels for the Hyundai Flymobile.

<b> Update </b> After 90K the car is still going strong. The car needed recently new break pads, rotors. The fog light bulbs burn out quickly and need to replaced. It is hard for some passengers to get in/out of. 
<b> Update 12/19/2002 </b> I have over 106,000 miles in the car. This winter I gave the car two new front tires. This car has been very dependable. For the past year or so I have kept the car in a garage. The coin box lid between the two front passenger seats has broke off, a minor issue.
I have gotten into a car accident (not my fault) but the outside of the car is a little less shiny and has some dents in it. I have a family now, and my mother in law who is in her 60's and a bit overweight has problems getting the seatbelt around her. The seats are a bit uncomfortable for long drives. 
Overall, I am very pleased about the performance of the car. I expected the car to last to 100K Miles but I am over that. No major repairs. My parents have the Sonata and my sister the Excel and all three cars doing well.
I am considering when its time to buy the Sonata for my next car purchase - four door. There is nothing but reliability for this car.
The only thing is that I have to check when leaving the car that my front headlights are off or else you will be stuck with a dead battery, there is no warning bell. Keep jumper cables in the trunk just in case.

*New* 120,000 Miles on car as of 7/2003 - Here's some stuff
The radio is not tuning stations... The brakes were replaced... The shocks were replaced... The car rattles, comes from the trunk or rear of car... The fog lights do not turn on, Otherwise... works fine.. drove it over 190 miles today..
