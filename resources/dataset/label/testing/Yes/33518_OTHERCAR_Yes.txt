            My latest birthday present to myself was a second car.   I have friends who own and swear by their Maxima's so I decided to check out the 2003.

Maxi is one month old and ............

POWER is the only word I can use to describe this car.  I love large car and while this is not the largest on the market. I find its roominess to be more that adequate.  This baby is stylish and purrs like a kitten. The only thing I hear are the sound of Joe Sample coming from the speakers. I love the automatic transmission. The gear shift makes acceleration for passing on the highway easy.  This feature is a plus especially on the NJ Turnpike. Exits 1 through 4. 

The handling for me is perfect. Not to mention it is great on gas.  I drove from Baltimore, MD to Manhattan, NY on less than half a tank. That drive is 235 miles.  Honestly, I get the same mileage per gallon on my Explorer Sport Trac truck. So I am not sure if it is the car or the fuel. 

I have a GLE and every thing works to full potential.  I have no complaints.  So I would have to say my friends were right.   Don't get me wrong.  Maxi is  good looking car that hugs the road and out performs most cars in its class.
