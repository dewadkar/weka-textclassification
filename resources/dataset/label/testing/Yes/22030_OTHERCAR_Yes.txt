            The Nissan Maxima has been a reliable car forever, but it has become a leading vehicle in performance, reliability, and price over the last 8 years.

Since all models since 1993 have been very reliable, choosing a Maxima can be a decision made based on personal preference of styles and amenities.  

From 1993-1994, the Maxima's Body Style was made to be very sporty, yet it spans a range from very classy, to very economically oriented.  Over these years, the two models were the SE and the GXE.  In the luxury Sports Edition (SE), nearly all features can be enjoyed for a great price.  In an affordable car, one can enjoy ABS, a sunroof, a spoiler, defogging side mirrors, BOSE stereo, and much more.  If you like the sporty sedan, but prefer less luxury, the GXE is a very smart choice as well.

I have a 1994 SE, which I find ideal for my purposes. It offers the rare combination of luxury (leather, CD) with sportiness (Manual transmission, white-contrast gauges, ABS).  The car is very reliable.

I have only had some small problems with my Maxima, including a leak in Power-steering fluid. Other than that, it has been regular maintenance.  The car also has tight, sporty suspensions, which are great for most roads, but not so ideal when there are a lot of potholes.  If you do not wish to have such tight suspensions, I recommend the less sporty GXE.<br><br>
