            What an exceptional camera.  To tell the truth I was not sure about the more expensive digital cameras until I tried the Sony.  Boy am I glad I did..  If you are getting a camera for an online auction only than this may be over kill for you.  The zoom is great not to mention all of the other features.  I have spent unending hours expermenting with this camera.  Now i am not sure if I will ever have to take my 35 mm camera with me anymore.  I love the fact that you can store images on a disk and not have to hook the camera to a computer to download.  also you have several features that may never be used like the imaging such as solarization or sepia tone for your pictures , but it is there in any case.  I would recommend this camera to any one interested i a digital camera.<br><br>
