            I absolutely love our 1997 Expedition. We have 2 children and they feel like they have their own little room in the back seat. We pack a tub of toys or books and it sets comfortably between them without getting in the way or knocked off the seat. We can put the television back there with the power point in the back and they put their movie in and are good to go. With the headphone jack they can listen to Bob and Larry sing the Hairbrush song for the 1000th time, and I keep my sanity. The dual controls on the a/c and heater are wonderful for when they are tired of their bulky coats, but I am still shivering. For those long trips, the reclining seats are a lifesaver for those &quot;noodle-necks&quot; that kids seem to get when they are sleeping. And the overhead lights in back are great for reading, coloring, or finding that elusive m&amp;m.

The fold down seats are perfect for when you have to haul oversized items. We toss the bikes in and we are off to the park. We made a 5 hour trip with clothes and paraphenalia for the 4 of us, along with two bikes and still had room to spare. To me that meant one thing........room for shopping!!!

The great variety of seat adjustments on the drivers side are a good thing when one driver is 6 foot, and the other is 5 foot 4 inches. I feel like I'm on top of the world. I can see in any direction and feel completely safe with the extra height that the four wheel drive gives. It rides as smooth as any car, but has the toughness of any truck.

After looking at Explorers, Durangos, and Blazers, to us, the Expedition fit our needs and wants better for the money we were spending. For a family, the Expedition just has it all covered.<br><br>
