            When Toyota introduced the mid-size Highlander and full-size Sequoia for 2001, some questioned Toyota's decision to offer five models of sport utility vehicles in its lineup. Speculation ensued -- would the Highlander replace the 4Runner, or merely complement it? Would buyers get confused?

I asked myself those questions when I began my search for a new car. Back in August, I posted my review of the Toyota Highlander. In that review, I mentioned that I also considered the 4Runner. This review will stray a bit from being just an overview of the 4Runner; rather it will compare and contrast the 4Runner and Highlander as I saw it. As always, your mileage may vary, depending on your needs and perceptions.

OUTSIDE
The 4Runner is much more aggressive looking than the Highlander, especially with the 16-inch tires and wheels. The standard 15-inch wheels are too tiny, in my opinion. I prefer the chrome wheel moldings instead of the fender flares, unless they are color-keyed like those on the Sport package. The running boards nicely complement the 4Runner�s high-off-the-ground appearance.

The Highlander, on the other hand, looks more like a tall station wagon, like the Subaru Forester. I�ve seen Highlanders with third-party fender flares and running boards, but they didn�t match the Highlander�s more utilitarian appearance.  Don�t get me wrong though; I really like the way the Highlander looks, just in a different way from the 4Runner. 

INSIDE
This is where the 4Runner fell short in my search for a new car. It wasn�t the quality of the materials or the fit-and-finish. In those areas it was a typical Toyota. 

Rather, it was the ancient design cues. Granted, the interior dates back to the last total redesign in 1996 in which it borrowed heavily from the Toyota pick-up truck. Still, for an almost $30K vehicle, the 80s-style door panels, corduroy-like upholstery, and exposed screws in the console were less than satisfying in such an expensive vehicle.

The Highlander has an obvious advantage in this area. Not only is it a new design, but it derives many of its interior styling cues from its sibling, the Lexus RX300. The shapes and textures are superior to the 4Runner.

The availability of a power seat was also important to me. On the 4Runner, a power seat was only available on the Limited model. The Highlander had the power seat available on the non-limited model as either a stand-alone option or as a part of a package.

DRIVING
The 4Runner has a great sounding V6 engine. It sounds much bigger than it actually is. Most of the torque is delivered at the low-end, making acceleration brisk.

The Highlander V6 has more horsepower and slightly more torque, but it does so in a more subdued manner than the 4Runner. Incidentally, it's the same engine that is found in the Lexus RX300.

VALUE
For me, the value quotient sealed the deal in favor of the Highlander. Similarly equipped � the 4Runner with SR5 trim and an option package and the Highlander V6 with the Appearance, Convenience, and Preferred packages � the Highlander was cheaper. Insurance for the Highlander was also less than the 4Runner.

It�s important to note: many dealers are offering incentives on the 4Runner, which may make it cheaper than a Highlander after rebate. However, in my area, the distributor was "not participating" in the factory incentives. Dealers were more willing to negotiate on the 4Runner than Highlander, though.
