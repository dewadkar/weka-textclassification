            I love my ford escort wagon.  It is a 1993, we bought it when it was only 1 year old and only had 22,000 miles on it.  It now has 160,000 miles on it.  This car has never left me stranded or even had any any major problems.  It is a great little car, with quite a bit of cargo space for it's group or class.  It gets wonderful gas mileage and is a nice looking little blue car.  We have taken it on many road trips and never regreted taking it.

i would highly recommend this car to my friends and family, for the price and dependability, you just can't beat it.<br><br>
