            I bought this fine automobile for $3500 from a local dealer with 174,000 miles on it and I know it will last another 300,00 miles.  The best thing about the car is...everything!!!.  I love the diesel power plant and the great gas mileage it gets, especially the sound of the diesel rumbling under your feet as you cruise down the road effortlessly.  The car is a great car on the road mainly due to the fine engineering and craftsmanship involved in building the car and the weight of the vehicle.  The diesel is not a peppy as newer gas engines but it's a diesel so you shouldn't expect neck snapping acceleration and being able to shoot out in front of traffic from a red light.  I don't think I will ever buy a car besides a Mercedes Benz 300D turbo diesel.<br><br>
