                 *NOTE: I have targeted this review more towards someone interested in purchasing a Stanza, rather than anyone who currently owns one.  I also try not to go into the simple specs anyone can pull up at Autotrader.com.  Also realize that I am somewhat mechanically sound, and any refrences to prices / work, etc. are only parts, I did any work mentioned.

     The 1992 Nissan Stanza is the last production year of Nissan's mid-size car carrying the "Stanza" name.  The car was redesigned in 1993, and renamed to the Altima, although for the 93' model year it carried the name Altima-Stanza, later to be dropped to simply the now Altima in 94'.  In other words, the Stanza is an old Altima.

     Although now the Altima, this car, for all intents and purposes, is a four cylinder Maxima of the same year range.  (The 90' - 92' Stanza is equivalent to an 89' - 93' Maxima)  Each car shared relatively the same features, and a Stanza interior is virtually indistinguishable from a Maxima interior - the exterior as well, save that the Stanza gives up a few inches in size to the full-size Maxima.  Stanzas also give up a few ponies to the Maxima.  With a KA24E inline 4-cylinder engine, they produce 138 hp (all models), verses a Maxima's approx. 160 hp RG V6 series engine (in the SE models). 
 
     The reason why this car provides "The most Bang for your Buck" is that it is grossly undervalued.  Due mostly to the fact that the Stanza lineage is no longer produced.  Many consumers are unaware of this car or its name.  A one-year younger (1993) Altima could sell for double a Stanza.  Even cars of the same year range, and class (Accords, Camrys, Galants, Civics) sell for more, and provide little if no advantages, save the name that they carry.

     This car has even more value in that it performs very similar to the sporty Nissan 240sx production between 1990-92.  This is because they are the same car.  Visually no, but under the hood they house the same exact power plant, the only difference is that a 240sx's engine is rotated 90 degrees to make the car rear wheel driven (Stanza's are Front Wheel Cars) and have an additional 2hp.  Making many 240sx parts compatible with a Stanza.  Many non-engine Maxima parts are compatible as well.

      Nissan's philosophy in the early 90's was "interchangeable parts".  Anyone interested in making quite the sleeper out of a Stanza, will note that not only are many parts interchangeable from other Nissan Cars, but entire engines themselves are.  Nissan bluebird engines (Twin Turbo v6s), Turbo'd SER engines, and Silvia engines are just a few of the many applicants I have heard of with minor fabrications being transplanted.  Even with proper modifications to the current inline v4, there are Stanzas that run under 14s quarter miles, down from a respectable 16.5s stock run.

     Enough of the general overview of Stanzas.  Time for the "Meats and Potatoes."  While owning a Stanza I was very pleased with the car.  The car has remained in my family since its original purchase in 1992, and has been regularly maintained.  (Tune-ups, oil changes, etc.)  With those minor maintenance updates, there have been ABSOLUTELY NO MAJOR MECHANICAL PROBLEMS.  Let me reiterate, this is a car with well over 100,000 miles, and nothing has gone wrong with it.  It still has its original clutch, does not leak one drop of oil, and its gas mileage is great. (21-ish/25-ish, with 89 grade.) The car's interior is WAY ahead of its time.  Even now it sports some amenities that today&#146s lower end car models could learn from.

     But don't think this car is only this way because it's been babied.  Hardly.  These cars are hard to kill, you can beat on them and they still come back for more.  A friend of mine actually TRIED to blow the engine, so he could put a new one in.  It took TWO WEEKS of red lining the car before it even had any problems.  They are VERY reliable.  I had no qualms about ever taking the car on any sort of long sustained trip.

     This car is also relatively quick.  Although it is slightly heavy (attributed to better quality and more amenities) it will out run any Civic (save possibly a hopped up VTEC), Camry (V4), and its even been know to beat a brand new 2002 Celica (Let it be known the Celica was an auto, behind the lower hp base engine - but still.)

     ***PERSONAL ADDITIONS BASED ON COMMENTS
     Thanks for the comments on this review.  Per your suggestions I will discuss other features.  Handling, comfort, braking, etc.

     Handling is not one of this car's major advantages.  I believe it only has 100lb. springs, and with its ride height and body weight, it does make for some body roll in tight turns, so don't expect to turn on a dime, or have sports car like performance - its only a Stanza :)  The solution for this is obviously tighter springs and/or a lower ride height.  A cheap upgrade can be had to Maxima springs from an SE model (89-93).  Or you can buy aftermarket INTRAX performance springs, which allow for lowering, and tensioning.  I have heard this makes a vast improvement, but I do not have personal experience.

     Although handling is adequate, I must say the car has excellent grip.  I have found it very hard to make the car skid in tight turning.  (I have tried - but it does feel like the body's gonna roll off.)

     The model I own is an XE with a combination of Front Disc, and Rear Drum brakes.  GXE models come with ABS, and again their parts are interchangable.  When I first owned the car, its braking left much to be desired.  It felt like I had to begin braking very far away, and they did have some tendancy to lock up under pressure.  I solved this very quickly by putting meatier "performance" pads all around the car.  (A total cost of 100 bucks, 25 dollars per wheel). And by bleeding the brake line, and refilling it.  The car brakes well, although not great.  I've been told that changing the brakeline out to a steel one also makes improvements, since steel is not as malable as the existing rubber lines are under stress.

     The interior to this car is superb.  Everything is easy to reach, the seats are very comfortable, (They better be for road trips from CT to FL), the manual shifter is quick and nimble (but somewhat highier than I'd like), powereverything, etc.

     Also expect a cult like following with these cars.  Although only around for a few years, there are a few car clubs around.  Most notably TEAMNSE (www.teamnse.com).

     I suppose I should also list some other minor cons with the car.  

1. Body Styling:
     You can definitely tell this car is early 90s.  Its right when everything was *starting* to get rounded, but still is kind of boxy.

2. Parts needs to be changed:
    Aside from regular maintenance (oil, belts, plugs, filters, etc.)  The driver&#146s side power window failed $40, and an o-ring gave in the AAC assembly ($2).
