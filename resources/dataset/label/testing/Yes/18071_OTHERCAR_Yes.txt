                 What else can I say..  &quot;It's a Neon!!!!&quot;  with its smooth desien..  Neno become very popular for teens to drive.  It's got its own style, nice stero system, with 2 6x9 speakers in the back and 2 6&amp;1/2 in the front side door, 2 tweasers by the window, the sound quality is awsome.  Neon has enough room for us teens to do whatever in there.  The car is light, and quite powerful.  It's a pick for whoever just begin to drive.  I own a Neon 96, it was my frist car, still is my first and only car.  it's good and powerful enough to get me anywhere i want.  I am satisify with my Neon.  When you have a Neon.. who needs another car...  because &quot;It's a Neon!!!!&quot;<br><br>
