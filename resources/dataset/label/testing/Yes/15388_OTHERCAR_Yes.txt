            I absolutely love this camera!  I am able to see my pictures immediately after taking them.  If they look bad, I can just delete them &amp; don't have to use up unnecessary disk space for unwanted pictures.  I love never having to worry about buying film or paying to have film developed anymore.  The only thing that I don't care for is that you have to make absolutely sure that you hold the camera still, otherwise, the image comes out blurry.  It holds up to 60 pics on a diskette.  You don't have to buy special diskettes either.  Any diskette that is formatted will work.  I am also able to record up to 60 seconds of a video.  That way, I can record a message for a friend &amp; e-mail it to them!  To sum everything up, I would just have to say &quot;Totally awesome!!!!&quot;  Great investment!<br><br>
