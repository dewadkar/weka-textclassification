            My parents purchased my 1992 Subaru legacy AWD sedan for me used, 58,000 miles on it, in 1995 to take with me back to college in NY from Ca. 

It currently has 208,000 on an original engine and it is still purring (in true Subaru fashion) as it did the day I drove it off the lot.  I have probably put $3000 total into the car (and that is including the new tires I put on it a couple of years ago).  Those repairs include: new clutch, new brakes, and the typical miscellaneous repairs. 

The car handles very very well in snow and icy conditions, it easily carries 4 adult passengers, it has room for 5 but that is not recommended for long trips!!   The trunk space is considerable, although the storage for the jack takes a bit of figuring out how to take in and out (however, once you do, you will applaud the ingeniousness of it).  

The paint has begun to chip along the roofline (it is black paint there and other reviews that I have read have noted this as well), but that is the least to be expected having spent three years in Northwestern New York and being almost 10 years old.  

This car is as dependable as they come.  I have not had a single negative experience.  And at as many miles as I have on it you can't say that about many cars...Subaru lives up to its name in this car.  

My fiance's father is a foreign auto mechanic, and he recommends Subaru (along with Toyota and Honda) for its safety, reliability, and ease to repair.
