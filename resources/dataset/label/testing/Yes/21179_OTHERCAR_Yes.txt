            I purchased my 1996 Chevy Truck because of the dependability and toughness.  I test drove the Ford and Dodge, but I was not impressed.  The ride in both of those trucks is still from the day when a trucks ride was choppy and rough.  Once I got into my truck, I could immediately tell a difference.  The seats in the chevy are much more plush and comfortable than that of the ford or the dodge.  Not to mention more supportive.  I take a lot of road trips in my truck and can honestly say its like driving in a car.  I would recommend anyone looking to purchase a tough and powerful full size truck to go ahead and get one of these.  Even someone looking for that car like feeling, but with that truck like presence.<br><br>
