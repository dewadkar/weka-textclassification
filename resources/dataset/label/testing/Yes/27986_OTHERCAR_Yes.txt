   In a world currently dominated by sport-utility vehicles, the station wagon market seems almost negligible.  However, there's a whole new breed of European wagons that's making a significant impact on the American auto market.  Audi, Saab, Volvo, Mercedes, and BMW have all produced luxury wagons based on luxury sedans.  Honestly, all 5 station wagons are excellent cars overall; however, I feel as though the Audi A6 Avant Quattro (equipped with a 2.8L V6 engine) is the best of the bunch, in terms of comfort, little amenities, and overall value.  Granted, $40,000 for a car is not a small sum of money, but in comparison with the similarly equipped BMW (which is rear-wheel drive by the way)and the Mercedes, the Audi clearly proves to give one more for his or her dollar.  
    The exterior of the A6 Avant is sleek and seductive, despite the fact that the car is a station wagon at heart.  In this respect, the Audi has a huge advantage over the Volvo V70 which is essentially a box on wheels.  Although there's 73 cubic feet of cargo room (with the middle seats folded down), the car seems relatively small in size.  
Despite the deceptively compact appearance of the car, the inside of the A6 is spacious, both for the driver and passengers.  Rear leg room is especially good, as is head room and shoulder room.  The one I test drove was fully equipped with leather, heated seats, and a sunroof.   Upon sitting in the driver's seat, one will immediately notice the supremely luxurious look of the dash board, with rich wood trim and soft, plush leather everywhere.  Some of the car's more unusual features include: side view mirrors that tilt down when backing up (to facilitate seeing the curb, a device that assists one from exceeding a specified speed limit (by beeping unobtrusively), and a first-aid kit tucked away in the rear armrest. And of course, one must not forget the Quattro system which handles brilliantly in the snow.  Audi has obviously thought of everything that a driver could need or want in a car.  Some people have criticized the A6's slow pickup/acceleration; however, I find this criticism to be highly exaggerated.  The V6 engine allows for a great deal of peppiness and quick acceleration; maybe people just think that the car is a little sluggish because the ride is so incredibly smooth and refined, as compared to the Saab 9-5 Wagon which has a far more sporty and almost heavy feel on the road. I especially liked the A6 Avant's small turning radius and responsiveness when turning.  
   In terms of safety, the Audi is just as safe as any of its competitors, with plenty of airbags and firm headrests to prevent/lessen injury.  
   I would strongly encourage anyone who is considering the A6 to stop their decision-making process and just buy the vehicle.  It's a wonderful car for families with young children, or for a a family with kids in college, as is the case with me.  More importantly though, it's a perfect alternative to the gas-guzzling SUV'S which are notorious for inflicting thousands of dollars worth of damage on other cars during collisions.  And one more thing - Audi pays for all of the car's maintenance (at least my dealership did in Lynbrook, NY - I'm sure that all do).  That could save a person hundreds of dollars a year if there's any problems!  That Audi has agreed to cover all maintenance shows that the makers of this car are confident about its reliability, safety, and performance.  If you're in the market, I highly recommend that you consider/buy the Audi A6 Avant.  You won't regret it.<p>
