            My Corsica was bought as a GM 'Program Car' in Feb '92 with about 4k on the odometer.  The car does a pretty good job of combining form and function.  The 3.1L 60 degree V6 is strong and is a good stand alone power plant or base for performance add-ons.  Interior comforts are what I would call 'average' among similar sedans in the Corsica's class.  Not the highest quality, but with a minimum amount of care, will last a long time.

My car has a 3 speed auto that was replaced at about 74k miles when reverse went out and took some more of the transmission with it.  The alternator has been replaced twice, the second of which had a higher amp capability than stock... now the wipers wipe at full speed with the rear defrost on and the heater fan on full blast.

The car was repainted at about 70k miles.  Didn't have the severe peeling problems that others have reported, but you could pretty much produce a scratch by touching the old stuff.  Note that the car was always garaged, washed weekly, and usually had a coat of wax on it.  Bad paint, I say.

New alloy wheels and Toyo 800 Performance tires really helped the car's handling.  The brakes seem kind of mediocre to me (no ABS on my car,) but opinions do vary.

All of the accessories (with the exception of the turn-signal relay) have worked from day one, and the A/C continues to blow icy air without ever having to be recharged.

Well, my post has gotten pretty long, so I'll stop here, but I think I should mention that anyone looking for cheap, dependable, and comfortable transportation looks to the Corsica.<br><br>
