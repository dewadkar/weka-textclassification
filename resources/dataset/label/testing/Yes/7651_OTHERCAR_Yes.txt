            I bought this Sony to replace one that was stolen.  

The unit is quite nice in black.  The LCD screen, though small is very clear and crisp even in bright sun-light.

If you are used to Sony's adapting to the unit should be quite easy though some things have changed.  There is now an "automatic" setting where you have almost no control over the camera except for having the flash on or off or changing to multi burst (3 rapid shots), voice, e-mail (lower resolution), or exp brktg (3 Rapid shots are taken at different exposure levels).   The control dial can now be turned in all directions continually which is nice since I was always worried about breaking it.

Images are very good and appear very natural.  I prefer the image clarity to that of an Olympus with same number of pixels (sorry, don't recall the model).

The camera is quite quick in daylight with less than a second lag (slows down in twilight).  When using the flash there is a considerable delay of about 7 seconds before the next photo with flash can be taken.  Fortunately the camera is quite good in low light situations so that I rarely need the flash.  

Ergonomy is unfortunately only so-so.  The menu selection keys are right where I normally stick my right thumb when holding the camera.  As a result one has to be extremely careful not to press the macro key.  We have lost whole sequences of photos since it is easy to miss the little icon indicating the macro-function is on.

Switching between automatic mode and manual is not very intuitive and should be better indicated on the camera.  Having a 3rd mode (SCN) for low light situations doesn't really help.  If one sticks to the automatic mode, then you can more or less point and shoot straight out of the box.  Unfortunately it could be easy to forget what mode one is in if new to the unit.

The manual is ok but I generally hate to read them.  I had to read it to understand the different modes better which for me is not so good.
