            I like the Dodge Neon because of the body style. My sister and Brother have the 1998 neons but i didn't like those to much so when the new 2000 came out i said that's the car that i want. It is a safe car and good for traveling. I like the car because it looks nice when it is all raced out with the under body spoiler and the tail spoiler. I like the stereos that come with the car cause of the bass and the quality of sound.<br><br>
