            If you want a car with really and I mean really good gas mileage here you go.  This car is reliable, you can depend on this car.  My girlfriend loves it when I drive this car.  

I have a 95 del sol, I have not had a problem with anything on the car yet, the gas on it is cheaper than getting gas for the jeep.  The ride is fun, but I do have to admit if you take this car on a long trip and I mean a trip over two hours your butt or lower back might bother you.  This car also has a great amount of space for the trunk.  It has a lot of get up and go, and handles great around the corners, and the best thing about it is the top can come off, and the rear window will roll down.  

I love it.  My car has about 45,000 miles on it too, and still runs like it did new.  

So if you are an outgoing liking to drive type of person this is one car to look at, but if you are a person that just sits around and goes to work, and/or is lazy I don't recommend looking at this car.<br><br>
