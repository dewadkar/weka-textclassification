            This time, I�m going to get right to the point (or price) of the vehicle. To tell you car buyers the truth, having an unreliable 1991 Pontiac 6000 whilst looking for a more comfortable, eloquent ride in a newer family car did the trick for the Corolla. To be honest, it made the Pontiac seem not much to look at, and not so well-to-do. The Corolla�s general impression is a sort of �outstandingly normal� family car for those who want the optional extras without going overboard. Of course, I�m sure you�ve figured out the stressfulness of car shopping and the time-wasting while looking into each company�s reliability. Straight out, I believe Toyota is one of the companies that most searchers end up engulfed in between the selection of sedans. Personally, the Corolla wasn�t too flashy, (which was perfect for my likings) but still managed to turn a couple heads. 

	Getting truly into the car, it has three basic editions, which took away the confusion of diverse selection. There�s VE, (Value) which speaks for itself, and gives the buyer a great value, excluding the extras. CE (Classic) comes with the usually mandatory frills, and LE (Luxury), which basically gives you all you need to make this car worthwhile. Personally, the CD player in the Corolla I purchased impresses many thrilled passengers, yet I seem to take it for granted at times. It�s initially up to your main preferences.

	It�s exterior is quite plainly original, in the sense that it appears as if all its corners have been sanded down to a smooth curve. It resembles the Echo in a way, except it isn�t squashed or slanted upwards anywhere. Again, there isn�t much to criticize, since it is a plain vehicle, that looks like it can solely get you from one place to another. Overall, it looks like a real classic for the modern generation.

	The Corolla�s interior surprisingly has �all the right things in all the right places�. The buttons are fairly large and conveniently placed for those with clumsy and inaccurate fingers, and I like the fact that you can switch from AM, FM, and CD in one touch. Plus, it doesn�t have confusing unnecessary buttons, as in the Pontiac. As well, the cup holders and opening console (surprisingly important factors when it comes to traveling) are the perfect size for all your needs. Although, I�ve noticed the lack of legroom in the back, but it doesn�t present much of a problem.  In addition, my parents complain about the lack of space between the shift and the cup holders, which I can�t quite understand, and about the very little room for storage (i.e. purse, handbag) within the console. Although, I guess parents are always right�yet that�s what you can expect to get from a cozy Corolla.  

	To wrap up, the car holds a 4-cylinder engine, and gets enough miles to the gallon for a family vehicle. It is priced reasonably, and seats a standard five, (excluding the place for one in the trunk!) and again, is quite reliable to get around. Sure, this is all great, but for it to stand out, I suggest getting the extra gimmicks, since (looking at a general overview) there isn�t anything to criticize, aside from the fact that there aren�t any huge characteristics to compliment.
