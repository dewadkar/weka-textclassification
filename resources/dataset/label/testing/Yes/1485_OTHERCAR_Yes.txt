            I was real picky about buying a new car. I had spent well over a year thinking about going through with this investment, and it ended with the purchase of my beautiful 2001 Mercury Cougar. 

In my search, I knew I wanted at least a v-6 with a manual transmission. That alone narrowed my choices down to handful of cars. What I came down to was the Cougar or the Mitsubishi Eclipse. Both cars are beautiful to look at, but visually, the Eclipse is better. But when I got in the Eclipse at a local car show, I knew it wasn't for me. That car was uncomfortable. I was riding very low in the car, and I still had my head up to the roof.

But when I went to my local dealer to try the Cougar, I knew this was my car. My black cat was there on the lot the day I saw it and after test driving it, it had to be mine. It had the V-6, it had the 5-speed; my basics were here. 

The seats were much more comfortable than the previous year; they widened the back and base of the seat, which makes it much nicer for us taller folks. But they should make the back support in the seat standard. It makes corners quick and you feel very confident in faster turns. It easily does 100 on the turnpike (though officially I did 65) and I'm sure they're other people out there who feel that's slow, but I know when not to push my luck! Dual cassette and Cd player add another luxury. But the one thing that really surprised me was that are car of this size was a hatchback. But I'm not arguing, the space in the trunk is HUGE, and you can add more space by folding down the seat! Great for you skiers out there.

And a nicely loaded 2001 Cougar at only 18200? Beautiful since the tag was 19500. It's hard to find affordable sports cars these days with the options at a fair price.

It does have some drawbacks. I told you my car was black. How beautiful it once was. Was? Well, let me elaborate. 1. Black is hard to keep clean, bar-none. Damn those bug stains. If you decide to get black, get a nose bra for it. The bra is pretty good only when you have a black car. ITS WORTH THE MONEY FOR THE BLACK COUGAR! Anyway, second reason: I have slight "wind damage" to the nose. At the bend of the nose bumper, where it bends from vertical to hortizonal on the top, I see light "scratches" which I can only assume was caused by particles at high speeds. This is why I believe that the paint is thin. Only people with black Cougars will notice.

Boy do those speakers rock! Who needs a subwoofer for this car? But the sound has so much bass, that even during the test drive, the dealer had the head unit with the treble all the way up. This car needs tweeters Ford! Please listen to this Ford. PUT IN TWEETERS! 

If you have friends, make them fight over the roomy front seat. Stay out of any discussion about seating arrangements for the back! If you tell your tallest friends to sit in the back, when they get out they may not want a ride back. But if they fight it out, they can't blame you. Fine by me I say, saves me the time of cleaning the back window from their heads.
