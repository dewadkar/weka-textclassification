                I  bought a 1999 Grand Am and would recommend it to anyone in the who is thinking about buying one.  The one I bought has the 4 cylinder motor, which I never thought I'd ever own a 4 cylinder, but have since changed my mind.  I owned a 1993 Grand Am which I traded in on the '99, it had the V-6 which I was very pleased with.  The salesman actually offered me the option of &quot;racing&quot; my '93 against the '99 when I told him I did not want a weak little four banger.  I was very impressed in that the '99 held it's own.  The upgrades in the '99 are impressive.  Everything from the automatic transmission that, while on cruise, if it has to downshift on a hill, it will not upshift until the top of the hill, or whenever the load diminishes enough to shift back to overdrive, no more gear jumping on long hills.  The interrior is very comfortable with convienent controls that light up at night for easy use.  I'm very happy with the way the car handles while driving, and it has plenty of get up and go when merging with traffic while getting good mileage.  I get 30mpg on the highway, and around 24-25 city driving, depending how much I stick my foot in it.  Overall, a very good car for the money.<br><br>
