            I hope that's disclaimer enough for the autoheads out there to rate this epinion lower because I know literally next to nothing about cars. Although, perhaps now that I've bought the first one of my very own, and therefore have a vested interest therein, I'll start learning more about what makes cars tick. Or purr, rather; I don't want to hear my car <i>ticking</i> anytime soon.

I'm headed back down to school to finish up my last year of undergraduate school, and decided that it was high time I had a set of wheels to call my own. Enough of having to walk around campus for the first couple of years--I want to shed myself of the unspoken humiliation of not having my own car, and the negative effects which that has on one's social life! So a few weeks ago my dad and I headed over to the library to start looking at the Kelley Blue Books for a decent used car. During the course of our conversation, he suggested that, being as close to graduation as I am and fortunate enough to be finishing my undergraduate degree in the black (sans student loans, hurray), I might think about buying a newer car, say, a preowned year 2000 model. 

I hadn't thought so far in advance, and, not knowing the slightest thing about debt besides the fact that I don't want it, I kind of went into car buying with the mentality that what I have in my bank account is what I can afford: hence, a beater. But my dad successfully convinced me to buy a new car (yeah, I know, it really didn't take <i>that</i> much arm-twisting), and here I am a few weeks later with a 2000 Toyota Corolla CE in the driveway. A lot can happen in just a few short weeks!

I will say first off that the original auto search had been narrowed down to be between the Toyota Echo and a Honda Civic. I was looking for a sub-compact car, one with good gas mileage, and generally just a reliable car for a college student. I had driven both cars before, and were impressed with both their handling and overall comfort, although the headroom in the Civic was an issue (it tends to be, when you're 6'5&quot; like I am), and the general style of the Echo wasn't quite my idea of perfection. 

One day we found ourselves walking through the lot of a closed Toyota dealership (<i>that's</i> when you want to do the window shopping--when the salesmen aren't around!), and spotted a brand new Toyota Corolla, with nearly all the specs that I wanted, that fell right within my price range. I was surprised; I had just assumed that the Corolla was quite a bit more expensive than the Echo, since supposedly it's in a higher class. Pleasantly surprised, we talked to a friend of the family (who just <i>happens</i> to own a rental-car business and has gotten us good deals on barely-used cars in the past) to see what he could find for me.

The very next day he called me up and said he had a Corolla CE (the middle of the three subclasses, from what I understand) that he pulled off a truck slated to head to a dealership in Alaska, and he wanted to let me drive it for a day or so, just to see how I felt about it. (Yeah, I know. It was <i>nice</i>.) Well, I was sold on it by the time I made it home from the dealership. Sure, I could have shopped around more (which some people might consider doing, seeing as how it's many thousands of dollars which we're talking about here), but it was so close to what I was out to get, that I made myself a compromise and decided to go with it.

The options packages that came with my car were the pretty standard ones, I suppose: power windows, power doors, fold-down rear seats, rear window defroster, A/C, and the like. Really, the only things that I would have liked different were perhaps the color (<i>ideally</i> I would have chosen silver, but I came pretty close with white and a beige interior) and a CD player, which are pretty superficial. Especially since I can get an even better-than-factory, after-market CD player for a better price than I would through Toyota. And I was going to get it for less, 1) because I was buying through a friend, and 2) because it already had 12,000 miles on it, and so I'd get somewhat of a mileage discount (although it still falls into the &quot;new&quot; category, being a year 2000 and all).

So I swallowed just a little bit of my own vanity, called up my credit union, and promptly signed away what felt like my life. And now I'm in debt for what most likely will last the rest of my mortal probation, but at least until then, I'll be driving in style.

I know from word-of-mouth and from reading the Blue Books that Toyotas are comparable to Hondas in terms of both reliability and resale value (both are pretty much at the top of the class), so I felt comfortable buying one as new as I did, with the expectation that this car will last a solid several years. The factory warranty is the typical 36 mo/36,000 bumper-to-bumper coverage, which I guess to some might seem a bit short, but I'm taking that little leap of faith and trusting what &quot;they&quot; say. For now, it drives great, has quite a bit of get-up-and-go, has a roomy trunk, plenty of headroom, and, although it's not the flashiest car on the road, it's a pretty handsome little car. 

What else can I say? It's my first car, and I'm happy.
