            The Monte Carlo is tops in it's class for roominess, comfort, style and affordability.  When I was searching for a new car, the Monte Carlo was the first and only car in my price range which allowed me the cool sleek look of a sports car along with the comfort of a luxury car.  

I own the Z34 sport package and have to tell you that I have not seen a prettier car around!  Many people have complimented me on how expensive it looks.  &quot;A rich person's car!&quot; my mother likes to say.  And it feels like it, with my dark grey leather seats, CD player, and the feel of oneness with the car.  The gas mileage is about 25 mpg, combining my normal usage of highway and city driving.  And you just can't beat the looks of people when they see me get out of this car!  

It's fast and corners like a whisper!  It's very responsive to both foot and hand controls.  I'm spoiled by the controls on the steering wheel which are very convenient.

This car is perfect for single people or a couple without children.  The Monte Carlo is a two-door version of the Lumina, and the back seat seems to exist simply for looks, as I've been told by adults that it is extremely cramped and hard to get out of.  But as I have no children nor do I ever intend to need to ride back there myself, I don't really care about the back seat!  Nor should you if you purchase this car.  Also, as with most two door cars, the doors are extremely large: this is to say, you need a lot of clearance on the sides when you park.  But if these things bother you, buy a Lumina and try to imagine that you've got a Monte Carlo!<br><br>
