            I bought my Acura Integra Sedan LS from a used car dealership and found this car pretty spiffy to drive around the San Francisco bay area. I needed a Sedan so people would have an easier time to get out (rather than a coupe where people are straining their bodies to get out) and for me to put things in the back with ease. 

The ride is HORRIBLE if you are going on rocky terrain or even once in a while potholes. This is no smooth Toyota Camry ride.. the suspension is tight which enables you to make quick driving moves but the comfort level is minimal. It's great car for urbanites like myself who drive around on city streets most of the time since you need to make quick changes accurately. 

I get about 23-24 miles per gallon (I live in the city of San Francisco) and about 29-31 on highway driving. Very fuel efficient for a 2700 pound-142 horsepower automatic car. 

However there are some problems with this car other than the mechanical parts... The Inside feels cheap, the moonroof control is oddly placed, the sedan version of Integra has non-framed windows, the front and bumper part of the car is made out of strong plastic (when I took them off to do some fixups I found that all you had to do is "CLIP" the pieces back together like a toy rather than bolting pieces back together)

I heard that the older Acura Integra didn't make these cheaper moves, the newer RSX did not go the cheap way as the 3rd generation Integra did (94-01)

*****

Make sure you maintain your Japanese car even though it can be beat around more so than an American car. After 3 months of driving my Integra I neglected to check out my air filter and found it completely clogged with many particles (I found out why I was getting 20mpg!) so make sure you maintain your car every 1000-3000 miles - get the most out of your automobile.
