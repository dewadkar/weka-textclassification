            I recently purchased a 1997 Dodge Intrepid Sport and I must say, this vehicle is quite impressive. Whether you are in the market for a family sedan or are single and have moved beyond your obsession with two-seater sports cars and want something more practical...this car is for you.

The first thing that is appealing about the Intrepid is it's sophisticated yet sporty appearance. Unlike other 4 door vehicles, such as the Lumina or Park Avenue, the Intrepid is very sleek and manages to remain stylish while still being considered as a &quot;family sedan&quot;. This results in savings of hundreds of dollars a year on auto insurance.

At the time I purchased my Intrepid, I also test-drove a 1998 Nissan 240sx and a 1998 Acura Integra. Amazingly, their on-road performance was not significantly superior to the Intrepid. With a 3.5 liter V6 engine, the Intrepid provides surprising power and acceleration. It handles extremely well, even at high speeds and is whisper quiet. Have you ever driven a vehicle that suffers serious power lag from doing something as simple as turning on the Air Conditioner??? You won't have that problem with the Intrepid.

Other appealing features of the 1997 Intrepid are the Dual Air Bags and Anti-lock breaks which come as standard equipment. Both of these safety features provide you with peace of mind, especially if your teens may be driving the vehicle.

The Interior is both roomy and stylish...highlighted by a contemporary dash display and selectively placed air vents. The side air vents on the intrepid are actually in a rounded section of the driver and passenger side doors. This may seem like a small item to make note of, but it allows for adequate cooling of the car without having the AC running on full strength - a option which will save both power and gas.

The trunk is also nicely sized - providing more than enough height to get the groceries in the trunk without smashing the bread or potato chips. The spare tire is stored in a recessed area and is never in your way, yet is easily accessible in the event you need it.

The Intrepid is a high quality vehicle, perfect for nearly anyone - like I said, whether you have a family or are single and looking to graduate to a more &quot;grown-up car&quot;, the Intrepid is for you. It's sporty good looks, contemporary styling and practicality can't be beat! <br><br>
