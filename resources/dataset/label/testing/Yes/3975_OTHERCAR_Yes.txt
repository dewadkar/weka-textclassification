            In June 2000, it was time to put my Plymouth Sundance to rest. Having been very satisfied with our 1997 Saturn SL2, I really wanted to buy another Saturn. But just to be sure, we looked around at all the usual competitors. Of course, we ended up at Saturn and decided on a Saturn LS2. We were looking for a step up, and this car definitely was just that. The LS2 is truly a luxury car at a reasonable price. 

When we test drove the car, I liked how familiar it was. The model we test drove didn't have leather seats, and it looked very similar to the SL2 that we already own. However, the engine was very different. This car has a V6 engine, which is much more &quot;zippy&quot; (that's what the salesperson said) than the SL2. They say it's fun to drive and I have to agree. 

The car is full of little things that only Saturn would have thought of. There are front and rear cupholders, reading lights in the front and back on each side, 3 car seat anchors, adjustable height seat belts for children, adjustable height steering wheel and really comfy seats. There is a center console between the drivers and passenger seats that serves as an armrest but also stores CDs and tapes inside. The model we got has leather seats, a power drivers seat (it goes up and down, back and forth, and reclines.. ), heated seats (I'm looking forward to winter to try these out), CD and cassette players, a really good stereo system, power windows, locks, cruise control, antilock brakes, security system, the list goes on and on. It has everything a luxury car is supposed to have except the price.

Driving the car is an experience. It's kind of tilted at a funny angle where the back is higher than the front. I was a little worried that as a short person I would have a hard time seeing out the back window, but this wasn't the case. You are seated higher up than the SL2, but this just takes a little bit of getting used to. The engine is very powerful and fairly quiet, although not as quiet as the Toyota Camry. I have to say I'm not really a fan of driving but I really like to drive this car. It's the nicest car I've ever owned and I'm proud to drive it.

The Saturn dealership treated us like family because this was our second car with them. They didn't have a new one with the leather seats in a color we wanted anywhere in New York State, so we ended up with a demo car that had been driven by a Saturn manager for a couple of months. That was a bit disappointing, but when we got it it was shiny and new and still has the new car smell after 2 months. 

I have had absolutely no problems with it yet and am very happy with my shiny silver Saturn. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to buy an upscale car. It is just as nice as any other car in its class and costs a lot less.<br><br>
