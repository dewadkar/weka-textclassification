            In the market for miniature, credit-card sized cameras, nothing comes close to the Casio Exilim for a balance of features, size, model range, and cost.  The cheapest in the range, the Exilim EX-S1 is relatively full-featured given its size - notable inclusions are the backlit LCD screen and the flash (with red-eye reduction).  Other similar products are the Logitech Pocket Digital (and similar models based on the SMaL platform), and the Canon IXUS.  The Exilim EX-S1 offers much more for the money than the Logitech, and doesn't come close to the picture quality of the IXUS, but is about half the price and is much thinner.

The Exilim produces surprisingly high-quality prints.  Although offering a relatively poor 1.2 megapixels in EX-S1 form, the quality of photos on the best resolution (excluding pixel interpolation) of 1280x960 on the FINE setting means there is virtually no evidence of pixelation on full-size prints on quality paper (using a HP DeskJet 930C).  Interpolation of pixels is often viewed with about as much respect as digital zoom, but in the case of the little Casio it certainly isn't as bad as you might expect - the effect of the interpolation is to smooth the pixels, and it isn't obvious.  However, it is probably a waste of memory given that the Exilim comes with 12MB of standard in-built memory.  Mine runs a 128MB Sandisk Secure Digital flash memory card, expanding the storage capacity of fine, 1280x960 pictures to an indicated 163, although a quick check of the calculator suggests closer to 180.  However, the battery life of the camera is likely to restrict how far you stretch the memory card - it will last only 80 minutes of continuous recording on a full charge according to the manual.  So far I've only had the camera for three days, and as such cannot attest to the true capacity of the battery, although one day of fiddling during lectures at university brought the battery down to one bar.  One suspects the brightly lit LCD drains the battery (this is switchable, although the manual viewfinder is small and useless).  Speaking of the LCD, it should be noted that images always appear to be over-exposed on the small screen - a quick check on the computer soon reveals this not to be the case.

This camera is ridiculously easy to use.  Features are limited, which adds to the simplicity of use, and the manual provided is too short for anything except a quick reference on use.  A full manual can be downloaded from Casio's website for those wanting more detail.  I would recommend users also download the software upgrade to version 1.12R+ - mine came standard with v1.01, which has slightly fewer features.  Anyway, the menus are logical and easy to navigate except for one annoying feature - the tiny, malformed four-way joystick controller.  Even my nimble fingers have trouble getting the desired direction every time, and it can sometimes be a little nerve-wracking when it asks you to confirm deletion of all pictures in memory.  Loading pictures onto your PC is as simple as connecting the docking station to the USB port, putting the camera in the docking station, and turning the camera on.  It couldn't be simpler.  The only thing I cannot work out how to do on this camera is the manual white balance adjustment (there are several preset modes to choose from, and one entirely manual mode) - even with help from the manual, I cannot understand how this works.  I've read elsewhere that it's easy to hit the power button when aiming for the shutter release, but I haven't managed this yet.

Final quibbles include the lack of any form of case with the camera (just pop down to an optometrist and ask for a microfibre sunglass case), and the inability of the docking station to both charge the camera and retrieve images at the same time.

In summary, this camera is a great happy-snap tool for those who don't want to miss a moment - anywhere, anytime!  However, although I found the picture quality to be surprising good, I would never recommend anyone pay RRP for this camera (approx. USD$299) - this is far too much to pay!  However, I highly recommend purchasing a reduced price model!
