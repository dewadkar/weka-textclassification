            <i>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Who the hell knows?!</i>

Whatever it is, it catches your eye! Driving one of these will cause innocent bystanders and motorists to suffer from self-inflicted neck injuries as they whip their head around for more than a double-take!

D-d-d-d-do you like how it looks? Well, whether you do or not you have to admit it is unique! Chevy certainly made sure that the <b>SSR</b> would stand out in a crowd! 

Drop the hard top for a fashionable convertible ride! Let the wind sweep through your hair as you tear down the highway, leaping past turtles with the 290-hp 5.3L V8 engine! Oh yes, merging is no problem and neither is whoopin' that snivling brat in the Honda, what with the 325lbs-ft of torque!

The first 25 <b>SSR's</b> were used for promotional activities. They were the Signature Series. 

<b>Did You Know?</b> The <b>SSR</b> will be the 2003 Indy 500 Pace Car!

Expect the sporty <b>SSR</b> to start appearing on lots near you this summer in limited quantity. I'm sure this roadster-truck will make the same, if not more, kind of stir as the <b>PT Cruiser</b> did back in the day. The waiting lists were outrageous! 

<b>Availability:</b>

Availability will be very limited for quite a while. I think Chevy wants to keep the hype up about the vehicle, and honestly I don't blame them. They have a great vehicle that will sell well at a profitable price. Unlike the PT Cruiser which was in huge demand after a limited production period and then open to the public...they are taking a much smarter, and profitable, route this time. They will become available in limited quantities at local dealerships this summer, with it becoming more available early next year. I have only seen a couple around my area (Portland, Oregon/Vancouver, Washington). Chevrolet states that their production will be around 14,000-15,000 units annually.

<b>Innovative Design:</b>

Chevy has really upped the ante with the design of the Chevy SSR. The paint is electrostatically coated, instead of wax coated, to increase its durability and protection from Mother Nature. The laser cut frame is very precise and the structural integrity reduces vibration and noise while increasing safety. The frame is also molded using hydroforming which increases the strength of the material because it is molded at lower temperatures. The improved Vortec 5300 engine provides great power and acceleration, this is a truly American street machine. 

<b>More About The SSR:</b>

The only gauges and controls you readily notice are the speedometer, tachometer, fuel level and gears (PRNDL). The stereo is concealed under a flip-up panel in the center of the dash. This is very stylish and sporty, in keeping with the nature of the vehicle. The seats are leather and dissapointingly - not adjustable. It can supposedly fit three people, but I would say two at max. The transmission controls are on the steering column and two simple buttons control the actual shifting. 

<b>Driving Experience:</b>

Driving the <b>SSR</b> is similar to driving a mid-size truck such as an F-150 or F-250. But more luxurious like an Escalade. This makes it a very fun vehicle to drive. It was much more sporty than I expected. I was only able to drive it for about 5 minutes, just around the block, but it was a great 5 minutes! I didn't notice any quirks in the steering or any odd noises, but how could I since it was only around the block. I'm 6'4" and I fit decently, not the most comfortable but the seats don't adjust much. I was lucky to even get to start the vehicle because the dealership only had one. Luckily, the dealership was owned by my friends family. Acceleration is very quick and steering is very responsive, especially for how large the vehicle appears. I don't suspect many people have seen these on the road and I doubt many have even sat in one. I feel very fortunate to have done both, and driven it around the block! 

<b>Sponge's Final Say:</b>

Considering the lofty price of over $41,000 Chevy is aiming for the more affluent crowd - obviously. If I could, I would most likely buy it! Don't get it twisted, this is not some sleazy attempt to bring back the El Camino - no, no! This is built on an SUV platform. This is all luxury, performance, and...fun!
