            In a few months, I'll be wrapping up my 6th year of driving Nissan Altima GXEs (2 consecutive 3 year leases)and I really couldn't be much happier.  For the monthly price I'm paying ($249-never any money down), I truly feel that I'm getting an awful lot of luxury for the price.

During the past 6 years, I can honestly say that, beyond basic maintenance and a set of bad wipers, these cars have yet to have a single problem.  The cars have been extremely reliable which should be a testament to Nissan quality.  While I can't comment on what happens after 3 years, I'm supremely confident that at least your first 50,000 or so miles will be smooth sailing.

Overall, the car has been a joy to drive.  Smooth ride, acceptable pickup for a 4 cylinder and a very comfortable interior.  Also, after having our first child last fall, my wife and realized that the Altima has ample trunk and backseat room as well.

If you're after an elite driving machine with all of the bells and whistles, this car may be below your standards.  However, if you want a great car that consistently delivers quality at a fair price, you really can't go wrong with the Altima.

Best of luck on your decision.  <br><br>
