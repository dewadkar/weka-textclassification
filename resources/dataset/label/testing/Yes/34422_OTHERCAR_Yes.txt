            To begin with, I have a bit of a history with the Saturn corporation. I bought my first Saturn back in 1996 or so (feel free to see my other epinion on that purchase) and ever since I walked into the doors of their facility that day, I have been a loyal Saturn driver!  It might have something to do with the excellent service, the dependability of my SL1, or the value it retained that was able to put some cash in my pocket when I just sold it. Regardless of the reason, my new 2002 Saturn 3-door Coupe makes me just as happy as the first Saturn I owned.

A 3-door car, you say?  Bizarre concept, isn't it?  For those of us though who aren't quite ready to move on to that family car or have surpassed the need for one, but want the convenience of being able to access the back seat relatively easily, this is the car!  There's an extremely spacious trunk to add to the car's value and Saturn automobiles have the back seats that fold down to allow for even more hauling capability. The back seat isn't huge as far as passenger space, but it's comfortable enough for even full grown adults.  There is also a great deal of space as far as cup holders, side pockets on each door for maps and such, a CD organizer or area that can be used like one in the center, space for loose change, and another compartment for sunglasses or whatever other miscellaneous items you might like to have handy.  

On the SC1 there are not a lot of extra options, however, the options package that can be added for a great price includes cruise control and power locks and power windows.  The CD player on this sporty little car is standard! My purchase also has a power sunroof and came in a new color that Saturn just added to their Sport Coupe collection...cranberry!  It's as sporty looking as a bright red sports car might look, but seems to look a bit classier and mature than the bright red version.

The SC1 doesn't have quite the power the SC2 has, but trust me when I say it does 70 mph without the driver even realizing their cruising along at that speed.  With gasoline prices the way they have been this past year, you'll also be glad to know that the Saturn SC1 gets 30-40 miles to the gallon.  Talk about economical!  In case you're not familiar with the Saturn automobile, these vehicles are also made of a material that will not rust, therefore, even a 1994 can look like new with a wash job. If you happen to take your car you purchase from Saturn back every 3000 miles for it's oil change, they'll even give it that wash job and vacuum it out each time.  That's part of the oil change option that typically runs between $20 and $25. Most Saturn dealers now have a Quick Lube so all of this is done in under 30 minutes with no appointment at all.  Quite a deal for those of us on the run!  This all speaks to their service!

About the Saturn service I received, I can not recall if I mentioned in my last epinion or not the extra lengths these sales people went to ensure my happiness, but let me tell you that in the five plus years I have been in and out of Saturn both purchasing my two vehicles and for service visits every few months, I have had but one bad experience.  That one bad experience or should I say moment was made up for before I left the facility that same day by at least three other sales people and technicians.  They made sure that I did not leave Saturn that day unhappy with their service all because of one technician's "bad call" so to speak.  

Obviously, I could ramble on and on about the Saturn experience. This is truly a different kind of car and a different kind of company!  If you have not experienced an aspect of the Saturn corporation just yet, interest rates are low!  Now is the time!
