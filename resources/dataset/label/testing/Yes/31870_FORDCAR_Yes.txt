 I bought the Escort as a second car. When I had my son it was an ideal family car for us. It has wide back doors, which makes it easy to get a carseat in and out, and also its a very smooth ride. This is great for those babies who need a peaceful ride.

 Some of the great features that I enjoy about my Escort are:

fold down back seats
3 cup holders
the rear windows roll down all the way
light easy open doors
child locks
nice stereo system
easy to clean cloth seats
anti-lock brakes
neat design on the dash
and over all great look
very nice dependable engine!!!


With these features I have a nice looking family car that can basically do anything. I have hauled large boxes and items using the fold down seats, and with the easy to clean material, you can clean it in a jip if your kids get it dirty. I also really enjoy the child locks on the doors. With this feature you can lock the doors so they only open from the outside. Its nice knowing your child won't fall out! Along with these things the appearance and the wonderful engine make this car the best. It has never broke down on me once, never even stalled. The design on the dash is in the oval shape.  This looks really cool holding your heater, a/c, and stereo. 

So my over all opinion, is that this is a very dependable family car that you can really count on. With all the features and many more that I have not even mentioned you can't go wrong. Ohh, this car is very good priced and great on gas!!!
