            We bought our �95 Sentra used back in �97.  It had only 19,000 miles on it at the time � and now it�s closing in on 100,000 � so we�ve put nearly 80,000 miles in it in 3 years or so.  I drive the car daily on a 90 mile round trip commute (of city traffic � sometimes heavy) to explain the mileage.

PROS:

It�s a Nissan and you can drive it hard.  I�m not a speed freak, but I like to keep up with traffic and traffic tends to always push the speed limit by five or ten miles an hour (at least) these days.  While the Sentra is far from a power plant, it has just enough quickness to keep up on the highway.  It�ll cruise along nicely at 75 miles an hour if needed, but doesn�t have much left past that point.

The gas mileage is pretty good, which you�d expect in a compact car.  I typically average around 32 to 35 miles to the gallon, but most of my miles are highway driven.

Inexpensive.  It doesn�t take much gas to keep this car rolling and maintenance hasn�t been too bad (see CONS).  The purchase price � especially today�s used car price on the car � is reasonable.

What else can I say in favor of this little car?  It�s an economy car and there aren�t many frills.  The small amount of features it sports (power windows, locks) are nice, but nothing out of the ordinary.

CONS:

The alternator went out on us on vacation while we were half way across Kansas.  This was fairly recently (right at the 90,000 mile mark).  That was our costliest repair (~$400) and our biggest major defect.  I�m not sure if this is common or not in the Sentra, but it sure isn�t any fun getting stuck on I-70 in Nowhere, Kansas in the middle of the night.  Fortunately we limped back to a nearby down on the battery alone.

The �look�.  If looks are important to you, and you can afford something else, you�ll probably want to steer clear of this car.  It certainly isn�t very sporty and its rounded stubby little look bothers me more and more every day.  Then again, you get what you pay for and there are worse looking cars.

I can only get about 11 gallons of gas in the tank when it�s empty.  Guess that�s a typical tank for a compact car, but it�d be nice if it would hold 15 gallons or so.  Seems like I�m constantly rolling in to the gas station � but then again, my commute is pretty long.

SUMMARY:

Not a bad car for the budget-minded.  It�s pretty reliable, has enough get up and go to keep up with traffic, and the gas mileage is nice considering today�s prices.  The overall look of the car is sub-par, in my opinion, but I can live with it.

I�ll give this car 3 out of 5 stars.  If it wasn�t for the alternator problem, I�d give it 4.
