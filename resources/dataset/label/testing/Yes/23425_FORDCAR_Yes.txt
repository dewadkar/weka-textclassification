            It was time for my wife and I to purchase a new car, but we didn't want to go to the expense of buying a brand new one.  After looking around for quite sometime at various mid-size sedans, nothing really came out and said "Buy Me".  Most cars were either unsatisfying to drive, or were too expensive.  While having some warranty work done on our other car, the dealership lent us a used loaded Taurus as a loaner car for the day.  It didn't take long to fall in love with it.  I admit it, I had never even considered looking at a Taurus, thinking of them as the usual 4 door boring family sedan.  Probably drives like a tank and about as quick as one too.  Boy, was I wrong.  After one day in the car, our mind was made up, and we looked for one. Within days, we purchased one.

The one we purchased was a 2000 Ford Taurus SEL fully loaded with every option available including leather, sunroof, traction control, 6 pack CD player, climate control, and power everything.  This model also came with the engine I fell in love with the first time I drove it, the 24 Valve, 200 horsepower Duratech 3 Liter V6.  It has a very "refined" feel to it, it likes to rev a little higher than most domestic V6 engines do, so it may remind people of a Honda V6.  This engine puts out great power off the line, and at around 3000 rpm's it hits its power band and pulls hard to about 6000 rpm's.  The transmission shifts are crisp and smooth, which is something they have fixed on these newer Taurus' as some older ones were known to have drivetrain problems.  The ride on this car is straight as an arrow and its speed sensitive steering makes it easy to hold at highway speeds.  While it won't handle like a Porsche 911, it is certainly more rigid and stiff than what I ever imagined a Taurus would feel like.  The ride is soft enough on the highway for comfort, but still firm enough that it isn't rolling around every turn.  Its 16 inch aluminum rims add a nice look to it and its tires offer good traction and control.  The climate control is easy to use (just set the temperature and the system does the rest).  The Mach sound system is a better than average quality system, most of my friends think I have installed some aftermarket equipment.  The full compliment of power equipment makes things easy and comfortable.  One of the best things going for this car is the fact that it is a domestic vehicle that is abundant in quantity.  Those two facts create one great scenario, low resale value.  Not great if you purchase a brand new one, but if you are looking to buy one that is barely used, you won't find a better deal.  We bought ours with just over 33,000 kms (about 20,000 miles) for $16,000 CDN, where new they go for just over $32,000 CDN.  Comparably equipped Accords were selling for $26,000 CDN, so the way I look at it, we saved about $10,000 CDN.  I read many reviews posted here prior to purchasing and did a lot of online research on these cars, the powertrain and anything else I could get my hands on.  This car drives and feels like it costs twice as much.  It is almost an industry standard when it comes to safety, and by far a car you really have to drive to appreciate.  There are lower models available for those that are more cost conscious, but if you drive one with the Duratech engine, you will most likely not look back.  With so many good cars out there, especially in this category, I was amazed at how well Ford did with this car.  If it weren't for that day it was lent to me, I would never have even considered looking at a Taurus.  Some might call it fate, I call it a blessing.
