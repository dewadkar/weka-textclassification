            You have three different ways to take pix depending on your mood or what you need at the time:
Automatic everything with many preset scenarios
Manual-Partial
Manual-Full
I have one thing to say that impressed the heck out of me and my hubby&#133I snapped a pic when I was the passenger in a moving vehicle, now that vehicle was winding through back roads at 60Mph , I just pointed the camera towards the drivers side windshield and pushed the button&#133We were all AMAZED!!!  That photo was of trees and since it&#146s fall you can see all the branches and they were CLEAR AS A BELL!!!  No blur!!  It looked as though I was standing still when the pic was taken!  I then proceeded to snap pix the rest of the way home and I got a ton of great shots of nature and barns and such and never even had to slow down!!!
You really have your choice of how to get the shot! If you're busy like at a birthday party you want the camera to be automatic...But, when you're driving down a country road and come upon a wonderful and beautiful scene it brings out that artistic side...you can make all the fine tuning needed to take that real professional shot!!  The menu's are all very well laid out and very easy to use; for the first month I carried the manual with me in my purse along with the camera EVERYWHERE...I never once had to refer to the manual to figure out how to make the camera do what I wanted it to do. 
I got a GREAT shot of the full moon one night when we were at the coast and the details were incredible and the picture was so crisp and clear without any hot pixels either!!

When I purchased the camera I also bought a 256mb SD card, and I would tell everyone to do the same.  The 16mb card that it came with is completely useless!!  I&#146ve been able to get about 150 pix on that 256mb card all at the best quality setting.  I am not one to ever use any other setting than the best, since you never know when you&#146re going to get a perfect shot and want to enlarge it or just print it to display in a frame.  Even my regular &#147mom&#148 shots need to be good quality since they&#146ll probably get printed anyway.

I've probably snapped over a thousand pix in the 6 weeks that I've had the camera and I&#146ve been incredibly impressed with the battery life.  I purchased rechargeable 2100Mah batteries and I&#146ve gone FOREVER before having to change them...In fact I originally bought two sets of rechargeable and only once have I actually killed the batteries!!  I'm so paranoid of being in the right place for an awesome pic and having no juice!!  I snapped over a hundred flash photos and those batteries were still going strong!!!  One set is Sony 2100Mah and one set is Maxell 2100Mah batteries, and recently bought a third set just to have for long trips and these are Energizer; also 2100Mah.  All the research I did stated you should not get anything less than 2100 and I would say that they were right on the money!!

I could go on and on about the camera&#133If you want to contact me with any questions you may have before you make your purchase or if you just want to talk about pix that would be fine too!!  Black_n_White_42ograf3_lover@yahoo.com

I could go on and on...I do love this camera and I am very pleased with all of it&#146s photos...If you email me I can send some example shots in different situations; I also have a website that has just our family photos on it so that&#146s a great way to see more examples if you want the address just ask!!



Ok, after the above novel you probably think I would have no cons but I do have a few.

The only real con would be that anything you've read about the purple fringing in some night or darker shots is true.  I've found it to be very slight and something that is very easy to edit out with PSP8 or Photoshop Elements 2.0.  Most of the time I just see the purple fringing in the white glint in peoples eyes where you would normally see "red-eye" and when you put the pic through the "red-eye" removal program it takes it right out!! I also spend a lot of time in the digital-darkroom since I enjoy playing with the photos and most of the time I don't even see the purple until I've got the picture so blown-up that it's just pixels that I'm seeing. Then I come to purple where it doesn't belong and I have to zoom back out to see where it was since I had checked for it before I zoomed in.  Even then it's hard to see and I think I only see it then because I'm aware of it and where it is.

OK, now the regular petty stuff...hey I had to come up with some cons or it would be a fair assessment now would it!!

When I was trying to find a camera bad to put it in for protection I was shoving the camera in and out of bags; most of which were too small, I accidentally popped the lens cover off and it hit the floor in the store&#133Well that was bad&#133sort of&#133Bad news was that it broke into three pieces&#133Good news is that it was three whole pieces.  Meaning, there&#146s the cheapy lens cap, then there&#146s this slider piece, which is what you gently squeeze to put it on or off, and then the VERY SMALL spring that makes it work.  Thankfully I found a bad that I could stuff the strangely shaped camera in and left it in to protect the lens for the ride home, and my hubby came to the rescue and repaired the &#147broken&#148 cap and it works as good as new.  So the cap is cheap and I would love to find a nice rubbery on, but haven&#146t been able to locate one so far, but I haven&#146t looked very hard either!  Hey, I told you it was petty stuff!!

And the next issue is that sadly the camera is plastic, it would have been nice to see this beauty in real metal, but hey I guess you get what you pay for&#133right?  That it&#146s plastic hasn&#146t bothered me at all; at first I thought it would, but since the camera has that old SLR camera feel/shape it fits so well into your hand that you don&#146t notice that it&#146s plastic.  Talking of the shape, please don&#146t put your nose up at this odd looking camera&#133just think for a moment&#133Those small cameras are VERY hard to hold still enough for low light shots, no handle or grip on most digicams.  Then there&#146s the &#147hang-on-ability&#148 too&#133I know, what IS she talking about is what you&#146re saying right now, you just have nothing to grip with all those little stick in your shirt pocket camera&#146s and they never feel natural in your hand.  If you don&#146t believe me just go to your local store and try them out, I bet you&#146ll understand once you try them.  

I spent months researching cameras and went back and forth a couple of times and went to stores to try them out and also borrowed friends and families cameras to see what we liked and didn&#146t like in each one, and when it comes down to it we found that the extra little bit of size and heft enabled us to get the best shots!!  Even though the camera is bigger than the credit card size cameras they&#146re now making, I can still stuff it in my regular size purse; in fact I carry the camera everywhere with me so I never miss a shot!

OK, the last issue is a weird one, and one I would have called them for, but when I checked out the demo camera at the store it did the same thing&#133When you move the camera back and forth in a rocking type manner the barrel kind of clunks&#133and by that I mean just a little clunk type feel, nothing major or dramatic.  You can take your fingers and grab the barrel itself and it does wiggle a little bit, almost like it wasn&#146t shimmed properly or something.  I&#146m sure there is some reason that it probably does this, and it really is no biggie, I just didn&#146t want anyone to get one that didn&#146t already know of this and freak out thinking they got a bad or broken camera&#133If someone has a Z1 that DOESN&#146T do this please email me and I&#146ll call them to find out what&#146s up&#133It&#146s very slight movement nothing major, I just wanted to mention it, that&#146s all.
