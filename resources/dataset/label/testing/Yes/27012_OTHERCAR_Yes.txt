            I purchased the D-450 to go from snail mail to e-mail, but I wanted the best camera for the price.  I purchased the camera in early 1999 and have shot hundreds of top quality pictures. I have only had to delete several shots that I have taken due to my own error, not the camera.  The quality of picture and the software that comes with the camera will make you as good as a pro in no time.  I love to take multiple shots and then with the stitch program make a panorama.  The only thing that I wish was different of adjusted in design is the retraction of the lens.  To retract the lens you slide the cover to the left towards the side of the lens.  The cover doesn't trip a retraction switch (internal) until it is within 1/8 inch of the side of the lens.  This isn't a big deal but I'm a nit picker.
I would recommend this cmera for any person that hasn't used a camera much in there life but would like to equal the pro's out there ;o)
You will enjoy this camera as I am still doing.  <br><br>
