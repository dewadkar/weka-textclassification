            I bought this camera for office use in which numerous people would be using it. Prior to the Sony, the office had another brand that used the smart card and required a special 3.5 floppy adapter. It also required special software which had to be loaded onto the users computer in order to read the card. It was a real headache loaning out the camera because I had to first show everyone how all the pieces and software played together. And then when they would returned the camera, one of the components was often missing. Sony solves this problem by using a standard 3.5 inch floppy disk that can be read by any computer. Therefore, all the borrower needs is the camera; he or she provides the diskette and nearly everyone has software that reads standard .jpg files. I believe Sony is the only one to use floppy disks. The downside is that playback is slightly slower and storage capacity is reduced. On the other hand, floppies are inexpensive, always on hand and allows for simplified playback.
The FD-83 has some nice features which include a 3x optical zoom and a 6x digital zoom. There is also a macro (close up) mode that lets you take pictures down to a distance of one centimeter! There is a movie mode that takes video which can be played back either on the camera or directly to a TV. The LCD view finder is clear with an intuitive menu that makes operation a breeze. <br><br>
