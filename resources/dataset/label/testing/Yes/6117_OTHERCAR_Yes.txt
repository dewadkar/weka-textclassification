            I have now owned my 2000 Impala for 2 weeks and have loved every minute of it. From teenagers to elderly this car for you!  
Our Impala is the LS fully loaded but without the leather seats (I am not wild about Leather seats so I didn't want them).  We have the rear spoiler and sunroof.  
From the outside to the inside this car is luxurious.  One the inside you have side and front airbags on the drivers side and front airbags on the passenger side.  You have dual controls up front for the heat and air.  If the passenger wants warmer they have their own control. There is also two cup holders in the front.  In the rear all three seats have shoulder seatbelts. That was a selling point for me.  There is also lots of room in the back.  Even if you have adults in back there is plenty of leg room.  
The stereo system in this car is excellent as well.  It is AM/FM, Tape and CD.  The is the RDS stereo.  It also called the &quot;smart stereo&quot;.  If you have it on and then get on the freeway is will adjust the volume to the freeway noise.  Once you slow down again it will turn itself back down.  Also it has the controls for this on the steering wheel so that you don't have fumble with the stereo.  
This also a very affordable car.  It gets pretty good gas mileage.  20 in town and 29 on the freeway.  
As I said before this is a car for everyone. We looked about 3 months for a vehicle.  I am so glad we picked this one. <br><br>
