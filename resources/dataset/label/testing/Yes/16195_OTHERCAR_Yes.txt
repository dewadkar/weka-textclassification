            We bought our '99 Sienna LE in January of '99 (last day of the month, during a light snow storm - worked well for our haggling!)

I was always the type of person who thought minivans were ugly and frumpy.  My opinion changed once I started noticing a few Siennas on the road.  I researched them, test drove one, and fell in love with it!  The safety record is great, so I am at ease driving around with my kids in the back.  

Storage is good, but if all six seats are in, don't expect to pack a week's worth of luggage for a family of four in back.  

My best friend bought a Dodge Caravan the same week as I bought my Sienna, and I must say, I think she's jealous!  Her Caravan seems so &quot;bare bones&quot; inside.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone, even those of you who swear &quot;I'll never buy a minivan&quot;  You don't know what you'll be missing!<br><br>
