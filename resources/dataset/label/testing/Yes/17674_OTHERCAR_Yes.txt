            I always thought Saturn owners were crazy. If you got them talking about their cars, they would seem to stare off into space and go on and on about their Saturns. I, typically, thought, &quot;Shut up, man. It's just a car.&quot; The loyalty of those drivers when it came to their Saturns, though, stuck with me through the years, and I decided I'd take a look at one when my wife decided she needed a new car.

So, off to the local Saturn dealer we went. We told the salesman that we wanted a forest green one, and he picked out a 2000 SL-1 for us to inspect. While pointing out the impressive safety features and solid construction of the car, he said, &quot;Look here,&quot; and then took his knee and drove it into the side of the car. The poor door panel suffering under the weight of the 220-pound salesman kind of buckled, and then snapped back in place after the offending knee was withdrawn. We were impressed, and are still impressed when we park my Wife's car next to mine and compare door dings -- she has none, while I have plenty.

The salesman tossed us the keys to the Saturn, and off we went. Now, the engine is what you'd expect from a four-cylinder -- modest pickup and great fuel economy. The engine is nothing to write home about, but it does perform well on the highway when you get it up to speed, and the ride is pretty quiet, smooth and comfortable. While the car isn't exactly a buzzbomb, it cruises easily and confidently down the interstate, and averages around 35 MPG with mixed driving. That's not bad at all when you consider that fuel prices are going through the roof. I'll sacrifice some performance any day for that.

As for safety, I've looked at some crash tests on the Saturn and the car holds up well. That is very comforting when I consider that my three-year-old son is often riding in the back of that car. If it's not safe, I don't want The Boy in it.

The car is rather small, but quite roomy inside. We can fit four adults in the thing easily, although five adults is a stretch. The backseat area is quite roomy for a compact. Also nice are the over-sized guages, roomy trunk and backseats that fold down for easy trunk access.

As for my Saturn dealership, I hope that ones across the nation are that good. Those people were very courteous, and didn't use any of that &quot;high pressure&quot; junk on us. I can honestly say I've never had a car deal go down that smoothly, and I never felt like they were trying to corner me into buying something I didn't want. The salesman's attitude was laid back, and we quickly got the idea that he'd love it if we bought the car, but would continue living if we decided not to close the deal. That's unique, to say the least.

Saturn is also very good at customer relations. The folks at the local dealership went nuts when we bought the car, what with the &quot;Saturn chant,&quot; clapping, introductions, hollering and all. And, whenever we bring the car in for service, they're very prompt and keep us informed of everything that's happening to our car. And, even when we get something as simple as an oil change, we get a nice thank-you note in the mail. The Saturn newsletter we receive is kind of fun, too. If Saturn's goal is to get plenty of repeat business, they've done well with us.

In short, our Saturn has proven to be very reliable, comfortable on long trips, safe, quiet in that rattles and such haven't crept in yet, and easy on that fuel. The only downside I can see is that the engine isn't as strong as I'd like, but it is reliable and quiet. Our Saturn, too, was dirt cheap at $14,500, and we got a heck of a lot more car than we thought we would. Little details, such as a filtration system that helps eliminate pollen and such, are evidence of a well-designed vehicle. I'd recommend this thing to just about anyone and, thus, have become one of those crazed Saturn owners who have purchased an enjoyable little car.

<b>Update!</b>

I hate the alarm system on this car. Like most vehicles these days, this comes with a keyless entry system that activates the alarm, unlocks the doors and opens the trunk.

The problem with that little unit is that the buttons are durn sensitive. If I bump a button by mistake, I'm liable to open the trunk, set off the alarm or lock/unlock the doors. That's not a good feature, particularly if you set that alarm off by accident at 2 a.m. by making the mistake of touching the keyless entry thingie that's in your pocket.

Seriously, folks, I've been going through my pocket to find loose change, and the alarm has gone off because I hit the appropriate button by mistake. I have a Ford Escort ZX2 with a similar keyless entry system, and I've never had that problem -- you have to hit those buttons pretty hard and intentionally to use it.

I'm not sure if one can get a Saturn without the keyless entry system, but I'm sure as hell going to try the next time I buy a Saturn. Truly, that's an annoying feature of the car.<br><br>
