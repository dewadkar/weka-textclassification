            After my 1988 Accord was stolen, I decided to buy a 1990 ES 250.  The car was 5 years old at the time, with 54,000 miles on it.  I bought it because of its smooth ride, nice features, and the Lexus/Toyota reputation for reliability (more on that below).  Not many people know about the ES 250, which makes it a sleeper in the used car market.

Toyota introduced the ES 250 in 1990 as an interim entry point for its new Lexus division while it was preparing to release an entirely new model (to be called the ES 300) in 1992.  The ES 250 is essentially a moderately upgraded Camry V-6, with the most significant differences in the interior.  The Lexus has a beautiful Bird's Eye Maple center console, upgraded upholstery (fake &quot;leather&quot; is available), and a generally more streamlined look to the dash.  The ride is a bit quieter, but otherwise, it drives much like the Camry V-6.  A manual transmission was available, although it is rare.  Other features include a power moonroof (without a tilt feature), a very good six-speaker stereo with optional CD player, power driver's seat (without adjustable lumbar support), split fold-down rear seats, anti-lock brakes, and a built-in alarm with ignition kill.  The ES 250 also comes with a two-tone paint scheme and slightly cleaner exterior lines than the Camry.

The ES 250 is quite pleasant to drive.  The engine provides steady power, although it really wakes up when you rev it past 3500 rpm.  The ride is smooth and generally quiet, although the frameless windows allow more wind noise than I'd prefer.  In sum, the ES 250 is a great highway car.  It seems to eat up long stretches of highway with very little effort.  Handling also is fairly good, and it can be improved considerably with the right tires.  My previous tires were Michelin Roadhandler GT+s, and they give the car an almost tenacious cornering grip.  My new MXV4s give it better traction in the snow, but they sacrifice quite a bit of dry grip.  In short, I don't think that there is a car of this size (it's quite small - more on that below) that can match the smooth, quiet, and refined ride that the ES 250 delivers.

The fact that the ES 250 was not a high-selling model gives it another plus - it does not get stolen frequently at all.  Unlike comparable cars such as the Camry and Accord, which are frequent targets for thiefs, there aren't enough ES 250s out there to create a significant demand for stolen parts.  But despite this relative obscurity, the ES 250s seem to hold their resale value well.

Although I generally have enjoyed my ownership experience with the ES 250, there have been some disappointments.  First, the build quality is not what I would have hoped for.  Lexus/Toyota used a lot of plastic clips to fasten interior pieces in these models, and these clips have not held up well over time.  The (fake) leather interiors also don't withstand the test of time; the upholstered seats actually have a better quality fabric that wears much better.  Another interior gripe is the back seat, which is very well contoured but lacking in leg room if the front seats are pushed back all the way.  If you want to put 6-footers in back, front seat passengers have to be willing to give up some of their leg room.

My ES 250 also has required more maintenance than I would have liked.  The power steering hoses went bad within weeks of when I bought the car, and replacing them set me back by about $600 (and that was less than it would have cost had I not known the mechanic).  A year later, the radiator cap cracked (it, too, was made of plastic), although fortunately it was covered under my extended warranty.  To its credit, the car has not left me stranded anywhere, but repairs are costly when necessary.  And my 1988 Honda Accord held up better, so I would have expected more from Toyota's upscale division.

My final disappointment is fuel economy.  I simply can't understand why a light car with a relatively small V-6 can't get more than 18 mpg in the city and 25 mpg on the highway.  Many of the V-6s in newer mid-size sedans deliver considerably more power in much heavier cars, and they provide better fuel economy.

Despite my disappointments, the ES 250 is a good car and a good value (believe it or not) in the used car market.  For the same price (maybe cheaper) than an Accord or Camry of the same year, you get a quieter rider, V-6 engine (not available on 90-91 Accords), more upscale interior, and the benefits of first-rate service at Lexus dealerships (including free loaners at most dealerships when you schedule service).  If you are looking for a very refined car at an attractive price, it's hard to beat the ES 250.

If you are planning on buying one, try to find a good Toyota mechanic.  Many of the ES 250's parts are the same as the Camry's, and they run 20%-30% cheaper if you by them from the Toyota catalog than if you buy them from the Lexus catalog.  A good Toyota mechanic will find out whether the parts you need can be ordered from Toyota, and this can save you quite a bit of money.<br><br>
