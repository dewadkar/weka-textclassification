            The main thing I love about this digital camera is its wonderful performance while still keeping its small size.  Its max resolution is 2048 x 1536, but has a �measly� optical zoom of 2x.

The long battery life is sustained by a (propriety) rechargeable lithium ion battery, which is the perfect balance between size and capacity.  It�s 16MB Type I CF card is small to say the least, yet this can be upgraded quite easily.  One is able to store hundreds of photos with a relatively large CF card or Microdrive.

It is somewhat easy to use, yet always produces wonderful quality images.  This is generally a wonderful camera for people who want a compact size while still being able to have advanced features.

Canon, as always, has made another piece of reliable photo equipment.
