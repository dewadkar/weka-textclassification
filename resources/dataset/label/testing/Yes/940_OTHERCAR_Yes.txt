            The Sienna was selected over our other consideration, an Oddessy, because of availability and what we considered better styling.  Interior size was less important than handling and smooth ride.  Purchased seven weeks ago, we are not disappointed with anything except for the Firestone Affinity tires, which, while providing that smooth ride and good handling, seem to transmit the shock from small bumps.  We believe the next set of tires, undoubtedly Michelins, will cure the problem.  The transmission is incredibly smooth, and shifting, especially from park to reverse, is hardly noticeable.  Gas mileage has been within the range claimed on the sticker; 19 mpg city, 24 mpg highway.  This minivan is loaded, but without the side airbags, traction control and self dimming mirror with compass.  We are pleased with the six CD/tape/AM/FM sound system, moon roof, power driver's seat, leather upholstery.  The climate control system works great.  We like the keyless remote that operates both power doors and are pleased with the security system.
We have found only two less-than-perfect things on the minivan.  Folding the rear seats is easy, but in order to flip them up and out of the way, the head rests must be removed; an inconvenience.  A bit more worrisome is that there is a button to operate each of the power sliding doors on the pillar between the front door and the sliding door that a young child could easily push.  While there is a switch on the dash to disable the power sliding doors, it takes considerably more effort to manually open these doors without power than non-powered doors.  It would have been much wiser for Toyota to just have a switch to disable those interior power door buttons, than requiring that the power to the doors be turned off.  We may have to figure out a way to make those switches child-proof.
(Update Dec 9, 2003) More than two years later and 30,000 miles on the Sienna, and not a problem worth mentioning.  Oh, there is a minor squeak in the brakes if I push the pedal lightly, but it disappears with harder braking.  Recently, I pinched one of those Firestone Affinitys, which I have grown to despise, against a curb and punctured a hole in it.  So as planned, I had all four replaced with a set of Michelin Harmony tires.  What an improvement!  Smoother riding, not as harsh on the bumps, and a definite better grip on wet pavement.  I see that the '04 Siennas are larger.  I like the size and style of my '02 Sienna better.
