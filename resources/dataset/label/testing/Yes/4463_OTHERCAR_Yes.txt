            I'm not by any means the authority on this car simply because I have not personally been the one to buy it.  This however, does not diminish my opinion.  Basically, this car is awesome...It has the look of the oh-so-cute beetle, but not the awkwardness of it (sorry :) At the same time, it is sleek looking and classy.  It is perfect for people, especially students, who are looking to buy a car for the first time.  This is because it's Volkswagon so you know it's safe, it's a convertible so it's just cool, and it's really cute so you don't get the snotty sports car stares...it's just an all around good investment and something I would be honored to drive.  <br><br>
