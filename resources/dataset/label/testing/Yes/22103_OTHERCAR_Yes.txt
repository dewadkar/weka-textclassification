            I like instant gratification.  I wanted a digital camera in the $300-$400 range, and found myself choosing between the Kodak DD215 or the Olympus D-360L.  Based on what I read, both received high praise, however, the most common complaint about the Olympus was the lack of an optical zoom feature.  As I was accustomed to using a 35mm camera with a zoom lens, I chose the Kodak.  As an American, I hate reading instructions. I was taking pictures within 5 minutes of opening the box; it's that easy to use.   The camera is extremely user-friendly. Once I got over the novelty, I read through the instructions, and found all the settings easy to sort out.   The camera has help built in, which is very handy.  The output is much better than I expected, particularly for email, screen savers, etc.  Prints will be as good as your printer can manage.  I spent about $500 for the camera and a new printer, and, using the highest resolution on the camera, photo paper, and the highest resolution on the printer, the output is very close to that produced by a sub-$200 35mm.  Far better than I anticipated.  I also like the compactflash memory.  I picked up a 16 meg card (the camera comes with a 4 meg) and can fit 78 good quality images.

On the downside, 2X zoom isn't much.  Getting shots of wildlife is near impossible, but more zoom is significantly more expensive.  A built-in lens cover vice a removable one would be nice.  The image processing software is a bit unwieldy.  If you get one, immediately invest in a battery charger.

This camera is a good choice for anyone who wants instant gratification at a very good price.
