            This past summer the Chamber of Commerce sponsored a street festival in my town. Part of the displays and booths were downstairs near my apartment and, when I saw this, I borrowed this little Nikon from one of my neighbors to take some impromptu shots.  This camera produced excellent point and shoot results. 

The Nikon Coolpix 800 is lightweight and compact. As I said, taking pictures is easy, even for the &quot;electronically-challenged&quot; like myself.  It operates with four AA batteries and I got about 50 shots before I had to replace them.  Using rechargeable batteries would be a very good idea with this camera since you can go through that many shots before you know it.  For the more technical-minded, this camera has a four-step digital zoom (1.25x, 1.6x, 2x, 2.5x), automatic focus, metering and flash, a high resolution LCD display and  video signal output for displaying images on TV.  It also comes with an 8mb compact flash memory card.

I noticed that some of the prints had &quot;red-eyes&quot; but my friend used the editing software that came with the camera and fixed the shots.  The prints had vibrant color and very sharp images that were still sharp even after enlargement.  I was able to upload some of the pictures to my friend's computer to send to relatives.  The uploading process seemed longer than necessary, probably because of the slow serial port which came with the Nikon. I highly recommend this as a relatively inexpensive digital camera which will produce great sharp pictures time after time.
