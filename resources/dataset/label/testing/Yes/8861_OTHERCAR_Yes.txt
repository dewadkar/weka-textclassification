            some members of my family are the kind of people dead set on buying american cars. They always tell me...buy american! Well I guess I'm the blacksheep of the family cause I love Hondas! The Accord especially.

I have owned two of them now and they have both been super economical and dependable. I had a manual transmission(I prefer to have more control of the car),and I'm not sure if this is true in comparison to the automatic versions, but this car is quick! It definately has a lot of pep. The 6 cylinder engine delivers smooth powerful performance whether you are driving around town or around the country. It also helps that the interior is user friendly and comfortable.

The upkeep of the accord is surprisingly inexpensive. I have had very few repairs to make aside from routine maintenance. Real world gas milage is around 15 city up to 40 highway although honda puts the estimate lower I guess it's all in the way you drive. The only thing I would warn against(and this is a problem with hondas old and new)is that that the accord utilizes a suspension component called a control arm and its located in the rear wheel assembly. After 100,000 miles or so, the bushing wears away and the control arm lets loose causing the wheel to tip at a 45 degree angle...that was strange when it happened but the dealer said it happens to most accords at some time or another...and the fix was about $150.

Other than that I would recommend this car to anyone. It is a great car and can competer with cars in a much higher price range. Wel thanks for reading and drive carefully!<br><br>
