            For $300-$400, this camera blows EVERYTHING else away. Don't kid yourself, there just isn't ANY OTHER CAMERA you can buy in this price range that beats this baby for photo quality. I've taken about 500+ shots with mine so far, and it's a great camera for the money.

Pros:
1. It's cheap! I've seen this camera for a low as $273!
2. It's FAST! 4MB internal buffer makes this camera fast.  It looks and acts very similar to a film camera. If you take more that 4 shots very rapidly in a row, it will slow down as it writes the buffer onto the CF card, but with normal shooting, it's fast.
3. Excellent photo quality. All my shots, especially the  3.1 MP shots are awesome. Great color.  
4. Easy to use, excellent menu system, fast downloads.
5. A great lens! Best stock wide-angle lens of any digital camera.

Now that I've said that, there are just a few little things that prevent this camera from being 5 stars: 

1. This camera is VERY VERY LOUD. This is *not* a quiet camera. Every time you 1/2 press the shutter button to focus, it makes all kinds of grinding mechanical-type noises. Frankly, until I tried several other ones, I thought mine was broken! But, it's normal.  
2. Of course, there is no manual focus. And, if you don't do the firmware upgrade, it's low-light focusing ability is somewhat limited. If you get it, do the firmware upgrade right away. Also, ignore those opinions that say that the flash is weak, too. Those people expect way too much from a point-and-shoot camera. The flash works fine in normal, home-type flash situations.
3.  The 16MB CF card included is a joke.  The only reason it's in the box is so that you can make sure that you're new camera works before you trot off to the store to buy a decent one. (128MB CF cards can be found for $99 now, so buy a big one!)
4.  The battery life isn't too bad with this one. If you are careful and you use the optical viewfinder as much as possible, the battery should last all day (100+ shots). If you are going to use it a lot, or if you use the LCD a lot, get the second battery with the quick charger. That way, you can charge your batteries in 1 hour vice 4 hours, and you'll have more than enough juice to last for a day or two with two batteries. Get a car charger cord, too. 

Overall, I am very happy with this camera CONSIDERING WHAT IT COST. If I has paid near list price for this baby ($599 I believe), I would not be very happy. But, at $275-$400 this camera is absolutely fantastic.
