            I have had the pleasant experience to have a Monte Carlo for two weeks on a road trip to South Carolina from my home in Milwaukee, WI.  To say the least I was very impressed with everything the Monte Carlo had to offer.  There was a 3.8L V-6 under the hood that did not struggle at all through the Carolina mountain passes.  
When proceeding on the freeway the car had an abundance of power to get up to freeway speeds quickly.  The ability to drive over 2500 miles in this car offered me the opportunity to see how nice the car actually was.  All of the controls are manageable and they are attractive in the dash.  The seats are comfortable for a base model.  I did not experience any back pain that you can receive in a car when driving extra long distances.  
The styling may be considered quite different from other cars and may lead some people to shy away from the car.  Another possible drawback is in the limited back seat room.  The car was a little cramped with my three friends and I in it, but overall it had a decent amount of room for a two door vehicle.
I was initially hesitant at taking the car because of prior experience with the 1990's model Monte Carlos, but with the ability to drive the car I have to say that it was very pleasant.  I have driven the older style Monte Carlo's and have noticed the improvements in not only the handling, but also the overall quality feel that this car offers.  This car definitely is a great improvement from the last Monte Carlo and I feel one of the nicer two door cars on the road today.
