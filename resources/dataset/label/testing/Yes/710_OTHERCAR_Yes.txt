            My husband and I bought this camera because we had just had our first son and we wanted the ability to email pictures. We chose this one because of the great picture quality and price. This camera takes great pictures. When you enlarge them they are very, very clear. It has a lot of features that are great for taking many different types of photos. 

Their are several problems though. The camera focuses very loudly, but this is a minor thing. I have not been able to solve the problem of red eye when you use the flash. When you do not use the flash the pictures are taken in slow motion, so they usually turn out very blurry. But I understand that this is the case with all digital cameras.

I would recommend this camera to anyone taking outdoor photos. They come out beautiful. I also recommend getting rechargable batteries, as the batteries seem to die quickly.<br><br>
