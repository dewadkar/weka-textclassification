            This car was bought as the wife's car earlier this year. It has proved to be extremely reliable and is a very pleasant car to drive. 
 Ours is a 1996 Ford Mondeo Ghia (in New Zealand we don't call it a Contour) it is the equivalent of the highest end model and is assembled in Germany. There is nothing not to like about this car, it has all the extras and was fitted with a 12 stack CD player as an aftermarket option. The performance comes from a 2.0 litre Zetec 4 cylinder engine which provides peppy performance in the higher revs, however because it is difficult to get very good performance at lower speeds, the car is usually left in 'sport' mode. The engine also is a tad noisy.
We haven't had to do any repairs on this car during our ownership. It has travelled 80000kms(50000mls?) so far.
The car has incredible handling- unlike any car I have driven before, partly thanks to super grippy Michelin tyres being fitted.
Build quality is also excellent. The car's finish is to the same quality of much more expensive German cars.
If you are in the market for a small/medium car with a pinch of performance then the Contour/Mondeo is well worth a look.<br><br>
