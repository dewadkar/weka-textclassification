            This small car has finally made it into the league of gentlemen cars which  cost 10-15K more.  The handling is very good and the engine sings a powerful song.  I love trouncing the BMW and Lexus at the light.  My specs found 6.9 seconds to 60 MPH.  (It flies).  My options included the 17" wheels and sticky tires.  Twice I have stopped the car and looked at the rims to see if the were damaged after contact with potholes.  Yeah yeah, I know.  I worry too much.  All that aside I find this car to really be a drivers car and provides decent fuel economy along with real driving pleasure.  So far, even with a heavy foot, I get 22 MPG in the city.  The highway mileage has been around 28 MPG so far.

VW/ Audi never thought they could have so much fun with automatic transmissions.  The fit is perfect with the 1.8T engine and allows for me to put it in drive or choose when to shift manually.  If your stupid and redline, the car shifts itself so it won't self destruct.  The car also has ABS and anti-skid/wheel slip monitors that reduce speed and operate the abs if it thinks your going to spin out.  No other small car offers this combination as standard equipment.  Just in case you do loose control and crash you are surrounded by airbags.  Standard front and side plus side curtains front and rear.  Once again, no other compact offers this combination as standard equipment.  Remember, VW uses heavier external steel than most Euro and Japanese cars so this car has a lot of mass for its size. This also means less chance of rust through a couple of decades from now and keeps it from crunching in a crash.  The latest results were 5 stars (Best) for both front and side impact for the 2002 GTI on an identical European model.  

If you have allergies you might love this car as it has a HEPA pollen and dust filter just like Mercedes.  (An oil burner was in front of me and I could not smell a thing coming inside the cabin.)  Speaking of the cabin, it is impossible to find any flaws.  Every fit and finish is top notch.   My seats are all leather.  The steering wheel and shift knob are also leather.  I should mention that the steering wheel is both tilt and telescoping.  This is also the only compact car with that feature standard.  Now about the Monsoon stereo.   This item can be easily replaced with other (better) systems.  The Monsoon doesn't even have a loudness button!  For those of you who live in cold climates you will find the heated leather seats very handy. The mirrors are heated as well as the windshield washers to keep you free from window glaze. If you don't like leather, you can still order a cold weather package to heat the regular cloth seats and windshield washers.

The only repair so far has been on the electric windows. VW sent out a recall to replace the plastic window holding clips that break with stronger metal ones. In addition, they guaranteed the repair for seven years which was a nice touch.

GTIs are still a little hard to come by.  It seems that VW isn't making as many as they could to keep the price a little high.  That is good as it will help you retain a good resale value.
