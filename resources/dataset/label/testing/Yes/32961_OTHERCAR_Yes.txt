            <b> Black Beauty! </b> I don't exactly remember why I chose to purchase this car about three years ago, but I did. I purchased a black one, and I bought it brand new. Now, I like to name my cars, and over time I chose to name this one <b>Black Beauty</b>. I cannot say that this is the best car in the world, but it has done well for me and holds a lot of sentimental value for me. 

I don't exactly love driving, but when I am forced to drive, my main concerns are safety and reliability. This car excels in these two areas. This car has done well in crash tests, and does come equipped with front side airbags. It brakes, handles, and accelerates well to avoid any possible accidents. The steering wheel is light and easy to maneuver. The automatic gear shift is on the floor, and some people may not be used to that. I wasn't at first, but I like it. This car is very easy to drive which also helps to make this a safe car to drive.

I consider this car reliable, because I have had no mechanical problems with this car. This car has always started on the first try for me (knowing my luck it won't start tomorrow). This offers me peace of mind, because here in the midwest weather conditions change so quickly. The ride has always been smooth, and I have never heard any noises or sounds from this car. 

The 1997 Camry and most Camry models come with two engines choices V4 or V6. I chose the V-6 cyl 3.0 liter four cam engine. I suggest the V6 for the extra power. I have never driven a V4 camry, but I been told that is it lacking in power. It is nice to have some extra acceleration when trying to get away from those hungry eighteen wheelers on the highway. On the road, the gas mileage on this car is good. I get about 19-20 miles per gallon with standard driving, and about 24-25 miles per gallon on the highway.

The interior design of this car is probably my favorite part. It has a nice , light brown (also comes in gray) carpet which cleans very well. The driver and passenger seats are adjustable into many different possible positions. The interior also comes equipped with a nice center storage compartment, cups holders in front and back, vanity mirrors, and a sunglasses holder. For storage space, the back seats fold down to add space to the trunk. By the way, the trunk is nicely spaced to begin with.


<b>Time to Show Off?</b>

I only wish that there was something showy or sporty about this car, but there really isn't. A moonroof is an option on this vehicle, but I choose not to add this feature. There also is a two door option which is nice (Solara), but Solara wasn't around when I was looking for a car. I would be love to have doors that flip open from the top instead of the sides. But, who am I kidding?

No, this is only a dream with this car. Most people consider this car bland, and probably rightfully so. It appears to be missing some pizzazz. Actually that doesn't bother me because I am not looking to turn heads with this car, but I warn others who are looking for something with 'show' value. This is not a car that you can go around your neighborhood to show off. <i>&quot;Look dude, I bought a Camry&quot; </i> doesn't bring as much excitement to people as <i>&quot;Look dudette, I bought a Corvette.&quot; </i>


<b> Standard Standards </b>

I have the basic standard features on this car which all work fine. I have CFC-free air conditioning, heat, AM/FM radio with cassette player, power locks and windows. The warranty on this car is again standard. You are giving the basic 3 years or 36,000 miles warranty with this car. The warranty on the powertrain 5 years or 60,000 miles. And the warranty protecting against corrosion is 5 years ( unlimited mileage).

Some other standard features on this car are: rear view mirror remote control lever, ashtry, parking brake lever, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, front wheel drive, 4 speed automatic transmission,tilt steering wheel, rear window defogger, digital clock/tachometer, and intermittent windshield wipers.

The Toyota Camry also comes in three different models: CE, LE, XLE. The model on my car is LE.  Each car comes equipped different standard features and options. Thus if you are looking to buy a CE or XLE, you will have to check to see what features model has and what options you can get on the car (if you are buying it new).


<b>Is there any part of the design that I detest? </b>

I really don't like the supporting rod that you have to use to keep the hood open. It is a plastic rod that seems to waver if you push down on it. The rod seems cheap and flimsy. I would rather have metal or something that appears to be stronger. Also, they could have easily placed two rods on this car (one on both sides).


<b> I Love You For Sentimental Reasons</b>

Honestly, I never thought that I would drive this car for more than three years. I thought that I would trade this car in by now. However, since I have had no problems with this car, I decided not to risk buying another car. Also, I value for this car for sentimental values. I remember a lot of the exciting places I have traveled to in this car. Also, I remember all of the friends and family that I have enjoyed driving around. I have used this car to nap in, relax in, listen to music in, read in, work in.  <b> Black beauty  </b> has another longer nickname, &quot;the movable home away from home&quot;. 


<b> Parting Thoughts </b>

If you are looking for a good value car that is reliable and safe, then the Toyota Camry is the one for you. Toyoya Camrys have a reputation to last a long time with general maintenance. Driving a Camry over 200,000 miles is not uncommon. However, if you are looking for something sporty or a lot of fun to drive around, then you will probably will not enjoy the Toyota Camry. 


Thank you. Doveman here in the Epinions house!
