            I just recently bought a 2000 Dodge Durango and it is great!  I had a 1997 Jeep Cherokee which I had loved.  The keyword here is &quot;had&quot; loved.  Since the Durango I could not go back.  This truck has every option - leather, keyless entry, onboard computer, third seat, alloy wheels, infinity sound system and the BIG 5.9 liter 360 V8.  We tow a camper and this will no doubt do the job.  The big selling point was the motor and the room inside for a reasonable price when you compare to the Tahoe or Expedition.  

I have already customized my Durango with a bug guard and window flares.  It came standard with running boards and fender flares - it looks hot.  I have always wanted a flashy looking car - now I have it.  

This truck also handle great on ice and snow.  I live in northern Michigan so a 4x4 is handy.  Nothing can stop the big tires and the V8 power.  

The only bad part about this truck is my wife and I argue about who gets the Durango - well I guess we will have to share!<br><br>
