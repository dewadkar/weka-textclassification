            I'm not an engineer at the wonderful Jeep company. I'm just giving you a young, college aged girl's opinion on Jeep. If you want to be a Mac Daddy you need to be at the steering wheel of a Wrangler. Girls, no matter what their age, look at guys in Jeeps. And if us girls see a guy that's our age in a Jeep, we flirt. A lot. Nothing could gain the satisfaction that getting a date from a Jeep driving guy could. Here's what Jeep Wrangler says to us:

He's fun!
He's got taste!
He's hot!
He's cool!

Men, see why Jeep's (and their manly drivers) turn us on?

And hey, one more pointer. If it's summer time, why don't you take off the top, tear off your shirt, and go cruising? We women LOVE that!
