            I must admit, I haven't driven this car before...but we own one and I'm in it quite alot. I think that this is a great van. I'm the type of person that likes alot of room in the backseat and to feel really comfortable, and this van sure offers that! Good sound quility throughout the van for everybody to enjoy the music being played. A/C vents in the back so all the passangers can get their fair share of the air conditioner. You can comfortably sit about 6 people in the van(not including the driver :P) Also, when your on the road, you hardly feel the car moving at all, it is just one quit ride to wherever you're going. I went on a road trip for about 12 hours in this van, and there was not one problem that occured with it. What I'm tryin to say is the Plymouth Voyager is a really reliable car and it wouldn't let you down!<br><br>
