            I won't bother with all the details on this camera as a lot of the other reviews already have them.  I would just like to put in my two cents about it.

I found mine for $199.99 and thought I got a really good deal.  I read a lot about digital cameras and went to a lot of stores and played with all sorts of them.  

I finally broke down and purchased the A300.  I got a great deal.  This camera is terrific!

There are certainly a few cons but the pros definitely outweight them. 

I like that you can just point and shoot and get great pictures every time.  The camera can sense if the shot is going to be good or not and if it's not then it won't allow you to take it.  Adjust the light a little or your position and voila!!  You got yourself a great picture.  

Trasfering pictures to my computer could not be any easier with the included USB cable and provided software.  

I really like the sliding face plate that covers the lens when not in use.  

There is a button on top of the camera that when switched over will allow you to take a few minutes of video as well.  Really cool feature!

All the buttons are easy to manipulate and the interface is easy to follow.  There is a built in speaker for shutter sound effects or movie playback.

The quality of the pictures is extraordinary!  The color and clarity is amazing.

The biggest drawback to this camera is its battery abuse.  I highly suggest getting rechargeables for this camera.  It goes through double A batteries quicker than Ruben Studdard  goes through a double chocalate milk shake.  Also there is no optical zoom.  There is a 5.2x digital zoom but the more you use it the more fuzzier your pictures turn out.  Basically, if you want a good close up picture then you have to physically be close to what you are capturing.

All in all...great camera at a relatively good price.  I would reccomend this camera.
