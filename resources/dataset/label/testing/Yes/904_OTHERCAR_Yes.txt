            In December 99 I purchased the lincoln LS for my wife's birthday.
In my quest to find right car we test drove the BMW 528, the Lexus 300, the Mercedes 280 and last but not least the Jaguar S series.  I would be less than honest if I didn't say I would be proud to be the owner of any of these fine cars.  Then we saw an LS.  At first I couldn't tell what it was.  If you put all the cars above in a blender you might come up with the LS.  After a test drive and saying to myself, this can't be a Lincoln and my wife's feeling that it was the best looking of all the cars we had looked at the serious bargaining began.  Result, Silver LS 6 with sport package and select shift. 
    Now, how does she perform.  Last month we drove from Connecticut to Louisville Kentucky.  Ride and seating excellent.  Mileage 25.  Five head turns and 3 &quot;boy that's a beautiful car&quot;.  This car can give you a big head! Then the LS met the roads of West Virginia and Wow!  The lateral stability is amazing. Being built on a Jaguar chassis helps.  All in all the performance was more than I expected.  After 8,000 miles my wife Ann loves her Lincoln LS  &quot;Motor Trend Car of the year&quot;
     P.S. According to all my wife's friends I am now, &quot;Husband of the year&quot;
      This is a pleasant extra that Lincoln didn't mention. <br><br>
