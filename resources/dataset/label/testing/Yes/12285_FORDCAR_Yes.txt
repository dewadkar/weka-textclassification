            I purchased my 2001 Ford Ranger in December of 2000 and have been very satifsfied.  My particular model is a "fleet" model, not the more common XLT version, however the pricing was significantly lowered.  If plush seats, fancy pinstrips and hip rims are'nt your thing I highly suggest the "fleet" model. The performance is just as reliable and the price is alot lower.  For the near year that I've had it I've only experienced one electronic malfunction, which was likely due to my inexperience in cassette player installation, I did not correctly match the wires.  The dealership, Bob Baker Ford-San Diego, was great and it was even covered in the warranty.  They fixed the "fried" chip and correctly installed my cassette player at no charge and had my truck towed from the place where it broke down.  I've used the Ranger many times to help friends move heavy equipment, etc. and have had no problems.  Overall, I believe the Ranger to be a good deal and a very reliable and functional truck.
