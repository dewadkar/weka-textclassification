            The 1994 Lincoln Mark VIII is the best car I have ever owned.  It is expensive when brand new, but if you buy one that's 3 to 5 years old, you can get a great deal.  Lincoln makes a fine product and they stand behind it with the best service departments that I've ever dealt with.  The Mark VIII is a sharp looking 2-door coupe with sleek styling.  Once inside, you'll notice that it has all the &quot;creature comforts.&quot;  The fully-adjustable seats with lumbar support make long drives a pleasure.  The air ride system makes it glide down the road.  The JBL sound system is engineered specifically for this car and it's the nicest sounding factory system I've heard.  The engine is a quiet giant.  Do not be fooled by the number 4.6 -- this 4.6 liter engine puts out 285 horsepower and whiplash torque.  I had a Mustang GT before and this Lincoln will blow it away.  It does require premium fuel and the engine will &quot;talk&quot; to you when you get poor quality fuel or when you are just too cheap to put in the good stuff.<br><br>
