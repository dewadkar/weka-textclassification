            My kind and gracious brother decided to share the wealth that his job affords him this past Christmas, and told me to pick out a digicam under $700, and he would buy it for me.  What I ended up with(after 4 hours of comparing the million different brands that are on the market) was a Toshiba PDR-M4.  I  must say, I couldn't be any happier with it.

The camera's best quality is its ease of use.  Within five minutes of playing with it, I had the PDR-M4's controls completely figured out.  It's got the ease of a point and shoot 35mm film camera, with the results of an expensive SLR camera.  

With a choice of three sizes and three resolutions, you are able to take up to 85 pictures with the included smart media card.  There are several different modes which are well explained in the owner's manual, and good software is provided for developing your digipictures.  The included battery will last about all day, and warns you when it's about to run out of juice.  Also, there is an option to turn the LCD off to conserve power(except with the close-up macro mode).  Rubber grips and a wrist strap are also provided, for all the klutzes like me out there.

This camera is best suited for beginners, but it's alot of fun to almost anyone.  The only problem I've had since owning this camera is finding time to do other things like work and go to school.<br><br>
