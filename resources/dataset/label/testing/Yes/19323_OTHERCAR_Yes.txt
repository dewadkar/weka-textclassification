            I bought this camera for its price (Canadian $512= US$312)and features.
This is a fairly good entry level digital camera and it takes good picture under various good light conditions. Printing of 4R pictures provide good result.  5x7 inces picture printing is acceptable.  More than 5x7 inches produces unsatisfied results.

Features of the camera:
   - 1.31 million pixels
   - Fujinon 3xZoom lens F3.5/F8.7 
   - Zoom lens equivalent to 38-114 mm on a 35mm camera
   - 64 zones TTL metering exposure control(automatic program exposure)
   - White balance (7 modes selectable for manual control
     under different lights conditions)
   - maximum flash ranges is 11.5 ft with red eye reduction
   - macro lens
   - Fast USB port connection to PC

Any one will be happy with this camera if you can accept the 
fact that:
-its lens cover scratches the camera when slide opens.   
-all control has to be done on a very small (1.6 inches)
  screen which is not visible under bright sun.
-there is no connection to TV.
-it can only connect to USB port.
-it is only good for 4R size picture printing.
