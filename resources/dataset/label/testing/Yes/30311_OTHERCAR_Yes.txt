            I used to drive a 1985 Suburu GL wagon.  I loved this car and might still have it (well, probably not, but it would definitely still be running) if I didn't fall asleep one boring afternoon and drive over an embankment.  It was quite a loss.  I bought the car with 60,000 miles on it for $3000 and succeeded in driving it to 130,000 miles with no major repairs.  It used to get 30 miles per gallon!  I also read that Subaru was the first auto manufacturer to build a shift-on-the-fly FWD.  I was highly impressed with Subaru and still am!

Although I drive a Jeep Cherokee now and love my car, the Subaru SUS will <b>Definitely</b> be the next car I buy.  The Subaru offers AWD, anti-lock brakes, awesome gas mileage, traction control, comfort, and durability.  I WANT one!  I have been following Subaru for some time and taking some test drives.  Subaru made some huge advances in the AWD and traction control market.  No word of lie, the Subaru AWD can get you anywhere that a quality SUV can (except wilderness terrain) with twice the comfort.  It has excellent pickup for a family car and looks great!  I can't wait to be the proud owner of this vehicle.

<i>I know, I shouldn't have rated a product I do not own, but being a past owner of an older model, and a future owner of a new model, <b>and</b> a huge Subaru fan, I know that I am making a good recommendation to anyone looking to buy a car.  
<b>Check this one out!</b></i><br><br>
