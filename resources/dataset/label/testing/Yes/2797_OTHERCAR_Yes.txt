              We bought our D340R Olympus Camera during the summer of 99. It is now winter time and I still can't use it enought!!  We take it every were with us. The only thing that I would also recomend to anyone with a digital camera is a readwrite cd recorder!! It is so cool, all that we have to do is buy a blank cd and transfer the images from the camera unto the cd. You will have them for ever and ever!! The other cool thing that you can do with a digital camera is print pictures onto photo quality paper right from your home printer!! Beleive me it will save you in the long run! I have not used my 35mm camer sence we have bought this one! I love the features that is has and the easynest that is to use!! I would recomed this camera to anyone!
