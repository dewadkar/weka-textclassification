            We just bought a used 1998 Venture.  We had a 2 door suv, and loved the idea of 4 doors on a mini-van.  We did not get the electric sliding doors, because in the rain or wind they take to slow to close.  This is also the extended venture, which means lots of leg room in the far back seats.  2 adults, fit very comfortably in both the middle seats and rear.  Going on long trips, you and remove the seats of your choice and have a bed on the floor.  If you have a family or just like to drive on Sunday with friends, this is the van for you.  We really like it and it has only been 2 weeks, and one long trip.  It is easy in and easy out.  I would tell all my friends to forget the Caravans, and go to the Chey Venture.<br><br>
