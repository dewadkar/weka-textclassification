            June 1998, I had a 3 year old, was 7 months pregnant and driving a car with a broken A/C - not a lot of fun. A dealer called and said he had a car I would like at the price I wanted.  So I test drove it and an hour later brought home a 4-door, red 1997 Grand Am SE.    
He was right.  The only things I dislike about this car are the features I did not really want originally, an automatic engine and power W/DL. I wanted a standard with manual W/DL.  But I was surprised by the nice takeoff and smooth ride the 4 cylinder automatic engine offered. Now if I could just figure out how those automatic door locks work, it's been almost 2 years (yes, I admit to being a blonde).
Other than oil and tires the only things I've replaced have been the little knob that adjusts the driver's mirror and the front window motors which quit the same week my factory warranty expired.  This would have been an expensive repair without my extended warranty.
The '97 is still my favorite body style by far. I can be a mom driving a 4 door with cup holders and seat belt adjusters that still looks sporty and young (the car, not the mom). It is a great size for someone like me, who, at 5'1&quot; sometimes has trouble with the pedals and vision over the dash.  The down side though, is that I am forced to sit too close to the airbag.  
And what is good for me is not as comfortable for my 6'2&quot; husband who has a minimum of leg and head room.  Plus when he drives, he takes up all the extra space in the back seat leaving our daughter a little cramped. All in all, I love the car and hope to keep it for a long time.
