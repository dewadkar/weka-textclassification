            I love my Honda del Sol.  I first saw it at a Honda dealership in Mesa, Arizona, and it struck me as the most attractive car I've ever seen.  I had to look closer.  The engine, the V-Tec, is suprisingly quick, and it's relatively easy to work on.  The first time I got in, I was amazed at how comfortable it was.  There's just enough room for you and another to enjoy the drive, and nothing else.  I can honestly park my car anywhere I go!  And it has a HUGE trunk.  I purchased the manual transmission engine.  The clutch is really fast, but easy to use.  I've never driven a clutch before until I bought my del Sol, and it was a breeze to learn on.  My del Sol rides good, but you can hear a lot of the outside noise because there really isn't any carpet between you and the metal of the floor.  The best thing about the car is that I can take the top off and roll down the back window.  I think people who want a nice sporty car but don't have much money to spend are the prime candidates for this vehicle.  It dosen't cost a lot, because the makers cut some corners in making it, but I personally don't care about that.  I have a nice car for little money comparitively.  And the gas mileage is great.  Can you beat 32 miles per gallon?<br><br>
