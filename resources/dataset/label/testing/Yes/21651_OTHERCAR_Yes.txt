              I've always enjoyed owning Acuras, so when my dad was ready to upgrade his 8 year old Toyota Camry, I dragged him out to the Acura dealership. We ended up finding a great Acura Certified 1999 CL Coupe. It was in almost excellent condition-there really isnt anything noticably wrong with the car, except for a few dirt marks here & there. Even though he wasn't really planning to buy the car there & then, he did; he was very impressed.
  The CL's ride is mentionable.  There is very little engine noise from the 2.3 Liter V4 engine, and the ride is oh so smooth. It feels like you are going 40 mph when you are going 75. It's wonderful. The car accelerates quickly, but slows at the slight touch of the brake pedal. It's very easy to manuever & fun to drive. 
  Like most middle-aged people, my dad isn't normally too fond of coupes.  However, the CL's backseat is ridiculously spacious.  My mom, who has a back problem & could never sit in the back of the camry, happily jumped in the backseat & enjoyed the ride of our new Acura.  Its very roomy, and with us having 5 people in our household, surprisingly it worked out.  The head room is very giving as well, with room to spare.  And of course the front is more spaced out than more coupes, both in length & width.  Basically, you don't feel as if you are in a coupe.
  The features of the car are my favorite things about the CL.  It comes with all types of fun things that make it the luxury coupe that it is.  It comes with steering volume controls; a sun & moon roof (slides back or up at an angle); leather seats & leather interior; cd player; remote trunk opener; and so much more. 
  The Bottom Line: this car is fabulous. It's used & we couldn't be happier if we had bought a new car. It's safe, reliable, fun to drive, and most of all its an Acura.
