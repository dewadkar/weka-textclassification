            One day when I was looking through the Money Saver, which is a little paper that people around my area advertise stuff in, I found a little 3 line advertisment for a 1985 chrysler lebaron. The ad said that it ran great and only had 142,000 miles on it. I needed a second car to go to and from work so I called up and the guy and he told me all about the car and how he had just bought a new one and no longer needed this one and that he would sell it to me for $400! It was around 6:00 or 6:30 at night and i could not wait till tomorrow to go see it, so i asked the guy if we could come and take a look at it, and he said that it would be fine. While on the way there, I had grown skeptical about the car. I had now idea what it would look like or if it would even last more than a week. When I got there I was totally surprised. In the guy's front lawn sat this little two door brown car with a "for sale" sign in the window. I couldn't believe that this was for sale for only four-hundred dollars. That was before I even heard it running. After about 10 minutes of the guy showing me every part of the car I bought it. I had my two son's with me and my wife so she could drive our other car home. My oldest son thought that this car was so good. He drove home in it with me, and he thought it was so awesome. He calls it the "brownie" and now we use it more than our other car, the 1995 ford contour. The car is awesome for it's age (and price). It has power windows (which are no longer very powerful, they both seem to be off the track thing, and one of them has been broken out since I rolled it all the way down and it got stuck about half way up). The car also has a tilt steering wheel, a/c, and cruise control. The little four cylinder engine is fairly powerful with good acceleration. The speedometer goes up to 85 mph, and I've had it going about 75 without much trouble. This car is also more reliable than our other car, which I'm afraid is going to die on me sometime within the near future. The most annoying thing on this car is this ticking sound that comes from the speedometer after you get going, i don't know what causes it, but i know it's not from the engine. But overral this car is awesome. Anyone should buy one if they get the chance.
