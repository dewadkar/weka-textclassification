            Why are so few car dealerships open on Sunday?  If more of them were open one Sunday last September, I'd probably be writing about a different vehicle.  My husband works 70+ hours over 6 days each week.  Leaves little time for much of anything, let alone half a day to spend haggling over a new vehicle purchase.  We passed by an Isuzu dealership, noticed they were open, and after 4 hours of test drives, discussions over features, and the dreaded talk of payments &amp; interest rates, we were cleaning out the glove compartment of our trade-in and driving off in the Rodeo.

We're not total idiots though.  We did a bit of research into the vehicles we wanted to choose from.  We'd narrowed it down to the Honda CR-V and the Nissan Exterra.  Since the Exterra was a brand new design, there weren't many on lots around town, and we didn't really want to wait for one to be ordered.  The CR-V turned out to be virtually the same as the Rodeo, but with a few minor differences which made us lean toward the Rodeo.  The fact that a salesman was around to seal the deal is what finally put us in the Isuzu without looking further.

When we were thinking of trading in our '97 Taurus, we really wanted to get an SUV.  Living in Texas means that most of the people around you are in trucks, vans, or SUVs.  Pulling out of a parking space from between a Suburban and an Explorer meant taking my life in my hands... or at least endangering my car's rear end.  So, that was one motivation. 

The Rodeo has been a solution for that problem.  Even when parked next to a large vehicle, I can at least look through its windows to see what may be coming from beyond its girth.  Well, if the other vehicle's windows aren't tinted, that is!

Another reason we longed for an SUV was for the &quot;hauling&quot; capabilities.  What do we haul?  Groceries, luggage, computer equipment, junk acquired on shopping trips, boxes of postcards (don't ask), and an occasional person or dog in the back seat.  No boats, no building materials.  In other words, really nothing that wouldn't fit into a trunk.  But it just seemed like a more convenient way to drag around our stuff.  

It turns out that the Rodeo's storage capacity is only slightly more than a trunk.  True, you can pile things higher than in a trunk, but then there's that pesky problem of not being able to see out the rear view mirror.  There *is* a nifty storage bin in the back, which has been a great place for me to stash my purse when we go to a concert or sporting event and I don't want to carry it around.  (Notice to thieves who read this: I never have any money; I'm only protecting the $11.99 purse I bought at Target which holds all my junk.)  

So, what is my overall opinion about the '99 Isuzu Rodeo?  It is a slightly better than average vehicle for its price.  We got the scaled-down version in order to keep our payments similar to those of the Taurus.  We gave up power windows and power door locks and all those other must-haves on vehicles these days, but one bonus comes with buying the cheaper version: the spare tire is under the vehicle instead of sticking out like a sore thumb on the back.  I'm sure there is a valid reason for placing the tire on the back door, but I've yet to figure it out.  So I was happy to see ours was not designed that way.

My primary complaint about the Rodeo, aside from the fact that it costs more to fill the gas tank these days than if we had our old Taurus, is that it is quite loud.  There is a good deal of road noise when driving this vehicle on the highway.  And, this one has done a lot of highway travel!  We purchased the Rodeo in late September of '99, and I promptly drove it to New Jersey, from Texas, the following week.  In November we drove to Crested Butte, CO.  In December we drove to Wilmington, NC for Christmas and then headed to Buffalo, NY for New Year's (via Paramus, NJ!).  Oh, and we can't forget the &quot;side trip&quot; to Detroit from Buffalo before getting back to Dallas in early January.  Result?  One year later, and we've logged 24,000+ miles!  

However, even with all those miles in a short period of time, we've had no problems with maintenance. &lt;knock wood&gt;  

A slight, secondary problem would be with the seats.  For some reason, the driver's seat is more comfortable than the passenger's.  Maybe it's my imagination, but it feels like I am a lot closer to the dashboard when sitting on the passenger side.  Or maybe I'd rather be behind the wheel.  I just know that on a long trip, or after a full day's driving around town to shop, I feel somewhat cramped when I'm sitting on the right.

Bottom line: if you're looking to venture into the World of SUVs, then the Isuzu Rodeo is a good place to start.  

Will we trade in this one for another?  Probably not.  But, that's because I'm searching for a Chrysler dealership that is open on a Sunday.  I want a PT Cruiser!
