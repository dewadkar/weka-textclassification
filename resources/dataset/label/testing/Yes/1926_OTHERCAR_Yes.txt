              I have recently purchased the Nissan Maxima 2000 SE. I took my time in researching.  After test driving many other cars, I finally sat in a silver Maxima SE and stepped on the gas.  I could not believe I was in a 4-door luxury car that cost &lt; $30,000.  This car screamed, turned and felt like an expensive sports car.  
  Here are the important points I need to point out about this car:

#1 All though its a &quot;new&quot; model, the engine in this car is the same engine used in the 300zx for its lifetime so don't feel afraid of the engine having the same problems most &quot;new&quot; models have.
#2 This car doesn't HAVE a 4-cylinder option.  It was designed from the ground up to be the most exciting v6 4-door sedan you can find.
#3 The dash board is great and easy to use. (I LOVE the speed and tachometer dials, they invert black/white at night)
#4 The comfort is amazing. I cant imagine enjoying a ride better in a car that costs less than $60,000
#5 I was worried that an automatic would behave poorly on such a performance car, but it behaves predictably and quickly.
#6 It is incredibly roomy. I am 6'2 and 4 people my size can comfortably fit in this car. That does not even touch how much trunk space there is.
#7 The car is so quiet you might forget its on.  
#8 There is an AUTO UP!! feature for the driver's window. how many times have you used the auto-down to get drive through or to let air in then you have to hold down up.  I kept thinking what about just closing the window for me? This car will.  Its a small part I know but I smile every time I use it.
#9 Bose stereo with Sub-woofer sounds great! 

Whenever I get done with even a trip to the store I almost cry with tears of joy at how much fun and carefree the trip was.  If you have the means I highly recommend the Nissan Maxima 2000. (Silver is a nice color also)<br>
