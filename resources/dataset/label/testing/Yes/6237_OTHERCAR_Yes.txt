            I have the new 2000 Frontier Crew Cab truck and let me tell you that I thought when I bought that truck, I would like it.  I have come to love that truck!

I have had more comments from other people about the optional bed extender than any other option I ever had on any vehicle.  Men outside Lowes have stopped me and asked if I created it! It was a standard item on the 2000 SE and makes the bed into a standard 6 foot bed.  The bed looks really small on the pictures, but I have hauled 16 ft 1x4 lumber in the bed by using the bed extender and putting a ladder in the bed and placing the limber on top of the ladder!

The truck has fantastic engine response, handles like a dream and although it does ride like a much bigger truck, you get a full size feel out of a mid sized truck!  Lots of power and a lot of lookers!
