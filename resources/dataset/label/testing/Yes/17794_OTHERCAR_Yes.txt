            I really like my Grand Marquis, even though I am a touch out of the demographic for this car (27 Male at purchase). I was looking at the time for a Crown Vic, and couldn't find any. The Mercury dealer had a lot of these, so I bought one. I would highly recommend the big Fords, but consider the purchase price - about $3000 more new for the Mercury. 

Power - this thing has it. I can pull out and go from a stop, leaving a lot of people behind me. I don't have the traction control option, but don't have a real problem with the tires breaking loose. They grab and go, and the factory tires are still in excellent shape, even at 30,000 miles.

Mileage - not bad for a big V-8. It could be better, but then it could be a Geo Metro. I bought this for the looks and safety, not for the mileage. But 20 mpg isn't bad for the size of car.

Looks - sharp. In my epinion, the big Fords are really good looking cars. The Jaguar influence really shows through.

Reliability - not too bad. I've had it in for warranty work a couple of times, but not for anything major. Headlights clouded over (?), hazards quit working (Ford multifunction switch - chronic for them), noise from the front axle (hubcaps click - also chronic w/ no solution). Mechanically very sound and strong.

Comfort - got it to spare. This thing is cavernous inside, and the trunk would hold a couch. The seats are comfy, and it is actually fairly easy to get the baby into the middle of the back seat in his car seat.
