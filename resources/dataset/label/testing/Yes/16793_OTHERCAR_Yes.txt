                 Hi everyone my name is Chris.  I am 21 years of age.  I bought a 1999 Camaro SS (Super Sport) because at first all of my friends recommended me to this car telling me &quot;yes yes, you'll pick up girls, have lots of fun etc.&quot; I said why not try it.  I did a little bit of research on this car and I found out it was a pretty decent car. It Pushes 325 horse, V8 5.9 litter engine.  I thought &quot;WOH.&quot;  This thing is almost compared to a Corvette.

 I love many things about this car.  One thing I love about this car is the speed.  Guys, Gail's if you want a car that is not all that expensive and that has some major power, then you have to get this car.  At first I admit I had to learn to get use to driving this thing, but when you know how to drive it, what an adventure you will have.  Another feature I love and truly adore about the 2000 SS is the sound of the engine.  When you push it to the metal, you can hear all 325 horses kicking in.  This sound is the most beautiful sound you will hear.  I give the sound a 20 out of 10.  The last thing I also love about this car is the attention it brings to you.  This car brings me so much attention and I love it.  The entire girls and guys outside near the casino look and stare at the Camaro like it is a brand new R.R.  

 A few things I hate about the car, or should I say one thing in specific is the GAS.  I live in Michigan and the regular unleaded gas cost around $1.60 a gallon.  The worst thing I have to put premium gas into this car.  It cost me $1.89 a gallon.  When I fill it up it cost almost $50.00 bucks.  That is a heck of a lot of money.  I put a lot of miles on this car too, so I have to fill up every 3-4 days.  That's $100.00 a week almost 10% of my paycheck.  Another feature I hate about this car is how police officers always follow me.  Hey I am 21 years old and a police officer has to follow me just because I am driving a Camaro.  I hate that.  I'm driving home with my girlfriend and a cop follows me for 3 1/2 miles.  That's BS  The last thing I hate about it, is how it drives in the wintertime.  Here in Michigan, in the wintertime we sometimes get a lot of snow.  This car is offal in the winter.  It slips slides, spines, etc.  Let me tell you this if you ever get snow and you want a Camaro, you better save up and get you another car to drive around in the winter.  

 I think overall the Camaro is a great driving experience, but in the wintertime, it is an offal car to drive.  When you drive this car in the freeway, and you reach 150, 155 MPH, you feel like your flying.  When your driving in the city, let me tell you how good it feels to know you can beat 80% of the cars next to you.  It is a wonderful feeling if you enjoy a power type car.

 To tell everyone the truth, I think this car is made for an adult over 21, and under 35.  I think no one under 21 should be allowed to drive any car with over 250-horse power.  I think this because people are still young and might go out of control with this type of power.  God forbid if anything happens to anyone.  I think no one over 35 should drive this type of car because it is not there type of car.  If your over 35 and buying a Camaro SS.  I think you are wasting your money and throwing it all in the garbage.  If you can afford the SS, then you should get you like a Cadillac or BMW.  Hey I'm not telling you if youï¿½re over 35 do not bye the car, because it is a WONDERFUL car.  I'm just saying it does not look right.  <br><br>
