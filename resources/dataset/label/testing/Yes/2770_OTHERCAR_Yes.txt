            Mexico is a strange place to assemble a auto of this price i thought as i looked up and down the sides of my future car to be in the showroom back in the yeee old days of yesteryear or 1997... To write about a family car that has been ever so dependable is very easy for us to do, matter of fact it is about what we rave about here in our household on a frequent basis. First of all, i fell in love with the GLX model when i first laid my eyes and foot as i looked ahead while this &quot;pocket rocket sedan&quot; rushed me past everyone on the freeway in California , that alone made the deal. Well , after 38,000 miles and still no problems, our Jetta is still awesome like the day we bought it. 

I guess since the new model or New Jetta they call it is out, , my &quot;classic&quot; last series will still be a definite good buy even as a used car, 
since it boasts a 10 year warranty that can be transferred to another party, even though you may not need any work done since this car is a rock, and i have never had one lick of trouble.... my first Jetta was a 1991 and it
was as nice when i traded it in and probably is still on the road like new,
i hope they keep Toronado Red as a color and candy white since they are my favorites ! <br><br>
