            the year 2000 camaro z28 is the best of the new breed.  it beats the new mustangs around every corner. it has better acceleration handling and the sound of the exhaust is much deeper and throatier than even the previous years. ford has a lot of work to even keep up with this new pony. as an added bonus the camaro is very streetable for a factory race car especially with the optional 6 speed hurst shifter. it can spin tires at 40 miles an hr if the throttle is punched. its luminous view would make any stang owner just get out of the way before they get run completely over by the highly overpowering camaro.<br><br>
