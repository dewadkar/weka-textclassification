            I bought the Chrysler Town and Country van because Chrysler has been a very reliable car manufacturer, and this is evident in the Town and Country. Not very many minivans ride like a car, and have the comfort like a car. I was very surprised at how smooth and comfortable the ride was. 

The Chrysler Town and Country excels in comfort and style compared to the Ford Windstar, and Aerostar. The options of all wheel-drive, and the safety package really boosts the quality of this car. I believe that the Town and Country is superior to the others in its class. 

Another thing I liked about the Town and Country is the way the minivan handles. The Town and Country actually handles better than some compact cars I have driven. I was taken aback when I realized the handling abilities of the Town and Country. 

Another advantage of the Town and Country is the dual-sliding doors that are standard on this minivan. It was so much easier to get in and out of the Town and Country with the two sliding dooes. The amount of room in the van also surprised me. The option of bucket or captain seats is also a plus.

The only bad thing I noticed about the van, is the plain styling and high prices for a minivan. I would have guessed only $20,000 for a minivan, and I'm surprised that the styling wasn't as up to par as I expected.

If you want a reliable, comfortable, and smooth-handling minivan that rides like a car, than the Chrysler Town and Country is for you.
