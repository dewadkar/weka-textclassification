            This is the third Oldsmobile in the family and has therefore earned a great reputation with me. The Alero caught my eye with it's sporty, sleek look. Definately a change from the older large sedans. My Alero was purchased 1 yr old and hasn't given me any problems, major or minor.

Features:

The Alero comes with a standard 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine with an optional 3.4L V6. The transmission is a 4 speed automatic. I do not believe a manual transmission is available for the 2000 models. 

The trunk is quite roomy in this car. You can really pack a lot of stuff in there. And you can also fold down the back seat for transporting larger items. You can either fold the whole back seat down or only partially, it has a 60/40 split. The interior is also quite roomy. A friend of mine who is over 6 ft. tall was impressed that he had enough leg room to sit comfortably both in the back and front passenger seats. 

One of my favorite features is the electronic seat adjustment for the driver's seat that can move in 6 directions: front, back, up, down, tilt forward, and tilt backward. 

There are some other little neat features that I think are pretty handy. One is that the car has sensors that turn on the headlights automatically. And they go off by themselves too when you turn off the car. I'm glad I never have to worry about coming back to a car with a dead battery because I forgot to turn the lights off. The only downside to this is that if you are just standing idle somewhere, there is no way to temporarily turn off the lights. At least I haven't found a way. This was a problem for me when I had to pick up a friend and I'm waiting outside her apt bldg with my lights shining into someone else's apt. 

Another neat feature is that the car lets you know when your tire pressure is low. For those who don't check the pressure regularly this is a great feature. There is also a feature that lets you know when it's time for an oil change. Although I'm not sure this is accurate. My oil change light came on only a few weeks after having an oil change and I know it wasn't due again so soon. 

The gas mileage is also reasonable at about 27 city/31 highway. Not too bad for a mid size car. 

The comfort level of the car is above average. I drove across the country without too much discomfort, although the seats could be a bit softer. But it wasn't bad enough to cause cramping after driving all day. 

Although it's nothing too vital I felt this next thing was worth mentioning. The overall handling of the Alero is good but the car is not very smooth when making turns. I usually have to slow down quite a bit on somewhat sharp turns. Those sitting in the back seat can really feel the turns. But, this doesn't take away from the car's many benefits. With all the good things it has I would recommend this car to anyone.
