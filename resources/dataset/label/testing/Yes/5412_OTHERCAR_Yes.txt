            I bought the Canon A-5 because of it's feature rich package and the Canon name.  I have not been dissapointed!  The camera came with a very adequate 8meg card, cables to connect it to a PC and a rechargeable lithium ion battery.  The small size of this camera belies it's power and abilities.  It take great 1024 x 768 pictures and has fantastic color clrity and resolution.  The glass lenses are the best available on a digital camera and as usual, Canon delivers!  Anyone needing instant access to photos, insurance adjusters, law enforcement, realtors and the like would be well served by this little powerhouse.  an extra battery and flash card in the 40meg range are essentials but the camera is very useable right out of the box.  Imagine taking a picture, downloading it to your PC, manipulating it to your tste and then printing it to your hearts desire.  An absolute must in conjunction withthis camera is a good Bubblejet printer.  I chose the BJC-6000 and have been amazed at the picture quality output.  What a joy to use both! <br><br>
