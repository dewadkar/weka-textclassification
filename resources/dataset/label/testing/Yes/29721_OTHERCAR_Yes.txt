            The Acura Vigor is one of the best cars I have ever driven.  My Brother-in-Law purchased this vehicle at an auction in California a couple years back.  When he asked where this vehicle came from, a man from the auction company told him to picture the worst possible place/situation a vehicle could be in...and that it's worse. 

Well he drove it for a couple years and then he bought a Mercedes and shipped this car to my mother in New York 1.5 years ago.  By then it had 160,000 miles on it and was running in great condition.  The car handles great(according to my Brother-in-Law it handles better than his Mercedes).  The ride is smooth.  The car is comfortable but only for not very long distances.  It is extremely reliable and that is not from the perspective of an 8 year old car with 160,000 miles on it but in comparison to other cars which are 4 or so years newer with 100,000 miles less on the odometer.  The sound system is excellent and then there are the little amenities that I appreciate.  This includes a stereo system that if the cars power is disconnected you need to punch in a code to enable it again.  Then there is a feature where if you press lock from the drivers door it will not lock the drivers door.  You have to lock it with your key so this reduces your risk of being locked out which is helpful especially for people like me.  

The car has it downsides too.  There is very little leg space for adults in the back.  If you are mainly only driving with one passenger or usually only have children in the back then this isn't much of a problem.  The car doesn't have enough power until I get to around 40.  After that, I feel the car kick and then it speeds up rapidly.  Also the car sits very low to the ground which is hard for tall and elderly people to get in and out of.  

Overall though I think this is a great car.  I love it, it handles great and it suits my mothers needs as well as mine when I borrow it when I am in town(which is very often).  If you're looking for a car with great dependability this is the car for you.<br><br>
