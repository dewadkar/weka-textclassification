            This is absolutley the pinnacle of American engineering.  The Viper has it all going for it;  speed, handling, great looks, roominess, comfort, and best of all, when you drive it you instantly are pleased.

The Vipers have huge 10 cylinder engines in them, giving off an impressive amount of horsepower.  These cars can do 0-60 easily in the 5 second range, which is very impressive because it is huge compared to tiny, foreign sports cars.  

Also, the sweet curves and wonderous shape of the car make it an instant favorite on anyone's list.  It doesn't matter who you ask, everyone likes the Viper's design.  It's good to see a different shaped sports car every once in awhile.  


The only question that remains is, is this car worth the 70k you must put up for it?  If you want to race it, DEFINITLY!!  The Vipers win almost all autocrosses they go to, competing against the likes of Porsche 911's, Firebirds and Camaros.  But overall, before you buy this you must consider:  What would you rather have, a 2000 Viper or a 2000 Boxter and $30,000?<br><br>
