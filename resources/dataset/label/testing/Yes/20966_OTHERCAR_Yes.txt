            Unlike other PT Cruiser owners who think they own a Hot Rod, I know that I have a 2001 production vehicle.  I would never dream of having my car on display at a car show.  Well, that opinion may have changed today (just a bit).  

I picked the car up with it's new flame paint job on Friday.  Today, I went out to run some errands. Got a "Nice paint job!!" at the gas station and had another Cruiser almost cause an accident as he slowed down to rubberneck.  Nothing I did not expect, but nice none the less.

But that ain't the best part....
As I was driving across town, I saw a Car Show at the Harley-Davidson dealership parking lot. I pulled in and parked. As I was walking around the show, there was a crowd of people looking at my car.  

Then, I got invited to show the car at two upcoming car shows. I knew this was not just an ordinary flame job, but getting compliments from owners of real hot rods was beyond any expectations.

Here are a few pictures of it.  Not too many yet.  As I said I just got it on Friday.
