            I bought the Ricoh RDC-300Z, about 2 years ago around Christmas Time.  Back then it was around $400.00, but the price has come down since then.  

Negatives:

If not using the adapter, the batteries run out within a few hours.  This is probably the case for all digital cameras though.

The zoom is really just more of &quot;macro&quot; option where you can zoom in on small ornate things such as a flower, bug, or small print.  It's not a zoom feature for seeing far away things up close.

Positives:

Very easy to learn how to use.
Very light weight and more compact than most digital cameras I've seen!
I take this camera everywhere and hardly ever use my regular camera.
Crisp and clear pictures!<br><br>
