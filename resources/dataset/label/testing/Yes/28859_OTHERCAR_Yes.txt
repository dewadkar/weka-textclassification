            I've been wanting a digital camera for quite some time.  I don't have a lot of room to display pictures, so I prefer to save them to disk.  When I want to print a picture, its easy to do with the software included with the Kodak DC210.  I also find I take more pictures because I can see them immediately.  Anyone who can use a camera can use this Kodak.  I chose Kodak because of their reputation.  The pictures I have taken and printed on my printer look as good as the ones I've had developed professionally.  With the high prices of digital cameras, this is in the mid range, which makes it more affordable. <br><br>
