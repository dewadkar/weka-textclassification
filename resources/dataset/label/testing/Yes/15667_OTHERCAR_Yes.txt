               The top of Sony Mavica's camera line is a great buy.  Overall, the picture quality is great.  The mode options are few, but the gadget options make up for it.  You get a quality zoom and a anti-shake feature -- usually only found in video cameras.  But, the most appealing feature is it's design.  All the other cameras looked the same, this one stood out.
   When I saw this camera I knew it was the one for me.  I only had a few requirements -- 1024 x 768 or greater, zoom, and LCD screen.  I compared the &quot;91&quot; to other cameras and for an enthusiast I didn't see a difference, although a professional would probably argue me on that.
   After using the camera I did find a couple of weak points.  Namely the low light capability greatly diminishes the value, because the flash is only effective for only about six feet.  And the save time for a &quot;standard&quot; mode (not tested in &quot;fine&quot; mode) picture leaves a delay that could limit the effectiveness of this camera in an action situation.
   If you're looking for a good camera, money isn't an option, and you want the coolest looking thing around this is the camera for you.<br>
