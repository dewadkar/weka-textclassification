            My 1999 CLK convertible is now 8 months old and I still love it. First, it is not a sports car (which I had for the past 14 years), so it does not handle, especially on curves, like one. That takes getting used to, but is easily learned. The good: the top folds into the trunk and is covered by part of the car. The look is magnificent. However (the down side), it takes seemingly forever for the entire action to be completed. That means that one cannot put the top down at a light--as I used to do. Another down is that about 1/3 of the trunk is taken by top storage, so be careful of what you want to travel with. And, this is a superb traveling car. The ride is smooth, the sound system wonderful. Service is needed only 10-15,000 miles and a digital message appears when one is within 2,000 miles of service. The car is built to perform perfectly without much service. We'll see. The phone (an option) is hands free and wonderfully clear.

My major disappointment with this car is that the headlights do not go on or off automatically. Buzzers buzz when the lights are left on, but it should have been manufactured, as nearly all new cars are, with this feature.<br><br>
