            I have had my 2002 Maxima SE 6 speed for a year and a half (leased new). Aside from taking it in for leaking power steering hoses (tightened), it has been flawless. It has also been very fast. It has a computer generated mpg number of 28.8 currently, and that's with me driving it aggressively. I have never had the space to unwind it all the way (nor the nerve), but I make a lot of high speed passes, and it hits 100 mph before you can blink. Torque steer? Yes, there is some, but I have a Thorsen differential, so it's never been a problem. Have had much worse from an Eclipse. 

I will say that I still don't feel completely competent with the 6 speed, and I've driven a lot of sticks. Some have suggested that the drive-by-wire system artificially keeps revs raised between shifts, and that may be true.I'm not able to get that little blip of revs as I go into a downshift like I'm used to. I've just never gotten rid of some very amateur feeling shifts. While passing at speed on the highway, though, I down shift to 5th, then 3rd, then back up to 4th with no problems. Don't really get it. 

Handling is good, not great. If you've driven a Miata or a new Celica, you've driven a great handling car. This car is not in their league, but few cars are.

I find the firm seats comfortable, and the driver setup very intuitive. 

Overall, I love this car and will purchase it at the end of my lease. I have owned/leased 4 Maxima SE's and this is far and away my favorite.
