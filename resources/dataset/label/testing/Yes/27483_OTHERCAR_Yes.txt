            In Automatic mode this camera takes photos at 1536 x 1024 in either high or low quality. In Program mode you can also take photos at 768 x 512 again at high and low resolutions as well as high and low quality. The 8MB CF card holds around 60-80 low-res shots at high quality, 120-160 low-res shots at low quality, and only about 4-5 shots in CCD Raw Mode.

For those who have extreme storage requirements, this camera supports the 170MB and 340MB IBM MicroDrives. I personally use a 40MB and the 8MB CF Cards.

Because of the 2-6+ second autofocus delays, you can right off taken action photos with this camera.
