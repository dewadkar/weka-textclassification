            My Dad bought a new Honda CRV this year. He was not even looking for a new car and actually just stopped in the dealer to look early one morning while killing some time.  He had a 91 Accord and had no real intentions of trading.

He stopped by the dealer really early and thought that since it was early in the morning, nobody would be working.  Well, one agent was there, talked him into a test drive, and the rest was history.  traded on the spot.  The CRV was very surprisingly roomy in the back seats.  I was accustomed to very cramped conditions and since he bought the CRV and not the Passport, I expected legroom to be very cramped.  Man was I surprised to find that 4 adult men, we're big, could fit comfortably in the CRV and even stretch out and relax.

He now has about 36,000 miles on the CRV and loves it more every day.  The only complaint I see is that the leg room on the passenger seat is a bit small, although the back seat legroom is ample.

Fantastic Buy!<br><br>
