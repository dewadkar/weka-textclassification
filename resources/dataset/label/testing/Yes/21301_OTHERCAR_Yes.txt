            I just thought I should write an opinion on this car, because it has been very good to me in a bad situation.  My parents bought their Sundance new in '94.  Since than my father has put almost 90,000 miles on it.  Even with all those miles there have been no major repairs on it.  Right now I am a very disapointed owner of a '95 Dodge Neon, which as been nothing but problems.  I have been told that i need at least $1,000 worth of repairs on it, and still i'd have a car with no air which went out at 40,000 and would be over $500.  With only 51,000 miles on it i have decided to get rid of it.  So i went out looking and settled on a 2001 Toyota Corolla.  The kicker is that is wasn't going to be made for a month after i purchased it.  So i was stuck with a car that's timing belt could go at any time.  My father said i could take his car to work instead of driving my car.  Let me just say this Sundance is so much better of a car than my Neon.  Since i started driving it there have been some freezing Madison days here.  Days where even newer cars might not start and this car has started everyday without problem.

I love the reliabilty of this car.  The only repairs have been recalls and regular matinence.  The pick up it pretty good.  

so far there have been a lot of things i love, but there are few small things i hate.  However for the price, i'd much rather have reliabilty over these things.  The radio is very bad, just turning it up slightly causes static.  Too boxy, when it snows the snow just sticks right to the front lights because the surface in front of the lights is too flat.  Gas mileage is pretty poor now, it was much better before though.  

Overall i really enjoy driving this car.  I find it very comfy in the front, the back is not too bad for a 2 door car.  The wind noise is pretty obvious now, though the only time it can be real bothersome is when it is really windy outside.

I would suggest this car for anyone looking to buy a cheaper used car.
