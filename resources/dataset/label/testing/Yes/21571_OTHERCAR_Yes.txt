            I bought a used 1995 Dodge Intrepid in 1996. I paid $12,500. I compared the Intrepid to the Ford Taurus, and learned that the Intrepid has more interior space, for less money.  That summer 5 adults took a 2 week road trip in the Intrepid.  We spent a good deal of our trip in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado ---- Rocky Mt. National Park actually.  The car ran flawlessly at high altitude. The Intrepid does well in city traffic such as Denver.  The 5 of us were able to still talk to each other at the end of our road trip.  All of us commented how the Intrepid made our lengthy road trip fun, and comfortable.  I spent some time as a passenger, and I can say I enjoyed the huge backseat.  We have the smaller engine, and in Montana's &quot;Autobahn&quot;, I-90, we had no trouble keeping up with all the other 90 mph traffic.  The only little mechanical glinch we've experienced is the odd cigarette lighter that somehow blows fuses that operate the horn?  Nobody in our family smokes, or uses the lighter; the wiring is just a bit off. We got rid of the lighter &amp; the problem.  We consistently get mileage in the 25 mph range. The car has plenty of space, power, and &quot;creature comforts&quot;.  It has over 75K miles now. I change the oil at 3000 miles.  There is a tiny bit of road noise at speed.  But for the money, the car is a good touring rig.  We plan to keep this car for some time.    <br><br>
