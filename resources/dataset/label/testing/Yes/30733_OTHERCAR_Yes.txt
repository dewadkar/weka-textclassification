            Having decided that it was time to upgrade to a minivan for the space and convenience, the names that obviously came to mind to consider were Honda and Toyota.  However, I have a Nissan Maxima (see my other review on that) and am a big fan of Nissans so I eagerly awaited the arrival of the 2004 Quest before making a decision.

While the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna are great vans, I'm sure, there really is nothing like the new Quest.  Just as background, we ended up not looking at the Honda because, in all honesty, too many people have the Odyssey - standard Honda-fare...reliable but boring and one on every street corner.  We took a look at the new Sienna and were completely disappointed with the exterior styling, but especially the cheesy black paneling and cheap feel of the interior - didn't even bother to take a test drive because if a car doesn't excite you, who cares if it's reliable.

When we saw the new Nissan Quest, we immediately knew this was the one.  The exterior styling was beautiful - Nissan really has a leg up on the others when it comes to making a car look exciting.  From the side, all the lines are right - especially the way the roof slopes down towards the rear.  From the front, the headlights and grill look solid and ready for business.  From the back, it almost looks like an SUV.

The interior was even more exciting.  I loved the center console.  It takes a little bit of time to get used to, but it is SOOO unique.  The seats are all comfortable and made of high-quality cloth.  And then, there is the interior room.  There is so much room inside.  You really wouldn't think so from looking at the outside, but once you step inside, it's cavernous.  I think I was actually told that the passenger room is actually more than either the Honda or Toyota (I think the Toyota has more cargo space because the roof doesn't slope down in the back - it's more boxy and so gets a few more cubic feet of storage).  Each row provides plenty of legroom - the second row can actually be pulled forward or back to provide more legroom for the third row.   The third row sits higher up - kind of like stadium seating so that you don't feel cramped back there.  Definitely really comfortable seating for 7.  The second row seats fold down to provide an adequately-flat surface - it's not completely flat, but it suffices when you need more cargo space.  The third row seats do fold completely flat - but it is a little bit of a chore to fold them down.  You have to take off the headrests (and store them in a bag that is provided) - then you kind of have to yank hard to pull it into it's storage space.  But with the second and third rows down, you have an enormous amount of storage space (can basically camp out back there).

Some other interior features - tons of cup holders and storage bins, shopping bag hooks (you wouldn't believe how convenient these are), lights everywhere, rear a/c controls, the list goes on - and the model we got was the base S model which came standard with all of these things.

Then, there is of course, the engine and the driveability.  It really is quite amazing how well this van drives and how much power it has - minivans have come a long way, but this Quest really shines.  Acceleration is NOT a problem.  Braking and handling are great as well - not quite like my Maxima, but hey.

I could go on and on about this van - really, you need to take a look at this van before settling with the Odyssey or Sienna.  You will be impressed.

Now, I feel obligated to share with you some negatives.  First, as another reviewer mentioned, the fit and finish of the Quest definitely has room for improvement.  Our Quest has less than 5000 miles, but there is definitely some creaking and squeaking going on.  One of the sources of the creaking was the side door apparently being a little loose (not good), so they tightened that and the sound went away.  But still, my guess is that Nissan probably doesn't have the same level of rigidity that maybe the Sienna has.

Another major negative for us, though this is hopefully just isolated to our experience, is that the van had a defective transmission hose or tube - it had a tiny hole in it which caused the fluid to leak and then the effects of the low transmission fluid came to light the other day.  While we were driving the van starting to go in and out of gear and then quickly degraded to being undriveable.  We had to have it towed into the dealer where they found this defect.  Again, hopefully, this is limited to us and not a general Quest problem, but still...not a good thing to experience in the first 5000 miles.  I would suggest getting an extended warranty on this if you plan on owning the van, because there so many technologically complicated parts, that I'm sure the warranty will pay off - we ended up getting a 7 yr/100K warranty.

All in all though, the Quest is an awesome van! I hope our transmission problem doesn't keep you from buying this van because I'm sure something like that could happen in any vehicle.  Like I said, there are too many Odysseys, the Sienna is ugly...the Quest stands out and is fun (a real head-turner for a minivan).  Hope this helps.
