            I got my fuji finepix over a year ago and its still working great (it better for the 750 that I paid).  Its size, durability, build, and finish is perfect!  I use the movie feature just about everywhere.  Its perfect for my website and sharing vids online.  The LCD is nice and clear, and the control is easy.  The picture quality during the day is great.  At night, however, it can be difficult to get a clear shot.  
Although the cam can do up to 2400 res, I never really use it.  1280 is sufficient for just about anything I do.    
The USB interface is very convenient as all I have to do is plug it in and it comes up as a removable drive that I can even browse.  
The rechargable AA batteries are convenient because I can just go to a local radio shack and buy some (don't have to order a OEM battery).
After I upgraded to a 64MB smartmedia card, I didn't really have any problems fitting a day's worth of pictures in.  what makes it even better is the recent huge drop in smartmedia prices!  You can get a 128MB card for 60! 
Well back the to cam.  The timer feature is nice although sometimes it would be nice to have a remote for it.
After over a year of use and even with all the new technology in digital cams out today, I dont' see a need to upgrade for a while, as the 4700 more than adequately does everything I need a digicam to.
