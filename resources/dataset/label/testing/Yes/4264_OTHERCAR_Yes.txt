            Let me tell you, the beemer is sporty, powerful, and an all around fun car. The 318 is a classic example of all of the quality vehicles made by BMW, It has everything, nothing's missing, and I would prefer a beemer any day over a Mercedes or a Jaguar. The Germans simply make the best cars. I just tapped the gas at an intersection and I was already way ahead of the cars next to me. I tested the acceleration against my friend's Jaguar, and there was no competition. I totally blew him out! Also at about 23 grand this is one of the cheapest BMW's, but defitnely not one of the worst. Thanks for reading my opinion and check out my other write-ups!<br><br>
