            My wife needed a new car this summer.  Her 95' Grand Am was getting a few miles on it, and was ready for a trade in.  We went out looking for a vehicle that was a step or two up from this one.  We concentrated on the Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima, and a few GM models. It didn't take long to see that the Maxima was head and shoulders above the rest of them.  

This car had more power, style, room, and most importantly, attitude than anything else in its class or price range.  With over 220hp, you'd never know this car is a four door sedan!  I couldn't believe how much power this car has on tap.  It runs like a sports car, seats 5 people without being crowded, and still manages to get excellent mileage. The ride is nice and especially quiet.  You won't be feeling tar strips or hear the wind shreaking by in the Maxima! The other thing that makes this car stand out is its aggressive styling.  Nissan managed to give this car a look that is the perfect balance between &quot;luxury&quot; and &quot;sporty&quot;.  Personally, Camry's put me to sleep with their looks, and the Accord isn't too far ahead.  The Maxima just shouts &quot;let go, right now!!!&quot;.  

If your looking for a four door for yourself or your spouse that won't make you feel like your getting old, this is it.  Don't buy it if your looking to tone down your image, or your heart rate!  I'd have to rate this as the best combination grocery getter/sports car I've seen.  <br><br>
