            I'll have to admit I was a little unsure when considering buying a Civic... even the Si.  Somehow, the Civic just seems like a kids car that you'd expect to see with some teen with his hat backwards, blasting music, and laying down so far in his seat that you can barely make out that anyone is driving.  Well, okay so maybe it is, but the Si is such a fun car to drive, that who really cares who else has the car?

I bought my 2000 Si as one of the very last ones (if not THE last) to hit the lots before the 2001 style emerged, and the Si was no more.  It was one of the better decisions I made.  The stock handling is great.  The stock wheels and suspension provide a comfortable ride, but can still hold up in hairpins.  The power lacks slightly in the low RPMS, but the Civic was designed to be driven in the higher RPMs, hitting amazing power at around 6k. 

Style is something the Civic has, but they are common enough to hide some of that style.  But get behind the wheel of the Si, and open it up, and you'll see, feel, and hear the style it has.  It's plain inside, but everything works, and will always work. After 2 years, i've had 1 thing break... a fuse (to my cigarette lighter, at that). 

The other great thing about the car when I bought it.. no options!  Absolutely everything you could ever want comes completely standard. Sunroof, power everything, leather steering wheel, shift knob, etc.  Makes comparison shopping a whole lot easier :)

You won't find a more fun, reliable machine on the road for such a great price (around 17K used).
