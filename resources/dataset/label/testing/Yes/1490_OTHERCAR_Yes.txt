            This is a pretty cool car. The Saturn has some awful nice options I wish my car had. Namely the panels are some sort of plastic so you can bang them up real good and they don't dent. To demonstrate this the salesman literally kicked the door, and offered us the chance to do the same to the demo car. We did it, kicked the door real good, and it didn't dent. It pushed in then popped right back out, that was so cool. All cars ought to be made out of that stuff. Oh wait, it would drive out of business lots of auto body guys, so no way those damn unions would allow this.
Another nice thing about the Saturn is his gas mileage. His Saturn has a smaller tank than my Z34 and yet he has greater range. He has to be up around 35 mpg on the highway. I find that excellent, but it is of course a trade off, he lacks the power of larger engines. That is something I find sad about the Saturn, they make no decent engines for power. Not everyone can make a sports car I suppose. A convertible would be nice..
But back to the topic. The Saturns are priced and non negotiable, I find this crazy. How can you have options thrown in as incentives to purchase the car if you are just adding up extras, no negotiation ? I dislike this very much. There is little or no room to make offers unless you are dealing with their used cars. More annoying things: they tell you no one else can do oil changes on the car as they use some special filter. Well, that is no longer true as my brother can take his car to the jiffy lube and they do it there. He has put many miles on his car and after only 3 years it rattles almost everywhere.
It is a nice little economical car, he has had no problems with it when it comes to driving. If you are interested in a smaller car, with good mileage, low insurance rates and cool doors you can kick!- Saturn.<br><br>
