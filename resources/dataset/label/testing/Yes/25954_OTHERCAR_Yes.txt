            I recently purchased a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am SE (2 door). I absolutely love it! Of course I wanted a little red sports car - (a BMW would have been nice), but I couldn't swing the hefty payments. So, I opted for the Grand Am. I got a lease - it's around $200 a month. Did I mention that I love this car? It's fast - V6 engine, sporty - 2 door yet there's tons of room in the back seat. It's everything I wanted, yet I can still afford to eat! 

I would definitely recommend this car to anyone, especially if you want a new car and can't afford a large car payment. This is my first American car so I didn't know if I would like it or not but I really do.
