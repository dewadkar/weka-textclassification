            This review will cover a couple of "firsts" for me.
It's the first review I have written about the first digital camera I have ever owned.  Keep that in mind, as you read this: my only frame of reference is my expectations of the camera.

Ever since I have owned a scanner, I have been thinking about getting a digital camera.  I bought the scanner because I was under the mistaken impression it would solve my email picture problems.  Take a picture, get it developed, scan it and voila, send it off.  Well, it's not quite that easy - waiting is the hardest part.
So the opportunity to get the convenience of instant pictures for a hundred bucks ws too great.  I saw the ad, but really couldn't believe it: A digital camera & web cam for $99 CDN?  I had to go to the store and check it out.
My first impression was disappointment.  It turned out the price was only for "factory reconditioned" units, but there was a full one year warranty (from the manufacturer, at the store) and the store has a 15 day return policy.  As well, there was another customer there who was buying his second one for his wife.  He has had one for 6 months, and couldn't say enough about it.  I figured that given the price and the return policy, I had nothing to loose.
I rushed home to try out my new purchase.  I have lots of experience with regular cameras, but none with digital cameras, but from opening the box, to installing the software to viewing my first photos took all of 15 minutes - not bad!  Just what I wanted: speed and convenience.
I was also very (pleasantly) surprised to discover all the stuff it came with: A soft case, 2 straps (one for the camera, and one for the case), batteries (Duracell ultra), a small tripod (the manual says for use with the Web Cam, but it small enough to carry around and I use it for timer pictures), a USB cable, a cable for hooking the camera to your TV or VCR and software (driver and photo/video-editing).  Wow! I really didn't need anything else, I was really liking this purchase.
As I mentioned, I don't know a lot about digital photography, but With a quick read of the instructions, I was taking pictures instantly.  I hooked the camera up to my TV (with the included cable)to try out that feature.  The pictures are not great, but it would be fun at a party, and if you are not near your computer, allows you to keep/ delete pictures you have taken.
I also tried out the Web Cam feature.  Having never done this before, I will say that I also found this to be very easy to do.  Again, the pictures were not crystal clear, but are more than adequate for keeping in touch with friends and family.
One thing I really liked then (and like more now) is that it has a USB port.  This allows me to download 16 pictures to my PC in about 15 seconds.  It also means that I didn't have to worry about buying memory cards or card readers to download my pictures- (have you seen how much those cost?)!
As for the picture quality, this would be my only disappointment. I have seen digital pictures before, and while I don't expect them to match regular pictures (even with professional equipment), these were pretty bad:  you would not want to frame these, even at a modest 4x6 print size.
But that's OK, because I bought this camera specifically for emailing pictures, and for that, it's adequate.  The pictures do lack sharpness, and you must hold it steady when taking a picture, but for instant gratification, it does the job.
Things I like:
Price
Everything you need is in the box
Ease of use
Self timer
USB connection
It's also a Web Cam!
Things that could be better:
Picture quality
Can't add memory (only 32 pics at low quality and 16 at high)
All things considered, I am not disappointed with this "impulse" purchase.
