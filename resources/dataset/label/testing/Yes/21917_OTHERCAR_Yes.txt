            We had just returned from a 4 year stint overseas and two of those years we remained carless.  Talk about the itch to have a new car.  We had to buy two cars and fast.  My husband and Father-in-Law are car fanatics they know more about a car then I would ever care to know.   Just give me the keys, show me where the stereo is, the sunroof button, the mirrors, wipers, the hazards, the a/c and we're off.  I don't much care about the minimum turning circle (which, by the way, is 37.7 ft.) just let me get out of a parking spot and onto the other side of the street, quick!  I don't much care about the maximum output at engine speed (189 hp/5900 rpm) or the maximum torque at engine speed (181 1b-ft/4700 rpm) or even the top speed for that matter (130 mph) it goes from 0-50 in 7.6 seconds- just get me to the hospital NOW! (my words in labor).  

We had always wanted a BMW but were put off by the price tags.  My husband happened upon a specialty dealer, while perusing the Sunday paper.  The dealer only sells pre-owned (used) BMW's.  That's it! Nothing more, nothing less.  We went.  We were both salivating over this Bronze colored 525i.  The price was right, the mileage was right, the condition was perfect.  We signed.  It was a 1992 BMW 525i with 13,000 miles on it. Impossible,  but true.  Maybe it came from Guam.  I only put 3,000 miles on my brand new Acura Integra in two years.  We spent 2 years of our 4 year assignment here.  The island was so tiny you could drive around it in an hour.

Anyway, 4.5 years later we are still in love with this car.  I get so excited when I can take it (my husband tends to hog it).  It is not the &quot;Family&quot; car.  It sits 5 comfortably but is not child-seat friendly.
We have an automatic, so it's a breeze to drive.  It handles beautifully and has a quiet ride.  The drawbacks, it is rear wheel drive so does not respond well in the snow.  This model only has the driver air bag. It doesn't have a proper cup holder. Other than that.  Perfect.  We do all the scheduled maintenance on time and the minor recall issues (sensors, etc) were handled during the checkups.  It gets about 19-21 mpg.  We don't have the cd player but, will get one next time.  The stereo/speakers are excellent, dashboard is user friendly, all-leather seats, wood package, windows and seats are easy to operate.

The trunk is a nice size (16.2 cubic feet)but nothing is big enough for my husband.  We talk about getting an SUV but my car will have to go, first.

This is the kind of car where you want to open the sun roof, turn up the stereo and just drive.....fast.  I highly recommend the BMW 525i for anyone looking for a pre-owned vehicle.  You probably won't find one with low mileage as BMW owners love to drive these cars, a lot and on long trips.  (we got lucky!)<br><br>
