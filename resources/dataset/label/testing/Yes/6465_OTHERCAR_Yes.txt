            I bought my 1995 Camry XLE in 1998.  It had 34,000 miles on it when I bought it.  I can honestly say that in the 2 1/2 years I've owned it, absolutely nothing has gone wrong with this car.  I mean nothing!  

It also is the most comfortable car I've ever driven.  Consumer Reports has compared the 1995 Camry XLE's ride with that of the Lexus.  I agree.  There is hardly any wind or road noise and the car responds incredibly well.  I've received so many compliments about my car from passengers.  They are overwhelmed by its quietness and smooth ride.  

The body style is also one of the most attractive on the road.  I've had numerous people tell me how they LOVED my car.  They cannot believe it's 5 years old.  A couple of these people have since bought their own Camry's.  

I fully expect to have this car for another 5 years.  I was reassured of this possibility the other day when I ran into a Camry owner of 12 years.  His Camry had well over 200,000 miles on it.  AND IT STILL LOOKED GREAT!  When I do finally buy another car, it will most definitely be a Camry. <br><br>
