                Well, this is the ONE.  That's what I told myself when I finally bought this car.  When I starting looking for the VR6 GTI in the 1999 (A4) body-style, there wasn't one in the state.  So I left the state.  Color was important initially, but when I found out how difficult these cars were to come by, I grabbed the first one I saw with a window sticker.  (It's silver.)  There was no haggling.  In Washington, which is where I bought it, I was lucky the dealer wasn't one which added an extra markup--a &quot;second sticker&quot;--which most of the dealers out there were doing even with the Plain Jane GLs. 

     Enough background.  After a bit more than 10,000 miles, the car is ready for its second oil change.  It's also ready for its second minor repair.   The cruise control is working only intermittently.  Hopefully they'll be able to fix it.  The first little problem was that fourth gear produced a rattling shifter.  They adjusted that, but once in a while it still shakes a bit.  Something else which makes me wonder is the racket under the hood.  Maybe it's perfectly normal, but an intense gurgling sound after even short drives is something I haven't heard before.  

     Now for the good news.  Bought the car in June by the way.  Drove it cross country in July.  It's truly great for long trips.  The seats may not seem so special at first, but I found myself remarking over and over how unexpectably good my back felt after another 1,000-mile day.  Its stability at high speeds is also impressive.  Very big contrast to the tercel I once owned (but that's another write-up).  Straight-line acceleration is of course very good with the V6.  I do wish 1st gear were a bit smaller.  Handling is good but the standard equipment tires are pathetic.  I am counting the miles until I can justify replacing them.  The breaks.  The breaks are outstanding.  Deliciously thick rotors, not at all like that Saturn which could warp on a dime (again, though, another write-up).  And body integrity.  No wind noise or rattles as of yet (not that such would be so horrible).  Very stiff frame.  This car feels quite heavy.  Both a good and bad thing, I suppose.  Mostly good.  All indications are that this vehicle is exceptionally safe.  I have named mine the Piggy Tank.  

     When I read these sorts of reviews, I'm always interested to see long-term experiences--so I hope other GTI owners will make periodic reports.  I will try to give a little summary every six months or so, if that would be welcome.  Volkswagons generally mean much more to their owners than can be put in a few paragraphs.  As for me, I think my own quest for a long-term car is finally at an end.    <br><br>
