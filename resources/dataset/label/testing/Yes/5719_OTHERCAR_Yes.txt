            I have been driving a Camry Solara for the past couple of weeks as a rental car, since my 17-year-old son has just had his 3rd accident in the 17 months since he received his license. Since this is the review of the Solara and not my son&#146s (so called) driving skills, let&#146s just move on ...

The Solara is intended to be the coupe version of Toyota&#146s best selling sedan, the Camry. There have been Camry coupes in the past, that were simply known as the ... drum roll please ... the Camry coupe. Why Toyota decided to add the Solara name to this latest incarnation is beyond me; then again, I don&#146t have a degree in marketing.

The Solara I am driving in champagne (light gold) in color with tan cloth seats. It is, I believe, a base model, which means it has the same 2.4-liter, 4-cylinder engine as the Camry sedan, coupled to a 4 speed automatic transmission. Power locks, mirrors, windows, cruise control, alloy wheels, tilt steering and a combination CD/Cassette stereo with 6 JBL speakers complete the equipment level. There is an available V6 engine, available in the SE and SLE models, which I am sure have even more goodies designed to coddle both driver and passenger alike.

First impressions were not too bad. The overall lines of the car are pleasing to the eye, with a nice balance between the front and rear of the car. The only real problem I have is with the standard 14&#148 alloy wheels and tires. Simply put, they look wimpy in the wheel wells. I believe that the V6 versions of the Solara have 15&#148 or 16&#148 wheels and tires, and I&#146m certain that they would look much better.

Inside is a bit better, save for the &#147plood&#148 (plastic wood) that adorns the dash and door trim. I&#146ve never been a fan of Toyota&#146s interior design &#150 I know it is a personal opinion, but they have always seemed a bit pedestrian to me. There is nothing that really excites the senses. Now, that isn&#146t to say that the interior isn&#146t functional &#150 it is. Everything falls readily to hand, the stereo controls (AM/FM cassette with single CD player) are easy to manipulate and the instrumentation is easy to read. It all looks so ... boring, I guess is the word I would use. No sensuous shapes. It is as if the designers had their soul taken out before designing the interior. 

One major gripe I have with the interior is the lack of adjustable front seat belts. I guess I&#146ve gotten so spoiled by this feature that I forget that not every car has it. Instead, Toyota uses this plastic extension to allow the driver and passenger to reach the seatbelt. Sort of kludgey, in my opinion. I have not sampled the rear seat, but being a coupe with swoopy styling, I would imagine rear seat headroom to suffer just a bit because of it.  The trunk, while decently shaped, is a bit shallow and has a high lip to clear.

My parents have owned three Toyotas over the years (a &#14673 Corona, an &#14685 Celica and a &#14691 Camry), and all three of them were solid, well built cars. The Solara I have been driving is no exception. The engine is very quiet for a 4 cylinder; in fact, when I first got behind the wheel, I thought it was a V6. There is smooth delivery of power, with a transmission that seems to be perfectly matched to the characteristics of the engine. Again, I only have one complaint, albeit a small one. Toyota insists that to downshift the transmission from 4th to 3rd, you use a button on the side of the transmission lever instead of having an extra slot to move the transmission to. It&#146s not hard to learn how to use this, but it seems a bit awkward to me.

The suspension does an adequate job of holding the car to the road; as I get older, I find that my boy racer tendencies are starting to desert me. That, plus most of my driving is done on urban area interstate highways, which are heavily patrolled in some places and grid locked in others. The combination of the two does not give one a chance to explore the handling boundaries of a car. I will admit that the ride is quite smooth, with little road noise transmitted into the passenger cabin by the tires, and little wind noise from the windshield and frameless side windows.

Overall, I don&#146t think this is a bad effort by Toyota. For people who are looking for something slightly different than a 4-door sedan, the Solara is something that they should take a closer look at. The racier styling offsets the diminished utility of 2 fewer doors and a smaller trunk. However, don&#146t confuse the Solara with a sporty car, as disappointment will abound. If the Solara were a student, it would be a solid B, maybe a B+ student.
