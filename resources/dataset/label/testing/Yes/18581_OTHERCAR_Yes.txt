            A wonderful way to travel indeed. We have owned one for six years, the vehicle has travelled 113,000 miles around Europe without faltering.

We bought this vehicle as a practical family saloon. We have 2 children now aged 4 and 5. The boot is big enough to throw bicycles, suitcases, and golf bags in without even packing them! 

The safety of this quality vehicle stands out in every way. Long distance driving is a joy. Set the cruise control and enjoy the quiet passage of the countryside. You will arrive refreshed and calm. It is a vehicle that you don't get hot and bothered in, traffic jams become a place of contemplative enjoyment - what's the hurry?

I would always recommend that the vehicle is maintained by an approved dealership. My experience of these has been extremely good. When I bought the vehicle it was delivered to my office with a sheaf of flowers on the back seat for my wife - an excellent start to a good customer relationship that I cannot fault. 

Love the Mercedes-Benz customer golf competition too - They even let me win our local event!<br><br>
