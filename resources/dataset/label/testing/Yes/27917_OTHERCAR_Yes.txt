            In the market for a Lexus LS400? I would definately recommend this car. My family owns two LS400's, one black and one white, both loaded. This car is built very thoroughly with special attention to the interior. Engine noise is unbelievably quiet, even with 40000 miles on it.
Maintenance of the LS400 is non-existent.
The xenon headlamps are very bright.
The exterior styling of the car is up to date and clean.
The interior is well detailed, and the leather seats are supple and very very comfortable.
The brakes are big and more than enough to stop the car in bad situations.
The engine is very powerful, a tap of the gas pedal send the LS400 cruising. Maybe it is a little to powerful.. the suspension is very soft, leading to a lot of movement in turns. But don't let the soft suspension fool you, the ride of the LS400 at 90 MPH is as smooth and quiet as cruising at 65 MPH.
Overall I think the LS400 is well worth it's money. And it also has a great retention value too. Thus if you're looking into the LS400, ponder no more, let the Lexus LS400 be your new ride. <br><br>
