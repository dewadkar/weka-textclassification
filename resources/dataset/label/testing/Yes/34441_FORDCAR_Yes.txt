                                      ADDENDUM 7/12/00

This review was originally in the general used F250 pickup section. Apparently, they've done some category combining, since this is now in the 1999 section. I guess now a vehicle has to be newer than 1987 to be reviewed. So bear in mind that this was NOT put in the wrong category by me, but by Epinions itself during some housecleaning spree.

They just don't build automobiles like they used to, do they? We are the proud owners of a 1965 Ford 250 3/4 ton pickup. It's original color was Ford blue, but now it's a delightful orange rust color. My husband comes from a long line of people that have the annoying habit of naming vehicles. The truck is known as &quot;Old Blue&quot; or &quot;Blue&quot; for short. In keeping with familial tradition, the truck shall be referred to as Blue for the rest of this review.

First, let me establish that this review may be somewhat prejudiced against the truck, because quite simply, this truck hates me. Any other member of the family, or complete strangers, can drive this truck with no problems. However, I cannot drive around the block without something falling off or failing to work. I will try to be fair, and list what everyone else finds so positive about this Stephen King-esque hunk of machinery.

This truck is built to last! Even I can admit that. It's 35 years old and still runs great. The gas mileage is in the tolerable 15-18 mpg range, which is fine with us, since we only use it for hauling large items or as an emergency replacement vehicle if one of our other cars breaks down.

It is built out of <b>metal</b>, not that that flimsy metal car manufactures use now, but some sort of substance that would be at home on a rocket. I've known this truck for 12 years, and in that entire time, the amount of rust has stayed consistent. No more, no less. There are no holes in any of the rusted spots yet. This is unfortunate, because I know that the only way I'll be rid of this demonic entity is when it rusts apart. 

If you open the hood and look inside, you will see large expanses of ground underneath. This is a <i>good</i> thing. It does not mean that you have pieces of engine missing. It means that this truck was built back when the main function of an engine was to make the truck move from point &quot;a&quot; to point &quot;b&quot;. There's room in there to perform engine repair without major contortions. You can change the spark plugs without having to completely remove the engine. And best of all, there is no computer chip anywhere in sight. If something breaks, it's mechanical. Make a quick trip to AutoZone and get a new part and slap that puppy in there. 

The inside is spartan. The only upholstery you'll find is on the seat (and after 35 years, there's darn little on the seat). Every other surface is metal. There's a space for the factory radio, but apparently the truck decided I shouldn't listen to music and spat the radio out one day, leaving a small opening. There's a manual choke which requires much fine tuning in order for me to get the proper amount of fuel to start Blue. Everyone else can just yank the choke out as far as it will go and it will start right up. The heater consists of &quot;on&quot;. And two speeds, &quot;roast&quot; and &quot;broil&quot;. Except when I'm driving, then I can choose from &quot;Rapid Freeze&quot; and &quot;Arctic Blast&quot;. 

This is the most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever driven. After 35 years of use, the seat has a &quot;butt hollow&quot; worn into it by generations of tall, male drivers. As a short, female driver, I find that I keep involuntarily sliding into the butt hollow. This put me somewhere close to the center of the bench seat, and unable to reach the pedals. The seat has two forward positions, &quot;Under the Dash&quot;, and &quot;Back in the Bed&quot;. Neither position fits my needs very adequately. My husband keeps telling me that it's a simple matter to replace the seat with a better one, but so far I've noticed no great ambition on his part to do so. 

When my husband purchased the truck from his father, he immediately set about making some performance improvements. You are about to learn exactly how simple it is to make a 35 year old truck perform using common household items. If you are a stickler for OEM parts, stop reading <b> RIGHT NOW</b> or you will have a seizure . We noticed the ride was rather bouncy, so we decided the shock absorbers probably needed replaced. After purchasing a set, my husband crawled underneath Blue to pull out the old ones. There <i>were</i> no old ones. Pieces of 2X4s had been wedged into the shock absorber homes. Take heed-wood is <b>not</b> a good shock absorber! The hood latch was also replaced, after my husband decided that baling wire was too inconvenient to mess with every time he wanted to open the hood. The seats were covered with seat covers after I objected to the sticky residue left on my rear end from the duct tape used to seal rips and tears. 

We've had this beast from hell for 12 years now, and outside of routine maintenance (and replacing parts that were missing from the outset), very little has been done. Two king pins have been replaced, along with the brakes,which quit working every time I tried to stop. The clutch has held up admirably under my assaults, and is still going strong.

If you're looking for a dependable vehicle that you can work on yourself (if you are so inclined) an ancient vehicle like this can't be beat. Blue is a true workhorse, and with some TLC and a total restoration, the truck could be worth some money as a classic. Understandably, I have not pushed for restoration, preferring to wait for the truck to die a natural death. Which it will probably do when I'm driving it. Alone. Sixty miles from home. I'm sure Blue will do whatever it possibly can to have the last laugh on me. <br><br>
