            I've owned Ford Explorers and Blazers and the 2000 Olds Bravada beats the ride of any of them!

I wanted an SUV that didn't ride like a truck, had a top drawer stereo system, cushy front seats, and power everything. In the 2000 Bravada I found the complete package. If you've driven Explorers, Jimmys, or Blazers, you know the ride you get ... If you've driven a Town Car or a Caddie you know that feeling. With the Bravada you feel like you in a heavy, tight, well-shock-absorbed luxury car.

Olds has done a fine job of including most of the luxury creature comforts in their SUV, from electric seats with two memories to light-sensing rear view mirror, this car is definitely not your father's Oldsmobile.

If your used to Chevy or Ford SUV's, you'll find the Bravada about $2500-3000 more, but with all the things that are standard equipment, it doesn't price out much more than the Chev or Ford with optional equipment.

Olds is currently offering a $2000 factory rebate, which helps, as well.

While there are just two of us, the Bravada can easily seat five. We bought it with the plan in mind to travel widely when I retire. With the Explorer, our backs hurt after a couple of hours. We have driven four hours without stopping, with any discomfort.

Check the Bravada out. It's a luxury car for a mid-sized budget.
