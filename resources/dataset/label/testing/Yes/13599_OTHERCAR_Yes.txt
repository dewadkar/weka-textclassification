                Whether your are 16 or 80 this car is great, it is my fathers car and he is 80 years old and has put over 60,000 miles on it in about a year. This car is all about functionality, you won't find any GPS systems or DVD players aboard this little rocket. Driving this car is very pleasurable, it could use a little more grunt in the power department but the it handles like an indy car, and the shifter is so precise that you dont even have to move your arm to shift it, just a flick of your fingers will move it right into the next gear.

    This car is front engine, rear drive which sets it apart from other small import cars, most of which are front wheel drive. It is powered by a dual over head cam 1.8 liter in-line four which is mated to a flawless 5 speed manual tranny. The engine builds revs very quickly and you can scream right up to 7000 rpm. 

    I said before that the engine is lacking, but if your are reading this right now that means you are on the internet, go to your search engine and type in Miata and you will find thousands of clubs and performance parts for this car. In my opnion the website Flyinmiata.com is one of the best. They offer every thing from car covers to turbo charging systems. 

    Of course if you have a little four cylinder motor cranking out 300 horsepower that is only designed to make 130 it may compromise the reliability. I installed a aftermarket exhaust and intake on my fathers car and it helped alot and also sounds cool.

     Another thing, if you are over six feet tall, like me, getting in and out of this car can be difficult, once you are in it there are no problems though. The seats are nice to sit in, and you can take this car on long trips without getting to uncomfertable, just dont bring a lot of luggage. The convertable top is easy to take down which is nice because you will want to all the time, the cover for when it is down is difficult to put on though and I often just leave it off. The top makes a pretty good seal when its down to, it dose'nt leak when it rains and there is no wind leakage either.

   Overall this is a car that is fun to drive, extremely reliable, affordable and just plain looks awesome. If you dont need to transport people all the time it an extremely easy car to live with and with about 35 mpg a great commuter car. If you are looking for a great car that sits apart from all the cookie cutter econo boxs out there then this is for you.
