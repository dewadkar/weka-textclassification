            The Kodak DC-240 Digital Camera was my first foray into the digital imaging world, and it's been absolutely great! I got mine in April 2000, and have taken over a 1000 pictures with it. While there are a few quirky things I dislike, overall it's a wonderful camera, and I would recommend it to everyone!

First, let me say that the best way to buy this camera is online. I saved over $100 buying it at OnVia.com (which I don't recommend), and you can see similar savings at places like Buy.com. Do some comparison shopping at shopper.com and see for yourself. 

I use my camera is a variety of settings, from outdoor, scenic pictures to indoor, closeups of my newborn daughter. In most cases, with just using the autoexposure feature, the pictures are slightly short of flawless. The colors are absolutely wonderful, they are crisp and sharp...perfect for putting on the web, which I do routinely. The only complaints I have in this area are with some of the outdoor shots. If you are shooting into a bright light source, or one with a lot of reflectivity (like water or snow), you won't get a great image unless you adjust the exposure manually (which is very easy to do). My pictures of the Pebble Beach Golf Course turned out horrible because I was shooting towards the ocean. I had adjusted the exposure to make up for this, but was fooled by the contrast setting on the display, which made the images look OK, eventhough they weren't. The contrast setting for the display is another substandard feature...often you're tricked into thinking a picture looks good because the contrast has been adjusted incorrectly.

Downloading images is a snap with the USB connection, and relatively fast with the serial port connection. As mentioned by another reviewer, buy an AC adapter to do your downloads, or use a seperate device that you can plug your flashcard into. The downloads suck your batteries dry, and noticed that the software hangs often when using the USB connection and downloading on batteries. You can't go wrong spending the $20 for the AC adapter.

Kodak also throws in some software for PC's and MAC's, which is pretty decent. I use Photoshop 5 to make my changes.

The setting I mostly use for my images is the one that's best for web sites. But I've also taken these images and had 4x6, 5x7, and 8x10 pictures made at Shutterfly.com, and pixelization is minimal.

One last thing - try sticking with Kodak's rechargeable batteries. I tried using some from Energizer, and they didn't work as well.

All in all this is an excellent camera. It's appropriate for both the novice camera user, and the more intermediate user. The price makes it very attractive, especially when comparing features with other cameras. I did a lot of shopping around, and this one has met every need I have. Highly recommended!<br><br>
