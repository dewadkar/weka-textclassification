            When we first got married, my husband had a 5 speed truck.  He decided I was going to eventually destroy the clutch, so he started looking at new (automatic) cars.  My husband is a genius when it comes to cars.  Our dates often included trips through several car lots just to look.  
 
I am originally from Indiana and make the trip home about every other month.  On one such occasion, he told me he found the perfect car.  It was a Hyundai.  My father works at Chrysler Transmission, my grandmother retired from General Motors, and my other grandpa buys Fords.  I was raised thinking foreign cars were dirty words.  But, he was my husband, so I came back and we went to the car lot. 

Skeptical me was very impressed.  From the 100,000 mile warranty (which would come in handy with all my travel) to the car itself, I was sold.  We drove our forest green Hyundai home and I called and told my dad about it.  He said we got a great deal.  Chrysler has since formed an alliance with Hyundai. My grandfather, the Ford-man, didn't even mind that it was a foreign car, and said it was pretty sharp.

We have had our car over a year now.  We haven't had it back to the shop for anything but a LOT of oil changes.  We have almost 20,000 miles on it which includes 4 trips to Indiana.  

I highly recommend it to anyone.  It is a great car.<br><br>
