            I currently own a 1998 Toyota Camry CE 4-door sedan.  It has a four-cylinder engine and on good days, it averages 28-30 miles per gallon.  With increasing gasoline prices, the good mileage I get is proving to be invaluable.

This car is the second car I've owned.  The first was straight out of highschool - a 1990 Ford Tempo GXL.  It was a four-cylinder engine, too, but what a difference in the two cars.  The Ford was dying on me as of 60,000 miles and couldn't chug up a hill while the a/c was running.  The Camry seems like it's got twice the power and oomph of the old Tempo and it's a bigger vehicle to boot. How can that be with both cars having four-cylinder engines?  I was told it was in the design of the engines and the horsepower I have in the new car.  However, even though this car definitely has more power than my old Ford Tempo, I think next time, I'll opt to buy the six-cylinder model versus the four.  

I also feel safer in my 45 minute commute to and from work and school in the Camry than I did in my old Tempo.  The car is safe with a steel frame that is sturdy and secure.  It has side-impact beams and a sure grip on the road.  I have driver's side and passenger side airbags that make me feel protected, too.  

Overall, I would rate the Toyota Camry as an excellent value.  I was in the market to purchase a new car and didn't want to spend much over $20,000.  With sales and rebates, I was able to purchase my car for just under $20,000 and have had no maintenance problems to speak of.  The Toyota Camry is recommended to have oil changes done at 5,000 mile intervals.  Other than those regular maintenance trips to the dealer, I have had to incur no extra expenses on my car.  If you're looking for a great value and a safe, reliable car, take a serious look at the Toyota Camry.  A test drive might convince you that you too will get that &quot;feeling!&quot;
