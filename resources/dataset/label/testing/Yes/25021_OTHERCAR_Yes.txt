              We bought this van because we needed more seating than the regular 4 or 5. We needed more trunk space to fit all of our stuff, like bikes, and chairs (which we take to family get-togethers). We needed all that room and luxuary!!! I like that this vehicle is roomy, comfortable, and less expensive than other SUVs. We got our's fully stocked with rear air, and double doors and everything. This van comes in a long and short version. The short version runs for about 15k, while the long version is a couple Ks more expensive. Our 1995 Plymouth Voyager was in the shop acouple of times for the air filter, belt, needed the idle speed fixed becuase of constant stalling. But that was right when the warrenty ran out. After 3 years, when the warrenty is over, it starts going wrong, then you get it fixed, goes wrong again, then it is fine. I dunno?!!?!? This van is great for any family!! Its very nice to drive, except you shouldnt put kids in front passenger seat, or they might suffocate if the air bag goes off. Families should by this vehicle, couples shouldn't. Well, good luck!<br><br>
