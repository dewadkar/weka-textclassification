            Of all the vehicles our family has had in the past 25 years, the PlymouthVoyager is by far the most comfortable, especially for extended road trips.<br>As we travel far and frequently, comfort while travelling weighed heavily <br>in making our decision.  The comfort of the Plymouth Voyager comes<br>from roominess, well-designed seats and good suspension. <br><br> However, comfort was not our only criteria.  Being a thrifty family, we <br>were also concerned about mileage and this mini-van fits the bill.  During <br>our last road trip - a total of over 3,000 miles, we got 28 miles per gallon. <br> With the price of gasoline going up, this was good new.<br><br>The ease of converting the mini-van for extra space in back has really <br>come in handy.  One person alone can remove both the bench seat in <br>the back and the bucket seats in the second row.  This certainly made<br>things easier for us during a move.<br><br>I really enjoy this van, but it does have one drawback.  For those who<br>are vertically challenged, getting into the back seat or the second row<br>of seats can be difficult.<br><br>I would recommend the Plymouth Voyager to those who travel a lot and<br>to those with large families.  I would not recommend this vehicle to people<br>who often have short adults getting in and out of the second row or back<br>seat. <br><br><br><br><br>
