            I purchased a Laser Red 2000 Mustang coupe in July of 2000.  It was a used vehicle, and had 7800mi. on the odometer.  I chose the Mustang because I owned a 1970 Mustang in the '80's - it was my first car - and the new styling reminded me of the unique combination of power and grace found in the first generation of Mustangs.  I have 2 small children (3 & 7) who are absolutely crazy about the car.  My wife also likes the styling, so the car has been pressed into service as a Daycare hauler and part-time sports car.  The kids welcome the small back seat.  The car seats fit well, and I do not find it anymore difficult to secure their seats in the 2-door Mustang than in any other 4-door sedan.  However, we rely on our Sienna minivan to do the majority of the family trips around town.

The Mustang has an automatic transmission combined with traction control.  I would not buy the car without the antilock and trac system.  I live a snowy climate, and rear-wheel drive is not as good as front-wheel drive in the snow.  Combined with excellent snow tires, the trac control has performed admirably.

The interior materials could stand improvement.  The interior engineering does not feel solid, as the components rattle.  I have had the Ford service team checking a recurrent squeak in my dash every service interval.  They have worked hard on the problem, but the noise is still there.  This does not, however, take away from my overall satisfaction with the car.

And yes, the car is fast (enough for me).
