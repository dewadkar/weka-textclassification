              My family was in need of a car that can handle the snow and yet has enough room for us all...boy did we pick the best one. The Volvo V70 works like a charm. If you want a car that will work well in the snow, I would advice you to buy the AWD model. That's what we did and we haven't been stuck in the snow yet. This car is also great with the animals and the kids. The dog can fit easily in the back cargo area and the kids feel special sitting the the leather seats. This car handles well and is very quite on the road-even when the kids are in the car. The radio and cd player in this car is great. It has great bass and treble. This car is also very safe, like most volvos are. If you have kids this car is for you, but if you don't you might want to buy a different volvo, depending on your needs. The color I have is red and I am proud I chose this color. Over the past year I have logged about 12,000 miles onto the car and I have had no troubles at all. This car is good for me and my family because it has a low maintenance cost, especially since the economy gas works fine. Compared to the older volvos it has less cargo space in the back but is made up for in the leg room in both the front and back seats. The seats are very comfortable, especially with the heated leather seats.<br><br>
