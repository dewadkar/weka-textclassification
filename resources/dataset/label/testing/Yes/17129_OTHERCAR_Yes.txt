            I must say first of all, that I am not a sophisticated camera user, these are just impressions from a normal point and shoot kind of guy.

Design:
The design of this camera is good.  It's not particularly large or small.  It's about the size of your average 35mm point and shoot.  The buttons are all easy to use and there is a toggle dial on the back that is simple and easy to use as well.  The LCD is good enough, but could be bigger and easier to view in bright light.  

Use and features:
I love using this camera.  You can set it to automatic and it operates as a point and shoot.  You also have the option of using this camera in full manual mode.  You can control the shutter speed and most other options such as the white balance etc.  I like it because I can point and shoot for most situations, but I love being able to control the shutter speed for different lighting situations.  There is some lag sometimes when taking pictures.  Sometimes it takes a good amount of time to focus and the focus is not always perfect.  You can also choose effects such as black and white or rich color.  I started taking pictures right out of the box with no problems and just recently have begun to fiddle with the more advanced features.  

You can also take movies with sound.  The movie length is limited and not by the size of your compact flash card.  The resolution is not the best on the movies, so this is more of a fun feature.

The optical zoom is 3.0 X and that is really all that concerns me, you can always reproduce the digital zoom with the software when you want to print.

The menus are reasonably easy to navigate and I figured out most of the features and settings without the manual, so I would say they are easy to learn as well.

So far I've been getting good battery life out of simple AA batteries, I plan to go rechargeable in the near future, but haven't felt the need to yet.

Pictures:
I've had great luck taking some wonderful pictures.  Occasionally the focus is a little shaky, but you can tell from the get go and just retake the shot.  The color balance on this camera is outstanding.  Like other 2 MP cameras, you can print up to 8x10s and they look great.  Having the manual features also allows you to mess around with some cool effects and shots that a regular point and shoot camera couldn't pull off.

Bundle:
The bundle is basically miserable.  You only get some regular batteries and an 8 meg. CF card.  You also get some decent software as well as computer and AV cables.  I will say that I prefer AA batteries because you can always get a good rechargeable set and you never have to worry if you run out of batteries.  Sometimes those proprietary lith-ion batteries can be a real pain to replace, and you're stuck when they're dead, you must recharge.  They need to bump up the CF card a bit and just charge more in the first place.

Accessories:
This camera does have an awesome range of accessories available.  I scuba and the waterproof case will be my first purchase.  I believe it is waterproof up to 100 ft.  You can also purchase additional lens such as telephoto and wide angle which is great for an inexpensive 2.0 megapixel camera.  

Conclusion:
Hey, the price is right.  Plan on spending 50 bucks more for a 128 MB CF card, but other than that you don't need much right out of the box. It takes great pictures (at least as good as my friends Sony or Olympus 2 MP cameras).  You can get a ton of extra features if you want.  Anyone shopping for a 2.0 megapixel camera really go wrong with buying this one.
