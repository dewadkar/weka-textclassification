            The Hyundai Tiburon is a head-turner, pure and simple.  I have never driven a car that has garnered so much attention while I am in it.  I consistently catch gawkers and rubberneckers checking this car out as I pass by. The sleek styling and Porschesque compactness earn this auto high points on the looks side.  
But how about performance?  While it might not pack the horsepower wallop of a Ferrari, the FX model does come in with a nice 140 horses under the hood.  Quick enough for any highway, but it won't win you any top-fuel funny car races.  The car corners like a dream, and the bucket seats cradle your fanny like the old recliner in the living room.  
The only drawback of the Tiburon is also it's most valuable commodity: Its size.  I am a short man(5'9''), and I bump my head on the ceiling sometimes.  Anyone over 6 foot might as well start looking for a convertible model.  My taller friends have a hard time riding with me in the car.  And if you have a family, forget about it.  This car, evne though it is a hatchback, has virtually no back seat.  You can fit rather large things in the back, as long as they are not very tall, but be honest:  Are you really looking to haul stuff in a car that looks like one of Wilt Chamberlain's shoes?
Final Verdict:  If you are single, 5'11'' or shorter, and love to make an impression with your car, this is the one.  I love it, but I just got married and inherited a child, and this car is on the selling block.   Probably the best aspect of the car is the 100,000 mile warranty.  Hyundai stands behind it's autos, and so far, I haven't had to use the warranty.  I am at 30,000 miles, and not one problem yet (knock on wood).<br><br>
