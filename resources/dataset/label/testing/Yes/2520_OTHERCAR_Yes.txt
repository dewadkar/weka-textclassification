            I love this car.  Its fast, turns heads and is supported by Dodge for aftermarket parts.  Stage 2 is coming out 02/04 and will bring this car up to 280hp from the 230 that it is listed.  Expect this to be higher as while dodge claims the 2004 SRT-4 to be 230hp it dynos out at 250 .

Steering is quite precise, though it does seem to track a little.  Gas mileage is quite good, though if you are not used to driving compact car, you will feel like you are filling up constantly.  The good news is though, you can make up anytime that you lost in a hurry.

Viper inspired seats keep you planted even in the worst corners.  The soundsystem is quite good.  There are 6.5in speakers in the front doors that handle most of the bass, and in some songs you will swear you have a subwoofer.

The interior is quite bland, other then the turbo boost gauge and the front seats, it is a stock neon.

But just grab onto the shifter, and all your complaints melt away.  The transmission is an upgrade to the normal 5 speed, and is much better then ever the one that can be put into the PT-cruiser turbo.  The feel of it is much nicer.  Though the shifts are quite long.  Dodge has a kit for this or Perrin Performance also makes an excellent kit.

If you are looking for parts www.turboneonstore.com is by far the best.  There are alot of performance parts out there for this car already, and more are in development.

Stock, you will be trailing a EVO-8, put an exhaust kit (stock - 2.25 inch - with no muffler just a resonator) and a blow off valve and you will then be neck and neck with a WRX.  Spend around 1400 and you are beating the last generation comaro's.

All in all a good car, bang for the buck there is no other car to consider.

I thought about a WRX, and it would be REALLY nice to have the traction in the cold Canadian winter, but the problem with them, is that the parts for the WRX are expensive.  I have had friends that have had to sell them after their warranty came up because of the price to keep them up.

With the SRT-4 being 7000 less, you can beat a car that is not only beating the WRX but the STI as well.
