            We recently purchased an Oldsmobile Intrigue.  So far we've had it for about 7 months.  Here's a little background of why we chose this car:  

We originally purchased a brand new Toyota Camry.  Although it lacked real power, we did love the car.  Unfortunately, (after having the car for only 2 months) my wife was reared ended which totalled the car.  The good thing is that she was not hurt.  We both felt that the size of that car aided in saving her from any injuries

anyway, we saw the Intrigue, and saw that it had 0.9% financing.  We liked the style at first, which drew us to the car even more.  

Here's My opinion:

The car is Great.  We got the fully loaded GL model w/ power everything, and leather, even a spoiler.  We really like the car.  The first thing you notice is the aggressive styling.  LOve it.  Next, is the POWER.  Wow, this car is a rocket.  I did my research and found out the the 3.5 liter engine was designed by the Cadillac division and modeled after the Northstar V8.  It is very smooth, and with 215 horses under the hood, it is fast!  Also, I found that the Steering mech. is designed from the mechanisms in the Corvette.  Put it all together and you get a very well functioning and handing car.  Very stable and agile enough.  

Fit and finish is also good.  Interior is better than I expected for an American car.  Although this car is similar to the Pontiac Grand Prix, I like the way this one looks more (inside and out).  It's got a touch of class to it.  

The only thing that I don't like is that the passenger seat in our car is not power, it's manual.  Not a huge deal, but for a $23,000 car with power everything, the least they can do is through in the power seat.  Oh, well, we got over it.  Actually the seat adjusts way faster than the power seats anyway.  

In conclusion, 

Love the car, great power, classy fit and finish.  Powerful and smooth V6.
