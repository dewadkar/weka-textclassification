            This digital camera is handy. First of all, it is a SONY product. I love most of the Sony products especially camcorders and digital cameras. This camera is an excellent one for 4X6&#148 photos. I should admit that it is not good for larger prints (8X10&#148 or more). Don&#146t even try this size prints from this camera.  It has a pretty good LCD of 2.5&#148, which is the best among the digital cameras.

All you need to do is insert a formatted 3.5 floppy disk in the disk slot, depress the shutter button until a green dot appears on the screen, and finish by depressing the shutter button completely. We can take pictures in black and white, sepia, and in color within a matter of minutes.

The camera comes with a rechargeable Lithium battery, which allows for around 200 minutes of power. The actual time depends on how many zooms are used, the number of flash shots, and the number of times the camera is turned off and on and few other factors. The camera comes with the battery and battery charger. Since the battery is rechargeable and you got the charger, you need not worry about the battery time most of the time.  A quick charge will take about an hour, but leaving the battery in the charger for two hours is better even after the charge light goes out. This will lengthen the battery power time by about an hour. 

All the pictures were stored in JPG format by default, and they won't take much disk space.  For most shots, a 3.5 disk will hold 25 to 40 JPEG images. It can be adjusted for finer, sharper images. Finer and sharper the images are, more the memory it takes and less the number of photos you can save on a floppy disk. With high resolution on this camera you can store up to 10/15 photos on a floppy disk.


This camera has two operational modes as CAMERA and PLAY.  In the PLAY mode, you can see the pictures in the floppy disk that is present in the camera. You can view the individual photos or the index. You can also do a slideshow where each picture on the diskette is displayed in order, with a time interval between photos.

In the CAMERA mode, you can take pictures.  As mentioned earlier you can take photos in Black & White, Sophia and few other modes.  This is the excellent one to have photos for sending over Emails.
It has a timer where you can be in the picture. After capturing the photos on your floppy disk, you can view them in the camera itself and deleted if you feel a photos is not need. So, you can save what you want in a floppy disk. It is a kind of preview. There's a tripod-mounting hole if you need it in the outdoor or indoor for self-timer option.

It's about .3 to .5 mega pixels. So, don&#146t expect high-resolution photos with each and every detail.

I have bought this camera when we had our daughter and it was extremely useful in taking pictures of her. Being a kid, you have to wait for them to have good pictures. But, with this camera, I can take any number of pictures and edit (delete unnecessary photos) over the camera itself and save what I need.

I can take this camera to my work to take photos and all I need is a couple of floppy disks and any primitive PC will have a slot for floppy disk (as far as I have seen). Compared to other digital cameras like that need USB, memory cards and other stuff, this one is handy.
Floppy disks are not that expensive when compared to memory cards.
