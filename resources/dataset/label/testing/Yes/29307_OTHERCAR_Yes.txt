            The 2000 ss with the full slp add ons will be a car that should go
down in history.Each weekend with permitting weather I race on the
street with several Mustangs and other cars.The 2000 ss gives all
the stock power of a muscle car you would need.The slp exuast
is a great system.I've put different types of exuast on my other
cars but I really don't find any faults with this system.I
invite anyone who wants to see the ss in full race mode to come out
some warm night.Remember this is the first of 2000 and why not
own the best Camaro out there.     <br><br>
