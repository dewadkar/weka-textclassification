            When I first learned that my graduation present was to be a new XTerra, I said &quot;A what?&quot;.  This was back in June when only car buffs knew of it and its upcoming release over the summer.  As I read about the car in brochures and over the internet, and especially as I talked with friends who'd heard of it, I began to get more and more excited about it.  The car is very different from other sport utilities on the market.  It's not like many of the luxury sport utilities that have recently been taking over.  It's for the kind of person who really needs a sport utility, someone into extreme sports (well I'm not exactly into extreme sports, but I ski)who needs to get around with all of their gear.  There are incredible amounts of storage space in this enourmous car (it's way bigger inside than even a grand cherokee)and it drives well in snowy and off road conditions.  
However, the car isn't just full of practical things.  I don't have all of the packages, but with just the power package, you get a cd player, cruise control, power windows, power steering, power locks and a security system.  With one package up, you get both a cd player and a tape player, fog lights, a sun roof and a tow hitch.  
I love my car very much, the only problems I find with it are it's enourmous size (the clearance is very very high and it is a tight squeeze in a garage), the unavailability of leather seats, and the poor gas mileage (though I've heard it's not as bad as jeeps and some other sport utilities).  <br><br>
