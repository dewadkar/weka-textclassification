            Rides like a car, not a truck . . . if you closed your eyes inside, you'd think you were driving a luxury sedan.

Suspension much better than other SUVs I've driven ie. 4Runner and Honda Passport . . . when you hit a bump, no loud rattles or slams in the car as I've felt in other SUV's. . . in the winter, the 4WD is smooth and quiet and bites into the road immediately.  

Engine is also very quiet, although 4.0L not as strong as the V8 model but then again the mileage is much better. . . I generally get about 300 to 350 miles before having to fill up. . . 

Sound system is top of the line. . . you hear the high pitch tones and feel the bass in the speakers. . . 

The on-board computer is a gadget luxury that you'll want in all your vehicles. . . the A/C is a bit slow to cool. . . not much else I can find bad about the car. . . <br><br>
