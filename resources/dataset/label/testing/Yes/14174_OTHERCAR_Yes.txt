            I thought this was the best value for the money and also one of nicer
looking minivans on the market.

So far we love it.  It handles and drives very nicely.  It does have the
3.3 V6, which we've read as recommended by Consumer Reports.

This is a very practical and enjoyable to drive family vehicle.  In the right color (ours is flame red) it does not have the sometimes &quot;geeky&quot; appearance of a minivan, but instead, is sporty looking.

The engine is very peppy with plenty of power and acceleration.  The transmission shifts smoothly and evenly.  The seats are very firm and comfortable.  Visibility is very good.

Even without the great financing deal of .9% for 60 months with zero down (which Chrysler started and everyone else followed suit with this year) it is better value than most of its counterparts.<br><br>
