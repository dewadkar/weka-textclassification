            This is the FINEST luxury sport coupe in $42K � $75K category. You can�t beat its styling (inside and out), technology, performance, comfort, and size. It is an amazing and satisfying experience to sit in and drive the CLK320 around. I will make any excuse for myself to drive it anywhere....I am a major car enthusiast...and I would always look at this car or others before passing by...now that I own a CLK - I don't bother looking at other cars - at all. This style is classy and will never wear out � it is timeless (never outdated) like all Mercedes 2-doors 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s SLs. My family friend has a 1991 Black Mercedes 560-SEC with over 100K, and it looks and drives like a new car. I have always changed car every 2-3 years, BUT I am definitely going to hold on to this car for long, long time. 

RECOMMEND you get the extended warranty, if you intend to get a CLK. Mercedes parts and service (just to look at a problem) is very expensive.

Strengths:
Exterior: Work of art, timeless classic look, & a head-turner. Alloys and body colored trim are sharp (better than 1998-99.)
Interior: Beautiful design and shapes. Lots of wood � very well placed controls. Enough room for 4 adults. Huge Trunk.
Engine: Powerful V6 that wants to hurl you to 100mph without breaking a sweat. Smooth & responsive transmission.


Weaknesses:
Bose Stereo system is only a touch above average (like all Mercedes cars). My 1997 LEXUS ES300 standard (Pioneer) system is far better in clarity and quality. On all LEXUS whether standard Pioneer or Premium Nakamachi systems has Bass, MIDRANGE, and Treble controls. Mercedes only has the Bass and Treble controls. I wish the CD-changer was in the glove box like my ES300 or the new MB C240/320 series.
