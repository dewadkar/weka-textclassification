            I just leased an Inifinit M45 for three years.  I negotiated the dealer down from the $49k sticker to $42k.  I also got a very good rate on the money-factor on the lease-which equates to about 2.8% interest.  All in all , I put down $2k and I am paying $550, including T and L, a month for a three year lease, plus 15 cents for every mile beyond 36,000 in the three years.

I test drove many cars and found this one at this price to be the best combination of sport, luxury, and value.

My thoughts on the car:

Positives:

(1) The car is very fast.  The 340 horsepower engine takes this car from 0-60 in somewhere between 5.7 and 6.5 seconds, depending on the source.  When you push the accelerator to the floor the torque pushes your head into the headrest and you know you are not driving a 'normal' luxury car.  This is definitely a sports/luxury car.

(2)While many people don't like the looks, I have found people staring at the car in parking lots, asking me what it is, how much it costs, etc.  I got the Diamond Graphite color and it is beautiful.  I am not sure that I liked the M45 that much in any other color, but this one is pretty.  Anyway, the car is unique and gets a lot of interest everywhere I go, which wouldn't have happened had I leased the BMW 540i, which was my other choice, but was $500 more down and $300 more a month.  A funny aside: a valet attendant warned me that I had parked my 'Bentley' in a reserved parking spot.

(3)The car is very comfortable.  Mine is fully loaded and I really like the voice activation, the navigation, the cooled and heated seats, the arm rests.  The ergonomics are well thought out and everything is easy to use.  The cruise control system keeps a set distance between you and the car in front of you, which is really a useful feature. 

(4)The car rides very smoothly on smooth roads.  On good roads and freeways you couldn't ask for a much smoother ride, but the car doesn't handle pot holes and poor roads as well as some others.

(5)Infiniti service.  Infiniti service is renowned for the way they treat their customers, this was another reason I choose the M45 over the BMW.

Negatives:

(1)Sound system.  While most people that have heard it-it has a Bose 220 watt system-think it sounds good, I am less than thrilled.  Admittedly I am something of an audiophile and want more than the average consumer in a car sound system.  The Lexus' Mark Levinson  sound systems are much better, as are the Bose systems in the Q45 and the FX models.  Also, the car was supposed to be XM radio ready and after leasing I found out that it is not.  Only the M's made after May of 2003 are wired for XM. This was a dissapointment.

(2) Handling.  The car is long, heavy, and narrow and doesn't handle twisty roads at high speed the way you would wish-this is the one area I will miss not having the BMW.  The M45 handles pretty well on less demanding roads.

(3) I have read many reviews questioning the styling, so the resale probably will not be so great on the M45, but that doesn't matter to me, since I leased and I got a reasonable residual (55%), which kept my lease payments down.  My car had an MSRP of $49,000 and the residual is $27,000, but I got the car for $42,000, so I am only using $15,000 of the value of the car over three years, hence the low lease payments.
