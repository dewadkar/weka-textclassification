            I really like my Chevy S-10 pickup truck. This is the first truck I have owned. I have had two SUV's and several cars, but always wanted to own a pickup truck. I was able to get a really good deal on this truck, and couldn't pass it up.

This is a sharp looking vehicle. It has nices lines, and smooth curves. Many trucks seem boxy, but the S-10 has a sexy look, and decent aero dynamics.

This is a sport truck, and as such is a bit small. Don't expect to do any serious hauling with this truck, but if your needs run to carrying small loads, the space available is quite sufficient.

The extended cab offers more cargo space, but doesn't help much with passebger space. The fold out "rumble" or jump seat is really only suitable for children. If you have a large family, this truck is not a reasonable choice. But, if you don't need to carry a lot of people with you, this truck is fine.

The S-10 has good gas mileage. I have been getting 26 miles per gallon (highway miles), which is a vast improvement over my lasst car.

Power is not a probrem. This truck accelerates well, and can carry its weight over the long haul. It has a towing capacity well in line with its size.

Overall this is a great truck, and I would recommend it to anyone in need of a small truck.
