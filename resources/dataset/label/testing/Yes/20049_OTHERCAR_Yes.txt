            I bought the Bravada for my wife to have a &quot;truck&quot; again, she missed her pickup but another pickup was not practical for the new baby.
I checked out features for price and the Bravada is packed. We have everything except the un-needed CD changer and the heated seats (we have not needed them in TX and not even during our trip to CT).
For everyday use and short trips you cannot beat the comfort and features included. Being tall 6'4&quot; driving the Bravada from Dallas to Connecticut was a bit cramped in the driver seat, the very adjustable seats were great but I just couldn't get enough leg extension for a full day of driving.
The Seat memory should be a must, it is tied to the keyless lock transmitter so the seat adjusts to the stored location of the two different transmitters when the door is unlocked. Very nice!
The Bose sound system is a must; compared to the base stereo which is in my Intrigue the clarity is well worth it.
The engine is adequate although I wouldn't quite call it enough power/torque for the vehicle. I changed to a K&amp;N air filter, which helped some.
We had some trouble with the transfer case causing a shudder and really poor gas mileage. Both were fixed with a warranty covered fluid change to a new type of transfer case fluid. The mileage is now around 16.7 MPG (best was 17.2 on the trip). That is well within the range of the stated fuel economy but lower than I would prefer. We had a defective sunroof that was replaced also under warranty.
If you are near Dallas Sewell Village Oldsmobile is well worth a visit, no haggling, intelligent sales personnel and finance department. The Service Department is also excellent.<br><br>
