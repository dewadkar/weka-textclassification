            We own a 1998 Chevy Blazer.  We bought the truck new in the late fall of 1998 in anticipation of the arrival of our new son.  We had a two door Ford Bronco at the time and knew we wanted another sport utility but one that was more &quot;family friendly&quot;.  After rebates and using a cash award system from our GM credit card we knocked almost $5,000 off the sticker price!  We have had the Blazer for almost two years now and are quite &quot;spoiled&quot; by it.  Neither one of us likes having to drive our other truck.
The Blazers handles the New York winters very well.  We had to take it in this past winter because a service light came on and the truck was acting sluggish.  The dealer said that the transmission fluid was empty. We don't know if the hose came loose during normal driving or if we hit something or even if it was not properly installed at the factory.  However, the dealer has always given us very good service for oil changes, etc. and this repair was covered under warranty.
We were surprised when we read the manual about installing a child seat in the back that, you can not install it in the center of the back seat where experts say is the safest place for a child in case of a side collision.  The manual says that the center belt is not designed for use on a child seat so we installed the seat behind the passenger's side seat.
The tinted windows in the back have been great for the baby as well as insuring privacy of any possessions we may have in the very back.<br><br>
