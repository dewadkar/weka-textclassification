            Even though it is not the best car on the market, it is a nice little car for the supersaver.  Having the same characteristics of the Ford Escort, the '97 Mercury Tracer comes with almost everything you need for a decent price.  

Some features included in my car were automatic windows and locks, power-steering, and automatic transmission for only $8,000.00.  The only feature that I would have liked was cruise control, but it is not absolutely necessary for the college student.  It is my first car and I like what I have bought.  

However, there are some things that I could go without.  One thing that many people seem to mention that I have noticed is that it does seem to give a soft rattling or buzzing noise from the engine.  Another thing is that the gas pedal very sensitive.  I find the car jerking many times when starting from a complete stop.  In the winter, the rear wheel drive makes the tires spin a little, but this can be helped by putting some sand in the trunk.  

Overall, I think this car is a good car to buy used for those who do not want to spend a lot of money and plan to buy a new car in four to five years.<br><br>
