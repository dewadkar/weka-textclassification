            First things first...if you need a safe car, buy a Subaru. I had the unique experience of watching one do a flip onto its back at 60MPH down a 20-foot embankment after the driver fell asleep. The only occupants (the driver and her dog) were scratched and understandably shaken up, but suffered no major injuries. The car itself was a total loss. Given the damage to the car, I'm amazed that the woman was able to walk away from the crash. That's a testimony to the skill of the Subaru engineers; the safety systems performed exactly as they should have, and as far as I'm concerned the car saved the woman's life.

Having driven an Outback for several months, I can say that it's a very capable car, but not very exciting (I transitioned from an old Honda Accord, which was a blast to drive). On the other hand, it's a station wagon; it's not supposed to be exciting. The car handles predictably, and the full-time all-wheel drive has come in handy during the winter. The engine leaves something to be desired, but there are rumors of a more powerful 6-cylinder engine to supplement the 165HP four-cylinder engine in the outback today. Additionally, the current engine has been reworked to provide more torque during normal driving, so the most recent Outbacks have better acceleration (more &quot;pep&quot;) than the '97 that I drove.

As a cargo-hauler the Outback proves extremely versatile. The Outback has at least as much usable cargo room as a Jeep Grand Cherokee, both with seats up and down. There is plenty of room for bicycles, televisions, etc - anything smaller than a refrigerator will fit. Subaru provides a power outlet in the back, which is a handy addition for tailgate parties.

The Outback is also surprisingly comfortable. I'm on the tall side (6'4&quot;) and I didn't have a problem with the ergonomics, even during several cross-country trips. The back seat is too small for me, but that's true of anything this side of a Winnebago. My biggest gripe about the Outback's interior is the cup holder in front. It pops out of the center console and gets in the way of the radio, heating controls, and just about everything else. Once you're done with it, it will NOT pop back into hiding the way it's supposed to. I'm baffled that a car that is otherwise very well-designed could have such an awful cupholder.

As I mentioned earlier, the Outback wagon isn't a performance car. I drove a manual transmission, and the top 3 gears seemed awfully close together and short; on the other hand, the car didn't have enough power to handle longer gears. Hopefully this will change with the advent of the 220HP 6-cylinder engine that's rumored to be a part of the 2001 lineup. Coupled with the AWD, the short gearing led to less-than-stellar fuel economy - around 25MPG on the highway. My Honda, which had a similar engine but no AWD or extra weight, ran 30MPG even at 80MPH. However, 25MPG is much better than the &lt;20MPG that an Explorer or Blazer would be lucky to see.

SUMMARY:
This car is great for what it is: a sure-footed, safe grocery-getter. It's not a sports car, nor is it particularly suited for off-road use (no SUV is). It's great for families, twentysomethings, and just about anyone else who needs a cargo-hauler but doesn't want one of the massive SUVs that crowd today's roads. Plus, if you're ever in an accident while driving an Outback you'll probably walk away.<br><br>
