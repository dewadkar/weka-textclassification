            This is so far my first and only digital camera.  Compared to others it was very cheap, and since I rarely print out pictures and mostly share them online, I didn't need anything too fancy.

The camera body:
At the time it was one of the smaller affordable cameras out there.  A little chunky, but fits in my small handbags with no problem.  It only takes two batteries so I bought a 4 battery recharger and always have 2 extra batteries ready to go.  It is very lightweight, which is good for carrying around, but sometimes you want a camera to have a little weight so it feels less shaky.  The LCD is very good sized, though difficult to see in bright daylight. It's made of plastic and as a result feels a little fragile at times, though it's gone though a lot since I bought it and come through with only a few scratches.  The lens cover is kind of annoying because it is easy to hit when taking a picture and then it automatically slides shut.  It is also hard to tell if it is open all the way because there is no discernable "click!" when the cover is fully open.  Of course if it is not open all the way, the camera will tell you the lens cover is not open.

Taking pictures:
I immediately took my camera to downtown D.C. to take a variety of pictures in a variety of lighting situations.  It came with a 16MB card which is more than most cameras and I could take more than a roll of film's worth in one outing.  I found it easy to take pictures (just point and shoot).  However if you want to do more advanced things like change flash settings or use the macro setting for close up pics, you have to go through a menu displayed on the LCD which can be a pain at times if you want to do it quickly.  After a while I learned to do this a little faster.  The shutter lag was not bad at all.  I found that it "took" the picture pretty quickly after I pressed the shutter button.  The autofocus feature is very nice and works well.  This camera has 2x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom.  I try to only use the optical zoom since digital zoom is equivalent to just blowing up a picture in Photoshop.  My one big pet peeve about this camera is the time it takes for the LCD display to reappear after you take a picture (about 5 seconds!).  This camera would NOT be good for anyone who wants to take pictures in any kind of rapid succession.

Picture quality:
Downloading the pictures through the USB cable is pretty easy (Windows XP automatically installed the drivers and I could just copy the pictures off of the camera like it was an extra storage drive).  Overall the clarity of the pictures was very good.  Photographs taken in natural light generally turned out very well.  The colors were very bright and true to life.  In indoor lighting, the pictures came out average.  The colors were not as bright and kind of muted.  Fluorescent and dim lighting pictures generally turned out pretty awful and dark.  I am an Adobe Photoshop junkie and I like to adjust the colors, brightness, and contrast in the Photoshop program.  After doing this, all my pictures looked generally very good.  So if you don't mind playing with an image editing program, you can get the pictures to look quite decent.

I don't print my photos, so I can't really comment on how those turn out.
