            My husband and I purchased our Mercury Sable in July of 1995.  It is a 1992 model and currently has over 125,000 miles on it and is still going strong.  The only work we have had to do on this car is replace the brakes and the water pump.  Before this summer hits we are replacing the air conditioner, which just went out last summer.  That's all!  For almost five years of driving this car, which was three years old to begin with, I think that's awesome.  The interior still looks really good, as does the exterior.  My daughter's car seat fits great in the back, and this is a seat that I had a lot of trouble getting to fit in other cars because of it's size.  The trunk is enormous!  I definitely recommend this car to others, especially large families.<br><br>
