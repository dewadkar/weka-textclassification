            My husband and I recently bought a 1998 Kia Sephia.  We bought this car used.  When we looked at the car, one of the things that pulled us to it was the price and the warranty.  Also, the car had very low miles on it.  Another thing was that, i loved the color, but guess that isn't important! lol

This car is great on gas.  Defiantly not a gas guzzler.  And with gas prices these days, that is just what we need.

The back seat is very roomy and spacious.  This is good because I have a 9 month old son.  Also, my husband is very tall and finds this car to be very comfortable.  Also, this car has a huge trunk!  With my son, this is important since I am often dragging a stroller, and his toys and other needs with me when I go places.

The thing I love about the car is how quiet it is!  You turn this car and don't even realize that it is running.  It is a very quiet and smooth ride.

I don't have any dislikes about this car.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this car to anyone!  It is a great car for the price!<br><br>
