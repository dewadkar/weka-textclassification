            F-150 Fact or Fiction? I will be reviewing the Ford F-150 Supercab Lariot 4x4. I bought a Ford because I owned a Ford Ranger for 6 years (106,000 miles) without ever having problems. When I decided to buy a full-size pickup it was a no brainer. The F-150 was not only the best value it was the best selling VEHICLE in the USA, so I figured all of those people can't be wrong. After having the truck for a year now I am still excited to own this truck. There are just so many things I like about this truck, listed below are just a few.
 I drove a Chevy/GMC and a Dodge and they don't even compare. The first thing you would notice is the way everything inside the truck is laid out. Everything is right where it should be on the Ford, and on the other two you seem to have to search for things as simple as the power seat control. When test driving these trucks you will see what I mean. Looking at the interior of this truck compared to the other two is a joke. Chevy/GMC and Dodge seem like they are stuck in the 80's.
 The next feature I like is the computer key. Since there were so many F-150's getting stolen Ford devised a anti-theft key in which the truck cannot be started without it. I know this may not be a great concern for some, but it was for me living in Florida. I use the truck mainly for daily use and pulling my fishing boat. The factory installed towing package is a must if you do alot of towing. I have only had to use 4 wheel drive once on a boat ramp (it was the bank of a lake not even a ramp). The 4 doors are a blessing. Taking 4 people in a truck is not a problem anymore. The back seat flips over to provide a flat surface for you to carry things you dont want in the bed which is very convenient.
 My only regret is not getting the bigger 5.4 engine. The 4.6 engine is great for 2 wheel drives but seems a little under powered at times to haul around the extra weight that comes with the 4x4. I will admit the 4.6 has never had to strain pulling my boat out of the water.
 I drive this truck everyday and it will be able to handle everything you throw at it work or play. FACT!!<br><br>
