            I test drove this car to play devil's advocate. Do I want another truck? How important in 4 wheeling to me? Driving off road is VERY important to me but this is the one car I drove that almost made me get back into a car. This car is fun, Very fun. I smiled throughout the whole test drive. I did stick to a truck and am awaiting delivery on a 2000 Land Rover discovery (see my post on that if it is a possibility for you). My family has always been a BMW family. I know lots of a4, a6 and a8 owners who are now Audi converts so what the hell? I went for a test drive. If I'm going to get a car it is going to be fast. The new M3 is not out and this car is fast. So lets cut to the chase...

First, the car is fast and the quattro is only second to Porsche's AWD in the car category.

Second, the car is fast, very fast. The kind of fast that you look down and say is this KM/HR or MPH/HR?

Third, it handles pretty well but not BMW well. But, BMW's ASC (all season traction) is not the caliber of the quattro gripping in bad weather. You decide.

Fourth, Audi is still compensating for their poor name in the past. This means customer service that goes beyond the call of duty.

Fifth, the warranty is poor in terms of longevity. If you are leasing; perfect, it is designed for you if you are buying and keeping it for more than four years... well don't bother. Ans while were on problems the dealers are not willing to budge on sticker.

All in all with out the new M3 its quite a car but look at the Saab Viggen. My girlfriend has the SE convertible and I love the car. Saabs are simple but they equal simple fun (which is cult like good). IMHO, without a new M3 this is the only competitor in the class.<br><br>
