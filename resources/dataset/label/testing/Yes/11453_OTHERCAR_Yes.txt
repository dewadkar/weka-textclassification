            Anyone in the market for a midsize 4 door sedan?  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a Mercury Sable sedan.  I bought mine used in 1996 (it's a 95 model) with much hesitation.  I really wanted to buy a used Camry of the same model year with about the same mileage.  But for $4 000 less, i opted for the Sable (which by the way was a lot more equipped than the camry).  At 60 000 miles later, not a regret.

The car handles like a sport car and is very dependable and economical to run (32m/imp.gal).  So far, i had a tune-up done on it, replaced front and rear disc brakes (normal wear) and  had a new muffler put on.  I intend to keep it for another 4 or five years.  Oh and by the way, still not a spec of rust on it.

So who says Camrys are number one.  If they really are, they must be some heck of a car because i just can't see how much better it can be than my Mercury Sable.  I think you are paying 4 or 5 thousands more just so you can show your neighbors that you are driving a Camry.  I'd rather have that much more money  in my pocket.<br><br>
