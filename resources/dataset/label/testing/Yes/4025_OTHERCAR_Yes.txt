            We own a 1993 FULL size blazer(now named the Tahoe).  We bought this in 1995 and paid $18,000 for it.  We are very pleased with our purchase.  We now have 120,000 miles on it and we have not had any real problems with it yet.  You can turn very sharply with it and get into pretty tight spots, I have driven a few full size Chevy trucks and they are not able to make as sharp of corners as the Blazer. Great pick up for passing. We get about 15 MPG with it.  Great towing capabilities, we have pulled loaded car trailers and we own an old (heavy) pull behind camper and we have never had any problems with towing. Mine only complaint would be that the front 2 seats are not very comfortable for long trips.  Very roomy for the passengers, even adults in the back seat along with ample storage in the rear.  I feel very safe when driving the blazer, living in the midwest I like being higher up and having the comfort of four wheel drive in the pull of a handle. As a driver the visibility is outstanding with all the large windows I never have a blind spot or a part of the vehicle blocking my view.   We are looking into purchasing a different vehicle and getting rid of our car(too small for our family) and we will defineatly consider another FULL size blazer, or should I say Tahoe.  We are very impressed with it and would recommend to anyone.<br><br>
