            I had a 1994 Honda Accord EX.  I loved this car.  I previously had a Toyota Supra that hit 160,000 miles then started to fall apart.  Partly my fault but that is a different catagory...

This car was blue book valued 18,800 when I got it and I paid 13,300 for it.  The car had been driven back and forth from Jax. Fl. to Panama Beach so the miles that were on it were all highway miles.

From the moment I got this car till the day I traded it in, I loved it.  I never had any trouble with it - well almost never.  But I cried when I handed over the keys.

The only problem I had with this car was the distributor.  Not the cap - the whole thing had to be replaced.  Seems there was a &quot;recall&quot; per say on ones that had trouble with them.  So, if you had trouble with yours, Honda fixed it.  Well guess what... I was 6 months  and 1,000 miles late.  I called around everywhere to all the dealerships in Middle Tennessee area and all the local places.  The local places wanted twice as much money as a dealership.  NO THANKS!  Finally, one of the service managers at one of the dealerships made me a deal.  I paid for one hour of labor, he bought the distributor.  Ok, I could handle that.  I was six months pregnant and not working and my car dying somewhere on the road was the very last thing I needed!  True to his word, one hour later I was on my way.  BUT, other than a battery, this is the only thing that EVER EVER went wrong with this car.

It was an automatic and was fully loaded.  It was a comfortable car as we took it on many trips.  It had a sunroof and I only left it open for a midnight shower ONCE.  Haha

This car was a 4 cylinder and from my Supra, was a nice break on the gas.  It did not hog gas at all.  I could go weeks on one tank.  I never considered this car small until my daughter was born.  All of a sudden the trunk became very small when you have to have a stroller, portacrib, and a few suitcases in the trunk.  Still it worked.  But, the carseat seems awfully big on that back seat.  It just never really fit right.

When we traded this car in, it needed new tires but that was IT.  Someday I may buy an Accord again.  Someday.<br><br>
