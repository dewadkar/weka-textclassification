            we are on our third camry and have never been disappointed. We have one form 1986 and 1992 and they still are in great shape and we just got a brand new 1999 version and we plan to keep that one for a long time as well. They are very safe cars with ABS and airbags. The controls are very easy to use and heats up very fast on those cold winter mornings. The stereo system is excellent and very loud. It holds many stations to memory so you do not need to find them by scanning. If you are a passenger there is a ton of leg room and cup holders in the back seat. It is also so quiet you sometimes can not hear it running. It also gets very good gas mileage.<br><br>
