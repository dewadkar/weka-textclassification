            I bought this car because it had front wheel drive and was a good price.  It gets good mileage (30-35 mpg) is pretty to look at (comes in many pastel colors) had enough room (seats 4 with seatbelts) and has a hatch so shopping for a lot of stuff is no problem, plus the seat folds down for even more shopping room if only 2 people go shopping.  It handles well on mountain roads as well and flat land driving.  I love most everything about it but I hate that my model doesn't have air conditioning.  I recommend this vehicle model for any family with 4 or less persons, especially for those on a budget, with gas prices where they are!<br><br>
