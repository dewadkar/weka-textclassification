            I owned a 1997 Toyota 4runner for seven months.  Unfortunately I had to sell it because my employer offered me a company car and with my wife's car we could not accommodate 3 vehicles in our 2 car garage.

The restyling in 1996 was a huge hit and I have yet to see a better looking sport utility vehicle on the road.

The overall quality of the vehicle was excellent and it road like a dream.

Although somewhat pricey, this vehicle should last for many years and hold it's value as do most SUV's.

My only gripe, it could be a little wider to accommodate full-sized adults.

The perfect suv would  have to be the Toyota 4runner enlarged by 20% - I guess that would be too similar to the Land Cruiser however.

Anyway, sorry I didn't provide much technical jargon if you were looking for it.  Just wanted to share my opinion that this is one hell of a SUV.<br><br>
