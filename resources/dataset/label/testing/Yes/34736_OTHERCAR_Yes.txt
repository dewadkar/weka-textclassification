            My husband and I just acquired a 1997 Volkswagen Passat TDI Wagon.  We had been looking for a larger vehicle since our daughter was born last May, and my husband had been searching for a diesel-powered Volkswagen.  It just happened to pop up from the Auto section of the newspaper one day, and four hours later it was ours!  

This car is beautiful!  It has all the gadgets and gizmos (minus a CD changer) and being diesel powered, we save on fuel!  We filled up the 18 gallon tank two weeks ago, traveled more than 650 miles and still have 4 gallons of fuel left!  This is great during these high priced gas days!  It also has a very stylish look, in which many lower priced wagons lack.

Also of importance to us was room.  We needed to be sure our daughter's rear-facing carseat would fit, and it did with room to spare!  And once she turns forward-facing, there is a tether mount already installed!  And my six year old son doesn't have his feet crammed up on him since there is plenty of legroom!  And last, but certainly not least, is the room in back!  We hit two department stores and one grocery store and had plenty of room for our purchases (in addition to our stroller!).  And the rear area also has an accordion fold cover, so our purchases were kept out of view!

So far, I have yet to find anything I dislike about this vehicle, except maybe for my husband doesn't let me drive it as much as I'd like to!

All in all, I feel that this is a perfect family vehicle.  It has plenty of room, runs like a dream, and has style!  A LONG step from those wood grained side paneled wagons of yesteryear!!<br><br>
