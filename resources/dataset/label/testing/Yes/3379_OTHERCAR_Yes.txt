            I traded in my 2 year old Xterra on one of these in SE trim, and what a difference a real engine makes.  Inside, there is hoards of room front and rear.  The cargo area hold my golf bag, cart, shoes, and much more.  The seats are comfortable, the stereo sounds amazing.  The engine is the jewel to this vehicle.  It can pound this truck down the highway, get you into highway traffic in a hurry, yet purr at 80 mph barely turning 2800 rpms.  On my first tank of gas I got 19 mpg!  On top of all this, I think the truck looks great!  It's understated...not the macho trip of a Durango, yet it is every bit the truck even without a V8 that gets 10 mpg.  I picked this truck up for the small sum of 28K, no sunroof, no leather(the cloth seats look great I think), and not many other options.  The ride is fairly soft, it takes corners very well...rides like a car in most respects, but you can tell this truck can take a beating.  If you're looking for an SUV, trust me, this is the vehicle.
