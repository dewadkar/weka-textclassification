            So easy to use and the floppy disk for storage is so convenient. I love my Mavica and would recommend this product highly.

The picture quality is not quite as good as some of it's competitor's. But this is traded off with the great convenience of storing your pictures on floppy disks. I can't wait until they come out with the model that uses Sony's 100 MB Floppy-size media. I would never even have to change the disk then!

It's also really cool being able to make a 1 minute mpeg video too. Great for emailing to the relatives. 

Go out and buy this camera... You will not be disappointed!<br><br>
