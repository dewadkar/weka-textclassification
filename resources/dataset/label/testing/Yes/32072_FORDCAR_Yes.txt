            We just bought a 1996 Limited, based partly on the opinions on this site...AND THANK YOU SO MUCH!  This truck is like a dream...The styling is sharp (Like a luxury SUV), and the V-8 has the power to pull.  Granted, we have had the truck only a couple of months now, but after a couple of two day trips, our confidence is way high...THIS TRUCK IS AS TIGHT AS NEW, and it has 65,000 miles...

We have a three year old, and practicality reigns...Going from a car to this is awesome, except a few more trips to the gas station...(well worth it to have the towing capabilities of the 8 cylinder)...

The Leather Seats, Heated Mirrors, 6 CD Player, Moonroof, AWD (really cool), etc., I immediately became used to this truck, and can't even imagine living without one now...Never again without a truck for me!  I didn't even know this has an oil cooler, tranny cooler, etc...

I have Goodyears, and feel alot safer with my kid in this than in a car, especially a two-door car like we have...Sure the tire stories are of concern, but most of those were two-wheel drives, and I'm sure there were some older tire/mis-inflated tire, or reckless driving issues too.  Drive it like a truck, respect it for what it is, you'll be OK...  Besides, there really have not been that many accidents for how many of these are on the road...THANK YOU...George Tuominen, Bradley, Il<br><br>
