            I used to own a 1986 300zx turbo- t-tops, 5 speed manual, every option available. I had it a little over 2 years until I lost it to a tree. My father got my 240sx for me as a gift and at first, it did not equal my z. Well, not for the first year at least. My 240 has absolutely no options in it- no power windows, no power mirrors, no power locks, no sunroof, no cruise control, no rear window wiper, no spoiler and worst of all- no air conditioning. Want to know why I still have this car after 4 years? Within the 4 years and 70,000 miles I have owned this car, I have only done 1 major maintenance to this vehicle- I had to change the starter a few months ago. This engine is tough- I got it with 123,000 miles on it and I'm about to hit 190,000 anyday now. No leaks, no noises, no complaints- and all I do is keep up with the necessary time/mileage-maintenance(oil, belts, brakes, etc). Performance-wise? Yeah, it takes about 7 seconds to get to 60mph but I got my 240 up to 135mph and the speedometer only goes to 110mph- I had to ask the guy in the Eclipse turbo I raced(and beat- not off the line tough) how fast we were going. That was the first time I realized what this car could do- 4 cylinders and all stock. Plus it gets pretty good gas mileage- it has about a 16 gallon capacity and one time I drove it until it was completely empty(oops) and my tripmeter read 436 miles(I reset it every fill-up and that was the best I did). That's a little over 27 miles a gallon but I do a lot of highway driving. The 240 also has amazing upgrade potential- forget about Hondas and Toyotas. If you're looking for something to take on those annoying motorcycle-sounding Civics, it'll be a small snack for the Nissan- you will not be disappointed.
