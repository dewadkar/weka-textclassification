            Before I got my Forester, I had a Honda Accord that I didn't think could be topped. But the Forester is even better than the Accord, and most of that is because of the safety features it has.  We live in Maine, and the All Wheel Drive is a real plus--you never know when you'll need it, and when you do, it comes through. With a new baby, we wanted the latest in safety features.<br>When shopping for a new car, I wanted the safety and reliability of an SUV, but I didn't like the size and handling of some we test drove, like the Ford Explorer or the Toyota 4-Runner.  They were too large for me, but the Forester was a great blend of SUV safety, and car handling.  The Forester drives smoothly and quietly, and corners well--In the larger SUV's I had the sensation that the vehicle might roll over if I cornered too fast.<br><br>Inside, the Forester is comfortable, especially in the front seat.  The back seat is average sized for cars in its class, but whenever my husband or I ride in the back with the baby, we pull the front passenger seat all the way up to give us more leg room.   With a car seat and two passengers in the back, it's a bit cramped; I wouldn't recommend this to a family with three kids regularly riding in the back seat.<br><br>The luggage area is technically larger (in cubic feet--including vertical footage) than the related Outback, but the space is &quot;up&quot; and not in floor space.  I would like to have a bit more room there.  But the trunk liner has been great--messy items  like trips to the recycling center are easy to clean up.  Just remove the liner, hose it down, and it's clean.  The liner makes it a bit more difficult to get to the storage under the back, but since we don't use it regularly it hasn't been a problem.<br><br>My complaints are few:Our daughter's car seat does not fit securely in the middle back seat--the seat belt attachment  makes it impossible to fully tighten it.  If you have a child, check for car-seat compatibility  before relying on it.  The only other  thing that is annoying is that the digital odometer doesn't have tenths of a mile unless you push the trip odometer. I've been given directions several times (eg--drive .6 miles), and you can't just look at the odometer--you have to push the trip button.  If that's all there is to complain about, this car is a keeper!<br><br><br>
