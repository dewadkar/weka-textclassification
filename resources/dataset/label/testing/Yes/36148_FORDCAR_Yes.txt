            When I was looking to buy a new car back in the spring, I shopped VERY thoroughly, and what I finally decided on was the Ford Focus. It got very good reviews in every publication that I read, and when I test-drove it it felt immediately comfortable to me. I bought the Sony Edition, which has the Sony XPlod sound system. This sound system is GREAT! I took the car on its first long road trip back in June, and it performed perfectly. The cruise control works really well, and the car just sailed along with no complaints. My only complaint about the Focus is that when I have the driver's seat at a comfortable height for sitting while driving, when I put the sun visor down my view of the road is completely obliterated. And some of my taller friends have complained that even with the passenger seat all the way back, they still don't have enough leg room. Also, the trunk won't accommodate much luggage. This car seems definitely designed for only one person (not a couple who might be traveling with a child or a pet, for example-not enough luggage space). But the Focus IS a compact car, so even though it has the most interior space in its class, it's destined to feel small in some way. This is a great car for a first-time car buyer like me, because the car is a great value for the price. <br><br>
