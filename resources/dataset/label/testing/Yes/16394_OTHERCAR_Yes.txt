            This is it.  The first car I've ever owned.  This is the perfect car for first time drivers.  The car gets great gas mileage, and that's important if you're broke like me.  The little change I get from this review will probably pay my gas money for a week.  Well not really, but the gas mileage is great.  The air conditioner blows chunks of ice.  The 4-cyl engine has a nice kick to it.  The car is just fun to drive.

The people before me really tried to wear this car out.  Its been over a 100,000 miles.  The whole car was full of trash the engine hadn't been properly tuned in God knows how long.  It was just a complete wreck.  I thought to myself &quot;this car is going to probably break me in repairs&quot;.  Except the thing is, after getting a good tune up,  replacing the brakes and putting on a new timing belt, I haven't had a SINGLE problem.  Its been months and not one problem.  So overall its a reliable car.

The inside of the car is nice too.  Like I said the air conditioner is cooold.  My only complaint about it is that its hard to get good air directly on the driver.  Of course you'll feel it in a matter of minutes.  I hardly ever put the setting past one.  The seat are nice and comfy.  All of the buttons for various things like window wipers are located right on the area outside the steering wheel.  It feels cool just pressing the buttons.  The interior isn't full of options and extra's but it gets by.  There are small slots for change.  The side pockets on the doors have alot of room and are great for putting stuff in.  It does have a driver side air-bag, which is good in a little car like this.

Ok now for the bad of the car.  The car is SMALL.  Not very roomy at all.  I've got to do a little dance in order to get past the steering wheel and into the seat.  All my friends that sit in the backseats complain about hitting their head on the back window.  There isn't much leg room for them either.  The trunk is almost non-existent.  But you can lay the back seat down for alot of extra space. 

Speakers?  Where, I can't hear them?  I don't know the exact size of the speakers but I know they are extremely small and sound horrible (since my other choice word was filtered).  But don't all factory speakers?  It does have a tape player, thankfully (at least mine does).  I don't know if they're standard but its better then just radio, like in some cars.

In closing this is a great car.  Its really fun to drive if you have a manual transmission.  Not only did I learn how to drive in this car but I learned how to drive manual.  Believe me if the transmission could last through all I put it through while trying to learn it then its tough.  No problems there.  I would definitely recommend this car to any first time drivers.  Or anybody else for that matter.  I'll give frequent updates on the status of my car here.  So if any problems ever do arise you'll know.
