            The '92 twin turbo dodge stealth..... hmm..lemme think about this car for a second. This has got to be the fastest stock car I have ever driven. Bone stock, it cranks out well over 250hp. That's pretty impressive for a lil' old six cylander. This car is one of the sharpest looking cars also. It's sleek body molding stands out in a crowd of sports cars. It's kinda got a &quot;sunfire&quot; look however this &quot;sunfire&quot; packs on heck of a punch. It's four wheel steering makes it handle like a dream. I've been able to out drive some of the best cars through town. However the four wheel steering does disable once you hit past 35 mph. it still makes it nice. (You should see how easy it is to parralell park one of these beauties.) Another plus about this beauty is that when cruising around town.... once an unexspected mustang/camaro pulls up next to you... you can literally BLOW THE DOORS OFF OF 'EM. Once the twin turbos spool up, it flies!! You'll have those kid rock listening to country bumpkins quivering in thier overalls.. There's no other feeling like knowing that my lil' car can eat those big 'ol four barrel, gas suckin', monsters. And it'll come back for seconds. I would reccomend buying this vehicle only if you; enjoy driving... like speed.. and want to look great cruising around. Basically what I'm tryin' to say is... everyone looks good in this car. I MEAN EVERYONE! It's def. well worth the money spent for it. The only downfall i can honestly say about the twin turbo stealth is... the maintnance on it is absolutely expensive... it cost me about 28 bucks just to replace the thermostat. That's kinda expensive considering my honda was only 7 bucks. You must maintain oil levels in the car too... running the stealth even 1/4 of a qt. low on oil you are doing massive damage to the block and heads. I think it could have a little bit more of a safety threshold. Oh well... if you wanna look pretty stylin' around.. there are some prices to pay. Well.. good luck drivin' around.. I'm sure you'll enjoy this car.
