            The Sony MVC-FD73 is a super camera for the experienced and the novice.  Very easy to use, built in flash, auto focus, multiple &quot;style&quot; setting (portrait mode, blur background mode, distant focus mode, black &amp; white or sepia as well as color, etc.).  This camera will even shoot a very short movie (this movie can only be viewed as a movie on the camera, but displays as multiple frames when viewed on a PC).

I was attracted to this product because of the brand name and the price ($479.00 on sale - regularly $499.00) and the ease of use.

One of the outstanding features of this camera is it's ability to save images to floppy disk.  With the current price for floppy disks, I figure I am spending less than $1.00 for &quot;film&quot; and don't have to wait for developing.  I also did not have to buy a different type of drive for my PC in order to read the storage media (memory sticks, etc. require special drives to read them or the data needs to be transferred to your PC hard drive.  With this system, 4 or 5 floppy disks in your pocket and you have the equivalent of 4 or 5 rolls of film).

Another outstanding feature is the ability to select an e-mail mode for photo's which creates 2 photo's - one standard and one smaller for e-mailing to friends, relatives, etc.<br><br>
