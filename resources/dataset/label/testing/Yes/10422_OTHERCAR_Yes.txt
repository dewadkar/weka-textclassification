            If you want a vehicle that is both stylish and functional, this is the car for you.  Not only does it look great, it also rides like a dream.  Once seated inside the only noise to be heard will be from the superior stereo system or your passengers voices. The stereo controls are conveniently located on the steering wheel.  It has the quietest ride of any car I've ever rode in.  Forget about drivers fatigue also.  The handling is smooth weather on the road or off.  And believe me this SUV can go anywhere your little heart desires. The quality and workmanship makes me proud its American made!

The features I looked for in the Jeep Laredo were this: Red, sunroof, infinity gold stereo system with cd player, electronic keyless entry, alarm system, up-country suspension, fog lights, tow package, tinted windows, V8 4 wheel drive, leather is available.  The V8 engine has all the power you need plus some.  We use it for towing all sorts of things.  The acceleration is fantastic.  Always makes me feel good passing other SUV's going up steep grades.  The anti-lock brakes are rated the best of any SUV.  These are the best brakes on any car I've owned.  This is my dream car. Even if I didn't have a family, I'd buy it!   And by the way, this is  our second Jeep.  First one was a 1990 Cherokee Laredo.  We had it for 7 years and 97,000 miles with not one problem.  We didn't even have to replace the brakes.  We bought both brand new from very nice Jeep dealers.  

We needed a larger vehicle for our three growing boys.  A mini-van was out of the question as was a station wagon: just not our style, too wimpy for us outdoorsy types. None of the other SUV's compared to the Jeep as did not there features.  There is plenty of room for us and all the junk we want to take with us.  Weather  going to the Opera or going fishing, our Jeep Grand Cherokee not only gets us there safely, but also in style.
