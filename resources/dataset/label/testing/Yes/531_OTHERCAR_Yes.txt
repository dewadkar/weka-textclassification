            I researched my purchase of this camera for a very long time, and it is exactly what I wanted.  This camera has more zoom than any of its competitors (38-380mm).  This has made a huge difference for me in my photography.  This is a perfect camera to try to catch things like animals at the zoo when you want a close up, but can't get close yourself.  The manual options on this camera are what you might find on one twice the price, and they aren't that tough to use, if you know what you are doing.  The resolution is good but not great, 4x6 and 5x7 pictures print just like a regular camera, but bigger than that will get some pixels.  One of the most useful options found here and not too many places is the burst mode.  This lets you take pictures at over 2 frames per second for several shots.  This has helped me catch some incredible shots of people, animals, and anything that moves.  Even when not in burst mode, the camera saves pictures very quickly to the smartmedia card.  The 8 meg card that is included is sort of silly unless you don't take many pictures or always have a laptop with you to unload the pictures.  Even though there are several picture quality modes, you will rarely use the lower quality modes unless you put a lot of pictures on the net. That makes the 8 meg card seem sort of small.  I use a 64 meg card, and I can almost fill it up with a day of shooting.  It hold 130ish or 70ish pictures depending on compression at 1600x1200 resolution.  The only downfall of the camera is its macro mode.  Even though it works well, I believe its minimum focal distance is about 10cm, wile the sony macro is about 2 or 3 cm.  This problem can be fixed with a very cheap close up lens set, that will let you get the finest details on flowers, bugs, or anything you can get the camera really close to!  The batteries work well, but with such a long zoom, if you you go in and out a lot, or use the screen on the back to frame your shots instead of the viewfinder, then I would tell you to always have backups with you.  One more feature that this camera has over many others is the video mode.  It takes videos at 15 frames per second in quicktime format.  This camera allows you to get video and sound at the same time, unlike some others.  The microphone is very receptive, but that includes the noise of the zoom lens.  Even with the feedback from the lens, being able to switch over to full video with the flick of a switch is very useful.
