                 As soon as I saw the Firebird Trans Am on the lot I made a u-turn and went back, I just had to drive this car.  The Firebird restyled for 1998 is a guaranteed head turner and it turned my head pronto. 
    The car is gorgeous inside &amp; out, the new body style is like nothing in it's class. The new style Firebird looks fast and mean and it is all of that.  
     When I sat in the driver's seat I knew I was going to drive the Bird home. It was like I bonded instantly with the 1998 Firebird TA.  Driving it was even better, power on top of handling and precision, not to mention the car stopped on a dime,(ABS brakes, of course).  
     Safety was considered for not only driver but passenger, there are dual air bags.  The price was cool, $28,000 and some change, alot less than some other &quot;sports cars&quot; that offered less in Nov. of 1997 when I bought it.  
     It had all the options I could think of and most of them were not options but came standard (although I can't remember which). The car had t-tops, which you can get on &amp; off in 2 minutes or less and lock on the car and in the trunk.  
     Also leather interior, power seats, windows, mirrors, like power everything.  The monsoon stereo system w/10 speakers, graphic equalizer, 13 disk cd changer in trunk, cassette deck, am/fm radio. 
     The engine is awesome LS1 and 280 Horses stock from the factory, was told this is small corvette engine, not sure about that but, it does 110 mph in a heartbeat with no shaking, straining, complaining and room to spare.  I loved it and it went home with me that day.  
    As time went on, I felt that interior fittings need to be improved, ashtray way too small and in way of auto trans shifter.  I loved the dashboard, glowing orange at night, you can see really see everything.  
    I felt that some small things needed more attention, glove compartment seemed flimsy, middle console compartment was bent with barely any pressure, shift knob fell off.  Pontiac however did replace or fix any and all complaints and problems.  
    Monsoon stereo speakers should be upgraded as I blew them several (three times), dealer replaced them without a problem.  Finally on the fourth occasion, I was told the stereo wasn't designed to be played that loud.  Huh??  Then why does it have the ability to be played at that level in the first place?  
    I also loved 16 inch Z rated tires until I found they needed to be replaced at 20,000 miles and the cost was $250 a tire, yikes!!  I was told go to R rated tires as they were much cheaper and they told me I wouldn't notice any difference.  But I did notice the difference - handling not as good by a long shot. 
    Also I did not like blind spots where side panels in rear blocked view. Then there was the issue of no one wanted to sit in back seat, pretzel city for adults, way small and cramped.  Also when t-tops off no room in trunk for much of anything. 
    I loved driving this car, when I got in my Trans Am if I felt bad I was instantly feeling better.  This car drives like a dream on freeway, around town, where ever!!  The power to get in, out and around any situation was so awesome. 
     The only problem I had was everyone wanted to race, even the police.  I had no problem leaving most cars in the dirt, except a viper, ha-ha.  The Firebird handles great, and the growl of the engine is music to my ears.  I never owned a car that had so many people tell me how beautiful it was, looked at it, did 360 to look at it, stopped me to ask about it, etc, etc.  Everyone seemed to love my car almost as much as I did when I drove it anywhere.
     You should buy this car if you like speed, excitement, fast cars, beautiful cars and a quality product from an American manufacturer.  You should not buy this car if you have children, need lots of space in your trunk, like to go four wheeling or have trouble getting in and out of cars low to the ground. You should not buy this car if you have a bad driving record, I got a ticket for &quot;Exhibition of Speed&quot;, a misdemeanor where I live that cost $275.00, not to mention the insurance price hike. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy the thrill of driving again!
