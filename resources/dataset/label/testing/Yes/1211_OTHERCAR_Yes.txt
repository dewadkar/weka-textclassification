            This camera loves to shoot fast and was designed with a sports photographer or photo journalist in mind. 

It's ability to capture high quality fast action shots makes this camera a reliable choice for the person who is looking to break into the pro sports photography arena, the photo journalism field or the already acomplished film pro looking to transition into the digital imaging with ease.

Canon EOS 1-v 35mm SLR users will appreciate the familiarity of this camera as it combines all the features and takes them to the digital level.

Features that made the transition from the 35mm EOS 1-v to the EOS-1D include the same metering modes, variable diopter control, an eyepiece shutter, and 100% viewfinder coverage. The dust and weather resitant magnesium alloy body makes this camera rugged enough for the field photographer capturing the action out in the rough.

The resulting 4.48 megapixel (4.15 effective) images are of sufficient quality and resolution for most pro newspaper & magazine assignments and can be 12-bit Raw files or a choice of JPEG formats. When shooting in Raw format mode you can set the camera to capture JPEG & RAW images simultaneously. This feature allows for fast image transmission and high quality archiving of images with little fuss. 

A particularly neat feature which makes this baby a must have for the pro who shoots multiple assignments is the camera's ability to store multiple subfolders on each compact flash memory card. You can assign a folder to each assignment and then subfolders for each image format. It makes sorting and archiving easy in the field.

The camera has a slot for type I & type II compact flash memory cards and is compatible with current IBM micro drives. This camera is compatible with all canon EF lenses and most EOS system accessories including the EX speedlights. 

Adobe Photoshop LE, a Firewire IEEE 1394 interface for high speed image transfer and both windows & Mac based capture software, makes capturing & tweaking images a snap.  

I could go on and on about more of the features and extras this camera has to offer.. it's a pro level digital camera that performs in the field with the quality you'd expect from a Canon Film camera. The images are crisp clear with  true to life color that is right on. 

Delivering high quality images @ 8 frames per second with a top shutter speed of 1/16,000 of a second and a top x-sync shutter speed of 1/500, is what sold me on this camera.

I love the fast action capturing capability, the compatibility with the other EOS film accessories plus the control this camera allows me to have over my images. For me It has made the transition from film to digital a painless one.
