            I recently bought a 99 TJ with the I-6 engine. I've also had a 94 Cherokee and my first Jeep was a 89 Wrangler. First of all for Jeep enthusiasts, let me just say that this is still a Jeep - good and bad. Compared with my 89 YJ, the 99 is an amazing improvement. The soft-top is a lot easier to put up and take down. The TJ also just drives much better on road. I haven't had a chance to drive it off road yet, but with the optional Trak Lok, I have no fear - Trak Lok is a must if you have any plans to go off roading.

I got my Jeep back in July, and the first thing I did was remove the soft top. Of course that week it rained (not drizzle) - did I mention that I removed the soft top and left it at home? No big deal, I just covered the cloth seats with a plastic grocery bag. When I got home, I just removed the drain plugs and that was that. The Jeep was in the rain for a good 6 hours, and the in dash CD player, steering wheel cruise control and all other electronics were just fine.

I got the 3 speed auto because my wife can't drive a stick, and apparently I can't either because I've replaced the transmission on every manual car I've owned. At first I was concerned about the 3 speed because there is no overdrive. At 65 mph, the engine speed is about 3000 rpm, but according to a friend who is a Jeep race mechanic, that's no problem for the engine.

The bad thing about the new TJ is that it's still a Jeep. Yes it's cute. Yes women flash you on the freeway (really!), and my wife also attracts attention when she drives it topless ( the Jeep). It is whole new generation of Jeep, but it is not a Honda or a Toyota. The fit and finish is much better than 10 years ago, but it is still noisy and rides very rough. I still hate the plastic windows. After only 6 months of ownership in Southern California weather, the windows are scratched pretty bad already, mostly from taking it on and off and storing it.

By the way the new soft top is great but the back plastic window really sucks - it's a real hassle to put back on.

All in all I would never drive anything else. But order the vinyl seats and definitely the 6 cylinders.
