            My husband and I decided to get a pickup truck to carry our motorcycles, for use around the house (hauling stuff to the dump, trips to HomeDepot) and as a wet-weather vehicle for him. We'd been thinking about getting a slightly used truck, but saw a great deal in the paper for the Dodge Ram 1500 we ended up buying.

The Quadcab seats 6 people -- 4 people reasonably comfortably for an hour or two, 3 people reasonably comfortably for longer. The back doors open in reverse (suicide doors), but provide ample room for people to enter the back seat. The back seat isn't huge, but it's ok for kids, or for adults for an hour or two (combination of very upright seats and not a lot of legroom). It's easy to flip the back seat up for storage. It's hard to fit a third person in the front seat, at least with a manual transmission, cuz knees get in the way of the shifter.

The truck has sufficient power to carry 4 people and 4 motorcycles (2 in the bed, 2 on a trailer) without enormous effort. The first time we pulled a trailer with the truck, we used the trailer knob on the bumper, which resulted in the bumper tilting down. We brought it back to the dealer, who tightened the bumper back to normal. Then we bought a Class 3 hitch, which is working much better.

The controls are easy to use, although I don't care for the slider on the heater vents -- it doesn't slide very easily, and it's quite a reach from the drivers seat (at least for me, at 5'7&quot;). Manual transmission works fine -- in the wet it's very easy to slip the tires in first due to the amount of torque.

I wish the truck had a tach -- there's a shift light under the fuel gauge that comes on at what seems like unpredictable intervals (supposedly suggests shifting points for optimal gas mileage).   It gets annoying very quickly, and at this point, I ignore it totally.<br><br>
