            Well, anyone who wants a reliable car and would like to save some money.... this car is a GREAT choice! The body is a cute and sporty at the same time, the interior is generally a nice color and fabric, the stereo system is pretty good, and all the electronics and such seem to be working fine so far!

I have had this car for 6 months now and i've only taken it to a shop once when i first bought the car (which had 92,000 miles on it at the time), that was to get a leak checked out, and to get a full inspection.

This car handles quite well in the winter. Just take your time and this car will get you around to just about everywhere! I've driven it on iced over roads, rained on roads, dry roads, and even during a blizzard!

If there are parents out there who want to help their children find a safe, reliable, cute, and fun first car.... this Saturn is definitely a good option!!

Also, I found that my cars seat belts are VERY good!! during the winter there were a few times when i was in a bit of a rush and took a turn too fast and the car swerved a little, and the seat belt held me very firmly and well. :)

If you or anyone you know is in the market to get another car, check out this adorable, and generous car!! ;)
