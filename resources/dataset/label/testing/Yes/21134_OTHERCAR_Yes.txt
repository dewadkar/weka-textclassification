            I had originally bought the Sony DSC-S70 but after a week and a half of use and a little more research I decided to exchange it for the DSC-F505V.  Don't get me wrong, the S70 is an excellent camera, I just wanted a little upgrade and a few more features that the F505V offered.

The F505V has an AWESOME design.  You'll definitely get a lot of oohs and ahhs from your friends when you pull this baby out.  You'll really impress them when you show them the pictures that you captured with it.  Unbelievable picture quality.  I was more than impressed when I received my prints.  They came out beautiful.

Here are some of the great features the F505V has to offer: 

1. Beautiful pictures.  Vivid Colors.  Sharp images.  Can't say enough really.

2. Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar Optical 5x zoom lens.  Gorgeous!  Carl Zeiss optics are the best in the business!

3. Rotating lens body.  Another reason I traded in my S70.  This really helps when you are in need of taking a photo at an awkward angle!  Like ground shots or over a crowd of heads. :)

4. Manual Focus, Macro, and a superior White Balance setting

5. Lithium Ion Battery.  (I hate having to purchase AAA's or AA's)

6. effective 2.6 MegaPixels with interpolation (before compression) to 3.7

7. MPEG movies (with sound! as opposed to Nikon 990)

8. Good selection of program modes: Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Night, Spot etc. 

9. USB Connectivity

10.  52mm lens thread! Rarely talked about but this makes it really easy to find attachment lenses and filters.

11.  That design is awesome!  Looks so futuristic! Nice LCD too.


Ok, now for some of the cons of this camera:

1. No viewfinder
2. Not a true 3.3 MegaPixel Cam (effective 2.6)
3. Comes with a pathetic 8mb memory stick (64MB mem stick is a must!)
4. Battery Life is not as long as S70's


So there you have it.  I have had my Sony Cybershot F505V for about a month now and I'm absolutely loving it.  And because it's so small and light I take it everywhere I go.

The settings and controls on this cam take a little getting used to (as with most manual cams I assume).  But if you decide to purchase this cam take the time to learn all the nice features.  After seeing the kinds of pics you can take you won't regret it.

I recommend this camera to anyone in love with photography.  It's manual settings and functions allow for some spectacular day and night photos.  If all you are going to use it for is a straight point and shoot cam... save your money.  This camera has too much firepower and is quite pricey.
