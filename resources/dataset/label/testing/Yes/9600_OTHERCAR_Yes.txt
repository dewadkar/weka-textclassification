            This car has to be my favorite new model for 2000.  

  I did not get to test drive it (yet), but I went to the dealer and fell in love with this beauty.  I have always loved Celicas, but this gives the Celica a whole new, nice and streamlined look.  I also heard it runs quite quick, which could be a bad or good thing depending on who you are.  

  My personal favorite is the silver, with a spoiler.  There are many options you can get, with 2 basic models to build on.  With everything I want (which is almost everything) it is a reasonable price at around $22,000.  Take my word for it, if you are looking for a reasonable priced sporty car take a look at this eye stopper, you won't regret it!

In the spring they are coming out with a Spyder convertible version of the car, which looks more like a Porsch than anything else.  I can't wait to see what that 2 seater goes for!<br><br>
