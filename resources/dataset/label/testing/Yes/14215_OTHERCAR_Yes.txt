            I just upgraded to the 2000 model of the G20.  I am very satisfied with the new model.  However, there are a few things that make it less fun to drive than my previous 1994 model.   I seem to feel the road less than the 94 model.  The 94 had quicker pick up at the get go but it is true that the 2000 model sustains better control and power at highway speeds.  I really like the changes to the interior.  It is much plusher with better control visibility in the front of the car.  The rear has undergone a few nice changes as well.  The trunk seems a bit squarer and higher off the ground (means more space for luggage and such).  <br><br>
