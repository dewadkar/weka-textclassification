            I probably spent a week, about an hour a day trying to find the right camera for my needs, and of course everybody's needs vary, but it fit my needs of:

1)Realisitic 5x7 photos
2)Zoom (Somewhat weak though)
3)Autofocus
4)Good pics, indoor and out
5) Easy to use

The Good:
The camera is very easy to use, and the color LCD display's instrunction are very easy to follow and really cool lookinh.  I think i opened the instrunction book 2 times.  It has autofocus which is really good to have, so i got great pics of indoor and outdorr, close up and far away.  If you print them out and look at them inches away it does look blury but within 1ft-2ft away they look perfeclty fine.  The camera produces overall good picture quality.  It's not AMAZING and 100% realistic and you cant tell it was a digital camera, but for a person who takes photo's a lot, not a career of it, but on vacation and traveling it will do just fine.  

Cons- There is zoom but 3x optical is good, but not great, but you can elarge it with the software to make up for it and not lose any quality. Any camera, if they make a digital camera with a zoom of at least 6x optical would be great, and doesn't cost a bundle.  The digital zoom is fair, quality was lost but from 3ft away the picture looked great. Also, i got a memory card, but not the kodak brand and it wont allow me to add borders, so i will have to get a kodak card for that. With a 48mb card on the highest resolution and setting i can fit a whopping 117 photos, and on the lowest 730. Also, as some people say your nose touches the LCD display and you get the oil from you skin the the display, and it can be a hassle to keep wiping it off, but i usually look through the LCD display, not the viewfinder for my pics, so it doesn't happen a lot. The software is fair, i kept my old software, Photomax from Polaroid which is VERY easy to use and has a lot more features. Also, yes the paralles port is slow, but bearable, i'm using my USB port 99.9% of the time and it is very quick.  Finally, there is a 1.5 second picture taking delay, so if you want action pics, you have to have good timing. 

Overall, YES, get the camera.  It is fun to use and will last a very long time.  Great for pictures no larger than 5x7 for them to look realistic, and a simple zoom digital camera for vacation and family events.
