<TEXT>
            I bought a 2000 Cirrus LXi as a replacement for a 1995 Dodge Stratus ES, which was equipped comparably. Just about everything with my Cirrus is first-rate and it is comfortable and easy to drive, with a lot of pep.

But there are a couple of things that I would like to change. For one thing, the fuel pump (or something in the engine compartment) makes a noticeable whining noise at speeds between about 55 mph and 65 mph, although the engine is very quiet at higher or lower speeds.

The other thing I would like to change is the annoying way the transmission drops out of overdrive when I let up on the gas pedal. There is a noticeable deceleration as the transmission changes and the rpm's also drop off sharply. With my previous 1995 Dodge Stratus ES, with the same V6 engine and transmission, there was no detectable deceleration when I let up on the gas pedal in overdrive, just a gradual slowing down as you would expect, as if the car was coasting.

Other than these two things, the car is very reliable and, based on my experience with the Dodge Stratus, I expect it to remain very reliable. <br><br>
