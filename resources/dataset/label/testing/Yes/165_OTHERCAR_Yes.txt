            I love this camera! I got it bundled in with my Dell computer and I use it all the time! I've never been a real camera buff, but I find myself taking pictures all the time, now that I have this camera. It's easy to use and down-right fun to play with! I love being able to look at the pictures immediately on the display screen. The 2X zoom is a great feature, too.

On a more serious note, I use this camera to take pictures to post on my website. I make jewelry and sell it on http://www.TheEarthIsOurMother.com. All of the pictures on that site were taken with my Fuji digital camera and I've been extremely happy with the results.

My camera also came with a copy of Adobe PhotoDeluxe Home Edition software to use for editing the photos. This is great software and makes resizing and touching up the photos very easy.

I love this camera and highly recommend it. A wonderful value for the price!<br><br>
