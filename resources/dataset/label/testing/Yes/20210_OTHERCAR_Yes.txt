            I've had two fords in the past.  I had nothing but problems with both of them.  I got my Malibu about 3 months ago and have fallen in love with it, and chevys.  

It has a quiet running engine, I can't tell whether it is running most of the time.  It has great little extras like plenty of extra cup holders, a huge glove box, and is very spacious.  

It gets good gas mileage about 27 most of the time in town.  It has great get get up and go, I really like that as most of my driving is in town.  As a woman I find every thing about the car to be simple.  There aren't a lot of confusing gadgets.  The stereo is very nice, but I think I'll replace it with a cd player.  One problem is the Chevys have the large faced stereos.  I'll have to get a conversion kit when I do get a new one.

It seems to be a great riding car, especially on long trips.  The passenger seat lies all the way down.  Great for the sleeping traveler like me!  The seats are comfortable and adjust nicely.

I think this would make a good family car.  It has 4 doors and child safety locks, and plenty of trunk space for family outings.  I love my car and would suggest it to anyone.  It is a very moderately priced automobile and have been nothing but satisfied.<br><br>
