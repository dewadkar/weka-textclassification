            I traded in a small sports car for this 94 Turbo Wagon a year and a half ago. I liked the handling and speed of the sports car, but it was too small for me, and not practical for carrying things or more than 2 passengers.

So I opted for the Sports Wagon. It has a 5 cylinder Turbo engine with an Automatic tranny. Leather seats, child seat built in, room for a 3rd seat, all the options.

1st I would add that it is very fast! This thing has a 7 second quarter, faster than many sports cars out there. What I like is, it is not the head snapping fast, but more of a smooth acceleration that is reminiscent of a jet taking off. Sort of just pushes you back in the seat as it goes!

The seats are very wide and comfortable, a lot of head room, and it handles like a dream. You can corner in this car at incredible speeds.

Stock engine has 224 horse with 221 lbs of foot torque in the front end. It has a stock speed of 155 mph! Not bad for a small wagon, eh? I took it on the freeway early Sunday morning once..and buried the odometer at 140. It was still going and never missed a beat. You can get an aftermarket chip that will beef it up to around 170 horse with a speed of around 200 mph.

The car will not really engage the turbo until you hit it, making it a nice easy ride to and from the store. WHen you need the power, it will be there. Not the kind of car you want your teenager in, they will stomp it!

On the highway it runs easy and smooth with a comfortable ride. Stiffer than most luxury cars, but to keep the sportiness, it has to be stiff for handling.

So I have a sports car, a utility vehicle, and a luxury car all in one. Not bad, eh?

I average around 19 mpg in the city, and 29 on the highway. Pretty good for a car that is only 300 lbs lighter than my large SUV 4x4. You FEEL safe in this car.

Now, there are some things that go wrong with this model that seem inherent on almost everyone. The trim for example. It will come off. On the doors outside. Not cheap to have Volvo do it.

The Gear selector switch and the shift selector microswitch go out on almost every one of these. When the Gear selector goes, it is a 80 dollar part, but can make the tranny seem bad as it will not shift out of 2nd gear until you drive around in 3rd for a few miles. Volvo will tell you it is a tranny, and try and sock you 3k for a rebuilt tranny.  Have it checked thoroughly by an independant before spending that much.

The A/C evaporators are notoriously going out as well. And costly. The sound systems have issues as well. Most of these things can be done by a do it your selfe person, but it will cost you some bucks if Volvo does it.

Volvo also has problems admitting when it has a bad string of problems and can be a bear to get them to pay for anything when it breaks, unless you have a very reputable dealer. 

I have had many mechanics tell me they have NEVER seen a tranny on this car go out though, and that is a good thing. I have friends who have in excess of 200k miles on their cars and still nothing major. Still going strong!

This a car for everyone in the family. Mom, Dad, teens..just watch their speed! And is sure to be around for a long time. I was in Australia for 2 months, the wife ran it out of oil almost as the turbo return line was leaking ( a 20 dollar part ), and it did NO dmaage. Whew! I was lucky...(so was she! )

It is fun, classy, well built for the most part..and with 35 cubic feet of cargo, this thing will haul 10 foot planks! Bothe back seats and the front passenger seat fold down, you have 10 feet of storage front to back like that! 

The defroster also heats your rearview, and outside mirrors so they are never fogged. Side window defroster is a beauty in cold areas like mine as well. 

Duo temperature controls so each person can have the heat or cold as they like it without bugging the spouse.

Sports trac tranny for better control in wet or snow. Front wheel drive makes snow driving much better. Heated seats are great in cold areas. 6 function compueter with temp, averge mpg. mph, average speed per tank, and an indicator that drops when the outside temp reaches below 40 to remind you conditions could be icy or slippery. Not to mention many other security features and safety features.

I recommend this car highly. I would buy the Turbo version however, as most people seem to want to convert their non turbo after buying, and it is very expensive to do. Non turbo engines are 2.4 litre, turbo is 2.3...too many changes. Just buy the Turbo. It will also keep it's value higher than the non turbo, and are easier to sell when you want to.
