            As far as sport utilities goes this ain't all that bad of a car.  However you can get all the same features from the Rodeo which has practically the exact same body but runs slightly less.  In fact the only difference between the two is that the passport has just a bit more cargo space.  This SUV does ride quiet but its a bit stiff, both in suspension and steering.  As for looks, the passport in one of the nicest looking SUVs out there.  As far as driving in poor conditions there's not much difference between this SUV and the next.  I strongly suggest that if your fond of the passport take a look at the Rodeo.  You get pretty much the same car and save a buck or two.<br><br>
