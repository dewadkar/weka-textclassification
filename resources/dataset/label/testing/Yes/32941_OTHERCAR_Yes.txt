            First impression was awesome. This really did not "feel" like a minivan. It was smooth, quiet, handled nice, and even had decent power. Quad seating is a MUST for young children. The styling beats that of the Toyota and Honda, but unfortunately style doesn't keep you out of the shop. If you have the means, get the Honda (It is hands down the best minivan). If not get the Grand Caravan. Luckily the Dodge comes with a good warranty and I have a Five Star Dealer nearby. They are more than happy to take care of the little glitches that popped up the first year (airbag light, and ABS light x2, and window motor). I love this van despite of it's minor flaws. I took the family on a  road trip soon after buying it, and it is absolutely the most comfortable road trip I have ever had ( I recommend the DVD player for the young'uns). After eight hours, I wasn't stiff, sore or tired like I have been in past trips. Dodge makes a quality product, it still does not rank up there with the Japanese, but I would take it over the Fords and Chevy's I have had in the past. In addition, you can purchase them at far better prices, with more options and lower financing!
