            WOW....   I was lookin for a truck/Suv, and was extremely dissapointed with a 89 Jimmy, and luck had it that a friend of a friend was selling his truck... and all I can say is lucky me...

It had 33" Goodyear AT's on it, a 4" skyjacker lift on it, and it came with Wet Okole seat covers (which any truck person knows are some of the best.

He had the engine switched up, replacin the F150 302 with a mustang 302, which just adds a little extra OOMPH...  which can really be felt through the first three gears... The speed may not be there, but the tourque certainly is... This thing could DRAG 8 of those lil racing honda civics, forget drag racin those people on the streets... SET UP A WHINCH AND DRAG THEM THE OPPOSITE WAY.

The exterior is beautiful, as even the grill throws a menacing look at the driver infront of you... It truly looks like one of the last real Trucks, as the 2nd generation Ram has left us, and the early 90 Toyotas have changed shape into what there is today.

The interior is roomy too, however I dont have the fortune of a 3rd seat in the front, as it is a manual truck... the seats themselves have an adjustable lumbar support, which is air filled (really cool and comfy!)

Ballsy... thats all I got to say... the only problem I had with it, was when I blew the rear differential.  I had to replace the whole thing... totalled about 800, with a new diff and bearings set from Ford (1 year warranty)... other than that, no problems...  The dual gas tank is a life saver if ya forget to fill up, or if you are a gas gambler, waiting for the price to hit rock bottom.
