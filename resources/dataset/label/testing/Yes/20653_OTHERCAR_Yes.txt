            The Audi A6 offers something no other car in this class offers, an all-wheel-drive sedan which was the most attractive feature.  Once Audi offered a manual transmission in the A6 trim with the 2.7 liter turbo-charged engine (a great performance improvement over their sluggish 2.8), I had found my car - a combination of performance, road manners and build quality which on the surface is incredible.  The Audi A6 2.7t is quick off the line, can muster up incredible oomph! for passing on the highway (in 6th gear no less!) and extremely quiet inside the cabin.  The Bose sound system is tailored for the interior of the car and delivers flawless sound at any volume.

For the first three months the car was flawless and even now five months in, things are still pretty good but not flawless.  The driver's window sticks mid way up and requires a second cycle to get it all the way up; as noted by others, radio stations drift between starts; the information display sometimes goes blank (often just the radio information portion) and the remote for keyless entry will unlock but not lock the car.  It has taken three weeks for my local dealer to work me in for service with no apologies, just excuses.  Audi of America has no interest in dealing with their dealers on customer issues regarding what essentially is a vehicle in the same class as BMW, Lexus, Mercedes Benz or Jaguar.  In spite of the problems, anyone looking for a fun, high quality automobile should not hesitate to consider this Audi.<br><br>
