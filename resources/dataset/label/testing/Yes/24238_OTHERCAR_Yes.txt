            When deciding on which SUV to purchase (which is important, since we live in a ski resort), we looked at them ALL!  The Jimmy caught our eye and a week later we were at the dealer.  It's sleek, sexy design was what we fell in love with.  When we drove it,it was like driving on a cloud.  Very comfortable, smooth and great on winding mountainous roads.

The only drawback we've encountered is the &quot;hump&quot; on the passenger's side by the feet.  It makes way for the engine, yes, but for someone with long legs, it's an awkward fit.  Otherwise the legroom and distance the seat moves back is great!  Even leg and headroom in the back seat!  T

The outer fullsize spare gives it even more of a sporty feel (although looking out the back window is harder, but the large side mirrors compensate for that).

A situation did occur with the disk brakes going, wheel bearings out of line, and shims after the vehicle was only 4 months old.  GMC was great in fixing it, but problems with a 2000 vehicle should NOT occur that quickly!

All around we love it!  The sexiest SUV around!<br><br>
