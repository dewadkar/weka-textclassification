            When my father passed on a 1991 Chevy S-10 I wasn't sure what to think.  I was 16 years old and pretty much happy with just having a vehicle to drive.  What I didn't know, however, was that that 4.3 litre, manual shifting, fuel injected truck could do anything.  I could go off road, I could fly when the traffic light turned green, and I could out maneuver police cars(only twice dad).  I loved that truck so much, that I talked my dad into leasing me a 1999 S-10.  Although more on the luxury side, this truck can haul, burn, and turn just like my 1991 could.  I love Chevy trucks and I will never buy anything else.<br><br>
