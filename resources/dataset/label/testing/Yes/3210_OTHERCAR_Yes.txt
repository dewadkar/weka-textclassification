            I did months of research before I purchased the Sony DSC-S85. In that time frame I noticed a number of different models roll out and researched them all. I actually bought an Olympus and returned it because it was made out of 100% plastic.

For me, the camera that I purchase would be for family and vacation pictures. You know the few events when you will rarely ever use one! I will probably never do the high end gear that you need 4.0 megapixels for. 

I settled on the DCS-S85 for many reasons. First this camera feels like a real camera. It is not made out of all plastic and will not break apart if you bump into something. 

Second, the display on the camera is good size and gives you a clear picture of the item your are photographing. 

Third, you can do full motion video WITH sound. Great feature if you are recording a sporting event or your Crumb Crunchers first steps. 

Fourth, The Carl Zeiss lens the camera comes standard with is rated in the top ten of lens! Once you take a few pictures you will understand what I mean!

The big buying point of all is ease of use. It does not take a rocket scientist to learn even the most advanced features for this camera. I read over the manual and in an hour knew how to use all the features this camera has to offer. 

Last but not least, Accessories. There is nothing you cannot get for this camera. There are a variety of lens you can buy if you need them as well as Sony Memory Sticks and Third Party Memory Sticks. The third party memory sticks offer a huge savings and are just as good as the ones Sony offers. 

Check out all the accessories online and you will see that this camera and its sister camera the DSC-S75 (3 Megapixel) are great investments! 

I recommend one thing, get a 128mb Memory Stick! It holds up to 300 pictures and is enough room for all your photos. I paid $69.99 from Best Buy.

The Sony was priced at $699.99 at several Sony Authorized Retailers which is critical. Yahoo and MSN Shopping advertised this model for well below this price and you take a large risk buying for these companies. One because they are non-authorized dealers and two because many do not sell the camera new in the box with the standard accessories. 

I ended up paying $650.00 at Good Guys.com and when the camera went down to $599.00 they credited me the difference!
