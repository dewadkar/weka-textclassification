            We're a 2-Camry family... my grandmother has had her Camry station wagon since forever, still in great shape and great gas mileage, so we got our first one in 1994.  That one was the sports edition one... it handles wonderfully, has lots of power, and I like the way it looks.  Also, it's so quiet... a good car for coming in late and not waking up the whole family.  It's been six years, and not even the slightest hint of problems yet. 

Our second Camry is from 1997, and it too is incredibly reliable, nice gas mileage, and pleasant looking.  And it's even quieter than the first one!  

The interiors of both cars have lots of room, and huge trunk space.

The best feature, I think, is the heater/air conditioner... it gets to the temperature you want super fast, and doesn't break down!<br><br>
