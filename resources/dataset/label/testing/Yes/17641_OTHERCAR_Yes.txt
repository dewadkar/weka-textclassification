            Well, if you only had a brain you would seriously consider buying this car! I've never seen a car company with as clean a driving record as these guys. 

I read in a consumer report magazine where they rate cars reliability safety etc. on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 oddly enough being the best and 10 being the worst. I looked at cars that were given a 5 or a 6, some even a 9 or 10! (eek! I feel bad for the people who own those cars.) But then I look at these cars that are getting solid 1's (remember, that's the best score.) and I looked at the name of the car &quot;SC Series&quot; and the company that makes them is Saturn. I thought WOW! these cars are almost to good to be true, and even though I already have a car (Toyota Supra Twin Turbo) I decided to investigate just because I love cars.

I found a Saturn dealer near by so I went to see what all of the praise was about. There were two models of SC's the SC-1 and the SC-2 I tested both of the models. They both looked exactly the same which was a little different then your average car but not bad at all, and they both handled good they were basically identical, the SC-2 (high end model) came with a few more options. The innovative third door that these uniquely styled cars possess is actually quite useful, you don't always have to clime over or behind someone's seat to get into the back of what would be a 2 door car if it weren't for imaginations of the designers at Saturn. The only problem was they both felt the same power wise. The SC-2 felt almost the same as the SC-1 and the SC-2 is supposed to be the top model. Also, there was some hesitation during shifting on both models. (automatic) If your willing to spend the extra money for the slight increase in power and some more options then do so but if you just want a safe reliable car opt for the SC-1 and save some cash 

I loved everything else about the cars very much all though I don't have the privilege to see how they hold up in the long run mechanical wise electrical wise that sort of thing, every thing seem very solid.

Well SOLID isn't exactly the right word, because the whole body of the car is made out of recycled material turned into plastic to make a car. This is probably the main reason people have been steering clear of these cars, when in fact they are some of if not the top rated crash tested safest cars on the road to date! so you would not only be making a safe choice with a purchase of this car, you would also be recycling to help make our earth a better place (ha ha! My little joke) 

So if you can set the power issue aside and focus on the safety and reliability that these cars have in spades then this car is a good bet.              <br><br>
