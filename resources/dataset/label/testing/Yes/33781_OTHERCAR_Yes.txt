This review is actually about two things.  It is about The 1990 GEO Prizm.  It is also about the Special Olympics.  Please enjoy!

In 1988 I was married.  I got a job working as a Special Education Teacher aide at a local private school.  I loved my job and had a wonderful time with my students.  The following summer I was offered a teaching position with those wonderful students and I accepted it.  Gladly.  I also totalled my car.

When I went back to work that fall I did not have a car.  My new husband and I were looking to purchase a new car and were not sure what we wanted.  We got by with one car while we searched for a new one.  

I had a group of High School students at the time who were at risk.  I wanted to find a project for them to do that would encourage them with their reading.  One day a boy named Danny came in to me and suggested a project that became a wonderful idea and the students began to work.  Danny came in and told me he wanted to help me find a new car.  Well, my students all began reading about cars.  As a group we visited dealerships.  We read all about the 1990 models.  We studied, drew pictures.  Made up our own car designs and created a wonderful project.  The best part was that the class helped me to decide to buy a 1990 Geo Prizm.  They went with me to the dealership to purchase the car.  Three students even rode on the test drive with me.  

Once my car was purchased, that car was well cared for on campus.  The students in auto shop would take it in and do the oil changes.  They treated it like a baby because they had helped to purchase it.  They also got to ride in it!

That winter we took a group to the Winter Special Olympics.  We had a large bus full of athletes, but we needed an extra car with us for the teachers to make outside runs if needed.  My car was chosen to come along for the ride.  Two boys rode with me to the event.  Thrilled to ride in the chosen car.  

At one point the bus broke down.  My buddy Danny was in the bus when it broke down.  While I left the students with the bus driver and drove to the main lodge with another teacher to get help, Danny went into action.  Very quietly, while the aides and the bus driver were not looking, Danny hotwired the bus!  I was coming back to the bus after calling a tow truck, when I saw the bus coming up the road toward me.  I saw students hanging out the window and heard the words...&quot;There's the car!&quot;.  My students cheered and we all had a good laugh.  

My car did a lot of work that week.  The heater in it was so great that the students all took turns sitting in it on the side lines to heat up their frozen hands.  The windchill at the event was way below zero so we were all very cold.  In the morning when the bus would not warm up for at least an hour my car took only a few minutes.  When the snow hit the front wheel drive on that car got us everywhere we wanted to go.  The only problem with the car was that I could only take three students at a time with me.  I needed it to be a BUS!

My Geo took me to the special olympics for many years after that. Over the years it saw many special olympians sit in its back seat.  Some  cried with joy, some cried in defeat.  Some ate snacks and spilled drinks on its back seat. 

It lasted 10 years and reached 175,000 miles.   Rarely did it have anything wrong with it, just the usual stuff.  

This past year, I stopped working at that school.  My students who chose the car are all grown now and gone off to live their lives. My Geo was at it's end, the transmission went and it would no longer drive.  So, as a tribute to my wonderful car I donated it to the Special Olympics old car drive.  The cars are sold at auction and used for scrap, but all of the money is then used for the Special Olympics.<br><br>
