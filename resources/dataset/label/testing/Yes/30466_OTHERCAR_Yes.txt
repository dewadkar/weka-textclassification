            The one I originally asked for was Green with a light green interior but when I returned to my local Toyota dealership after having no luck with nailing down an appropriate Saturn, I was offered the runt of the litter, a VE Tan Corolla. I took it for a test drive and gosh darn it, this little guy moves!  I decided to buy it. After enduring a little chicanery from my salesman, we sealed the deal for just under  $15,000. 

I haven't been back to the dealership in the year since I bought it. I'm sort of afraid to go back given the tactics employed when I bought the car. But the car has proven its worth. At the one year mark, I hit 20000 miles. I've tried to be faithful with oil changes  and that seems to work fine. No transmission drag, no muss and no fuss. 

I sometimes transport large people in my car and there is limited room in that respect. It's definitely a car for medium sized folks. I got a four door , so it is easy to get in and out. Didn't get the CD Player but I did get a nice Cassette Player. I like having the options.

It's a low-tech VE with automatic transmission-so far, so good. Brakes are decent, the running lights are often useful, in short, it works for me and Might work for you as well. <br><br>
