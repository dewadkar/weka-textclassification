            My 1999 Nissan Altima SE has been everything I thought it would be.  It is most definitely the best car in its class, with a peppy little 150hp engine, enough room for five, and all of the conveniences of a luxury car.  

If reliability, style, convenience, and performance are important to you, do not even consider the Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique, Chevrolet Malibu/Pontiac Grand Am, Chrysler Cirrus/Plymouth Breeze over the Altima.  And although those cars might be a little bit cheaper, the old adage holds true with the Altima - you get what you pay for.  And the Altima is well worth it!

One last thing - for those of you considering the Infiniti G-20...if you want the bells and whistles of an Infiniti but want to save a few thousand dollars, consider an Altima SE with the Leather option, ABS, and a moonroof.  Not only do you get the same basic car, but the Altima adds 10 horses under the hood and you save some money.    <br><br>
