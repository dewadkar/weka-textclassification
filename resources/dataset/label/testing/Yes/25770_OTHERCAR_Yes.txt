            1993 Nissan Altima GXE.  At the time of its arrival it signaled a change for Nissanï¿½s passenger cars and one can see why when they drive one of their Altimas.

The 1993 Nissan Altima GXE (automatic) though not their high-end luxury model, the Altima has enough grace and style to make you think that it is.  From it's conservative exterior features to it's nice and velvety interior, this is definitely a car to check out if you're looking for a reliable, comfortable, and nicely styled car.

The exterior is relatively conservative with a rounded shape similar to the Infiniti Q45.  It's not the type of car that jumps out at you to make a statement, but it's subdued shape and subtle use of curves definitely grabs your attention.  Like that intriguing woman sitting at the end of the bar with the come hither eyes.

The interior is built on the same idea as the exterior, conservative, very simple.  The faux wood grain trim along the dash makes the car seem a tad more upper-end than it really is.  All the appropriate controls are within easy reach, though it's rather unfortunate that the Alitma is cursed with that badly shaped automatic shift that Nissan uses on ALL their cars.

The curved line of the roof allows for some decent room inside.  It's roomy enough for 4 people 5 if you absolutely need to.  If you're of average height sitting in the front is roomy with enough leg room to stretch.  The backseats are comfortable though not entirely roomy if the person in front is in excess of 6'.

The actual fit and finish of the interior materials is pretty good.  The choice of fabric that Nissan chose to use is quite luxurious.  It has somewhat of a satiny feel to it, kind of like a cross between velvet and satin actually.  Really luxurious interior for a car that retails for less than $8,000 these days.

Here comes the fun part, the GXE comes with a 2.4L 4 cylinder that bangs out a decent 150 horsepower.  Though not on par with some of those 200 horsepower sedans, it definitely keeps things interesting.  The automatic has a lack of power through first, however, it's a decent swift kick in the rear once it gets through the gears.  

The car handles very nicely as well, a low amount of body roll, and a decent amount of feedback through the steering wheel, you'll never feel disassociated from the actual driving experience.  However, this IS a passenger car so it still has that feel of &quot;weight&quot;.

All in all, a very good deal, with a good amount of space on the interior, subtle but stylish design, and great handling and a decent engine, this ones a keeper.
