            I test drove a AM General hummer because it is a unique vehicle with great off road capibilities. I like it because it has four wheel independent suspention, CTIS, 16 inches of  ground clearence, 37 inch tires, 86.5 inches wide, 37.5deg departure angle, 72deg approach angle, turbo diesel engine, 195 hp, 430 pound feet of tourqe and 9 inches of travel at each wheel. The hummer drives like a tractor trailer with out the trailer. You should buy the vehicle if you like off roading and being looked at like a rich person. You shouldnt buy it if you dont have 80 grand to spare.   <br><br>
