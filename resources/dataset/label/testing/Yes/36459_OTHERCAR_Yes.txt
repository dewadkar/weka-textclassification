            This is the first new car that I have ever bought as I was debating between this car and a 2002 VW Jetta.

EXTERIOR:  This is what drew me to the car in the first place.  The lines are smooth, the front end looks Euro with the large headlights.  The rear tailights give it a unique metallic look.  I opted for the cheaper wheel covers, and have actually gotten several complements on them (even though people think they are aluminum wheels).  The tires are Continental brand.  Not the best rubber you can buy, but I have had no problems with them thus far.  

INTERIOR:  This is where Nissan really cut corners on this car.  The whole dash and console areas are covered with cheap plastics, and over all the fit and finish is not up to par with comparable vehicles of the same price (Camry, Accord).  The instrument panel is based on styling from motorcycles and is easily the coolest feature inside, because it is lit even during the day so its easy to read the gauges.  The stereo is ok.  Its difficult to see the LED display with the sun shining during the day, and I have noticed some skips when I drive over bumps and such.  Poisitives are a super comfy driver and passenger seat.  Even on long trips I find myself never fidgeting in discomfort like I did in my old Honda Accord.  The back seat is amazing.  My 6'3" friend sat in the back and had at least 10 inches of extra leg room.  That was a big selling point for me.  Rear console cupholders also come in handy for long trips as well.

PERFORMANCE:  With a 175 HP 4 cylinder, the Altima is easily the fastest 4 banger on the road and really packs a punch.  I chose to buy a 5 speed manual transmission for the fun factor.  Although shifting is very stiff, this car is simply a joy and begs to be pushed.  In fact, I have even beaten and outperformed a few 6 cylinders on the road.  The handling is great for this size of car, although the turning radius is more suited for the likes of a school bus.  

OVERALL:  If you can find an good deal on one (I paid $16,999 plus TTL) you are in for a great driving experience from Nissan.  If style, performance, and lots of room are on the top of your list for buying cars, the Altima will not disappoint.
