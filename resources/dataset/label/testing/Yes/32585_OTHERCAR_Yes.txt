            This car was bought at a Toyota dealership with 32,000 miles and two years on it. Our family has added 18,000 miles and 2 1/2 years to it.

Nice Features:
Daytime running headlights are great. My husband and I both believe that this feature has saved us from more than one accident.

Child safety lock is great.  My boys can't accidentally open the doors.

Driver and passenger airbags.

The trunk is larger than it looks from the outside. Also, the back seat fold down easily if you need the extra cargo space.

Rear window defroster is very helpful.

Owner's handbook is readable, and has a hardcover.

Drawbacks:
Not a whole bunch of room inside.  Either the people in front are comfortable, or the people in back are.

Can't put a child 12 or younger in front with airbag; there's no way to turn it off.

The engine is a little loud.

No air vents in back.

No keyed entry for rear doors; you have to reach around from the front doors to unlock them.

Experiences (Accidents):
My husband hit a deer with this car at 45 mph, and came home with a front corner dented and the hood crunched. It was still perfectly driveable. After replacing the side panel (it's not metal-it's a composite), hood, and some other parts, our car looked like new again.  There was no paint job - none was needed. I have not noticed any lasting bad effects from the accident.

Problems:
Soon after buying it, the CD player started having trouble, but I didn't take it to the Saturn dealership right away.  Needless to say, by the time we took it in, the warranty had run out. Their suggestion: buy a new (non-Saturn) one to replace it.

The handles above the passenger doors came off easily, even when I tried to tighten the screws. I gave up and took them completely off.

The car doesn't like to shift into reverse; you have to use a little more force on it, and sometimes I have to try a couple of times before it's in gear.

The wiring to the radio has been loose, causing the sound to lose the treble or bass. Recently, I have been unable to get any sound. Occasionally the speakers will pop when the radio is turned off. My husband was told at the dealership that the loose wiring is common, but I don't know how many have the full extent of these problems.

The only thing we have had to fix outside of an accident was a sensor on the engine that determined the number of RPMs the engine should be running at. Failure of this sensor caused the car to randomly stall, and eventually, not even start. Cost to repair? $55, completed the same day at our local Saturn dealership.
