            The FinePix A303 is an easy-to-use camera for a person looking to produce quality photos all at a reasonable price. The camera comes with a 16MB (megabyte) xD Picture card and can accept cards up to 256MB!  With the 16MB card that comes with the camera, you can take up to 122 shots! I personally purchased the 64MB card, and that can hold up to 498 pictures!  

This camera is compact in size so you don't have to lug it around.  It can easily fit into your pocket, measuring 3.8 inches wide by 2.5 inches high by 1.4 inches thick and  weighs just over 7 ounces.  

This camera can be purchased at most stores for $299, but I purchased mine for only $275.  You can view the range of prices here on the Epinion website.  If you look in the right spot you can get the camera for as low as $248.

The movie mode, unfortunately, does not offer sound.  With the 16MB card that comes with the camera, you can record anywhere from 60 seconds to 4 minutes, depending on the quality of pixels you set the camera to.  The movies are saved in the AVI format.  You can't zoom in and out during the movie mode and if the lighting isn't adequate, you'll find that the image quality is not the best.  

The photo sizes available are 2048 x 1536, 1600 x 1200, 1280 x 960 and 640 x 480 pixels. 

On the back of the camera there is a 1.5-inch color LCD (about 60,000 pixels) screen for photo and movie playback as well as camera adjustments.

The wide-angle range of the flash is about 1 ft-11.5 ft.
The telephoto-angle is about 2 ft- 9.8 ft.

The flash settings consist of of Auto, Red-Eye-Reduction, Forced-on, Forced-off and Slow-Synchro.  So depending on what kind of picture-taking surroundings there are, you have you options to get the best quality photo.

The Fuji FinePix A303 digital camera includes:   
A 16Mb xD Picture card 
Two AA alkaline batteries 
A USB cable and Hand Strap 
A 131 page manual 
A CD with the needed drivers for Windows and a Macintosh. Software includes, FinePixViewer, ImageMixer VCD for FinePix, DP Editor and Apple QuickTime 5.0. 

I feel the draw back of this camera is the movie mode.  It has no sound and its quality isn't the best.

If you buy this camera, I recommend purchasing rechargeable batteries.  It will save you a lot of money.  I would probably try to get a better picture card as well.  If you plan on taking a lot of photos, you may want a bigger card.
