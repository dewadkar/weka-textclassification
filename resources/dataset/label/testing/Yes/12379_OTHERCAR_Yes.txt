            I purchased this camera about a year ago.  Let me first tell you I knew NOTHING about Digital Camera's.  All I knew was that I wanted one.  When you have family spread across the country side it's great to be able to be talking to them and then share a picture.  An example, My father lives on the total opposite side of the United States during the winter months.  We only see him 6 months of the year, which also means that he sees his grandchildren only six months out of each year.  With this camera he still gets to see his grandson at that very moment.  No waiting for film to be developed and then scanned or mailed through regular mail.  I could be talking to him on AOL instant messanger and at that moment take a picture. Here you go,  this is us right now.  He recieves it immidiatly.  It's great.  I can take pictures outside too and send those.  

This camera isn't like a web camera that has to be connected to your computer in order for it to work,  I could take it on a trip,  or anywhere.  When I come back, I just plug a cord into it, and the picture downloads onto the computer.  It takes only a matter of 2 minutes to do it.  It's great and I love it.

It's very easy to use.   The only problem I have had with the camera is that you have to use batteries.  It has an adaptor plug in for a 6 volt plug, but where do you find those???  I've tried, and had no success yet. I started buying rechargable batteries, but even they wear out after a while.  I still havn't explored ALL the possabilities that this camera can do yet,  but one day I will spend the time to do it.  

The cost isn't to bad when you compare them to other digital camera's... But then again maybe other digital camera's offer more options.  All I can say is that I'm very happy with my Casio camera.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to take pictures and certainly to anyone who has someone far away that they want to share their pictures with.

The only thing negative really that I can think of is this....  You can look at the picture on the camera, and think,  &quot;WOW that's clear quality&quot; then you load it onto your computer, and again,  &quot;Wow that's a nice quality picture&quot;  but unless you have a &quot;NICE QUALITY&quot; Printer, you have garbage for a picture if you try to print it out.  But you can't have everything can you?  I still think the camera is well worth it's money.<br><br>
