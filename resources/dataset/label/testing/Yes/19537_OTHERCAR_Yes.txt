            I purchased a Tercel while in law school to keep the note low and the miles high. I haven't been disappointed yet. The Tercel was discontinued recently, but expect to see this car on the road for many years to come.

This car drives itself. Expect gas mileage galore in the manual five speed in the neighborhood of 34 to 37 miles per gallon. A ten gallon tank of gas will get you to work and back for a good two weeks.

The interior is basic with no frills. As a matter of fact, the whole car is basic with no frills. Count out the cd player and cruise control, power mirrors and intermittent wipers. The car's frills include an air conditioner and power steering. Not even a cassette player.

For the price, the car is everything a first time car owner would need - cheap, reliable, and efficient. The four cylinder has got some unexpected pick up, and it's highway miles are pleasant if not traveling more than 200 miles at a time. The seat tends to get a bit uncomfortable on lengthy travels. 

The back seat is roomy for passengers, and the trunk is sizable enough for your own junk or the junk of others traveling with you. 

Overall I'm very happy with the car. I've been out of law school for a while, and in the law business for a few years and the car is still with me. I've considered trading it for a Honda or Acura, but have decided that those cars are just a small step up, and not worth getting rid of this totally reliable and adequate auto. My last Toyota took me about 150,000 miles...and I think that was probably without an oil change. I expect to have this little car even after I've reached the six digit income...just to spite those Lexus driving partners who actually pay a note every months. Oh what a feeling to drive...Toyota.
