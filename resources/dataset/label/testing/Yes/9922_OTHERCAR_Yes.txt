                 Bought 92 Celica, used, because wife's 86 still running strong and trouble free except for periodic maintenance. With 126,000, mainly highway mileage, felt it will get over 200,000 without major problems. Used for short hauls, about 5-7000 yearly, it's proven it's worth
  
     Comfortable interior although small. Instruments and controls are readily visible and handy. Well controlled driving amd cornering with tight wheelbase. Small spare tire is inconvenient but haven't needed same. Only minor repair on exhaust manifold required in 2 years. Mechanic estimates car will give me the 200,000 miles I wanted without question. Enjoy driving it with confidence that it is Toyota built. We've bought nothing but Toyota's since 1978 and feel it's the best of the lot. Tried Nissan, Ford, and Chevrolet earlier and found all unacceptable and not comparable in driving, comfort or longevity. From here on - It's Toyota!
