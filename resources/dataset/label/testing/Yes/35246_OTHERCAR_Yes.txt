            They say necessity is the mother of invention.  I'm not entirely sure what that quote has to do with this review, but I guess it sounded appropriate when I wrote it.  Well, actually maybe it DOES have something to do with this.  You see, the payments on my '99 Chevy S-10 pickup were getting to be more than a little out of hand, and I needed something cheaper to bring my payments down to a reasonable level.  And through a little padding (and a lot of luck) I managed to do that by securing a brand-new, 2001 Cavalier, fresh off the dealer's lot.  Though it's obvious that price was a major concern, I wouldn't have signed the title if I didn't like the car.

The Cavalier was freshened up a bit for 2000, meaning the front and rear ends were altered slightly, and they changed a couple interior bits.  Not a full-on redesign like the '95 model was, but more of a facelift.  The car struck me as handsome, and fairly stylish, but not outrageously so.  Some may consider it plain or bland, but I like it just fine, and so will a lot of other people.  My vehicle is silver, with the stock wheel covers. (it looks exactly like the one in the picture, to give you an idea)

Interior room in the Cavalier is actually pretty good.  There's a good amount of head and leg room in the front seats, and the seats themselves are supportive and comfortable.  I wouldn't stick anyone in the back for long, though.  The dash and control layout is well-done, although I would've preferred the HVAC controls to be mounted higher on the dashboard than buried near the shifter, like they are now.  The knobs themselves are large and easy to use.  Visibility, as to be expected out of a small 2-door, is very good.  There's lots of glass all around, making it easy to see around the car, especially in the rear.  There is a small blind spot around the trunk, but it's easily worked with, unlike the much larger blind spots that some other cars create.

Power comes from a 2.2L SOHC 4-cylinder engine mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission.  Throttle response is good, and power delivery, while a bit buzzy, is reasonably smooth, especially for a 4-cylinder.  There's no mistaking that engine for a four, though.  It's not a terribly strong powerplant, so don't expect to be pulling any smokey burnouts in this thing.  It's adequate for around-town driving and highway cruising, though, and has a good amount of mid-range power for passing.  The 3-speed auto is a decent enough automatic, but tends to hunt for the right gear on steep hills.  The 4-speed auto, from my experience with GM automatics, does this as well, so a fourth cog wouldn't have helped matters any.

The car handles nimbly, as is common for small cars like this, but again, it's no Corvette.  Brakes are also good, with responsive pedal feel and good performance from the ABS.  Should the worst happen, second-generation airbags and numerous other safety features will help to protect you.

The Cavalier has always been one of GM's top sellers, and it's obvious why.  It's a good, well-rounded economy car that does a lot of things well, and nothing really poorly.  While a little more power in the low-end would've been nice to have, I can't complain much for what I've got.  The truth is, this is a solid, well-built, well-designed car that should last me and anyone else a good long time.
