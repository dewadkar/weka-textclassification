            In a day and age of either MONSTER SUVs (Ford Expedition, Chevy Blazer, et al) that serve no purpose other than take two spots in the parking lot, driven by barely competant drivers, and the onslaught of the PRETEND SUVs (Isuzu, Nissan, Toyota, etc.), it was great to see the 2000 Dodge Durangos continue to lead the pack...genuinely SPORTY...perfectly suited for any UTILITY use.

In June I traded in a 1996 Dodge Ram, 4x4, loaded to the teeth.  I loved that truck.  But I needed better gas mileage and more than &quot;just a truck.&quot;  Of course, I headed down to Perkins Dodge in Colorado Springs, Colorado (whom I recommend with 6 stars), and found the perfect Durango (completely loaded).

I gave up only a little in towing capacity (I still can pull 8500 lbs with that impressive 5.9L Magnum V8), with the same engine as had been in my truck, but gained CONSIDERABLE gas mileage (how does 20 mpg highway grab you?  Dodge only claimed 16 mpg on the highway).  I gained a massive amount of interior cargo room, seating for 8 COMFORTABLY, and a flexibility in carrying that I didn't believe possible (2 rows of back seats, middle fold up or roll out of the way, back lay down or move the seat and have a ton of ground cargo space...amazing).

How about the &quot;niceties&quot; you ask?  Although they can be pricy (unless you have a dealer like Perkins Dodge who do $400 over invoice, no arguing, no fighting, no haggling), they are well worth the scratch.  Back airconditioning...must have.  Infinity stereo with CD and Tape...definate must have.  Leather interior?  I didn't want it, but this was the only Durango on the lot with everything else I wanted and needed, so I got leather interior.  I won't ever go back to cloth.  Underside skid plates...don't go off road without 'em!  There are dozens of other wonderful extras (on-board trip computer!), all worth their weight in gold.

Finally, the price.  Durangos aren't cheap.  The right dealer saved me $7000 of sticker, plus add in Dodge's $2000 rebate, I was giddy.

I am completely happy with Durango, in all its Brilliant Platinum colored glory.  And I know you will be, as well.<br><br>
