            Well Mercedes Benz has done it again.  The german automotive giant has
built a rough and durable SUV. The first thing that attracted me to this
fine piece of machinery was the price.  Even though Mercedes is NOT known
for low pricing... this SUV is definitely priced right for the value.
It handles very well on the highway and in your suburban areas.  It has
plenty of room and rides like you are floating on a cloud. The only thing
that I would really like to have had on this vehicle would have been a
wench... for that off road attitude!! If closing... If you are looking
for an SUV I would recommend the Mercedes Benz ML line.  They offer alot
and are world renowned for safety!
