            I picked up my Impala on Memorial Day, 2001, and have put about 4600 miles on it.  So far I have found the car to be QUITE comfortable for the "Office-on-the-road" driving I deal with daily.

I would definitely recommend getting the 3.8L engine that is an option on the base model Impala and is std. on the LS edition.  We are looking at Olds Alero's for my wife and it has the same 3.4L engine.  It works well in that car but it seems in this car to be a tiny bit underpowered.  You wont' regret the larger engine.

Many are going w/ the base model (for the bench-seating up front) and getting the larger engine and sportier suspension.  I wanted the LS for the bucket seats up front.  The trunk is ENORMOUS and can fit most anything.  They do say the lip around the trunk someone makes it difficult to take advantage of all teh space, but I haven't encountered that.

I've read that GM brake rotors warp, so this may be a future problem for me to encounter, but the LARGE brakes on this vehicle are QUITE nice.  Road noise has been a problem for some, but I had an ALtima before this so this seems to be a SILENT ride compared to that vehicle.

All in all I would HIGHLY recommend this vehicle if you are looking for something bigger then the Accord/Camry line of vehicles.  I look at those as well as the Dodge Intrepid and Ford Taurus.  The powerplant in this vehcile, although somewhat antiquated (older pushrod 3800 series vs. newer OHC engines) is tried n' tested and I found that the design's age NOT to be a factor.
