            The 2000 Toyota Sienna LX minivan has met my family's expectations.  We purchased it new to replace a 1995 Ford Winstar, and we immediately noticed how much quieter and "solid" the Toyota was.  After nearly 50,000 miles, the van has never returned to the Toyota dealer, needing only routine oil and filter changes and a set of tires.  We have taken the Sienna on several vacation trips, and find it very comfortable.  The seat folding and removal is much easier than our previous van.  Fuel economy and acceleration is good.  It handles and brakes well.

In three years, we have only encountered two minor issues:

1.  The tire pressure indicator light sometimes comes on, causing my wife to ask me to check the tires.  All four tires are always at their correct pressures, and I reset the light as instructed in the manual.  Unfortunately, this reoccurs about every 6 months.  For this reason, I would not pay much attention if the light came on during a trip - and this defeats the purpose of the light.

2.  The CD player has occasionally skipped on mild bumps since the van was new.  It does not seem to get any worse.

I have read about oil sludge buildup problems with the V6 used in the Sienna.  I recently saw an article stating that Toyota had acknowledged the problem and had agreed to repair it, as long as the owner had proof of reasonable maintenance.  This eased my mind on that issue.  I have not seen any symptoms of this problem in our Sienna.

Overall, I would highly recommend the 2000 Toyota Sienna to anyone looking for a comfortable, reliable family vehicle.
