            I never thought I was the &quot;type&quot; to drive a minivan but when I was pregnant with our second son it quickly became apparent that we were outgrowing our Altima. Considering that we owned two other Nissan's we thought Nissan was a good place to look first. 

We immediately fell in love with everything about the Quest and upon comparison shopping found nothing that suited our tastes and needs that was comparable to the Quest price wise. It was incredible how smooth and quiet the ride was. I have never been a big car person and was a little worried about parking, turning, backing up, etc. but found very quickly how easily the Quest handled. One feature I especially like is the turn signal light. At night it illuminates the side of the road so you can see where you're turning, great for someone just getting used to a big vehicle. Another feature I love is the ease with with the seats are removable and adjustable. 

I was also impressed with the gas mileage, we average about 21MPG, much better than I had expected. My only complaints are that our van doesn't have the dual sliding doors which is inconvenient for me with two kids in carseats. Also the rear air for both seats is located on the drivers side wall so it doesn't reach all passengers equally, a huge annoyance for picky kids. Overall I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy a minivan. In the two years we've own our Quest it's never been to the shop for anything other than routine maintenance.<br><br>
