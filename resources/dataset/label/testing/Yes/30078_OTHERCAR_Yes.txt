            There are very few purchases I make in the technology arena that my wife cares about, let alone actually likes.  The KODAK DC280 has been a tremendous hit!  Purchased before the birth of my son (see pictures at www.springernet.com) These camera has enough features to keep the technologist satisfied, yet it is simple enough for the technophobe to use.  The photos, 2.0 megapixel are clear enough to print 8x10 photos.  The zoom feature is more than ample for basic family photos.  The camera is easy to use!  When your out on the strip in Vegas and you ask the tourist next to you to snap a picture, it works as if it where a phd (push her dummy) camera.  It's actually hard to take really bad photos.
This camera would not be great for professionals but it is certainly more than adequate to capture a families moments. 

Happy photos!
