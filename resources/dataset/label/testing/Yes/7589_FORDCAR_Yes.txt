            I recently traded my Ford Explorer in for an Expedition, and have enjoyed the smooth ride as well as the room.  Four infant seats and four adults fit comfortably, and the removable third seat is great for storage space.  There are also many options available for those who love to have all the extras.

I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with small children or anyone who needs the extra room that the Expedition gives you over the smaller sport utility vehicles.

The only thing that I don't care for is the gas mileage.
Mine only gets around 13 miles to the gallon.
