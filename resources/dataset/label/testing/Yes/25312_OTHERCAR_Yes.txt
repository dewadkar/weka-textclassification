            Had I written this review when I first got my coolpix it would've been five stars all the way with no complaints.  Now that the honeymoon is over and I can give you a realistic critique, but even with the camera's quirks, overall I am still in love.  

First let me state that this camera is not the best choice for beginners or anyone really who doesn't want to work.  This camera does an okay job with point and shoot, but it would be a waste to have this camera and not take advantage of its many wonderful abilities.

The body of the 5700 is the much like a classic camera.  It even accepts certain wide angle and zoom lenses.  The advantage over a 35mm is of course that you get to preview your pictures automatically.  You can even take short movies with sound and video.

My one gripe about the body of the camera would be the position of the flash.  In all of my previous cameras the flash has been off to the side, but with this one its right above the lens.  As a sole light source this flash will give close up subjects an unpleasant dark shadow outline.  If the flash was positioned to the side or just somewhere not so close to the lens, the shadow wouldn't be quite as obvious.  However like most good cameras, the 5700 accepts external flashes.  I am saving up for one now.

The picture quality and detail from this camera is absolutely amazing.  Sometimes there's almost TOO much detail, even more detail than what I can see with my unaided eyes.  For instance, once I took several shots of my baby girl trying to get the perfect picture, but once I HAD the perfect photo and looked at it full size, I realized she had a piece of lint or something on her nose.  I couldn't see then lint when we were taking the pictures, but the camera picked it up.  Luckily lint is not too hard to edit out.

Low light pictures from this camera have come out exceptionally well, though the autofocus doesn't work well in low contrast situations.  The higher ISO settings do leave plenty of grain in the picture but the noise reduction mode seems to help though it does slow things down a bit.

Speaking of speed, if you purchase this or any other 5+ megapixel camera, you are going to want a big card.  Take my advice here and buy at least an 8 speed, or you may become frustrated while you wait for these huge files to record.  I have an 8 speed card and a no name no speed card.  The card I'm using makes a big difference in how I'm feeling about the camera, so get a good card.

Overall the coolpix is indeed VERY cool.  If you're into photography and are willing to spend some time learning the ropes of this highly capable camera, I strongly recommend it.
