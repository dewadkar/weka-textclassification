            I got this camera for about $50 on ebay (it retails for around $140), and have been very happy with my purchase.  I've been wanting to try out a digital camera for some time now, but don't have the $300+ to buy a really nice one.  This camera is small and easy to pack and takes pretty good pictures, provided the lighting is alright.  It comes with some good software as well.

The main thing this camera lacks is a stronger flash.  Unless the subject is right in front of you the flash doesn't do much for you.  I recommend using this camera for mainly outdoor events.  The camera is supposed to double as a video conferencing camera as well.  I haven't had much experience using this part of the camera, or other video conferencing units, so i don't have much to say on the subject.  I got a very poor, sluggish image..but i'm trying to figure out if that is my computer's fault or the camera's fault.  

All in all i'm very pleased with my purchase.  Its quality has surpassed what i was expecting when i bought the inexpensive camera.  It has served its purpose in helping me decide if i want to move on to a more expensive digital camera, or just stick with my 35mm.
