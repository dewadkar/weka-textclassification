            I don't personally have the camera, but a dear friend of mine lent me his for about a week.  I must say that I went camera happy!  Taking pictures of everything I could!  The camera was so easy to use that I wanted to take more and more pictures.  Just load the memory card into the camera and your ready to take pictures.  When you ready to see them, take the memory card out and put it into the floppy and insert into computer.  That's it!  The software that comes with the camera is great too.  You can &quot;decorate&quot; your pictures and send them via email.  It also has a great way to build webpages with your pictures.  I love the camera and will get one as soon as I can.<br><br>
