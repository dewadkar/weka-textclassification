            The Rav4 is an affordable SUV vehicle.  Generally it is an ok car.  Two major problems are the back seat is very small and so is the engine.  If you like to drive a lot of friends around for long drives, forget the RAV.  If you like to have some power and not drive a sluggish car, forget the RAV.  I personally like to drive up high so I can see so the RAV is great for that.  The RAV is also good off road (although I wouldn't even attempt to compare it to the Jeep Wrangler).  The interior front seats are very comfortable and the trunk area is roomy. Basically, this car is good for older women and it is a great car for parents who want to buy their kids a good car but one that they know the kids won't  be racine (engine too small).<br><br>
