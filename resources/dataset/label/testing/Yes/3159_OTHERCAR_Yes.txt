            I just bought my 2000 Hyundai Elantra with package 4 and automatic after months on exhaustive research and endless test drives of other economy cars.  I looked at every economy car available because I was leary about buying a Hyundai, but after reading the opinions of the other owners I decided to give the Hyundai a try.  For cars in this class it was quick, quiet had loads of standard features, and a great warranty.  That and the fact that the only other car that was even acceptable was the Mazda Protege, and it was $3000 more and my decision was easy.  There are some drawbacks with the car though they are minor.  The seats are very firm, the cup holders are poorly positioned , and there is no passenger controls for the power locks.  But these are all very minor and I am very pleased with the car.<br><br>
