            I bought my Kia in October of 1997.  I had two children at the time and thought that a new car was in the best interest for my family.  When I went to the dealership, I was actually looking at the Sportage but the Sephia caught my eye instead.  With a few extra options (i.e, sunroof, spoiler kit, and alloy wheels), the price could not be beat - it only cost me $14,000 total (I even got to keep the original wheels).

My Sephia gets great gas mileage (approximately 28-30 MPG) and I only had it in the shop twice since I got it.  Driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic every day with my Kia is much better than it was when I was driving my Chevy Cavalier Station wagon.

The only downfall I have found was that the interior of the car is small.  I had another child since I bought the car and it gets very tight.  Even though the car has rear fold-down seats, you can't fold down the seats with children in the car.

All in all, I LOVE MY KIA and if they build a mini-van, that would be my next vehicle.
