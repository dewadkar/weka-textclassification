            The title of the article is taken from a Mazda ad that was run in USA Today after winning the recent Car & Driver Sport Wagon Shootout.

The Protege5 body style has been available in Europe and Japan for some time (badged as the Familia outside North America), but in late 2001, North Americans got to join the party. Unfortunately, neither all wheel drive nor the 170 HP J-spec engine are available.

I purchased this car to be used as a daily commuter. For the price, I do not think there is a better looking or better handling car on the road today. 

<b> Exterior </b>

Admittedly, I am biased, but I think that the Protege5 is the best looking car for under $20k. It shares the same front fascia with the Mazda MP3 and upcoming Mazdaspeed Protege. When comparing the Protege5 in the looks department against a Focus ZX3 or ZX5, the fugly Suzuki Aerio, or even the Matrix/Vibe twins, the Protege5 comes way ahead. I'm a sucker for retro, so I won't say that the Protege5 is better looking than the PT Cruiser. However, I believe Mazda is selling 17 to 20 thousand Protege5s a year, whereas the PT Cruiser sold 125,000 cars in its first year alone, with production ramping even higher to meet demand. The Protege5 has an aura of exclusivity, a rarity in this price segment. When I first bought my Protege5, I would almost never see another one on the road. The Protege5 is somewhat more common now ( I usually see a few a day) but is nowhere near as common as any Honda or Toyota product, a plus in my book.

The Protege5 has exceptionally clean lines that are similar to the much more upmarket Lexus IS300 Sportcross. I was in the next lane to an IS300 Sportcross the other day and was amazed at how similar the cars are from the exterior. The Protege5 has a limited colour palette (Yellow, Red, Silver, White, Blue and Black) but all the colours look like they belong on such a sporty wagon.

The standard 16 inch alloy wheels fill the wheel well nicely, and complement the car's aggressive look. Another nice touch on the exterior is the absence of a lot of black or chrome trim- everything is body coloured.

The whip antenna on the roof is also a nice touch, and the standard roof rack adds some additional potential cargo capacity, making this wagon even more useful for hauling, without detracting from the car's visual appeal.

<b> Interior </b>

The Protege5 interior is quite comfortable and extremely functional. Everything is well placed within the driver's reach. The interior is black, with black cloth seating. The cloth has a subtle silver and blue design. Interior plastic is either black or silver, and the radio is surrounded by faux carbon fibre inserts. I'm going to take some time to rave about the steering wheel. The three point steering wheel is making a comeback among auto manufacturers, and I couldn't be happier that Mazda is on the forefront of this trend. The steering wheel has a great, comfortable feel to it and provides excellent feedback. 

The gauge cluster is also very nice, with white gauge faces. At night, the numbers on the gauges are illuminated, giving the gauges a red on black effect instead of the black on white seen during the day.

The stock radio is not up to par with the rest of the car. The speakers sound muddy. The six disc changer in the dash is nice, and the fact that the stock stereo is double DIN sized does make it much easier to hit the buttons you want to press as opposed to the single DIN units with their microscopic buttons.

The air conditioning is good, but not great. However, I live in an area where the summers get quite hot, so your mileage may vary. The heat, on the other hand, is exceptional.

The fog lights on this car are more for show than go. I've not had mine adjusted yet, but the fog lights do not throw light more than about 5 feet in front of the car.

As far as interior noise goes, the Protege5 is both quiet and loud at the same time. Confused? Let me explain. The Protege5 is good at filtering out most of the noise you don't want (roaring tires, road noise) while allowing engine noise to be clearly heard. There is one unfortunate side effect of the roof rack, and it is well documented among Protege5 enthusiasts. At approximately 60mph, the roof rack will begin to whistle. Wind noise does tend to penetrate the cabin somewhat as well.

The seats, front and rear, are quite comfortable, and there is truly room for four real-sized adults in the cabin.

The armrest between the front seats is also a storage bin, and will fit a few CDs, sunglasses, etc. The cupholders in the Protege5 are steathily concealed under a panel in the center console. There is not a huge amount of storage space in nooks in the Protege5, but between the doors, the glove box, the armrest, and an area behind the cupholders, there is enough.

A feature to note is that unlike most small four door cars, the Protege5 rear windows do go down most of the way (probably 80%) as opposed to some small cars whose rear windows maybe go halfway down.

The rear cargo area of the Protege5 is huge, and can be made larger by folding the rear seats flat to make a flat load floor. This is accomplished by removing the rear seat cushions and headrests to allow the back of the seat to fold almost completely flat. There are also accommodations for 3 tether straps in the back seat for child car seats, although I doubt that 3 car seats would fit in the rear bench. With the seats up, the cargo area is concealed by a privacy shelf.  You might be able to store light weight items on this shelf, but it does not appear to be designed to bear heavy loads.

<b>Performance</b>

The Protege5 could use more power, but I've yet to run into an enthusiast who actually thought his or her car did not need more power. When driven assertively, there is more than enough power for around town, highway passing, and merging into traffic. No, the Protege5 is not going to win many stoplight races, but the Protege5 was not designed with straight-line power in mind. Instead, the Protege5 amply demonstrates Mazda's brilliance in suspension design. The Protege5 handles as well or better than cars that cost several thousands of dollars more, without the suspension being harsh or teeth-rattlingly stiff. The stock Dunlops are a great tire, the 16 wheels are decent looking stock wheels, and the car just out and out sticks to the road. When Mazda talks about the "emotion of motion" and what it means to drive a Mazda- well, if you own a Mazda you know what I am talking about. You find yourself in the car with a wide open grin on your face, and you're not really sure why.

<b> Aftermarket </b>
The aftermarket is really starting to warm up for the third generation Proteges, Protege5 included. Body kits from West Wings, turbo kits, carbon fibre hoods, hot cams, cat-back exhausts, intakes and headers are all available for the Protege5.

<b> Driving Experiences </b>

I simply love to drive this car. From the time I twist the key to the moment I lock the car with the remote, I have a smile on my face. The way the engine revs freely to 6000rpm, and the tires bite into the pavement remind me that I made the right choice when I chose the Protege5. A slight grin becomes a somewhat maniacal smile on twisty roads as I throw the car through the corners and the side bolsters of the seat hold me in place. The Protege5 just begs to be driven harder and harder. Zoom zoom indeed!

<b> Conclusion </b>

Mazda has hit a home run with the Protege5. It is an excellent value, and recently won a "sport wagon/hatchback" comparison in Car & Driver against the likes of the Matrix/Vibe, Focus ZX5, PT Cruiser and Aerio.

I highly recommend a test drive, as your choice of car is certainly a very personal one, and a decision that most of us have to live with for quite some time. You won't regret it!
