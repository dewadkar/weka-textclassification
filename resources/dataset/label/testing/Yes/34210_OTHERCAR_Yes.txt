            Before I say anything about the value of this camera, I have to warn you that certain places charge much more than others. If you go to a store without comparison shopping before hand you could end up overpaying for this camera very dearly. I found that the price can vary as much as $330 to $450 for the same exact camera. Anyway, after using the camera a few times I realized that it produces very good quality images and can store enough images for a short venture. (If you go on a long trip and don't have time to copy the photos onto your computer you might have to upgrade the storage card so that you can store more pictures inside tha camera).
You can choose between three different types of photos: Best, Better, or Good.  The good setting takes the least amount of space in your camera but the quality is slightly compromised. With the best setting you can make very good quality images but you can only store a few images in the camera before transferring them to your computer. I've been able to use a couple of my friends digital cameras which were in the same price range. After using each one I thought that the vivitar 2800 produced better quality images but you couldn't store as many pictures as the others. This is probably because the storage card that comes with the vivitar 2800 can only store 4MB instead of 8MB as my friends did.  

But overall the image quality is very good and I give the camera a 4 out of 5 for value

However before buying any digital camera make sure you have a steady supply of batteries. They eat up power faster than anything I can think of!<br><br>
