            I haven�t written an Epinion in months and, to be honest, it felt great to have free time that wasn�t spent browsing a website. In the last couple of months, I have done many, many things. From buying a �new� guitar from 1980, to going on tour with my music group in the United Kingdom, to doing the whole school exam process (again), to buying my first new car� well, to me at least, my time has been both rewarding and well spent. 

However, I missed something during that time and now, as I return to the site once again, I realize that I was missing that feeling of community garnered from those dedicated to writing quality editorials here at Epinions. So now, almost three months to the day that I wrote my last Epinion, I sit down once again to write. Out of everything that I have done in the last couple of months, I think that buying my first new car was the most important thing that I should write about, as it marks an important milestone in my life. So here goes nothing� my Epinion about my first �baby,� my <I>Volvo S40</I>.


In the spring months of 2001, I started looking at various small to midsize cars that didn�t carry too heavy a price tag. I looked at a bunch of cars, but was the most impressed with the Audi A4, the Volkswagen Passat, and the Volvo S40. Don�t get me wrong, they are three great cars, so I did the test drive thing, the Consumer Reports thing, and basically came to the conclusion that the Volvo S40 was the best fit for me. Why? Here�s why.

Volvo is a car company known for one thing, their great safety record. Most people will not buy a Volvo due to the size of its engine or because of the fact that it looks good with a blonde in the front seat� you buy it because the car has the best chance of keeping you alive in an accident. This, for the most part, is why I bought my car, as Volvo is unparalleled when it comes to safety. 

So let�s talk about safety. Each new Volvo comes equipped with tons of airbags-- six in fact. There are the two typical driver/passenger airbags that pop out of the front of the driving wheel/dashboard. However, these are special airbags that deploy with different force depending on the severity of the crash, which will most likely lower your chance at getting injured by the airbag in a crash. In addition to this, there are two side airbags, which deploy from the side of the car to protect in case of being hit on the side. There are two more airbags that act like curtains during an accident, which deploy from between the two doors near the ceiling of the car. These curtain airbags protect the inhabitants of the car from head injuries, lacerations from broken glass, or being thrown from the car.    

In addition to all of these airbags, the car has other safety features including �crumple zones,� a revolutionary idea that basically says that, in a crash, certain parts of the car will crumple in order to absorb force. However, these zones are well thought out and are in places that will help keep you alive. There is also a whiplash protection system that works so that the seats give in such a way, during a rear end crash, that the chances of whiplash are minimized. Volvo also features daytime running lights, ABS brakes, a steel safety cage, three point seat belts, a rod in the front seats which allows you to make the seat more or less rigid (no more sore backs), and a special �winter mode� that helps keep a car from sliding on slippery roads. With all this and more, no wonder Volvo has impeccable safety records. 

Now that that has been said, let�s talk about the rest of the car. The S40 is marketed as the affordable, low end Volvo. However, I don�t really understand it. Sure, it is the smallest Volvo and the least expensive, but does that make it low end? I don�t think so. The only part of the car that could even be construed as �low end� is the engine, as it is a 1.9 liter, 4-cylinder engine. However, the engine has some good pick up, 160 horsepower and 170 torque, allowing for quick response when you press the gas pedal. I�m not sure how the engineers at Volvo did it, but the car rides really well�the engine never stalls on me, never sputters or coughs, and always accelerates fast as can be. It doesn�t feel like a 4-cylinder engine, so enough said on that. Each S40 comes standard with a five speed, microprocessor-controlled automatic transmission, so no hidden fees there. 

As I was saying above, the car handles really well. Like a typical Volvo, the gas and brake pedals are very responsive, allowing you to barely press your foot on the pedal and it�ll start to do whatever you desire. And, like any sports car, it accelerates like a dream. I�m not exactly sure if it goes 0-60 mph in three seconds, I haven�t tried it yet, but it can move with quite a punch. It also runs pretty quietly, so you don�t have to crank up your music to drown out the engine. The car handles like a dream, one of the smoothest rides that I�ve ever encountered-- you rarely feel the slightest bump or hill when you�re riding. The power steering is great, allowing you to just relax and drive, rather than make you do all of the �over� steering that can be quite annoying in other cars. If you want to test out the steering, go into an empty parking lot and do some figure eight�s using only the tip of your finger� it�s that easy. 

What, you�ve never done figure eight�s in a car? All I can say is that you�re missing out. You see, I like to have fun in my cars, well good safe fun. You can tell, just by looking at the Volvo S40, that it is a fun car. Unlike the previous generations of Volvo�s, the S40 is not boxy or really square looking, instead, it has nice subtle curves. From certain angles, it doesn�t even look like a Volvo at all and I have been told that it resembles certain BMW�s. The only thing that makes it really look like the typical Volvo is the front grill and lights. Since I am having such a rough go at explaining what it looks like, go to volvocars.com for a picture. 

Some people complain that the plastic trim on the bottom of the car and on the door handles looks �cheap,� however, I think that it looks great, at least on my car. As I got the silver metallic color, the black plastic trim makes it look really sporty. The wheels are standard 15 inch, with eight spoke alloy hub caps. Personally, I love the way the car looks and, as it is available in a number of different colors and metallics, anyone can be pleased.

The inside of the car is just as nice as the outside. With four doors and room to fit five adults comfortably, the car is quite spacious (at least when compared in it�s �small� category). It features combination shoulder and lap seat belts for all five places in the car and adjustable headrests, making it safe and comfortable for children and adults. The back seat does not give you the most feet room, but just enough to be comfortable, it also has a nice arm rest that pulls down from the center of the back seat. There are reading lights in both the back and front of the car, as well as an option to turn all of the lights on with a single switch, which is very nice. 

One of the determining factors in buying my car was the sound system. The S40 has a pretty good sound system with standard AM-FM-Cassette and a bunch of speakers. The sound quality is decent and it is fairly easy to adjust the treble and bass levels throughout the car. You have to do an upgrade in order to get a single disc CD player in the dashboard of the car, but I think that it was well worth it. There are many different types of upgrades, with various prices, which include leather, a moon roof, a cold weather package, sport package, etc. It is also possible to get a multi-disc CD player put in the trunk, as it is pre-wired. 

Between the front two seats of the car there is a lot of room to store CDs, change, sunglasses, etc. There is plenty of space in this area to store a bunch of CDs, your garage door opener, your cell phone, and sunglasses�however, there are different areas so that it doesn�t get too cluttered or too disorganized. The glove compartment is also very roomy, with a special shelf for keys and pens that I�ve never seen before in any other car. Underneath the wheel, at the level of the driver�s knee, there is a special space to hold maps, which is really intelligent and convenient. Side pockets on the doors also help keep the car organized.  

The car only has two cup holders, one in the dash and one behind the center console, which is somewhat inconvenient. However, there are three power ports (cigarette lighters or av jacks) which allow you to plug your cell phone or computer in while you drive. The car comes with a special �information station� which includes a trip odometer, total mileage, estimated mileage until empty, average speed, outside temperature, elapsed time, etc. My S40 also includes cruise control, different speeds for the windshield wipers, windshield cleaner, two sets of keys and a valet key (drives car, but can�t open trunk), keyless remote entry, adjustable steering wheel, and a million more nice things.  

The trunk is really roomy, with enough space to hold a bunch of grocery bags or a full trip�s luggage. There are cargo nets and straps for holding the contents in place and even little basket type things to hold smaller items. If you have a lot of gear, then the rear seats can fold down in a 70/30 manner, allowing you to fit a full adult mountain bike in the back of your car. This car has more trunk space than most of the other cars on the market, which is amazing as it is such a small car.  

Gasoline has been pretty expensive as of late, which is another reason why I bought the S40. It is estimated to get between 22 miles per gallon in the city and 32 mpg on the highway. Personally, I get around 28 miles per gallon, which is great especially as the car takes regular gas. To fill up my car, I pay around $16.00 US, which lasts for about two weeks for me. Why buy an SUV, which gets about half of that and fits the same amount of people? As you can see, I love my Volvo S40.

Buying the actual car was not difficult at all. I went to the dealership where both of my parents bought their Volvos, and talked to a salesman who was very nice. He told me right off that I could get $1,000 off for �Volvo Loyalty� as someone in my family already bought a Volvo. We talked and he educated me about the car, the 4 years/50,000 mile warranty, before we got down to business. The actual car that I wanted (silver metallic S40, with taupe cloth interior, CD player in the dash) was not on lot, but we searched and found the car in Virginia. We signed the papers, they sent someone down to Virginia to pick my car up, and that was that. I had the car three days after I signed the papers for it, and actually bought the car for less than the list price that I found online. A couple of weeks later, the salesman even called me up to make sure that I was enjoying the car, which really impressed me. 


Overall, I think that the S40 is a great car and I am ecstatic about my purchase. There are only one or two things that I would change in the car, which would be adding one or two more speakers and cup holders. Besides that, I think that the car is perfect as is. Not only is it one of the safest cars on the market, it�s also fun to drive and fits easily into my daily life. It does everything and anything that I need it to, so I never have to worry about borrowing another car to go grocery shopping or drive in the snow. It also handles well, is great on fuel, and is well made. What more could you ask for? I whole heartedly recommend the Volvo S40, as I have had no problems with it. Thanks for reading and drive safely.
