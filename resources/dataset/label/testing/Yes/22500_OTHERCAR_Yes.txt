            I bought a Saturn because two of my friends bought
Saturns.  i do not regret making that choice.  The Saturn
has been reliable and performs like a sports car.

Good: the V6 propels me like a rocket when i need to
kick the tach up to 6500 RPMs.  I have put over 20K miles
on it in under a year, and it still feels like new.

The seats are comfortable and can fit a family of five.
Five adults will also fit in the car, though it does look
cramped.  The back seat folds down for carrying room in
the trunk.

The AC is great. The car has been on two long road trips
and some minor ones, and the AC works under all
conditions.

The damage-resistant body panels have withstood the
usual parking-lot dings.

Bad:  Tires were misaligned and wore out after 20K miles.
Interior fittings (seat belt pulley covers, seat latch covers)
can pop off easily.  Roof glue has dried out, and the roof
interior has a slight rattle to it.  Oil filter is $30 - $40 and
generally unavailable at non-Saturn oil change shops.

I would buy this car again, but I still have 5 years to go on
this one.
