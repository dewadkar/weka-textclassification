            I purchased a 2000 Ford Mustang back in October and it's electric green with tan interior.  It's a V-6 automatic w/overdrive, CD and Cass, power everything, cloth interior.  I love my little hot rod. I used to own a 1993 Mustang that I also bought brand new, it was a 4 cyl and still had quite the power for a little engine.  Some of the changes in the body styles were necessary, however the interior in my 2000 I am a little disappointed in.  It is definitely smaller on the inside and the amount of plastic almost gives it a "cheap" look and feel.  The door handles are more like small cups and very uncomfortable for the passenger to put his arm on.  Other than that, I'm extremely happy with my little car and it did very well driving to California with a bike rack on the back of it. It has excellent acceleration and I've had it passed 120 mph myself and I believe it has the potential to go a lot faster.  At that speed the rpm's were only 3500 and it was smooth as can be.  It can accelerate from 80 to 100 just like you were wanting to speed up from doing 20.  It's ready to have as much fun as you are!

I love Mustangs and I will buy another when this one is ready for retirement.
