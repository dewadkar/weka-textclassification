            I recently bought a 1999 Plymouth Breeze and absolutely love it.  It has great mileage, a smooth ride and has a really a sharp, sporty look.  I had never heard of this car before I test drove it and I loved it the minute I got into it.  It just fit me perfectly.  Not too big and for sure not too small.   There is ample room in both the front and back seats and the trunk is very large.  The only one downfall to the vehicle is that the trunk spoiler is a little high and makes it a little difficult to see exactly how much room you have behind you when you are backing up. But I have actually gotten used to it and it is not as obvious as when I first started driving the car.  Other than that there is nothing that I can say that I dislike about the car.  I am happy to be able to say that I have an American car that is fun to drive, looks great and that I plan to continue to buy American cars if they keep making them like this one.  I would absolutely recommend this car for single people (like myself) and for families who need the space for their kids.  The price was incredibly reasonable and gave me the opportunity to BUY my first NEW car.  Not something I would have been able to do with Honda, Nissan or Toyota.  <br><br>
