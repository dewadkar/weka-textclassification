            What a pleasant surprise, thought my Eldorado was a great vehicle for a roadtrip (it is) but I didn't expect the Blazer to offer good comfort on a long trip. It does! Mine is a '99 LS, with almost all the options, including a sunroof (highly recommended) 4 DR, 4X4. The cargo capability is great, and the 4DR version is long enough that I can stretch out in the back (I'm 6'3&quot;) if it's too nasty to pitch a tent. Plenty of power to get up and go, and while not a Lamborghini, will cruise comfortably at 75-80MPH all day (not that I'd drive that fast, mind you). Great visibility up front, and the controls are all logically placed and easy to operate (not distracting you from driving). Only options I'd liked to have added are the steering wheel mounted controls for the radio, and shield package. CD &amp; tape sound fine, heater is excellent. Mileage is high teens around town, low twenties on the highway, not bad considering the carrying and offroad capabilities. Accessory outlets are a nice touch.

On the road the Blazer is fine, slight leaning on curves, but it is an SUV, and, sitting higher, one should expect that. decent feedback from the road. Not having a truck-like ride can be a good thing, especially after 400 miles on the road. Not tiring at all. 

Might not have the feel or attention to detail of a Mercedes or BMW, but an excellent all around vehicle at a bargain price. Take the money you've saved and put it into gas and go see the country!<br><br>
