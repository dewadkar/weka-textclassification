            I have yet to find anything that I don't absolutely LOVE about this car! I got it my 2002 Jeep Liberty Limited the day after Christmas and have been driving it with pride ever since.

I opted for the Salsa-red color and got the Limited Edition because it was my first-ever "splurge" car - a midlife crises car if you will (although I am not NEARLY old enough for that ;-). I haven't regretted it.

The Liberty handles like a car, only better. It gives you the security of an SUV, and in Oregon where I get road spray, that's a good feeling. It handles corners like a sports car, but please remember it is an SUV so don't corner too sharply! Other features of the Liberty Ltd. are: leather, heated seats, moon roof (optional), power everything, remote entry, alarm, cruise, CD and tape players, wired for towing (optional), digital readout for outside temperature, miles to end of tank, current miles to the gallon and compass.

I could go on and on about this car. You can tell that I am pretty happy with it. You will be too once you test drive one. I have never owned a Jeep of any kind before, but I can tell you that I plan to drive this one until it DIES! Considering the quality I have experienced thus far, that will be a long time.
