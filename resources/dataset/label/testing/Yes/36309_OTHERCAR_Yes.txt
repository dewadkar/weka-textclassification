            The Motor Trend Car of the Year Award for 2003, is reason enough to reveal why this car is worth every penny.  The G35's styling is new and sexy.  The car is much bigger than it looks in pictures and has a very wide wheel base.  The front-midship-platform adjusts the weight of the car perfectly to help increase acceleration times and decrease braking distance.  The massive 3.5L DOHC V6 engine pumps out 260hp and is placed deep and far back into the hood bay so that the weight of the front and rear of the car is balanced.  The G35 is classified as a luxury "sport sedan".  Most luxury sedans are built to mask and diminish outside noise and engine rumbling, but Infiniti has made sure that the driver of this car can hear the growls of the engine and the nice deep exhaust note that is produced everytime your foot hits the accelerator.  The sports suspension is very good and the handling is very reponsive and controllable.  The manual gear shift is a nice extra that infiniti has integrated into the gearshift; it is responsive and has alot of kick at high rev.  The interior of the car is amazingly crafted. My car has a custom Carbon Fiber dash and matching trim which looks spectacular.  I got this through the dealer which costed an extra $400-500 dollars; the Carbon fiber is placed over the stock "stainless steel-like" trim or optional wood trim.  I also have the 17" optional rims which make the car look alot more sporty and the all-season W-rated racing tires.  All together this car is packed with technology and power.  FINALLY BMW HAS MET ITS MATCH!! The acceleration and breaking are both better than the BMW 330 series, and this was verified after smoking a BMW 325ci drop-top last night.  AT $7,000 grand less than a BMW, Infiniti has really hit the target this time by providing FAST, SLEEK, AND AFFORDABLE SPORTS SEDAN.
