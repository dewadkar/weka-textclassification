            Ultimate gadget! Upon delivery it took salesperson at least 30 min to show all the features and still few weeks later I'm fishing out new things out of humongous User's Manual. 

My favorites are self dimming side and rear mirrors, works like magic and gives piece of mind at night when SUV tailgates you with high beam on! Add to this trip computer, auto climate system with winsdhield defrost, plus heated seats, windshield washer nozzles and even key locks, plus washed front lights and list goes on and on. Incredible attention to safety, creature comforts and small details like full spare tire, small sun deflector under rearview mirror, safety triangle and instrument box, seff adjusting instrument lighting.

Rides & feels like a luxury German precision instrument, which it is. I can't add here more to many rave proffessional reviews and to the 170 hp 1.8T enigine that's for 2nd time is on a list of best world engines. Ride somehow manages to feel sporty and luxury at the same time. Very compliant and steady with almost limo silent cabin that's disturbed only by satisfying distant engine groan especially when turbo kicks in.

My Quattro with Sports package feels really glued to the road. I never drove anything that grips like this. I also test drove base 1.8T front drive. It also handles extremely well and is even peppier than Quattro due to lower weight. Actually I think that price wize base 1.8T is the only still in A4 line.

I like the Sports package with stiffer shocks, lower clearance and bigger tires but some with tyical US car tastes may consider it too firm. Same goes for front seats that are firm but confortable in a good German/European sports sedan style.

Engine exhibits brief turbo lag at low gear but turbo is very quick to kick in and stays with almost same strong push torque from 3rd gear and up. There's almost no need to down shift in 5th gear even when passing at 80/85 mph, power comes fast and plenty as though you're driving in 3rd. But watch out when trying to merge from low speed or quickly cross the street, there're power dead spots in 1st and 2nd gears where engine feels like dangerously droping the ball.

Minor gripes:

1. Middle console is nice but useless and have to be raised if you have something in 2 cup holders underneath. Both cup holders are also small.
2. Pop-out front cupholder hidden in instrument console on top of radio is a marvel of engineering but is even more useless and even dangerous.
3. No separate inside openers for fuel door and trunk.
4. Very hard to mount corded radar detector since lighter socket is tucked away between front seats. As a result I was forced to buy an inferior cordless detector.

All in all it's an exclusive car, fun to drive, safe and comfortable on long trips.
