            I am eighteen years old and last April my parents bought me a 1995 Camaro Coupe. This car is everything that I have looked for all packed into one superb vehicle. Since I have owned this car the only problem that I had is the starter. Other then that the car rides, handles, and performs beautifully. My car has the option of the Bose Stereo system which is really great. I like having a camaro because its a small, quick car. The only things that I don't like about it, is that it has really bad handling in wet conditions. The back end sometimes likes to slide out. This is the perfect beginners sports car that can really pack a punch. I recommend this car to anyone who is looking for an economic sports car that has performance for a small price.<br><br>
