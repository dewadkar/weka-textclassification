            This Lexus make you feel like your flying.It has a wonderful ride and is always a joy to ride in. This suv has the most comfortable ride that everytime I get in I immeadiatly fall asleep.We bought this vehicle because it is a nice looking suv, it rides well, and it is a great buy.I think that the only thing that I don't like about this vehicle is that sometimes, when you put just the back windows down they make a terrible sound that makes me sick. If you put all the windows down or just the front windows the sound then goes away. I recommend this vehicle to anyone that like a smooth,safe ride. <br><br>
