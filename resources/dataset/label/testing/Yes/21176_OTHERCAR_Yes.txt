            I just purchased a 1996 White extended cab 4x4 shortbed Chevy Pickup.  This truck is my baby.
I love the looks of the body style, the loud pipes, and the height of this truck.  With it being 4x4 it sits higher and gives a great feeling when you are driving down the road and sitting tall and proud.
I have to admit, I am a Ford person, but when we went out looking for a truck, I found this one sitting on a Chevy car lot and I think it was love at first site.  
While I was looking I had to keep in mind that we needed a &quot;strong&quot; truck to pull our 18 foot Rinker speedboat, and that we want to purchase a larger boat in the near future.  
I was also very hip on the extended cab series due to the fact that it would be our main vehicle for driving on trips and such.  I have personally sit in the backseat of this vehicle many times.  I have to say that it really isn't that bad at all.  Now I will admit if we was going long distance for a few hours then yes I would probably be concerned, but for the most part it is very comfortable.
My truck has the following features in it:
  Cruise control
  Extended cab
  Dual exhaust
  Cassette player
  4x4 
  Oversized tires
  Air conditioning

Basically just the basic features.
It is white on the outside and dark blue interior.
We just pulled the boat home from storage with it for the 1st time and it pulled it great, not a bit of hesitation, hardly knew it was back there.
I highly recommend the Chevy 1500 series.<br><br>
