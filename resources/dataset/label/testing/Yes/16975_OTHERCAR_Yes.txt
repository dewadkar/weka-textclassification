              I've noticed Geo(now considered Chevrolet) Trackers on the road for several years. They look like Lilliputian pickups with a cover. I never really considered buying one, but then one day I things had changed for me, and I bought one.
  I have a part time delivery job in which I use my own vehicle. I have to get in and out of the car lots of times in a day. My main vehicle is a Saturn SL2 which I love to drive, however hate to get in and out of, as it is quite painful after the first couple times in a day.(Yes, I am old enough that I don't get proofed when I buy my weekly 6-pack!) Therefore, I looked for a vehicle that requires stepping up to get in and stepping down to exit. I didn't care to spend a lot of money, so I looked at those Trackers in a very different way, and wound up buying one.

  Inside, the Tracker is not as small as it appears from the outside. There are two bucket seats and a lot of storage space in back. The seats recline, and there's quite a lot of leg room. Mine has a canvas convertible top, so when I park and put the seat back, especially in rain, it's almost like an RV camper.

  Driving the Tracker, at least the one I have, is providing exercise I hadn't expected. I do not have power steering, and it takes a lot of work to turn sharp corners. Also, the 5-speed transmission is a lot like that of an old-time military jeep(not that there's anything wrong with that!).
It is self-evident, with the canvas roof, that rolling this vehicle could have dire consequences, however this is also true of ANY vehicle. One thing that I strongly dislike: At 50,000 miles the CHECK ENGINE light pops on, causing the driver to pray that the engine computer doesn't cause the whole engine to disintegrate before professional attention is given to it. Since I bought this vehicle at 48,000 miles, I was the driver that got hit with this problem.

  Obviously, this is for one driver and one passenger. The smallest of additional passengers, human or otherwise won't have room here! In general, it's a neat vehicle and I like it. My back has stopped screaming at me about things like abuse, at least when I enter and exit my Tracker.It's great for trips around town, but I take my Saturn for long journeys as it is more comfortable on the road.<br><br>
