            Before I say a thing, I must thank my dad for getting me this schweet camara for my b-day last year, it is the best thing that has ever happened to me...yet it has one major problem.

To start off, the Canon Powershoot is one of the coolest things ever.  It is small, durable and the pictures are crisp and clear once you put them onto your computer.

Let me just say that if your lookin' to take pics that you will want to have physically to show your friends...this is not the camara for you.  If you want to make a handy lookin' web site or e-mail your pics to fellow friends...this IS the camara for you.

The Powershoot as many many many high-tec features that I wont get into this very moment.  The camara has about four settings and they all take brilliant photos.  What I love about this camara is that you can actually SEE the picture as soon as you take it, and if you don't like it, than you can immediatly delete it and start over.  The camara also has a great panoramic feature where you can take two pictures side by side, then patch them together for a panoramic wide lense view...AWESOM!!!!!!!!  

The problem with the camara is 1.) You have to LOAD up on assecories since you are not supplied with them when you first by the camara.  It comes with one 8 megabit chip that can hold about ten pictures at one time, no case, no strap, and no rechargable battery or battery charger just one battery that goes out very quickly.  So, these assecories add up to about 500 dollars EXTRA!!!  Thats right!!!  I paid about this much for a batter charger, 2 rechargable batteries, a case and a new 42 meg memory card that held about 100 exposures.

Aside from this set back, another good quality about this camara is that it can take pictures in various sizes, shapes and even color's!!!!  YEP!!! Thats right...you have the option of taking your pictures in a black and white color!!!  Cool huh?  And when they are loaded into your compuuter, it looks as if they are taken from the olden days....cool!

A flash is built into this camara along with an amazing DIGITAL ZOOM.  I think its an 8X digital zoom but i'm no positively sure.  Maybe it's 4...but anyway...I was at a Baseball game taking pictures and the digital zoom can get so close that it took perfect action shots of all of my favorite ball players!!!!!  I LOVE IT!!

This little camara has so much to offer, about 50 things on top of the ones I just talked about.  This camara really is worth the money, you wont be dissapointed at all.  If you get one digital camara this year, definatly make this the one.  I will not let you down.<br><br>
