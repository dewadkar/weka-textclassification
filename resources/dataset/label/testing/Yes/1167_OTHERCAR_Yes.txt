            Recently when I was on vacation, I had to rent a car to get around.  I went to enterprise rental and they gave a 2000 white Dodge Neon with a great fee, which I might add (I had the hook-up).  However, I just fell in love with this car being that I had it 4 weeks until I got a flat tire and they gave me something else, But I really did love this car.  The mileage and gas was great and it was just the right size for me and my family.  The controls were in hands reach and everything was so modern.  

I didnt expect a little car like this to have such good features since I thought I would never personally want to own one.  All in all this is a car I would actually want if I didnt have such great expectations (well I like to think big), but the car is practical and stylish.


The Dodge neon is a nice car to rent or own.<br><br>
