            The 1994 Alfa Romeo spider was the last year of the classic line of spiders. There were four versions of the classic spider. This was the best built, best looking, most reliable spider ever made (all 1991-1994 cars were the same).

I've enjoyed driving this one so much, that I plan on buying a 1991 version (I want that year model because the insurance is a bit lower, not to mention the asking price)   even though the 94 is the same. A commemoritive version was made that had fake wood trim for the interior. I don't think it does anything for it personally.

It's engine is rated a respectable 120 horsepower, and features a Bosch Motoronic engine which is the most reliable engine imaginable. It drives great now that it has power steering! It also features a drivers side airbag, and power windows and mirrors. This is a great car! Get one! I had fun driving this so much, I took the long way home.
