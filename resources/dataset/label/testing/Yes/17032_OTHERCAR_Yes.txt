            After looking for a new vehicle, my Ford Taurus died, I started to shop around.  I had always wanted an SUV.  My wife and I pulled into the local Dodge dealer in October of 1997 and I said &quot;what is that?&quot;  Well I bought the Durango that day.  I drove it and loved it.  This vehicle was unlike anything else I had ever driven.  The vehicle drove like a car with nice pick up and handling.  There was plenty of room in the front seats and back seats.  The cargo area was great.  My friend had an Explorer, and when he and I sat in the front seat our shoulders nearly touched.  I sat in the Durango and the room was great.  The features that came standard are outstanding.  My truck came with some upgrades, bigger tires, fender flairs, fog lamps etc.

At first I thought this was great, all this room all this power awesome.  then I realized that with a 70 total mile commute each day that I was filling the 25 gallon gas tank too frequently.  At 12-13 mpg, this vehicle is not economic.  The breaks have also had to be replaced already once.  I have also had to put new tire on it.  I don't know if this is inherent to SUV's but the Goodyear Wrangler tire wore down fast.  I am not a heavy footed driver.

I am also starting to show some corrosion around the outside bottom of the windows behind the rubber molding.  After only three years I have rust???  HHHMMMMMMM.

This vehicle is not good for long commutes only because of the gas mileage, if you are willing to pay then it is fine.  The ride is very comfortable as are the seats.<br><br>
