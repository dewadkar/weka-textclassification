            After I decided I would hold off on buying the (insert favorite sports car here) I was looking for the all around compromise vehicle  for my tastes.  Sporty w/ sufficient power, nice enough that business partners and family would nod in approval, from a company known for reliability, at a price that wouldn't leave me living in a cardboard box.

I'm very happy with my choice.  Its fairly luxurious and very roomy for a sports sedan (everyone, even my tall friends, always comment that they are surprised how much foot and head room there is for the passengers).

Here's a couple big plusses for me: A full size spare! and 50K mile drivetrain warranty.........

I like the style, the smoothness and class it brings to the sports sedan...I make a lot of 3 to 6 hour road trips, and am always quite comfortable.  The power is adequate enough (though as the sports car fan one always wants more!).  Probably the biggest negative is the handling (again from a sports enthusiast)  the ride is smooth at all times, but the steering is a bit slow to respond, and gets a bit soft when turning sharply.  Though there is a cure for that too! Toyota racing division has some very nice springs and struts to add stability and make the package complete.  If buying the car stock, deinitely get the sports package (w/ the 16 inch tires).  I opted for cloth seats instead of leather, but everyone is different on that issue.

I should admit that I've always been a toyota fan (I've owned two celica-GT's), but I was again pleased and impressed with what Toyota's done with this one...to &quot;borrow&quot; from the competition..This isn't your mother's Camary!<br><br>
