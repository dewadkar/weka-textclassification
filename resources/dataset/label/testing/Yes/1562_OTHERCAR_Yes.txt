            I drive a 1995 Caravan with the 6-cylinder engine.  I traded a 1989 Caravan with the 4-cylinder engine for it.  I was satisfied with the 1989 model, but it had just over 100,000 miles on it, and some of the front end components were wearing out.  

After some irritating malfunctions while the 1995 Caravan was young, it has settled down to be a good, dependable vehicle.  Here in New Mexico, we have some truly awful roads, and the van has been very forgiving when we drive on them.  It handles well on gravel roads, on dirt roads, and even on snow-covered roads.  It starts immediately now, after five years and 112,000 miles.  I like to think it will hold together for another 80,000 miles or so.

The best points of the vehicle are its comfort and handling, and that there is plenty of room for my 6'3&quot;, nearly 300 pound body, yet it is also comfortable for my 5'4&quot; wife to drive.  Economy is superb for a vehicle this size, yielding 24-27 miles per gallon tank after tank after tank.  Even with that economy, the vehicle is also comfortable on long trips, and one can sit at the wheel four up to eight hours or so without the feeling that you're sitting on a coconut.

The car is not perfect.  An irritating malfunction with the automatic locking mechanism on the side door has defied the dealer's efforts to repair.  We learned to live with it.  Now that it's older, the automatic transmission is getting a little cranky in the cold.  Since winter temperatures drop into the single digits (ï¿½F.) at night, one has to be patient with morning warm-up.  Otherwise, though, I have no major complaints.

Barring any major redesign of the Dodge Caravan, I fully intend to buy another one when my present one wears out.<br><br>
