            If you are considering a 1996 Plymouth or Dodge mini-van, pay a little more and get a 1998 or later.  We owned a 1996 Plymouth Grand Voyager for 2 1/2 years before selling due to frequent (warranty) repairs.  Our 1998 replacement has many changes that you will not find in the manual, and but for one or two minor problems, most everything wrong with the 1996 was changed.  The 1996 models are good examples of the rule, never buy the first year or two of a new model car.

The 1996 was brought in 25 times to repair about 12 different defects. The most common problem were noise related: creaks from the unitbody frame below the fire wall, squeaking plastic molding behind the sliding doors, wind noise around doors, drivers and front passenger seats would creak and &quot;pop&quot; during stops. The plastic exterior &quot;dash&quot; below the windshield wipers warped.  Paint pealed on lower rocker panels.  Radiator fan relay cut out keeping fan on at all times (this became a recall). Electric door locks faled, could not open sliding door.  Electric window motor failed, could not open/close drivers window.

Our 1998 had many improvements that you don't read about in the manuals. For example, for door wind noise, what was a three piece rubber seal was now one piece, keeping wind out of the joints.  The plastic dash was redesigned.  The plastic interior parts were joined to metal much more firmly.  I can not attest to why these things were all better, but from the ones I could see, I could tell they re-engineered and re-designed the small problems to make a much better vehicle.

Our advice is if you are looking for a used van, go for the 1998 Dodge or Plymouth, avoid the 1996 and 1997 years.  When we brought our 1996 in for repairs over those two years, we saw van after van lined up for warranty repairs.  Now, we've been by the dealer about four times in two years with out 1998 model, and we just don't see the vans lined up anymore like before.  

Both our 1996 and 1998 have been great handling, stylish, good gas MPG (3.3 engine gets about 24 highway, 15 mixed).  From a performance angle, assuming all repairs are done, this van has been great.  Both of our vans were loaded, including rear heat/Air and towing package (not used for towing but gives you better cooling system, brakes, etc. 

Rear A/C is needed; it works great, and remember, it gives rear heat too!

You may wish to consider investing $60 in the hood deflector from the dealer, it's easy to install and keeps debris from chipping the front hood.<br><br>
