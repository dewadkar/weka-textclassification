            I have recently just got a 2003 Hyundai accent in silver.  I got the automatic because I live in a big city and it would be a hassle to drive a stick.  I got the bare pkg. which turned out not to be so bare at all.  I have air conditioning, which works great; better than my husbands, who drives a $35,000 car, and had to pay extra for his air.
Whom ever says the radio with Cass. is extra, is lying. you can get it without one but it comes standard so you should just take it.  
The seats are very comfortable.  The lumber support is amazing, and being a short girl, I really appreciate the height control.  And, I will never drive another car without the arm rest. 
This car does not in anyway look like a $10,000 car.  It is sleak and has body color moldings, mirrors, and door handles.  I like that my 3 door doesn't look like a hatchback.  
I do have one minor problem with the car, and that is, that it is a little slow on pick-up.  I hoped that for a small car it would be a little bit more peppy because it is such a light car.  But don't get me wrong, it gets me where I want to go and is great for highway driving. Once you get the car up to 65 you can really wiz around in it.
I also recommend the extended warranty.  With this, they install an alarm in your car, even if you don't have power door locks, which I don't.  And they bump up your 5 year bumper to bumper to ten years and you'll also get ten years roadside.  With five years rent a car when you get your car serviced, plus much more. I only pay an extra 14 dollars a month for this plan. 
I never think about gas.  I fill up once a week and it only costs me about 13 dollars when I pay 1.69 a gallon.  I do drive daily and I never hit empty by the end of the week.
All in all I really love my car.
