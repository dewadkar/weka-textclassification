            While I don't personally own this car, I do get the opportunity to drive it when I come home on the weekends.  My mom loves Toyota and won't drive anything else.  Thus, I inherited her 1991 Camry when she bought her new Avalon.  Well, she surely got the best end of the deal.

The Avalon is a great looking car.  But looks are only the begining.  Besides, even though many people buy a car for looks, they want a car that will drive.  The Avalon is no exception.

This car moves!  The acceleration is unbelievable!  By the time I go 60 in my Camry (and Camry's aren't bad cars), I could be going 100 in the Avalon.  Passing people is not a problem at all, either, as pick-up on the highway is great.  You can pass without a problem, even on two-lane highways travelling at relatively high speeds.

Next thing that impresses me about the Avalon is the way it steers.  Keeping control on curves and turns is done with complete ease.  The car handles turns smoothly and without hesitation, and you do not have to decelerate like you would in some cars.

Finally, this car will give you a smooth and quiet ride.  Driving on the interstate is actually peaceful, even on the horrid roads of Louisiana.  Bumps and bad roads go unnoticed under the Avalon.

About the only negative thing I can say about the Avalon is the price factor.  First of all, the initial price is a bit stiff for me, but I am a college student.  Gas mileage also isn't the best in the Avalon, so plan on spending a little extra on gas.  But overall, if you have the money, there is no reason not to buy a Toyota Avalon!<br><br>
