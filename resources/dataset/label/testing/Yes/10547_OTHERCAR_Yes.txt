            I have a 1996 Plymouth Voyager Ralleye.  It is the &quot;sport&quot; model.  I love it!

I bought it new in April, 1996�before I had kids.  Even now with 2 little ones it's great.  This is the first year with the dual sliding doors.  It makes it very easy to get the kids in and out.  My 3.5 year old can now open the doors himself and climb in.

I love the way the car drives�even now that it is 4.5 years old.  The turning radius is better than my previous car (1989 Mazda 626).  It is very comfortable for short and long drives, although for long drives I wish I had gotten the Grand Voyager.  We have to pack carefully to get all of our &quot;stuff&quot; in.  

I get about 19-20 miles/gallon.

I have had some problems with the van.  I just spent $800 to fix a leaky transmission.  Also, the windshield wipers have a mind of their own when the weather gets cold.  They stop and start when they want to, not when I want them to.  I have had an $80 switch replaced once�which worked for awhile.  I'll do it again only when the wipers refuse to turn on when I want them to.

Overall, it's a great van.  I will consider buying another one in 2002.
