            I have a 1997 Kia Sportage EX.  And have to say, for what I paid for this SUV I am more than satisfied.  I havent had any problems beyond your normal wear and tear.  I also live in an area where I see all elements of weather and from rain to snow to heat, my sportage has always done right by me.  The only problem I hate about my car is what a hassle it is to get into the back of the vehicle!  They really need to rethink that one!  But overall a very good car to me!<br><br>
