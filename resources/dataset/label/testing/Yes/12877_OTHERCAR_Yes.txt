            There's little to complain about- maybe the trunk...too small- other than that small flaw this car is absolutely! without a doubt! the most wonderful vehicle I've ever owned, and there have been many- all flavors and colors. The sweet, clean lines are more like a work of art than a hard working, easy driving, reliable means of transportation. The interior is luxurious and comfortable and the sound system without compare. Am I raving?  YES. I am absolutely smitten with this car and it broke my heart when they quit making them. It handles beautifully in town and on the highway and on long empty stretches it's hard not to push it to the limits because it just hugs the road. It is so responsive you just never worry about getting into tight spots. Visibility is good all around. One word of caution, don't give this car to a teenager- it's just too much power to put in a new driver's hands. Let them work up to it!  <br><br>
