            The Mustek G-Smart 350 is a wonderfuly rugged, well-designed digital camera from the Tiwanese company know for inexpensive optical equipment. To start, the battery life is insane. Most digital cameras eat batteries. The GSmart has not yet needed to be replaced in months. And it comes with 4 AA batteries included, though it only needs 3 to run the device. The controls are basic point-and-shoot, though I found the flash on/off a little cumbersome. Instead of a large LCD panel or optical photoline up, it uses a tiny one, and it is maginfied by the view finder. It is fairly nice. Not good, but again, for the price.  It has a tiny, 500k internal memory, but that's not a problem. More on that later. The image quality is, eh, bland. Not perfect. I found it took beautiful daytime shots, but at night, it got real bad real quick, even with the flash. My shots at my brother's outdoor graduation were fine - inside the dark resturant afterwards though, it was less so.  The manual was thin, just a fold-up, and it was also given to you on the CD as a PDF. I only looked at it once, to figure out how to turn on the flash.

Now to how this camera REALLY shines. First, it's cross-platform. It works just as well on my SysteMax Win98 laptop as it does on my iMac(although the photoediting software it includes is PC only, but iMacs come with Kai's Photo Goo and other software is inexpensive). Then the second shining star of this - USB hookup. The sub-300$ market is almost exclusively PC serial, the USB hookup is a godsend for those of us on Macs, or don't have a free serial port. And a USB cable is included. Note it's ONLY USB, so if you buy this, have a  free port, or buy a hub as well. Lastely, this camera shines with a feature most sub-150$ cameras don't offer - memory expantion. You can slide any size flash media card into the slot, and get tons more storage. You can find 8 meg cards in the ~28$ range. No problem for most people, and if it is, you can get smaller ones(4 meg) on eBay for insane prices(I paied about 12 dollars for one). You will have no problem on that front.

To wrap it up. Sturdy, good looking design, good features, medicore pictures. If you want to try digital photography before buying a 600$ camera, I'd for sure go into this one. If names like Sony or Konica come up when you think Digital, better head for greener pastures.<br><br>
