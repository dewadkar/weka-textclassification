            I own a 1992 Nissan Pathfinder. It is probably the best vehicle I have ever owned. It has almost 100,000 miles on it and it still runs like I bought it yesterday. I am currently in the process of thinking of buying a 2001 model Pathfinder since I love my 1992. It is great on road and off road. It has been to hell and beyond. I have the 31x10.5 tires on it and have yet to get it stuck in the mud or in the snow. 

The only thing I do not like about it is the leather interior. It gets hot in the summer. The sunroof is very nice. (It's more of a moonroof.) The gas mileage could be better but I am not complaining about 24 miles on the highway. 

It drives very comfortable on the road. However with the large tires it makes some road noise, that you get over real soon.

Anyone in the market should consider a Pathfinder, whether it be new or used.<br><br>
