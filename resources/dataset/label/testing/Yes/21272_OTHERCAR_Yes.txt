            Personally, Toyotas are the only car for this household. Toyotas are the best reliable car on the market for the money. Sure, you might have to pay more for the car in the beginning, but you will save the money in the long run on repairs and maintenance. 

I have a 1992 Toyota Camry with 215,000 miles that runs like it was brand new. Every one that sees the car or rides in the car can not believe the mileage of the car. 

There has been only two minor unscheduled repairs. Once to replace the manifest exhaust and once to replace the air conditioner cooling unit. The car still has the original alternator, air compressor and back brakes which would have been replaced on other cars, besides Toyotas. I would have the recommend this vehicle for anyone who needs an extremely reliable car that needs to last many years.

I love driving this smooth riding, roomy car. The back seat is as roomy and comfortable as the front. A Camry would be considered for my next vehicle, oh, say in about five years or so.<br><br>
