            After leasing for years, my last vehicle being a Malibu, I decided on the Impala because of the modest price, variety of options available, comfort of ride and handling, and availability.  I drive to work every morning more than 45 miles.  I needed a car that would handle well in the snow, the Impala is front wheel drive and handles well in most weather conditions.  The ride is unsurpassed in comfort, reliability, and convenience for the price.  Maintenance is minimal, this is a &quot;worry free&quot; car with which I have had no problems.  Well, I did get stopped by a police officer the first night I drove it because it is so quiet and has great pick up, I didn't realize I was speeding.  Most options are included in the base price.  The doors automatically lock when the car is put into gear, this gives a very secure feeling in case one would forget to lock the doors.  The audio system sounds great and  control is within easy reach while driving, without being distracting.<br><br>
