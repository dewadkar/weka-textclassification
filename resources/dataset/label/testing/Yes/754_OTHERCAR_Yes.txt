            This is a classic car which will only appreciate in value as it gets older.  The handling is extremely good and feels much like a Farrarri.  For extra grip on the road, drivers can purchase racing tires specially made for this car which, although are a little pricey, can really make you feel like you're actually in a car race as you zip around tight corners.  Because of the fact that it is an Acura, it shares the characteristic of all Hondas in that it is low maintenance.  It has a very fast acceleration and has a top speed of over 200km/h.  The only downsides to this car are:
1)The extremely small trunk due to the large engine
2)The fact that you almost have to crawl in and out, until you get used to it, because of how low it sits.
3)you absolutely cannot drive this car in the winter
But all in all, Pontiac was wrong, if there is any car which is truly built for drivers, this is it.  <br><br>
