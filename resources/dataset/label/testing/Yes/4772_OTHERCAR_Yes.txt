            Wow! This car has an outstanding body that just makes you fall in love with. Comes fith standard dual and side airbags. A 1.8 liter four cylinder turbo engine runs this little baby and gives it its speed. But if you are looking for speed, you should go with the optional 2.8 liter V-6 engine. Has 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive available, and fix costs on the car are fairly cheap. Audi also covers all maintenance for the first 50,000 miles on their cars so it makes all repairs at no cost to you the owner. if you love this car but need something bigger, you should check out the Avant wagon which is basically and Audi A4 wagon. You should go out and test drive this car when you get the chance. <br><br>
