            Good Points:

Very good quality images captured with this camera.  Even on medium 1 resolution (1600 x 1200) and fine compression (giving approx 50 images per 32Mb Compact Flash Card) you can zoom in to see minute detail.  The 3x optical zoom gives the equivalent of approx 28mm - 100mm zoom lens, fantastic for a camera this size.  Further 11x digital zoom gives reasonable quality on high res settings.  

For those of you who are wet film purists dabling with digital photography (myself included!) this product has enough features to keep you interested.  ISO speed is adjustable as well as exposure compensation.  Long shutter is availible (similar to shutter priority).  There is a clever little function that adjusts the white balance according to the light source used.  There isn't a dedicated aperture priority function which can make it tricky to get your depth of feild sorted out, but lets face it, that isnt really what this camera is for.

My favourite part was the seamless integration with iPhoto on Mac OS X computers.  No need to load any of the software provided (although I'm sure its fine), just connect and go.  Use image capture to decide which images to download.

Did I mention the size, tiny!  great to take places where an SLR would be a pain in the backside.

Bad Points:

Nothing wrong with the camera really.  It is slightly annoying that zoom has to be preselected for the movie mode and is then unchangeable during shooting.  Minor point, this is a digital still camera, not a camcorder.   The camera soft case is sold separately, strange but true.

I guess the only other bad thing is it only comes with a 32Mb CFC, however this is the standard size to be included with any digital compact so it isnt really an issue when you are comparing products.

Overall:

Top stuff!
