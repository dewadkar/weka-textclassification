            I did not know what to expect when I went to test drive the new 2000 Acura Integra Coupe.  I had always known that Acura�s were a good car that could be relied upon year after year, but I was not sure how the car actually drove.  After test-driving a GS-R I was not entirely impressed.  The car did not fulfill my expectations.

<b>Engine</b>
The Acura Integra comes in three different models.  Both the LS and GS come with a 1.8-liter, V4 engine that produces about 140 hp.  The higher end GS-R also comes with a 1.8 liter, V4 but includes Acura's VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system that produces about 170 hp.  If you don't know what the VTEC system is, don't worry, all you need to know is that it allows the car to go a lot faster with basically the same size engine.

As I mentioned earlier, I test drove the GS-R because I wanted to see what the higher end model was capable of.  Overall, I was not entirely impressed with the Acura's performance.  In order to fully take advantage of the engine power, you must push the vehicle�s RPMs to the redline.  This is fine, but the car is a little slower at lower RPMs.  

<b>Interior</b>
I was pleased with the interior of the GS-R.  The nicest feature in my opinion was the black leather seats.  The controls are well placed and do not pose any problems to read them clearly.  The radio and air conditioning/heating controls are easy to control and access while driving.  The front seats allow plenty of room for two adults while the backseats are crapped and will not be pleasurable for two adults to ride in for long periods of time.  The GS-R I test drove did come with a sunroof, which was a nice feature.

<b>Exterior</b>
The GS-R does come with some nice exterior features that will make heads turn as you drive down the road.  The spoiler adds to the sporty ness feel of the car.  The classic round headlights are the same for the new 2000 model.  Acura has kept these the same for years now and they �make� the car�s exterior in my mind.  The 15� alloy wheels are also very sharp.  

<b>Safety</b>
The GS-R comes with standard ABS brakes, and dual front airbags.  One feature I noticed that was different from some competitors was their use of dual steel side impact beams.  Most cars are designed with only one beam but Acura has designed the new Integra with two beams.  

<b>Handling</b>
Overall I was impressed with the way the GS-R handled.  The independent double wishbone suspension ensured that the car could handle corners even at higher speeds.  The steering was tight and did not allow the car to �roll� while cornering.  This is an added bonus to the car since sometimes you might get in trouble with the added horsepower while cornering.

<b>Reliability</b>
Acura is one car that is known for their quality.  Their cars keep their value after they are sold and even if you plan on selling the car after a few years, the car should keep its value.  Reliability is considered better then average by most car publications.

<b>Price</b>
The GS-R I drove was about $24,000.  Depending on the features you want this price could be higher or lower.  The model I drove had a couple additional features so this price was somewhere in the middle of the price range.  The lower end models start at around $18,000.
