            With a baby on the way and a wife needing a safe car, my only option was to turn to Saturn.  Inside the dealership was a Saturn with a cutaway view of the safety features.  This impressed me.  There are reinforcements everywhere, and with safety as my number one concern, I felt at ease looking at these cars.  My wife didn't want a large vehicle, so I looked at the SL models.  Previously having owned a Saturn SL2, I knew these were reliable vehicles.  I also knew that my wife would want a car that looked good and was &quot;in fashion&quot;.  For a little under $9,000, I was able to purchase a two year old, automatic Saturn SL1.  This car looked brand new.  When I brought it home, my wife loved it.  Now, a year later, it still looks new, and two children have given it the works.  The upholstery is so easy to clean, and the exterior shines with just a washing.  This car goes everywhere, and has not given us one problem. Under the hood, the car looks like it just came from the factory.  We get excellent gas milage, and this car has got spunk!  When I take it in for service, the Saturn staff is so friendly, and always do a wonderful job.  In the waiting area, there's a comfy couch, television, a phone, and coffee with snacks.  This to me is above and beyond expectations.

Let me talk about my old Saturn, which is a 1994 SL2 - This car is still running like it did when I bought it.  I haven't had one single problem. I was in two accidents, and my car received no damage besides paint marks from the other car, which easily buffed out.  This car is a manual transmission, fully loaded vehicle - every feature works like it did when I bought it.  

Overall, Saturn is a very reputable dealer with great cars!  I will be buying more, I'm sure! <br><br>
