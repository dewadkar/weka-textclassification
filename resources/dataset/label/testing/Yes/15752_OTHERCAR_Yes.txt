            I have just received this camera this week (you can also check out my review of the S30, I returned the S30 for this camera to get more resolution). It takes amazing pictures! I just took a picture of a sea turtle at the Boston Aquarium and printed it at 8"x10" on my new Canon S750 printer. I could not tell the difference between that picture and another 8"x10" that I have from a film camera! 

Ergonomics: The camera is actually well designed. The size shape and buttons are great! I do wish for the camera to be thinner, but that would probably result in a softer pictures and more lens distortion. This camera has a duller finish than the S30 (which I like because it makes it less conspicuous) and the buttons and slide cover seems tighter than on the S30. I feel like the build quality is higher on the S40 than the S40.

Features: This has almost all the features in my Rebel 2000 SLR film camera. Including Exposure Lock, Aperature Priority, Shutter Priority, and Full manual. It also has 3 AutoFocus and Exposure Zones that can be set as Auto or Manual. The only thing that I found bad was the manual focus, but what do you expect from such a small camera. I really like the high speed continuous shoot mode which takes pictures at ~ 1.5-2.5 fps. 

Image Quality: So far so good. No artifacts. Color is rich but not oversaturated. One thing I really liked about the camera is the low lag time (the time between autofocus and the picture actually being shot). It also has very low shot to shot time due to an excellent memory buffer. I state this because of the slowness of most digital cameras. The resolution is very high (@ 4 megapixels) and one can zoom in on the photos in a photo viewer and still maintain usable images. 

Build Quality: The body seems pretty solid, except for the screen. The little LCD screen is exposed to the elements. I definately recommend a case for the camera. The Canon leather or nylon case is excellent and cheap. 

Conclusion: Get this camera! Unless you need you are on a budget (get the S30 which is the same camera but has a 3 MP CCD and $100 less) or interchangeable lens (get a digital SLR). This camera is fast, compact, great features, and takes excellent pictures.
