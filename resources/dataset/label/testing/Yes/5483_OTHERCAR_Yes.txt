            I got my GM Mastercard 8 years ago when they were a fairly new concept.  My family and friends were reluctant, but I stuck with it.  I soon upgraded to the Gold card, so I could earn more points per year, and keep them for more years.  7 years later, in 8/99, I got my first NEW car!  The sticker price was about $16,000 because of several upgrades.  I got to knock $5000 off with the GM rebates from the Mastercard.  My husband and I debated lease or own, and decided to lease.  (That's a whole topic in itself though!)

So what do I like about my car?  Other than really low lease payments on a new car?  The Prizm is exactly the same car as the Toyota Corrolla.  It is made of the same parts, assembled at the same factory.  They just slap a different tag on it.  Everyone knows Toyota is reliable, so right away, I felt good about that. And I paid several thousand less than my sister, who bought a Corrolla a couple years before. I like the gas efficiency, the comfort, and the style.  For a small car, it has pretty good &quot;get up and go&quot; thanks to the overdrive, even on the automatic.  The air conditioner works blissfully. And, as slight as it may seem, there are 3 well placed cup holders, which fit nearly any container (more than I can say for the Jetta!)

If I had to complain, it would be that the windshield defrost is quite slow.  Also, within a year, the driver sun visor broke, and it took about 2 months to get a replacement from the dealer.  

All in all, I'm really pleased with this car.  I will most likely trade it in for an '02 when the lease is up.  Its very affordable and runs great.  <br><br>
