            love the camera, it's light weight and easy for me to use.  I have been able to enjoy the Olympus D-340R camera without feeling over-loaded with alot of equipment that I don't need or understand. It was great to have this on the last two trips that I have taken recently.  I didn't feel like I had to be bothered with alot of unwanted accessories, I could more or lesss justs point and click.  It was great to be able to enjoy my recent trips with a camera I felt comfortable with and not feel like I was clumpsy and fidgety like it were some gadget.<br><br>
