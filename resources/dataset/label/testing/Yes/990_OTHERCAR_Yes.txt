            The Toyota Matrix is a car designed for those of us who want the space and convenience of an SUV while still worrying about things like price and gas mileage.  And this model delivers!  The ride is fun, the look is great, and the interior space is wonderful.  Since the back seats go down flat, there's an incredible amount of storage space (more, in fact, than many SUVs).  And it's easily useable space, as well.

I have a few minor complaints.  I have about average-size feet for a women (size 7), and the gas pedal seems a little further off the floor of the car than I prefer.  Sometimes it almost feels as if I don't have full control over the pressure on the pedal.  And the driver's side seat is sometimes a little uncomfortable.

For anyone used to a sedan, the sight lines are terrible.  Between the distance to the back and back side windows and the back seat headrests, it's very difficult, sometimes, to get a good idea of what's behind and to the sides of you.  I have to be very careful when changing lanes or backing up.

I'd also advise anyone getting a Matrix to invest in automatic locks.  Because the locks are recessed into the doors and not available as pop-up locks, it's very difficult to manually unlock other doors from inside the car.
