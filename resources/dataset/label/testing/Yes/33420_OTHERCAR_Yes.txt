            I bought a 99 Jetta last year in April.  I bought it brand new, and I still love my car.  I just think that it has the right amount of sportiness and appeal, and it is still pretty affordable.
I did a lot of research in looking for a car, and I have to hand it to Volkswagon, they surely know how to advertise.  I was hooked on Jettas from the first ad up until I purchased my car.
My only negative has been dealing with the dealership.  Sometimes I question whether they really know what they are doing.  I didn't feel like I was taken advantage of, but it was because I really researched the car on my own.
I really recommend this car.  It is fun, it looks good, and I have had no problems with mine.  I definitely recommend getting the 6 CD-changer and also the sunroof.  I have decided I can't live without either.
