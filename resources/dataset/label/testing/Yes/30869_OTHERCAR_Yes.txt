Introduced in the 1999 model year, the Suzuki Grand Vitara has driver and passenger airbags plus dual-locking shoulder belts. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has evaluated the crashworthiness of the Grand Vitara, based primarily on performance in a 40 mph frontal offset crash test into a deformable barrier. Head restraint and bumper designs are evaluated separately: 
STRUCTURE/SAFETY CAGE: ACCEPTABLE There was minimal intrusion into the driver footwell area and minimal rearward movement of the instrument panel. However, the A-pillar moved rearward, the roof rail bent sharply, and the occupant space was compromised by buckling under the driver seat and center console.

RESTRAINTS/DUMMY KINEMATICS: ACCEPTABLE Dummy movement was reasonably well controlled. The driver door bowed outward and, during rebound from the airbag, the dummy moved up and toward the driver door, contacting the roof rail in front of the B-pillar. 

INJURY MEASURES: HEAD/NECK ACCEPTABLE Measures taken from the neck, chest, and both legs during the offset test indicate low risk of injury to these body regions. Forces on the head when it loaded the airbag were moderately high, but head acceleration from the roof rail contact was low.

OVERALL EVALUATION: ACCEPTABLE The driver space was maintained reasonably well in the frontal offset crash test. However, forces on the dummy's head were moderately high, indicating the possibility of injury.
