            I purchased this product for two reasons, The first of which was being able to sell stuff on eBay and the second was being able to send pictures to my family out of state. I was really frustrated every time I tried to list an auction on eBay, I would take pictures of my product and then have to run to the one hour photo shop and half the time the pictures were two poor to use. This camera can focus on small objects and will give you exceptional quality. It's really great that I was able to send pictures of my house with Christmas lights to my Dad via e-mail. I went out snapped the picture, came in put the disk in my computer and sent the picture out, no time spent. It's great! I have had great luck with the pictures I have used on eBay, and it is great fun to send pictures across the web to my friends and family. <br><br>
