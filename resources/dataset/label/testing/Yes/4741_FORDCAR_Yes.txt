            Mechanically, I couldn't be happier with my Mustang GT coupe. In the 3+ years and 40,000 miles I've owned it, it has been to the shop twice for the check engine light (repairs covered by warranty), once for a new serpentine belt, and once for a new throwout bearing. Can't complain about any of that. I've been to the tire shop more times than I'd like (just got my 3rd set today), and the thing sucks down coolant, but that's about all I can complain about. This is a reliable car.

This ain't no Honda - you aren't going to get 50 mpg. It's a sports car with a big engine. Deal with it. The power is worth the $$ you spend in gas. It doesn't score many points in the roomy department, but if you only have two in the car, like most sports cars, you can take a long trip. The ride is smooth and steady, and takes corners like a dream. It loves to stretch its legs on long, empty stretches of road.

Don't try driving it in the snow though - you'll make it to the first hill and be sorry you left the house. That's what you get for a rear wheel drive that likes to rev.
