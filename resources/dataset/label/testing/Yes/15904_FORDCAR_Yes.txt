            I currently own a 1990 Bronco 2 XL.
Purchased after the untimelly demise (read ie: i wrecked it.) of my 1988 Bronco 2 XLT.
These little SUV's are very tough and rugged for their small size.
I purchased mine because of the good towing ability / cheap 4 wheel drive /  and fuel economy.
Turns out they are very comfortable to drive as well.
(a nicely appointed, fairly roomy little truck.)
I recently got back from a 1,600 mile round trip from western NM to OK. loaded down with tools, spare parts, misc.gear, and towing a rather heavy 4'X8' trailer -w- a 350 pound off road motorcycle, fuel cans etc.
The little Bronco performed flawlessly, easily towing all this excess weight at speeds exceeding 75-80 mph.
(and returning 18-20 mpg in the process.)
The seating and controls are first rate, and made the long trip most enjoyable.
My only gripe is that mine wasnt equipped -w- cruise control. :-(
Also it could use a bit more power in high elevations.
Plenty of "grunt" in Oklahoma and Texas, but once in the "high desert" of Newmexico it got a bit sluggish.
But would still hold onto 65mph -w- not much trouble.
Of course the little trucks 2.9 liter V-6 engine is pushing over 135,000 miles, so i'll give it credit for that.
Other options are:
Automatic overdrive transmission.
Am-Fm Cassette.
Air Conditioning.
Rear window wiper-defroster.
3.73 differential.
Roof luggage rack.
Swing away spare.
Factory bumper hitch.
Auto locking hubs.
Aluminum alloy wheels. (now -w- P235-75-15 tires.)
Center console.

Theitems replaced or repaired so far are:
LH front hub.
Starter motor.
fuel pump.
Driveshaft-CV joints.

Was it worth the purchase?
Most definatley, and i intend on keeping it for a long time to come.
My only big problem is that they dont make these fine little beasts anymore.
So when the day comes to say goodbye to my little red B2, i will be out there looking for another good used one.
The good news is that that will probably be a long long time from now.  ;-)
