            When Honda released the Honda Civic Si in 1999 I knew they had a winner.  I owned a 1996 Honda Civic EX Coupe for two years and my only complaint was a little lack of power.  Honda saw this lack of power and raised the bar from 127 hp to 160 hp out of the 1.6 liter double overhead cam four cylinder.  These 160 hp in the new Civic Si jump to life with an exciting VTEC engine.  This VTEC system allows the car to rev freely all the way to a unbelievable 8000 rpm.  The VTEC system goes through a cam shift at 5500 rpm to give an additional 18 instant hp.  This translates to a relatively quick 7.0 seconds flat run to 60 mph, while still managing almost 30 mpg around the city.  This car produces 100 hp per liter, an output level normally saved for sports cars like Ferraris.  The Honda Civic Si is known around the motorsports world as a car that can handle great, straight from the factory.  The four wheel double wishbone suspension eats up both bumps and corners with glee.  A stock front strut tower brace helps remove some of the body roll during tough handling.  
     Overall, this car is the bang-for-the-buck champion in the pocket rocket segment.  Comfort, style, speed, handling, and good old Honda reliabilty make this car a wonderful purchase.  The Civic Si is available in three colors, red, black, and electron blue(which is a head turner).  Si's are only available mated to a 5 speed transmission, so automatic lovers won't love the shifting.
     This car is a great purchase for anybody who enjoys driving and likes having money, not spending it fixing your car or paying high monthly payments.  Driving this vehicle is wonderful, but the lack of torque translates to having to rev the engine higher than on most cars.  The seats could have a touch more lumbar support and anti-lock brakes would be nice, but Honda did upgrade the brakes to disc at all four wheels.
     I just wanted to let the readers of Epinion.com know that I just turned 30,000 miles on my Civic Si with absolutely no repair expenses.  I have been on numerous road trips and been to multiple track events.  This car is the real deal on handling.  With stock tires this car can eat up a race track or gobble up some mountain twisties. So, if you are ready to have some fun driving and still want to keep your conservative appearance, this is your car.  Thanks Honda for putting the fun back into driving without breaking the bank!
