            November 24th my wife and I leased a 2000 Saturn LS1 based entirely on the performance we got from the first Saturn we purchased in 1997, an SL2. This vehicle was originally purchased so my wife would have a dependable vehicle to drive to work, 40-miles one-way. When we traded it in last week, it had 42,000 miles on it and was in excellent condition, but we wanted the new Saturn because it was bigger. Our '97 was as good as Saturn said it would be, if not better, and we managed to get 27mpg. We NEVER had a problem with it and the dealership (Saturn of Watertown, Ct) was the easiest I have ever experienced, and I've been buying cars for 49-years! Both the Tennessee manufacturer and the local dealership were continually in contact with us over the 2-years with updates and notices on the new cars. I've NEVER had such customer care as I got from Saturn. As I said, the only reason we traded it in was to get into the bigger (and newest) version of Saturn. We never even considered trading it in for another make (Chevy, Ford, Chrysler, etc.) and even though the new car has only 500-miles on it (as I write this), the improvements made by Saturn in 2-years were surprising to me. The 4-cylinder engine is peppier than the 1997 model and, while we're still breaking it in with mostly local driving, we're getting 25-to-26 mpg. The transmission is smoother than the '97...the ride is much more firm because they improved the suspension... the car is roomier than the SL2 we owned...and it really is a pleasure to drive it. We love everything about it, EXCEPT the placement of the seat belt lock-in. That's the only improvement I would suggest be made. The Saturn is ideal for us and my wife and I will never consider another car manufacturer than Saturn based on these past 3-years ownership. If anyone wants to get more information on our experience with Saturn, you may write briandow@yahoo.com. NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS AN UPDATE*************         We've just passed 1100 miles since we leased this 2000 Saturn and NOTHING has occurred since we drove out of the dealership with the new car that would make me want to have re-considered our decision on Saturn. We have yet to take an extended trip, with the exception of going to Boston once from our Connecticut home (300-miles round trip), and 90% of our driving is short trips within 10-t0-15 miles at a time. Our locan MPG has increased slightly and averages about 26MPG...but the Boston trip saw it increased to 30MPG using cruise control. This is almost exactly what the sticker estimate said it would be, and we're still really breaking it in! I have had absolutely NO problems with this new car and find it as comfortable as any car we've ever owned. Since our lease began November 24th, the dealership has called me at least 3-times to follow-up my &quot;likes or dislikes&quot; about the car...but I have nothing to complain about. Dealing with Saturn is everything they say it is...a new and worthwhile experience and I have 2-neighbors who own Saturns who spotted our new car and came to look at it. They, too, are very impressed and I wouldn't be surprised to see 2-more 2000 Saturns in my neighborhood!!!!!<br><br>
