            My wife and I went car shopping last weekend.  The vehicles to make the short list were the Mercedes-Benz SLK230 (likely we'd buy used), BMW Z3 Coupe 3.0i (this is what we purchased) and the Audi A4 1.8t quattro with a manual transmission (obviously,  I hope for your sake).

Any of these three vehicles would make almost anybody a very happy happy happy driver and the envy of their friends and neighbours (unless you live in Beverly Hills, which we don't).  In my opinion one of the advantages of the Audi is that to the average person it just looks like a nice car, while they other two scream "I'm rich" (which may or may not be true).  However, if you're looking for an outrageous-looking, intensely fun car in an extroverted sort of way, this isn't it.

The Audi's interior is simply beautiful.  We'd almost purchased a '99 avant a couple years ago until the dealer told us it would take 3 months to order what we wanted from Germany.  As our '86 Honda Civic had been totalled (hit by an underaged drunk driver as it sat broken on the side of the freeway overnight - thank you God!!) and we were driving my boss' '85 El Camino, we weren't about to wait 3 months for a vehicle and felt if we were spending over $30k on a car we wanted it to be exactly what we wanted, so we bought a Subaru  Impreza Outback instead.  Anyway, the Audi's interior is much nicer than either the BMW or the Mercedes, which is extra cool as it costs less than either one new ($14,000 less than the Mercedes).  Of course, the Audi doesn't have a retractable hardtop, either.

The sport package gives this car very flat cornering and makes it extremely enjoyable to throw around corners.  Throw in an APR or some other chip (and risk voiding the warranty) and you'll have a fun, safe, practical, luxurious car for a lot less money than the ubiquitous (in Southern California) BMW 3-series.  And you'll have quattro.

In the end, my wife wanted a FUN vehicle and wasn't too concerned about practicality as we also have a Jeep for that.  It's her car and even though at a bit over 6'3 the BMW is very cramped for me and the Audi fits like a dream, we got the BMW.  I just reviewed that.  It makes the Audi feel like a Toyota Prius when it comes to raw speed and power, and I guess in the end that was what it was about for my wife.  It was a very tough choice for her though.
