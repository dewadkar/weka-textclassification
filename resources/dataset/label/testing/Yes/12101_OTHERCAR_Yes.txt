            Our Saab is a turbo convertible with a 5-speed transmission. It has black paint and black canvas top with tan leather interior. We bought this handsome car as a long-term investment and have not been disappointed. Our car has provided many years of extremely reliable service with absolutely no major mechanical breakdowns. This is not to say that the car has never seen the repair shop. To the contrary, our car is at the shop for every single prescribed maintenance service and also for the rare mechanical problem. We average 25-28 mpg with this car, and that is mostly freeway driving.

The most important thing a new or potential Saab owner should do is locate a GOOD (ask for some customer references) certified, independent mechanic. Our mechanic is not only reasonably priced, but he is honest and ethical (unlike the local dealership). He knows our cars and is familiar with their idiosyncrasies. Understand that your Saab will require a knowledgeable mechanic's regular maintenance-- so find a mechanic you like and trust. This form of service relationship will reward you with hundreds of thousands of miles from a very fun to drive car AND save you thousands of dollars.

Our car looks and drives excellent. The quality of the interior finish is both excellent (seats, headliner, steering wheel and switches are all excellent) and poor (door panel fabric, vinyl glove box door, dash trim could have been better quality). Overall, our interior has held up well. The convertible top mechanism operates smoothly and quietly as it should (amazing for the age of the vehicle). If you buy a convertible, keep in mind that a new top will run about $600-$1,100 installed (for an OEM top--price depends on how much of the top you replace). We just replaced our entire top for the first time, and because we plan on keeping our Saab for many more years we decided on an OEM part since the original top had proven its durability to us. Our car's black paint still holds a deep shine, although we did have the front bumper repainted at 100,000 miles due to light oxidation on the gray paint. Unknowing people think our 14 year-old Saab is just a couple years old. The exterior has held up very well. 

Major repairs to date: front suspension overhaul including driver's side upper and lower control arm (this was expensive), shocks, complete valve re-grind (we did this while the head was off to replace the main gasket/seal which was leaking), replace all vacuum lines (very inexpensive and quick preventative vacuum-leak fix), water pump with thermostat and hoses. Clutch (only once so far--and it is wasn't very expensive). Front rotors at 120,000 miles. 
Repair Summary: We haven't had a loan payment on this car in years, so I don't consider an average annual investment of one hundred to two hundred dollars in maintenance and repair to be excessive. 

I can recommend purchasing a Saab like ours without hesitation, however I would certainly be sure to review the car's maintenance history and speak to the mechanic who regularly serviced the car. Watch out for poorly maintained vehicles, as they'll likely cost a bundle to fix properly. Have your potential "new" Saab looked over by your newfound local mechanic (after all, he's going to be working on it in the future). Be careful when buying a used auto transmission car as I have been told that the transmissions are expensive to repair/replace and do not offer the life expectancy of a manual (I have never owned a Saab with an auto transmission, so this is secondhand information).
