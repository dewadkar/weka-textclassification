            I've been a technician in a chevy dealership for 12 years. the prizms have always impressed me. this is probably because they are basically a toyota corrolla. They continue to be the ONLY car i have no problem at all recommending to someone looking for a VERY reliable, economical, usable car. Next to nothing goes wrong with these cars. The only things i can tell you that you would ever have to spend money on to fix would be eventually tires, exhaust(a long while though), sooner or later brakes(50k miles easily if you aren't a racecar driver), and that's basically it. I have NEVER seen an engine problem with a prizm that wasn't caused by owner abuse,(never changing oil, or leaving the oil filter loose). The only transmission problem I see is on the automatics; the torque converter seal leaks on most of the early ones, not really on the later ones. It is usually only a minor leak which leaves a hanging drop on the lower part of the undercarriage. This is a warranty item if caught early enough. These cars are very well designed. The ride is acceptable, the power is adequate. The maintenance is simple. I'm sure they are good on gas. Fit and finish are above average for something that chevy dealer would sell. Unless you are into muscle cars or pick-up trucks, the prizm will not let you down if you are looking for a small, reliable, basic vehicle that will get you where you want to go without rattling your nerves.  <br><br>
