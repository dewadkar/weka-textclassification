            I pick up a RCA CDS1005 the other day at OfficeMax for $49 + tax. Though it would be a fun little camera to play around with and did not expect too much. Well, I was only disappointed by the flash. No fill setting and it seems to only work if the picture is not too dark? It would be better if there was a fill setting. I like the ability to adjust the exposure setting somewhat with the EV+/- and the f2.0 is good for low light. After some experimenting I found that the images produced would be equal to a cheap 35mm/APS camera. I've done darkroom work for some 25 years as a hobby so adjusting the images with Photoshop seems like the work you normally do in the darkroom to improve picture quality. I've found that if you remove the color to make the images black&white and reduce the size from 640X480 the image quality is not too bad. So for the price this would be a fun little camera to play around with. Reminds me of making pinhole camera pictures. I didn't expect much to $49 and neither should you.
