            Volkswagen's new and improved Jetta is a great car.  It is now offered in six different models.  It is not a luxury car, moderately priced, however, i feel you get more than what you pay for.  It is a great car for new drivers as well as for those old-3mph-driving-farts-who-can-barely-see-over-the-wheel-if-they-can-see-at-all. There are more options than you can imagine when purchasing the vehicle.  The heating system is grand.  And has an exceptionally roomy back for any teen planning a special date at &quot;the point&quot; to show off their stick, if you purchased one with manual transmission of course. So i recommend Volkswagen's new Jetta, its a smart buy.  Jetta is Betta.<br><br>
