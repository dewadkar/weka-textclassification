                 I bought this vehicle to replace a Dodge Grand Caravan and have been very pleased. This vehicle rides very much like a car yet has the carrying capacity of a mini-van. The interior is spacious and the controls are well placed. The seats are especially comfortable. This particular model has an automatic lumbar support which is well worth it on long trips. The rear hatch works well and cargo can be loaded and unloaded with ease.
     The gas mileage is average at best. Averaging 20 miles per gallon at best on the open road. When backing up the vision is poor especially at night. The lights come on automatically when needed but cannot be turned off when parked unless you turn off the engine. There is slight hump on the passenger side in the front seat that limit foot room on that side.
     Despite these minor problems I am still pleased with my purchase and can with only minor reservations recommend this vehicle.
