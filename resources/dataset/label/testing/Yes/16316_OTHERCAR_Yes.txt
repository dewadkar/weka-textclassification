            Under the tree this Christmas was a fine piece of Photo equipment from HP. The C200 is a true joy to own and use.

The camera is fully automatic and comes with 2X digital Zoom, full instructions, HP CD-Rom photo software, batteries, a 9 pin serial port cable and a 8 MB Compact Flash memory card. Larger cards are available at most computer stores. The included software includes an application to easily download the photos. Software titles include Ulead and Photo Explorer 4.2

The card provides for the storage of 80, 40 or 20 color pictures depending on the quality of the photo required. Using the medium setting produces 40 fine quality pictures.

The only disadvantage is that it does not come with a AC power adapter, which is a must to download the photos. This operation can be done with the batteries but you'll loose half their power in this operation alone.

HP has a AC adapter available for an additional $49.00 but you have to order if from HP's Offices. I could not fine any store that carries it locally. I believe the customer could be better served by charging more for the camera and including the adapter.
