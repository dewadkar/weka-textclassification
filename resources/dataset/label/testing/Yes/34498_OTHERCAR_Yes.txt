   I was given the opportunity the other day to drive my friends brand new Chevy s-10, and man was I impressed. The first positive thing I noticed, besides the sleek body style and gleaming paint job, was the comfortable interior. Sitting in these seats felt like you were driving your couch down the road. Also, the leather steering wheel and dash made the car seem extremely comfortable to drive.

   The aspect I was most impressed with was the raw power this truck has. There were 4 of us sitting in this truck, with the bed fully loaded too, and we were going up a pretty steep hill. This truck gave not even the slightest sign of hesitation. When you pressed on the accelerator it responded and surged right up the hill.

   This truck also has a long bed which makes it possible to load many things to go on a trip for example. The bed also sits low, so it makes it easier to load. You can fit just about anything in the back of this truck.

   Perhaps the only setback on this truck is its wide wheel base. You practically have to be on the freeway to make a u turn. You can't exactly turn on a dime. However, the truck does handle well. When you turn the steering wheel it responds.

  All in all this is one of the better trucks on the market. It's comfortable, has the power needed to travel just about anywhere, and handles well. If you're looking into buying a new truck you might want to consider the chevy s-10.
