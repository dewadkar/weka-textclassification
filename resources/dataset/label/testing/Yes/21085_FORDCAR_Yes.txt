            Most people go for the cars that go the fastest, looks the best, and cost the most $$.  But not me and my family.  We go for high quality dependable cars like the Ford Windstar.  This mini~van was meant for are family.  With seating for 7 people this is a must for any family wanting a dependable, sage, and stylish car.  The mini~van comes in so many different styles and colors I am sure that they will have the right one for you.  The Windstar I have is tan and I think might tan might be the most popular color because when ever I go out to a public place I see at least one mini~van that is identical to it.  There is plenty of room in the back of the car, in the front of the car, and in the middle of the car.  So you won't have to worry about people being squished on long drives.  There is PLENTY of room for luggage and don't worry kids...If you get to cold you can change the AC from the middle of the car.  You can also change the radio station from the middle also!  But don't worry parents you can turn that off so your children don't keep on changing your favorite station to their favorite station.  The Ford Windstar was definitly the car for me and my family.  I give it 10 stars! **********!<br><br>
