            With a newborn in the house I thought it would be nice to get mom a digital camera for Christmas.  Although I have to admit I was the one who really wanted it!  After looking around, not knowing what I was looking for I finally decided on the Toshiba PDR-M60.  For $399 the camera packed 2.3 mega pixels, 2.3x optical zoom, and a 2x digital zoom.  Comparing to other models in the stores the camera seemed to fit the bill.  
I brought the camera home, and like others got roughly 5 pictures out of the batteries supplied with the camera.  I quickly learned to keep the screen off while taking pictures, this increased the battery life dramatically.  Unlike others, I had no problems loading images into my computer via the USB cable.  The camera is simple to use, a real point an click product.  Although I did find the user manual in the box to be useless.  I found more info. online!
The pictures from this computer are stunning. The colors are vivid and the images are clear and crisp.  My only complaint is Toshiba's lack of quality in the case.  The camera looks and feels cheap.  The battery door located on the bottom of the camera, gave me the &quot;I'm going to break off on you just as the warranty is up&quot; feeling.  I returned the Toshiba  opting for my next choice the Sony DSC-S30 which seemed to be built better than the Toshiba (see my opinion on the DSC-S30), which I am now returning and upgrading to the DSC-S50, but more on that later!
My conclusion, for the beginner or intermediate user, the Toshiba is a camera worth considering.  The images are super, much better the the Sony DSC-S30, well it is of course 2.3 mega pixels compared to the 1.3 in the Sony.  But for the same price you can't beat the Toshiba!  Case in point, I am in the process of returning my Sony DSC-S30 to get the $600 Sony DSC-S50 simply because the S30 photos don't come close the the Toshiba!  If you can stand the &quot;I'm gonna break on you&quot; feeling the body on the Toshiba gives you, the camera is well worth the $399.<br><br>
