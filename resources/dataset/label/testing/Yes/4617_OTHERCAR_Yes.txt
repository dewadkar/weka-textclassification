            Well can't find my original post but anyway car came in last Monday.

Love driving this car. Much better than was expecting.
The ride is firm but not uncomfortable even during  town
driving. Optional sport seat offer good adjustment range. One
area of concern was road view as in some past corvettes you found 
yourself straining to see over the hood. Not so with 2001 seating
position is high and wheel flares do not affect side viewing.

Some road noise but its got a lot of rubber on the ground. A
family member just purchased a Lincoln LS8 and the road noise 
is about the same, maybe hard to believe but I've driven
the LS8 quite a bit. Exhaust sound does not appear to be a problem
know some people have posted on other web sites as to being
bothersome. Maybe its my C-5 but at 70 little resonance to interior.

I usually don't drive this much but hey its new, gas mileage combined
for road and town (mostly in town) has reported on computer as 21mpg. 
Still have not done any full throttle due to break in period but its
there, just 1/3-1/2 throttle  moves this car.

one problem is going to be the low front end, manual says spoiler
designed for small rises but to use common sense. My problem is 
going to be my steep driveway, not much one came do but go slow.

As for price, really nothing else available in this range, most
others would start at 50 grand  or more. If someone wants to add
to their purchase - plan a trip to Bowling Green Kentucky for a free
tour of the assembly plant. Across road is the Museum (not free)
makes an interesting day. I took reg delivery but went up to
plant to see if could catch car coming off the line, missed by 1 day.
One can also take delivery at Bowling Green for $500 extra.

Other features coming to appreciate are the Head up display which places
vital information on windshield, electronic climate control works
well, message center which list about anything could need to know
about the car. The ease entry seat could be refined a little to 
work whether you use the key fob or not. 

See little fault with car so far, audio on steering would help.
Who should buy this car, that's hard, but age should not deter 
anyone, it a fun car for the person who wants a sports car. If
one wants more detailed information visit the corvetteforum website.


Update - first long trip - On interstate driving 70-75 mph it returned
28-30 mpg. This gave a good 400  mile cruising range. Very comfortable
and as mention above minimal noise from exhaust and road. Very 
pleased with the purchase of this car. Did install a GM front Bra
which helped in protection of rock chips. Mileage is 3000  and
no problems to report.
