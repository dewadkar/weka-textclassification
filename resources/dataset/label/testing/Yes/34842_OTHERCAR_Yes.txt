            The Odyssey was a no brainer for a Honda/Acura driver of 15 years.  The engine size and transmission rules the mini-van world.   It was no surprise that this was the first van I felt really drives more like a car.  When my wife used to follow me driving my Acura in her Plymouth Voyager on a curvy road I would always dust her, especially up hills.  Now she stays right on my ass with her Odyssey.  It is lower, steers tighter, and brakes incredibly well.  The real surprise was how comfortable the ride was and how many great new features were packed in this van.  One monster feature is the rear seats that dumps all the way flat into the floor.  Beyond the obvious ease of not having to remove this seat, you have the comfort of being able to toss sleeping bags on the floor with luggage on the roof for the kids on an overnight drive.  Just don�t forget to yank that puppy up in a hurry for seat belts if you get pulled over with more than 4 on board.   The electric panel doors are going to take patience to open without frequently getting an error beep.  They hate to be rushed.  And don�t even debate with the Mrs. About those ridiculously poor speaker cones.  You need to yank em and install some decent speakers.   The dealer is going to try to ram a thousand-dollar service agreement down your throat siting the cost of replacement of 2 A/C compressors or other high cost repairs.  They may fail to mention you will rack up another couple grand in routine maintenance in order for your coverage to be valid.  Don�t forget you are driving a Honda.<br><br>
