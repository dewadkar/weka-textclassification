            No one wants to make a mistake when spending this kind of money and, thanks to the Internet, I was able to do the research on every digital camera available at the time of purchase. After narrowing selection to three models, I was able to see them &quot;in the flesh&quot; at local stores.
I feel the Epson 750Z offered the most features at the best price and after using it for a number of months am convinced that I made the right choice.

PLUS FEATURES

* Offers more features than some higher price models 
* Picture sharpness is excellent even at the lowest resolution
* Not overly bulky - will fit in a small camera bag
* Has more memory than most other models
* Have been pleased with battery life - can turn off monitor to conserve
* Solar Assist Panel can be used outdoors to power LCD screen 
* Lens optical/digital zoom equivalent to 34mm to 102mm

MINUS FEATURES
* Lots of buttons that are a little confusing at first
* A little bulky compared to some of the newer models
