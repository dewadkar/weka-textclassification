            Hey all y'all wonderful people who keep reading my reviews!  Thanks sooo much.  You guys are the best!  Well anyways I am here to give you my opinion of the 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix!  Well, I do have to admit that I only had it as a rental car but I also had it for 2 weeks so I know the Grand Prix fairly well!  Let me start by saying that it is rather cheap (as far as cars go) and would make a great car for someone fresh out of college.  It is an extremely cute little car, it runs really good, there is a very roomy trunk, and you'll have plenty of leg room in the front or the back. I would recommend it for anyone so why don'tcha take my advice and check one out ASAP!<br><br>
