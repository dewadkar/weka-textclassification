              I recently bought a 1993 Z28 with 17,000 miles.  Yes someone actually owned a Z28 for 6 years and only put 17,000 miles on it.  I am a huge camaro fan:  spending 3 years building a 1969 camaro from the ground up, and now owning a 1993 Z28 also.  I was(and still am) amazed at the overall performance of the 4th generation camaro.

  In stock trim the Z28 is able to leave slightly modified mustangs sitting at the light.  I have added a K&amp;N air filter, 3&quot; Flowmaster exhaust, and modified the shifter and I am elated at the power of the LT-1.  The seats are by far the most comfortable seats I have ever sat in.  

  The two real high points for me (besides engine performance) is the gas mileage and the overdrive.  I have gotten 31 MPG on the highway!!!  At 65 miles per hour the engine turns 1500 RPM!!!  At 110 the engine turns only 2700 RPM.  Chevrolet engineers are unbelievable.  I have never owned a vehicle in which I have liked half as much as the 4th generation camaro.  I honestly can't complain about one aspect of the camaro.  It drives like an indy car.  The steering is very tight and responsive.  The brakes are wonderful.

  I have friends that have said mustangs are soooo much smoother and faster than camaro's---UNTIL THEY DRIVE MINE.  You show me a stock mustang that can even keep up with a stock camaro.  And I venture to say that there is not a mustang on the planet (5.0 or 4.6) that has ever gotten over 30 mpg!

  If you are looking for near Corvette performance at less than half the price-BUY A Z28!!!  <br><br>
