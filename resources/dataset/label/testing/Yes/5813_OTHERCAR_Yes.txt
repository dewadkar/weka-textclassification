                 Having had a blessing of our 5th child a bit ago - we are once again taking pictures like crazy.  This presented that age old problem of undeveloped film sitting in canisters around the house until someone travelled down to the local store to get them developed (usually something like 10 to 12 rolls at a time). Of course - then you get them back and you really only want 1/2 the pictures that are there but are stuck with all of them.
     We came up with the idea of getting a digital camera so that we could use it for quick shots when the kid(s) do something cute or whatever.  Plus we could get them quicker and play with them on the computer and all. Of course - when we started looking a prices - these seemed a bit steep for a second (dare I say spare) camera.
     Thus came a couple of weekends ago when the local CompUSA has a special deal on the 490Zoom camera. A coworker had recommended the Olympus brand and that has been the one that I had been favoring. When I saw the $349.00 ($299 with rebate) price I was impressed and ran out to get on because "QUANTITIES WERE LIMITED".
     Picked up the camera (one of the better store experiences I have had) and got a $50 rebate and a slip for a free USB reader by mail. The unit dows come with a serial cable attachement to download pictures but this is slow - espeically if you have a large media card. It was suggested by the sales person that I pick up rechargable batteries for the unit since it was well known that these cameras eat batteries.
     Got home and imediately started playing - of course avoiding the instrution book as is required in the tech support person's code book.
     Got the batteries in, flipped open the lens cover and started playing with the menu settings. Having no clue what most of the selection meant - I set up the camera for the first try. The first try was actually the next day at the local Memorial Day parade. Well - needless to say - the first run was rather poor - I had the exposure set to inside and I was shooting outside and all. I was impressed that the picutures turned out as well as they did - however they had a serious blue haze to them.
     The camera came with a 8 MB Media Card - enough to take 16 pictures at my exposire - HQ at 1.5 megapixels.  To go to the max 2.1 megapixels - you get a couple pictures at most from the 8 meg card. There are upgrade cards up to 256 MB with prices going up accordingly. Fortunately they seem to go on sale quite frequently and there are numerous manufacturers of the media.
     The second run of pictures was much better. I took the time to study the selections and set things up properly this time (still no manual - however I did use it to see where the strap attached to).  These pictures turned out much better - and printed quite nicely on a Color Laser Printer - even on regular non glossy paper.
     The camera performs nicely.  The zoom is nice - not the range of a standard camera but the digital/optical combination pretty much takes care of anything I need. Takes some getting used to since there are two pressures on the button to take the photo with. Press it halfway to sort of freeze and review the picture and all the way to take the shot. I actually missed two pictures at the parade because I did not press the button down enough.
     As for the afore mentioned battery problem - I have taken about 32 shots thus far and the batteries that came with the camera are still fine. I am sure that they will die in a bit and proably when I need them most. I was a little surpised that the strap for the unit attached to a thin wire that makes up the hinge for the media card slot. Seems a bit weak for the purpose but it seems to work.
     The camera is a bit heavy as I said but nothing serious. To turn it on you slide the lens cover out of the way and turning it off is by pushing the cover back (basically into the extended lens). THe falsh you have to lift manually to activate - seems kind of odd since the lesser expensive models has a build in flash but whatever.
     Overall the camera has performed well. Picures are good and other than my exposure problem - have a nice quality when printed and viewed on the computer. I just signed up for ofoto so I have yet to see a developed picture from this unit yet but ones I have seen from silimiar models have been excellent.
     THe Olympus 490Zoom did exactly what I wanted it to - gave me the chance to have a (I guess you could say spare) camera that I can grab and use for spur of the moment photos and things that I can share electronically. We still use out regular camera as well (not nearly as often thought) but the 490 has definately solved the file laying around the house problem.
