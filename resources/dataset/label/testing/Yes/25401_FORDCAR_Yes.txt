            I learned to drive on a 1994 Ford Taurus SHO. The car is amazing. It has an enormous trunk, excellent seats, and the handling is superb. I am twenty years old and I love to drive. I have driven many different cars and have ridden in many others. The 93 to 95 SHO's are everything a sports sedan should be: comfortable, extremely roomy, and excellent handling. I love this car because it is everything I need and want in a car. It has enough room for four, a giant backseat for my friends, An enormous trunk, and handling that could best some sports coupes. This car cannot be described as underpowered at all. It accelerates more than briskly going on to the highways, and I have never failed to blow tailgaters away. It is roomy and the sound system is excellent. If you are in the market for a used sedan, but also want a sporty vehicle, test drive an SHO, it will surpass all your expectations. <br><br>
