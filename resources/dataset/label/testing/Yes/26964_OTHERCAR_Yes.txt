            My family owns two Galants right now, a '97 and a 2000.  That sentence alone says a lot...we decided to get the new Galant based on the experience we had with our old one.

<b>What does the Galant look like?</b>  

Exterior: With it's bold lines and sparkling grill, the Mitsu is styled like the upscale and costly German makes.  In fact, the upswept back and logo placement make the '2000 a dead ringer for the BMW 3 Series.  Nobody likes a cheap knock-off, however.  The Galant changed its tires to mag wheels (up from the cheaper hubcap covers) and put a wider tire on this model for better maneuverability.

Interior: The Galant is a family car.  It comes in leather interior, but most models that I have seen have the cloth interior.  It is a tan, gray, or black twill with a nice pattern woven in.  The console is decorated with a fake woodgrain look that is quite appealing.  (This is also borrowed from the BMW, but it works.)  The radio is a 6 CD changer and the car comes with a moon roof, all nice features for the driver and passengers.  These amenities also keep the resale value of the car at a slightly higher amount than other cars in its class.

<b>What does the Galant drive like?</b>  

Performance:  The Galant has some horses under the hood!  The model that my family owns has 150 horses and is a V4.  You can also buy a V6 model, although I have heard about some problems with the V6 engine.  The pickup is quick, the car responds when you need it to.  The car also rides very smooth, which makes it an idea car for people learning to drive or nervous drivers (like my Mom).

Gas Mileage:  The Mitsubishi website bills the gas mileage to be around 30T/40H, although we found that the car averaged right around 25T/40H.  It uses the lower octane levels, so you should be able to save some gas money by using this car.

<b>Where do it buy it?</b>  

You can check my other reviews (priceline's new car service) to see about where to purchase this car.  The manufacturer is pretty aggressive with the financing rates, so the dealer might also be able to work out a deal with you.
