            If you are into a SUV that rides like a big old sedan, gives you the space and comfort of a Lincoln and the sound system of a Blaupunkt, then you need to go to the Jeep dealer near you. I have owned four of these little hummers and must say that I have loved each one. They are sturdy, dependable, good on gas and have great space inside.
The handling of a Jeep is something you can only experience by driving one. They can easily be parked and I have seen them really improve the pick up in the last few years models.
I do love the ride and the way that they drive. I rented an Explorer and did not get a feel of that vehicle as I do when I drive my Jeep. Rent one if you are thinking of buying or leasing one. They are great cars.
I was driving one before the craze came and must say, that I would be hard pressed to go back to driving a sedan type vehicle.
One of the best features of this vehicle is that you cannot lock the doors  with the keys in the ignition.  Now, what is hard about have a small chip monitor the placement of a key in an ignition position?  Also, on my 2000, if the key is not from the manufacturer ( read Kmart made key) the ignition will turnover for eight seconds and then shut down. So, the opportunity for remade keys or keys that get pressed in wax and remade are not able to run these beauties. Smart design.
Jeep does it all and makes driving fun.  I have owned all types and kinds of cars and  jeep is my fav - bar none.
