            Every car I've ever had, have been German sport coupes. With the arrival of a second child and the resultant need for a more practical family car, my wife and I started shopping for an on-the-road SUV (no minivans here!). There's quite a selection available - import and domestic - covering about every price range.

We wanted something mid-priced (no BMW's, Benzes or Range Rovers) and imported (quality and resale). This left us with the usual Japanese suspects - Nissan, Toyota, Honda and their luxury brethren, as well as Mitsubishi, Isuzu and the like.

During our search we narrowed down the field to the Nissan Pathfinder, Acura MDX and Toyota Highlander. In the end, the Highlander was a no-brainer. Why?

-Flawless build quality, solid as a rock
-Great paint (gold)
-A Firm, but comfortable ride 
-Powerful, smooth, quiet engine (V6) along with great handling feel 
-Quiet cabin
-Great seats front and back, although rear seats are too low for good adult thigh support 
-Great seating position and visibility
-Good stereo (JBL), but needs a sub-woofer 
-Good heating and cooling and controls 
-I love having access from front seats to back seats (because of the lack of a console) 
-Easy to fold down rear seats, plenty of storage room, nice storage nooks and crannies in trunk area 

There are some flaws though, but I donï¿½t want to nit pick:

-Engine lags slightly when A/C is on - I didn't expect this with a 220 hp engine
-Generic styling - looks minivanish - needs a bit more muscle
-Leather on seats seems thin - I can't get the baby seat impressions out of it!
-Wind noise is excessive when windows and/or sunroof is open
-Dash styling is inconsistent, the left side of the dash is cool and quirky where the center section is generic.
-Speed, dash lights, etc. illuminate white - A/C and radio lights illuminate green
-Trip computer needs to be refined (my 95 BMW 325 had a great one)
-Driver convenience storage space is limited, no coin or phone holder and door storage compartments are tough to reach into
-The gear shift lever can be wiggled when in the drive position. Due to its location (protruding from under the center of the dash), I accidentally kicked it out of gear once.
-Cruise control controls are confusing when compared to a BMW
-Non-power front passenger seat

But alas, I have never been more satisfied with a vehicle. It's not flawless, but is does satisfy each one of my basic needs. It's powerful, roomy, handles well, is family friendly, was relatively affordable and I loved the Toyota sales and financial team. I wish it was cooler looking, I wish it has a few more luxury features, but it is great for my family, and that is the bottom line. To me, it's like a big German sports wagon - I don't miss my BMW at all!
