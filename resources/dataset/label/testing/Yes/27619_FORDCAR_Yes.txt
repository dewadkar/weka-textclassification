            Ford did something right with this vehicle. It fits a popular niche nowadays - the car-like SUV.  

Although it has some ergonomic quirks, it is still an excellent vehicle and value.  Beware however, that since this is the Escape's first year, recalls and service advisories have been many.  It is for this reason that I would suggest putting this purchase off until next year's model.  If you really need one right now, then, yes, go out and buy it.  You will not regret it.

Positives:
1)  In V6 format, it does not even compare with the Honda CRX, Hyundai Santa Fe, Toyota Rav4, or Kia Sportage.  Lots of raw power and fairly quiet on the inside.
2)  If you don't like the funky look of the Nissan XTerra, you might like the Escape.  Plus, with the V6, the Escape has a 30 horsepower advantage over the Nissan.
3)  Interior dimensions are generous, but without the bulkiness of the new Toyota Highlander.
4)  Good $ value.
5)  Though others have had a problem with the ride, I found it smooth and quiet.  No Jag, but still very good.
6)  Excellent handling in routine situations.  Did not go off road so I cannot comment on that.

Concerns:
1)  Many first year bugs yet to be worked out.
2)  Doors sound hollow and "tinny".
3)  Don't drive the yellow one unless you REALLY like attention...
4)  Smallish gas tank requires frequent gas station stops.
5)  Questionable ergonomics common to all Mazda products with a column shifter (the Escape is the twin of the Mazda Tribute).  The shifter blocks the driver's view of the radio controls.  Further, the LCD display is oftentimes difficult to see with polarized sunglasses.

Overall, a nice package and pretty good execution.  If you can get over the shift lever and the fear of first year bugs, then this IS the compact SUV for you.
