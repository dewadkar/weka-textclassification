            I have been "playing with cameras for the last 6 weeks when I first decided I wanted to take the plunge a go digital. I started out with the Canon S100.

I had been looking at them since they first came out and, since the S110 was launched the price dropped significantly so I decided to go for it. I really liked the size of that little guy.

Unfortunately you tend to sacrifice a lot of functionality when you drop to something that size, so I wet to the S300, better but still not perfect. It was at this point that I decided to ask myself, what exactly did I want in the camera. (Should of done this first). I actually sat down and took a look at what types of photos I had taken in the past, lighting, distance from subjects, etc.

After making a list of what I wanted to use the camera for, the conditions that i used when taking pictures and the frequency that I would be doing each, I went to my local photo shop and started asking questions.

My first mistake initially was buying the camera at a local "electronics superstore", should of went to the photo shop right out. (Live and Learn)

The people at the photo shop were extremly helpful and summed it up in very few words.

The Canon G1 would be the perfect camera for about 90% of the people out there due to the expandibility of the lenses, memory, and the multitude of controls that you can manually set. It has a full automatic setting for those who want to start taking great pictures right away, but will allow you to get more creative when the time comes. As far as the size and weight go, it really is not bigger or heavier than a traditional camera.

I love this camera, it really is a wonderful piece of equipment, and I can't say that I would buy anything different.

I never thought that I would enjoy taking pictures as much as I don now and would like to stress to everyone that even though you may not think you will use all the extras this camera has (THINK AGAIN), you are probably mistaken. Now that you have a digital camera, it doesn't cost you anything to "experiment" with the different settings, and you get to see the results right away, so trust me, you will play!

The only limitations that I can see with this camera is:

1) No underwater case, simple solution! for the .5% of the time I will need to use that I will use my minolta APS camera.

2) no 1600 x 1200 reselution mode. Soulution: with the 192 mb compact flash card I will just use the larger mode, and not worry....

Well enough rambling....If you are looking to get into the digital market and don't want to fork over too much money (not to say that this camera is cheap, because it isn't, but there are cameras that are worth a lot more as well) see what kind of deal you can work out for yourself on one of these and you WILL NOT be disappointed!

I was able to get 30% off the retail price, and get the compact flash card for 50% by buying it at the same time.

P.S. get a big flash card, because you will be taking more pictures than normal! Trust Me.....
