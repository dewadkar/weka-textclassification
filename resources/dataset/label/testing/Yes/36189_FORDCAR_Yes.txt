            My first brand new car. I am so happy, nervous, exited, and scared I hardly notice what the salesman is saying!  After what seems like days (but was really only an hour) I am the proud new owner of a 2000 Ford Focus!

 Am I to believe that this car is really mine?  But it is! The car I fell in love with for it's smooth lines and sharp appearance is the car I bought for it's fuel economy, (24cty/34hgwy miles to the gallon) and it's anti-lock braking system. As soon as this car pulls out of the driveway it's beauty is evident in the envious stares of other drivers.

 This cars features include am/fm stereo cassette, anti-theft devices, remote keyless entry, titanium alloy wheels, an impressive array of comfort features and more. This vehicle offers a twin cam, 130 horsepower 2.0 ltr., Z-TECH 4 cylinder motor (in the ZTS Model) which not only increases horse power, but gives this car a smooth and comfortable ride. 

 I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase of this car and I think anyone in the new car market looking for a sporty, powerful, comfortable and classy car need look no further than the Ford Focus. <br><br>
