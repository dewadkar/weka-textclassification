            Shunning any type of foreign car for the better of my 24 years of driving, I found myself the owner of a 1990 Acura Legend L after my 88 K5 Blazer was stolen. A friend had bought his 89 Legend LS new and I had always enjoyed his car. But I was still hanging onto the notion that no one could care for a car like I could. 

Changing my own oil was a religious experience, as was keeping my vehicles in perfect tune. When I could no longer repair the cars myself, the basic car being as much computer as machinery, I relinquished big and medium repairs to the now accepted �Automotive Technician� and even turned over the drudgery of the revered oil change to a friend who owned and operated a quick oil change business.

I still do the tune-ups and minor maintenance and this kind of stuff is very easy to get to on the Legend.

My 90 Acura Legend was purchased in May of 2000 for $6500 from the estate of a dear friend. He had already performed all of the recommended maintenance procedures, like replacing the plugs, wires, timing belt, brakes and clutch. Records showed the CV joints and axles had been replaced at 80k miles and the odometer now showed 108k miles.

The interior is very comfortable with thick, quality leather seating for 3 to 4. The seat directly behind me, the driver lacks enough legroom to be comfortable on anything less than a short trip to lunch. The presets for the power seat positions have saved several arguments between myself and other drivers that �borrow� the car. Controls are easy to reach, except for radio controls on the radio itself. The L model has a volume and station preset selector at fingertip reach on the brow surrounding the instrument cluster, eliminating a long reach to the radio.

Cupholders! I needz at least one! But you won�t get it with this model. The parts dept can order you an add-on piece that will hold 2, but the holder hides some radio controls and is very shallow. Carbonated bottle escapes over the wall are frequent if you like carving up curvy roads.

Handling is fantastic. I have Michelin sport radials that make the car handle wonderfully. The ride is a pleasant surprise too. It mimics a much larger, heavier vehicle. Highway travel is very comfortable. I prefer it on long trips � my 97 Lexus LX450 stays home. 

I had trouble determining if the engine was running when I first bought it, being used to the GM exhaust note for so long. Very quiet, very smooth. Power is plentiful too, but keeping the rpm up is necessary to really get the Legend to scoot. I did mention my Legend was a 5 speed, didn�t I? Combined mpg is between 32 and 34 on reg unleaded. Premium fuel wakes this vehicle up.

A trunk? It�s been a long time since I had a real trunk. Recently, a fuel pump went bad and I replaced it myself. The access is through the trunk area. It has a very large trunk for its size. I got all 6 foot, 250lbs of myself into the trunk area and had room to work. I didn�t even have to grease up.

Paint is excellent, my car being a black metallic color over a dark gray skirting. The styling still looks good, even being 10 years old. I still get a lot of compliments on the car. I love the moon roof and its functions. Very nice.

Take care when having tires installed, or reinstalled from brake work, rotations, etc. The rotors will warp if the tires are installed with an air wrench that over torques the wheels onto the rotors. The rotors will warp and cause a severe hopping during hard braking. DEMAND that your mechanics install them with a torque wrench, the torque requirements are in your manual.

This would make for a very nice beater, a great dependable car for the daughter at school, or a second car for when the Lexus is in the shop.

Acura was Honda�s racing division and that spirit still exists in their model line. It�s a fine blend of sport and luxury. A soft ride combined with excellent handling skills still impresses those that ride with me when the Sushi bar is about to close.

The LS model has more toys, a mpg calculator, trip functions, temp controls are different, etc. If possible, get the LS model - unless you�re afraid of such things going bad over time.  About the only thing from the LS I�d really like to have is the small trunk lid spoiler. Looks good on ya. 

Enjoy!
