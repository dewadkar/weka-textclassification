            We stopped Santa Fe owners in parking lots and at fast food outlets and checked websites (Epinions, Santa Fe Forum) and did a Google search. Owners LOVE this car. Everyone said it was great in snow, in town, reliable and fun to drive. One man said his wife asked for his so often that he bought another one for himself. We compared all small SUVs at D.C. Auto Show, and at dealers for Escape, RAV4, CR-V, Tribute, Highlander, 4Runner, Forester, Pathfinder (used), Kia Sportage, minivans and Volvo station wagon. Santa Fe had best combination of footroom, comfortable seating, headroom, shoulder room and comfortable front and back seats. I'm 6'2", about 200 lbs, wear size 13 shoes, and have a tricky right knee. I'm very comfortable in S.F. (longest trip so far, 3 1/2 hrs), and so is my wife, 5'2", who had trouble getting into and out of Liberty, but loves the Santa Fe. We got the Santa Fe and everyone in the family (4 drivers) is wild about it. DETAILS: S.F. was designed by California team for American markets, excellent detailing, storage, convenience. Dash has great layout, all controls easy to use. Strong a/c and heater. Big knobs. Stalk and steering wheel layout logical, convenient. Small details thought out, e.g., driver's coffee holder has cutout on side so cup with handle will fit; cupholders in front and back, PLUS oversize cup holders in backseat doors to hold Big Gulp drinks; map lights for driver and passenger; cigarette lighter and two 12V plugs (one front, one back); folding mirrors; CD storage bin plus hidden compartment plus drawer under front passenger seat for cassettes, maps, etc.; carpet and cargo net in back; PLUS under floor tray compartments for first aid kit (supplied), tools, flashlight and flares, etc.; 16" tires; big, comfortable handles on doors; solid thunk when doors close; pop-up rear window so packages, groceries, etc. can be put in without opening up rear; and trim, well organized engine compartment with conveniently placed oil sticks, reservoirs, and air filter snap off cover.  DRIVING: Very nice handling. Compared to Liberty, steering much more responsive, stable. Little toppy on tight cloverleaf like turns, but you adjust to that quickly. Liberty took every bump in the road with a thump coming up through the seat. Backseat was worse. Santa Fe rode like a car, front and back. Easy to park. Turning circle, curb to curb, 37.1' (Consumer Reports says 40'.)  Great visibility. Reasonable acceleration, but would be nice to have a few more hp, say 201 instead of 181. Note that Santa Fe is not a woods and creek bed vehicle. It is a "suburban" suv, and can handle dirt and gravel roads, snow and ice, and with 6" ground clearance should be able to handle moderate terrain, like pasture land. SAFETY: Disk brakes all four wheels. ABS and traction control, some models.  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ranked Santa Fe # 1 among 12 small suv's (S.F. ranked good, RAV4 acceptable, Escape marginal). IIHS test is tougher than govt test. Cars hit offset at 40 mph, as opposed to head-on into wall. Consumer Report test showed Santa Fe braking from 60mph in 137 ft, which is good but not super. OWNER SATISFACTION: Strategic Vision, Inc. polled owners of 13 small suv's for total satisfaction. Santa Fe ranked first with score of 847. RAV4 had 827, Escape 822, CR-V, Cherokee and Grand Vitara were below average. Santa Fe owners particularly praised "Craftsmanship, quietness, ease of use, thoughtfulness and style . . . " DEALERS: We were astounded at how many salesmen of other brands didn't know facts about their cars, including specs. Some Santa Fe Forum comments showed problems with Hyundai dealers, too. Our dealer was first rate (Fairfax Hyundai, Fairfax, Va.) and our salesman was the most knowledgeable and enthusiastic of any salesman we met in 3 months of looking around, bar none (Mark Tudor, call at (703) 352-0444). Highly recommend salesman and dealer. PRICE: We paid about $ 22,550 plus $ 1,150 for after market sunroof and OEM burled wood dash. Compared prices with internet and other local dealer and were satisfied. Also bought OEM cargo liner for back (covers whole area with 2" lip for carrying mulch, pets, firewood, etc., $ 75.). On comparing prices for suv's, be sure the dealers for other cars give you their car price including all the features that come standard with the Santa Fe. Some try to compare base price of their car with loaded standard features of Santa Fe. CONCLUSION: Among many good reviews, a Road & Track editor said that he would buy Santa Fe ahead of CR-V and RAV4. We agree. We think it is a terrific car and a very good value. Take a drive, and you'll see its appeal. Good luck.
