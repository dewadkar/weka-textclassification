            What I wanted was something that would seat 8 people. Maybe a nice SUV or something? Not too big, not too little? 

What I got was a huge behemoth that seats 12 -- and is the extended 3/4 ton size. When my Dh (darn husband) called me from the dealership to TELL (mind you he told, he did not ask) me he was buying it, I just about came unglued. Not a pretty site. Additionally, I wanted a bright blue or cheery red van -- something easy to find in the parking lot? Noooo.... he had to get what he described as 'Autumn' and I thought in my mind 'Baby Poop brown.' I just about sat down right then and there and cried. I was going to be stuck driving one of those ugly baby poop colored vans for the rest of my life.

Okay, fast forward three hours to my Dh (still means darn husband) driving up in the van. 

The van is a beautiful golden brown. However it looks like what it is -- a HUGE 12 passenger extended van. It was too big for me to get into the driveway, I just can't to it. (Dh can, I can't, however HE is a truck driver)

Well, I have driven this van for almost a year now. 

I do not know what I would do without it. 

Comfort, reliability, and room for a herd of kids, this van rules the road. After an initial adjustment period of about a week, where I had to get used to driving and parking the beast, I finally decided I could not live without it. I think the turning point was actually 16 yardsales, and several cribs and beds, toys and clothing bags, books and boxes later...

Our family takes in fosterchildren, and I have three children ages 2, 2, and 3, we often have more children in car seats than the average car will hold. The fact that the van seats everyone comfortably is a terrific feature for me. 

The van has been reliable, and other than a nail in the tire, and oil changes, we have not had to do anything with the van. One of the negatives are the squeaks and rattles on bumpier roads. Although to be honest, sometimes the noises are coming from cargo that has shifted. (Like kids books, toys, Happy meal containers, etc.) 

Some of the features I like include the back deck heat and air with separate controls, and the fact that the seats remove for added cargo space. 

Now I rarely let my Dh (dear husband) drive. I love it too much to relinquish the controls....

If you have a large family, an organization or business that needs transportation this might be the van for you.<br><br>
