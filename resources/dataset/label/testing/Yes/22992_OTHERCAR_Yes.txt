            The Polaroid PDC 640 Digital Camera is the first Digital Camera my Dad picked up for my family to use on vactions and outings.  This light D-camera packs a punch for it's inexpensive $175 and under!  

   This mid-level digital camera features a 1.8 LCD display screen for clear, crisp images while viewing your pictures, multiple flash modes; normal flash, no flash, auto flash, and more, for different types of days.  
    
    Removable memory for taking more photo's without uploading to your hard-drive when on those long vacations. A self-timer for those family photo's you don't want to miss out on.
 

                     More Details... 

     This D-camera is made by Polaroid so you know it's top of the line quality for it's price and built durabily!
     
This camera is a "Point and Shoot" camera for those "Kodak" moments.  

The Disk Media used for this camera is 3.3v SmartMedia. 

The Port Capability is Serial, so you can plug and download to your computer.

The Storage Capacity is (MB) 2 MB but there's four setting's:
* one star = -150+ photo's but it's the smallest picture

** two stars = -75+ photo's a great setting for picture's for your website!

*** three stars = -60+ photo's about average, ok for website but good quality for an average size photo.

**** four stars = -30+ to fill your whole website, good for backgrounds.

All in all,
    This is a great lightweight digital camera!  The only 2 cons about this camera are the photos are grainy if you plan to print them out.  You can play with the brightness and sharpness to get it clear, but it's pretty difficult.  The second con is that there is no zoom, so you have to stand farther or closer depending on your positioning.

   This is a great digital camera for the whole family.  I recommend this camera to anyone that has a website or would like to capture their vacations, quick and easy!

    Thanks,
