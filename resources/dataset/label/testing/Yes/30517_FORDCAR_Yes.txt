            I wanted a crew cab back in 1993 when I was looking for something new. With gas mileage a consideration I learned the 351 V8 was the smallest engine offered. With such lousy gas mileage from the V8 I ended up in an Isuzu Trooper. Well, I learned later about diesels from people I talked to and got it in my head that I would get one when I could. I bought a used 1999 Ford Lariat Crew Cab 4X4 diesel with the short bed and 41,000 miles. It has the trailer tow package, camper package, CD/Cassette/AM/FM, leather seats, automatic transmission, AC, power windows, doors, mirrors, etc. Everything except auto locking hubs. I hate the tow mirrors. They ARE great for towing, but around town you have to be careful of smacking the &quot;Dumbo ears&quot; into other truck mirrors in traffic or anything else that is close. I wish they could be pushed in for non-towing travel. That said, the truck is the best one-ton (or 3/4 ton) I've ever been in or driven. It rides like a 1/2 ton and totes 1 ton easily. I've had 30 sheets of sheetrock in the back with no sway at all. Driving is tall and there is a great view of the road and it cruises well on the highway. While not a fast cornering vehicle, it holds it's own. The 4 wheel antilock brakes are fantastic. I had a Jeep Cherokee suddenly take a turn in front of me. I was able to steer and break without plowing into it. I was scared, but the brakes delivered. I also had a young driver do a surprise U-turn from the right lane about a car length ahead right across my bow. Again, the brakes worked flawlessly. The engine is noisy, but that's a diesel for you. The upside is torque and great gas mileage for a vehicle this size. Around 20 on the highway and 16 in mixed traffic. The downside is higher maintenance cost for the diesel. Can you say, &quot;14 quarts of oil&quot;? All in all it probably evens out in the long run. It is not a fun vehicle to park or drive in tight places. If you are looking for a vehicle that will tow 10,000 pounds, haul over a ton, still have room for 5 or 6 people in complete comfort, get good gas mileage, and have people come up to you at the local lumber yard to ask you, &quot;How do you like it?, Nice truck, etc.&quot; then this truck is for you. If you don't like to climb in, have trouble parking, rarely need gargantuan towing and hauling capabilities, and want to be a little more inconspicuous, you might wait for the Toyota Crew Cab that will be out in the fall.<br><br>
