            i bought this camera (then the D-340L) back when it first came out over a year ago.  it is the only digital camera of that day that is still for sale at all major stores.  that's how good this camera is.  although it is considerable less today than what i paid for it a long time ago, it is, as i said the last of its generation of digicams.  but at three hundred bucks, this is the biggest deal you can get for a digital camera.  it has over a megapixel resolution, many flash modes, an olympus lense, and great reliability, and many other features common on both film cameras (photo modes) and digital cameras (picture previews on the lcd screen).  

i like this camera because it is made sturdily and with much quality like all olympus products, and i especially like how they make the on button be sliding the protective lense door to the side.  the only snags i could find on the camera were that it does not have an optical zoom (only 2x digital), and that its battery life, like most digital cameras, was not very good when using the lcd too much.  also, as is the case with many digital cameras even today, the camera took a short pause after taking a picture to write it to the memory card.  

these problems however are easily looked over.  just use lithium aa's and use the screen sparingly -  only to look at photos, not to take them.  and the problem with waiting for the picture to write is hardly worth getting upset over.  one more thing that i like about the camera was that the focusing is very easy.  just press down the shutter half way to focus the lense on the object in the center of the viewfinder and then reconfigure your picture how you want it.  

the lense will still stay focused on what you had in the middle of the viewfinder.  this is very easy to do and also, it is much bettter than having a fixed-focus lense which gives poor quality pictures.  speaking of which, the quality of the pics i got back from this camera are superb.  it is still good though, to adjust brightness and contrast in adobe photodeluxe afterwards on your computer if you want to print it out, email, or whatever (the adobe software comes with the camera).<br><br>
