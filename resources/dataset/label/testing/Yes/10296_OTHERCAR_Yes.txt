            My husband bought this camera for me this past Christmas.  To be honest, it isn't that bad to be so inexpensive.  It does hold 70 pictures, takes great pictures outside, but indoors it can be a little moody.  It has the condition settings on it.  You push the power button and push the mode button until you get to the desired setting.  the icons are:  a person standing under a cloud, a person standing in the sun, a person standing in a house with light, and a person standing in a dark house.  It also has the flash icon.  When you pick your desired setting, you hold the select button.  If you want to add the flash, you have to go through all of the settings again until you get to the flash icon, and select it.

You ca delete the last picture you took or all of your pictures.  It takes 2 AA batteries, and hooks up to the USB port on your computer.  It has software with it that installs the camera driver and the picture software that I think works really well.  The software has many different doctoring features on it, as well as special effects.  Not only can you make the picture brighter, or darker, which seems to be a function I use a lot, but you can add words to your pictures, smudge them, and other such fun things.
the editing features are something I use a lot.  Sometimes, I can get a bad picture and by brightening it up, I can get a perfect picture.

Another feature is the webcam feature.  It pretty much behaves like your typical webcam and has a little stand that comes with it. I use it mostly as a camera though because I take pictures of everything, so it pretty much goes everywhere with me.  Therefore, I do recommend this camera, it has served me well.  Just don't expect extremely high quality pictures from it.  I really don't have to use my flash that much unless it is really dark.  One of my pet peeves about it, is that I sometimes have to take the same picture multiple times at different settings because I may not be sure about the conditions.  It works though and it is cheap.
