            I've had this car for about a year now and I think it's great. The ride is very smooth on the freeway up to about 85 mph. The performance is quite good, although it by no means compares to any of the real sports cars.

I like it that Audi didn't seem to go cheap on any of the systems. Where others give you little tiny space saving spare tires, this car has a full sized one. The spare tire even comes on it's own mag wheel too! I would have expected the spare tire to be some on some crappy steel wheel.

Other little things that come with the car are the first aid kit, little tool kit in the back, emergency reflector triangle, roadside assistance, and free scheduled maintenance. I was able to buy this car and not think about anything else.

A couple little maintenance problems I've had however. About a month after I got the car, it intermittently would not start. This was traced to a "Faulty Relay" according to the dealer and they replaced it under warranty. A little inconvenient however since it took 4 days to get the part in. Another problem I've been having is that the windshield washer spray appears to not be working. It looks like it's been clogged a bit. Also, I've had a little trouble with the transmission. When I shift from 1st gear to 2nd (stick shift), it sometimes doesn't shift very smoothly, especially when the engine is cold.

One ongoing problem I've had is with wind noise. When I drive past 75mph or so, I sometimes hear a wind noise coming in the rear window. I hear that this is fairly common in the A4 and that it is caused by the aerodynamics of the side mirrors.

Other than these minor problems, I think the car is great!
