            THIS OPINION IS ON THE NEW 2001 ACURA MDX NOT THE SLX

A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to test drive the new Acura MDX and I must say that was quite impressed. I have owned the Jeep and the explorer for about two years each, but was not quite satisfied with what I got. When Honda released there sport utility I found some of the character I was not able to find in the Explorer and the Cherokee. 
But when I heard that Acura was coming out with its first Sport Utility to be sold in Canada, I was quite excited. So I finally had the chance to take the MDX for a test spin. 
All I can say after taking that test spin is wow. I never thought that the new MDX would be so great. I must admit that it is a bit on the expensive side, but after you drive this beauty you will see what separates this from all other domestic Sport Utilities. If you thought that Honda had a problem keeping up with demand for the new Honda Odyssey, I will warn you, once people become aware of the MDX Honda will find themselves with a severe shortage of MDX's. I know that they will have to radically increase production.

In my opinion the immediate competition for this beauty, are Lexus, Ford, General Motors, Toyota, Chrysler, Land Rover and yes even Mercedes. In terms of features, design, and safety the MDX blows the competition to the Moon! 

From a look at the exterior you might question the space and power of this beauty, but that will all change once you take spin in this dream machine. After you compare you will see that this GEM is a steal. 

I can see people leaving Lexus, Land Rover and even Mercedes to come to the MDX. It has all the options and for a fraction of the price.

WATCH OUT ALL OTHER SPORT UTILITY MANUFACTURERS HONDA/ACURA HAS A GEM IN THERE HANDS AND IT IS WAITING TO BE UNLEASHED, RUN IF YOU CAN BECAUSE THE ACURA MDX IS HERE TO STAY FOR A LONG LONG LONG TIME.<br><br>
