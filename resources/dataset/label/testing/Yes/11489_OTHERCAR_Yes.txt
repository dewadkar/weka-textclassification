            Average Family Van, Pros Outweigh Cons, but think Safety 1st. Overall, nice van for the family and if you have small children like I do, ages 4 and 6, it's easy access for them. Love the cargo room for groceries and bigger items. The removable 3 row seats are a plus for trips or transporting bigger items when not needed. Air pump/compressor is nice for blowing up tires, pool toys, etc. Not a van to brag about, but nice none the less. So far the Van has been an excellent choice and value. I was originally going to buy a sport ute (GMC Envoy XL) but with a family it was not practical. If you are going to buy this vehicle make sure to get the towing prep package. It will increase towing capacity by 1500 lbs and is very inexpensive, so even if you don't tow it will still benefit you in resale as well as better cooling for oil and transmission fluids. Hitch does not come with this package (sold seperately). Also, you should opt for the security package. Along with content theft alarm it gives you drivers side automatic sliding rear door and ultrasonic rear parking assist. I also upgraded the am/fm stereo cd player with an am/fm stereo cd and cassette player. Those are the only factory options you can get on this vehicle. Total for all three options was under $1000.00. If you have kids there are also optional litter bins that fit in part of the rear door pockets, they are removable and a nice place to keep trash.
