            Toyota Avalon LX, 2003

Affordable Luxury

In its third year following a major face-lift in 2000, the Avalon, which is Toyota&#146s flagship automobile, will remain unchanged for 2003.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Avalon is a near luxury automobile that comes loaded with a long list of standard comfort equipment and it is also fully loaded with quality safety features for the protection of all occupants on board.

The Toyota Avalon is a well-designed sedan that has some power under the hood. It comes with a 3-liters DOHC V-6 that will not only give you power but also a smooth drive.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

The Toyota Avalon I test-drove came with leather seats, on the LX trim model leather seats are optional. The quality of the leather was superior and the workmanship was flawless.

Once behind the steering wheel, the driver will have an excellent unobstructed all around vision. I did like the oversize side view mirrors; they offer the driver an excellent view of oncoming traffic and a minimal dead spot.

From the driver&#146s seat you will have an excellent view of all the gauges and aside for the sound system which I found a little confusing all the control buttons are within easy reach. 

Although the LX trim is not as fully loaded with standard equipment as the XL and XLS, it still has a long list of standard features: air conditioning, power windows, power locks power side view mirrors, tilt steering, cruise control, AM/FM radio cassette, CD player, rear window defrost and alloy wheel.

The quality of the sound coming from the sound system was a little disappointing; not that it was very bad it is simply that I would have expected a richer sound in such a beautiful automobile.

For both the front and the rear you will have ample legroom, one thing I noticed is that the rear seat passengers have more headroom that the front seat has.

The exterior:

The Avalon is a beautiful four door sedan, all the panels fit tightly and the design is excellent.

The paint job is of a superior quality and the choice of alloy wheel is excellent for this type of automobile.

The trunk will give you 15.9 cubic feet of volume for your equipment or groceries to be transported in.

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

The Toyota Avalon LX, 2003 is a definite pleasure to drive on both the highway and within city limits. If your budget does not permit the cost of a luxury automobile but you still like to drive in comfort, test drive an Avalon.
