            With 4 months and 6k miles on my new company car, a 2000 Intrepid ES I selected, feel ready to review it:  Overall it is a roomy(nice big trunk) and good handling car. As the reviews say, the 3.2 l engine doesn't sound like the finest of machinery(loud/rough)but it gets the job done.Mileage is extraordinary- 23mpg around town and 28+ on highway.

 The car handles well and is a good, comfortable distance cruiser. The in-dash 4 cd player premium sound package is awesome, and the little bells and whistles like the information system and the autostick are still fun to play with. The tan leather interior on the 24M package looks upscale and the seats are firm and comfy.
 Downsides: The blindspots are pretty big but hopefully you get used to them before you meet the body shop guy...and the opening to the trunk is pretty small(D-C can't you improve the trunk access?)
 I looked hard at Intrigue/Impala and Taurus and feel the Intrepid offers more features per dollar and certainly more room. One nice plus is Intrepid tows 2000lbs-double the GM's and more than Fords too. This so far feels like the first company car I'll buy when it hits the fleet retirement age.<br><br>
