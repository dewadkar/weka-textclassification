             When I saw the price tag on our new Chevy Tahoe for the first time, I like to have passed out. I was not sure it would be worth the money. I am now completely and positively sure it is.
 I bought the Tahoe LT model. It came with leather interior, premium sound system, tow package and all the extras. The towing capacity of the Tahoe is close to that of the half ton pickup and does well towing a 16' boat. I have been told that the sound system was designed by Bose. After you hearing how the sound system sounds, it is easy to believe that Bose had a hand in designing it. It has a crisp sound, that completely surrounds you. And what is there to say about leather, accept leather.
  The Tahoe does have a couple of problems. The gas mileage is not that great, around 14mpg on average. But the most bothersome thing about the Tahoe comes to light when you are driving through high winds. Due to the Tahoe's high profile, high winds cause it to drift in the wind direction.
You get used to the drifting of the vehicle and after a while it really isnï¿½t a problem.
  All said and done, I would recommend the 2001 Chevy Tahoe to anyone
