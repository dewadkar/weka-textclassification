            This compact SUV is anything but.  It's interior is roomy in both the front and the back seats.  The only place that categorizes this SUV as a "mini" is in the cargo area - which is smaller than your standard SUV, but still quite roomy.  My first impression of this racy little number was "Wow".  But how did it handle?  And how would it work (physically and financially) into my busy, jam packed life?

Perfectly.  It's affordability was what amazed me.  You can own a brand new Ford Escape for thousands less than it's bigger brothers and sisters.  But you still get a quality SUV without skimping on style or dependability.  The V6 model (very highly recommended) well equipped goes for around $19,200.  The gas mileage on this vehicle is great compared to other SUV's.  The 16 gallon fuel tank gets me an average of 22 highway miles per gallon.   

Both the exterior and interior are sturdy, yet stylish.  The interior has loads of those little extras that car owners love.  The cargo area is big enough for two Labrador Retrievers (to put things in prospective) or a month's worth of groceries.  The seats are firm and comfortable and come in cloth, leather, or a nifty cloth/leather combo.  Leg room is ample (in both the front and back seats), as it head room.  The driver is treated to a high and mighty ride.
The only thing I did not like was the position of the gear shift.  It is akwardly poised in front of the radio/CD player.  A small flaw that I don't even notice anymore.

The Escape handles extremely well.  My first concern in owning an SUV was how this vehicle would drive compared to other sedans I have owned.  Not only was I pleasantly surprised, I was thoroughly impressed.  The Escape turns very well, and is fun to drive.  Quick corrections are handled with ease.  Whether fighting stop and go morning rush hour, or taking her out on the open highway for a weekend trip, my experiences in my Escape have always been pleasurable.  

All in all, this a very well rounded vehicle.  Although I would not categorize it as a an "off road" vehicle, it is rugged enough to deal with my everyday life yet stylish enough to go anywhere my weekend takes me.
