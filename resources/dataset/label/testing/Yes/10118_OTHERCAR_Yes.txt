            I purchased my 1994 Protege, while I was pregnant. I need a car with four doors that would make it easy to get a car seat in and out. So a friend of a friend found me mine. I wasn't crazy about it from the beginning because of the dark gray color, I had just gotten rid of a beloved red truck...But other than that it suited me fine, until....The noises started. My car shakes, and rattles. The automatic seatbelts only go down part of the time. When at a standstill the whole car starts to rattle, but this goes away if you shift into neutral, in an automatic. Other then that it has been a trusty car and has gotten me to where I need to go. If I were to purchase a new vehicle I would consider this car again, as long as it was bought new and not used.<br><br>
