            <b> The Canon Powershot G1 is an exceptional advancement to technology.  I have had many other cameras in my time, but this product really proved itself.  Besides this camera being expensive, it is an amazing camera.  

Have you ever tried to take precious memory pictures at a special event such as a child's birth, graduations, promotions and more?  For these events you might have to higher a professional photographer.  NOT ANYMORE!!! With this camera you can take the sharpest clearest pictures that you could have only dreamed of having!  

The Canon Powershot G1 was a gift from my parents.  They had seen my pictures of when my child was born.  The pictures were not too clear and some people even had red eyes.  My parents went out and bought me this wonderful camera.  I am very pleased with this camera and I do not believe I will need to purchase another camera for a long time!  Not to mention spending money every time I need a disposable camera.  Those can get very aggravating.  

This camera has exceptionally clear pictures.  It has versatile lens attachments and a built in flash system.  Not to mention a built in 3x zoom button and movie recording and playback options.  

After reading just parts of the directions I knew everything about this camera.  I was able to set it up easily and take pictures right away!  

I highly suggest purchasing this camera.  It will save you a lot of money.  The only thing you have to worry is keeping the lens clean.  If you take good care of this camera you will be fine. You can have a case which you have attached to you so the camera does not fall.  

You will not be disappointed with this camera.
