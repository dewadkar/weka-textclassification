            I got this when it first came out so I paid $800 for it.  I am quite happy with it, even at that price.  The pictures it takes are wonderful, and can be blown up to  8.5x11 without difficulty.  You can take pics at 3 different resolutions.  There are many features, most of which I've never had occassion to use.  It is a bit awkward to hold and looks a bit strange, but the quality of the pics more than make up for that.

The negatives are all fixable, except one:
Uploads to computers take FOREVER, you'll have to get a card reader.

They don't include rechargable batteries.  You can just buy your own or get one of the large batteries that other companies sell.

There is no strap for the lens cap.  I tied mine to the handstrap with some dental floss.  Otherwise you'll loose it.  It doesn't look all that nice though.  I'm not sure why they did this.

The annoying, non-fixable thing is that when the camera turns off you lose most of your settings.  So if you had set the flash to off, when it shuts off, it resets, so when you turn it back on the flash is on. This can be very very annoying when you are taking pictures at a place where flash isn't allowed and the time between the pics you are taking is long enough that the camera turns itself off.  Similarly, the LCD resets itself to on everytime you turn it off.  This runs the battery down quickly.  So when you turn it on, you have to change it back to no flash and turn the LCD off again.  THe only solution, if you can call it that, that I found was to every minute or so, put the zoom in or out a little bit, thus preventing it from turning off and resetting everything.  

Despite these inconveniences, I'd still highly recommend this camera.
