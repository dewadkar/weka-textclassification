            After driving an old clunker throughout and after college, I finally broke down and bought a new vehicle.  I looked at many different 2000 model cars such as the Celica, Maxima, Accord Coupe SE, Mustang, and others.  But I fell in love with the 2000 Eclipse almost instantly.  I've heard some complaints about the new styling, but you won't hear any from me.  I think the new Eclipse is far more elegant looking than its predecessors.  My GT draws plenty of looks when I pass by; many people have approached me to find out what it is.  The reaction always seems to be the same: &quot;Awesome!&quot;  To me it looks like a cross of the 3000GT and an early model Dodge Intrepid, with a bit of a Ferrari look too.

Inside, the Eclipse is roomier than you'd guess from the outside.  The back seat will be cramped for anyone over 5'10&quot;, but for average height adults it should be no problem.  The dash has been pushed away from the front seat, so there is a less claustrophobic feel than in most sport coupes.  Controls are in intuitive locations.  The truck is roomy enough for most uses, and the back seats fold forward for even more room.
I really like having the radio/CD display up high on the dash so as not to draw your eyes too far from the road.  The seats are very comfortable, and the 7 speaker Infinity CD stereo pumps out some great sounds.  

The 2000 Eclipse GT really shines in its performance.  This thing will move!!!  The automatic V-6 will hum along nicely at 120 mph with little engine noise.  It was a smooth ride, but I was afraid to take it to the 150 mph listed on the speedometer (one day!).  Fuel economy is pretty good.  I get around 30 miles per gallon on the freeway.  The car's suspension does a great job of filtering road vibration and bumps.  The &quot;sportstronic&quot; transmission is more of a novelty than anything, but it's fun to play around with sometimes.  It pretty easy to speed in this thing.  Even though its low to the ground, you really don't realize just how fast you are going if you don't keep your eyes on the speedometer.  

About the only negative thing I can say about the new Eclipse is that the spoiler obstructs my view out of the back window a little.  The car just doesn't look &quot;complete&quot; without the spoiler, so I put up with it.  I opted for the sun and sound package.  The only things I didn't get were leather seats, electric seats, and rear wiper.  I might have gotten those, but there wasn't one on the lot in white, and I wanted the car THAT DAY!  

The 2000 Eclipse GT is a fine car indeed.  I think it'll appeal to the 20 and 30-something crowd.  Don't plan on taking long road trips with people in the back seats, but other than that I can't recommend it more!
