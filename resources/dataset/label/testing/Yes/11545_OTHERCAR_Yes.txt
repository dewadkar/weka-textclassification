            Boy, there sure is a lot of SUV's (sport utility vehicles) on the road today.  It seems like everybody wants a peice of the pie.  That is probably the reason why the SUV market is being completely watered down with laughable SUV's from the likes of Ford, Infinity, Mercedes, Lexus, Nissan, etc, etc, etc.  I apologize if you drive an SUV from one of these manufacturers but I didn't mean to single you out.  There is plenty of absolute trash on the roads today...and it wasn't me that made you buy it.  I've driven about 90% of all the SUV's available today, and I have to say it saddens me in such a time of respect and pride in automaking, SUV's still dominate the market by flooding it with below average pap made especially for soccar moms that don't like to drive in the rain.  Yawn.

Enter Jeep!  They've been making four wheel drive vehicles since World War II.  As a matter of fact, it is said by many people that Jeep played a big part in helping us win the war.  I'm one of those people that sincerely beleive that.  In a time where American automobile industries have a bad reputation (which confuses me because it's carried over from the miserable mid 1980's...and here it is 2000.  That's another story.) Jeep shines above the rest.  As a matter of fact, the Jeep Cherokee is one of the biggest exported vehicles America has to offer!  There's a reason...

People want to be the best!  People want to be #1!  This is only natural.  If it wasn't, you would probably see Kia's and Isuzu's dominate the roads.  People from all over the world beleive that the Japanese car industry is unkillable.  Bulletproof.  Immortal.  Untouchable.  They've rightfully built a name for themselves, and people took notice.  When you think quality cars, now you think along the lines of Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen (I know...they're a German car company which manufactures in Mexico...but the idea of quality is there), etc , etc, etc.  Don't you think it would take a superior vehicle to dominate the overseas market?  I do.  That's not the reason why I like the complete line of Jeep (especially Cherokee) products.  Here are the reasons...

1)  The best 4x4 available of the market.  The most bang for your buck!  Actually, I lie when I say they offer THE BEST.  I give the best 4x4 to the Hummer.  The Hummer is the only true 4x4 left in the world, but I don't have $80,000 to shell out for a Hummer.  I wish I did, but I don't.  Anyway, the Cherokee is made so you just put it on the ground and it's ready to go off-roading.  I didn't buy a brand new Cherokee simply for the purpose of off-roading, though.  The way I look at it, my wife and son will also be in the Jeep with me at times.  If it can handle extreme off-road situations that leave other SUV's spinning their tires, just imagine how this does in the snow!  Honestly, this thing is increadible.  The only 4x4 systems even close to this in my opinion are those made by General Motors.  You will never understand what I'm talking about until you take a Cherokee (Jeep XJ) out in the snow.  Absolutely INCREADIBLE!  I bought mine with the optional SelectTrac 4x4 system, and it works miracles.  Standard is the shift on the fly CommandTrac, which includes RWD, 4x4, Neutral, and 4x4Low.  SelectTrac includes all of these plus a 4x4 system that will monitor the amount of slippage on each tire and distribute torque better.  This make for a nice feature come winter.

2)  Quality.  I'm not going to buy something that has a reputation for breaking down.  No way!  Not for the kind of money vehicles go for today.  Jeep quality is top-notch.  I used to sell cars (is that hissing I hear?), and Jeeps would come in from all kinds of years to all kinds of conditions.  Come winter, even in the coldest weather (I live way up in New Hampshire.  Things tend to get pretty darn COLD!) all of the Jeeps would ALWAYS start.  Not just some most of the time, or all of them some of the time, but all of them would start all of the time.  I would see Jeep's come in with 250,000+ miles and start every time.  Very minimal maintanence goes into a Jeep, which I concider a big plus.  Warrenty or not, I'm not paying this much hard-earned cash to have my vehicle in the shop all the time!

There are problems with the Jeep Cherokee as far a quality goes.  You will find quality problems in ANY vehicle you drive be it your brand new Hyundai or your brand new BMW.  They ALL have some problems here and there.  When a vehicle is released that is perfect, I'll be in line to buy one.  The good thing is, compared to a lot of other vehicles, Jeep doesn't have nearly as many problems.  The only problem I have had so far is with the directional lever on the left side of the steering column.  It doesn't automatically turn off any more.  I have to manually turn it off or be forever driving with my directionals on (depending on your age, this could be a benefit).  This is the only Cherokee I have heard that this has happened to, so it was probably just me beating on the thing.  Other problems that haven't happened to me but are also abundant is:  the power steering belt tends to go pre-maturely, and the tires.  Unfortunately, the stock tires that come on your Cherokee brand new are garbage.  Some people complain that the tires make excessive noise and tend to make the Jeep shake at about 55mph.  I didn't happen in mine although the tires are the same.  I don't know what it could be, but it can be corrected with a change of tires.  The dealership you bought it at, depending on it's reputation, will change them free of charge under standard warrenty.

Another thing that I love about my Cherokee is the &quot;uni-frame&quot; construction.  If you're into off-roading, this could be a bad thing due to the fact that if you lift it, you need to change the suspension.  For everybody else, it's a breath of fresh air.  Most SUV's are a body-on-frame construction, which is why they squeak and rattle and make all kinds of nasty noises.  You won't find that in a Jeep Cherokee no matter the age.

3)  Style.  I'm not going to drive a vehicle that looks absolutely rediculous.  Just like I'm not going to wear a shirt that clashes with my pants which clashes with my socks which clashes ith my shoes.  The Jeep Cherokee remains fad-free.  I LOVE IT!!!  They haven't changed the style since 1985.  They last remodel was a change of interior in either 1996 or 1997, which looks great.  Trends come and go, but the style of the Cherokee is no trend.  It tends to say a lot about your personality.  How many trendy fools have you seen driving those silly XTerra's or Vehi-Crosses?  I'd say it's close to 100% for me.  The styles on those is simply laughable, but remember, it's a free country and how have the right to look silly if you want to.

4)  Speed.  I upgraded from an Isuzu Rodeo (blah...what was I drinking?), and I'm so happy I have a vehicle with some speed again.  I haven't had a vehicle that made me this happy about performance since my old Dodge Dakota Sport (all I can say about the Dakota with RWD and the 360 engine is WOW!).  Getting on the highway isn't a problem anymore with the Cherokee 4.0 Liter Inline-6.  An absoluetly increadible engine.  It pumps out about 190 horsepower which makes spinning the tires an embarassing mistake instead of a full-fledged effort.  Jeep has been making this I6 engine for some time, and it is tried and true, which loops back to the whole quality issue.  I think the only engine I would feel more comfortable in would be a Cummins Deisel.

5)  Utility.  For the size of this vehicle, it packs some amazing utility!  Granted, it's a little bit tricky to get my son into the compact backseat, but when it comes down to helping a friend move or carrying cargo from the hardware store to your house, the Cherokee really shines.  The backseat can fold down which opens a whole new world of utility.  The only con to this would be it's not a rear 60/40 folding seat...which means if you need to put the seat down, nobody will be riding in the back.  The roof rack is increadible easy to reach, and when it comes down to putting a Christmas Tree or some wood on top, I am very much impressed.  I miss my truck mainly for the utility aspect, but this handy little SUV aims to please.  Granted, if utility is a big concern with you, I suggest a bigger SUV, or even better, an extended cab truck (I recommend the Chevy Silverado).  If you do casual work around the house and moving around, the Cherokee is all that and a bag of chips.  Getting into a bigger SUV also tends to sacrifice other things like Driveability, Performance, Style, or some other things.  If I needed something bigger, I would probably just buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee or a truck.

6)  Fun to Drive!  I used to hear commercials saying that a vehicle was fun to drive.  Yeah, okay, maybe on a long stretch of road or through some curves...but what about forcing your way through a busy highway or sitting in traffic?  I hate that stuff.  I'm not going to tell you I now love it with my Cherokee, but I can honestly say I have no problems getting in to drive to the store or something else of that nature.  When I look back on all the past vehicles I've ever had, driving can be a real pain.  Now, I LOVE TO DRIVE MY JEEP!  When I get done writing this, I'm probably going out for a Sunday spin.

7)  Safety.  I wouldn't buy a vehicle that is unsafe for my family just like I wouldn't dress my son in oily rags on a hot day.  The Cherokee shines through.  As a matter of fact, just the other day, a friend of mine and her 4 kids were in a terrible accident.  A truck pulled out in front of their Cherokee and they collided, which caused them to spin into the other lane of on-coming traffic.  They hit another car head on, which threw them off the road and they hit a telephone pole.  Beleive this or not it's the truth...not ONE of them was hurt!  This is amazing to me and I couldn't feel safer with my family than with a Cherokee.  Just for giggles, if you're thinking about buying a Cherokee, ask some people that have one and have been in an accident what they think about they safety features on their Jeep.  I'm willing to bet you don't get one negative response.  All I can say is AMAZING.

8)  Drivability.  This is where a lot of people tend to go sour on the Jeep Cherokee.  It doesn't drive like a car.  God forbid!  A truck-like vehicle doesn't drive like a car!  Tell the press!  I love the ride.  I think it's fantastic.  I've never been much into cars, anyway.  If you're looking for a nice riding vehicle, buy a car, this isn't your cup 'o tea.  If you insist on an SUV anyways...well...you've been warned.  The angle of approach and angle of departure is amazing in this vehicle.  Unless you're off-roading without a spotter, don't even worry about bottoming this thing out.  There is a bit of body roll with the Jeep, too.  This is just something you'll have to expect.  Don't confuse body roll with a Jeep tipping over, though.  If you've seen half the stuff I've done with my Cherokee, you would know what I'm talking about.  Also, when it comes to night driving, I recommend you shell out the extra cash and get the optional fog lamps.  They increase your night driving visability like you wouldn't beleive!  Oh, and for those of you into towing, the Jeep Cherokee is one of the few vehicle you can FLAT TOW with no damage.  The transfer case was made with that in mind!

All in all, the Jeep Cherokee will give you the most bang for your buck!  Hands down!  I'm one to do extensive homework before I jump into a big financial decision, and the Cherokee won my unconditional love by a landslide.  I would never picture myself driving an SUV 5 years ago, but here I am...but wait...I don't drive a SUV!  I drive a Jeep!



P.S. - I apologize for a few spelling errors in here, but I'm running short on time and just don't have the time to correct it.  I wrote a bit too much, but only because I love my Cherokee to death!  I never won a spelling-bee, so please don't throw any broken bottles or rocks at me.<br><br>
