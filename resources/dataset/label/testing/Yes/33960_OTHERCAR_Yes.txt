My mom has a 1995 Lincoln Continental. When my parents first purchased this vehicle my mom thought it was too large of a vehicle for her. Then she got behind the wheel. Once she drove that car she basically fell in love with it. I think that the car is not meant for younger people such as myself. The car rides like nothing I've ever seen. This Continental has plenty of power underneath the hood and a nice interior styling to finish off the car. My mom thinks her car is the greatest thing in the world and told me herself that she would never think of buying anything else other then a Lincoln.
