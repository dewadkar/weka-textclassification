             At first I was a little concerned about buying my 1992 Cutlass because of the year of the car. But I was quite mistaken, these cars are very  reliable  well into their golden years.I bought it to get me to work, in and out of the city and for events on the weekends.

 This just is a quick & basic review of the car since my field is computers and not mechanics :). My car is equipped with power everything ( windows,seats ect.), automatic trans., AC, Overdrive on the 3.8 v6, cruise, tilt, & basically everything else that you can get on that model.
 
 When it comes to gas (while no one likes the prices) my Cutlass gets decent mileage except it gets a little thirsty with the AC cranked around town. As for tune ups- it seems to run fine with the dealer maintained check ups. The interior is very nice and soft compared to newer cars with the harder seats (example Toyota's).The exterior is flashy I think for a older car and it kind of gives it a minor sporty look mixed with style. The ride quality is excellent for a car of it's size and weight. And as the power on demand goes, their is no problem there. These cars have always been built with good engines- and it shows when you're passing up hill. No thinking about passing and getting ready for the hill with this car :)

 As for the minor stalling problem mentioned above- the boys at the GM dealer gave it a very long 'special' name which went in one ear and out the other with me. So it's safe to say it was a problem with an oxygen sensor (i believe) reading incorrectly. It would stall out if i was braking for a red light or if I got stuck in a drive through and turned the car off for a second. It was a pain but now it's fixed. We continue to get wonderful service from our Cutlass--- and it's a pleasure to drive!
