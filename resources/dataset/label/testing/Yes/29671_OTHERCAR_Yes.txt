            If you want a family car with good performance, the Buick Regal GS is worth your consideration.  Redesigned in late 1997 as a 1997 1/2, this Regal is beyond compare to the GM w-car it replaces.  The structure is stiffer and the quality has improved greatly. The 3800 six cylinder engine with the supercharger puts out 240 horsepower.  It tops an impressive list of standard features including: leather seating surfaces, dual zone climate control, traction control with anti-lock brakes, dual air bags, aluminum wheels, good sounding radio with a tape player, driver information center that includes a boost gauge, oil change warning, tire pressure warning, fuel range, instant mileage, overall mileage, three low fuel warnings and power everything. If you add on optional equipment: cd and tape radio with steering wheel controls, chromed aluminum wheels, sunroof, and HEATED seats the Regal is a premium car. Buick also has an innovative design on the trunk hinges, they do not enter the trunk space so the trunk can filled without worry of the hinges. Trips to the dealer have not been needed! The car has been trouble free. The Regal has conservative contemporary styled exterior. This vehicle will not only serve your family well, it will meet your performance &quot;needs&quot;. All for just over $25,000.<br><br>
