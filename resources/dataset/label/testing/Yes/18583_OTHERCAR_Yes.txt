            About a year and a half ago, my boyfriend bought me this camera for my birthday.  I didn't want anything fancy, I'm not a professional photographer, but I love to snap shots of just about anything.  I was previously known to be a terrible waster of film, as I liked to experiment in taking pictures to see if I could get certain things to turn out properly.  The worst part about doing that is it takes forever to get results.  Another reason why I wanted a digital camera rather than the traditional film camera was because I loved posting pictures online.  I'm also very impatient.  Waiting to finish the roll of film, then waiting for it to develop, then spending hours scanning the pictures just wasn't for me.  So I requested a "cheap" digital camera, just for the fun of it, and this is what I got.  

Since the camera was a gift, I'm not sure exactly how much it cost at the time, but I know it was in the $200-300(CAN) range. Since then the price of digital cameras has decreased, but I cannot seem to find a recent price listing for this camera.


<b>What I like about this camera</b>

I like the small size of this camera.  It is about 4 inches long and about 2.5 inches high.  This makes it convenient to carry, as it will fit nicely in a purse (assuming of course, the purse is not already crammed full like mine usually is!).

This camera is very easy to use.  There is an on/off button, and three settings.  The first setting is for taking pictures, the second is for viewing your pictures/videos, and the third is for taking videos.  

There are different features and settings (which I will not go into in detail) that can be accessed through the menu.  There is no zoom on this camera, but you can zoom into the picture after it has been taken.  I use this feature all the time to see if the picture is how I like it, since I have a tendency to use the pictures I take for my desktop on my computer.  The display screen on the camera is quite small, so sometimes you can't always see all of the details without zooming in.

This camera comes with a 16MB memory card for storing your pictures.  This is enough memory for anything I have ever used this camera for.  Someone I know who recently bought a digital camera was told that a 16MB memory card will only hold ten pictures.  Of course, that was for a different camera, so that may be true.  However, on my camera, the 16MB card will hold about 50 pictures (I counted once when it was full and it had 47 pictures).  That's equivalent to about two rolls of film.  For average use, this is more than enough.  The only way I would recommend buying a larger memory card is if you are going somewhere where you will be taking a lot of pictures and will not have access to a computer.  I recently went on a a vacation where I took a lot of pictures, but my boyfriend borrowed his friend's laptop so we just uploaded them to it whenever the memory card was full.  Storing the videos seems to take a LOT more memory than the pictures, so that is something you will want to keep in mind.

Uploading pictures to your computer with this camera couldn't be much easier.  The camera comes with a USB cable that plugs into the side of the camera.  Just plug the other end into a USB port on your computer, turn the camera on and the computer takes care of the rest.  All you will have to do is select which pictures you want to upload (they are all selected as default), and tell the computer where to put the pictures.  You may need to install the software that comes with the camera for this to work, but I did not have to.

This camera seems to be very sturdy.  I have dropped it several times.  My dog has knocked it off the coffee table a couple of times.  My cat managed to get the strap over his head and ran around like crazy, banging the camera on everything until I rescued him (I thought the camera was really done for that time).  Every time I am convinced that there is no way the camera could have survived the abuse it has been through - it does.  It has some scratches and small dings on it, but nothing that affects the use of it.

This camera has 2.0 megapixels.  I know that a lot of cameras now have much more than this, but I find this resolution to be adequate for me.  The pictures are still clear when I put them on my desktop, without graininess.  For regular prints, the picture quality is good enough that it looks like a regular film photograph (with a good printer, of course!).


<b>What I don't like about this camera</b>

First and foremost, this thing <b>eats</b> batteries.  The video option is especially hard on batteries, so I use it very sparingly.  I wanted a camera that used regular batteries - preferably AA (which this camera requires two of) rather than the lithium batteries since they cost an arm and a leg.  I have never actually counted how many pictures I could take until the batteries ran out, but I'm not sure how accurate that count would be.  The batteries run out faster if you use the LCD display while lining up your picture (I don't use this option), and like I said, they run out faster if you take videos as well.  The good thing is that the camera does not completely drain the batteries - they can still be used for some time in low power devices like remote controls - so don't throw them out, save them for later.  One of these days I am going to invest in rechargeable batteries for the camera.

Another thing I don't like is that there is no zoom.  But of course, that is because cameras with the zoom cost more, and I just didn't want a very expensive camera.  

I might like to use the video option more if there was sound to go with it - instead you just get twenty seconds of silent video.  Again, I could have had this option if I had wanted to spend more on the camera.

Pictures don't turn out very well in low light, even with the flash.  The video seems even worse in low light, because the flash just can't light up for that long.  


<b>Final Thoughts</b>

This is a good camera for an average user.  There is nothing fancy here - all you are going to get are the basics - but that's all I wanted.  The good thing about that is that the camera is extremely simple to use.

I use this camera a lot, especially for posting pictures online.  Because it is so easy to use and the pictures are so easy to upload to my computer, I can have pictures online within minutes of taking them.  

I have found this especially useful for EBay auctions.  Actually, this would be an excellent camera for someone who wants one just for this purpose.

Overall, a very good little camera for someone who isn't looking for anything too fancy.
