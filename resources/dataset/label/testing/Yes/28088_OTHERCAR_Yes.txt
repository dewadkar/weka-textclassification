            For my birthday this last summer, my husband insisted on getting me a digital camera. Don't get me wrong, I wanted one...I was just a tad concerned money-wise. Let's face it, these puppies aren't cheap by any means.
 
We did a LOT of research and finally decided on this little Gem from the wonderful people at Hewlett Packard. But we were a tad concerned about the $450 price tag. So we did a little investigating and found a great deal. We only paid $380. After receiving and using this camera, I have to say I would happily pay the $450. 

Camera Capabilities:
This little baby has all the bells and whistles you could possibly imagine. And even some you can't. I've been using it 3 months and I'm still stumbling upon features I never noticed before.
 
It boasts a wonderful 5.3 megapixel resolution with 3x optical and 7x digital zoom. A 1.5" LCD screen may sound small, but trust me, it's more than adequate. The LCD is also full color. Anything you need to do can be explained right on the LCD. Once you turn the camera on, you have 4 options. 

1;You can hit the "playback" button next to the screen to view pictures that are currently saved on your card.
 
2; You can hit the "live view" button next to the screen to get just that, a live view through your screen (think video camera). Although this sucks down the batteries quickly and I wouldn't suggest using it too often. 

3; You can hit the "print" button (again, next to the screen) to print pictures directly from your camera. This requires a connection from your camera to your printer via a USB cable (included in purchase).
 
There is also the option of purchasing a photo printer that is SD card ready. You can pop the card right out of your camera, into your printer and voila! pictures. We choose to do it the easier way. We have the USB cable hooked up to our computer. We plug it into the camera and the unload software automatically starts up and sucks our pictures out, allowing us to view them on our computer monitor before printing them out. This also allows you to retouch your photos if necessary. 

4; Don't like reading through a manual for explanations of a specific feature? No need. You can simply hit the "Ok" button on the back of the camera and use the arrow buttons to scroll through different options (such as lighting and color). And if there's one you're not sure about, you can click on "help" and it gives you a mini tutorial right on your screen. It explains what the feature is and suggests where and when to use it. 

Basic Functions: 
Auto Focus (great if you're not exactly camera savvy) 
Auto Exposure 
Auto Flash (there are three more flash options as well; no flash, fillflash and night.) 
Red Eye Reduction 

Sidenote: Red eye reduction works about as well as any 35mm point and shoot film camera. It doesn't guarantee that no one will have red eye. A lot of this depends on the conditions in which you're taking the picture and at what angle. For this reason, I would suggest investing in some sort of touch-up program. I use the Hewlett Packard imaging software that accompanied my purchase as well as PaintShop Pro 8. Paintshop Pro has many more features, but is also kind of complicated. And be warned, it is next to impossible to remove red eye from someone wearing contacts.
You can also use manual camera controls for more creativity.

Audio/Video Capture:
This camera is also equipped with audio and video capture. You can record an audio memo to go along with a still image simply by keeping the shutter button held down after you snap the picture. Once you're done talking, just release the button. Video capture has been so much fun. Bear in mind, the quality of your video clips will not be nearly as good as anything you'd get with a camcorder, but for such a small little camera, it gets the job done. The 32MB SD card that comes with this camera won't hold much in way of video clips. Or in pictures for that matter. If you want your camera set at it's highest resolution, the 32MB will only hold 11 pictures. My husband bought me a 256MB card and, although they're a tad on the pricey side (around $80) I strongly suggest getting one if you love taking lots of pictures. However, even with a card that size, you can only take 2 minutes of video at a time. BUT, I've never reached card capacity. Even after taking several 2 minute video clips. I'm not sure exactly how many it will hold. The SD cards are very easy to operate. There's a little door on the side of the camera that flips open and the cards pop right in and right back out. No getting stuck. 

For anyone who's wondering, this camera CAN be used with an optional docking system. 

There are more features than I can list here! It's simply an amazing camera. Durable, too. It's been dropped a couple times and still works without a glitch. I just took it out the other night to take pictures of the lunar eclipse. They came out great, by the way. 

Other Information:
I should comment that there are two versions of the 935. The 935xi is the exact same camera. The only difference is the software that's included. I would suggest purchasing one with the software as it makes things much simpler. 

Software Capabilities:
HP Imaging Software has a few really cool features. Once it's loaded onto your computer and you've set all of your preferences ( i.e. what drive you want your pictures stored on) a little window called the Photo and Imaging Director pops up and gives you 3 options; 

1: View and Print (this brings up the entire template of every picture you've unloaded from your camera).

2: Unload images (occasionally, if you're running other applications, the unload software won't pop up automatically when the camera's plugged in).

3: Help (this one's pretty self explanatory).
Once you've loaded up your picture template, there are any number of things you can do. Double clicking on a thumbnail brings up the full picture and gives you options such as removing red eye, cropping, resizing, rotating, brightening, adjusting picture contrast, etc...

Some concerns:
All in all, I'd have to say the only things I'd change would be battery life (although this is the fault of the batteries, not really the camera). I've also been a little worried about the lens cover. It's a very nice Pentax precision lens (one of the eye catchers when we were shopping). But the covering is nothing but two pieces of flimsy plastic that come together over the lens when the camera is shut off. Are they secure? No. You can run your finger over them and expose the lens completely. Therefore, I also suggest purchasing a camera case to keep it in at all times when not in use. And also keeping it away from small children. I made the mistake of leaving my 4 year old son alone in the same room with it. When I discovered the camera, it was so overheated it wouldn't even shut off. I had to pull the batteries and was terrified it would never be the same. But it certainly is a trooper. And it hasn't had any overheating problems since. Children have a way with electronics. 

One Final Perk:
This camera takes simple, AA Lithium Photo batteries. It CAN be used with regular AA's, but they don't last long at all. But thank God, no paying for super pricey batteries. I also own an SLR so I know how pocket emptying those things become. AA Lithium's only cost about $10 for a set of 4 (the camera takes 2). I've only had to purchase about three 4 packs in the last 3 months. And I use this baby a LOT. And with the money you'll be saving not paying for useless pictures, this camera is well worth every penny.
