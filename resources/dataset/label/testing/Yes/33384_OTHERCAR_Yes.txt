            The Volkswagon Jetta is a very reliable car.  It has many &quot;extra's&quot; such as a full spare tire, Four air bags (Two in the front and two on the side) which did not work when I got into a accident that totaled the car.
  The seat are very comfortable, you can put into many positions for back support.  The lights in the speedometer are blue, which is a good change from the original boring white light in every other car.
  The stereo system is great eight-speakers,6 cd changer,tape,am/fm radio.
The clock is where the speedometer is so you can just look down real quick.
  All in all the Jetta is a great car!!!<br><br>
