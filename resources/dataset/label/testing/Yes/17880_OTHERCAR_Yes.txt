            I just got a brand new 2000 Chevy Blazer, 4 door. Last week - 9 days ago to be exact. I've always wanted a Blazer, but couldn't afford it. As I was getting ready to start looking for a new car - all I could think about was a Blazer but still thinking it was way out of my price range. Well, come to find out, not if I lease it!

I went in on looking at the Blazer's with these must have's: 2 doors, silver (excuse me, Pewter), auto entry, power doors, windows, CD player. Called one dealer close to my work and they had one to match my demands. Test drive - I liked it but having to raise up the passenger seat every time anyone wanted to get to the back seat annoyed me.
Also, the panel between window and window scared me - no visibility.
I then test drove a 4 door 1999 model. Nice, smoother than 2 door, but it had 16,000 miles on it - program car. But, it was about 4-5,000 dollars cheaper than a 2000 model.

Two days later I went to another dealer (Jackson Chevrolet, Middletown, CT), and test drove a Pewter 2000 - 4 door. Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!Made my decision right then and there. I thought it would take forever to get used to - like it would feel like I was driving a Mac truck or something. Nope. No different than my old car (a 1995 Chevy Cavalier). I'm still not used to parking but I'm sure I'll get it perfect in another week or two. It's not much wider than a car, actually it's not as wide as my mother's car (1995 Pontiac Bonneville). The steering is very, very easy, going into 4 wheel drive and back down to two wheel is as easy as pushing a button. Stereo and controls are very accesible.

I even picked it up in a snow storm and have had two since and no problem. Had trouble getting up driveway - the quick push of a button into 4 wheel drive and I was up to the top in seconds.

Bad point - Gas guzzler - I've already put $50 worth of gas - $1.50-55 a gallon is high but come on. I never put more than $20 in one week in my old car. Back door is slightly heavy to close. Not big problems but the only cons I have.

So, if I still like it in 3 years - It's mine for only $16,000 more! (ha ha). I'm thinking a brand new Blazer. 


Now, all I have to do is keep my family away from it - they keep wanting to take it for a spin!
