            We wanted to get a digital camera that would not make us poor, because we would not use it every day but just for fun, and of course it should be quite easy to use. We also had some compact flash cards at home already, so we intensified our search for cameras that would be able to use compact flash cards as digital storage.

Basically there are a lot of good cameras around right now (Olympus in particular). But when comparing the picture results on some review websites (i.e. www.steves-digicams.com), we always came back to consider the A20 as the one with the best output, even when it came to compare the camera to other models with higher pixel resolution in the same price range (i.e. Kodak). 

The camera is very easy to use and just plain fun. It allows you to play somewhat around with the settings, but most of the time you will just point and shoot the picture anyway. The software that comes with the camera is very nice and easy to use. It would have been of course nicer if it actually came with some editing software as well, like the higher priced Canon models.

I do recommend the purchase of some good NiHM rechargeable batteries, they will last a very long time. Otherwise you will have to spend a fortune in alkaline batteries at the store. It is a good thing though that you can use the alkalines as well, because in case of need you can just buy them at any corner store or gas station.

Another point that I regret a little is that the macro function of the A20 is not as nice as for other cameras (Olympus). But you can purchase some accessories (lenses) that might do the trick.

My only real con is the size of the camera. I would have wished for a smaller size. But when I compared the picture quality to the Digital Elph (very small Canon, a little higher priced), we were disappointed. So we went with the A20, considering that the end result of the picture was more important to us than the size of the camera.
