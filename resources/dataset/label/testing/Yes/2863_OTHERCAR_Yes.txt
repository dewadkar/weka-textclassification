            I was looking at purchasing a digital camera for the past 6 months and couldn't decide if I should purchase a 4.0+ megapixel camera or a 3.0+ megapixel camera.  One of my concerns was that the majority of the 4.0+ megapixel cameras were the size of a standard SLR camera.  However, I didn't want to lose picture quality by choosing a smaller (and fewer megapixel) camera.  

So, after much consideration I decided to purchase the Nikon 3500.  I liked the small size because it fits in a pocket and from the articles I have read, 3.0 megapixel cameras are able to produce wonderful pictures up to 8x10s.  

To start with, the Nikon 3500 comes with everything you need to download and edit pictures on your computer (cables, software, battery, battery charger, Compact Flash chip), so you don't have to spend an extra $50-$75 on equipment.  The downside is that the supplied Compact Flash card is only 16MB and doesn't hold many high-quality images.  

During the initial battery charging (2 hours) I completely read the manual (very easy to understand) and was taking pictures immediately.  The auto setting seems to work well under all conditions, however there are 12 pre-programmed settings for special lighting situations (sunrise/sunset, fireworks, portraits, night portraits, indoor, landscape, night landscape, etc.).  These pre-programmed settings adjust the camera automatically to get the best results under the specific lighting conditions.  This makes the camera virtually foolproof.  In addition to the 12 pre-programmed settings, you can also manually adjust the camera, giving advanced users more control over their images.  

Once I was done shooting, I plugged the supplied USB cable into my camera and downloaded the images to my computer by pushing one button.  Again, very easy.  The supplied editing software has common features such as removing red-eye, cropping, and blowing up images, but doesn't have as many features as professional editing software packages such as Adobe Photoshop (or Elements).  But for the every-day user, the software works fine and is easy to use.  

The results were impressive.  Very clear pictures with bright vivid colors.  I printed my pictures on a Hewlet Packard 7550 and I could not tell the difference between a 35mm print and the digital print.  I'm very happy with the camera thus far.  They only criticism I have is that it is very easy for a user to put his/her fingerprints on the lens.  It takes a little practice to learn to avoid doing, this, but it can be done.
