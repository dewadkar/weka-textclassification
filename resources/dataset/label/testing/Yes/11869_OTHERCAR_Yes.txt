                 The 2000 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport gives you the best of both worlds.  This car is a four door with hatch back and gives plenty of room in the front or back seats.  The back seats split 2/3 and 1/3 which allow you to place larger items in the hatch back and still allow a person to sit in the back seat.  All wheel drive is an important feature of this car which has saved me a lot of grief on wet roads.  I'm very excited to see what this car can do in a Michigan winter.
     On the other hand, this car has a unique look and impressive power.  Over the years, Subaru has had a knack of taking small 4 cylinder engines and making them feel much like a 6 cylinder machine.  It feels and handles like a sports car, and you forget your driving a 4 door.  As your cruising around curves and corners, you drift away and enjoy the ride.  In this time of high has prices, 28 mpg on the highway is an added benefit.
    I compared this car to several others including the Ford Focus and Pontiac Grand Am, and neither one really compared.  If your interested in purchasing this car, you can compare it against anything, because no others compare.<br><br>
