            We can all dream about the Nikon D1x,the Canon D series cameras, but come on now. If you are a professional Sports, or roving journalist, than the above models most certainly are the way to go. For the rest of us who want that SLR feel and performance, the E10 is just perfect price wise, and performance wise. (I also have a Canon G-2 which I enjoy very much.) The E10 carries on further with its terrific build quality. Very little plastic here on this camera. An Aluminum casting for the body adds durability,helps isolate the camera from electrical noise that could corrupt the cameras ops. It also serves as a CCD heat sink of sorts too. With the weight comes better shots because with more substantial weight, you lessen the chance of camera shake. Ergonomics are very good though not perfect. The vertical body especially where the grip falls to hand is too short for my big hands. Solution? I bought the Li/Po Battery pack and vertical grip. Wow, much real estate for my big hands. Feels more secure in my hands now. I don't have any issues with the vertical shutter release because it works fine in my hands. Not to mention also the extended battery life. My battery is the 8400 mAH type. The construction of the grip holder is a bit cheap though. A higher grade plastic would have been better. The instructions were interesting to read through, though I pretty much figured out what I needed. The LCD screen is exposed and easily scratched. I would have liked to have a cover to keep it from getting scratched. An eye cup for eyeglass wearing photographers would be welcome too. The Lens is the E-10s greatest asset I think. The pictures taken with this lens are just terrific. The focus ring feels positive with no end play, and the zoom ring works great too. Using a non powered zoom saves batteries too. And I understand this camera doesn't need any more power eating features than is here now. Control operation is at times a little curious though. Using that secondary knob to switch almost everything can be annoying. Taking pictures, the results are absolutely much better than I expected. Color and detail are outstanding. I can't wait for the next air shows to come so I can get some great pictures. Using all the modes are simple and quick. I use the Manual mode most of the time. I am just used to it and the Aperture and Shutter priority, and Program mode are nice for my friends whom may take pictures for me from time to time. Play back is just silly slow. The LCD could also give better detail. My G-2 has a better display. In the final analysis, the E-10 is an excellent companion for capturing those special moments where you want to take your time getting that just right picture. I am not convinced it is the first choice for in a hurry snap it now kind of work. My Canon G-2 will do that well. So overall, some quirks and silly long playback times, the E-10 is highly recommended for its terrific photographic performance.
