            After I sold my "99 Grand Am, I set out to buy a bigger car. Since I owned & love my Pontiac, stands to reason I'd upgrade to a '99 or newer Grand Prix, right?  Wrong, I had set my sights on the '96 Grand Prix because it was the last year they made the old body style which I think has much more appeal than the GPs that are out there now.  I had a hard time finding the '96 GP in the 2-dr & an even harder time finding one with low miles.  I searched the net & was lucky to find one with 68k miles 1.5 hrs away from home.  I have owned this car for 2 years now & it has over 100k on it.  NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER!  My car has the smaller 6 cylinder so it's fairly good on gas.  She's starting to lose a little torque, but I consider this to be expected given the high miles.  The headlights tend to be pricey & heaven forbid you try to replace the spark plug wires yourself- believe me it's an all day job due to their inconvenient location! And as luck would have it, the darn mice got into the car a week later & chewed them up again!  They must taste good! My car handles very well in all seasons.  The headlights need cleaning often in slushy or snowy weather as they are set back & seem to gather whatever Mother Nature is dishing out.  My only other complaints are my power seat & intermittent wipers have a few glitches & no longer have all the positions they once did.  The style more than makes up for these little inconveniences...  Each time I approach or leave my car in a parking lot, I literally think "Man that's a hot car!"
