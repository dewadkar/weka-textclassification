            The Hyundai Sonata is more than worth the money.  I own the '99  basic model: automatic,4 cylinders, power everything plus cruise control.  The main reason at first as to why I bought this vehicle was the warranty they offer.  10 years power-train warranty, 5 years unlimited mileage road side assistance, 5 years or 60,000miles bumper to bumper, and more.  I give good maintenance to it, so if anything else happens I know I'll be covered.  I was sick and tire of getting lemons every time I bought a used car (my luck!).  Once I drove it, I was convinced I made a good decision.  Great handling (doesn't drag), smooth ride, you can barely feel the bumps or pot-holes (unless they are really deep!).  Can't complain about the suspension, so far it's been great driving. At high speeds (already got a ticket!) the wind can be heard slightly but again play some music and it's gone.  It's 2.4 liter engine does deliver speed.  140 m/h top speed, for a 4 cylinder it's pretty good.  Mileage so far it's been of about 27 miles per gallon (city and highway driving) according to my calculations.  I drive a lot, so I really pay attention to this detail (about 350 miles a week).  The interior is very roomy except the back seat, I've heard my friends say it's a little crowded but that depends on how tall you are (or big like those friends of mine!).  A/C is great, last summer I had no problem dealing with the hot humid weather of the Great Lakes.  (Contains no FCC's so is environmentally friendly).  The heater works great as well, doesn't take long to heat up (at least inside the garage).  Snow is coming this way and so far no problem handling the cold.  The defrost function works excellent, it's quick.  No foggy windows either even when it's raining.  Has wide headlights so the illumination is great, no problem seeing what's in front of you.  The only thing that bothers me are the breaks, they are metallic and they make a bit of a noise during the first 3 or 4 stops, but after that the noise is gone.  May be it's just my car.  Don't know if it happens to other car owners.  For 15,500 dls (by this time, they have better deals, you might get it cheaper) it is really worth it.  If you buy it to keep it til it falls apart! like like I did, then don't worry about the low resale price, other wise it may not be worth it for you.  Great mileage, comfortable to drive for long periods of time, fast, responds quickly.  If 15000 dls (more or less) is your price range, you should certainly at least test drive this vehicle, compare warranties, and then make the decision.  May not be a great car company but it's certainly a well built car.<br><br>
