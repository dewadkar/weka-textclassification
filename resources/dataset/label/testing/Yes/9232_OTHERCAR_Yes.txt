            Ok, ok.. I saw this car and fell in love with it. I think that is one of the first things that people tell you NOT to do when you are on a new car lot.. To be completely honest, when I was on the lot, I had NO intent of buying anything. I was just there waiting for an oil change on my XT6. However, I have wanted an Impreza 2.5RS since they first hit the markets here in the US in '98. I was a bit hesitant at the time to buy one but, throwing caution to the wind I bought it and I can honestly say that I don't regret it one bit.

As far as the love/hate relationship with vehicle, here's what I have so far. 

Love-wise, I must say that this is a FUN car to drive! Especially if you can drive a 5-speed. I did have the opportunity to drive the automatic and prefer the 5-speed. It has a lot of low-end torque for 'get up and go' as well as enough speed to get away from you quickly if you don't watch out! (I caught myself going about 95 down the local highway.. didn't even notice it..) This is a nice solid-feeling vehicle. It feels quite safe in whatever weather is thrown at it. I have not had the opportunity to drive it in the snow yet, but if it handles anything like it does in every other situation I am sure that it will be great!  This car feels like it has a hand holding it onto the road around corners..  Everything  is  in logical positions ergonomicaly.. I really didn't have to hunt for anything except the 'parking light switch' because of the angle of the steering wheel I could not see it. (However, having another Subaru I was able to locate it pretty easily..) Gas milage seems pretty good too.. I get about 22/27..

Hate-wise, I really can't think of anything that I would say that I HATE about this car. I do have a couple of things that would be nice to have different, though. First, I think the radio controls are a bit hard to reach and out-of-the-way.. you have to take your eyes off of the road pretty far to change the radio station.. that, and the stereo is hard to get sounding right.. I got the 'tweeter kit' in mine and it almost makes it seem like you have too much treble or too little.. 

Overall, I think this is a great vehicle for someone who wants a fun car to drive, but doesn't want some beheamoth that eats gas. This is more of a 'practical fun' car.. it's really sporty car but it won't leave you stuck off in a ditch or spinning all over the place in the winter time. The price is a little on the hefty side (MSRP of mine was about $21k) but I think it's worth it.. if you are a bit more frugal you might want to check out the Impreza L.. still a great car! 

Also, this is a great car if you want to be noticed. This is the first vehicle that I have owned that people who I don't know will stop me and comment on it.. :) (Hey guys!! Women seem to LOVE this car.. :)

If you are going to be transporting people around quite frequently, though, you might want to opt for the Legacy.. The back seats are fine for short trips but would probably be medieval torture if you had to be in them longer then 1/2 hour or so.. (especially if you are tall like me.. ) <br><br>
