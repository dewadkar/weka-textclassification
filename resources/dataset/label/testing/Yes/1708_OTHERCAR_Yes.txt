            For people in the market looking for a hybrid car and SUV the Honda CRV is a nice, reliable choice. It's roomy for both passengers and cargo and rides more like a car than the average truck-based SUV. For people who don't want to be bothered with shifting into 4WD, the CRV automatically senses slipping and engages the assistance of all 4 wheels--no buttons to push or hubs to lock. It's average mpg with combined city and highway driving is 23-24 mpg. The CRV is based on the Honda Civic platform and therefore handles and rides like a car with the added benefits of AWD (referred to as &quot;real time 4WD) and generous cargo space. The rear seats fold flat for additional cargo space with two quick moves. The only complaint from this writer is the lack of horsepower. The CRV has a 4 cyl engine with 127 hp (the newer 98-99 model has an upgraded engine in the EX model that turns out 145 hp)I have not yet driven this model but dealers have told me that the increased hp is barely noticeable to most. The &quot;grade-logic&quot; control, which automatically locks the transmission into the required gear according to the incline, assists in maintaining speed but it also is an annoyance to have the engine shift fairly frequently in order to accomplish this goal. When using the cruise control, the vehicle loses speed on sharp hills and you must resort to the gas pedal to maintain speed. The seats are comfortable (even if Consumer Reports didn't think so in their last CRV profile) and the Honda stereo is above average. One other picky thing--the driver can control all 4 windows; however, the control is on the dash to the left of the steering wheel and is difficult to find; especially at night as it is not illuminated.  Overall, this a great vehicle for city, highway or minor off road driving. It's also easier on the budget than most SUVs (aside from the tinny Kia sportage or unreliable Geo tracker) as its price ranges from $19,500-$22,000.<br><br>
