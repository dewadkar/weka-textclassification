            I have been pining for a digital camera for about a year now. Luckily for me I (read my fianc�e and I) received it the Canon A20 as a gift from everyone at our wedding shower.

As we opened the box I was amazed at the small size; about 11.cm x 7.5 cm x 5 cm (or if you prefer 4.5� x 3� x 2�). The cameras I have been using at work are about twice this size. 

The other wonderful thing about this camera is how easy it is to use. There are 4 modes: Auto, Manual, Stitch Assist and Playback. 

<b>Auto mode</b> is somewhat idiot proof, it's close but I am a very experienced idiot. In this mode the camera decides what settings to use, and it works well.
<b>Manual mode</b> allows you to set the more advanced settings by yourself (i.e. exposure, white balance, focus lock, flash, etc.)
<b>Stitch Assist mode</b> is brilliant. In this mode the LCD viewfinder displays the rightmost third or so of the last image captured as well as the current target. This makes it very easy to line up shots for later stitching on the computer.
<b>Playback mode</b> is for viewing images captured. The menus and functions are simple and logical. 

The features of the A20 are great. It has 2.1 mega-pixel resolution, just starting to get silly, on the highest settings the images are 1200 by 1600 pixels and fine resolution. The 3 times optical combined with the 2.5 digital zoom gives a combined zoom of 7.5 times. The camera cycles through the optical range first then enhances the image with the digital zoom. The continuous shooting mode will take save an image every 2.5 seconds in large (image)/fine (resolution) mode. The software package is easy to use and has some nice features.  A flash card reader is not required, the USB cable downloads quickly. A Video cable is supplied for displaying directly to a TV.

The A20 comes with an 8 meg flash card, I would definitely recommend at least 32 meg card. If the camera is set to Large/fine mode I managed to squeeze in 60 images. This will of course vary with the colour differences in photos taken. 60 high quality images is a lot, especially when you just toss the ones you don�t like.

The cheapo alkaline batteries I used on the first day lasted for forty of fifty photos (and about a thousand playbacks with the LCD). I have not had any issues with the rechargeable batteries, ours came with car and wall charging units, if I purchase another set there should be no trouble.

All in all I am very impressed by this camera. Apparently my friends did a great deal of research. If you are in the market for a digital give this one a serious look.
