            My family just recently purchased a 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4.0 liter.  It was a very nice vehicle but it does not seem like it will be a good one to drive for 100,000's of miles.  We have done put it in the shop for problems with the locks.  They would not <br>unlock sometimes.  Now it makes a loud clicking noise when drove, and the fan is extremely loud.  I can hear it in the driveway kicking on and off.   We have done went through all of this and it just now clicked over to 25,000 miles.  It is a very comfortable <br><br>car, a little cramped in the back though.  It is not at all quite very loud engine, and it does not take corners very well.  It takes about $25-30 dollars to fill it up with gas and that will last almost a week.  It is a very good vehicle to go camping in.  It came with a <br><br>tent that attaches to the trunk so you can sleep in your vehicle if you wish.  In the end I would not purchase another Jeep Cherokee Sport.  I would probably go with a Honda  CRV.<br><br><br>
