            I purchased the Olympus 460Z digital camera on the internet mainly due to its price ($399) in comparison to others.  I've only had the camera a week but I couldn't be more pleased with it.  I am a novice when it comes to photography and electronics and yet I was able to complete the set-ups on the camera in about 30 minutes and was taking excellent pictures in just a couple of hours.  I am using it essentially as a point and shot camera but it has many more features that I am  just beginning to use.
It comes with software for your PC which makes downloading, editing and printing a breeze.  The only drawback I have found thus far is the amount of time it takes to download pictures from the camera to the PC.  I intend to purchase a USB reader/writer for about $60. to solve this problem.
The camera comes with very clear and concise instructions.  There is a four page flyer that allows you to begin experimenting with the camera immediately. That is backed up with a 100+ page manual that is easy to read and use.
I would highly recommend this camera to beginners like myself who are not particularly adept with technology and/or photography.
