            I bought my 1996 Honda Accord LX brand new.  It was Black with tinted windows, gray interior, power windows and locks with a tape player.  I can honestly say it was the best car I ever had. It was my very first brand new car, my family are all honda owners and had recommened me to get it, I was twenty-one at the time, so I personally feel this car is good for any age, it's sporty yet very practical.  
I had the car for two years when someone did not stop at a stop sign and smacked right into me, The air bags deployed and the engine dropped just as it was supposed to and kept me from getting seriously hurt.  I would not have wanted to be in any other car when that had happened.  The Insurance company decided to fix the car rather than to total it out because the book value of the car was still very high.  But as we all know a car is never truly the same after it has been in a accident, so I decided to get rid of it and purchased yet another honda, I decided to go with the CRV and as much as I also enjoyed that I preferred my accord so much better.  I personally do not care for the body styles of the new accords however I am sure the they are true to there name and will buy another again soon.<br><br>
