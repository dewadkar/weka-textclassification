            Having to replace my 10 year old '89 Jeep Cherokee Laredo was the hardest thing I had to do.  It was a work-horse, and aside from a failing electrical system, it still powered through the day.  But after one child in the family, it just didn't have the room for a car seat, dog, and all the things you need to lug along with a baby.

Originally, I was headed for the Suburban.  But at a $485 / month lease, you're talking a lot of dough for just an extra 2 feet in length while you can get a quote for $410 on Chevy's web site for the Tahoe.

A V-8 Vortek engine provides pickup enough to beat many cars off the line at a red light (not that you'd want to do this with family in the car, of course) and it rides smoothly.  I handles like a truck should, but people who prefer to drive cars will feel comfortable with the handling.  

I'd recommend getting the middle flip-down seat in the front, as well, instead of the console.  The seat acts as a good arm rest, and opens up with enough room for 6 CD's, and 12 cassette tapes, as well as your tokens and change for the tolls on the road.  Also, it has a writing pad, and a recessed place for something a little bigger than a pack of cards (perfect for a cell phone).

The glove compartment is a little small, but that can't be said about the rest of the truck.  Baby, baby seat, dog (with enough room to move around), two strollers, fold-up crib, two suitcases, a wagon, two beach chairs, and beach toys all fit comfortably, without blocking the rear window.

(I also prefer the bay-doors in the rear instead of the pickup-truck type fold down)

Push-button 4-wheel drive is nice and switches without a hitch.  Handling is nice on the highways and on small streets, gas mileage on long trips approaches 22 mpg, while you're looking at probably 17 mpg if you only do short jaunts.
