            I have a 1992 GL. I have not had it long enough to write of it's longevity but at 103,000 miles, it must have SOME life in it. The edition that I have is neither roomy or quiet. The four cylinder engine is a bit noisy but here again, it is 103K miles old!
My biggest peeve is with the plastic headlight housings. Plastic lenses tend to become cloudy over time and cleaning them to remove the glaze is nearly impossible. The local Ford dealership advised me that they were not servicable and that I should replace them....at roughly $50 a pop.
The passive restraint system does not operate and the shoulder belts hang uselessly from the brackets that are frozen into position.
I guess this sounds like a real bashing but it's not as bad as all that. The engine while a bit noisy is solid and delivers more power than some newer 4s I've driven. The sound system is quite good and the stock speaker placement was well designed. The transmission is smooth for a compact and once again, the fact that it still performs well at it's age is a testament to those who designed and built it.
If I had my choice, I'd sure change those headlight lenses to glass and install basic manual shoulder harnesses. <br><br>
