            When looking for a new car, I test drove the Ford Focus. The car has some neat features such as the removable back seat and adjustable steering wheel and seats. It is very roomy too. I am not too keen on the 3 door or the wagon models, but the sportier sedan is a descent looking car. As far as handling goes, this car rides very smoothly and comfortably. Basically, this is a well built fun car with a reasonable price tag. I found out from the dealer that, although the marketing is aimed at the college aged crowd, most of the buyers are not in this target market.<br><br>
