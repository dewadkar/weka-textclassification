            As a first digital camera, I feel that the Polaroid Photomax 640 with ImageMaker software is tops.  At under $200(at Wal-Mart), it has all the features that a novice could want. It features a wide range of resolution options, allowing from 12 to 96 images to be stored on the memory card.  It has three range settings and 4 flash settings.  I have used mine for about three months and have had wonderful results.  My only complaint is the loss of sharpness in enlargements. The ImageMaker software has many options for making and printing pictures, such as printing multiple copies, and multiple sizes of a picture on a single sheet of paper.  The software also allows you to email your pictures with music, great frames and backgrounds.  I would recommend this package to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive first digital camera that does a lot of things that the more expensive cameras do. <br><br>
