            I got my Freelander at the beginning of May, 2002.  The ride is nice, yet, it struggles a bit going uphill.  It would be great if Land Rover could add more horsepower.  The independent suspension adds great comfort for the passengers, this technology is similar to the BMW X5.  The "CommandShift" is standard for all, it was designed by BMW engineers.

There are some minor problems that I find with mine.  Firstly, the air vent for the front leg seats are located at the center of the vehicle, therefore, the foot that is closer to the center is always hotter or colder than the other one (depending on which side you're sitting at).  The interior craftsmanship raised some doubts.

Secondly, I upgraded the speakers to Harmon/Kardon, it gives very rich sound.  Yet, the subwoofer doesn't give as much as I expected.  

The release of the brakes gives a very odd sound, I went to the dealership to find out the cause... they explained to me that it is one of those things that I have to live with.  I drove their Freelander courtesy car, I discovered it's not an uncommon issue with this model.  Freelander has a three year dealer warranty, the dealer is happy to fix it up.

Otherwise, this soft off-roader is very eye-catching.  The fuel consumption is not as bad as I thought.  The best feature of this vehicle is the dent resistant bumpers.... Although there is the lack of arm rests for the front passengers, I personally don't find it uncomfortable.  At first, the leather seats might feel a bit high, but as the padding get worked in, they give good support.  Regular maintenance is not that bad, it uses synthetic oil, therefore, only need an oil change every 20,000KM.  When I do the math, it's the same as using non-synthetic oil (considering non-synthetic oil requires oil change every 5,000KM).
