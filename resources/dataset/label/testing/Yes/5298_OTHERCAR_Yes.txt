            I have been driving Honda's for several years now and I must say i would never drive anything else. They have so many wonderful features it is hard to name them all! 
First I would have to say comfort and secondly complete peace of mind. I purchased a '98 Accord LX in May 1998 and it has been great. It is roomy enough for 2 adults in front and a car seat and 2 more adults in back. It is very quiet inside, very good visibility, quite nice to look at, and a joy to drive. It comes with dual airbags, AC, automatic windows, CD player and many many features.
If you are about to buy a new car just make your first stop the nearest Honda dealer!<br><br>
