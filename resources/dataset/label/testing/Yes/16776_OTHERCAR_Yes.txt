            I would like to express my opinion on the Lincoln Town Car. I purchased my first Lincoln and have never been sorry.I had heard that they are just wonderful!They are, living up to their reputation!On long trips I never get as tired as I did with my other cars.On my tune up, all I needed was spark plugs! Other than changing the oil,they are virtually maintenance free.When and If I ever need to buy another Lincoln, the only changes I will make are the color, and maybe a little shorter one.I highly recommend them to anyone looking for comfort!The gas mileage is great also!<br><br>
