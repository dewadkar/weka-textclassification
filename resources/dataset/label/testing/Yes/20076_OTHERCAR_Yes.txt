            I have waited a long time to write this review. I really wanted to have a good feel for the camera before I put my 2 cents about it on the web, so now that I have taken 1200+ pictures in all conditions I think I finally have a good basis for which to write a review.

The basic idea of this camera is to replace your standard SLR camera with a digital version. Interchangeable lenses makes this digital camera shine from the rest, in fact if you are a previous Canon owner then you more then likely already have several lenses which you can use with this camera. That is one of the major reasons I choose this camera, after owning an ELAN 2e I didn't want to have to start buy new lenses for a new type of camera, so I got the 10d.

Overall the camera acts as any film camera should, you have a series of automatic modes, and then you have the manual modes (Aperture priority, shutter priority, manual). If you have any experience in photography it should be a breeze to pickup and start shooting, or if you don't then what way better to learn then on a camera where you don't have to print every single picture you take and can see what mistakes you made instantly with the LCD screen on the back?

The LCD screen is how you access certain functions, like changing what quality of picture you are taking and etc. It has 5 different brightness settings that working in all lighting, the brightest setting being high enough that you can see the screen in sunlight. Also you can adjust white balance manually, color temperature, exposure compensation, all with a push of a button and a twist of the wheel on the back of the camera used to navigate through the menu system.

Quality; I am different then a lot of other people apparently, I only shoot in RAW format. I think the benefits of RAW are beyond comparison, you get the picture at full resolution (3072x2048), but also you get the option to apply any of the options that the camera applies (sharpness, contrast, color adjustments, digital exposure) normally when the pictures is recorded, after the fact. You can fine tune your photo using the same processes the camera would use while you&#146re shooting, but at your leisure if you think it will help the photo out.

People have brought up issues of the camera being very soft when viewed at full resolution; this is actually due to the lenses they are using is my belief. The camera takes such detail that you can actually tell a cheap lens from an 'L' series professional grade lens. So the softness is the same you would see on a film camera if you blew up the picture or scanned it at high resolutions when using a cheaper lens.

The camera also has a couple of feature that I personally enjoy. The backlight on the display (not the LCD) is very bright and makes it easy to see when shooting at night. The ISO ranges from 100 to 3200, up to 400 is good for clean prints, up to 1600 isn't so grainy that I wouldn't use the picture in a photo album, at 3200 though I just can't use the photo, the grain is to bad. Also it senses when the camera is tilted and rotates the photos for you, which is awesome.

I love this camera; it has traveled 3,000+ miles with me, and taken 1,200+ pictures. I have printed beautiful 8x10 pictures and all sizes smaller. I highly recommend it, if it is within your budget. Also I think you should pick up a 1gig flash card while you&#146re at it, you can fit 165+ RAW pictures on it.
