            We have owned an EX since December 2000 and driving this van is a breeze (even for short people like my wife); it steers like a car.  All the seats are very comfortable and there's lots of leg room for the first 2 rows.  Keep the shortest people in the last row :-)  Even with all three seats up, there's so much room in the trunk!  Most of the controls are easy, but the "Auto" features in the Air-Conditioning system takes a little while to get used to.

I prefer Odyssey's seats to regular bucket seats, especially for the long drives.  We drove to Virginia one weekend and we all arrived pretty comfortably.  Even with 7 people and lots of luggage, the van was great.  The V6 is a critical piece of this van, and its very quiet.
This van has most of the features to keep the driver happy on a long drive.  Stereo is great, including volume controls on the steering wheel; the dashboard is clutter-free.  Drink holders are OK but the cigarette lighter is all the way at the bottom so I can't plug in my phone easily.

For passengers, there's lot of leg room; the second row passengers can stretch their legs between the front row seats.  2nd row seats can be kept together or separate and are not very hard to move around.  A great standard feature is that most of the windows have a dark tint.

Parking is a bit tight in our garage, there's 2-3 inch clearance on each side but the outside mirrors can be folded in for more room.

A word of Caution:  Please make sure that passengers, especially children, are clear of the power-sliding doors.  These doors do not detect people or other objects and so they do not stop from closing unless something obstructs it from closing all the way.  I know some Chrysler mini-vans have this feature, I hope Honda adds it soon.

I had driven my friend's 1999 Odyssey so I already knew it was a pretty good van.  The hardest part of getting this van was convincing my wife this was the right choice.  She did not want to be another "soccer-mom with a minivan".  Now she agrees that this was the right thing to do instead of a station-wagon.

The second hardest part could have been getting the van because of a backlog that all the dealers told me about.  Plus, some of them were trying to sell me Navigation System, which I did not want.  But I got lucky because one buyer had cancelled the order and I took it.  Instead of 2-3 months, I got the van in 3 days.

If you live in Delaware area and are looking to buy this van, I recommend good people at Colonial Honda in Perryville, MD.  We have bought Hondas from there before, and I'm sure we will buy them again from there.
