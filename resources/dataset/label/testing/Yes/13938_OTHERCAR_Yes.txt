            I love this car! I had a '92 Legacy sedan that served me very well, my son now has that car. The '98 seems familiar yet so much more refined. The 2.5L engine is a definite step up from the good 2.2L. One of the things I love about the car is that it's a 5-speed. My last 3 vehicles were automatics, when driving those for some reason I really missed driving a manual. I absolutely enjoy driving this car. One thing I wonder about though is why the gearing is so high, at 65mph the engine is running around 3200 rpm. The '92 Legacy runs around 2300 at that speed. The 2.5 L engine certainly has enough torque to get away with lower gearing. Still, overall mileage with mostly highway has been 23-25 mpg. I consider that very good for an AWD vehicle. Seats are very good, I really like the slightly high stance of the car along with a seat height adjustment. The ride quality is just a notch below the '92, maybe because of a heavier duty suspension. This car is definitely quieter than the '92. There's an impressive amount of room for a vehicle of this size. Fold down the back seats and there's enough room for 2 bikes. It's starting to get cold here in Connecticut, and the heated seats are great. Haven't really needed to try the heated outside mirrors yet. I bought this car used in June of 2003 with about 62k. My son's '92 has about 118k and still runs great, and other Subaru owners have reported their cars are running well with mileage even over 150k. The stereo is great, I never thought there could be so much bass without large speakers mounted behind the seats using a the trunk are to enhance the bass frequencies. I would highly recommend this car as a used purchase.
