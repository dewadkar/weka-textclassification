            I've had plenty of experience dealing with Toyota Camries, seeing as how my parents own two of them.  The Camry was the car I learned how to drive in, and it made it very easy for me.  Everything in the Camry is easy to find and operate.  It's a pretty good car, with a fair amount of room inside, and a lot of trunk space too.  We rarely ever take the car to the shop; only one of the two has ever been to the shop, as I can recall.  This car is great for the average sized family.  Its built for exactly that, however it is pretty powerful for a family car, if I do say so myself.  We own two LE models of the Toyota Camry, and they both have V6 engines.  So even though they're a practical car, its still a pretty good car for all you racers out there.  
The Toyota Camry was also rated as just about the safest car out there for about the past two years.  I do feel pretty secure driving this car, and so far haven't really had any problems with it.
Honestly, I think this car is best for parents, anyone who has a family, or anyone thats about middle aged.  True, its a great car, but I wouldn't recommend this car for the younger generation.  I'm looking into buying a car right now, and I wouldn't really focus on the Camry.  Maybe its because I'm so used to it, but it just doesn't appeal to me as a car I'd be willling to buy for myself.  However, as for recommending it to others, this one's definitely a good car to consider.<br><br>
