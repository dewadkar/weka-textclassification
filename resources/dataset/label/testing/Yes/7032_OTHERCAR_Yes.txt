            The LS is luxurious, extremely comfortable both back and front, and it is quiet -- if one hasn't experienced the quiet of an LS, there is simply nothing to compare it to. Even at legal limits (and then some), it is quiet. One doesn't have to turn up the music to hear it when entering the freeway. Speaking of the music -- even the standard system produces incredible sound, better than most home systems. (It is the equal of our system which has Bose speakers and Sony-Technics components.) I would assume the Nakamichi is even better.

The power train is outstanding. The engine is powerful and smooth, the transmission quiet, smooth and has easy "notch" shifting to take off the overdrive and downshift.

The seats are extremely comfortable both front and back. Both front seats are eight-way adjustable, including a lumbar support. The front headrests and seat belt height are also power adjusted. The back seat can fit three adults but are at their best with two adult passengers. For those over 6', head room in the back (with the moonroof) can be tight. However, leg room is not a problem regardless of how far back the front seat is set. There are 2 pop-up drink holders in the front and 2 in the back. The steering wheel adjusts up and down and telescopes for ideal setting.

The optional driver memory system remembers and resets at the push of a button, the exact driver seat, steering wheel, headrest, seat belt height, and outside mirrors adjustments. Especially nice after the guys at the car wash change absolutely everything!

The heating-air conditioning (A/C is of course standard) is great, especially because the driver and passenger side are independent -- and this is easily overriden when one is driving alone. 

The center storage compartment in the front has two levels: one for the phone (we have one, but it is analog and we don't even have it activated -- but it also is a great place to keep the cell phone) and then, below that and opening separately, is a spacious storage space. Good for sunglasses, shavers, etc. The pull-down arm rest in the rear has the pop-out tray for two drinks.

The instruments and controls are exceptionally well laid out. Virtually everything the driver needs is on stalks near the steering wheel, including lights (and the standard fog lamps), windshield wipers and washers, and cruise control. The cruise control operates flawlessly and holds speed precisely. There is a speedometer, tachometer, temperature and gas gauges and the full complement of warning lights including a front brake pad warning light (when the pads need replacing) and a washer fluid warning --after all, one can't have a luxury car without windshield washer fluid. 

Trunk space is excellent. A full-sized spare sits under the trunk and there is a tool-kit in a plastic case stowed in a compartment in the trunk. (It took me over a year to notice, but there is also a first aid kit stowed in the base of the driver's seat -- also in a nice plastic case.)

The car is at its best on the freeway -- and that is primarily what we bought ours (used) for. For long drives (5 hours and up), there is simply nothing like it. It is powerful at any speed and quickly moves around slower traffic -- especially nice on 2-lane roads. Obviously, it isn't a Vette or a Porsche, but it has all the power one could want. There is no difference in the feel of the car whether one is going 50 mph or, well, much more than 50 mph. At steady freeway speeds, the car gets remarkably good gas mileage -- between 21 and 23 mpg. And when you've got all that weight going that fast, it is very reassuring to know the car has "monster" brakes. Stopping is quick without any pull. And on long drives, the comfortable, supportive seats and interior quiet greatly reduces road fatigue -- you have to experience it to believe it.

In city driving, the car handles very well and its power and braking are again a boon. However, because of its luxury "soft" ride, it does tend to list a bit on hard corners. If one can take the potential seasickness, it holds corners very well. Expect 16-18 mpg in the city.

I highly recommend top-end touring tires (Michelin, Yokohama). It makes all the difference in the world. I also recommend finding a GOOD independent service man to save money -- but don't delude yourself, these cars use top of the line parts and one can expect to pay top of the line prices for them. But a good independent can save 1/3 on actual work and eliminate another 20% of unnecessary work that the Lexus dealer will push at you.

Our LS has 110,000 miles and the paint and interior look almost as good as new -- result of regular care and a little "Mequiars magic" on the paint.

The biggest problem one is apt to run into is finding an LS of this vintage that is in good shape. Relatively few people will sell one if it's running well. Thus, you have to find a good one by going through all the sellers who are selling because they're having problems (usually, by the way, a result of poor maintenance practices -- these cars when properly maintained just don't seem to have any problems). 

So, I recommend the car most highly, but you MUST get a pre-sale inspection from a reputable Lexus dealer (most of them are -- they're just expensive). They have a high incentive to find fault on the pre-sale: they know you'll likely complain successfully if they miss a serious problem and they would just as well discourage you so you buy one off their used Lexus lot. (A certified used Lexus is, by the way, an excellent buy but one does pay for it.) However, they only rarely sell used ones more than 5 years old. And I stress that while buying a used one is cheaper than the depreciation on a new one, this is a car for people who can accept a (very) occasional $1,000 (and more) repair bill without worrying about eating for the next month.
