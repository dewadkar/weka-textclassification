            I love the Miata.  No matter how many of my buddies tell me it is a "chick" car, I enjoy driving it.  I still see them wishing they had a convertible to drive around in the beautiful fall weather.  Although it is not made for everyone to drive, ie: anyone with a large build, or a height over 5' 10".  My wife and I bought a '91 for her to drive to college and absolutely loved it.  After it got totaled by an '88 Caddy using it to stop, we had to have another one.  So we are on our second Miata with plans to pass it on to our 2 year old when she gets old enough to drive.  Besides being tremendously reliable, it is extremely safe.  PLUS, she can only have one friend ride with her at a time.  The car is fun, comfortable, good on gas, cheap to operate, and fun!!!  I drove from Houston, TX, to Las Vegas, Nv in mine and was very pleased with how comfortable the leather seats are, and how much leg room I had.  Some people will complain about the wind noise with the top up ( I won't even mention with the top down because that is just silly ), but as convertibles go it is very quiet.  I know it is more quiet than a '95 Buick Skylark.

You will not be disappointed if you buy a new or used Miata, they are great cars.
