            I received this 1991 red Wrangler 4.0 liter, V6 with 60k mi from my parents when got my license in 1999, (with much pessimism from my mom because of Jeeps tendency to tip over)and I was in awe of it's "cuteness."  Of course, as a high school female I felt it was necessary to name my car so I dubbed her "Lola" for various reasons.  I drove everywhere at first and took several long road trips with my friends.  Initially, I had a bit of a problem on bumpy roads and experienced headaches for the first week or two (and some spilled coffee) but of course, this is to be expected on a jeep with raised suspensions and large tires.  I suppose also it's not good to jump speed bumps at 30 mph...Nonetheless, I trucked on despite the bad MPG and continued to enjoy my baby.
   After about a year I was rear-ended by a large Buick in the driver side corner (near the gas tank.)  Luckily, the gas tank suffered no harm but the damages cost $3,000 because the hit created a bump in the driver side panel.  It took a while to fix and repaint but Lola was better within a week.  
   The second accident ended in my rear-ending a new Mercury Cougar.  His car squashed like a tin can but my jeep only got a minor dent in the solid steel front bumper and a bent license plate.  Insurance suffered but I, my passengers and Lola all escaped with minor emotional damage. As with any car, make sure you check to make sure the tires are not getting too low on the treads.  I hydroplaned into the car on very slippery roads.
   Otherwise, I replaced the tape player with a new CD player and it increased the sound quality from the stock speakers greatly.  One thing that caused me THE MOST PROBLEM was the light in the speedometer went out after 3 years of driving and I thought replacement would be easy.  Not so.  My mechanically inclined father and I took apart the dash trying to find out how to fix it and eventually resorted to sending it to the shop.  $90 later it was fixed--not that big an expense for an important part.  
   The V6 standard transmission was excellent for stop lights and passing.  I raced several random cars at stop lights (not organized, just for fun) and beat them all for the most part.  Of course, most other cars have better speed ability once the initial pick up is surpassed.  I was pleased nonetheless.  Lola kicked some butts.
   After putting 45,000 miles on Lola in the 3 years I drove the Jeep it was time to get a new car.  Sadly, the Jeep had not let me down much and was a pleasure to drive in the winter, summer, spring and fall.  The "Jeep Wave" is very comforting and my jealous friends wished they drove Jeeps too.  
   I would highly recommend this to any teenager who is about to take their drivers test because visibility for parallel parking and lane changes is EXCELLENT.  Off-roading is a breeze and I surpassed many boys with higher powered trucks.  Yes, girls can go mud bogging too.  The bumpy ride is not pleasant for some but overall, I loved my car and if I could afford it I would buy a new one.  Enjoy your "babys" too and try to avoid Mercury Cougars in rainstorms!
