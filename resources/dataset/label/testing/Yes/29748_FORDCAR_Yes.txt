            I mostly bought the Ford Explorer because I wanted revenge against the anti-SUV weenies.  I looked at all of the other brands:  Isuzu, Chevy, Mazda, Toyota, Dodge, etc.  I found them to be greatly lacking in earnest comforts.  I didn't want a vehicle in which to go climb rocks and mountains.  I wanted something to scare the weenies in their little VW's.  I liked the compromise of solidity and comfort afforded (easily, I might add) of the Explorer.  The most comfortable seats on the marked reside in this brave little vehicle.  The price was also right.  Compared to the massively marked up prices of the Japanese offerings and the &quot;we'll just need to add a little to the price for tires&quot; offerings of both Chevy and Dodge the Ford was remarkably affordable.  The only problem with driving the thing is that I can't find it in the mall parking lot without pressing the ever-popular panic button on my keychain.  The Explorer has become so ubiquitous that suburbanites should perhaps start attaching flags to theirs so they can find them.<br><br>
