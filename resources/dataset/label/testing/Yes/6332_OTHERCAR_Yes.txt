            At first my husband and I were at odds about buying a van.  Since we had never owned one we weren't sure this is what we would really like so, we decided to do some test driving.

Glory, I can't even remember everyone that we drove but I know that most of the minivans that our on the market today we test drove them.  I mean it was forget making the quick purchase, first we had to decide what make we wanted and felt more comfortable with, and then if we liked what the dealers and the car had to offer us.

After testing minivans for 3 straight days we finally made our chose, we feel in love with the toyota sienna, and decided to purchase the sunfire red LE Edition in December of 1997 and of course this was the 1998 model.

After driving,and see what the other dealers had to offer nothing felt as nice a ride our as quiet as what the sienna did.  They also have dual air controls in the back so that the back passengers could feel comfortable too, and then there is cup holders all over the place to put your drinks in so nothing gets spilled.  As of yet we still haven't taken any vacation in it but we are looking forward to it because we just love this van.

Sure we could have got a cheaper one that even came with more accessories and more colors but when we started looking at the things that really mattered to us you could really see that the Sienna was in a big class all of it's own.  Even the way the sliding doors roll, you can see and tell a difference in how that feels.  

As of to date my family owns a sienna and a camry and my daughter will be purchasing a vechicle sometime this fall and she wants the Rav4.  I guess you could say that most of us our really sold on the Toyota line and the service area that we go to couldn't treat you any better.

So if you are out there looking for a new car, truck, or a minivan, give the Toyota a try, especially the V6 engine I don't think that you will be disappointed.  The only con thought is they do seem to get stolen the most, lol, guess the thieves love the car too.<br><br>
