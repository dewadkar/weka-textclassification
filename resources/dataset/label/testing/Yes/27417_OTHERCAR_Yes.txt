            We bought our Neon because we liked the looks, the price and the way it drives.  Our '95 cost around $5,800.00.  It's a compact car, but spacious inside.  My husband and I are large people and this car fits us comfortable.  I love the way it drives--it handles very nicely and it's easy to see out of.  I love the stock stereo and the speakers built into the doors.  I love the de-ice back window.  The heater/air conditioning controls are great--if it get's too hot or too cold, you can turn the temperature down or up!  My kids love it too and find it's very comfortable.  It's fun to drive and comfortable for long trips.  The seats tilt all the way down if you want to take a nap during a road trip. The trunk is large enough to fit in all the groceries and more from a large shopping trip--I shop for a family of four.   <br><br>
