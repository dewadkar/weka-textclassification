            I bought this car off of a woman over 2 years ago. I drove it around for a year and then sold the SHO to someone for nearly the same price. But when I bought it, it gave me a feeling of driving in an "American Lexus". It was a very attracitve car, although the woman I bought it off of ran in through a million car washes which dulled the finish with swirl marks. It had a few visual blemishes here and there, but the interior was in near perfect condition. It had leather, CD, cruise control, power seats, fog lights, and one hell of an engine. 

ROAD TEST:
            This car came with a Yamaha built 3.0 liter V6 engine which produced 220 horses. This car rules on the highway and it negotiated turns and passing effortlessly. It also was a pleasure to drive in the city. These days, having 220 horses underneath your right foot is a luxury indeed, and It kept road ragers in my rear view mirror. The only thing wrong with the performance of this car was the Transmission. It seemed to be indecisive and juggle between the gears often. If Ford put a better Transmission in with better shifting, it could easy make it a bit quicker. But this car as is.....rocketed off the line.

However, I've done my homework about this car and asked around. I've heard horror stories from SHO owners and from websites as well. Things from Trannie failure, axle breakage, and even short engine life. This motivated me to sell the car for $6,000 even though I never had any problems with this car, just routine maintenance and a recharge of the AC. It was a heck of a ride, and it is worth looking into if you are in search of some cheap speed.
