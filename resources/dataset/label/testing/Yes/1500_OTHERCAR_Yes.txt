            Aaahh, my Saturn SL1, brings back memories of long drives from the Jersey Shore to Virginia Beach without having to fill up more than once.  Comfortable and roomy.  Rear split seats.  Service was always scheduled maintenance , not emergency surgery.  My Saturn was awesome.  It could do no wrong in my eyes.  It was affordable.  It drove beautifully.  Plus the quality of care you received when you brought your baby in for a tune up was beyond compare.  You scheduled a time, and was finished before you had to start digging at the bottom of your purse to find some change for the candy machine, because now you had no time for lunch.

The only thing my Saturn couldn't do was part the sea.  And that's when this love story ended.  We decided to run down to the beach during a nor'easter.  Up one side of a bridge and down the other.  We did not expect the river to be in the street.  She tried and tried with all her might but she just couldn't make it through.  She stalled in about two feet of water.  She restarted and got us through the flood, but died when we were to safety.  She was towed away, never to be driven by us again.  The insurance company totaled her because salt water got into the engine, and she was gone forever.  

Or so I thought.  A few months later a stranger called.  He was a friend of the insurance guy and bought the car for his daughter.  It is still being driven today.  Just maybe, it could part the sea.

If you are looking for a reliable car, a Saturn is for you!!
