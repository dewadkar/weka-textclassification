            I purchased my 1998 - 2 door - RAV4 in December 1999 as a used vehicle with only 13,000 miles on it.  I've put 10,000 more miles on it and have never been happier.  It gets good gas mileage (over 20 mpg), handles well on the highway (in good and bad weather), is easy to park (short wheelbase).  My RAV4 has a manual 5 speed transmission and I find that it shifts very easily and is great on hills (no problem rolling back).  

The rear seats fold down (independently) very easily and make the back area great for larger boxes and toting bulky items.  Back 'door' - not just a hatch - is wonderful for full access.  I'm relatively short and it's very easy to get in and out of the vehicle without feeling like a step stool is needed.  

I will admit that the 2 door model is very slim on rear leg room, but I didn't buy it to carry lots of passengers - mainly myself and maybe one passenger...  

My vehicle came with a full audio package - AM/FM, cassette and CD player and its very convenient and fun to use.

Great heating/air conditioning system - quick to respond and adjust.  All together a WIN-WIN situation.<br><br>
