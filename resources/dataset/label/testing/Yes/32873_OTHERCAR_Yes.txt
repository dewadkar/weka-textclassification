            Digital cameras are now very easy to find and their prices range from cheap to expensive.  If you don't know what you are really interested in when you begin your search for a camera, you are likely to choose whichever one sounds the best at the time and has a relatively low price (around $180).

Things you must consider before making the purchase are:
* What kind of pictures do I want to take - snapshots with little picture composition, or setup shots (generally requiring manual adjustments to shutter speed, focus, and aperture)
* Do you want to be able to make large, quality prints from your pictures (over 5 x 7)?  This requires that you purchase a camera with a high resolution (4.0 or higher megapixel).
* Do you want to be able to use a flash?  If so, make sure that the camera you're looking for has one or is capable of having one connected to it.
* Do you want to be able to transfer your images directly from your camera to your computer?  If so, make sure that it has either a firewire or USB connection.  
* Do you want to be able to zoom in one something from a fair distance without losing picture quality?  If so, you need to pay attention to the optical, not the digital resolution.  Good cameras have optical resolution of 10x or greater.

The things that I wanted in a digital camera were:
* Manual or automatic modes (for either snapshots or set up shots)
* High resolution so pictures could be blown up and not lose clarity
* High optical zoom, so I could zoom in without losing clarity
* Flash

This camera has all of the characteristics I was looking for and more.  It has a 12x optical zoom, 4.0 megapixel resolution, lens that can be changed to get an even higher optical zoom, flash that can be changed to get a larger area lit up, manual and automatic modes, large 2 inch viewfinder, USB connection, and an image stabilizer.  Additional features that were just a bonus for me were that it records motion and sound (short video clips, this is not a camcorder), SD memory cards (faster, larger memory than traditional memory cards), and many advanced functions for taking more exciting pictures.

We have used this camera for about a week (they just arrived in stores in mid-December 2003).  We have really enjoyed the ease of use, the picture quality, the wonderful zoom, and the speed of transfer of pictures from the camera to the computer.  It is a fairly large camera since it has such a large zoom.  This one will not fit in a small purse or pocket.  It is not very heavy though, which is nice.

After using the camera, there are a couple of things that Panasonic could have done to improve it, but not as much for picture quality as for ease for photographer.  For example, if they had provided a Firewire connection, the already fast picture transfer from camera to computer would be even faster (which might come in handy with a large memory card holding over a hundred pictures).  Another thing is that the lens cap completely detaches from the camera.  This means that if you are walking around taking pictures, you've got to make sure you hang on to the lens cap.  It would be nice if it had a cord that was connected to the camera so that even if it were off the lens, you wouldn't have to worry about losing it.  In the week that we've been using it, we've left the lens laying somewhere twice and had to go back later to find it.  We're going to attempt to put some velcro on the back of it and the camera so that we can attach it to the camera after we've taken it off.  And the last minor complaint is that the viewfinder is exposed at all times and is not adjustable.  There is at least one other digital camera (though it didn't have the same resolution or optical zoom) that has a viewfinder that swivels out, tilts, and folds back against the camera.  This would be a nice feature since it would protect the screen and allow you to view your shot from multiple angles.

Despite my minor complaints, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone wishing to take more than just party snapshots and who wants high quality prints.  It comes at a high price, but you are not likely to need anything else in the near future.  Unless you are a professional, this is really the best camera that I could find.
