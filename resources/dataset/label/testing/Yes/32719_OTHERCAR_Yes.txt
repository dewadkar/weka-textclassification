            Well after taking ton of pictures with a regular camera that uses film, and getting them developed I was tired and mad with all the money wasted on film.  so I decided to finally purchase this digital camera.

I love this camera because you can take a pictures on it and see it right away.. If it did not come out the way you want it, all you have to do is delete it and take another.It uses 3.5&quot; floppy disc and can hold about 35 to 40 pictures on it.

It has all the options of a regular camera too, you can easily zoom in and out with one touch of a button. 

There are many different settings from inside to outdoor lighting to nighttime. Once you have filed up the floppy you can load it onto your pc and reuse the floppy again and again. This really comes in handy when you are trying not to waste film at parties or big family gatherings.
This is a great way for sending pictures to friends far away who have computers which is virtually anyone.
