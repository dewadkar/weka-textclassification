            I bought this car for 18k in august 2000. I bought it because it was large,roomy,comfortable,and powerful.I love the comfortable seats and quiet ride and the A/C is very cold and cools fast in hot weather.I don't really hate anything about this car but the hood could use a light under it.This car also drives very well, The ride is very good and is improved with the Driver Select System which lets you select three steering and suspension settings.There is more than enough power to merge on the freeway and has very good passing power.The brakes are very good due in part to the standard four wheel-disc and ABS. I recommend this car to people who want a large family front wheel drive car that is luxorious and powerful. This Car also costs around $40,000 brand new.<br><br>
