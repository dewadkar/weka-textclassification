            Having owned most of the competition, Chevy Blazer, GMC Jimmy, Olds Bravada etc. I found the Ford Explorer to be the most dependable.  Mileage
was equal to or better than the rest of the same size S.U.V.'s  Definitely
purchase the four wheel drive model.  While going in you will pay more
but the 4x4 will hold its value when it is time to trade-in or resell.
Additionally, once you own a four wheel drive vehicle you will find the
new desire to &quot;explore&quot;.  Interior space, Olds Bravada and Ford Explorer
have the most.  Chevy and GMC have the least.  Durability, Ford definitely
outlasted the others.  Olds came in a near second.
Really a versatile mode of transport, ideal for city, country-single or
family.  <br><br>
