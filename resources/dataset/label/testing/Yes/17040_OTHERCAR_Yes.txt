            When looking for a vehicle, I was pretty set on a truck.  I was interested in the Dodge Ram and Chevrolet Full-size.  However, I was talked into driving the Durango at the Dodge dealership.  I was sold instantly.  

I drove the Ram after the Durango, and there was no comparison in the driving.  The Durango drives much better and handles better.  There is TONS of interior room, which makes it great for keeping cargo out of the open. I have NO problems towing anything I want.  It pulls trailers like they aren't there.  

Gas mileage is a problem, but it is with any SUV.  The V8, 360 (which I have)seems to get better mileage than the 318.  Heavier than the Grand Cherokee, it handles better and has much better traction.  Acceleration is great with the 360.  I've had a few electronic quirks, such as the power window motors going out and the cruise light going out, but nothing major.

Besides a minor recall, it has only been to the shop once, for the window repair.  I'm a firefighter, so I have all sorts of electronic equipment hooked up and I drive the heck out it -- even so, I have no problems with the transmission or battery/alternator.  Cooling system works very well too.  I do a lot of highway driving, and a good bit of off road as well, and the Durango handles both great.  

Very comfortable for the long road trips. You can't get as many luxury extras for the interior, but if you're looking for a real working SUV that looks great, the Durango is perfect.  

VERY safe, VERY reliable, VERY happy owner!<br><br>
