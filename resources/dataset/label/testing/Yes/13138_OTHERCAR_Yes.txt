             I&#146ve  come to enjoy photography as a relaxing and enjoyable hobby that takes me far away from the stresses of work.   I&#146m also a person who demands quality and value for the hard earned money I&#146ve been blessed to spend.  I&#146m also not a real technical guy,  so I&#146ll leave the technical stuff to others who are better suited here at Epinions.  But let me give you my &#147 top line &#147 assessment of the C5050Z.  First, however, a little background.

When it comes to cameras Olympus has been my choice hands down.  From my first Olympus SLR to the C3000Z ,C4040Z, and now the C5050Z, quality, price, and value have always been met.  

  I first became interested in the C5050  after my best friend returned from a fraternity reunion with photos that were absolutely stunning. I inquired as to what camera was used for these shots and lo and behold it was the C5050. I had been doing some casual reading on the camera and thinking about upgrading.  What I saw made me more serious.  Like many of you, I did tons of research on the C5050 and read more than my share of reviews. The more I read ,the more I was impressed.  It became increasingly  clear that it was time to upgrade to a five megapixel camera.  But which one, the C5050 or the C50 ?  I  researched so much that I think I began to suffer from the proverbial &#147 paralysis of analysis,&#148 and decided to  contact someone with the expertise to give me solid advice.  That someone was Howard Creech, one of the premier reviewers here on Epinions.  To make a long story short, Mr. Creech&#146s assessment was that the C5050 was a &#147 much more capable camera than the C50.&#148  Howard&#146s advice was what pushed me to purchase.  Here are my findings :

Quality of Construction

1. A professional camera look and feel in your 
   hands. Nothing cheesy about this bad boy.  
2. The magnesium body is solid, and Olympus, to their 
   credit and ingenuity, has basically used the same body 
   mold as seen in both the C3000 and 4000 series. A nice 
   way to keep production costs down with a winning body
   style.
3. The C5050 is NOT a &#147 shirt pocket &#147 camera !  So if
   small is your preference, look at the C50 or a 
   competitive unit.
4. Control buttons well placed on the camera, easy access
   with controls that are easy to learn & quickly utilize.

The C5050 Learning Curve

For a digicam novice, learning to use this unit might be a little tedious.  However, previous experience with the C3000 and the C4040 was a great &#147 training ground &#147  for me along with thorough reviews of the camera via Steve&#146s Digicams.  Upon receipt of the camera I was ready to &#147 rock and roll &#147 in a matter of moments.  If you are new to the C5050 or to digital cameras in general, I&#146d advise you to take the time to learn the system, experiment, and learn from the mistakes.  It&#146s time well invested, because once you&#146ve got the system down, the fun really begins !  The manual provided provides basic information ( it&#146s almost an insult ) so consult the enclosed CD, experiment, learn, and then experiment some more.  You&#146ll be surprised at what you&#146ll learn and what you&#146ll be able to accomplish with his camera in a short period of time by giving it the due diligence it richly deserves.  

Image Quality

1.In a word, OUTSTANDING !  Vivid color reproduction and 
  clarity.  It&#146s definitely what you want from a five 
  megapixel camera.  I took a shot of a multi-colored 
  blanket mi wife had hanging outside to dry.  I used 
  Program Mode in sunny  conditions and the print just
  absolutely knocked me out of my seat.  The gold, red,
  green, and black colors seemed to want to &#147 jump &#147 out of
  the print and no over saturation or bleeding were seen.
  The clarity was such that you can see the threading of 
  the material.  Other test shots, of vegetation, 
  buildings, autos, etc., produced the same results, 
  outstanding color reproduction and clarity.  I also took 
  pictures at a school graduation ceremony, and the output
  was so good that some of the parents asked and paid for 
  copies&#133.now it doesn&#146t get better than that !

Image Editing

2. A great camera like the C5050 DESERVES a good photo
   printer.  I prefer Epson and own an 825 and a 1280. You 
   may have a different preference, but Epson has always
   given me what I needed, excellent reproductions at
   affordable prices, sizing options, and value.  
3. I&#146d also invest in a good photo imaging program such
   Photoshop Elements or one of the others available,
   depending upon your resources.  The provided Camedia 
   software&#133.well&#133..it&#146s software&#133.lol,lol.

Camera Features

As some have insinuated, this camera is almost &#147 over featured.&#148  There are a variety of shooting modes :

1. Program Mode &#150 Let&#146s the camera do all the work, just 
   point and shoot
2. Aperture Mode - You control the aperture settings
3. Shutter Mode - You control the shutter speeds
4. Manual Mode &#150 You control the aperture and shutter speed
   settings
5. Movie Mode w/sound & add sound to your snapshots as 
   well !
6. Auto Landscape & Auto Landscape w/portrait
7. Sports Scene Mode & Night Scene Mode
8. Portrait Mode
9. My Mode &#150 Where you can save your favorite settings !
10.There is also a 2:1 mode where you can have two photos 
   intertwined into one shot.
11.Multiple white balance options & record modes
12.You can change the flash intensity, contrast, and 
   sharpness with the touch of a button or two.
13.Batteries : Olympus provides a charger & 4 rechargeable 
   batteries.  The camera will also use alkalines and the
   CRV3 lithiums.
14.The viewfinder will rotate to 90 degrees...how many 
   cameras have that feature ?

Card Options

1.Now here is where Olympus has hit a &#147 grand slam &#147 in my
  opinion.  
2.Unlike previous C series models which have only used   
  Smartmedia cards, the C5050 has two internal slots for 
  four different formats: Smartmedia, xD cards ( Olympus 
  provides a 32MB xD ard with the camera ), CompactFlash
  Type I/II, and the IBM Microdrive.  You can have, for 
  example, a xD card in one slot and a CompactFlash card in
  the other at the same time.  Changing formats is as easy 
  a touching a button, and keep shooting.  Five gold stars 
  to the engineer who designed this ! 

Recommendations

1. As others have stated, purchase extra batteries.
2. Invest in a high MB xD Card, CompactFlash, or Smartmedia 
   card.  Buy as many megabytes as you can afford.
3. Invest in the CLA-1 lens adaptor & step up ring and 
   purchase a circular polarizing filter.  The effects of 
   the polarizing filter you&#146ll have to see for yourself 
   AND you now have the option to add additional filters to
   the camera that will take your photographic experience
   to an entirely new level.

How does one sum up this wonderful camera ?  I guess the best way is by saying this camera has achieved 2003 World Class Status in digital imaging by PC World.  That&#146s pretty high praise considering the competition offered by Canon, Nikon, and other manufacturers of fine digital cameras.  Here are a few quick comments from PC World:

1. Top-drawer image quality
2. Better-than-average battery life
3. Plenty of high-end features 
4. An easy-to-use interface make Olympus's C-5050 Zoom a
   digital camera that's ready for serious shooters. 
5. The $799, 5-megapixel C-5050 earned some of the best 
   image-quality scores we've seen on our tests, 
   particularly for outdoor photos. 
6. And it lets you take plenty of them--its batteries lasted
   for over 370 shots.

So ladies and gentlemen, you can&#146t go wrong with the C5050.  The $ 799.00 price quoted above is MSRP.  Shop around, you can get it for much cheaper.  Go to your favorite camera shop, hold the C5050.  Play with it if you will, have a few test shots taken and printed out for you.  Once you do, you&#146ll see why this camera earns all of it&#146s rave reviews. I'm more than glad I made the purchase...you will be too !@

P.S. &#150 Howard Creech&#133.You are the man & Thanks Again !
