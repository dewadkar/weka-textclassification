            I purchased my 1988 Explorer custom van (G-20) in 1988 and it has been a daily driver for 13 years. It currently has 191,000 miles on the original engine. No problems. I replaced the transmission at 165K, but as with most vehicles, that can be expected. I have had no major problems with the Van and it left me stranded only once, and that was caused by the Alarm system...what can I say. The van was used for many years on cross country trips averaging 18 MPG on the road. Not bad for a 3/4 ton high top van. I get around 15.5 MPG in town. Still, not bad for it's size. Mechanically, I have replaced two or three alternators over the last 13 years. The brakes are great! The lining lasts between 35-40 thousand miles on the front and between 60-70 thousand miles on the rear. On the down-side, the A/C has been a disappointment. I have had to have it repaired 3 or 4 times and it simply can't keep the vehicle cool on 95 degree days in Houston. Don't even consider purchasing one without rear A/C. Mine has it, and does fairly well until late July comes around. My only other complaint is side winds...be careful and have both hands on the wheel when you are in a high-top G20. You will get tossed around.

The Van has been wonderful in term of it's reliability and longevity. I paid $30K for it in 1988 and based on it's years of service, I feel I got a great deal! You can probably purchase one for between $2500-$5000 based on condition..go for it!
