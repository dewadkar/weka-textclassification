            Ack!A product review by oldcomixfan?Have I gone insane?Why,yes,yes I have.Thanks for asking.Let us begin,please.

I remember ,years ago,before purchasing this vehicle, and having to drive around in my desert-storm colored,yet,totally voluptuous `77 Pontiac Ventura,how I used to admire all the reverse- teardrop-shaped cars whizzing around me.

"I want one of those,"I pondered,"I want a fata$$ed car and to be hip with the times."
 
A few months of hauling soylent brown in a grainbuggy and I was rich and ready to shop for a coveted fata$$ed car.
The car I was so cravenly desiring was found in a nearby town not far from Harelip.The front yard of a guy who bought used/wrecked/confiscated/auctioned -by -the-cops-dirt-cheap cars,to be exact.

For $3,800 I got a 1995 Neon that had been wrecked during a chase by some local kids, with a trunk full of meth,running from the cops.The guy I bought it from fixed it up so you would never know the front wheels had been snapped off the axles or that the front end had been caved in.He did a good job on the paint, also.Mileage equaled 67,000.Bank account:zero.{I bury my money}

I'm over 6 feet tall,so,this car does ok for headroom.The seat,however,does not go back far enough to accomodate my storkish legs.As a result,I get uncomfortable and crampy after 2 hours in this thing.Fortunately for me,though,my workplace, and the nearest wet county, are less than 20 minutes away.
This car has windshield wipers,a cigar lighter,a factory radio,power door locks,rear window defroster,windshields,a steering wheel,an automatic gearshift,handles for cranking the windows,speedometer,tachometer,automatic transmission/front-wheel drive,,wheels,a 4-cylinder 2 liter single overhead cam 132 HP engine that gets 29 MPG,fuel injection,computer-controlled ignition,a trunk,headlights{both bright and dim},tail lights,brake lights,turn signals,bumpers,shock absorbers{stiff and rough riding},seats{buckets in front,plus a back seat},glove box,vanity mirrors{lighted}installed in the visors,gas tank{about 11 gallon capacity},center console storage compartment{you put your weed in it},rear view mirror{left and right remotely adjustable},gas and brake peadal{plus emergency brake lever},ashtray{lighted},dome light{lighted},no moon roof{optional},AC/heater{works great},power steering,catalytic converter plus exhaust system,fuel gauge{accurate},check engine plus alternator disfunction warning lights in the dash,cooling system{no problems so far},EGR apparatuses,upstream and downstream oxygen sensors,numerous engine parameter monitoring transducers{bulletproof according to the guy at the parts store},and a 12 volt battery{don't get the ones at Wal-Mart},plus numerous MacGyverish innovations I cannot tell ,otherwise I would have to kill you.

The first thing I did, after purchasing this inert- gas -pretending vehicle, was to order a Chilton's manual,so I could do things myself.Which I do.Here is my performance history of this car ,so far{I am a stickler for maintenance;some have even dared called me anal:their bodies fit nicely inside the surprisingly roomy trunk}:

79,800 miles:Spark plugs.Change every 30,000 miles.

83,150 miles:Air filter.Change every 15,000 miles.
             Oil &filter.Change every 7,000 miles.
             Transmission fluid and filter.Every 15,000 miles.

84,168 miles:Lubed ball joints.Every 7,000 miles.

95,634 miles:Changed upstream oxy sensor{still get occasional check engine light and fault code 21;downstream oxy sensor,ignore}

96,460 miles:Changed PCV valve.Change every 50,000 miles.

96,780:Changed radiator coolant.Every 33,000 miles.

97,111:Changed powertrain control module aka the computer.Price:about 400 bucks U.S.{got mine for free from the guy who sold the car to me,one of the perks.}

97,200:Changed fuel pump.The old one would quit working after driving for an hour on days above 70 degree F.Cost for new:about 300 bucks U.S.{I also got one of those for free from the car guy,plus anything else I wanted.More perks.}

105,000 miles:Had timing belt changed by idiot mechanic at the dealership near Harelip, who left a motor mount bolt sticking out.Cost:$700 for that, plus install new shocks on rear.I raised cain.

109,710:Had to replace halfshafts and tie rod ends due to a strange shimmy that occurred when I gassed the car at 45 MPH.Estimated cost of replacement:About $500.Free for me.More perks.No Body Perks,though.@#$%^%$

Current mileage is 133,000, which means I must change the tranny fluid again.Since replacing the halfshafts I have not had any problems to date ,except for blown fuses caused by the railguns I installed in the fender wells.OOPS,I didn't type that.

This car rides pretty rough due to the rather stiff suspension intended for better steering,cornering ,and handling-good handling that prevented me from getting smacked head-on by a Tyson driver hauling live chickens to the local chicken-slaughtering facility.

Do not fall for the propaganda that states you will get up to 39 MPG in this car.That would only happen if you drove from the Rockies to the Missisippi River with a good stiff tail wind.Expect an overall average of roughly 30 MPG under general driving conditions.This car leaves something to be desired as far as acceleration goes.Get a Viper instead.

The one thing about this car,or any car in my book,is that it starts and gets me to work on time.I still think it looks too much like Herbie the Love Bug when viewed front-on.The again,maybe that's what makes this ride one irresistably sexy beast.YEAH BABY!=insert stupid laugh=
