            Well, I guess this gives new meaning to built Ford tough.  I have a 1994 Ranger with everything, my favorite feature...4X4.  This truck is great, it has a little over 100,000 miles.  I have had a new transmission put in, but with that many miles it is expected.  

I love that I can get a tough truck in compact size.  In comparing it to Chevy--it offers a lot more.  To get the same amount of options on a Chevy as the Ford Ranger offers you have to purchase a ZR2, which is quite a bit more pricy!!  Around $23,000, whereas you can purchase a ranger for around $19,500.  Not to metion the 4.0 v6 that comes with the ranger.  

Living on a farm, the truck is like a farmhand.  You rely on it day and night.  Granted you can't pull a stock trailer like you can with a full size truck (although I have seen it done, it is not safe).  But I haul a ton of feed in the bed at least once a month.  I also have a camper we pull with it.  This truck is full power!!  It handles like most sports cars, its fast...but also light in the rear like most sports cars which means you will fishtail at high speeds with generally wet roads.  

If you need a tough, economical truck that is going to pay for itself over and over...the Ranger is for you.  The gas milage is good,and the durablity is great.  It is sporty and has plenty of power.  And can handle most jobs!!
