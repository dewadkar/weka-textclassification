            I love this car.  But I might be a little biased.  My mother has owned two of these.  The first was a relatively laid back maroon LX without all the fancy options.  But it had a wonderful ride and lots of power.  After a starter problem (the car took about 10 secs to start if it had been sitting more than 30 minutes and less than 2 hours) she traded it in for another one.  This one was black with grey vented leather power seats, dual tone wheels, tinted windows, and incredible stereo and a CD player.  This car is awesome.  It is a blast to drive, it has great power from a dead stop all the way up to freeway speeds.  It handles beautifully, which has saved me from more than one accident.  The only major drawback to this car is the 70,000 mile maintenance.  This ended up costing a total of about $3,000.  Unfortunately Chrysler automatic transmissions are very sensitive to the type of fluid used in them.  Usage of Dexron, (the so-called universal transmission fluid) which is what almost all mechanics (including Chrysler dealers!) use, will do major damage to them.  So if you are buying a used one with around 70,000 miles on it, beware.  If you own one make sure that you have 7176+ fluid in your transmission.  Buy some from a local auto store, take it a mechanic, and WATCH them put it in.  Sometimes they will use Dexron no matter what you say.  Note that this only applies to Chrysler Corp. 4-speed automatics.  Check your manual for fluid types.

Engine:

Mitsubishi manufactured 2.5L V-6 with 164hp or 168hp depending on the year.  This is an excellent engine with good amounts of power and smooth operation.  The engine rarely makes a lot of noise, even when pushed to the electronically controlled max shift engine speed of 6500rpm but the noise it does make is quite pleasant.  Fuel economy (23/30 EPA) is impressive for a 3000+ lb car with a V-6 and automatic.  Although mileage will vary with model year and option packages as well as proper engine maintenance.  The only time our Cirrus ever failed to start it was simply flooded and started about an hour later.  Cold weather seems to have no effect what so ever on driving or starting.

Handling:

Handling will vary with option packages and tires.  With the sports package it is excellent, much better than one would expect from a luxury car.  The bottom does scrape from time to time on steep driveways and business entrances.  Without the sports package handling is predictable, if not exceptional.  Breaks are excellent as is the ABS system.

Ride:

Even with the sports package the ride is enjoyable.  6 hour trips are a breeze.  You can feel the road, but bumps are soft and quiet.  Without the stiffer suspension the ride is incredibly smooth.

Interior:

The seats are very comfortable, even in the back (although 6+ footers might appreciate limited back seat leg room).  Controls are easy to use although the right side of the steering wheel windshield wiper controls are a bit different.  Sound systems are great, if the CD player skips you probably just did a fair amount of damage to the car.  Visibility (without tinted windows) is ok, but it is hard to judge distances to the rear, everything looks a lot closer than it is because of the shape of the trunk.  The trunk is very spacious but hard to access because of a relatively small trunk opening.

Exterior:

Some like the styling, some don't.  It can look sporty or luxurious (or both) depending on color, trim, and wheels.  Looks great with a roof-rack and two kayaks on top of it!  The aerodynamic styling is accurate, with a very sporty .31 drag coefficient.  There is very little wind noise on the highway.<br><br>
