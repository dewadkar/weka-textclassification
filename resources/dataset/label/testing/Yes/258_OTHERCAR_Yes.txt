            I did the research and found the G1 to be feature rich AND from a maker of good cameras.  The warning here is to avoid cameras from companies that know more about electronics then lenses. The two biggest pluses are the camcorder style battery which lasts a long time as well as the CF Type 2 memory card.  While I did not buy the 300MB microdrive at this time, the thought that I can in the future is a good feeling. 

The biggest drawback is the fact that indoor pictures with the built in flash do not rival 35mm 400 speed film even to my amateur eyes. I have been told by better authority that most digital cameras suffer from this problem and that the solution is an external flash.  Fortunately, this is one of the few cameras that allow hookup with an external flash; one of the features of a "prosumer" model. The rubber flap covering the plugs on the side is feeble at best and I am counting the days before I have to buy a new one.  The camera's main functions are controlled by a small rotary dial (underneath another rotary dial) and it is hard to access.  My final issue is that the camera is very square, I have big hands, and I have to be very aware of where I place my fingers as to not block anything vital.  I think this is one area where it's main competitor (the Nikon Coolpix) has the advantage.
