             PERSONAL EXPERIENCE-

I have never owned a brand new car. Neither has my husband. We always had used cars, because a young couple just can't afford one of those expensive new luxury cars. You'll really laugh at this ok. My husband was driving by a Toyota dealership one day on his way home from work and saw a 2000 Dodge Durango sitting in the lot. Just for curiosities sake he stopped to peek inside it hoping it didn't belong to someone who would get rather mad having some stranger peeking in his car. 

LUCK-

One of the sales people saw him, walked over and started talking to him. The Durango had been leased out for six months then left there at the Toyota place. The man was real nice about everything and helped us work out a payment plan we could afford... barely...but what do you expect with a young couple with a child. So we bought it. 

ONE PROBLEM AND SOLUTION-

I'll be honest the Durango does suck up some gas, but there is a trick to that. If you keep it about half full it doesn't seem to be quiet so bad. 

MEN'S POINT OF VIEW AND MECHANIC'S-

My husband loves all the power in it and the major point of it being a Dodge. If you have ever worked on a car you know how hard it can be to work on some, but not a Dodge. From a mechanics point of view a Dodge is the best and easiest auto to work on. We haven't had any problems with it yet and we have had it over a year. 

WOMAN'S POINT OF VIEW AND THAT OF THE CHILD'S-

It is also the perfect car for a woman. It has all the leg room you could ever wish for to stretch those achy mommy muscles and plenty of space in the back for the kids and all their toys. My son loves this. He is always running around the house yelling, "Want to go bye, bye truck." He is happy just to be able to sit in it and play. The third seat is a bit of a squeeze, but I always leave it down and have plenty of room to stuff things in the back. 

ALARM-

One bad thing though most come with an alarm. How can that be bad? That's what you are wondering,right? I always seem to set of that alarm. It's just me though it never seems to do it with any one else. 

LO JACK-

This is something I for got to add in this review. I thought I had better go back and update it. Lo Jack is a new invention that I personally think is great. What Lo Jack is , is a computer chip tracking device. If someone does manage to get by the alarm and steal your car this will help immensely. You report the car stolen, the car company turns on the Lo Jack, and then they can lead the police right to your car. Pretty neat isn't it. Plus having Lo Jack equipped on your car makes your car insurance cheaper.

EXTRA FEATURES-

Of course the Durango comes equipped with some of the usual stuff- like anti-lock breaks, power steering,power windows. It also comes with dual air bags- the passenger one can be turned off, front and rear wind shied wipers. But there is also something I haven't seen before. Instead of just having settings for the ventilation system in the front there is also adjustments in the back for the rear of the car. So if you are hot and the kids are cold you can adjust the settings to make everyone happy.
