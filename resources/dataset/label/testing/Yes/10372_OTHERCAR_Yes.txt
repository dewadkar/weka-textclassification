            I have owned about every genre of car out there.  I have had a Honda Accord Hatchback, Honda Sedan, Volkswagen Bug, Nissan Pick Up and Ford Bronco.  We were looking for a second car and I wanted something fun and inexpensive to zip around town in... and I got it!

At the time of purchase Kia was having a big rebate which was a nice bonus at the time.  I test drove a couple of models on the lot before I settled for a nice shiny black Sephia.  I came complete with Air conditioning and CD player and all for about $5000 less than I would have paid for a comparable model.

Many people scoffed at my KIA when I pulled up for the first time but they don't know what they are missing!  The gas mileage alone makes everyone jealous.  I fill up that whopping 12 gallon tank every 10 days or so.  I also love the fact that I can do a complete turn around in the middle of an intersection and can park basically anywhere a bike can park. The trunk has a large capacity for groceries, etc. and the rear seat is a 60/40 split and folds down to expand the space of the trunk.

My Kia is not fancy.. it lacks the bells and whistles such as a plush interior and a &quot;Cadillac-like&quot; ride, but it's all the car and then some for me.  It has massive leg room in both the front and rear seats.  I highly recommend a Kia for anyone who wants a great value and a fun ride!<br><br>
