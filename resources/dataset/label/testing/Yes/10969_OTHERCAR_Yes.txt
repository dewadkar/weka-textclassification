            On the whole we love our 1998 Chevy Suburban.  It's big, it can carry anything, and it gives a smooth ride. It had these wonderful little pockets and compartments and places to put everything you could ever want to carry in your car. It has a glove compartment like most cars...then it has the center console which is just enormous and has places to hold CD's, a change organizer and two cup-holders. Over head, there are several pockets...for maps, sunglasses and a garage door remote.  Of course there are the typical seat-back pockets and mesh cargo pockets in the way back as well.  And there are another two pop-out cup-holders in the front for the passenger, and two more in the back...and another two in the far back. This makes for lots of comfort and convenience on long car rides.

Unfortunately, there are some down sides to the Chevy Suburban. There is a lot of play in the wheel and the brakes tend to feel &quot;loose,&quot; like when you step on the brakes...you suddenly feel like maybe you ought to step a little harder for fear of not stopping. The Suburban is a gas guzzler, but that is pretty typical of larger cars/SUVs.

The Suburban is a wonderful family car, as we can ride two carseats and six adults quite comfortably...and we can still fit the diaper-bags, strollers and other baby-paraphernalia as well.

The good points certainly out-weight the bad with this automobile and we will more-than-likely lease another one when our lease is up on this one.<br><br>
