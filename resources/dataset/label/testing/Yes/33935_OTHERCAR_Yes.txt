            I�m not born to write about cars, I get in them, I drive them, and if they get me where I�m going I�m happy.  I do take advice when making purchases and when I recently considered buying a PT Cruiser, I turned immediately to roadiem to check out whether the car had a solid suspension.  There are few writers in the English speaking opinion writing world who I consider to be required reading before making a buying decision.  Roadiem was one.

So for roadiem, here�s my experience of a 1998 model year VW Beetle, a car that I commuted around in, went shopping in, and, perhaps most appropriately, toured northern Michigan in.

Back in 1997/8 the VW Beetle was a must have car, it�s styling was such a break from the committee/computer designs of so many vehicles on the road which all seemed to have come from the same cookie cutter.  The Beetle looked both modern and retro, and being a good solid VW, there was little to get too stressed about in engineering terms.  Waiting lists could only be avoided by paying way over invoice, or, as in my case, snapping up a cancelled order with a slightly off standard specification.

It is a three door car, and despite being quite large on the exterior, it is rather pokey inside.  You can squeeze a couple of ankle biters in the back, but I wouldn�t recommend trying to transport adults for any real distance.  Really this car is a 2 + 2 rather than a genuine four-seater.

The key is a neat VW job that flips open, meaning you can keep it in your pocket without tearing anything.  It has remote opening that only opens the drivers door unless specifically requested to open both, for added security.  The key also opens the boot/trunk remotely so you don�t have to put your luggage or shopping down to load up.

The trunk is not very large.  It is fine for the weekly shop, but if you�re planning on a trip longer than a weekend, or if you�re planning to camp, your going to have to use the back seat for additional storage.  Another irritation is that the trunk does not always close properly.  It has a neat hydraulic finishing system so that the last couple of inches are closed gently to avoid slamming, but I�ve found that unless you position your hand exactly on the centre of the VW badge and apply precisely the right amount of pressure the trunk won�t close.  Even more irritatingly the trunk open warning light has been on more or less consistently over the last three years.  Every time it goes for a service this fault is noted, the fitters play with it, and the fault recurs.

The Beetle is a joy to drive. It pootles along quite happily at 80 on the freeway, and unusually for a car popular in America, it can actually corner.  It holds the road well, even in icy condtions.  The only problems I�ve had are in severe weather, where the relatively low ground clearance make it difficult to get out of the subdivision onto cleared roads.  This is a problem that I can live with for three days a year, and is unlikely to cause stress to anyone who lives in a temperate climate.

Gas mileage is good, and coming from a country that pays $5 a gallon, it�s something I check out.  I can get a good 350 miles or so of stop start city driving from one tank, more on a longer run.  

The Beetle though is not best suited to longer runs, it is very much a city car, with a tight turning circle and power steering that make it a joy to park.  The ultimate test in Detroit for a cars suspension is the corner of Coolidge and Fifteen, turning from Royal Oak into Birmingham.  Here there are potholes so deep and frequent that it�s enough to make a person pine for Yorkshire.  Engineers from Jaguar in Coventry, England have been known to make the trip to prepare plaster casts of this mini mountain range to test their vehicles.  The Beetle passes the Merchant of Vinos corner test with flying colors.  Whilst the unwary may lose a tooth or two, the suspension does enough to keep the car stuck to the road and the ride civilised, but not so much that you�re still bouncing at the Big Rock.

On longer runs the lack of interior space can become tiresome.  A neat little flower vase is not enough to convince you that you are in the great outdoors, and you will feel a little squished, necessitating several �leg stretching� breaks, but the car doesn�t complain, and on a 500mile/day marathons there was no sign of overheating or stress.  

Three years on my father still runs this Beetle day in, day out.  I�ve driven it to Washington, to Tahquamenon Falls, Chicago, and so on, usually cramming most of the driving into short six hour, 350 mile bursts with no more than one bathroom break, and it never complains.  

The Beetle was a little bit out of the ordinary way back when.  I constantly had people coming up to ask me about it, and to tell me of their experiences with the original Beetle, this was fun at first but could become annoying, but now this never happens.

I�d recommend the VW Beetle for anyone wanting a reliable, practical, yet fun city car, but if your daily commute tops 100 miles, or if your are prone to taking a number of weekend wilderness jaunts then think carefully before plumping for this super mini.
