            Leave it to Chevrolet to create an affordable economy car that you don't have to drive with your knees! The Cavalier is a car that does just about everything, all at a low price. Looking at it, it almost has a little voice of it's own coming from a smiling grill saying: &quot;Hey, drive me! We'll have fun together!&quot;

And fun I have indeed had with this car.

The fuel economy is great, $15.00 easily tops off the tank, and one tank lasts you many miles down the road.

I own the 4-door LX model, the economy car good enough to accommodate passengers in comfort, with all the &quot;little extras&quot; included. How many cars can boast aluminum wheels, power windows, power locks, keyless entry, an AM/FM radio with CD, tilt steering, dual airbags, cruise control and MORE for under $15,000.? Not many in this age....but the Chevy Cavalier delivers!

I admit, I'm a car's worst nightmare. I'm the irresponsible driver who often forgets oil changes, drives too fast, never washes the exterior....and tune-ups? Sheesh, I hardly know that word.

My 1996 LX has seen a hard road ahead of it. Now at over 110,000 miles she still hasn't given out, or even given a sign that she's not still willing to make that 45 mile drive to work for me everyday. I've changed one battery, two tires, a few oil changes, and that's it. No regular maintenance, no tune-ups. If there is one word that can sum up the Chevy Cavalier, DEPENDABILITY certainly says it all. 

Alas, with any automotive, there will be a drawback. The Cavalier falls apart interior-wise as well as exterior. Designed to be an easily, affordable mass-produced car for the working class, she's made cheaply. From her plastic door handles to the flimsy cloth seating (and I have the upgrade cloth!) the Cavalier is cheap..because it is made cheap. Cheaper materials equal a cheaper sticker price. A month after having my LX, the passenger side air-conditioning vent fell off. The dealer has put it back on 4 times. Guess what...it's still off. Knobs on the radio, same thing. 

But the good outshines the bad on this one...No matter where you are going..to the store, or cross country, Cavalier will get you there problem-free. A superior first car for the young, and a great car for those of any age who like keeping money in their wallet.

Hassle free, low maintenance, and fuel economical..it's a great car, and one I'm proud to recommend.
