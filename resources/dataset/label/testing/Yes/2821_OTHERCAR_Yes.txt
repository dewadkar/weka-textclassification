            I purchased a brand new Volkswagon Jetta GL in 1992.  My reasons for purchasing this vehicle were many.  I wanted a vehicle that was sophisticated looking without the price tag of a sophisticated car.  I also wanted great driving performance and gas mileage.  

This car gave me everything that I was looking for and cost only the price of a lower end vehicle.  This is a 4 door vehicle with a extra large trunk.  I have transported an amazing amount of camping gear in this car.  The Jetta has comfortable seats and is spacious.

This vehicle has amazing handling, performance, and suspension.  It takes corners like you wouldn't believe.  The gas mileage on this vehicle has also been very good, averaging about 23 miles per gallon.

This car is very economical in up keep and repairs.  There is one problem that I have continued to have with this vehicle.  It seems to have oil problems- it appears to be nothing serious as of yet, but it causes me stress thinking that there is a problem and taking it in to the dealership.  It goes through a good amount of oil.

This is a great looking car and very reliable.  It is the type of car that you can purchase on a lower income or be seen in with a higher income and still feel and appear to be driving in style.  Which you are.  I would recommend the purchase of this vehicle to anyone!<br><br>
