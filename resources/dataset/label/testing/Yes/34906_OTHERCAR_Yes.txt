            This car is awesome.  It has a huge amount of space and I think it is very comfortable.  My mom bought this car and I really like to ride in it.  It has air conditioner in the front, middle, and back.  It has a neat auto door feature if you want to put it on.  I recomend to buy this mini van if you are looking for a nice minivan with a lot of space.  It has a cd player.  It has a tape player.  It has Radio Controls on the steering wheel.  It has a strong engine.  Our previous Minivan was a Toyota Previa, which was a good van, But I like the Odysey more.  <br><br>
