            Great. One word. I used to have the Mavica FD-73, until it was &quot;misplaced&quot; at a car show. I operate a very graphic intensive website that require frequent updates of pictures and images. Every since losing my FD-73, I have been looking for a replacement. I wanted something with superb zoom, yet easy to use and transfer pictures to my computer. Although this unit was much bigger than its competitors, the features more than made it up for it.

Since most of my images end up on the web at 300x400, I wasn't too concerned with the megapixel rate nor the quality. My main goal was to have a camera that can ZOOM. I use it mainly at car shows and events where I can't get too close to the performers or entertainers. With this incredible 20x zoom, I'm able to take quality pictures without having to dig my way through a crowd. 

I used to prefer to use my Canon Rebel 2000 over the FD-73 because my pictures turn out better when using a view finder. I didn't like to have to rely on the LCD screen to frame my shots. But the trouble with taking real pictures is the after process of developing, scanning, and resizing. One of the main selling points of the FD-95 is its view finder, which evidently has a &quot;eye-sensing&quot; feature to avoid battery drain. 

The main reason Sony Mavicas are such hot sellers is because that they take floppy disks over smart media or cards. Floppy disks are cheap. The FD-95 allows me to record in 640x480 and up to 1600x1200 resolution. So no matter what resolution I decide to use, I can always have a stash of floppies in my bag to store them in. At 640x480, I can get as many as 35 pictures on to one floppy. I elected to buy the 64mb memory stick with floppy adapter which could store 5-600 pictures at one time. I still carry at least 5 floppies with me in case someone with me wants a copy of the pictures I'm taking. Sharing pictures with $.25 floppies are much cheaper than letting friends borrow your memory card, then worrying when they will return it.

The battery that comes with the FD-95 lasts about 2-230 images on average. This camera doesn't come with a charger, instead you get a cable that attached directly onto the camera. Therefore, you can actually use the camera while it is charging. I've also got the extended Sony InfoLithium battery which allows for 3-350 pictures per charge. A good investment if you take a lot of pictures while traveling.

The camera also comes with a hot shoe, but unfortunately you have to use the Sony external flash. I thought that any flash would work with it since the internal flash is often insufficient for taking pictures in poorly lit areas, such as car show buildings and night clubs. 

Most people who see my camera complain about the size. Yes, it is quite a large camera compared to most digitals available. I personally prefer larger cameras as they feel more comfortable in my hand. A big guy holding a tiny little camera looks funny to me. I've always had the perception that big cameras make the photographer look professional, lol. 

If you can get past the size and a little bit slower in image recording time, then this is the camera for you. I take an average of 4-500 pictures per event I attend so I am used to carrying a bag anyway. Now instead of rolls of film, I have a surplus of floppies and a batter or two. <br><br>
