               My wife and I bought a 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante wagon three years ago, it is in excellent condition with average miles on it. Our primary use for this car was road trips with the family, it is quiet, comfortable and rapid. This car devours pavement like Rosanne Barr at an all you can eat dessert buffet. Even at the supra-legal speeds at which we travel the car still delivers 21 MPG with the air on.
   It has more buttons than the space shuttle. The power leather seats are still comfortable, and looking like new at 100,000 miles, even with toddler grunge heaped upon them daily. The sunroof is quiet open or closed, the cassette and CD player are located in the dash where you can use them, and continue to work despite the location of the cup holders above, sloshing coffee and cola at will, amazing. Power is good, and delivered well by the four speed automatic. You can even take your tall friends for a ride in the back seat if you want. The Cargo bay is huge, swallowing prodigious amounts of stuff without batting it's well shaped lift hatch. There is a lot to like about this very fancy,quiet car,now the bad stuff...
   Handling is predictable but not good, huge understeer that can not be corrected even by lifting the throttle, due to lack of drag from the efficient slush box, but that's Ok because if the road isn't bone dry it gets much worse. The same qualities that we enjoy on the highway all work against this car on the back roads, not a big deal if you don't do any spirited driving though. 
   Now what about that motor, a 3.0 liter V6 with single overhead camshafts and three valves per cylinder. The valve seats are poorly designed and prevent the valves from closing properly over time. Great for losing your arch enemy in a James Bond cloud of smoke during a chase, or embarrassing if your pulling away from the grocery store. We go to the grocery store more often, so fix it right? Ahh there is the rub, you could replace the valve seats for around $550 including labor, but the problem would just reoccur, so it takes a little custom head work( read expensive )to remedy the situation, around $1200, ouch. The power windows are also suspect, they are operated by a small motor spooling some small diameter cable, sounds weird eh? It is, and they break and work slowly in cold weather, they are also expensive to fix.
   So the bottom line is that this very handsome car may be a good used purchase if you know the repair history of these items, or you could purchase one in good condition well below wholesale book value. Which may not be tough to do, as these problems coupled with the brand anonimity of this luxury car are well known by any good car salesman, dropping it's value, get out your thumb screws. Only under these circumstances would I recommend this car to a friend. <br><br>
