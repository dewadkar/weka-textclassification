            If you are looking for a true sports car that happens to have four doors, then look no further. Through the GS 430, Lexus has created a four door sedan than truly has a race inspired design. Lexus has always been known for its quality and craftsmanship, and the GS 430 is no different. Lexus combines powerful acceleration, tight handling, luxury, and sharp looks into the GS 430.

The power plant comes from a new 4.3 liter V8 that produces 300 peak horsepower. The engine is renovation on an older 4.0 liter V8 that was used in the GS 400. The difference is that the 4.3 liter motor produces more torque with sacrificing any fuel economy.

One of the major downsides is that the GS 430 is not available in a manual transmission. To its designers credit though, the standard 5-speed automatic transmission is excellent. It offers smooth shifting at all RPM's and provides exceptional power transfer between gears.

Luxury and roominess are not sacrificed with all this performance. The front seats are roomy even for the tallest drivers and the back seats are better than most midsize sedans. All of this is upholstered in a soft, but durable leather. The audio system is excellent as well. The vehicle that I drove was equipped with a 6 CD changer, but I am not sure if that is standard or an option. The speakers provided crisp highs and deep lows.

Overall this car is a winner. It has the practicality of a family sedan, but an a$$ kicking V8 that will leave just anybody in the dust. This coupled with excellent handling makes it truly a luxury car, sports car, and family sedan wrapped in one nice package.<br><br>
