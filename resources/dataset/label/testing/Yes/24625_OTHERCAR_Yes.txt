            I have an Infiniti I30, and I have to say it is one of the best cars out there to buy. There seem to be a ton of luxury cars to choose from, but for the best quality and luxury for a small price, this is the car to go to. It has a perfectly smooth ride and the control is excellent. I had friends who owned I30's and recommended me to get one. It has good speed and pickup also. Some features that i really enjoy are the leather seats. They are very comfortable and I find other passengers in the car seem to enjoy it too. The BOSE sound system of one of the best I have ever seen. If you choose the BOSE system, you get a 6-speaker surround sound stereo with cassette and CD. You can get an optional disc changer too. The car has plenty of room also. One major reason why I liked it is because my kids have plenty of room in the back. Sometimes they would get somewhat territorial on long trips, and needed space. So this car had plenty of extra room in the back, plus even an adult can fit comfortably in the back.<br><br>
