            If you are considering any new car, wagon or sedan, you must drive a Subaru first.  I am on my third.  My cars have been problem free.  The Outback Wagon is especially great.  Others in my family have owned SUV's, but the Outback outclasses the Jeeps, Blazers, and Explorers which have come and gone.  First of all, (and right to the pocketbook) the Outback can make a set of good tires last longer than any truck-like SUV.  This proved itself over and over.  Secondly, compared to it's truckish competition, the Outback has as much space, a better ride and handling characteristic, much better fuel economy, fewer repairs, better styling (ok, that is personal), and is much quieter on the road.
Now, there are a few things which you give up.  The four cylinder engine is a little less powerful than the six banger trucks.  Who cares?  This car is plenty quick for today's acceleration needs, and is lighter to boot.  Also, if you are over six feet, you will want to make sure you can get comfortable in the front seat.  Subaru does not make a power seat (as of model year 1999) and it is not always perfect for tall people.
For sedan buyers, there are even more reasons to buy an ALL WHEEL DRIVE vehicle instead of front or rear wheel drive.  Unfortunately, you never know this until you wreck your new Accord because your rear wheel were merely along for the ride.
