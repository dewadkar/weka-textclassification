            Note: This opinion is more oriented to the crowd that are curious of how much fun it is to drive the new Golf. 
I've been driving the Golf GL (2-door) with the standard 2.0 4-banger mated to a 5 speed manual transmission for 6 months. I'm 25 and it's my first car. I've been driving it everyday since late summer though winter. 
First of all, I've always loved cars, loved rally racing, the Formula One Grand Prix. I deem this to be relevant to this opinion since I've taken the Golf onto a few back roads and a racing circuit, learning how it handles, what its good and bad traits are. I got the 15&quot; mags that were a 300$ option (a GREAT deal imo - they look great, not too flashy but still give the already muscular look a dose of steroids) :) On to the performance:

0-60 is not impressive at all. Roughly 10 secs. Max Torque kicks in at 2600 rpm, which means you can easily burn rubber in 1st and 2nd gear. Max HP is at 5200 rpm. It'll jump off the line quickly, surprising the Honda Civic SI driver next to you till 30-40 mph, then he'll beat you easily. The 2.0 liter's torque seems to fall off above ~4750 rpms, so try to keep the rpms between 2600 and 4750. The engine does have enough grunt to do some effective passing in 5th gear on the highway. Downshifting to 4th will help, but forget 3rd - all you get is a screaming engine and no guts :(. 

Gearbox is loose, not as accurate as the Integra's, Impreza's or the BMW 528i's. I've missed a few shifts in it. Clutch has a good feel, no stutter what so ever no matter how hard it is driven or how hot/cold it is outside. Gearing in 5th is high, which means a relatively droney ~3000 rpm @ 60 MPH. One has to boost the stereo considerably to mask the engine drone at highway speeds. For ppl that care, the engine sounds nice from the inside (has a very slight whine @ ~3000 rpms - I love it ^_^), bad from the outside. Fuel economy isn't that great.

Handling is predictable. Suspension is soft, the body rolls considerably but is surprisingly quite controllable. Picture this: Driving at 75 mph, having to take an indicated 40 mph 90 degree left hand turn. Braking is simply GREAT in the new Golf (ABS 4-wheel disk brakes standard - sensitive pedal though - took me a while to get used to). As you brake (and downshift) for the turn, the car nose dives moderately. During turn-in, the inside left rear wheel locks up, but that's instantly taken care of by ABS which makes the Golf feel very good in turn-in. As you approach the apex (hopefully off the brakes by now), the car begins to lean considerably and tends to understeer a bit. Passing the apex, flooring the car in 2nd will make it understeer a lot (no steering input will overcome it) and will make a mess of your day. 3rd gear will still make you understeer, but it'll be far more predictable. If you must use 2nd, add power gently cause if one floors it, then lets off cause of the understeer, the rear end of the car might kick loose which is BAD O_O. 
This is typical of front wheel drive cars, but I noticed it a lot more in the Golf than in the Integra '99 (stiffer suspension, better weight distribution?)

Highway driving is comfortable. The seats are wide enough for my skinny butt to move positions. :) Rear vision is good for backing up, adequate for checking blind spots. Controls are all in logical places. Radio (which is surprisingly good for a stock one - features and power) controls can be accessed while resting hand on the shifter (in 1st/3rd/5th gears) (yes, yes, I know one shouldn't do that, but that's one of my bad habits) without looking down. The night blue/red colors are pleasing to the eyes. Instruments are well lit, there's no guessing what a control does. All passengers have reading lights that don't bother me. The added mini-sun visor between the roof and the rear view mirror is a good feature. Cup holders work well. Heater takes 4 mins to warm up and about 7-8 for max heat. AC works well no matter how hot it is outside. Keyless entry and alarm is obviously very useful. Car originally had no squeaks but now has a few in the trunk/backseat area. There's ample storage room for moving large items. 
Oh yah, have doubts that the Golf is a small car and won't be able to carry yer large buddies? Think again. I had 4 large (200 to 330 lbs buddies) in the car and they weren't complaining. :) 

Overall fun to drive: A HELL OF A LOT OF FUN! That's the surprising part of it. The leaning, understeer is predictable while the 2.0 has some low end grunt. It's a great car for its price. What it loses in engine refinement and soft suspension it makes up in sheer fun to drive and loads of nice features that are lacking in the competition (Impreza, Integra). It looks damn good - the wheel flares, especially seen from the rear makes it look aggressive and stocky for a hatchback. The front light arrangement looks mean! Furthermore, insurance rates are also not as high. 

Take the new Golf (1999-2000 - same model) for a serious spin. Overall a good car.
