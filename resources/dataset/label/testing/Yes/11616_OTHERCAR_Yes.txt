            I purchased my '92 Sentra on July of '97. Even though this is the first vehicle I've own, Its by far one of the most reliable cars Nissan manufactures. After owning this car only for 2 years, I've only had one instance where this vehicle has left me stranded, which was a bad battery. Good aspects of this vehicle are, reliability, few maintenance repairs, and overall quality. The Sentra does give a good handling feel even for a vehicle with 127,000+ miles with OEM equipment.

The attributes that would make the Nissan Sentra the perfect family car is more comfort, more cabin space, and less frequent brake jobs. An increase in comfort would be the addition of a larger glove box, more accurate seat adjustments and a bit more foot room. Lack of cabin space is actually quite common with most cars in its class, but a bit more head room wouldn't hurt. I'm 6 ft. and feel somewhat huge in my little sentra. The last attribute is a pretty costly one considering Nissan OEM replacements for brake pads are semi-metallic pads. Semi-metallics wear fast and are not the cheapest pads in the market of braking systems/parts but will give you excellent braking power.

Overall, I enjoy owning my '92 Sentra and if I had the choice to buy it again, 42,000 miles ago, I wouldn't pass it up. Nissan's Sentra is an ideal compact car that excels with the Honda's Civic in its class.
