            Today was the first day that I had used this particular camera. I am taking a photography course and the camera for the course is the Kodak DCS-520. At first I was scared by the camera, just because of the way that it looks, but as everyone knows, looks can be deceiving.

This camera is very easy to use and very user friendly. The auto focus of the camera eliminates the need to manually focus. It can be used with almost any type of lens, either normal, zoom, or tele photo. The camera's memory can store hundreds of pictures with ease. Well, what about using up the battery, or the old complaint &quot;The battery will develop a memory&quot; Not true with this baby. You can rechare the lithium battery in this bad boy from any level. Take one picture and recharge it, or use it all day and night and recharge. IT DOESN'T MATTER. The battery on this camera doesn't develop a memory! Can't beat that!

What if I want to store my pictures in a different place than my spouse? Can that be done? OF COURSE! You are able to choose different 'folders' for pictures to be stored in! You can have one for graduations, retirements, weddings or family gatherings. Then all that is left is to download the pictures to the family computer. 

Some of you might ask the question, do I have to worry about shutter speeds or the F Stop with this camera. NOPE. This camera does everything, except find a good object to take pictures of. Focusing, adjusting for lighting and shutter speed are all taken care of by a small processor located in the body of the camera. You can't beat that!

It looks to awkward to carry around. How am I supposed to lug that big boy around the Smithsonian? Good question. This camera comes with a large strap that can be slung either over the shoulder or around the neck. Additioinally, there is a strap that goes over the hand when you are holding the camera, ready to take that prize winning photo.

Well, how will I know what my pictures look like? Good question. The answer - LCD display. The camera displays all photos on the LCD display located on the back of the camera body. It is very easy to cycle through them. All you do is push a button and turn the thumbwheel also located on the back of the camera body, and your pictures are presented like a mini slide show!

Anyone who is enthusiastic about their photo taking should get a hold of one of these cameras. You will not be sorry!<br><br>
