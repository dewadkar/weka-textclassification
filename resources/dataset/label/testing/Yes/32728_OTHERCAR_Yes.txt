            We have a 1996 Mazda 626 LX.  This is my second 626.  My first 626 (1993) was traded in when there were some expensive air bag problems, but the dealer was more than happy to take care of the problem as part of the trade.  I got the 96 626 brand new and have been very happy with it.  

My 626 came with a CD player, power everything and a sun-roof.  There have been no problems in the past three years.  There have been two recalls on the car but these were fixed in less than half an hour by the dealer.  

The one thing that I do not like about the 96 626 is the headroom.  I don't know if it because of the power sunroof, but at 6'2&quot;, the top of my hair touches the roof.  The car also needs bigger cup holders.

My 96 Mazda is better than my 93, and from a friends raves about his new 626, I can only assume that the improvements continue. My Mazda 626 run great, looks good, and has been problem free.  In the subdivision where I live, there are about 5 626's and everyone has the same opinion about their car.... it's a keeper.
