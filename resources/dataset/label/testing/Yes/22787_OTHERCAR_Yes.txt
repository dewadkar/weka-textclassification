            My girlfriend and I shopped around for quite some time before deciding on the Accent.  We took advantage of end of model year savings and bought a 99 model.  Its a sporty little car that will out run a Civic of equal options and is comfortable enough to ride in for longer trips.  She babysits and there is enough access to the rear seat, even for a two door, to get the car seat in and out.  The car feels safer than my Mazda 626 in the rain.  We have only had to take it to the shop once because a speaker came unhooked in the door and i didn't want to damage the panel taking it apart.  I was extremely impressed w/ the service we received, brought the car in at 8am and had it back by 4pm w/ both front speakers replaced and the had checked out a noise from the front(loose head light).  The only down side I can see is the 13&quot; tires that are standard.  As soon as the budget allows we are upgrading to 15&quot; wheels.  How can you beat a car w/ a 10year warranty on drivetrain, 5 yr bumper to bumper including paint for under $10,000? Hyundai has definately come a long way in the last few years.<br><br>
