            A truly awesome vehicle, putting the joy back into driving.  I jump out of bed every morning just to get behind the wheel of my Jeep.

I commute to work 40 miles a day in utmost comfort.  The seats in these vehicles are more upright than other vehicles not only making them more comfortable but also are good for your posture.

I have also driven on long road trips and have found the drive and comfort of the vehicle to be excellent.  The only problem I have found is the lack of cargo space for suitcases, skis etc.  However Jeep does carry an excellent line of racks for the rear tire or the roof.

The very best part of the vehicle is the changing of its look.  In the summer you can pull the top off completely, remove the doors, put the front window down or leave the top on and remove the doors or put on a bikini top or any other combination of the above.

A friend of mine has an older Jeep and he has troubles taking the top on and off due to the 'snaps' that hold the top on.  The new system on the 97 Jeep is much easier - it takes only about 3 minutes to take the top off and five to six to put it back on. 

Another difference between the old and new Jeep is the ride, the 97 is much smoother with no bounce to the ride.<br><br>
