            The VW Jetta has gotten much better over the past years.  As a current owner of model years '89 and '95, I can say we can certainly say these engineers know what they are doing.  The Jetta has come from  ('89) a boxy little model that sometimes can feel like a sprightly tin can, with a phenomenal turning radius and uncomfortable seats to a higher sitting, intuitively laid out dash controls, great handling performance vehicle.  The 95 model has extremely comfortable seats.  A sunroof/moonroof is a must, but be careful because sometimes they need adjustment so they don't whistle on the highway.  The stereo is great, but a better antenna would make it better.   The paint seems to chip easily, and the velour fabric seems to wear a little easily.  
THIS CAR IS SO FUN TO DRIVE, it is sporty without the v6, and sometimes itï¿½s hard to keep it under 85mph!  The car easily fit my size (5'3&quot;) and my boyfriend (6'1&quot;).  The mileage for the standard transmission is usually 27-mpg.
