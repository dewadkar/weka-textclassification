            Buying a car is a tough experience.  Being a woman buying a new car was a terrifying experience - at first.  I am not a wealthy girl.  My dream car was the Volkswagon New Beetle but I just couldn't afford it.  So, I started looking elsewhere.  I checked several car companies over the internet looking for an inexpensive car.  I had found several options when I first laid eyes on the new Toyota ECHO.  It was love at first site.  

I went for a test drive at my local Toyota dealership with my father (a one-time mechanic) and he and I both LOVED it.  He was particularly impressed with the low-maintenance aspect of the vehicle (for example, the timing belt is a chain and doesn't need to be replaced). I test drove only a stick, not an automatic so I can't speak for that but the stick has a LOT of go power.  I got to 60 mph by the end of the freeway entrance ramp!  It was also surprisingly roomy for what seems to be a very small car.  A very interesting feature is the placement of the indicators.  Rather than being set behind the steering wheel where it's always been difficult for me to see them, they're set on the top center of the dashboard and turned toward the driver.  I also very much enjoyed the height of the seats in the car.  It felt a lot like driving an SUV.  I bought the car on the spot.

I've only had this car for a week but I've driven over 300 miles and haven't had to fill the tank yet.  It's already taken me through a major cold spell and temperatures well below zero.  

I'm trying very hard to come up with something bad about this car.  The only thing I can think of is this:  It's very hard to find and they tend to come with certain options.  You can't generally buy a base model with no options and it would take months to get one with the exact options you want if they're not the ones that usually come in the car.  The options that I got for my nearly $12,000 were air conditioning, power steering, and an all-weather guard package.  A lot of them come with a pricey $600-$700 6 speaker CD system.  Mine came with the standard AM/FM radio, no cassette or CD, and only 4 speakers.

I still love my car!  I'd recommend it highly to anyone.<br><br>
