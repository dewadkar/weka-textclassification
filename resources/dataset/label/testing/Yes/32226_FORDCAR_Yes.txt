            I have owned several Ford SUV's starting with an 85 Bronco II. Then I went to an 89 on to a 91 Mazda Navajo and now the 95 Bronco.  I have loved them all.  I was looking for a car with a rear window that went down so that my dogs could get air without jumping out (as possible with a flip up window that I had in all the others).  The only two cars available at that time were the Bronco and the Land Cruiser.  I was a contract employee for a LARGE Toyota dealer but even with the discount they were 5-7K more than the Bronco.  
I found this car (an Eddie Bauer) with all the trimmings at a dealership that I was just passing while on a trip.  It was such a good deal I couldn't pass it up.  
I now have 100k miles and I still love the car.  Sure it's style is older and kind of boxy but it is roomy (I'm tall), very easy to drive, comfortable and there is lot's of cargo room for my 4 &quot;kids&quot; (all 600#'s of them).  I have even carried a sick 200# goat in my lap in the back while someone drove me to the vet.  What can I say I love my animals.
I still have my original 85 Bronco II which looks like a baby version of the full sized Bronco.  It has 130k miles but doesn't get driven much any more.  I guess I will drive the 95 until it dies...they just don't make them like that any more!<br><br>
