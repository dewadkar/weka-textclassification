            After driving both a 1992 Honda Accord LX and 1991 Ford Escort Pony, I was ready for an upgrade.  

My husband and I did some research, and finally came to the conclusion that we liked the way that the <b>Chevrolet Impala</b> looked, and with an estimated 32 MPG on the highway and 21 in the city the benefits outweighed everything else.

According to the Chevrolet website, the <b>2002 Impala Sedan</b> starts at just over $20,000.  In reality, the price for the base model is actually a bit less.  The sportier <b>2002 Impala LS</b> model starts at over $24,000.  There is also the soon-to-be-released <b>2002 Impala LS Sports Appearance Package</b> that costs over $25,000.  Since we purchased the <b>Impala LS</b>, most of this opinion will deal with that model.  In addition, my family qualifies for the GM Option 1 discount on all new vehicles.  

The <b>2002 Impala LS</b> comes equipped with some great standard features:
-	200 horsepower 3.8 liter V6 engine
-	4-speed automatic transmission
-	Traction control
-	Disc brakes with ABS
-	16-inch aluminum wheels
-	Sport Touring Suspension
-	Fog Lamps
-	Spoiler
-	AM/FM stereo with cassette player and Radio Data System
-	Dual temperature controls for driver and front passenger
-	Front airbags and driver side-impact air bag
-	Power driver seat
-	Sport cloth front bucket seats including center console
-	OnStar featuring one year Safety & Security package

Of these features, most important to note is the large Chevy engine.  This 3.8 liter V6 engine is known for lasting to 200,000 miles on a pretty routine basis.  The Dual temperature controls are also a great feature.  If one person likes the air to be a bit warmer, they can turn the controls up.  Also, the power seat allows the user to move the seat front or back, up or down, or tilt it for comfort.

In addition, we added another preferred equipment group.  With this, we were given the following features:
-	Remote keyless entry
-	Illuminated visor mirrors
-	Cargo Net
-	Cruise Control
-	Overhead console with storage bin
-	Assist grips with courtesy lights
-	Reading lights on rearview mirror
-	Steering wheel controls (radio and cruise control)
-	Driver information convenience center
-	AM/FM stereo with CD player

Of these options, the cargo net is extremely useful.  Since the trunk is a large 18.1 cubit feet, this extra convenience helps to keep small items from rolling to the back of the trunk.  The steering wheel radio controls are also a great feature of the <b>Impala LS</b>.  Rather than reaching to the middle of the car to change the station or volume, it's easy just to use your thumbs on the buttons in the center of the steering wheel.  Also, the keyless entry that controls the locks and trunk is a great convenience.

There were various upgrades on our car.  Most important was the addition of 60/40 seats in leather.  This option allowed for a split fold-down rear seat.  Dual heated seats.  Dual power seats.  Also, the driver&#146s seat is equipped with manual lumbar control.

Our radio is also an upgrade.  It includes a CD and cassette player.  Also, a seek and scan function, a digital clock, TheftLock, speed compensated volume, RDS, premium 6-speaker system, and an aux amplifier.  The stereo sounds great and is easy to control from either the steering wheel or traditional stereo.  

Our tan leather interior is nicely accented by a Medium Bronzemist Metalllic exterior.  Also available for exterior colors are:  Galaxy Silver Metallic, Black, Dark Carmine Red Metallic, Navy Blue Metallic, Forest Green Metallic, White, Sandrift Metallic, and Bright Red.  There are only a few options for upholstery besides the aforementioned tan leather:  Medium Gray, Regal Blue, and Neutral.  

As I already mentioned, the thing that attracted me to the <b>Impala</b> initially was the sleek sporty styling.  The fact that the car comes only in a 4-door model was also a great draw.  I was sick of throwing things over my head into the back seat.  The black trim and &#145theater seating&#146 back seats also make this a distinctive and for that matter very visually attractive vehicle.  The <b>Impala LS</b>, classified as a large car, gets an impressive 19 MPG in the city and 29 on the highway.  The smaller engine (standard in the Sedan) is a V6 3.4 liter and gets as much as 32MPG on the highway.  Very impressive considering the roominess of both the interior and trunk.  In driving the car now for two years I've found the numbers to be accurate.  My average MPG is usually around 24 which combines city and expressway driving.  Again, a very pleasing result for a large vehicle.

My <b>Impala</b> handles incredibly well.  It handles significantly better than the other vehicles I've driven.  It handles corners well not to mention potholes (for which South East Michigan is famous).  I'm particularly pleased with the winter performance.  This is very important to me as a commuter.  The anti-lock breaks work well and don't come on while driving over bumps (a problem in my husband's 2002 Taurus SE).  And the traction control gives the big car the extra power and control necessary for the season.  

The <b>Chevy Impala</b> can trailer up to 1000lbs with a maximum tongue load of 100lbs.  Therefore, it&#146s adequate for very light loads.

Also impressive is the legroom.  My husband and I are both tall (I'm 5'10" and he's 6'0").  Neither of us feels cramped in the front or back seat.  And, with highly adjustable driver and passenger seats, this car should be very comfortable for most (if not all) drivers.

So far as safety goes, the <b>Impala</b> standard Driver and Passenger airbags and options side impact airbag are very good.  Also included in my model are ABS brakes and traction control.  Even the base model also includes Child Safety locks.   The high front and side impact crash test scores also prove that this is a very safe vehicle.

Overall, the <b>Chevrolet Impala</b> is a great car.  The body style was new as of 2000.  The <b>Impala</b> was first introduced by <b>Chevy</b> in 1959.  With a new front wheel drive, this <b>2002</b> model is a complete redesign of earlier models.  Competitive vehicles are cars like the Ford Taurus, Dodge Intrepid, Pontiac Grand Prix, Buick LeSabre, Honda Accord, and Oldsmobile Intrigue.  Personally, I find that the options of this vehicle are impressive enough to surpass any one of those mentioned vehicles.  In buying a new car I did limit my options (the GM discount was too good to pass up) but settled on the <b>Impala</b> because of the comfort level, safety, and fuel economy.  We chose it over the Grand Prix because we liked the price and looks slightly better (same goes for the LeSabre and Intrigue).

In the two years and over fifty thousand miles I've driven my <b>Chevy Impala</b> I have yet to have any mechanical problems.  Does that make it perfect?  Damn near.  Does that makes it a great bargain?  Certainly.  I really couldn't be any happier as a first time new car buyer.  My only minor complaint are the squeaky breaks--but I can deal with that on the car which has proven to be incredibly reliable.  

Even though I really don&#146t know better thanks to my previous vehicles (still sitting in my driveway, thank you), the <b>2002 Chevy Impala</b> is a great vehicle.  I love the looks, the value, the trunk space, the stereo, and so much more.  If you&#146re looking for a new family-sized car, check out this car&#133if you can find one&#133lots are running out very quickly.
