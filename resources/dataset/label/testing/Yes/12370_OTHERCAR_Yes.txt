            I've got a 1997 Mercury Sable GS and I LOVE THIS CAR! It's the familys car, and it does everything! It's got nearly 38,000 miles and has never had any sign of trouble.

Late last year, I was in a wreck with the Sable. I woman in a 1998 Ponitac Grand AM took a yeild on green for a green arrow and pulled out in front of me. We hit, and the Sable's anti-lock brakes kept me from sliding and doing even more damage. After hitting her, I ran up on a (empty) sidewalk and then into a sign and gaurd rail. My car started and was driven to the tow truck and eventually fixed for $8000+, while her Ponti was totaled. It did MUCH worse than the Sable, and had to be pushed off the highway. Noone was hurt seriously, and the accident was ruled her fault. I have written a letter to Ford Motor Company thanking them for the Five Star crash protection they built into the Sable.

After it was fixed, the Sable drives great. An old man in a Buick asked me at a gas station what car it was. I told him the above story, and how great the car is, and pointed him toward a local Mercury dealer. A week later, I saw him driving a 1999 LS Premium, same color as mine! He gave me a big thumbs up! Another satisfied Mercury Sable owner!  <br><br>
