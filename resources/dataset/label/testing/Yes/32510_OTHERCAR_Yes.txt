            I was ready to buy a 2002 VW Passat  GLS 1.8T (5-Speed Manual, Luxury Package, Leather, Monsoon) but I thought I would drive a 2002 A4 before making my final decision. While I really liked the Passat, there were a few things I didn't like about it:

- Some VW dealers just plain stink (like the one near me)
- Passat's suspension is too soft and floaty for my tastes
- The 15" wheels and tires are the only choice from VW with the GLS

The last two objections could have been fixed with aftermarket parts, but since I lease, I like to pick up the car at the dealership equipped the way I will drive it. 

I test drove several Audi A4 FWD variants and was blown away with the difference! Definitely a cut above the Passat and the previous A4.

I live in Florida so I don't need the Quattro system. Besides, the FWD A4 1.8T with a manual transmission is the lightest A4 you can buy - Good for performance and a lower price.

While I feel that the CVT transmission is an excellent choice for those who drive in heavy traffic or have an aversion to a manual transmission, the 1.8T engine runs best with a manual transmission, plain and simple. Many people on the Audi boards will tell you that  Audi engines are detuned by the engine management computer for the first few thousand miles to facilitate a better engine break-in. This seemed evident to me as I drove one with a CVT transmission with 5000 miles on it -  this one had VERY nice acceleration. Later, I drove another A4 1.8T of the same trim level and then a A4 3.0 FWD CVT, both with under 200 miles on the odometers - both felt underpowered and sluggish. Therefore, don't be alarmed if the Audi that you test drive feels a little sluggish when new - the computer is just protecting the new engine.

I was also impressed with the stiffness of the body structure. Compared to the 2002 Passat, the A4 is approximately 35% stiffer - and the Passat is no ripe banana. I drove several 1.8T FWDs with both the Sport Suspension with 17" wheels and the Standard Suspension with the 16" wheel option. While the stock A4 suspension felt much more tight and controlled at highway speeds than the Passat, the Sport Suspension propelled the A4 into another league altogether. It still retained a relatively smooth ride on most road surfaces but felt like it was riding on rails in the turns. Unless you live in snow country, I would opt for the Sport Suspension. Drive them both and make this decision from the seat of your pants.

The new A4 interior is absolutely impeccable! Even the Leatherette puts many $30,000+ cars to shame. For 2003, in the 1.8T models, the Leatherette will be replaced by real leather on the seating surfaces. 

I just ordered a 2003 A4 from my local Audi Dealer. While it will cost me around $3000 more than for a comparable Passat, I feel that the A4 is well worth it for the additional value. Can't wait until September!
