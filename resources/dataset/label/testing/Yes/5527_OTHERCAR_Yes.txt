            I love my Park Ave.
it makes me feel as if I live on Park Ave.

It is classy looking, comfortable and not a gas guzzler.

The insurance wasn't that high for it either.

I had no problems with my car for the pass year, though right now, I must be honest, the car is in the shop...something to do with the timing chain.
(don't ask me what that is, I just drive it, don't know nothing under the hood)

I have used this car for long trips, over steep hills, on dirt roads and even once in the midst of the forest. 

It still looks new. I rarely found a car that can take the bumps and bruises from a family inside, but this car is a lucky one.

A big plus for the miles I put on it, and the miles it goes during deer hunting and summer fishing trips. Gas mil. is real fair also. Oil, real good..
Yes..My Park Ave. is my park ave. living...even in the country.<br><br>
