            Love this van-- lots of compliments like, "Nice van!" from hip, younger types.  

Dash is trippy blue and red.  Husband LOVES it, thinks that it is too cool.  I was ambivalent, and it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the contrast. At any rate, easy to read and find controls.

This van really handles like a car. Seats sit pretty high, like a Tahoe or other SUV, and with all the windows, lane changing is a breeze.

2nd row seats come out, and we can fit a large and medium Pet Porter in side by side.  There is a lot of aftermarket stuff out there, such as screens for the sliding windows, and swivel units for the front seats to face toward the rear (assume you have to remove the second row seats). Even tents to attach to the side door opening. 

Side curtains snap in for privacy... I can see lots of fun travel in the future.

Stereo system sounds terrific, and I use a Sony portable CD player, which is all I need.  You can get the optional CD changer installed under the passenger seat.

Great automatic climate control feature.  Set it to the temp you want, hit auto, and it will keep both front and back at a constant temperature.  Works very well.

Other great features, power/heated mirrors, fogs, rear washer/wiper, heated seats. Safety includes top notch braking, air bags, stability control.

I understand this is the last year of the Eurovan, which to VW enthusiasts may be a boon to the resale value...we chose black for that reason, but plan to keep it for at least five years.  Financing came in at under $500 for 60 months, so not bad.
