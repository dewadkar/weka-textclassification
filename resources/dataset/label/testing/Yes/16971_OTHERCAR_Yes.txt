            For people living in snow country, this vehicle is an excellent choice.  The all-wheel drive handles snow and ice with ease and also adds stability when driving on wet roads.
The RAV 4 is easy to handle, dependable, low maintenance and gets reasonable fuel enonomy for a SUV.  It is truly fun to drive and very easy to handle, park, back up, etc.  On the highway, it is stable and easy to drive except at high speeds.
Drawbacks are, it is small, somewhat underpowered, particularly at higher interstate speeds such as 75 MPH.<br><br>
