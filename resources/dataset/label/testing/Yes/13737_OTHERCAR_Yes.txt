            I bought my 1995 Infiniti J30 in the spring of 1999. As I was viewing all the dealer had to offer I noticed a great looking dark green sedan. I looked in the window and saw that it had everything that I was looking for in a car. It came STANDARD with power everything, sunroof, locks, windows,
CD player, leather, BOSE radio (the best sound system I have ever heard in my life) 8way electric front seats, heated front seats and a wood grain center console. 
              I decided to sit in it. Right then I knew that I was going to buy it. I took a test drive to my house to show my family. My kids loved it and so did my wife. I then drove back to the dealer and said that I wanted it and I drove it off the lot. (For $13,000)
             I love the engine, it is so peppy. It is a 3.0-liter V6 with 209-horse power. When I found out that it was a rear wheel drive I almost fainted because I have had very bad luck with my previous RWD's. But, even it the winter I didn�t have any trouble with it's handling. 
  After 84,000 miles I don�t know what I will do with out it,and i plan on keeping it until it shuts down,but i dont think that will happen any time soon!!!!
