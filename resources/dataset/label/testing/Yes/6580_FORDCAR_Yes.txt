            Should my numbers ever come up in the lottery I don't know if I'd choose the red Ferrari Maranello or the yellow Modena Spyder. Would I be posting to epinions through a massive LCD monitor or would I say what the heck and hang a plasma screen on the wall? Having a high disposable income might not be as carefree as it seems but at least one decision would be easy. There would be a Ford Lightning in my garage, painted in <i>&quot;Yes, Officer&quot;</i> red.

My history with this truck goes back to when I worked for a Ford dealer in Phoenix some years ago. Part of my job was to prepare the new vehicles after they came off the truck and test drive them to make sure everything was jake before they went on the lot. Frankly I didn't think much of the Lightning at first. A factory hotrodded pickup seemed like the punchline to a Jeff Foxworthy joke. All that changed the first time I had to drive one. From the rib hugging seats to the lumpy idle of the 351 cubic inch V-8 this truck promised to be more than a decal package and a set of cool wheels. By the time I got back from the first drive I was hooked. The Lightning vaulted close to the top of my Gottahaveit list and for the rest of my time at the job I kept a close eye out for Lightning's on every load of new cars that rolled in.

Still, I went for a test drive in the new Lightning with a fear of bad things to come. Second acts are rarely as good as the first and the somewhat crude nature of the original Lightning wouldn't play well in the more refined new F-series platform. 

Some changes are immediately apparent. In an effort to boost sales the Lightning gets a much more distinctive look this time. You had to look twice at the original to spot the differences from a regular truck but this one screams boy racer with NASCAR-style side exiting exhaust and a front airdam with more curves than Plastic Surgery Barbie. It works with the sleeker styling of the new bodystyle but I doubt it improves your chances of talking your way out of a ticket. The interior gets more attention this time, too. The seats of the original were the closest I've seen to racing seats in a production vehicle, plain looking but with grippy fabric, substantial bolstering and firm padding to keep you in place during abrupt cornering. The new seats look racier but sacrifice function for greater comfort and (someone's definition of) style. Another step back in my book, along with the white-face instrument gauges unique to the Lightning. These looked cool and retro when they came out a few years ago but now just seem like the tacky add-on they are.

Start the engine. The 351 SVO engine is long dead, replaced by a special version of the overhead cam Triton engine that now powers all F-series trucks. Gone too is the trademark idle of the original Lightning but that's the only complaint I can make about this engine. It is the big (5.4 Liter) Triton V-8, outfitted with special SVT heads and an intercooled supercharger. With 360hp on tap only the very limited Mustang Cobra R makes more power than the Lightning and not even the V-10 from the big pickups makes more torque. With 440 lb/ft of torque on tap at just 3,000 rpm (almost as much as the fabled Dodge V-10) the accelleration can snap your head back. The sensation is further aided by upshifts that are as positive and unmistakeable as something from a manual gearbox. But don't be fooled. The Lightning is actually slower to 60mph than the Cobra R or a Corvette. But because you sit higher and more upright it feels faster. 

And that's always been the magic of the Lightning. Like the acceleration, braking and turn-in feel like it's happening faster than in a sports car-while your brain is screaming a truck shouldn't be able to do this at all. The Lightning isn't a Corvette, or even a Mustang GT killer. But no sports car I've driven involves the driver more. Decide if the stopwatch is more important than the seat of your pants and decide accordingly.

Thankfully, the handling and braking of the Lightning was just as I remembered it, only better. Don't ask how they do it, but somehow Ford has made this thing stick in a corner like no pickup should. In one corner I was able to detect the beginnings of understeer at the limit, but I was also detecting the left side of my ribcage being crushed against the seat and a &quot;what the hell are you doing?&quot; stare from the salesman. End of that experiment. With all that torque on tap it wouldn't be hard to light up the Lamborghini-esque 295 profile tires, but how the truck behaves in power oversteer is for a wealthier man than I to discover. Otherwise, Ford deserves an award for so thouroughly masking the inherit handling problems of a pickup. The braking is immensely powerful and perfectly balanced despite having nearly all of the weight over the front tires and the live rear axle has none of the bad habits found in other trucks or even the Mustang GT. 

But with sports car performance comes sports car problems. The Lightning is only available with the standard cab and the stepside bed-the least spacious combination available for you and your cargo. The lowered stance and bodywork add-ons make any off road driving an expensive gamble, and nothing about this truck indicates that it would be less than a holy nightmare to drive on winter roads. Also, while paying $1,000 or more for new tires won't catch too many Corvette owners by surprize I suspect it will be a rude awakening for Lightning owners who haven't owned sports cars before.

The lowdown on the Lightning has been it's too toylike for truck guys and too truck like for the sports car set. I can't for a second recommend the Lightning to a construction crew, but for the great majority of pickup buyers it's something they might want to drive before they make a final decision. And if you are in the market for a Camaro Z-28, Mustang Cobra or other performance sports/GT, you really deserve to give the Lightning a try. Yeah, it's a truck. It's also one of the most entertaining and distinctive vehicles you can own in any class.
