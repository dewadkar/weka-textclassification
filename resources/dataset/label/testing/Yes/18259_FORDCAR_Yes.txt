            We bought the car because of the shape it was in and the price. It had about 96,000 miles on it when we bought it two years ago and now it's up to 136,000. Still running great. I love the room inside, and the back (station wagon) because we have two kids. It drives great, clutch feels nice, steers well. The seats could be a little more comfortable and I don't know that a really tall person would like it. I'm 5'4&quot;, hubby's 5'10&quot;. Carseats fit in it wonderfully, the back doors are nice and wide. I've owned two Escort wagons and the only thing I seem to see a trend in is they go through timing belts fairly quickly, about every 40,000 miles. Other than that, they're sound mechanically and run great! Great mileage, too.<br><br>
