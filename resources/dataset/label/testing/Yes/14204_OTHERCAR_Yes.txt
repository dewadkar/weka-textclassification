            The 2000 Infiniti G20 is a great combination of style, function and safety, yet an automobile marked &quot;Infiniti&quot; should be and is capable of so much more.  This car does have many of the features that the best sellers have such as Camry and Accord, with the added uniqueness, quality and �Signature Service� that the premium Nissan brand offers. There is a reason why the discontinuation of this model in 1996 was a financial nightmare for the Infiniti division of Nissan.  The G20 is a great car.  The 1st generation G20 had the highest resale of any car in its class (even more than Accord) and was rated most reliable in its class.  It was the best-kept secret of the 4-door compact world but sales were lagging due to tough competition in the entry-level luxury/sport sedan segment.  Basically, it got its but kicked by the more popular loaded versions of Accord and Camry and more prestigious 3-series by BMW.  The reason: the G20 is NOT an entry-level luxury sport sedan anymore, like Infiniti wants you to believe.  It is a great car, yes, but as I will show you it is unnecessarily out of its league.

Infiniti is very capable of meeting or even beating its competitors in the entry-level luxo/sport sedan market.  However they need to focus more on the whole �luxury� and �sport� thing though.  Changes need to be made to make it a real competitor in this class.  

Mechanically the G20 would be much more creditable as an entry-level luxury sedan if it were a G25 or G28.  Basically that means it needs more power.  �Luxury� and �power� are synonymous in the automobile world. The high-end Galant, Accord, 3-series, Jetta, Camry, 626, A-4, etc. all have V-6 options and are not really considered entry-level luxury cars.  And we�re talking around 200 horsepower in most of them.  Clearly, entry-level is hardly 145 horsepower for the luxury/sport market.  It is a shame that the beautiful and sporty-looking G20 is always left in the dust when the pedals hit the floor.  0-60 in 10.9 seconds is definitely not high performance, and it isn�t even mediocre performance for this class.  No matter how good the SR20 engine may be, the fact is it can�t compete with 6 cylinders.  It needs at least 20 to 30 more horses and more low-end torque.  Infiniti did get the suspension right, though.  The G20 shares a version of the Maxima/I-30�s rear suspension giving it a firm grip, yet smooth ride.  The brakes are amazingly smooth as well, even when you really push on the pedal.  The car is great to drive DOWN a canyon full of turns and obstacles, however driving UP is another story altogether.

On the interior the wood trim around the gearbox hardly qualifies as wood-trim interior.  It looks gimmicky because there is no other wood in the cabin to compliment it.  Again, a real wood-trimmed interior as seen in upscale Accords and in the 3-Series is a must in this class.  The gearbox panel is outdated and should have been designed more like the G20�s sister: the Primera.  The driver�s seat is powered but the passenger seat is not.  This is another obvious move to cut the cost of the G20, however two powered front seats are very common in its competitors.  The Global Positioning System, however, is an option you won�t find in most of the competition.  At $1,500 you won�t find many in the G20 either.  The sound system is adequate, better than a lot of the competition, but not the best.  A subwoofer would be a good addition for next year.  The G20 doesn�t have rear map lights unlike like a lot of its competitors, but its rear seats are comfortable enough for two adults.  The G20 acquired 60/40 split fold-down rear seats in 1999, but they can�t be locked.  The automatic climate control joined with the micro filter is world-class and probably the best feature inside the G20.  Dual front and side airbags, F/R crumple zones, child seat anchors and side impact beams provide modern safety, though there is no manual disable for the passenger-side airbag.  The car is properly appointed with leather and the Infiniti logo appears on the front seats and floor mats giving the car back some of that prestige it loses when you try to get this 2900lb car to move with the A/C on.  The gauge panel is done nicely and is easy to see during day and night driving.  Giving the G20 the new florescent back lit gauges like on the 2001 QX4 would help Infiniti define this car into the luxury/sport class.  

The exterior is definitely in the gene pool of the G20 and Infiniti.  Rethought in �99, the 2000 G20 sports a beautiful chrome-trimmed grill and nice 15� alloy wheels.  Side signal lights and the �squared yet rounded� look gives it a European look.  16-inch alloy wheels on the touring model would be a nice addition visually, and of course would help out on the skid-pad.  Xenon headlamps would be a nice trend-setting option.  

Overall, This is a great car with much more style, prestige, performance, uniqueness, and features than the average compact sedan.  The G20 is dressed well and is very attractive and sporty looking�unfortunately looks can be deceiving and the average compact sedan isn�t its competition.
