            I have owned my last vehicle for ten years.  It was a Toyota truck.  I liked my truck, however, I was looking for something more.  I am a 29 year old female and I wanted something more practical than a truck but with the feel and hauling capabilities of a truck.  Kind of like the best of both worlds.  I decided on buying a Ford Explorer because everyone I spoke to only had good things to say about them.  At first I thought they were too family-like.  Then I got to looking more closely and realized that their two door model &quot;Sport&quot; was really quite sporty looking.  

I bought a 1996 Ford Explorer Sport from a retired Ford executive.  He took very good care of the vehicle, it looked like new.  I really like the ride and the comfort.  It rides like a Cadillac.  I also love the fact that I feel like I am still driving a truck.  I am a truck lover and have vowed never to own a two wheel drive or a car ever again.  

I have only owned the Explorer for a month but I am very pleased with my purchase.  I feel very confident that I will drive this SUV for ten years.
