                 Well how do I begin, I love this Truck.  It looks sleek but still retains that traditional General Motors appeal.  Recently I had a chance to drive a Ford Expedition, and I will take my Suburban in a heartbeat.  Whenever I am in traffic or cursing the open road I always feel safe in my GMC Suburban, it is thou I am in my own little leather world.  The sound system is easy to control my two kids love having there own seats.  The rear seat folds down for an incredible large storage space (it can be removed).  When removed the second row seats fold flat as though it was a truck bed.  I believe that large families will love the room as well as those who are avid outdoorsmen.  If you donï¿½t like trucks avoid this one.<br><br>
