            I bought this vehicle because I wanted a reliable, comfortable compact car with good power and handling.  The good news is that it seems to be all of that.

The bad news is that the seats in the car were, apparently, designed for 5'2 people, since I (a 6' tall 200 lb man) have taken a great deal of aggravation from the seats, particularly the overdone bolsters (which press into my left leg enough to cause me pain) and the too-short headrest which doesn't quite come up to the center back of my head.

It's too bad about the seats though, because the rest of the car is a wonderful vehicle.  The vehicle feels very nimble in turns (such as when taking an off-ramp at 40 MPH, the car feels composed), possesses an excellent amount of power for a small vehicle (merging into crowded traffic merely requires a squirt of the accelerator), easy to modulate brakes, and has been trouble-free during the 6 months/23,000 miles which I've had it.

The air conditioning and heating work very well (although the fan is fairly noisy) to quickly cool or heat the cabin, and the automatic works well with the 120 HP Zetec engine to provide good performance.  In fact, if you stomp the accelerator, the car's computer will turn off the air conditioning so you get maximum power.

The rear seats are the split fold-down variety and grant extra cargo space, although even with them down, there isn't enough room to put a mountain bike in the trunk, since it won't fit through the opening into the back seat.  

The headlights are average in area covered and brightness.

With a highway gas mileage of around 30 MPG and a city mileage of around 25 MPG, this car is very easy on gas, compared to some other vehicles available.  In addition, the car does well in crash tests, so it is very cheap to insure.

In conclusion, this car is a great value if you're not a tall person.
