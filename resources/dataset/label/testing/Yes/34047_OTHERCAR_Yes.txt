            When I first started college I had a horrible problem with my cars.  They were all falling apart.  The first one was a Buick.  I loved it in the beginning, being one of the few who love big cars at 18 yrs. old, but as time went on the cost of putting a quart of oil in every other day got crazy.  So I got a Grand Prix.  This one was a nightmare, especially since it was almost as old as I am.  Anyway, I finally said 'no more'.  That's when I started looking.  I wanted something with room, but also something I could get into parking spaces with.  When I first saw my car I thought 'okay, this is cute, but the miles are pretty high.'  After all it had 149,000+, but my dad, who's a mechanic, told me I'd probably get 300k out of it and it was in great condition inside and out.  So I bought it.  
    Well, let me tell you, it is the best used car in the world.  I've had it 2 years and never has it needed any big, expensive repairs.  It drives like a dream and is as powerful as I need, and now that I have a baby it's got plenty of interior room but it's not too big.  The only thing I wish I had done was shop around for an upgraded model, one with power windows and locks, and maybe even cruse control and air bags.  But in all I think this is the best car for someone on a budget who is looking for a reliable, comfortable, family car.  If your looking for something you can have well into the next decade buy Nissan, Sentra's are great!
