            I purchased my Polaroid PDC-640 Digital Camera approximately two weeks ago and I love it.  I purchased it because of the price.  I also purchased it because of the name.  I would not have purchased this camera at that kind of a price if it had not been a name brand.

Polaroid is a name I have always trusted to produce quality products and this is one of them.  It came equipped with a carrying case, ac adapter, batteries, wrist strap, and software.  Everything you need to get started.  This camera is perfect for the beginner.

The only drawbacks I have seen thus far is in the software.  It takes some time to figure out how to get your pictures the way you want and when I used the help feature I did find the answer to my question however I was unable to locate that particular feature in the software that the help file had told me I needed to do.

I do also wish that it had a zoom lens on it but all in all I feel this was a great deal for price.  This is a very easy to use camera for anyone.<br><br>
