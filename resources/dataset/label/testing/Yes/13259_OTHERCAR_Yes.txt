            1999 Honda Accord EX V6

	Like many people, I have high expectation when it comes to Toyota, Honda, or Nissan.  Because they have built such reputation that any thing other than good quality is not norm.  So, when I walked into Honda Accord EX V6 for test drive, I of course had high expectation.

[Dealership Experience]
	I am not sure whether this Honda dealership was just hyper but the sales people were saying stuff about VTEC this and VTEC that.  Obviously, VTEC was very important thing for me to know, other wise they would not have said it so many times.  VTEC has something to do engine where the engine burns efficiently.  VTEC is nothing more than a marketing scheme that�s over hyped.   It�s like a Tommy Jean comes with long-lasting-technology or LLT.  So, Tommy jean is equipped with LLT.  Your toilet paper you just bought has Soft-Bubbling-Technology with Fresh-Feeling-Paper-Absorbsion-Technology, or SBT-FFPAT.  You see what I mean?

[Exterior]
I like way Honda has done with Accord�s exterior.  It�s very sharp and nice.  It reminds me of old Acura Legend.  I like the way front headlamp has edge and shiny.  The new design is bigger and better than older Honda models.  Honda Accord is better looking than Camry or many of its competitors.

[Interior]
Accord�s interior is no non-sense approach.  Every button and dials are simple to operate and straight forward.  There is no search for how-to.  All Honda cars like that.  From its Civics to CR-V, all Honda cars have simple and clean layout that�s pleasing to look at.  Accord also has the climate control, which is nice, too.  The car is very roomy.  

[Engine]
I was encouraged by sale-person to punch the gas.  When I did, the car had slight delay.  I don�t know whether I wasn�t stepping the panel right or what, but it had 1/2 second delay and I thought that was weird.  While I was driving Accord EX V-6 from Rusty Wallies Honda at DFW area, the car was producing smoke.  I was like, what�s wrong?  According to the sales person, all new Honda cars do that.  I was like, �No!  No car and specially the Honda Accord shouldn�t do that at all!�  

Regardless of slight delay the Honda Engine Lag, or the smoking engine, Honda Accord accelerated well.  Maybe those engine lags and smoke from engine department are caused by VTEC working too well.  

[Noise Level]
When I test drive any cars, I concentrate on noise level and any strange noises.  I thought Accord had high road and tire noise level.  I know some of you will disagree but drive the Accord after you driven the Camry or the Maxima.  I am telling you, it�s a lot nosier.  

[Overall]
Overall, Accord is a good car but when you loaded it up, it�s too expensive.  It cost similar to Camry, which can go around $26,000.  I think both Camry XLE V6 and Accord EX V6 have price tag.  I do not know how much reliability counts.  I also don't know whether consumers should pay $5000 extra for Camry and Accord names.  If Honda Accord breaks once every two years and Chevy Lumina breaks three times every two years and Honda Accord cost $5,000 more, I would think I would choose Lumina.  However, Lumina probably isn�t good comparison since Accord is much better car.  I think individual just have to evaluate how much Accord is really worth to them.  Also note that Honda dealership that I have dealt with did not give me pleasant experience.  I also have friends who bought Hondas and did not like the car buying experience and after service experience.  You usually do not get good bargain with Hondas and I was able to negotiate with the dealership, so I did not buy Honda Accord EX V6.
