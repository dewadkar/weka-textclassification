            In a sentence:  I love this car.  As a former VW and Honda enthusiast, I was reticent to fork over around $32K for American iron.  But when my 11-year-old Honda turned 200K+ miles, it happened to be timed with the introduction of the 300M.  And this car caught my eye.  I had two basic things in mind for my new car: Bigger (to feel somewhat safer amongst the myriad SUVs -- a trend that I despise because here in Southern California, it's mostly to do with ego and little to do with off-roading, though owners will tell you otherwise), and more powerful (I'd grown tired of 4-bangers).  The 300M is a wonderful combination of the two.

No, it's not the rear-wheel drive, Hemi V-8 of yesteryear, but it doesn't need to be:  technology and some pretty good engineering has enabled Chrysler to deliver on form, function and amenities for a very reasonable amount of money.

The good stuff:

- This car is a pleasure to drive.  It's very fast, nimble, and extremely comfortable.
- The design is cutting-edge, and the car is easily differentiated from anything else on the road.  It's definitely a &quot;looker,&quot; and it's large enough to accommodate five passengers quite comfortably, yet not so large that you feel like you're parking the Queen Mary.  It *feels* like a well-tamed big car -- heavy, very sure-footed, virtually no understeer or body roll.  In short, very controlled and unbelievably responsive for its size.  The former oxymoron &quot;luxury performance sedan&quot; is truly challenged with the 300M.  This car is absolutely superb on the road and is an even greater pleasure on longer trips even with four adults in the car.
- Climate control: I have trouble outsmarting it.  To quote Ron Popeil and his gimmicky (but excellent) ShowTime BBQ, &quot;just set it and forget it.&quot;  Literally.  Need air?  It kicks on.  Cold?  Heat is delivered to your feet.  And it's smart enough to know that on cold mornings when you crank up the engine, it waits a couple of minutes before the fans kick in so as not to frostbite your sensitive toes.  Conversely, on a sweltering afternoon it wastes no time:  Not only does the AC kick on immediately, but the fans give 100% and the recirculation feature kicks in temporarily to help cool things down.  Give it a few minutes to cool down the interior, and the fan blast mellows to the point needed to keep the requested temperature.  This is a favorite feature of mine, because I don't have to think about it other than setting a temperature.  Crank it up or down just one degree, and you'll feel the difference immediately.  When you stop and appreciate the engineering that went into the system, it's really great.  Don't believe me?  Try managing the system manually, and before long you'll just hit &quot;Auto,&quot; pick a temperature, and let the system do it's thing.
- Transmission is exceptionally smooth and responsive.  Except for hilly terrain where the AutoStick is handy (and quite good), the  transmission is superb and shifts more smoothly than anything I've ever driven.  My father, who's highly critical of jerky transmissions, noted that he couldn't tell when the car shifted except from first to second gear.  Nice touch.
- The 300M doesn't like to sit still.  Freeway onramps suddenly became a rush.  As important as the 253HP are the 255 foot-pounds of torque that become particularly apparent at higher RPM.  The car is relatively quick off the line, but the real fun comes in passing and getting from 65 to, well, something illegal in most states.  Let's just say you're there before you know it.  Even averaging 70+ on the highway you'll get about 26MPG, and overall about 22 -- darn good for an engine of its capacity.
- Excellent brakes.  Firm and very responsive 4-wheel disc.  One of the best things about them is the lack of brake dust; the wheels stay  spotless.
- Amenities a-plenty: A great aspect of this car is the number of amenities that work automatically &quot;behind the scenes.&quot;  You won't be mesmerized by a million lights, bells and alarms.  Understatement is the name of the game here (unlike Pontiac: well-built cars, but you might as well be flying a jetliner).  A few favorites:  Memory seat/mirror/radio presets that adjust themselves when you unlock the door with the key fob (also works for two different drivers), driver's seat that moves away from the wheel when you remove the key (easier ingress/egress), great cupholders that accommodate the largest of 7-11 Big Gulps with ease, fade-to-off interior lighting for an elegant effect, fully automatic headlamps that come on at dusk or when in a parking garage and which stay on for about 90 seconds after shutting off the engine, automatic rear-view mirror dimming that's really effective (how do they do that?), excellent sound system for stock equipment, tilt/retract moon roof, great-looking gauges, trunk release on the driver's side (as opposed to the glove box), handy center console that's hinged on the passenger side (appropriately), and ventilation ducts for the rear seat.

Minor complaints:
- Slight rattle in both the glove box and moon roof that Chrysler hasn't yet been able to really fix.
- Slightly rough idle (in or out of gear), but this I'm told is because the engine is high-performance and as such is designed to operate under a load.
- Slight lurch in the transmission when in first gear, creeping along and subsequently stepping on the gas.
- Plastic door panels aren't quite up to snuff.  Applying hand pressure causes creaking and squeaks.  Disappears or worsens dependent upon the temperature, I've noticed.  You won't break anything doing this; it's just a minor annoyance.
- The cab forward design inherently requires huge sheets of front and rear glass.   Cleaning them from the inside is an ordeal not well-suited for the less agile person.
- Rear view mirror vibration: Since glass makes up so much of the passenger compartment, it also effectively transfers a slight vibration to the glued-on rear view mirror.  Not terribly bothersome, but I expected better for a car in this price range.
- Evidence of very slight body rippling on the &quot;C-posts&quot; behind the rear windows and to the side of the rear glass on both sides.  From certain angles and under certain lighting, the paint has just a slight ripple effect in an area about 4x4&quot;.  I've noted this on virtually every 300M I've had a chance to look at closely, and I trust it's not a flaw that compromises structural rigidity. (Anyone else notice this?)
- Steering wheel needs better adjustment capability.  If I bring the wheel to a setting that's comfortable for my arms, I've partially blocked the instruments.  Since there are very few gauges and a myriad idiot lights, blocking them from view is not a good thing, and adjusting the seats is not an option, either.  A greater number of settings would solve this problem.  Also, the steering wheel is stylistically not befitting of the car; it looks like they cut the budget on this one.  Though leather-wrapped, it's thin leather and doesn't adequately convey the feel.  Also, the interior would be nicely finished if Chrysler would place the 300M emblem in the center and carry a (real) wood theme through part of the wheel.  I realize some of this poses problems for airbags, but other manufacturers do it really well.  So should Chrysler.  Nowhere in the car is the 300M moniker apparent.  Finally, radio controls in the steering wheel would be ideal.

As far as major problems go:  I haven't had any!  No window motor failures, cracked windshields, brake problems, etc., that other reviews I've read have reported.  My 300M is 16 months old and has been driven 23,000 miles.  Nothing negative to say here.

Overall, I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a  better overall value much different than its competition like the Bonneville or the Acura 3.5 TL.  No, the fit and finish aren't quite as good as our Japanese and German competitors, but Chrysler's come a long way in the past ten years, and the 300M's features and performance are weighty considerations.  Will my 300M be as reliable as my Honda over the long haul?  I obviously can't say.  But with the exception of a nickel-sized ding that some jerk put in my left rear quarter panel (can't hold Chrysler liable for that), my 300M still looks almost as good as it did when I drove it off the lot.  And my daily commute is no longer a &quot;commute.&quot;  It's something I look forward to every day.
