            This great little SUV has it all! Decent gas mileage, the good SUV looks and easy to maneuver. If you are content with the 2x4 aspect, there is nothing that will beat this car.  The 2.4L engine has decent power (even though it is not a V6) and handles very easily, unlike some SUV's. 
The interior comes with wood-like trim options giving you that sporty luxury feel. On the road it handles easily like all Japanese cars, has comfortable seats and has plenty leg/head room. This car's standard features are A/C, driver side air bag, passenger-side air bag, Anti-lock brakes, Cruise control, rear window defogger Power locks and mirrors, Power steering, Power windows, AM/FM radio, Cassette, CD player and more. Quite a bit of car for Manufacturer's price of $23,515.  Dealer invoice is $20,928.
