            I bought a '92 Silverado 1500 Series about 2 months ago, for my car lot.  I decided to drive it to lunch one day, and have been driving it as a daily driver every day since that point.  I sincerely enjoy this truck.  The Silverado has more power than it really needs, which is actually nice in traffic, or when towing a trailer, or another vehicle.  The Silverado I bought has 198,000 miles on it, and seems to still have the same driveability and power that it did when it was new.  I had to put a new clutch in it when I bought it (I knew that before I bought it), and I had to get a instrument cluster for it also, the volt gauge was malfunctioning, which caused it to run terrible.  The clutch cost me $318.XX installed, and the instrument cluster, I installed myself, and bought used for $100 from a salvage yard.  I took the cluster to the dealer to have the mileage set accurate.  I consider these VERY minor problems for a vehicle that has almost 200,000 miles.  I went from St. Louis, all the way to Laredo, Texas to get another truck, with this Silverado.  I pulled a 3/4 ton Dodge back from Laredo, Texas with it, and had absolutely no problem at all, and I used a "vehicle dolly" to pull the Dodge, which makes it harder on the vehicle pulling the other.  The Silverado used no oil on the trip, did not over heat once, and I ran the air conditioning the whole way there and back (with the original a/c compressor).  All in all, I would simply recommend this truck to anyone looking for one tough work truck, that will simply not quit for anything.  The 350 V-8 Chevrolet produces is outstanding, and could almost be considered "over-powered" for the 1/2 ton Silverado Trucks.  Now, for the bad part...  The paint on the hood, and the driver's side front fender is flaking, and peeling.  I've found this common on most GM Vehicles, in the years of '88 all the way up to '93.  But, if this is all you have to worry about in a used vehicle, then you're not you're not too bad off.  I simply cannot recommend a more reliable, more powerful truck for the money.  Anyone who is looking for a truck should start with a GMC, or a Chevy.  
I want to thank everyone for reading this, and good luck purchasing your next vehicle, I can only hope it is as enjoyable as my experience has been thus far.
