            I recently bought the 2000 Regal LSE Millenium Edition Regal LS. Our other car is a 1998 Buick Century, which my wife and I both love.

The car had 50,000 miles on it, and felt (feels) brand new. I had been considering the supercharged GS, but had decided that I really did not want to pay for premium gas all the time. The differences between the GS and the 2000 LSE (LSE is only available on the 2000 model. You can get all the options for any year LS, but at a price) is the supercharged engine and the full traction control, which independently controls the four brakes. The traction control on the LS is already superb.

What can I say? From the self-darkening rear-view mirrors, the heated leather seats, and the trip computer that not only tells you gas averages, current gas consumption, and how far you can go on your current gas level, but also tells you when to change the oil, and whether your tires need more air.

The car is built with the same platform and engine used on the Chevy Impala LS. The car is solid, FAST (200 HP with 208  pounds of torque), and super-reliable. The suspension is the Grand Touring suspension (Optional on the LS, standard on the GS), which makes this car not only fun to drive, but achieves the almost impossible balance between feeling the road well, but in excellent comfort and smoothness. I daresay that it would take a car twice the price to get a slightly better ride.

I have back problems. The car takes care of me. Buick seats are legendary, and this one is no exception. The seats come in bench and bucket. I have a Century with the bench and a Regal with the Buckets. Take your pick. These seats will love you and you will love them back. I would not settle for less. I love the 6-way motorized adjustment and the way they give you the lumbar support you need.

Interesting comparison: I recently drove a 2000 Camry belonging to a friend. I was not impressed. I have much more car for the price: 3800 cc engine putting out 200 horsepower, beautiful alloys, heated leather seats that can't be beat, multiple power outlets, six-speaker beautiful sound system (not the Monsoon), a trip computer that is really handy (and tells you how long you have till you need a gas station), tinting mirrors, and a nicer exterior (yes. I am serious). I also have audio controls on my steering wheel, traction control, ABS, front wheel drive, 16-inch wheels, triple air bags, and foldaway rear seats. My parts are cheaper (and GM-generic), any mechanic can do my work, and - Get this - cops rarely, if ever, pull a Buick over.

Now, the interior styling is not the best I have seen. Don't get me wrong, everything is within easy reach, including the  two rear cup holders, but decidedly GM unpretty.

However, if you are a college senior looking for a phat chick magnet, why did you even read this far? Get out of here and let us thirty- and forty-somethings look for a family car with great gas mileage (21 city - up to 35 highway), safety rankings (one of the highest for the year), and hidden, latent power (the car loves to run, and gives a satisfying throaty roar). If you can get used to the so-so interior, you got a deal. I paid 10,500 for mine, which was a GM certified.

Beat that. Camry and Accord: Eat my dust.
