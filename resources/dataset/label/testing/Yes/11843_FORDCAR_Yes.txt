            After my daughter was born, I just knew that I would have to give up my need for speed.  Sports cars and kids just don't mix.  I began my journey for an affordable family car with a little sport, and never dreamed I would find it in the Taurus.  My husband actually convinced me to test drive it, and I loved it.  The back seat is wonderful for car seats.  It is easy to put them in, and easy to remove them.  There is child locks on the doors, and locks for the windows.  The front middle seat pushes down for easy access to the kids, or folds up to reveal a neat little cubby hole for drinks, and any other junk you want to hide.  The best part is that I can still get up and go.  I love knowing that I can still beat those slow pokes at the red lights, and be safe in my Taurus.<br><br>
