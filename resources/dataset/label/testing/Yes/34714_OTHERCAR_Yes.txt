            I have the MPV now for a year, it was a one owner van. I paid $1500 canadian dollars for it last year certified & e-tested with 200k on it.
It's a 4 cyl 2.6l 5 speed manual transmission and 5 seater.
The engine is excellent running & very quiet and have a timing chain. The manual transmission is also smooth shifting except during the winter when it's below freezing mark its a bit hard to shift until engine warms up.
I changed the transmission oil to synthetic gear oil and the shifting is better during winter, of course you got to let engine warms up a bit during cold winter months.
My engine was overheating during summer, I've removed the thermostat and still overheating, I've put a new radiator and the problem solved.
I've tinted the windows, add a bench seat at the back and is now an 8 seater, cost CAN$45 at a local junk yard with all the belts.
I love my MPV and I'm looking for another one to buy but hard to find one with a 5 speed.
I highly recommend an MPV van with a 5 speed.
A 4 cly 2.6 with a timing chain and a 5 speed manual transmission is very reliable.
Automatic transmission for these vans are very expensive stay away from high mileage and 4x4.
