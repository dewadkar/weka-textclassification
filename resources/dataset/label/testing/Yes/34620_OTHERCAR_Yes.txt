            Recently, my 1989 Honda Accord basically failed me completely, with an array of problems compounding each other until it was no longer feasible or practical to try to fix the car. With that I was in the market for a new vehicle. Seeing as though the Honda had served me valiantly for 11 years, with very few problems (until recently), I was leaning towards purchasing another Honda. I was willing to pay for the Honda name in return for quality and was about to go to a local dealer and purchase a Honda when one of my friends pointed me to a subaru dealership nearby. This surprised me, because in my mind, subarus were no comparison to Hondas. Nonetheless, I decided to check it out, and I was not disappointed.

The new, more aggressive, more interesting styling of the 2000 immediately caught my eye, and I took the car for a test drive. Surprisingly, it had very ample power, and a smooth and quiet ride. Because of this, and because the car cost about $4,000 less than I would have paid for a Honda, I decided to purchase the vehicle. Needless to say, I have not been disappointed in the least bit. Since the purchase, my car has had no mechanical problems of any sort, and has always been extremely reliable. The gas mileage is great too, especially with today's extremely high prices. As I mentioned earlier, the designers at Subaru have added some flare to the previously lackluster styling. The car is much more aggressive and modern, and I have no qualms about telling my friends about my subaru, something I would never have even thought of doing before. In fact, since my purchase, several of my friends have also bought the legacy sedan, and have had experiences like mine. 

The bottom line is this: If you're in the market for a dependable, stylish car but want to save a few thousand dollars while not compromising any features you expect to get in a car, the Legacy Sedan is a perfect choice. It combines affordability and quality perfectly in one complete package. <br><br>
