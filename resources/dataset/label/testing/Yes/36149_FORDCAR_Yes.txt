            My son and I were shopping for a car for him.  He's 17.  My son is approximately 6'3&quot; and about 230 lbs.  Not a small person.  So we were checking out larger used cars when a salesman recommended the Ford Focus.  

When we first were looking at it I thought &quot;no way&quot;.  He would never fit in it.  He really liked it.  The Salesman got the keys and Chris got to drive it.  He fit in so perfectly.  You would not believe how much room there is in the front both for legs and height.  I rode in the back seat which was quite nice.  Needless to say he loved it and we now have a Ford Focus in our family.  

I got to drive this car for about a week and was further surprised to find that it was really fun to drive.  I thought it similar to a roller coaster.  It has extremely tight steering and when you step on the gas you go.  No fooling around.  My son and I both love this car.  

Remember I told you my son was 17 so you might think that this is a great car for the younger crowd only.  Not quite.  My mother-in-law just purchased one and she is 72.  She loves it.  Great little car for her to beep-bop around in.  

This great car runs anywhere from $12,000 to $14,000.  NOT expensive at all.  I recommend this car highly for anyone of any age.  You will not regret this purchase. <br><br>
