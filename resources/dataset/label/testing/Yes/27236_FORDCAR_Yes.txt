            *Why did I buy this vehicle*

Since I am living in NYC, anything more than a compact car is very inconvenient (parking or just driving around).  I purchased this car online.  I never test drive nor have a closer look at the car prior to pickup date.  I made my purchase totally based on the reviews I found on the web/magazines.  

*Describe what I love and hate about this vehicle*

There are a lot of things I like about this car.  The exterior is small enough to fit into a small parking space.  The interior is big enough to give you a feeling that you are in a much larger car.  The trunk space is huge.  For a family of 2, this car is definitely big enough to accomplish any given task.  The power produce by the 2.0 liter 4cyl Zetech engine is well enough for city driving.  Unlike most of other cars in this range, you can actually feel the &quot;pull&quot; when you press the gas pedal even with an automatic tranny.  The handling is superb.  The suspension and the small steering wheel make me feel like I am driving a go-kart.  Since I didn't drive the car prior to the pickup date, the exterior styling plays a major factor when I choose this car.  With the new 16-inch wheels option, the car looks even better compares to the 2000 model.

There are few things I dis-like about the car.  First, no automatic sunroof!  I could hardly believe this is a fact since they are marketing this car to Gen-X/younger folks.  Secondly, Ford market this car with a low advertise price of 11000 dollars.  After little research, for 11000 dollars, you get a car with nothing.  You will need to shell out more money for air-con and options which is already standard on most of the cars in arena.  

*Who should buy this vehicle?*
I would suggest this car to anyone who is looking for an exciting car yet wish save part of their paycheck towards a Real Estate and/or such.  Almost everything about this car excess my expectation.  No wonder it received awards year after year of it's release.  It's definitely the best in it's class. <br><br>
