            I bought my 1994 Nissan Maxima in 1998 with very high mileage(111000). I knew that this car would be a solid and reliable performer based of Consumer Reports info and other sources, so don't let higher mileage cars scare you when looking at a Maxima. As soon as I bought the car, I fell in love. It had a beautiful look that I loved and a smooth shifting automatic transmission with electronic overdrive. The interior was more than ample for my large frame, and the ergonomics are excellent, as everything is very easy to reach for. The base model GXE came nicely equipped with a good list of standard features such as: Power windows, power door locks, heated power side-view mirrors, clarion sound sysytem w/factory amp, and keyless entry. Of all the options available I found that the keyless entry, was by far my favorite option because of the added convenience. See, I am one of those people who hates to have their pockets filled with change and car keys, so having a keyless entry system was a god-send. This option is also an excellent feature because never again will you be locked out of your car again. The interior of the car is very comfortable and the adjustability of the seats is another plus. The car is an all around good performer, but could use a touch more power(I'm a speed freak anyways...). The car had 160000 miles on the clock when I sold it, but throughout my whole ownership period I had never had to take the car to the shop for anything mechanical. I also tend to drive my cars hard and the Maxima seemed much more than willing to take any ammount of punishment you were going to throw it's way. I was sad to see this car go but it was getting on in miles and I wanted something a little smaller and quicker with a manual gearbox, so I opted for the Acura Integra GSR. In retrospect I should have kept my Maxima as a second car, to replace the atrocious Ford Probe SE that my fiancee owns..We still may just get another newer Maxima. This car is an excellent value for it's uncompromised reliability and comfort. Nissan scores another victory!
