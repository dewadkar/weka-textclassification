            I purchased an 1999.5 Audi A4 1.8T new last year. I owned a Saab 9000 CSE-T prior, and the only thing it had over the Audi was it's power. I choose the 1.8T so that I can upgrade the computer to take full advantage of the turbo, which I'm in the process of doing now.  It's by far the greatest car that I've owned, and is every bit as enjoyable to drive with 40,000 miles on it as it was when it was new. 

I compared it to the Mercedes C and the BMW 3. The Mercedes didn't come in a 5 speed, so it was out. The BMW was a great car, but as soon as you added in the options the BMW was $6-9K more expensive and there was no all-wheel drive available (they were even charging ~$300 for a fold down rear seat). My car came through with the sunroof, winter package (ski sack, heated seats, heated door lock and headlight washers), Quattro, Bose stereo with CD-changer, sport package, sport seats and trip computer. 

On top of this, the Audi maintenance covers all repairs and maintenance for the first 50,000 miles. I have 41,000 miles and haven't shelled out a dime. I've had an oil change every 5000 miles, and no problems with the car.
