            This is the third best vehicle I have ever driven, second only to a Porsche and a Cadillac. My Safari is a 1998 and I have about 18,000 miles on it already. (I also had two Chevy Astros before this.) It is the best minivan overall (along with its Chevy Astro cousin, which shares its engine) for towing, which means the engine is very very powerful. Acceleration leaves the others in the dust. I have had absolutely no trouble with this rock-solid truck-like minivan. Its truck-based construction indicates that it is for serious enthusiasts, families who do a lot of towing, or people who appreciate its extra eighth seat (found exclusively on GM minivans). If you're looking for a mickey-mouse bargain minivan, don't buy one: This is for the big boys! I bought it because I know a lot about cars and trust the GM name. The cargo space is plentiful. I love its massive horsepower from the Vortec V6 and stunning rallycar looks. I am higher up than most vehicles and feel very safe on the road. (If you're thinking about buying an SUV, think again- the Safari has an All Wheel Drive option, which only lowers fuel economy by 1/2 mpg!) The only thing I regret not doing is opting for the CD player! The only negative attribute of this vehicle is, as with all vans, its cornering isn't good: Try to stay under 40 when you make a turn, as you will feel like you're sliding sideways. Otherwise, relax in the comfortable seats and listen to the premium stereo. You've made a good choice!<br><br>
