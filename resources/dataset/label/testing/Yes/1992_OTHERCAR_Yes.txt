            The body of the car is elegant looking and the wood grain interior on the inside makes the car look classy. I have the pearl white exterior with blond leather interior.  

I just recently discovered that the seats are turning blackish- even on parts where no one is actually sitting - which is strange to me. My car is only 5 months old and well taken care of.

The drive is great- comfortable handling and the heated seats are a nice added benefit.  I never thought I would use them but when you get into the car and it is cold out- the leather is very very cold to sit on.  So I just turn on the heated seats and they heat up very quickly.  I don't find that the overall heating system is that great but it is sufficient.  I haven't used the air conditioner yet so I am not sure how well that works.

The cup holders in the back are a nice touch also and the glove compartment is very roomy.  The trunk has a lot of room and a net so that when you go shopping everything basically stays in place.
