            With a new baby in the family, we find ourselves taking photos nonstop.  We have never been on the cutting edge of technology (didn't get a DVD player 'til our VCR broke last week) so hadn't ever seriously considered a digital camera.  Now that we have so many photo opportunities, and our family near and far want to keep up with our little one as she grows, we thought we'd take the plunge.  

We did a fair amount of homework, talking with experts from the local camera shops and other folks we know, and learning all we could from different web sites.  Then we shopped prices, and finally decided on the Fuji Finepix 2800 from BuyDig.com.  We got the Upgrade Executive Kit which comes with a 64 MB smart media card, lens cleaning kit, and a padded carrying case.

The camera is solidly made and doesn't feel cheap.  It fits well in your hand and has a nice heft.  We wished the lens had an automatic lens cap or cover, instead of the somewhat flimsy plastic cap provided.  

We liked the fact that there are just a few buttons and controls, and the menus are easy to figure out.  After my husband explained the basic features I was using it fluently in just a matter of minutes.  

Here are the specs on the camera, with a few comments:

* 2.11 Mega Pixel CCD (2.0 million effective pixels) with RGB filter
Comment:  You can get lower resolution, and you can get higher resolution.  This is a big driver in camera cost.  More on this later.

* Fujinon optical 6X zoom lens (F2.8/F4.8/F8.8). Equivalent to 38mm to 228 mm on a 35 mm camera
2.5X Digital Zoom
                                
Comment:  Also a big driver in camera cost.  Depends on your needs.               

* Multi-Programmed Flash with Red-Eye Reduction
                                               
* Motion Picture Capture with sound up to 60 second at 10 frames per second

Comment:  This is a fun feature.
                                               
* Voice annotation up to 30 second per picture
  
Comment:  Your kids can say "Hi Grandma" on the photo you email.  
                                             
* Webcam function when using the "Picture Hello" program
                                               
* Automatic plus six white balance selection
                                               
* Built-in TTL electronic viewfinder
                                               
* 1.8-inch LCD Monitor

Comment:  You can use either the viewfinder or the monitor to see your shot before you take it.  The monitor displays your shots or movies after they are captured.

Note that in low-light situations, what you see through the viewfinder is sacrificed in favor of a better picture, so sometimes you are left guessing what the picture will actually look like.
                                               
* 64 zone TTL metering, Programed AE (Exposure Compensation in Manual mode)
                                               
Equivalent to ISO 100
                                               
1/2 to 1/1,500 sec. (combined with mechanical shutter)
                                               
* Product includes 16MB SmartMedia Card, 4-AA size alkaline batteries, Shoulder strap, USB Cable, FineViewer, DP Editor,
AppleQuick time 5.0, Videoimpression, Adobe PhotoDeluxe HE 4.0 for Windows

Comment:  16MB SmartMedia Card is pretty small.  You will probably want a larger card if you will be taking a lot of high-quality images at one time, or plan to use the movie mode.

And now, back to our story...
So we excitedly took the camera out of the box, and my husband spent a fair amount of time reading the manual, working with the software, and experimenting with the camera.  After not too long he had the gist of it, and we began to take photos.  It was so much fun to be able to shoot and shoot, not worrying about "wasting film" or the cost of developing the photos.  Whenever you feel like it you can review the shots you've taken and delete the ones you don't want to keep, releasing room on the media card for new shots.  Transfer your shots to your computer and you can edit them by cropping, changing the color balance, etc.  It's truly addicting - my husband spent hours playing around with the images and emailing them to friends and family.  They looked just beautiful!  We were really excited about the quality of the images and how much money we were now going to save by printing our own photos at home rather than paying for developing and processing.  

Then we decided to print a few.  The photos taken outdoors in bright sunshine looked acceptable.  Next we printed some indoor shots.  That's when the bubble burst.  These were pretty grainy, which really surprised us after seeing such beautiful sharp pictures on the computer screen.  We thought perhaps it was our rather inexpensive printer, so my husband went to the kiosk at the camera shop and made a few printouts there.  While they were better than the ones we made at home, they were not nearly as sharp and crisp as the prints we get from Costco processing.

Now, for those of you who plan to share your photos electronically, this camera will be just fine.  When your friends and family are over at your house, just run the slide show feature on your computer and everyone will enjoy seeing all the great pictures you've taken.  Email pictures to far-away friends and family and they can see them on their own computer.

But if you're like our family, and scrapbooks are an important part of your family tradition, you will probably want to invest in a camera that can produce higher quality print outs.  That means more pixels (and a higher cost).  We are also going to want to frame prints of some of the baby pictures to give as gifts, so of course want the best quality we can get.  

After some serious thought we decided to send the camera back, even though we'd incur a 10% restocking fee and eat the shipping and handling.  We will continue to buy our film at Costco and have them develop and print our photos and make us a CD.  We'll try again when the prices of the higher-end cameras come down.
