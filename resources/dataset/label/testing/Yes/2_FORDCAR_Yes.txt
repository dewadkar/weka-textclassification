            Every weekday, I am a passenger in a <b>1999 Ford Taurus</b> and I feel like I'm in a limosine being chauffered all around town.  I feel this way because this is one of the most comfortable and smoothest cars I've ever been in.

My boss owns a beautiful black 1999 Ford Taurus, and from the first day I saw it I was in awe of this vehicle.  He has a fine looking spoiler on the trunk and the car doesn't look anything like a &quot;family car&quot;, which is what I believe Ford has been pushing all of these years.  

Being that we have to go through traffic that is unreal here in the Atlanta Metro area, I've seen the pickup and performance of this car from experiences on the Interstates here as well as stop and go traffic.  The car immediately responds when asked, shifts smoothly with its automatic transmission and I've never seen the car &quot;not&quot; do what it was supposed to do.

The air conditioning and heating systems in this car are phenomenal.  I have NEVER seen a heater work so fast in a car in my life as I saw this one do this past winter when it was freezing outside.  Now that it is summertime, the air conditioning is getting a major workout, but still the air immediately cools without sending any hot blasts of air into the car.

The seating in the Taurus is just amazing.  We've had five adults in this car with no problem, two in the front and three in the back.  This included having three MEN in the back and they sat rather comfortably as well.  

When I get into this car, I just melt into the seats and relax.  It's a treat for me to know that I am in a vehicle that is going to keep me well protected as well as give me unbelievable comfort.  I can listen to the stereo system which includes the AM/FM radio/cassette/CD and fade off into some kind of fantasyland where I don't have to think about anything especially work.

Many people have stated that the Taurus line has a transmission problem inherit within it.  Since my boss owned a 1989 Taurus before this one, I asked him about that situation.  He told me that in some of the years of the vehicles in the 90s that was true, but that Ford that improved the transmission so that wasn't a problem.

Because of his reassurance, I added the Taurus to my list of possible cars to purchase for myself.  As you will see in future reviews here, I'll describe my experiences with the 2000 Taurus and how that has affected my buying decisions.

However, I absolutely love my boss's car.  I would take it in a second if he gave it to me and I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who wants to look COOL in a 'family' vehicle.<br><br>
