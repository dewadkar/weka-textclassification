            How can you not like the Maxima?  With an outstanding engine, lots of
standard features and Nissan dealers giving huge discounts on the cars,
you can pick up a V6 powered Maxima for around $20k and get alot of 
standard features.  I've had my car for 1.5years now, and I still love it.
I can easily get to illegal speeds with very little effort, add a few
suspension mods and you can take turns at double the posted limits.  The
three suspension neutral mods (won't make the ride harsher) are
  - Front Strut Tower Brace (around $70)
  - Rear Strut Tower Brace (around $70)
  - Rear Sway Bar (around $220)

Those three mods will give boost the standard Maxima handling several
notches and still keep the car very comfy.  Then there is the reliability
factor, I've not yet gone to the shop for anything.  Heck there have been
ZERO recalls since the 4th generation was introduced in 1995.  How many
American cars can even claim half the above items?  If you are looking for
a sedan, check out the Maxima, and you'll never regret that you did
