            I recently obtained my second car, a 1997 Saturn Wagon with 50,000 miles. Now at first, I was hesitant, because the V4 seems like it can't provide the power that you may need. However, I found that the manual transmission can give this peppy V4 all the power that it needs. The interior, while simple, puts everything in easy reach. The optional lumbar support can really help to shorten those three and four hour trips. Doing a lot of lengthy driving for my work, I have put almost 20,000 miles on the car in the past year, bringing the total mileage to just under 70,000. Even with all that mileage, the Saturn SW handles the road like a charm.<br><br>
