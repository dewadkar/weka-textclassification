            The Pontiac Sunfire convertible is a bargain if you want a low budget, low maintenance, great looking convertible that can be driven year round.  Standard front wheel drive and anti-lock brakes make this a very easy car to get around with in the winter.  I've driven mine through two winters with no problems whatsoever.  My last convertible, a Miata, wasn't so easy to live with.

Although both engines give very respectable gas mileage, I recommend the optional 2.4 liter twin cam engine over the standard 2.2 liter engine, which runs out of steam quickly if you have more than one person on board or are running the air conditioner.  The Sunfire's convertible top is hands down the easiest to operate of any convertible I've ever driven.  A handle with a lockout button located above the rear view mirror both raises and lowers the top.  You just push the handle to the side to lock the top down.

The negatives are very minor.  First, it's rather noisy, even for a convertible.  Second, the manual transmission feels a little notchy.  It's not bad but definitely not up to par with most European or Japanese manual shifts.  Third, the standard cassette sound system is a disappointment for GM, which usually puts very good OEM sound systems in its vehicles.  Last, the driver's floor mat has a tendency to occasionally get caught on the clutch pedal, a problem I consider potentially dangerous.

In terms of quality control, the biggest problem I've had with the Sunfire was a coil pack that caused the engine to misfire and was replaced at a cost of $180.  Overall, this car has a few virtues and no really bad vices.
