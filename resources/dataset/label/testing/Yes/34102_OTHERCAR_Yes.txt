            Needing a second/work car, I was forced to look at the &quot;Luxury&quot; line for the sake of comfort of occasional business passengers, but on a small budget! Daunting task, to be sure... but I found success in my 92 Lincoln Continental!

The local &quot;private&quot; dealer, Bavarian Auto Sales in Holly Hill(Dayotna Beach), FL, had a few &quot;nicer, older, luxury cars&quot; on their lot so I stopped by. I chose the 92 over the 94 simply for the sake of money... AND MY FATHER CAME BEHIND ME AND BOUGHT THE 94!

The 92 is very comfortable, I got over 20 mpg in mixed driving, putting over 500 miles on the vehicle in the first week! It handles superbly and I got a good price, $5200 including tag and tax! (If epinions has a place for used car dealers, this dealership gets 5-stars itself!)

If you like comfort and prefer used vehicles, the Lincoln holds up well. Mine has about 90,000 miles and shows no signs of wear. The engine is smooth, the tranny shifts clean. The steering is still relatively tight (although nothing like my 98 Firebird, but THAT's a totally different style car...)

Yeah... I can recommend the 92 Lincoln Continental... and if THIS is an example of their quality, I could recommend ANY Lincoln Continental!<br><br>
