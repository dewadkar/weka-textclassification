            I am in the business of moving Travel Trailers form the manufacturer to the Dealers.  This is very demanding on a vehicle.  I am very pleased with my F-350 Dually diesel It has meet up to all the challenges that has come it's way.  It has plenty of towing power coupled with a comfortable  interior. In my business my truck's engine may run for days at a time (other than me checking the oil every other fuel up ). The E40D ( auto transmission ) shifts a little rough but has been doing a fine job over all.

This has been a wonderful truck on the expressway but is a little hard to get around a down town city environment.  With this machine you don't want to try the drive though banking either,  It can be a little embarrassing  when your to wide and have to get people behind you to back up.  The F-350 is a serious machine for the person that has a serious load to pull or job to do.  I wouldn't recommend this truck to a person for a daily (empty) run around town truck.<br><br>
