            This was my first venture into Digital photography after 20 years of being a staunch believer in SLR only photography.  I have to admit this C750 has made a believer of me in a very short period of time.

It feels great in the hand.   The zoom and shutter buttons feel like they were made for my hand. The menu's are quickly learned and easy to use.  The buttons to operate the options and modes are not too close together like on some of the mini cameras I looked at.  The shooting modes it offers make it incredibly flexible.  The remote control is a fun little add on and the camera is pretty good on batteries.

The 10X optical zoom lens is amazing.  Its the true selling point of this camera.  Forget the cameras that stress digital zoom, high optical zoom is the only way to go to keep high resolution when you're zooming.  The lens quality is very high; clear and pure.

The xD media card is amazingly small for the amount of data it can store.  Its about the size of a $.25 but you can buy them as large as 512 MB.  You only get a 16 MB with the camera so buy an extra larger one.  I highly recommend you also get a USB reader for this card to speed up your uploads and save battery drain.

The strap is not the greatest as it cuts into your skin after several hours of wearing (I've never liked the supplied thin strap with any camera I've bought and always have a nice wide padded one). The lens cover feels a bit loose.  

You have to buy a lens tube to add to the camera if you want to use any filters or add on lenses of any type because of the way the lens comes forward from its housing when the camera is powered up.   I bought the CLA-4 from Olympus as my lens tube which gives you a 55mm diameter thread to add lens attachments.  I'd recommend buying this tube and a 1A skylight or UV filter and matching cap to protect the lens of the C750 from scratches.  My dealer didn't tell me about this and I had to figure it out on my own.   Buy them at the same time you get the camera.  

View finder (being electronic and not optical) is hard to use in low light but for $500 its hard to expect everything.   I'll likely try and find a much less expensive camera with only 3x optical zoom and 2 mega pixels with a glass viewfinder for low light photography.  I've rarely needed big zoom capacity in low light (flash needed) situations anyways.  Maybe others do, and if so this may be a deal buster for you.  Shutter lag took some getting used to for me given my SLR/film background but it's pretty good once you get used to it.   I've seen people with much slower shutters on cameras costing more.

The movie mode with sound is awesome.  Little snipets of my kids are great to send to grandparents.  I heard earlier versions of this camera had no sound. Why even have video if there is no sound ??  I'm glad they added into the C750.

Bottom line, its a great camera.  You won't regret it.  Quick and easy to learn.  While I'll never give up SLR35mm photography as part of my hobby, this C750 is sure going to be in my hands a lot.
