            I bought my 1500 quad cab in 1997, after being a solid Ford man for ever I was convinced to try a Dodge by a friend who has had good luck with Dodges as long as I can remember. Well I can tell you this my Dodge is the best truck I have ever owned I have 78,000 miles on it and only changed ,oil ,spark plugs and filters on it. It gives a very comfortable ride and has never balked at any load I have put in it

It is equipped with 5.2 engine and standard transmission and anti-spin rear axle. I traveled a lot the first year I owned it and never needed snow tires on it ,it plowed through 18&quot; of snow like it wasn't there,I carried about 300lb of sand over the rear axle and that was all that was needed.

It is a vehicle that any body who needs to carry a lite load(no more than 3/4 ton)is well suited for and around town every day as well as a long trip.<br><br>
