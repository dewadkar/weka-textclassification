            I've had the Olympus E-10 for 9 months now. I upgraded from an Olympus 340R, which was also wonderful..I waited to do a review till I was very certain of how well I liked this camera.  All I can say is its wonderful!

The Picture quality is amazing! Clear, bright, wonderful colors.. The zoom is great, I have 3 kids, and let me tell you it makes life so much easier to be able to zoom in on them from a distance to get some good shots.  

The only bad thing I can say it that the auto focus is a bit week in low lighting shots.

The feel of the camera is that of a 35mm. It is very comfortable to hold, and light weight. 

I use Olympus B-01E type rechargeable batteries, and the seem to last for about 150 shots or so. I have tried the LB-01 CR-V3 Lithium Battery, which did seem to last a bit longer, but for now the rechargeable seem to be the better bet, they cost a bit less for total uses.

Overall I would have to say that the picture quality from the E-10 is superb. People who see my pictures...printed on the Olympus P-400 Printer..can't believe they are from a digital camera and printed at home! I have had some printed by professional photo printing places just to see the difference, and they look wonderful too.  You can enlarge to 8x10 with no problem. They are crystal clear. 

Prices have come down in the past 9 months, and if your thinking of switching to a digital camera, but think you will miss the feel of a 35mm, this is the camera for you! 

I also have to comment on one more thing, then I'll leave you with some features as listed by the Olympus Site.  If your like me and love to take pictures, but had a bad habit of putting the rolls of film on a shelf, for months at a time. You will love the fact that you can shoot, and see what you have right away.  And if you don't like it, just erase it, no more boxes of photos that you really didn't want. No more doubles of photos you never really wanted in the first place. If you like a picture, and want to share it you print just that picture how ever many times you like, (1 for the grandma's 1 for grandpa, one for aunt May). You get the idea.
