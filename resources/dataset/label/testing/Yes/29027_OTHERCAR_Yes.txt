            After 13 years of driving the same Honda Prelude, I began to look for a new car.  (It's not because the Prelude was ready to give up the ghost.  I just needed a change.  But that's another epinion.)

When the CRV came out, I thought it was really cute.  I read opinions on Car &amp; Driver and Edmunds.com and came away with the impression that it's a pretty good SUV with no really bad features.  And it has a picnic table.  (I bring this up because it's the first thing mentioned to me after someone learns I have a CRV.  Not because it's important to ME.)

Anyway, I test drove the CRV and came away thinking it drove really well...like a car instead of a truck!  A definite bonus.  And since I was coming from the Prelude, I had certain spoiled expectations like tight steering and the compact body size.  Although it doesn't drive EXACTLY like a sports car, it does handle nicely...AND it's a Honda.  (Do I sound biased?)

I wanted the Special Edition (SE) with leather seats and all the options but didn't like any of the three color choices.  So I ended up purchasing a Silver EX and adding leather seats.

The only thing I would have added on retrospect is the optional front passenger arm rest.  I cannot believe it's not a standard feature, but in the week I've owned this car, this is the only thing I can think of to really complain about.  My passengers have assured me it's fine for around town but would be nice for long trips.

Bottom line, this car is wonderful.  I can't rave about it enough.  It handles great, looks sharp and gets respectable mileage.  The room inside is amazing.  No matter how tall someone is, I think they could easily sit in the front seats without feeling crowded.
