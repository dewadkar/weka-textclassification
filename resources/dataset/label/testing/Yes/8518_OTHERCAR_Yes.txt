            After years as a loyal Ford owner, I have to say that Dodge has Ford beat hands down when it comes to full size trucks. I just recently purchased a 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT 2WD Quad Cab.After much shopping around and comparing different trucks, I found that for a reasonable price you get a lot of truck when you buy a Dodge Ram. This truck is huge! The interior is nice and comfortable with a roomy back seat. The suicide doors on both sides were one of my favorite features. The ride is smooth and quiet, but the power is there undoubtably. Every thing is within reach, so there is no need to stretch in order to reach something. The dash is laid out nicely and is very user friendly. Gas mileage is good under normal driving conditions. I also could'nt believe the size of the console between the seats. I can fit my laptop computer in there. Can you believe that! I would recommend this truck to anyone that is in the market to purchase a full size truck. I am very happy with my purchase. Sorry Ford but Dodge has you beat this time.<br><br>
