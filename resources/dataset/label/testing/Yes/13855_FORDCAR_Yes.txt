            PREFACE: I own a 1998 Ford Contour SVT, with approx. 25,000 miles. I live in New Orleans, LA, and I my driving habits consist of both city and highway miles. I purchased the car new.

Let me begin by saying: I love this car!

When I was looking for a new car, I wanted a quick, good handling sports sedan. There were a couple that came to mind: Nissan Maxima and BMW 325. But unfortunately, after adding all the goodies, both were a little (or a lot) out of my price range. But then a friend of mine mentioned the SVT Contour. I had read a little about them, but I didn't expect too much. But that all changed after I test drove one.

What I love about this car:
Probably the best thing about this car is the handling. The SVT is very light on its feet with a quick turn in. The Goodyear GS-C tires grip very well, but are a little noisy on the highway. There is very little body roll, and the side-to-side transitions are smooth. All this, and it is very comfortable on the highway. Let me sum it up by saying that I run out of nerve before this car runs out of grip!

Next is the engine. And oh what a beautiful engine it is! Ford did quite a bit of massaging on this engine, and it shows the instant you turn the key. The exhaust note is one of the sweetest sounds I have ever heard! It has 195 hp, with a top speed of 143 mph. The official Ford 0-60 time is 7.9 seconds, but there have been many tests quoting times in the low 7s. The engine really comes alive after 4000 rpm, and doesn't quit pulling until you hit the rev limiter at 7000 rpms. And even in the horrible New Orleans heat, the engine temperature never moves past normal, thanks to the larger radiator and oil cooler.

What I dislike about this car:
Rattles. I hate 'em. And unfortunately, there have been several to show up. Most of them are in the dash and console. The leather seats also tend to creak, but a leather conditioner helps.

I have also had some problems with the car. At about 23k miles, I took the car in for a long list of annoyances. Driver's window didn't work, ABS light was on, the rattles mentioned above, and 2 recalls. All of these were taken care of under warranty, but there is still the annoyance of having to deal with the dealer. 

So, overall, it is an excellent sports sedan, especially for the price.
