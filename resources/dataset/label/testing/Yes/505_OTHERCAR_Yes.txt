            The Pontiac Bonneville is an excellent car.  Definitely a smoother than smooth ride, this car has a lot of power when you need to get up and go, and yet is roomy enough for a family of five with no problems.  The tilt steering wheel is one of the best features on a car (for me) as I need to be able to move it up and out of the way of my tummy,  but is convenient for those also who prefer to drive with it lower than the usual position of a fixed wheel.  This is definitely a luxury car in a mid-price range, with electric windows and door locks, nice stereo (if it's not loud enough you can always add more speakers!)  It cranks up pretty well though to my mind.  

For those who smoke, there are ash trays built into each door and a ciggie lighter.  The upholstery is fabric and really comfortable.  The front are split bench seats with a fold-down arm rest.  The back seat is large enough for three people to enjoy the ride also, without feeling they are being squashed.

The boot/trunk is pretty roomy - plenty of space for suitcases for vacations, packing up to go to the beach or for the tool kit and storing fleamarket treasures.  As hubby said, "big enough to hide a body in".  Now, I'm just left wondering on that one - whose body is he thinking of?

Ours is a 1994, and cost $8071 secondhand but including a one year service contract, which we thought was pretty good for a car of this calibre.  This is about our best car buy to date.  We hope it'll give us a few years of service, if we look after it right.

I'd say, if you're looking at used cars and they have a Pontiac Bonneville there, give it a test drive and see how it feels.  You'll soon know if it's the right car for you.
