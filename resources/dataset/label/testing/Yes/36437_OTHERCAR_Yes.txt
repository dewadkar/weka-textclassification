            In my younger day&#146s&#133.driving a cool car was a must. But something happened to me over the years. I got a little older, more bills, wiser, married, kids, a lot of bills, house, more bills you get the idea cause I&#146m sure most of you are there too.

 Somewhere over the years I quit caring about the image and just wanted good transportation to get me back & forth to work. So I end up going from 21 years old & driving a 1979 Trans Am with t-tops (what a fun car) to 33 years old & driving this 1987 Dodge Diplomat.

Now let me explain why&#133.

About 1988 &#150 91, I worked at a dealer ship reconditioning cars on the used car lot. It wasn&#146t a glamorous job but I did end up learning a lot about all kinds of cars. Especially used cars & which ones actually ran worth a hoot after people would abuse them & trade them in for whatever reason. It did happen to be a Dodge dealer-ship so I was familure with the Dodge Diplomat. Remembering they were well built cars with a great Dodge v-8 (318) engine in it. Hey at that time our police force was using these cars, so they must have been reliable right?

In short my wife & I around 97 was leasing a Dodge Neon. It was brand new & we had nothing but problems with it. Being totally dissatisfied with it we got out of that lease and up-graded to a Dodge Stratus. Once again we had nothing but problems with that one too. Both these NEW cars spent more time at the dealership repair shop that on the road.  So we go back to dealership and demand that we want out of the lease, didn&#146t care of the penalties, and wanted put into any car that would run.

So they have this 1987 Dodge Diplomat sitting there, just traded in from some little old lady with only 50,000 miles on it. Now I instantly remembered these cars being reliable from working there and also my 90-year-old great-grandmother drove a Chrysler New Yorker the same year, which was basically the same exact car. So we took it and boy am I glad we did.

Let me continue by telling you this is one of the best, most reliable, matinence free cars that my wife or I have ever owned. In-fact I can&#146t believe it&#146s made by Dodge, it must have secretly been made by Toyota or Honda or something because in the past three years we have hardly had to do squat to this car. 

It starts everyday! And let me say in Indiana that&#146s something because we have had some bad winters the last couple of years. And with snow piled on top of it about 0-degs outside this car starts every time! Even new cars have trouble in this kind of weather.

*Features*
This car is loaded. 

-Plush comfortable seats and interior
-AM/FM cassette
-Power brakes, steering, door locks, windows.
-Tilt wheel
-Cruise control
-Air
-Rear Defogger

*The Ride*
  
The Diplomat drives like an expensive luxury car. When I was growing up my parents had a new Lincoln Continental (78/79) & a Cadillac Deville (85/86) and this car rides & drives much like those cars did.

*GAS*

Considering this car has a V-8 Dodge 318 engine it doesn&#146t do too bad. I think it&#146s rated at 18-mpg city & 21mpg highway, but I&#146m sure I&#146m getting better than that. What helps is the car is only equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor instead of a 4-barrel so this does help. Also if you drive like a little old lady from Pasadena it does fine on the gas.  Although gas prices are $1.66 here in Northern Indiana. Ugh how can they get away with this, opps that another topic?

*Other Pluses*

-This car is cheep to insure
-Title & Plates are cheep ($25 for plates)

*Down side*

-The trunk is kind of small. Actually the rear end is smaller that the front end in length. So having that big 318 up front causes the car to be &#147front end heavy.&#148 And that&#146s not good in Indiana snow! You loose traction and the car starts fish tailing. So by putting about 100 pounds of rock salt in the trunk solves this problem. But then you have no trunk space left to put your Christmas presents. 

-No Police lights!

*Closing comments*

Sure this car is a less glorified version of the New Yorker, and basically a glorified version of a police car, but it&#146s so darn dependable. If you have young teen-agers they may not want to be dropped off in it,
in front of their friends either. But don&#146t let that detour you, they&#146ll deal with it. It will help build character!

So while your waiting at the dealership for your brand new $50,000 Mercedes to be fixed, give me a call I&#146ll come pick you up in luxury Diplomat!
