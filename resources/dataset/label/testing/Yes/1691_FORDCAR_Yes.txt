            It's the biggest and baddest of the new crop of SUV's. I was driving SUV's when they were just 4x4 Utility Vehicles. Because of it's size, the new Excursion should be the safest SUV on the road, pratically guaranteed to bulldoze anything in it's path except a county dump truck. Because of it's size (bulk) the Excursion s the ideal transportation for all the soccer mom's and dad's to haul the little ones to and from the games on Saturday and handle all the other domestic chores that need doing any day of the week. There is enough room inside to haul a small horse or several bales of hay behind the third seat when all seats are up and up to nine passenges too. It's not pretty and sleek but has a manly (read brute) appearance and really is nothing but a dressed up heavy duty light truck with softer suspension. I have an older GMC Surburan that I plan to replace with an Excursion, just as soon as the diesel powered version is released. The only downside I found for me is the gas milage (that's why I'm going diesel) and the modifications that I will have to be made to the driveline so I can tow it behind my motorhome.<br><br>
