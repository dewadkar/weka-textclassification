            Recently during a Las Vegas vacation I had the pleasure of driving a Ford Focus rental car.  Ford Motor Company has finally gotten their act together.  Having owned Hondas for 15 years and now a GM product (which I'm not too happy with, but that�s another story), I was very impressed with the Focus.

The first time I saw a Focus, I wasn�t too crazy about the styling, but the too-tall jelly bean shape kind of grows on you.  I especially like the 2-door hatchback model.  The car I had in Vegas was a 4 door, automatic with power everything.  But even the 4-door model gets �looks�.

The 4-cylinder engine (110 HP) had plenty of zip even with the air conditioning on.  The only time the power faltered was when climbing up a pretty steep mountainside with the air on.  Other than that, this car had enough power to zip in and out of traffic whenever needed.

Mileage was good � during the short time I had the car it averaged 30 MPG.  This was great considering the fact the air conditioning was always being used (it was 104 degrees in Vegas), and a lot of the time I was sitting in traffic on the Strip.

Handling was very responsive and there was very little body lean when turning corners.  This car reminded me a lot of my old Honda CRX.  The Focus had a very tight turning radius and could easily be maneuvered in tight spots.  Part of this was probably due to the fact this car had P205 x 15 x 60 tires.

Everything on the dashboard was in a convenient position for the driver.  One feature I really liked was the moment the car was put in �drive�, all the doors locked automatically.  The seat belts were very comfortable to wear for a short driver (I�m 5 foot 3 inches) � they didn�t rub my neck raw.

Trunk space was very good for a compact car.  It held 3 pieces of luggage and several shopping bags with room to spare.  The front seats could use a little more padding for long trips.  The back seat can hold 3 short passengers comfortably.

I�m ready to order a bright shiny red one.
