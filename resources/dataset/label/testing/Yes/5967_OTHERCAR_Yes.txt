            The 1994 del sol gives me a good controlable feeling when i open it on curvy roads.  The sound system is acceptable but for those who like to feel punch, may want to upgrade the sound system. I'm 5' 9&quot;  230 lbs.<br>and seat comfortably, just. I don't recommend this car for a much if any larger person. A place to put a refreshment would be a plus.<br><br>This car has very steady power up most any grade. The four wheel disc brakes makes for even braking and they're easy to change if your one of those back yard mechanics. Just remember, turn the calipers,  don't depress. Oil changes are a breeze as well. <br><br>Keep high quality,low profile tires on this baby; this car will break from the road at higher speeds and spin free. Not the best in the snow either.<br><br>The only real bad thing i can say is that there are  large blind spots, each over either of your shoulder. This car also has it's rattles here and there,<br>but nothing that makes me regret having it.<br><br>Oh God, how could i forget! Driving with the roof off, stored in the trunk, and room left over; is a worthy feeling.  You'll be hooked!<br><br><br>
