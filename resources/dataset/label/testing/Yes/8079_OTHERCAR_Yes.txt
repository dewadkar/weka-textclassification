            Five years and 100,000 miles, my Safari is still keeping on.  The big, goofy van is a mammoth compared to other minivans, but that is what I like about it.  In fact, it has more interior room than my neighbor's Suburban, but his truck rides a lot better.

The Safari has always been a vehicle of compromises.   It has more room than a Suburban, but doesn't ride as nice.  It is less costly than a Caravan, but not nearly as state of the art.  My Safari is equipped to tow up to 5500 lbs, but I wouldn't feel confident to tow anything over 3000 lbs, for fearing of breaking something.

My relationship with the Safari started when I bought it new in Fremont, CA.  I traded in my Honda because I needed a vehicle to tow my newly purchased tent trailer.  What originally impressed me was the style (I like the custom vans of the 70's), maneuverability, (compared to a full size van), and no way I was going to pay $30K for a new 4X4 Blazer (my wife's initial pick of tow vehicles).  The optional rear air-conditioning is what swayed my wife's opinion to my side.  This was my first American made vehicle I have ever purchased. I have previously owned a Honda Civic, Mitsubishi pick up, and Toyota pick up.  Each of which I put 100,000 miles on and traded in for a new vehicle.

Life in California was grand with the big van.  We went on countless camping trips with the tent trailer, as far as the state of Washington, the Sierras, and California's mid-coast.  Though I never used it for commuting (motorcycles rule for that), the first 20K miles went by with a nary a hitch.  Everything worked flawlessly.

Then I got orders to Maine.

I loaded my van up to the ceiling with stuff, hooked up my tent trailer, and off we went.  We arrived in Maine in Nov. 98.  With not a lot of snow driving experience, I was a little nervous about driving a 2wd vehicle with no limited slip differential.  I found out something though.  Yes, you can drive a non-four-wheel drive vehicle in the snow.  In fact, the Safari does quite well.  4500lbs equally distributed over the wheels works well.  BF Goodrich T/A radials work well here too.  Granted, I was never off roading in the Allagash, but I always made it work and Shop and Save when I had too.  And if the snow was too bad, wait 30 minutes till the snow plow guys clear the road.  Maine is one state that is on top of snow removal.  

Winter weather and frost heaved/gravel roads took a toll on the van.  A loose snow chain took a chunk of molding off rear left quarter panel (Donner Pass, CA. actually).  The windshield took lots of chips and pits from flying rocks and sand.  So did the paint.  Little dings arouse all around the body from wayward shopping carts, other people's car doors, falling tree branches, and so forth.  My wife even dropped my motorcycle onto the front fender, making a nice little dent.  The inside took abuse too, with two kids and all their spills and maladies, trash runs to the dump (no trash service where I live in Maine), snow, mud, rain, and various furniture and other items I moved into and out of the new house.  Overall, the van took all the abuse in stride, with very little rust to show for all the new scratches it received.

The frost heaved roads were murder on us though.  My wife hated going down the road in the van, and let me know it every chance she got.  The kids loved all the bouncing and swaying the van was doing.  I replaced the shocks with Monroe Sensatracs gas in the front and Monroe Load Levelers in the rear.  That helped a bit, but still far from smooth.  Now my wife doesn't complain about it much, but maybe she just accepts the lousy roads in Maine. I swear by the Load Levelers.  That is one mod I should have done that from the beginning.  

Along with the harsher conditions, came some interesting mechanical problems.  On hot, humid days, the transmission would start to shift from first to second with a jolt (like a swift kick actually). I found out I could easily remedy this problem by turning off the ignition when I came to a stop light and count "one potato, two potato, three."  Once I turned the vehicle back on it would shift smoothly.   This usually occurs when the van was driven for about an hour or so.  On warmer days, this occurs more frequently.  On cold days, it doesnï¿½t happen at all. I've talk to some transmission specialists in Portland, and their guess was that it was a computer fault in the transmission that occurs when it is hot, and it resets itself when you kill power to the ignition.  Another guess from an auto parts store guy was that I needed a whole new transmission, just like the one he rebuilt in his Chevy Silverado.  The guess I liked best was from the service manager at GMC. He suggested that I needed new transmission fluid.  So I replaced the fluid last January. The van ran great until it warmed up in June.  Hmmm. The service manger's second guess is that I needed to replace a service valve in the transmission. The transmission builds pressure to shift at higher road speeds.  If the valve sticks when I come to a stop, it will shift at a higher pressure between first and second gear, thus causing the jolt.  I haven't replaced the valve yet, since I have other problems with the Safari to deal with at the moment, and Maine summers only last about two months anyway.  

Another problem that was more apparent to us inside the van was the lack of freon in the A/C. I discovered this on a trip to Disney World last November.  I had the air conditioning serviced in January when we got back.  I learned a valuable lesson then: Never have your A/C serviced in 10 degree temperatures.  It might have worked when I drove off the lot that day, but there is no way I could tell.  I did discover that it still didn't work in June.  I went back to the dealer to get a $450 a/c coolent hose replaced.  Ouch!!  It is expensive to be cool.

Those are my two biggest complaints I have with the van.  Another complaint I have is that a "Service Engine Soon" light comes on frequently.  I replaced an oxygen sensor, but the light still comes on.  I brought the van back to GMC, and the mechanic reset the computer so it would ignore a fault code when the catalytic converter doesn't warm up in the required time.  That worked for a while, but now the light still comes on infrequently.  It doesn't affect the performance of the van, so I'll take it back when I have more money to throw away. 

More nit picks that I have had with the van: 
A light that went out in the instrument cluster and was expensive to replace.
A side door handle that would not release the door when it was fully open from the outside. 
An oil leak, an idler arm out of tolerance, and rear brake pads my dealer loves to replace.  Also, the driver side window motor died, and the wipers needed a computer chip to keep functioning.  Overall, I've shelled out a lot of cash to keep this beast running.  Compared to my other vehicles, the Safari is a maintenance nightmare.  None of my other vehicles required anything other than routine maintenance.

Thankfully, I still like the van; otherwise I wouldn't have spent the money.  The Safari is a niche vehicle.  It is the only mid size van left on the market.  Though cheaper than its mini-van rivals, it gets my vote because it tows a lot, has a lot of room, and drives better than a full size van.  I wish the people at GMC who slapped it together during production, would have care for it as much I do.  So in that sense, I feel left down.
