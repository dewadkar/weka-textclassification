            &quot;I'm sick to death of these road monsters blocking my view, riding my bumper, and sucking up enough fossil fuels in a week to heat a small Siberian city for a year!&quot; If I've heard (or read) this statement once, I've heard it a million times, and I'm getting a bit tired of it.

I too have owned economy cars, sports cars, and a small pickup. Every one of those vehicles, without exception, was totaled by some mouth-breather driving a salesmen's commuter special, while eating a grande' burrito, holding court on his/her cell phone, changing radio stations, and reading the newspaper. In spite of maneuvering my little car like a mouse through a cat convention...these drivers would run me off the road, run me over, or simply plow into me. After my last hospitalization, I decided that I would buy the biggest chunk of drivable, solid steel I could find.

In '94 I purchased a Trooper LS with all the bells and whistles, and now I dare other drivers to hit me. Even here in California, rarely does anyone cut me off or try to run me out of my lane anymore. Once...and only once in the past 6 years has someone rear-ended me...with their  spanking new Camaro. He slightly scratched my bumper. Unfortunately for him, he blew his airbag and did about $4000 damage to his front end. Had I not looked in my rearview mirror...I doubt I would have even known I'd been hit.

Except for oil changes and fluid refills, my Trooper has never spent a day in the shop. It has never been garaged, yet the paint is as deep and shiny as the day I bought it. I can't imagine why I would ever need a new vehicle. This one is indestructible.<br><br>
