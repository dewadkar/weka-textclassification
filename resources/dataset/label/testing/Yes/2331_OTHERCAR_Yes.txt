            I am a photographer who bought a Toshiba PDR-M4 back in July, 2000, after a friend of mine recommended I consider a digital camera.  I was skeptical at first, because how could a camera without film really match the quality of standard 35mm photography?  I was about to be proven wrong.
When I first took the PDR-M4 out of the box,  I said to myself,  &quot;What the ..?&quot;  The camera is about the size of a small cell-phone and has the feel of steel.  I first plugged the camera into the AC power, since I needed to let the battery charge;  the PDR-M4 only requires one unique battery which is supplied with the camera.  After the camera was charged, I began to play around with the functions.  One of the best features of this camera is the 8MB buffer built into the camera which speeds up the load time of images; the smart media card memory function is also convenient because of its size.  The PDR-M4 allows for different shooting styles, including adjustment of the shutter speed.  The quality of the picture can also be adjusted in the camera, and users can also choose from 6 compression methods (1600x1200 res divided 3 ways/800x600 divided 3 ways).  Another plus of the PDR-M4 is the selector knob on the top camera that takes you to each of the functions, it is easy to see and operate.  Users can also make adjustments to the flash settings.
The controls are laid out well on the back of this unit, and the display button is convenient since it allows you to cut off the LCD display when you want to save battery life.  The battery itself lasts for about 2 hours between charges.  
When you want to transfer images to your PC, it could not get any simpler.  You just plug into the USB jack on the camera and hookup to your computer.
The PDR-M4 also comes with its own photo editing software that is fun to use.
This camera should not be a replacement for a professional but definitely a camera to consider if you are looking for something you can point and shoot with,  especially for those moments in life you wish you had a camera for.  If you are looking for a fun digital camera to use, the Toshiba PDR-M4 is definitely the one to consider.   <br><br>
