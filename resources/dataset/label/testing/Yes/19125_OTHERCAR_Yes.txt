            I recently had the pleasure of renting one of these dream cars. I fell in love with it immediately. I have to say that this car would be a good buy for just about anybody...except off road junkies. 

When I first got in the car, I was impressed by the comfort of the seating. It was very adjustable and I had no problems figuring out how it worked. The next thing I noticed was that the steering wheel was comfortable to hold. Not too hard, but not too soft either. To tell the truth, I felt like Goldie Locks finding the right things in order.

I noticed that anything that needed adjusting was easy to adjust and everything was easy to reach. There were very little to no blind spots while driving. The car was very well covered with the mirrors and the window space. Also, the electronics of the car were easy to read and very helpful. Like the feature that shows you your miles per gallon, and how much further you can drive without running out of gas. Excellent!

Not only was the car very comfortable inside and easy to drive, but it was a good looking car on the outside. Very nice lines and also a nice look to the body itself. Quality metal used on these cars.

This car is a great buy I thought...so I bought one. I'm so satisfied with my car that I tell my friends about it! This car is worth the money and more!<br><br>
