            We have a 1999 Chevy Malibu.  It has a nice smooth ride and it has the pick up when you need it.  The front seats are comfortable and all of the knobs on dashboard are easy to reach.  The backseat is cramped and not really comfortable for any long range trips,for teens or adults.  One of my peeves in this car is the gas tank.  It is very small 10 -12 gallons. So it seems you always at the gas station.  If you don't travel often and want a inexpensive compact car, you may like the Chevy Malibu. <br><br>
