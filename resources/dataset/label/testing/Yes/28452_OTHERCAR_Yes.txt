            We bought our 2000 Avalon in Dec '99 and absolutely love it.  We were diehard Chevy owners, but I can't imagine buying another Chevy after owning this Avalon.  The ride is amazingly comfortable &amp; quiet and the stereo is incredible.  A built-in 6-CD changer where you feed each CD directly into the radio - no cartridges, no bulky device in the trunk - just load 'em in and play.

For a quiet, comfortable ride in a spacious sedan with tons of trunk space - you can't go wrong with the Avalon.

We also seriously considered the Chrysler LHS, 300M, &amp; Sebring - the .9% financing is tempting, but we liked the Avalon too much.  The Avalon has also gotten great reviews in all the major consumer mags.<br><br>
