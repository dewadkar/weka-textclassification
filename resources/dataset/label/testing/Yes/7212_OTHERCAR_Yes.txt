            I recently purchased a 1999 Laser Red Mercury Cougar.  The first time that   I set foot inside the new Cougar I knew that this was the perfect car for me.  The radical new design of the Cougar is a major step forward in the aging Mercury line up.

One of the first things that you will notice about the Cougar the headlights.  These &quot;bug eye&quot; yet sleek headlights give the Cougar a very unique look.  Once stepping inside the Cougar you will notice that the bucket seats are very comfortable and seem to &quot;suck&quot; you in.  All the gages and controls are placed with convenience in mind.  The only gripe I have on this aspect is that access to the stereo controls is somewhat hindered by the gear shift, but this is only a problem if the gear shift is in PARK.  There also is a convenient cup holder directly below the gear shift.  The cup holder is a little flimsy but not too bad.  The gauges are well placed and easily readable. Another unique aspect of the Cougar is the rear bucket seats.  Passengers have told me that the rear seats are comfortable but difficult to get out of.  Also the rear seats are not convenient for taller people (6'1&quot; or taller).  Another small detail that I have noticed is that the blind spots of the Cougar are larger then normal.  Finally, the engine is top notch.  My Cougar is a V-6 automatic.  I test drove a V-6 manual but chose the automatic due to what was available on the lot.  The V-6 manual out performs the automatic a little, but the difference is not overwhelming.  The V-6 has good to above average power. The handling is outstanding.  I have no complaints on the engine performance of the Cougar.

Overall the Cougar is a fun car to drive.  The sporty look is backed up by its performance and handling.  <br><br>
