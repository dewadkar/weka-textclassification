            While this car looks sharp, and rides nicely, there are still a few
things wrong that I think need to be corrected.

First the positive:  I have the 1999 SE model loaded with sunroof, power
everything, side impact bags, leather interior.  It looks great!  I drove
a Nissan Pathfinder before this and liked that but felt it was time to
get out of the SUV and go for a sporty passenger (4 door) car. The ride
is smooth.

Here's what I don't like:  The car is poor on gas mileage, especially
around town.  It gave me a hard time starting and sounded rough - like
it was going to choke and stop.  I bought it to my dealer and he recommended upping my gas from 87 to 89.. okay that helped.  The
ride is smooth but the seats are NOT comfortable. I have moved the
electric seats every which way, but there is no lumbar control and your
back hurts after driving for an hour - and I don't have a bad back.

Right now we are trying to discover why the rear wheels make a groaning
sound on certain days in very slow speeds.  We are still working on that one and will have it checked out the next time we go to the dealer.

For the price, I expected a bit more.  Oh, and PS, the pass through in
the back is kind of useless.. prefer a fold down back seat.
