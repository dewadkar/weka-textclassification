            I bought this car in Nov. 97 and it had 44K miles on it.  It is now 35 months later and I have added 46k miles which totals 90k.  Over the past 3 years I have had a few problems with the vehicle.  However, none of them seem to be out of the ordinary or excessive for a vehicle of this age and mileage.  The driver's side power window motor broke.  And the motor mounts went bad.  The total for this maintenance was about $500.  Not bad for a car that is paid off and should run for another 100k miles.  Another bad thing is that the paint is fading.  I live in FL so the sun can be pretty harsh on vehicles and I didn't own the car for the first 44k miles so I don't know how well the car was washed and waxed before I owned it.  But, it does seem that the &quot;Toyota Red&quot; doesn't fare well in FL.  I have seen many early 90's Toyota vehicles with the same problem as mine so it could just be a poor paint job at Toyota's end. 
 

Now on to the good.  The car drives as well as it did when I bought it.  The interior is in great shape and it stays that way.  I enjoy knowing that every morning when I get into my car it will start up and take me to work (O.K. maybe that's not so good).  The seats are comfortable.  The trunk is large...big enough to stuff at least 3 bod...I mean 3 sets of golf clubs or a lot of groceries into.  And driving the coupe is nice because it still has that sporty edge to it while giving up very little practicality.<br><br>
