            Due to my two-year-old Toyota needing a new rack and pinion steering (another story, another time).  I rented a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix.  The ABS brakes and day-time running lights are welcome safty features as well as the dual-zone climate controls that should keep couples from killing themselves (HeHe).  The first thing I noticed was how attractive this car I styled.  In �SE� trim, as mine was equipped, there is a pleasant balance between sporty and conservative tastes.  

Once I got the car home and looked more thoroughly and noticed more than one exterior trim piece was askew and the white paint had black pit marks all over I should note that the car had less than 2000 miles on it and otherwise still appeared new.  Interestingly my father had a 1993 Oldsmobile, which was also white and had the same pit marks throughout his ownership.  Well enough about the exterior, you have probably already made up your mind if you like it or not already anyway.  

The interior is very, very, well�charcoal.  Monochromatic does not even begin to describe.  Aside from the color (or lack of) choices, the interior is nicely styled.  The seats are pleasantly shaped and there is good room for all occupants.  The drivers and passenger seat controls of my car were both manual offering both forward/back and seat back recline functions.  I wished for a driver seat height adjustment feature as I felt I was sitting a bit too low in relation to the steering wheel and windowsills.  Armrests were at pleasant locations.  Interior storage consisted of roomy glove box, covered center console, door map pockets on each front door and several open cubbies for small items (paperclips?). My biggest complaint on the interior was its use of hard plastic.  While I don�t oppose this in general, this plastic had an unfinished look to it with numerous sharp edges on it where it would be easy to catch fingers and other items.  In addition I noticed a few parts that were loose or hanging down.  Remember this is a "new" car! 

While driving the car you have a good view of the road but can�t see much of the car.  Thankfully the side view mirrors are large by car standards so lane changes are made easy. You do get the feeling that you are driving a larger car than what the Grand Prix is. I also appreciated the wipers that cleared most of the windshield.

The power train is where this car shines.  My car was equipped with the 3100 V6 engine.  I have owned and driven several cars with this engine and have always noted its smooth power and good fuel economy.  The 4-speed transmission shifted smoothly and worked well with the engine.  I did wish the trans. would fall into regular drive easier, it is quite easy to be cruising in third gear!  

The suspension was a little firmer than I prefer but overall delivered a smooth ride with minimal hassle.  The turning circle of this car was also better than expected making parking spaces a snap.  

Over all I rate this car a three out of five due mostly to the unfinished appearance of the interior and build quality that should be better in this price range.
