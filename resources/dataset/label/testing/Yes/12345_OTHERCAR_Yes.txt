            I bought this car from my sister.  We had a 2 door car and everyone knows with kids how hard that is.

Mine is Gold and has a tan leather interior.  It has an Infinity sound system with a 6 disk cd changer built into the trunk, and a security measure so that if it is stolen it won't work. The stereo has an aux jack which we use for the mp3 player but can be used for an ac/dc tv as well.  The sunroof is absolutly wonderful with 2 different settings, it lifts open in the back or all the way.  Everything is power, the sunroof, the windows, the programmable seats.  The seats can be programmed for 2 different settings, which is heaven for me because I'm 5' and my husband is 6'.  There is a passenger side airbag which can not be turned off.  Stereo controls are built into the steering wheel.  If you leave the lights on they shut off when you open the driver's door.  There is a built in alarm system as well, you arm it with the keyless remote that came with it.  It has child locks on both back doors.  The trunk is very roomy, it fit two big suitcases and 5 small bags on our trip to Disneyland.  It has cruise control, Overdrive, abs, and you can choose between economy or power setting for when you need to accelerate quickly.  The rear view mirror is light sensitive and changes on its own.  The temperature controls can be set to auto and you can choose the temperature, if it goes below or above that temp the ac or heat will turn on automatically.  The defroster also defrosts the outside mirrors.  There is a lock for the windows on the drivers door so young kids can't open them on their own. Another bonus is there is a full size spare tire in the trunk.

It is a luxury car that feels like a sports car.  It is fun to drive and comfortable to drive for many hours at a time.  The blue book on the car is still even though it is 5 yrs old $16,000.

The only con is if you are a smoker there are no gutters on the windows and the rain will drain off the roof into the car and on you.<br><br>
