            We purchased our 1999 Chevy Blazer for its versatility.  We have two boys' - ages three and five and needed a vehicle that was a 'do all'.  I wanted something to get grocercies with, take the dog to the vet (with a large size pet carrier), go to flea markets (while taking the boys' wagon to pull them in), and many other things.  And if you have children, you know you need room to haul everything that you need for them like strollers, diaper bags, favorite toy, or even the Power Wheels to Grandma's house for the day.  Being a four door it it easy to get the children in and out without bumping your head like you do in a car.  Plus, there is lots of leg room so the kids in back don't kick your seat.

He wanted something that would haul his two-place trailer for his snowmobiles in the winter and the four-wheelers in the summer.  He wanted something with power hauling as well as passing power.  And since our state has bad winters, 4-wheel drive was a must.

The Blazer is excellent in snow even if it is 12 inches or more.  We had no problems even pulling the snowmobiles.  Ours has the factory towing package and heavy duty transmission for this purpose.

Overall, the Blazer is an excellent vehicle.  We would recommend it to anyone that has multiple needs from a vehicle.
