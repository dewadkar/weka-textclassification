            I was looking for the cheapest automotive solution to get me through my last year of college.  I was going to lease a used car, buy a used car, or basically get anything that was cheap.  The Nissan Sentra was where I landed.  For under 12,000 I had a new car.  And when I sold it a year and a half later, I got back about 8,000.  Not a bad deal for a brand new car.  It isn't luxury, by any means and it's not real fancy, either.  But, it gets the job done.  I was upstate in Ithaca, NY where the snow falls and the hills are steep and my little Nissan handled quite well in often treacherous conditions.  It really was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting a piece of junk, given the low price.  

Other selling points... the gas mileage is amazing-- right in line with other small Japanese cars, I never had to have it serviced in over a year of driving (about 10,000 miles)and when it got mysteriously dented being parked on the streets of a college town (hmmmmm), it was super cheap to fix.  I took it to the Nissan dealership and they gladly gave me a cheap estimate with no hassles.  This may have been a good dealership-- I don't want to generalize for the overall Nissan customer service, because this is the only one I had occasion to deal with.

If you are looking for a reliable, cheap car, I would for sure recommend the Sentra.  For a compact car it is surprisingly spacious, and for a non-luxury automobile, the ride is fairly smooth.<br><br>
