            The 1995 Toyota Tacoma is a great truck. The Tacoma combines the classic Toyota dependency with an attractive new desing and good performance. The v6 models provide more than enough towing power, acceleration, and top end for a mid-sized truck. The rack and pinion steering is a great improvement in responsiveness compared to the previous Toyota trucks that had steering cases.

The truck gets adequate gas mileage at about 19-21mpg on the interstate and 17-19mpg in the city. The extra cab sits two people comfortably and two more that are just a little cramped. 

As for the four wheel drive, it works like a charm. No longer do you have to get out to lock in the hubs and you can shift form two-wheel to four-wheel high as long as you are under 50mph. In addition the four-wheel drive models have adequate ground clearance for moderate four wheeling, add a two or four inch suspension lift and bigger tires it becomes a good off road machine<br><br>
