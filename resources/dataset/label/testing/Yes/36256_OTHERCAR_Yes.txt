            We bought our 1998 Toyota Corolla to replace our worn out 1988 Chevrolet Corsica.  We did not have much luck with the Corsica and we were looking forward to a change.  My husband and I went to the Toyota Dealership to "look" at cars.  We ended up driving away in our new Corolla and we have been very happy with it. 

We bought the four door CE model without power door locks or windows.  We opted for the automatic transmission.  Other than that the car was mostly stock.  We wanted to keep it that way to keep the payments down.

For the past two years we have had excellent luck with the vehicle.  My husband uses it as a commute vehicle and he gets about 36 MPG on the highway and 28 MPG in the city.  We have taken the car in for warranty work on two occasions.  Once for a plastic piece in the trunk and once for a noise within the dashboard area.  Each time the Toyota people have bent over backwards to be helpful.


<b>SIZE:</b>

The Corolla is a small, compact, sedan.  My husband mainly uses it as a commute vehicle.  If you need a vehicle to cart a family around in everyday then this is not the vehicle.  If you need a commute car that you can use for family every once in a while, then this is the car for you.  

We have taken the car on many long distance drives, fitting two adults in the back and two teenages in the back seat.  My children usually bring a pillow and some other stuff with them.  SO far they have not complained that there is not enough room.   


<b>CONTROLS & FEATURES:</b>


The controls are easy to reach and use.  The vehicle handles well and the engine has adequate performance for needed speed and acceleration.


<i>STEERING WHEEL~</i>
The windshield washer control is located on the steering wheel and it makes it easy to turn the wipers on and off. While you still have your hands on the wheel.

Also located on the steering wheel is the bright lights control.  Again, making it easier to turn on and off.

The car is designed to make it less confusing for the driver and safer to turn controls off and on.

<i>RADIO~</i>
Because we opted not to put much money into the car, we got the basic am/fm/cassette player for the car.  The controls on the radio are easily to reach and understand.  I believe that the controls are driver friendly.  One touch lets you search for your favorite radio station or rewind a tape.  

<i>LIGHTS~</i>
The vehicle is equipped with day time driving lights whether you like them or not.  There is no way to turn them off.  One time I was waiting for my husband in the car and this nice lady came over to tell me that my lights are on.  If the engine is on the lights are on.  Something that I wish the car did not have.

<i>AIRBAGS~</i>
The Toyota Corolla comes with a driver's side airbag that is located in the steering wheel and a passenger airbag that is located in the dash board, just above the glove box.

It is recommended that children under 12, and adults of short, light build, particularly seniors should not sit in the front because the airbag might cause injury.


<b>FINAL THOUGHTS</b>

My husband and I both love the little car and would recommend it to others looking for a small sporty type car.

Just recently my daughter was looking at buying a new car.  Her first choice of cars was the Toyota Corolla.  But with new 2003 Corolla coming with new design it was hard to get the model she wanted, so she went with another vehicle.
