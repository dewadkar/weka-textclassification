            After my 1990 Dodge Spirit (see my 5 star review of it on here as well), was totaled, I bought a 1992 Chevy Corsica. I've had the Corsica for about a month now so I'll tell ya what I know. When my father and I first saw the car on a car lot in Charleston the outside paint job looked pretty bad. The white paint was chipping terribly. The red interior of the car clashed terribly. After checking out the car and taking it for a long test drive we decided to buy it. The dealer was asking 1900 but we talked him into 1400. We bought the car and then had it painted dark grey which toned down the red interior a lot. Now it actually looks good. 
    After the paint job we went under the hood. The engine looked immaculate for an 8 year old engine. We went ahead and replaced all the hoses, all the belts, and put new shocks and struts on it. All of that cost around $200. Since then I noticed a slow leak from the radiator. To get it fixed by a repair shop the cost would have been $250, however my dad and I found a used radiator for $35 and put it in ourselves. Anyone with a slight understanding of cars and an afternoon to spare can do this job. A new radiator for this car is kind of expensive because the car has a plastic radiator. Most cars have aluminum radiators. However, if you do not mind buying used parts they are readily available due to the fact that this was a pretty popular car. 
    The car rides very well for a car of it's age. The new shocks and struts allow for a smooth ride with no car shaking or movement caused by the engine. The seats of the car are not great, but I can drive to Charleston SC from Myrtle Beach SC (about 2 to 2 1/2 hours) without any discomfort. The transmission shifts from gear to gear with no problems and it is completely smooth as well.  
    The engine of the car is impressive as well. For an 8 year old engine with 116,000 miles on it, the engine's V6 power is still present and the engine doesn't suffer in power any noticeable amount with the AC on.
    On the inside of the car everything is pretty nice. There is an airbag on the drivers side. The speaker system in the car is pretty good for a stock system. All ranges sound clear with little to no distortion even when played at the loudest level. The power windows are a handy thing to have, but the back passenger side is slow to roll up and down. I've heard of others having this same problem. The power door locks sometimes stick as well, so most of the time I double check by pressing the actual lock itself to the locked position. 
    Overall the car is a good value. Also, the insurance for this car is relativly cheap. Mine is only $400 for a year. <br><br>
