            On June 8, 2001, I had chosen to purchase a 2001 Xterra, I was actually on my way to the dealer to hand him the money when my husband and I drove past a multi dealer show and sale.  There sat a 2002 Silver Liberty Sport 4X4.  It was the only one they had in stock. I assumed that it was out of my price range and told my husband to keep driving.  But he talked me into stopping to at least give it a look (I don't think he liked the Xterra much, but he wouldn't tell me that).  We stopped and I was amazed to find it was actually $2,000 less than the other vehicle I was on my way to purchase.  The dealer asked if I would like to try it out, so I said yes and loved it from the start.  It is beautiful.  The wonderful thing about car sales is that there are banks there as well.  I had been pre-approved by my bank, so when I decided to make the deal, I walked about 100 feet from where the Liberty sat, over to my banks booth, they cut me a check, and I drove home in my brand new Liberty about 2 hours after initially spotting the vehicle.  The back seat is not quite as roomy as others I have driven, but I am 6 feet tall, and it is not too awful cramped.  My step sons are shorter, so they fit fine.  The ride is as smooth as a car, and the power is perfect for what I need.  No snow here in the Finger Lakes Region of NY yet, so I can't talk about that, but I am confident that it will handle fine.  It is heavier than most SUV's it's size, and rides comfortably even on rough terrain.  After driving it for 3 months now, I still love the looks I get from people who have not seen one yet.  Some people have commented that it is ugly, but I like it's unique look and the combination of rugged good looks and performance really made my choice easy.  I also think the looks of it appeal to both men and women.  Compared to other SUV's that I test drove, the Liberty has almost no roll when cornering, even at higher speeds.  Since I had only owned cars in the past, that fact provided me with much relief.  The interior is nicely made and quite durable (my youngest step son, who breaks everything, has not broken any knobs or air vents yet!!!:-).  Head room is great for taller people...which I am.  Although I read that if you get the sun roof, you also get 3 inches less head room.  The back seat also has 3 shoulder belts, nice when one of the boys brings a friend along.  I have over 6,000 miles on the vehicle right now and do not have any complaints.  I was worried about buying a first year model, but I am confident that the dealer will take care of it...if they expect another sale in the future.  All in all, this is a great vehicle.   I think it's perfect for a family of four or less.  May get a bit cramped for a family larger than that.
