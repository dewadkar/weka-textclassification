   This fall I was going to go on a Hawaiian trip . I had packed all my clothes and camera gear. This is where I ran into a problem my current camera mvc-fd91 which used floppy disks. How well I knew from our last trip that I would need a ton of floppies for this trip. This was a major problem, space. I had very little so when I first saw the new mvc-cd1000 bingo here was the answer to my space problem.

 The cd's take very little room to store and are easy to use. The camera at first was a monster to use at first, but as I became used to it the size and weight became a plus. The camera fit my meat hook hands. Most other cameras I have had trouble using my hands with five thumbs. the controls were also easy to use and find. 
When I got the new camera home, I ripped the camera out of the box, charged the battery, and away I went taking pictures like a
crazy man. Did I mention that I plum forgot to read the distructions?? Darn, but they are good and easy to follow.
 
The camera is very straightforward. I really suggest if your are new to digital cameras please read the instructions. The picture quality from this unit is by far better than any other camera that I have used.
 A 1200x 1600 picture is nothing to sneeze at either and did I mention you get about 155 to 160 pictures to a disk??  Well it does do that and roughly 1000 at 640x480. This sure is a lot cheaper than those memory sticks.
 
This camera is really a pro model, but it sure can make a want to be pro really look good. I can recomend this camera as being best in class in my opinion. The camera operation is easy to learn how to use the camera. The software is very good and the ease of getting your picturers to your computer is an absolute breeze. 
There is another real neat thing you can do, download to your tv and do a picture slide show. I am sorry, I still have not played with all the toys that this camera has, but why bore you all to death go get this camera and start having fun<br><br>
