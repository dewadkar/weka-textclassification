            My wife and I were looking for a future &quot;family&quot; mobile. We wanted something that was roomy enough to haul all the kiddy equipment to grandma's house, but did not want the BMW or Lexus price tag.

It did not take much looking before we found the Isuzu Trooper. It had almost everything we were looking for in our next vehicle. Even more important it was what the Trooper did NOT have that sold us on the SUV. We did not need nor want to pay for the digital compass, leather, heated seats, etc, etc, etc. It did have air, 4 wheel drive, ABS, power windows, and locks, but most importantly was it has ROOM!

The SUV has been a sound investment for us. The only shop time it has had is preventative maintenance. It has 64,000 miles on it and we plan on doubling that before we need to look at replacing it. Yes, with another Isuzu Trooper.
