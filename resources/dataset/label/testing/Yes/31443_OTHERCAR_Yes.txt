            I bought my G20 new in 1996, it's the base model with 5-speed and a cloth interior. 

This car has been the most trouble-free and reliable I've ever owned. I've only had to replace a broken heater switch and a failed brake-light relay, for a total of less than $200.00. That's not bad for 6 years / 60,000 miles of driving.

The car is quiet, comfortable, and handles very well. Although the engine is underpowered off the line, it's great at highway speed, and the dual overhead cam really helps performance above 3,000 RPM. Passing and acceleration on the highway are great. The stick shift is very good, although throws are a little long, and there's some vibration in the stick at highway speed.

I average about 24 mpg in mixed city/highway driving, on regular gas.

Brakes are excellent, with all-disk and 4-channel ABS. The interior is nicely laid-out, with supportive front buckets, and reasonable room in the back seat.

There's no cupholders, which matters to some people. If you have to have a cupholder, buy a minivan, I hear they come with lots of cupholders.

The six-speaker CD stereo is great, the heater/AC is excellent, and very quiet. The trunk is also fairly large for this class of car.

Since it's an Infiniti, the dealership experience has been excellent. Infiniti makes a visit to the dealer a pleasure.

Overall, and excellent compact sedan.
