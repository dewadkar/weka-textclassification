            I bought a 98 Esteem 1.6 a year ago, with low mileage, but a lot of cigarette-smoke impregnated in the upholstery. Apart from AC and automatic transmission, everything else is manual, including the window. But it works, and how.
First of all, the car gives a very solid impression. All materials fit nicely and it feels very crisp, very sturdy when driving. No Ford-Taurus like dashboard noices or swimming drive-train. It rides very precisely and sticks to the road like an old chewing gum. Engine power is sufficient, and the engine behaves quite nicely and stays calm at higher revs or on the highway. But it doesn't press you in the seats either. Fuel economy is quite good, for an automatic, and the transmission itself is quite smooth as well. But the latter needs a heavy right foot to down-shift when you need some more power. The overdrive can be switched off which is nice on hilly roads.
Overall, I would recommend this car for those who are looking for a small, economic commuting vehicle, and do not want to be towed as often as those with a Dodge Neon. I predict high mileages on this model with low maintenance cost. As for maintenance, I have rarely had a car with so easy access to the oil and air filters and all other things that one can easily service one self, except for the spark plugs that require a "deep" wrench.
One small detail is that the windows in the front doors seem to be poorly fit into the rubbers, sometimes the top corner sticks out of the frame and causes wind-noise on the highway. But that may be because of high usage by the heavily smoking previous owner. O, and the standard Suzuki car-radio is no longer working.
