            If you are in the market for a good inexpensive car with a nice fit & finish, you could do worse than this car. The 2001 Kia Sephia is a fine automobile. Overall, the things it does, it does well. Excellent mileage. Good pickup, and the look of a more expensive vehicle are all right here. I drove this baby from S.F. to South Bend In. in December, and Found no trouble getting over the higher elevations. Also handled well in the snow and ice.

If I had anything bad to say at all only two things come to mind. One... The dealership is not very customer oriented. It always seems like getting regular service is a hassle and they kind of screwed us on the price. (Don't ever buy a car at a tent sale!) As far as the car itself the only gripe I have is that the vehicles turning radius is not too good. I have had difficulty parking it in spaces where I could just whip my 1980 Ford Bronco right into.

As far as mechanical problems there have not been any and I expect that will be the case for some time. It runs really well and although perhaps a hair under-powered at the top end it still zips along admirably at normal speeds. 

In summary I would certainly recommend the car as a good used Purchase. I have put quite a few miles on mine and it has held up well. There is a lot of life left in this baby.
