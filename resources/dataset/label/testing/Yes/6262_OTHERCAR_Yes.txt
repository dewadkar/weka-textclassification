            Not long ago my old car bit the dust and it was time to get something new.  I had been dreaming of getting a full-size pick-up for a long time and when it was finally within my grasp I knew that I had to opt for "The King of Trucks", the Z71.  General Motors makes both Chevy and GMC pick-up trucks that are largely identical.  To my knowledge, the only differences between these two are cosmetic.  Both are, in my opinion, great looking vehicles and appear rugged and solid in stature.  When these trucks have larger tires and ride a little higher off the ground it makes them all the more masculine looking.  GM didn�t succumb to the radical styling that Ford and especially Dodge use on their offerings.  I ended up with a 2000 GMC Sierra 1500 Z71 with 20,000 miles rather than a Chevy because I found one for a good price.  

I knew that I wanted an extended cab truck because several years ago I had a regular cab S-10 and it was way too small.  If you have never owned a truck before and are contemplating whether or not this option is worth it, let me tell you that I would never considering buying a truck without it.  The extra inside cab space is invaluable.  On my 2000 Sierra the bench seat in the back is quite roomy and most people don�t mind riding back there even with 3 abreast.  A third door makes hauling passengers easy.  

The interior is extremely comfortable and appealing.  The dash layout is pleasing to the eye and all controls are well placed and designed.  The seats are nicely shaped but just a touch too squishy.  They are by no means uncomfortable as this is the most comfortable vehicle I�ve ever owned.

Now let�s address the most important part of a truck: the drivetrain.  My truck came with the upgraded 5.3 liter V-8 engine that churns out 285 horsepower and an immense 325 lb/ft of torque.  The 5.3 (327 cubic inch) engine replaced the 5.7 (350 cubic inch) in 1999 as the upgraded engine for these trucks.  The new 5.3 actually pumps out more power with better gas mileage (about 16/23).  And I do mean power!  Stomp on the gas in this baby and your body gets thrown back in those big comfy seats like you were in a Corvette.  Towing and hauling become welcome activities because of all the extra torque.  The power is transferred to the wheels by a smooth 4 speed automatic with an excellent towing feature that adjusts the shift pattern for pulling big weight with the push of a button.  My truck is equipped with a limited-slip differential which as far as traction goes is as important as 4X4.  Don't buy a truck without this option.  I decided that I wanted to get the Z71 off-road option that is the object of many a young man�s desire.  I actually had the opportunity to put its off-road ability to the test when a friend of mine got his Jeep stuck up to the top of its wheel-wells in a mud hole.  He also got a Ford Ranger (2 wheel drive) stuck trying to get his Jeep out.  It was a pleasure using my new hoss of a truck to yank those boys out of the Georgia mud.  She performed like a champ and easily pulled out both vehicles.   

Overall, I would highly recommend the GMC Sierra to anyone who wants a full-size pick-up.  You�ll never regret buying one of these as they are so practical by nature (especially with the extended cab) and can be extremely manly and rugged with the proper options (you lady truck owners don�t worry, attractive girls driving trucks is a turn-on).  Two thumbs up!
