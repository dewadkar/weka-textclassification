            My mother has a '94 Honda Accord LX. It has been a great car for here and fun for me to drive :) It is realiable, pretty fun to drive and I must say that it does look pretty sharp.

My favorite aspect of this car is the fact that it is a realively small car with quite a bit of room. I am 6'3 and I can sit in the back seat fairly comfortably if whoever is in front moves the seat up. When I'm driving the room is also nice. I can move the seat all the way back so my legs aren't cramped in unlike in my Saturn (read my review!!!) It has the 1.8L SOCH engine with automatic transmission which is no power machine, but it gets the job done and makes it fairly fun to drive. The handling is good, but I prefer the Saturn because it is shorter and handles better. I was able to smoke my friends Jetta at a light ;) My mother puts a great deal in  city mileage on the car and it has held up really well. She has had no problems with it since she bought it in 1997. My mom picks up my sister and two or three others from school everyday which is another testament to it's durablity. The only thing that I do not like about it is the horrid and I mean horrid factory radio. You would probably rather hear me sing than listen to that piece of junk. Hopefully I can take care of that this summer.

This car is excellent overall. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a fortune to spend on a car but still wants some class. Ann by the way, get a new stereo!<br><br>
