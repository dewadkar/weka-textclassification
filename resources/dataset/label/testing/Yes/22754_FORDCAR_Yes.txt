            I am known to be extremely picky and analyze things to death. When buying a car it was no different. i new I wanted an SUV type of vehicle and after many months &quot;exploring&quot; the possibilities I chose the Ford Explorer.

Upon comparing other SUVs I found the Explorer to have a much more comfortable ride due not only to the suspension but the seats. The options available on the Explorer are reasonable and well worth the price.

I believe this vehicle is a good choice for the person or family on the move. It has excellent &quot;trunk&quot; space which can be enlarged by folding down the back seats and the passenger leg room is more than ample. 

The only down side I have found to the Explorer is gas mileage, however this is common in all SUVs. As long as the potential buyer keeps in mind they are not buying a compact car the mileage estimate will not frighten them off. 

After owning my Explorer for a few years my parents purchased one for themselves. They liked mine and thought it would be a good car for them based on my experiences with it. I was pleased to see that the quality had improved since I first purchased mine.

I have now had my Explorer for 7 years..almost 97,000 miles and I am not ready to give it up yet. It still has many, many good years in it. When the time does come to purchase a new vehicle I hope Ford will still be making the Explorer. I would buy it again.
