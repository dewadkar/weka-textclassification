            Update:

Well its almost been 2 years with this care and I still dont have any major problems.  So far the only problems have been:

1.  My battery died and

2.  Some idiot scratched it with their car door.

I cannot complain about this car at all.  I have not had to worry if it will make it to work or if I will get stranded in the desert on a trip.  I would recommend this car to anyone who wanted something dependable.


Original report:
I bought an Alero last Memorial Day.  I was 22 and getting ready to drive across the country. I wanted a quality sporty car that would not break my bank account.  I have to say I made the right choice.

The car is very sporty in comparison to my expectations.  I only get the 4 cylinder but it has enough horses to make everyone happy.  It will not throw you back into your seat at takeoff but you can blow past most every car out there.  I thought it was going to drive more like a family car, and it ended up driving more like a sports car.  The handling is pretty good for a car of its size.  The rear end will sway a little but its is expected.  

The car has a hung back seat area.  When I went car shopping I want to get something to fit 4 people comfortably and it does.  I would not mind setting in the back of this car.  There is plenty of leg and head room.  The front seats have plenty of room also.  I am amazed at the space in this car.  

I have not had a problem with this car ever.  I just change the oil every 3 thousand miles and it just keeps running.  I would definately recommend this car to college going people.  Its the perfect bridge between a sports car and a family car.  I dont know who the commercials I see for the Alero are targeted at but this car was ment for people who have grown up but just dont want to admit it.  I haven't.
