            This is a beautiful car. This is a very smooth ride. The sound system is changeable, so you can make it sound like you are in a lounge, stadium, concert, news room, etc. This just adds to the fun of the car. Mine cost 56, it came fully load and had the navigation taken off. I do not go anywhere that I do not already know how to get there. 

At night, the dash lights-up giving you that 'Fast and the Furious' feeling. 0-60 in 8 sec, that is because I have a V-6. Back wheel drive is fun, because you get a lot of power when you first start and it is always fun to fish-tail. 

The bad part about this car is that it breaks down easily; already my direction system went out...about 3 time, my heated seats sway between functioning and not functioning. You can get locked out of your car with the automatic locking doors. I am currently having trouble with my disc-brakes. My back seat cup holders keep breaking, but it is good that it is under warranty; otherwise I would have to pay to keep getting it fixed. 

Another downside is the backseat. My legs are sort of long so 'airplane' knee room is not going to get it for me. Back seat is a big minus. There is also not enough head room in the back, especially for those tall folks. 

This is a great car, people will be impressed, you will be impressed by its performance, but you'll have to own one to truly know how bad it can be.
