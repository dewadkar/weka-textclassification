            Picture this: You pull up to a stoplight in your Contour SVT between a BMW 323 and Audi A4.  You rev your engine (what a sound!), and they glance over with unapproving glances.  In their mind, no Ford can hang with their imported machinery, so they decide to show you what they've got.  OK, light turns green and you're half way down the street while they're left wondering what went wrong.  

The Contour SVT is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  OK, maybe not a sheep with all that ground work and spoiler, but at least the styling is understated.  The wolf comes right from the engine bay.  This car has possibly the best sound above 4000rpm of any car I've ever driven (This would probably change if I drove a Porsche or Ferrari, but if you're reading this, you probably aren't in that market either).  What's even better is that in casual and highway driving, the sounds does not get tiresome.  One note about highway driving, the engine does rev a little high (3500 rpm at 80mph), but is so smooth that you really don't notice.  If you drive hard, you should use synthetic motor oil (Mobil 1 is the best).  And you will drive hard just to hear that engine growl.  

The shifter is by no means the best on the market, nor is it the worst.  SVT should take some lessons from BMW on this aspect.  The clutch has a relatively short travel, and engages very smoothly.  Driving around town and in bumper to bumper traffic is not tiring at all.

The seats are very comfortable, and all 6'5&quot; of me had plenty of room during a 15 hour trip to Florida on Spring Break.  That trip brought out the best parts of the SVT.  It handles speed effortlessly (90+ mph through South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida), and is smooth all the way through higher speeds.  I wasn't driving at that speed, but from the passenger seat it felt like there was plenty more to go.  The rest of the interior is not great.  The plastic feels rather cheap, and the stereo is weak.  If you buy this car, visit Crutchfield and buy a new stereo.

Fuel economy is poor, but then again a Geo Metro would have returned poor mileage the way we drove.

One note to used car buyers:  Many SVT owners drive hard, so please have your mechanic test for engine compression and emissions.  If the reading deviate too much from when new, the car was abused, look elsewhere.<br><br>
