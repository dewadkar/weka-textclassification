            I bought my second Caravan (this time the new 2000 model) in January. I was hoping the few issues I experienced with my second hand 1995 model had been overcome, and so far that appears to be the case. These issues were mainly a noisy engine (especially when driving around the city), a less than perfect fit on the sliding side door, insufficient interior lighting and some problems with the air conditioning.

The only remaining gripes with the new 2000 version is an interior light that doesn't switch off automatically and the fact that my model doesn't have keyless locking. A co-worker has the same problem with the interior light, so that is probably not just a problem with my car.

Despite these little complaints, I'm very happy with this minivan and thoroughly recommend it to others!<br><br>
