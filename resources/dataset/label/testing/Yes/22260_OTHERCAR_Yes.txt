            I did a lot of homework on this one, as I don't make a ton of money and don't plan on spending $40,000  on a car every 3 years, like some people do.  This was going to be a 10 year car. 

I was very impressed with the fit and finish.  The exterior lines were perfect, every panel fit flawlessly (compare this the American cars like GM and Ford).  The doors slam like a vault, and the interior, from the dash to the seats are made to a very high level of attention to detail.  I am very picky about quality materials in a car and the way they are put togther.  This car was a 9 out of 10 (with possibly BMW or Mercedes, being the only 10s I know of).  The stitching of the leather and the vinal panels in the doors is perfect.  The platics used in teh dash and center console are of a very high quality and don't scratch easy.  I compared this with a $70,000 Cadillac Escalade and was amazed at how crummy the Cadillac was.  The rubber and plastics in the Volvo are really far superior than anything made in the US.  Volvo seats have consistantly been top, and these don't compromise at all.  Full size, very high quality (thick) leather that will last and last.

The safety of this cars is amazing.  From the REAL head rests, both front and rear (read the Insurance Crash Test data on it), to the 6 active safety systems like the front, side and curtain airbags, the whiplash protection system, the side impact protection system and much more.  Nothing comes close for under $80,000. 

Now my notes on the drive... This is the 2.4T, so its nimble, but not fast.  The 199hp and 210 tq (at 1800RPM to boot) is great from a 5 banger, but the 960 I had before was a much smoother engine.  The idle of the 5 is very buzzy, the car even occationally vibrates with it.  My other Volvo, the 960 was all but silent at idle.  Our car came with the 16"Metis wheel option and the fat 215/55 R16's that make the handling of this car much better than you would expect from a wagon.  I don't quite enjoy driving it as much as my '03 Passat, but it is not a wagon like ride either. 
The interior noise is a bit much for a $40,000 car, again my 03 Passat is much quieter and smoother in this area.  Wind noise, while not as bad as the 960 was, is still high for a car with this level of finnish.  The shiftable transmission is a nifty gimic, but is not anything like the Porsche/Audi Tiptronnic in response.  It seems like the torque converter robbs the engine of a lot of power in this "manual" mode.  I got unofficiaL 0-60 times of 8 seconds avg, on three runs.  I took up to 110mph with no problems on the open roads of a neighboring state that has no "published" speed limit, again the car was stable and well planted.  Claimed top speed is 131mph, but I got the impression that 110-120 was all I was gonna get without any unreasonable waiting time.  The car has S80 brakes and rotors which are designed to stop a sedan 400lbs heavier, as such the car has excellent and responsive braking, I compare  this to both my prior 960 which had a tendency to warp its thin rotors, and my curren 03 Passat..  The brakes take some time to get used to as they are almost too much in the beginning for a new driver.

Onward... 

The style if this wagon is awsome,  I came into the dealer with the intent of convincing my wife to buy an S80 sedan, as I hated the idea of driving a wagon, BUT this is no ordinary wagon.  It is faster and looks better tham most cars.  The problem is that in the world of SUV's, this wagon seems small, but it really is not.  We carry around a twin stroller in the back that will not fit in most sedan trunks, and there is still plenty of room for shopping and other stuff. The cargo net (Standard) will keep all that stuff from launching forward if there were to be a sudden stop (nice).  There is also an optional cargo cover that I use to keep things cool in the AZ summer.  The bigest problem with this car (room wise) is the leg room.  Both front and rear seem skimpy for the size of the car.  My Passat has significant more room in the rear for legs, but the width of the Volvo gives you elbow room that the Passat doesn't have.

This car is also very smart:
The way the door locks and rear hatch locks all interact and function show a lot of thought.

some smart features are:

When you put the car in reverse, while it is raining and the whiper is running, the rear whiper will automatically activate.

The gas tank access door will unlock for 10 minutes so you can get gas, but if you don't use it for that 10 minutes, it locks until you hit the unlock button again.  

The interior lights will not stay on for ever and ever and drain you battery if someone pushes the on button of one of the lights like most cars.  These lights will stay on for 10 minutes and shut off automatically, you have to reactivate them if you need them longer while the engine is not running.  

When you shut off the power to the car, but stay inside the car (you don't open the driver or front pax door) the power windows remain active, EVEN if the keys are out.  This is disabled when you open any of the front doors. 

The automatic climate control has an ion sensor that will kick the system in a standby mode if you open too many doors, this safes the car from over working for nothing.  

The stereo will automatically rise in volume to compensate for the additional road noise when you drive faster and faster.

There are so many more little "engineering" pluses that I could go on for ever.

Over all this is the best car for under $50,000 out there.  If you can get a Mercedes E320 4-matic, you may have a better wagon, otherwise you will be wasting your money.
