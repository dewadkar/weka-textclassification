            I got rid of my 1996 Chevy Impala SS and my 1999 Oldsmobile Alero GLS to buy a 2003 Honda CRV LX on January 3rd, 2003. Not your typical trade ins for a CRV. But I needed 4 doors, reliability, ride, and something I can get in and out of easily (I'm 6'4" with back problems - it hurts to get in and out of most cars). So I was looking at something I always dreaded - an SUV. But you CAN be practical and still get an SUV that doesn't weigh 5500 pounds and drive like the giant lead ball on stilts that they are. There's a few in this category, and cross shopping the CRV usually proves it to be a smart choice (there are other good ones, too, I'm sure, depending on your priorities).

I've got 14,500 miles on it so far, so I've had a little time to get used to it and lose the new car honeymoon feelings.

It's a great vehicle. It's fairly nimble, built like it was carved out of a single piece of steel, and well thought out. It has as much room in the rear seat as the 1996-2002 generation Toyota 4Runner (we have one, so I believe the government on this one). It rides far more smoothly than our 1996 4Runner. Ease of entry is about the same (the CRV is a bit lower), but I'm 6"4", so I think the 4Runner is quite fine. Shorter people sometimes find the 4Runner a bit too high, and the CRV just right. It has the best rear seat in its class, because you can fold and tumble WITHOUT removing or even touching the head rests. And, the rear seat reclines, making it a very comfortable place to ride. I've had a few niggling problems with mine, all known to Honda and fixed by the dealer under Honda TSB's.

It's not quite as sharp in handling as the Toyota RAV4, but it's far more roomy. It's not as fast as the Ford Escape/Mazda Tribute twins when they have the optional V6, but it's fairly zippy, especially if you can find the hard to obtain 5 speed manual version. Mine is an LX (automatic) 2WD model, and it still accelerates well. You can spin the front tires incessantly sometimes, thanks to the torquey 2.4L motor (and the really bad tires), I get 20 MPG in mixed driving with my foot to the floor. Highway cruises averaging 80 to 90 MPH return about 22-24 MPG.

Some tips - Honda accessories are FAR cheaper via the Internet - keyless entry, roof racks, rear cargo covers, etc., all available from Honda dealers who sell VERY cheaply. NONE of these accessories (except maybe the fog lights and tweeters or sub woofer) take more than a few minutes to install. Also, you cannot get a 5 speed without getting 4WD, too. Sorry. And NO ABS on the LX. Not available, period. Which bites if you don't want a 4WD or a sunroof (that's how the EX comes). 

Also, the OEM Bridgestone Dueler 684 tires are by far the worst tires on the planet (in this class). They are noisy, noisy, and noisy. They have little to no traction, and wear out quickly. Be thankful for that last part. Buy 4 new quality tires (even Bridgestone makes good ones - just not these) and you will be shocked at how much quieter the car is, and how it doesn't slip in the wet when taking off any longer. Keep that in mind - if you think it's too noisy to buy this car, it's usually just those cheap rubber bands they call tires. 

Still, it's the best of the cute-utes. You can't go wrong with a Honda. Check Edmunds - the cost per mile on this is awesome, thanks to traditionally stellar resale on this and almost all Hondas. It's not the zippiest or sportiest, not the best looking, but it's never lower than a solid 8.5 on the 1-10 scale, and that makes it the smart choice. After 14,500 miles, I actually don't dread the 75-90 minutes a day I spend in the car. It's quietly made my commuting very tolerable. It's subtle how that happened, but that's the mark of most Hondas - subtle, smart, solid, not flashy. I highly recommend this SUV, and I consider myself a "car guy", if that means anything to you.
