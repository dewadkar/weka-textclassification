            Toyota has the high class overseas suv market by its feet. The Land Cruiser and 4Runner are two of the best suvs I have ever ridden in and owned. I love the 4-runner as it is small in size but not in the interior. It is big enough to comfortably seat 4 adults and their gear. With an available 3.4 L V6 the 4Runner has plenty of power. TRD(Toyota racing development) can give you more if you want it. By adding their headers, cat back exhaust, and supercharger you can easily push this vehicle to 315HP. Plus you get to keep your factory warranty if they do the installation. . I highly recommend the Limited if you have the extra cash to spend. I hope you will consider this in your choices amongst the SUV market.  It is the best buy i have ever made and hopefully you will make the same one.
