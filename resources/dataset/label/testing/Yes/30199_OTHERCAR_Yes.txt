            I was a confirmed  truck lover for years,but bought a ford ranger and it was a  wimp in the winter, so one day told hubby trading it in for a  van it was gorgeous, green   had to have it. so  here i go to my car dealer to trade in my truck  for my hubby had his own vehicle, so in i go get this van which has all i ever wanted  a c  comfy inside, and i could reach the pedals   so deal made for a used 92 $4.000 wasnt bad and in good condition no rust. i was in love with it. And so  wasnt my husband, he fell head over heels  its so nice to drive  and easy on gas, but now who gets the van you ask? I will tell you anyway he leaves for work and there goes the dodge caravan going down the road, yes  there a great vehicle easy on gas, great in the winter, In fact plan on buying a new one in a few years thats how much we love them 
I think its a great van for a family or like us two people. makes room for trips easy to drive. i give it AAAAAAAA+++++.<br><br>
