            I have had my Jimmy for 2 years now and I absolutely love it.  We bought it used with 64,000 miles on it and now it is close to 100,000.  The main reason for the purchase was that I needed a 4 wheel drive vehicle to get to work in the winter.  I was pregnant with our first child and my husband felt more comfortable with me drive a 4 wheel drive.  

It is good in the snow.  I have never gotten stuck however I ddid go in the ditch once.  I did NOT have it in 4 wheel drive and it was black ice so it wouldn't have mattered.  

I have a four door which was a must with kids.  Right now I have 2 car seats in the back.  I love the back for storage.  It has a window hatch that pops open with the keyless remote.  It is so easy to load and unload groceries.  I even keep my double stroller in there all the time and there is room for groceries.  

I like the Jimmy because it is easy to drive, see out, and park.  It is like a car but also has the advantages of 4 whell drive like a truck.  The only mechanical problems I've had is a coupole of months age it wasn't running right and I took it in for a tune up and it was as good new.
