              I purchased this car in 1997 because I was in the mood for a sporty, yet classy car. The new design on the Grand Prix is very sporty and should be in a class of its own. I bought the 4 door sedan (SE) model to add a little style to a sports car. 
  I love the way the wide-track design grips the road and creates a safe feeling zipping around curves. I have never driven a car that made me feel so safe going around corners, and that is important to me because I travel the back roads of Pennsylvania quite often. And the power!!! I don't even have the super charged model and the take-off power is AWESOME! The only downside to the car is the way the seats sit low to the ground. 
  When I drive this vehicle, I feel that I am in total control of the situation, and that there isn't a road in America that I would feel afraid to drive on.
  This car when bought new is mid-priced...around $22,000 nicely loaded. Anyone who would like a little excitement in their life when behind the wheel and is in the middle class income bracket should definitely consider this car. Anyone who is afraid of power should probably stick to the Toyota!
  General Motors and the UAW made this car especially for me...and maybe you.<br><br>
