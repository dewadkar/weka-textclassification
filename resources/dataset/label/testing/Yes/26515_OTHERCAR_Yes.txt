            This is another Chevrolet Product that I had the total pleasure of driving and selling. Being that I am not normally a strict &quot;Chevy Guy&quot; I am very impressed with their 99 and 2000 revisions to most of the line of cars and trucks. The S-10 has always been in my opinion one of the better lookers in the small pick up line. 

I first drove one of the 99's when I was running out to lunch, once I got going down the road I decided to go to the Arbys on the other side of town. This truck was not highly equipped and not the least bit customized but I really was impressed. Chevrolet has not made any flaws that I have been able to find on this one. They spiced up the front end a little which has made a huge improvement on the truck from previous years. The truck I was driving was a manual 5 speed transmission and I was in Phoenix. Normally a nightmare. They placed the shifter in a comfortable area so as not to make your arm tired. It had a very responsive Vortec V-6. And yet highly affordable compared to other small pick ups in its class. 

As always the resale value on trucks is alot higher than cars but yet the S-10 is affordable how can that be? Well the answer is they hold their value but it is sold new as an affordable vehicle so as to please the consumer and their pocket book.

There was no detail left out including the extensive safety features and durability.<br><br>
