            I have owned two Honda Civics.  Sadly, I do not own either one any more, through no fault of their own.  The first one was a used 1986 hatchback we bought as a second family car.  It was wonderful.  It came to a sad end in a wreck in 1997 but in the meantime I had NO problems with it aside from normal wear and tear.  It was small, but it was super reliable.  

When the hatchback went the way of all good cars, I bought a used 1994 Honda Civic Coupe.  What a cute car!  Just like the first one, this car was completely reliable.  I owned it for two and a half years before I traded it in for a new Accord, but in those two and a half years I never had a problem of any sort.

The Civics are small, don't let anyone tell you different.  If you're six feet tall they are probably not the car for you.  But I am 5' 6&quot; and NOT petite and I was very comfortable in both of my Civics' front seats.  Back seats are only for small people or children, I think.

For reliability, there's NOTHING like a Honda.  I will never buy anything else.<br><br>
