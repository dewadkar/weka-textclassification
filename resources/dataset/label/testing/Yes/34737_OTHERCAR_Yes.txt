            We came to own our 1997 VW Passat when we decided to start our family.  4 doors are always a plus when hauling a baby seat in and out constantly.  

First impressions of this car were positive.  

BODY STYLE:  I liked the body style~trendy, but not a bubble.  I like a car with some edge to it; I'm not a true fan of the perfectly oval body styles so prevalent today.  I also liked the midnight blue color~a classic.

INTERIOR:  The leather interior was a nice step up for me &amp; so much easier to clean off than fabric seats.  The front seat area is roomy and I have received rave comments from backseat passengers about the amount of leg room they have.  

TRUNK SPACE:  THIS makes the car, in my opinion. The trunk is cavernous!  I can keep my daughter's stroller in this car at all times and STILL bring home a full load of groceries, no problem.  I also have a home party business that requires me to take my wares to hostess' homes.  I can get most everything in this trunk.  It is amazingly large once you open it.

AMENITIES:  Our Passat comes with an alarm system and sunroof.  There are several other niceties I have not had on any previous car I've owned.  First, you can lock or unlock all doors from the driver's or passenger side.  Also, if you neglected to close the sunroof or close the windows, you can also do this from the door lock.  By holding the key over after locking the doors, the windows will automatically close for you.  You can also put the windows down by holding the key in the &quot;unlock&quot; position.
The driver can also put down any window in the car from the driver's seat.  This is a handy device for parents as they drive around with children.  Parents will also be happy to see child safety locks on the backseat windows.  Overall, this car looks snappy &amp; drives with pep and smooth handling.

The only downside to the Passat comes with routine maintenance costs.  Depending upon where you live and whom you can find to service your Passat, your maintenance fees can get you down.  We pay upwards of $90 for oil changes.  Tires are also more expensive than the run of the mill and I can only imagine what brakes may cost when we have to have those put on soon.  Our Passat has been driven all over the country so many other '97 Passat owners have not even had to think of some of the maintenance we have.  The car is a great car for families, but maintenance fees can become an issue if you plan to stretch your budget to fit the Passat.
