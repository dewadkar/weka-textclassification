            The Rodeo is great for people that need or want a SUV, but don't want to feel as if they are driving a &quot;boat.&quot;  The rodeo is sporty, comfortable and is like driving a car, not a truck.  I bought my Rodeo in 96 with 60,000 miles on it and have added 30,000 since.  I've had no mechanical problems and only a couple of minor things I've had to replace. It's great because you can quickly fold down the back seats for a flat cargo space which is convenient compared to other vans and SUVs.  It's fun to drive and comfortable for both the driver and passengers.  It comfortably seats 4 (5 is a sqeeze).  The seats come with removable covers that can be machine washed which helps out if there are any spills or mishaps.  The one thing that drives me crazy about my Rodeo is that there are no cupholders and no place to set drinks period. The v6 is nice when you need the power to go up hills or pass.  I've gotten into one &quot;fender bender&quot; with my Rodeo where I was rear-ended and I had no damage while the car that hit me looked like it had been in a train wreck.  The Rodeo is substantial without feeling too heavy, large or bulky. I'd recommend the Rodeo to anyone that wants the power and cargo space of a truck, but wants something that is sporty and easy to drive.    <br><br>
