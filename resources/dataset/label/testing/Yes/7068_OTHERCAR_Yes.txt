            I was upgrading from a Nikon Coolpix 900s. I had narrowed my search down to the Coolpix 950 & 990 and the Fuji 4700 zoom. I searched for as much information as possible (which fuji.com really lacks) on all cameras and felt the 950 coolpix was a strong runner given a $100 rebate. 

My list of considerations were AA batteries, download time, image quality, portability (if it isn�t small it won�t go everywhere with you). Battery performance, memory included, able to be used by friends with out a full manual, able to grow with my ability.
 
The Fuji was a winner - I just couldn�t find the information to support my decision. If the camera was twice the size it would amaze, but such a tiny package doesn�t get the serious attention it truly deserves. It uses only 2 AA batteries and captures a lot of photos and 80 second videos with a pair. The USB takes 2 minutes to download 64mb of images (yes it can handle 64mb smart media). I was impressed with the performance of the tiny flash - it lit a dark room and showed excellent detail.
 
So what are the pictures like???  The picture quality alone justifies the very reasonable price (Don�t pay retail). I took several pictures of an old church at 1280x960 (medium picture size) and zoomed in on the image on my PC... I zoomed to 500% and was just starting to see depixelation (granted a 75dpi monitor allows for zooming). I know the Fuji would make my once impressive 900 Coolpix images look bad but I had no idea how bad they now look. 

The TV connectivity is great....  Take pictures at a party...  share them Via TV (or let them video record them) and also play back the mini videos too!!

If you are looking for a point and shooter you wont be lost with this camera, yet it has the scope to meet needs of a semi pro with a multitude of manual features and settings.

I have NO negatives about this camera...  It is the best $669 I have spent. A word of caution with buying mail-order - be very specific as to just what is included in the package - the best price is never the best deal - they skimp on the included 16mb card, 4AA's and charger which according to Fuji are part of the package...   

This camera will not disappoint....



        ******* UPDATE *******

I have had the camera almost a year now - I have taken almost 4900 photos and mini videos and this little camera has not had a single problem. It has never once let me down.

I tend to take all my pics at medium file size so as to maximise the amount of shots I can get (usually 450 or so on a 64mb card). This camera is also compatible with the new 128mb Smartmedia card - available online for less than $100.

I have taken this camera everywhere with me (to work every day) cause lets face it - if you dont have it with you you cant use it.

I am still VERY impressed by battery usage. I usually leave the LCD off (saves a lot) but find I can take dozens of shots back to back using the flash and still have power to burn.

I have been shopping around recently at all the "new" cameras around though I still cannot see anything worth upgrading to. This little wonder has it all and does it so very well.

I hope yours is half as good - you will be amazed.
