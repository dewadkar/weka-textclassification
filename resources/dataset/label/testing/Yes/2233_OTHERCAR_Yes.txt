            In June of 1999 my wife and I purchased a 1997 GMC Jimmy SLE.  If was fully loaded with A/C, tilt, cruise, 4WD, temperature/compass gage, fold down back seats and dual opening back hatch (window only or full back door).  It was truly a pleasure to drive and helped us in our antique business with its ample storage.  We could load boxes of antiques, furniture and supplies quite easily and we were amazed at how much we could cram in the Jimmy.

It was a terrific vehicle to drive, both in town and on the freeway and could cruise all day at 70-80 MPH.  The ride was much better than some luxury cars or other SUVs I have driven.

Recently, we traded in the Jimmy for a motor home/RV so we could haul antiques and sleep in the same vehicle on long road trips to antique shows.  Yes, the RV has more storage and sleeps 6 but it's not a Jimmy.  I never thought I would miss a vehicle more than some of my past friends but I do.  

If I ever get the chance to buy another GMC Jimmy, I won't hesitate.  It is a great all-around SUV.<br><br>
