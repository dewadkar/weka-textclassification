            It was time to get rid of the Fiero I'd purchased on a whim right around my 50th birthday.  How practical is a two-seater when one has three grown children and a grandchild?  How ridiculous is it to have to rent a car for family outtings?  At the time I bought it, I was sick and tired of all children AND family outtings--it was MY time!!  In less than a year, however, I knew the Fiero's time was up.  I'd begun to realize it was one of the dumbest purchases I'd ever made.  Not only were parts difficult to find because Fiero's were out of production, the NEED for parts was increasing in frequency.  (Besides, wasn't there was a REASON why the Fiero was out of production...??)

I'd been eyeing the VW Jettas I'd seen jetting on the roads.  They looked zippy, clean-lined, practical, youthful.  The people driving them appeared to be enjoying themselves.  I began to research cars on the Web and the Jetta Wolfsburg Edition came out the winner.  It was the best bang for the buck.  The Wolfsburg's standard features:  power steering, sunroof, electric windows, A/C, alloy rims, 6-CD changer in trunk, 8 stereo speakers, keyless locking system, and more I'm not remembering.  I went ahead and arranged a new-car loan with my credit union for $17K, Kelley Blue Book's 1998 Jetta Wolfsburg Edition retail price.

Armed with my approved loan (at 8%) and supreme knowledge supplied by the Web, I went to the Boardwalk dealership in Redwood City where a friend of a friend had just purchased her Jetta Wolfsburg.  I test drove the Jetta and fell in love--it was comfortable, smooth-riding, corned like a Beamer, the sound system was good, and I could adjust my steering wheel and the height of my seat.  I wanted it!  The smarmy sales guy would only go down to $16,500.  

Fortunately, another friend highly recommended the Dorito Brothers dealership in Walnut Creek.  I trekked out there, assured it was worth the ride.  I knew exactly what I wanted--color, interior, etc.  I also had a price with which to bargain.  The unusually straight-up Dorito Brothers sales guy, who also owned a '98 Jetta Wolfsburg and loved it, told me about the two-year free maintenance package that was also included as standard.  He didn't push me, but he wouldn't come down in price from the $16,500 quote I'd received from Boardwalk.  What he DID do was offer a 4.9% loan if taken with VW Credit--he showed me the calculations that the car would end up costing less, with lower monthly payments, because of the lower interest rate.  It was a no-brainer, I'm easy...I was sold!  I happily drove off the lot with my gleaming, brand-spanking-new, white 1998 VW Jetta Wolfsburg.  I named her Joan, for Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.  

It's two years later now, I've had absolutely no problems with her (now watch something go wrong!).  During these two years, I got Joan serviced regularly at the dealership nearest me, no hassles, no cost to me.  In between, I get the oil changed every 3,000 miles.  People get in the car and say, &quot;Nice car!&quot;  I respond, &quot;LOVE my Jetta!&quot;  

A final note:  When the 1999 Jetta came out, completely redesigned in body, I was forever grateful I'd purchased when I did--do NOT like the looks of the newer model Jettas.  Consumer Reports rates the 1998 model higher than the newer models--in fact, the 1998 Jetta is ranked higher than the Audi 4.  Not bad for $17k!<br><br>
