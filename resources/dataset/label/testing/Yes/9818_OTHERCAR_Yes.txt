            The Z28 doesn't need to make any apologies for what it is, it's a brute.

Pure and simple, its purpose in life is to make other lesser vehicles like Camrys, Accords and Escorts feel humble.

You don't buy a Z28 to be quiet and calm, you can buy a green one to be a little more subtle, but it is only a little subtle. The moment you push the throttle pedal to the floor you lose all sense of control. The car surges forward, blasts through the 55 limit, easily capable of three times that speed.

For a larger car it handles pretty good too, you will never find its limits out on a public road (thats why I race in AutoX). With 4 wheel disc and ABS its braking is almost as good as its acceleration, always controlled, always rapid.

The big surprise is its capacity for swallowing things, as a 2+2 it can haul 4 people around easily. When I go racing the back seat folds down and I pop in a huge cooler chest, 2 ton jack and 4 spare wheels with my racing tires on.

If you think a Camry is a good car, its not the car fow you, however if you show any signs of life from the neck up take a test drive, it'll stir your soul. <br><br>
