            We bought our Grand Caravan LE 4 years ago.  At the time, the odometer read 150,000 miles.  Right way, I had to replace brakes, struts, strut bearings, front wheel bearings, right half shaft, and the water pump.  After a year or so, the transmission gave up.

Now, the odometer reads 188,000 miles and the van just keeps on going.  Our primary use of this vehicle is picking up groceries, and hauling kids to activities.  Since the transmission rebuild, it has not cost us any more money other than scheduled oil changes.

We really like the extra room in the rear.  Previously, we had a regular length Caravan.  While it was nice, we appreciate the extra room of our Grand Caravan.  

The LE is loaded with tinted glass, cloth interior, power windows, power locks, compass, and outdoor thermometer.  

The 3.0L engine is a wonderful engine.  It presently smokes oil and therefore burns about a quart of oil in every 600 miles or so.  I figure that the little extra cost of oil is not as much as an engine rebuild.
