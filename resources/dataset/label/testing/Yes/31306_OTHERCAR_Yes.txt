            I own an X5 3.0 - model year 2003.  It has the premium package (leather, wood, power seats, memory, etc) and xenon lights.  The cost came to approximately $45,000 , but well worth the money...

The X5 exudes class when you look at it...just based on sheer looks, it definitely holds its own when compared to the Lexus RX (too egg-box looking), Acura MDX (looks like a minivan), Mercedes ML (looks nice, but the X5 definitely looks more slick)...

One thing that is very apparent is that the X5 is the best handling SUV out there (save for the new Porsche Cayenne - which is also in a different price league)...I've driven many BMW's - among them a 740il, 745Li, 323ci, 330xi, 528i and 530i...I must say that in size and drive the X5 3.0 reminds me the most of the 5 series...clean edged handling which really let's you toss this car around...body roll is absolutely minimal - you feel like you're driving a sports sedan...

The only other car in this segment which I have driven would be the MDX...Let's do a head to head comparison...First off, the MDX touches upon one area where BMW lacks...it has much more bang for the buck: If I wanted the premium sound system it would be additional, xenons are additional, navigation is additional...Most of these, save for the xenons, are standard in the MDX and it is cheaper (about 38K)...But, when it comes to the rest you'll notice the BMW interior is definitely higher grade (as far as wood and leather feel)...And the drive does not even compare - although a stock MDX is more powerful than a stock X5 (260 vs. 225 hp), it's like comparing the drive between a Porsche and a Toyota MR-2...there's a world of difference...The MDX had so much body roll that I could not even enjoy the smooth ride...

With regards to acceleration and cornering, I think it's efficient to say the BMW is peppy and quite good in both categories.  The ride is beautiful.  Interior is very nice.  Cargo area could be a little better.  It all comes down to your own personal liking...

If you have a small family (4-5 people), enjoy performance cars and German engineering, and do not want to compromise this with an SUV, the X5 is undeniably your number one choice (once again, unless you want to shell out over 75K for a Porsche Cayenne)...if you are someone who has a big family, absolutely needs the extra room and just wants a smooth drive and some bang for the buck - go for the MDX...but, you are missing out on the better automobile...
