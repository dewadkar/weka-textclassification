            We have owned two Chrysler mini-vans in the past and once again found ourselves in a position where we needed 5 shoulder harnesses for the sake of safety.  Our Isuzu Trooper was one harness short, so my wife suggested we trade it for a mini-van.  I hated the other vans we had due to the lack of power and poor ride.  After test-driving the Honda Odyssey, I changed my mind.  We've had it for five months now and it has been nothing short of spectacular!  The horsepower beats a lot of coupes on the road and the ride is firm yet comfortable with very little roll, a problem with the other vans we've owned.  I understand the chassis is a slightly modified Accord set-up, which explains the ride.  The dual electric side doors are handy and make loading and unloading the kiddos easy as pie.  The disappearing third seat is a neat invention for those times you need the extra floor space.  No more back-breaking seat removal!

I would recommend the Odyssey to any family that needs the seating space, but still want acceleration and handling.  This is the first family vehicle that I actually like to drive.<br><br>
