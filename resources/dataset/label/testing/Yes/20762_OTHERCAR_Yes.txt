            I bought this truck in December of 2000. At the time I was living in Portland, ME during an especially harsh and productive winter.  I was working with kids so I needed safe, reliable and roomy transportation.  This vehicle was just what I needed.  I then moved to Sarasota, FL and this vehicle was much more than I needed.  The gas mileage was killing me financially. I was driving 35 miles each way to work - it got very expensive!  Also, right during rainy season the wipers quit on me and I had to replace a part there.  The air conditioning compressor also died about 5 months after purchase.  Don't try to haul too much a long distance.  Lost the transmission that way ($$).  I like this truck a lot, but it really has been a big expense for my family.  I am not trying to sell it and get something more economical.
