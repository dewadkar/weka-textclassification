            I bought a Honda Civic LX in 1996 and its been the best car of my life. This car is the first auto I have purchased new "off the lot". The approximate cost was 17,000 (tax, financing, etc.). This was the year Honda switched from the model with all the soft curves, to the more angular looking body.

Previous cars.
I have owned a variety of VW products in the past -- never a good experience with a golf or GTI. They are horrible cars. The next best autombile that I could compare the Honda Civic to was our 1992 Toyota Celica that we owned for about 10 years. Both Japanese made automobiles run flawlessly.

Reason we bought it.
Brand and cost were the biggest factors contributing to the decision to purchase this model. The only other brand we would have considered was Toyota, however after spending some time looking at their available models, nothing felt "sedan" enough for us. All the Toyota models felt too small or inappropriately "sporty". We are entirely sold on the reliability of the Honda brand. I used to live in Ohio near the Marysville Honda plant. Many transplanted Japanese in the Ohio area -- all driving Civics and Accords! The cost was right for us. With air conditioning, power windows, cruise the total was 14,500.

Maintenance.
I am a scheduled maintenance freak. I have taken my car into get every milestone maintenance the Honda book (book that cam with the car) suggested. There are check-ups that get performed about every 15k miles. I only have 50k miles on the car so my next one is at 60k. The only service we have had done to the vehicle was the breaks. Thats it! The car has run perfectly since we bought it. Never a problem. One other thing we do religiously is have the engine oil changed every 2500 - 3000 miles. I highly recommend you do the same. I think this really increases engine life and overall performance.

The driving experience.
Well, its a Civic. It is meant to get you around (with a little bit of style) without the glamour of a euorpean sport sedan (No, its not a volvo, bmw or saab!). Overall the driving response is fairly tight; pickup is just "ok". If you are used to having a lot of acceleration and torque and passability, bypass the Civic. This car is best at getting great mileage -- not killer performance. We get about 35 mpg. Sometimes more if we use the best gasoline and on the highway. This is the part we love: being able to giggle at our friends who put 25$ - 40$ worth of gas in their SUV every 5 - 7 days. You'll be making fewer trips to the gas station in a Civic! One thing that is kind of bad about the vehicle is road noise. If you are sensitive to noise, this car will kill you. I find it pretty irritating, however we do not go on many road trips so it keeps the ear ringing down.  Another potentially negative attribute is interior room. If you are wanting a lot of interior, Civic might not be a good choice for you. This car is small-ish in size; perfect for the couple starting a family or a student but maybe not so great for a growing family of four ...
