            First, I'll just comment about the name.  <b>&quot;Beretta&quot;</b>, it just has a way of rolling off your tongue.  
Say it...<i>Beretta</i>...I bet you want to go out right now and buy one!  Ok, ok...Maybe not, but never the less, it is a good car!  I don't know about where you live, but where I am, Beretta's are probably one of the cars I see around the most.  They (speaking in general) are pretty reliable cars to get around in.  Don't get me wrong, we all have problems arise with our vehicles, but that can be expected from a car that has 130,000 miles on it.  

Anyway, enough of my non-sense babbling.  Here's why I like <i>my</i> Beretta:

*It has made it 130,000 miles with few problems in between.

*Stylish look.

*Pretty good gas mileage (about 20 mpg).

*Interior design looks good.

*Controls are placed in good areas so they are easy to access.

*Seats are comfortable, which makes any trips nice.

There's plenty more reasons I love my car, but I won't bore you by listing them all!

The only real disadvantage is that the cloths that cover the seats do wear over time.  I have a little rip on the drivers side seat, but that's from getting in and out of it several times.  If you own or purchase a Beretta, I'd recommend getting seat covers to prevent tearing.  

If you're looking to buy a car that isn't going to cost a fortune, take a look at the Beretta, they are made very well!<br><br>
