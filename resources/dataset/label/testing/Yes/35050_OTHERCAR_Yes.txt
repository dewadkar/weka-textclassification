            If you are wondering about buying a Land Rover, I am sure you have heard two different sides.  Some say, it's too large and too wide, others love the all time four wheel drive and the comfort.  In my opinion, both sides are right.

First the people that say it's too large and too wide.  Most of the people that have said that, I know are from southern areas.  My answer to this is sure they have a total right to say that.  They have no need for big SUV's like that in cities in the south.  They don't get snow so there is no need.  Four wheel drive is only needy at a ranch or farm.

For people like me in the North owning a Land Rover is great! It's mobile in the snow, it is comfortable, and it has great traction for hills and mountains.  That is another reason why people in the south don't want it.  They live in relatively flat areas like Texas to Florida, and all the way through the great plains.

The car rides very smooth and it has been very handy to me this winter.  The model I own is a Land Rover Discovery Series II.  

My final thought would be if you are living in areas that are higher in elevation and get frequent snow in the Winter, this car is for you.  Others in the south should not really need a car like this.  Two thumbs up for this car!<br><br>
