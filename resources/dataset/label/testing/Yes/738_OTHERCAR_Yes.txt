            The Nissan Altima is an extremely quiet and refined mid-size car.  The four cylinder engine is fairly large at 2.4 liters.  The engine likes to rev and is nearly silent while doing so.  The 5 speed manual and the 4 speed automatic both give adequate acceleration.  Don't expect to put five adults in the car for any reasonable amount of time.

Although the car is rated at approximately 33 mpg on the highway I have seen numbers up around 40 mpg, pretty good for a car that can actually hold 4 people comfortably.

This vehicle is ideal for a small family, or anyone who wants a reliable sharp looking four door at a low price.  

My 1994 Altima has now 115,000 miles on it and the only thing I have replaced on it has been the muffler.  (I lived in the salt capital of the world.)  The only problem I have with this car is the placement of the cup holders, they cover the stereo when pulled out.

All in all this is great family car and can be gotten at a great price used or new.
