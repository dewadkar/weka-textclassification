            My family owns a '91 Ford Taurus wagon in black.  When the car was first new and I was smaller I would sit in the back of the car and wave to people that were behind us.  This back seat that has 2 seatbelts and limited leg room has been quit helpful over the last 9 years.  We have been able to bring home those last few children whose parents were to busy to come and pick them up at school in the middle of the blizzard of the century.

This car has lasted the test of New England winters well.  Rarely has there been a time where with snow tires and front wheel drive have I not been able to get where I needed to go when I needed to go there.  Although, the radio can no longer be turned off while the car is running and the rear windshield wiper no longer wipes the car as a whole has done well so far.  There have not been many significant repairs that we have had to do and I am happy taking the car on long trips even though there are 110 thousand miles on the speedometer.

I recommend this car for families that either pack a great deal when they go away for a weekend or for families with more than 1 child.  This is a family car.  The 6 cylinder engine can carry the weight of a full car with ease but this car certainly doesn't have terrific pickup.  I am enjoying this Taurus and I believe it would be a good investment for any young family in the years to come.<br><br>
