            I purchased a 2000 Mazda Protege ES about a month ago.  After spending lots of time looking for a car, I was completely satisfied when I got into this one.

Originally I had my heart set on a 2000 Volkswagon Jetta, but with all the features I wanted, the cost was just too high. And the guys at the Mazda dealer were much more intelligent than the ones at the Volkswagon dealer.

My model is a 5-speed, 1.8 liter, 4 cylinder.  All leather interior.  It came already equipped with a nice spoiler on the back also.  The only thing it is missing is the Sunroof I wanted, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.   

The engine has a lot of pep to it, even though it is only a 4 cylinder.  It has the same engine they put in the Miata, so its a good one.  I still haven't found anything I don't like about the car.  The air is Ice cold.  (quite a difference from my old car)  

I've already taken the car on a few 300 mile road trips, and it is very comfortable.  Even with 2 people in the back seat.  They all said they had plenty of leg room, and the trunk had enough space for all of us to pack our stuff in.

I think this vehicle is very suitable for anyone.  The 626 is a better option if you like a bigger car, but the Protege has plenty of room, but I never get the feeling that I'm driving a boat around, like I do when I drive my friend's 2000 626.  Its good for highway driving and gets excellent gas mileage, which we can all use with the gas prices the way they are going.
