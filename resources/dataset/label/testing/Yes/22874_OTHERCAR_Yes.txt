            My Shadow is a '93, and I bought it in early 2002.  It only had 73k miles on it, so I pretty much had a new car.  I like the looks (even for a 4 door) and it definately has good response.  It's a quick little car!  

I bought it from a mechanic friend of mine who I completely trust.  Every car I've bought from him has been a winner, but this one is the best yet!

Here's the good and bad news about these cars, and it seems to be a common design flaw: 

About every 80k miles, you need to replace the timing belt.  Every report I've read on Epinions said it (yes, I did my research on Epinions before buying it), and everyone I know who had/has one confirmed it.  Here's the good news: It's easy to do yourself and inexpensive to have a mechanic do it for you (NEVER take your car -- especially older ones -- to the dealership.  They'll soak ya.).

Yes, the paint DOES chip easily.  My friend used a pressure washer to try to get bird nastiness off his and took the paint right off!  

The stereos do suck.  So I replaced it with a better stereo, now I have to replace the speakers.  The stock speakers suck too.  And I'm not talking about a boomin' stereo.  40x4 watt stereos distort the stock speakers.  Not a big prob., 'cuz it's easy to take out & replace!

Another problem I've come across, and I'm told it's relatively common, the seal on the hatch starts to leak and rain will collect in the spare tire compartment.  That's a bad thing.  I didn't know about it until it rained (cincinnati has 3 seasons: summer, rain, cold.  It rains in the spring & fall, and is just cold in winter -- hardly snows.  Doesn't make the cold worth it.) and after a while, I noticed a moldy smell.  Bad thing about that?  No drain holes.  So I drilled a few and when I replace the hatch seal (about $40 at the dealer), I'll plug 'em up.

My back-up lights didn't work, so I checked the bulbs, no prob.  I checked the fuse, no prob.  My mechanic friend said it's probably the switch on the transmission.  I had to get the part at the dealer ($15) and it's EASY to get at and replace.  All it took was one wrench (or pliers).

This isn't a problem, but it's worth a mention.  I'm 6'4", 265lbs.  I'm not a short person, I'm not a small person.  The front seats sit a little close to the steering wheel.  It's not uncomfortable after you get used to it.  The seats are pretty comfortable.

All of these really are small problems.  The most costly would be the paint.  Having automotive experience, the repairs were quick & simple.  You don't have to be ASE certified to work on these things!  It's a lazy mechanic's dream!

Would I buy one again?  Almost did for myself (the one I've been describing was for my wife).  The only reason I didn't is because I have a working car that I've put too much money in to make it a working car ('91 for tempo), and I can't justify selling it just to buy another one (now that the money's all been spent on it!).

Don't let the things mentioned in any of these reviews shake ya.  They're great & dependable little cars.  It's too bad they stopped making them.  I guess they weren't making enough money on repairs & parts.  I used to be a chevy man, now I'm a dodge kind of guy!
