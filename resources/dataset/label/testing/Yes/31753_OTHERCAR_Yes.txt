            I know what <i>I've</i> always thought about BMW's and their owners.  BMW advertises their cars as &quot;the Ultimate Driving Machine,&quot; and I was always skeptical of that claim.  With the existence of such machinery as Ferrari and Maserati makes, how could a mere <i>sedan</i> have the arrogance to make that claim?  And most of the owners I'd seen were all hair and teeth and driving gloves, cutting off all the less-worthy traffic in <i>their</i> expensive car.  Jerks, in a word.

Then I drove one.  It was a used 325i convertible, and it changed my mind forever.  There was no single facet of the car that I could point to...the whole car simply worked in a concert that I wanted to hear more of.

When I drove that 325i we weren't in the market for a European car, but in early 1999 we were, and I found that BMW's freshly redesigned 323i sedan fit within our budget goal; around $27,000 with the options we wanted.  So we returned to the local BMW dealer, and test drove a black 323i sedan with the base 2.5 liter, 170-horsepower inline six-cylinder engine, and the base 5-speed manual transmission.  There was no sports suspension package on this car, either.  This was about as basic as you can get from BMW, mechanically.  (There were some creature comforts added in.)

Our first impression of this car was that it looks <i>good.</i>  It doesn't just sit, it <i>hunkers.</i>  BMW has draped some really gorgeous sheetmetal over their sedan -- purposeful, mean, tasteful and restrained all at the same time.  Inside, the Bavarian company has really worked to turn around the public's opinion of their interiors as stark, bare-bones &quot;driving chambers,&quot; and installed a comfortable interior similar to the 5-series that was introduced in 1998.  The 3-Series is available with leather, but the standard leatherette is such high quality that it could easily be mistaken for leather.

The seats are very comfortable, and infinitely adjustable to match almost any physique.  The driver's station is very well laid out, with the steering wheel, shifter and secondary controls all within easy reach.  The back seat was not large, but there was enough legroom behind my seat for an adult to spend short amounts of time there.  However, the trunk was rather small, only 10.7 cubic feet, according to Edmunds.com.  Without the optional folding rear seat, this makes packing for trips interesting.

But people don't buy a BMW for the trunk, they buy it to drive, and that's where this entry-level Bimmer really wins out.  I think the 323i was the best car I've ever driven.  I'll grant that I haven't delved into Porsches and Bentleys yet, but to this point in my life the BMW stands out as close to perfection as I've yet sampled.

The engine is smooth, to start with an understatement.  To say it's turbine-like is a cliche, but it's completely true.  This is a motor that never displays the slightest hint of vibration or discord, whether at idle, at 95 miles per hour, or anywhere in between.  Under hard acceleration, it emits a muted whine somewhat akin to a turbojet and the car goes faster.  No fuss, no muss.  For a base-level engine, this is impressive, as is the effortless way the car accelerated up a freeway onramp and merged into traffic -- when I looked at the speedometer it was passing <i>through</i> 95 mph with no sign of stopping.

This is exactly where the 323i shines:  High-speed expressway driving.  Tuned for the German autobahns, this car is stable and rock-solid at extra-legal speeds.  It has relatively slow-ratio steering which makes it twitch-free at higher speeds, yet retains a masterful level of &quot;feel,&quot; to keep you completely in tune with what the front wheels are doing.  When I informed my wife that we were going 95, she asked, &quot;How's it handle?&quot;  I simply took my hands off the wheel.  I can't think of another car that I would even contemplate doing that in.

The handling of this car is astounding, to put it bluntly.  It clings to curves with minimal body roll, and communicates precisely what it's doing to the driver.  Conversely, I sometimes felt like I could just think &quot;move left an inch&quot; and the car would do precisely that, without any physical input from me.  If the pavement changed from concrete to asphalt, that change is communicated to the driver -- not <i>transmitted</i>, there's no harshness -- but the car simply informs the driver of each intimate detail of what the tires are doing.

While most cars that handle exceptionally well do it at the expense of a smooth ride, the BMW's ride is buttery smooth.  Potholes, expansion joints and ripples in the road are soaked up and disposed of neatly by the car's 4-wheel independent suspension.  All the occupants of the car notice is a little &quot;slap&quot; noise from the tires, and the driver is politely informed, without any discomfort, that the left front tire just passed through a 2&quot; by 6&quot; pothole.

If there is a downside to this car, it's that it is not a city car.  It has a solid, heavy clutch; long, slow throws of the gearshift lever; and that slow-ratio steering that's so beneficial on the freeway makes it harder to crank the car around tight parking lots and city corners.  While the 323i will <i>do</i> what you ask it to, it is decidedly more comfortable when it's eating the interstate miles.

The biggest impression we got from this car is that it is seriously trying to be the &quot;Ultimate Driving Machine.&quot;  It does everything as a single unit, and without comment.  In fact, this is a car almost totally devoid of personality beyond simply saying &quot;drive me now.&quot;  With everything at the same high level of quality, we were left with no single attribute to point to as our favorite.

After it was all said and done, the 323i was the #1 car on our list of four.  Unfortunately for us, the dealerships in three states refused to deal on the price, as the freshly introduced car was &quot;flying off the lot at list price,&quot; as one dealer put it.  Rather than pay that much, we humbly moved to our #2 car on the list, which we have been totally happy with to date.  But man, I wish they'd dealt.<br><br>
