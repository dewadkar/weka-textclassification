            My husband received this camera as a reward for 15 years of service for the company he was employed.  Unfortunately, he rarely has the opportunity to use it as I have taken possession of it!

We have had the Panasonic PV-DC3010 camera for approximately 4 months now, and it has replaced all of our other cameras.  The picture quality is excellent; close to portrait quality.  The instructions for use are lengthy, but clear and easy to understand.  There are many "traditional" options such as zoom, red-eye elimination, date stamping and automatic flash for those reluctant to "go digital".  There are unique features as well such as: the 10 second movie with sound, a multimedia card that can be removed and inserted directly into the printer to print photos, an instant display screen, a choice of print sizes and quality, and an ergonomic design.

My only criticism would be the placement of the display screen (it becomes easily smudged by fingers and nose), and the battery drainage.  I find myself using the A/C adaptor more often than not.

I used the camera for our family Christmas portrait and received numerous positive comments.  Family and friends were under the impression it has been done by a  professional.  I think that speaks volumes more for the Panasonic ipalm than my photography skills.
