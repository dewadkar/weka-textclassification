            What A GREAT CAR !!! I have no idea why the original owners sold this car.  I purchased it for $11,600 with 54,000
miles.  The car is gloss black 4cyl. with a light grey interior and really looks sharp.  To date I have almost 130,000 miles on this cruiser, and have had minimal problems, except for the usual stuff like replacing the battery, tires, timing belt and reg belts.  I try to get the oil changed every 3000-3500 miles and never have had an ounce of problem with the engine.  The only problem that I have experienced with the car is that when it rains, water gets into the tail light section but drains out when i pop the trunk.  Also the last time I took it to the dealer, they told me the front axle boots had to be replaced, And just one other thing, the power windows driver and pass side both broke, and were costly to fix.  But the engine and everything else on this car has served me more that well !!!  This car is like an ever-ready battery it keeps going and going and has a time tested style!  Even the new Camry's look smaller and less attractive (m.o) than the '92-'96's <br><br>
