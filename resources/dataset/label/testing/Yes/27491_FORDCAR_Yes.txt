            Although the 1995 Ford Probe SE I purchased in 1997 was below book value when I bought it I took a severe beating in the spring of 97 when Ford announced they weren't going to make the Probe anymore. Instantly the value of my car dropped almost $3000 and I was doomed to be upside down on my loan. Not withstanding that...

The Probe is a sporty (everybody loves it) economical (the SE gets 30 mpg)fun (sunroof, stereo, fast, etc) and practical (great car for single person or childless couple). I would recommend it to anyone who is in the market for a car for a high school/college student, young single professional, or young/old couple. BUT, if you have a child then you can go ahead and scratch this one off the list. 

If you need a carseat you will have to have the seats in the all the way forward and straight up position. There won't be any room to move and you will feel extremely cramped. Not a good idea!

Overall, a great car. I have had NO problems with it and think it may be the best used car I have owned. Now that I have a child, it is for sale...and takers?<br><br>
