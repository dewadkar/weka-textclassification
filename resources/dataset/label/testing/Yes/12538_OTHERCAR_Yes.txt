            <i>This is a highly belated entry for the Roadiem write-off, for which I apologize...</i>


This past year I was fortunate enough to be blessed with a Black Chevrolet Silverado 1500HD baby. After the minor heart attack over the price tag, we began a love affair that's still ongoing today. 

<b><i>Just the facts, ma'am.</b></i>

This truck features the Vortec 4800 V8 SFI engine, which hauls butt with 270 horsepower @ 5200 rpm and shows its strength with 285 lb.-ft. of torque @ 4000 rpm. My options include the extended cab, power windows/door locks, the stock stereo (which I cannot really review since I subsequently pulled it out and installed a custom one), and an automatic 4-speed transmission. 

<b><i>Get some room!</b></i>

The cab itself is spacious, and roomy with more than enough room for 4 adults, a tad more cramped with 5, and violating everybody's personal space with 6. I did not opt for the bucket seats, but the seats are a lovely cloth and more than comfortable enough for a road trip or a jaunt around town. The only problem I've encountered is the same one <b>meli</b> encountered in her review. Occasionally the passenger seat belt tries to strangle me. Fixed by unbuckling it and buckling it again, but still, it isn't the best feeling. 

<b><i>What I don't like</b></i>

Besides the price which had the dealer bringing out the smelling salts (I've never bought a big truck before, and that nearly did me in...), I'm not entirely happy with how close my truck sits to the ground. I come from California, where people adore raising their trucks, so I'm partial to that as well. All in all, it's not bad. I don't scrape the ground or anything, and I've got more than enough height to clear curbs that I accidentally mow down. (Did I mention I'm not used to the size of it yet?) My only other gripe, is the plastic piece that sits under the metal front bumper. I'm not entirely sure why Chevy decided to add this, but I've knocked it off 3 times when it hits the curb when I park. For $75 a pop, Chevy will gladly reattach it, but it's truly not worth it. I finally just kicked it off last time, and tossed it in the bed, and my truck looks totally normal even without it. The only other real problem I've encountered is the gigantic blind spot that I have due to a truck box on the back. This problem is solved with the addition of those little "bubble mirror" add-ons, but still not complete visibility.

<b><i>What I Really Like</b></i>

Despite getting the stock stereo system, the speakers are loud enough to suit even my taste, and are great for the average user. I enjoy the color-coded fluids under the hood of the truck, so I'm never worrying about having to struggle to locate anything, for a quick addition. My truck is very quiet on the road, which can lead to the problem of going over the speed limit rather easily. The digital message board on the panel of the truck, reminds me when I'm low on fuel, need an oil change, or if my truck's vastly unhappy about something. This is a good bonus if you're too busy to remember to change your oil, etc. The truck will remind you :) The air conditioning is wonderful, as is the heating, with hell-like conditions possible with the heater, and arctic-like conditions possible with the A/C and everything in between. My truck gets wonderful gas mileage, (nearly the same as my Saturn for mpg!)

<b><i>In Conclusion..</b></i>

All in all, though the price nearly killed me, my baby was  
worth every penny. I look forward to many years of towing, hauling, and cruising around town. I'll let you all know if that seatbelt issue ever gets resolved :)
