            I bought the 1996 4Runner right when it came out (All new 3rd Generation 4Runner) and have been happy from the day I bought it. The 4Runner SR5 has great power, accelerates quickly and never feels the least bit sluggish. Also, the braking is smooth, without mushy or soft feeling pedals. The engine in the SR5 is a nice 183 HP V6 that is very quiet, and has smooth acceleration. The 4WD mechanism is also nice, you can manually switch to 4WD low or high.

The 4Runner has been totally reliable since I bought it, over 4 years ago. I have only taken  it to the shop for routine stuff (except for the oil changes that I do myselfï¿½easily done because you can slide under the vehicle without  lifting the car, thanks to the great ground clearance.

Another thing I love is the cargo space in the rear. It has the most cargo of any Japanese built mid-size SUV, and maybe second only to the Dodge Durango (which is the largest of the mid-size SUVs, and maybe the newer Grand Cherokees). 

The 4Runner has very comfortable rear leg room as well, even when  compared to the Infiniti QX4 (Nissan Pathfinder derived.) 

Perhaps the only complaints I have about the 96 4Runner have already been addressed. The sliding temperature controls in the center panel (now replaced with dials or electronic touch controls) were a bit too truck like for me. The shocks are a bit harsh over speedbumps when compared to some sedans, but otherwise just right.

Overall, the 4Runner is a fine SUV, great power, and consistently a highly rated SUV. It drives smoothly and you should have  no qualms in getting into this SUV!
