            In the market for a used car, a car that will get through the next few years with minimum problems and a trusted name?  Avoid The Plymouth Sundance.  One year ago just before the summer of 1998 I bought my first car, a cute, easy to handle Plymouth Sundance Duster  sport coupe,  It had been made in 1992 and had hardly been used. The Duster had been taken off the market shortly after it's debut in 1992, but this meant nothing to me, now I know I should have looked into it more.  The first few months of owning the car were fine,  But after about 6 months the trouble started, small things with the fan belt then finally 7 months after buying my cute little car the transmission died for good.  It would cost $1000 to replace the trans and I had even finished paying for the car itself yet.  So that was it, bye bye car.  I felt I had wasted my hard earned dollors and never forgave myself.  <br><br>
