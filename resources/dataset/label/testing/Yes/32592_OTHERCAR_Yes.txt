            I have seen all the advertisements about the Saturn family.  I must agree that they are a little disappointing to watch.  I own one, but it seems like all the elderly, boring suburban people do too.  I mean who really wants to be driving grandma's car?  But now that I have it, I have grown to love it.  I really can't complain because my parents' bought it for me. I got to choose the color, though.  I picked black so that it would seem less like the boring car it appears.  My parents own the station-wagon looking one in gold.  See what I mean?  I know Saturns are not BMWs, Porsches, Mercedes, Rovers, Explorers...they are Saturns.  But they are a wonderful breed in their own.  Comfortable on the inside.  Normal-looking on the out. They drive smoothly. Handle easily. And the best part...it costs about $10 to fill the entire tank!  How many cars can say that!?!  I can drive from San Diego to San Luis Obispo with some gas still in my tank!  Saturns are actually the ideal car for students, parents, and anyone else who likes to save the extra buck.<br><br>
