            I want to be brief and succinct with this review. If you are thinking about buying this camera, then there is a definite reason. The reason doesn&#146t include zoom, or shutter speeds, or macro distance. The reason you are thinking about buying this camera is that it&#146s small.

I have a Nokia 8260. This phone isn&#146t as long, but slightly wider and deeper in case you want to get a feel for its size.

And it fits nicely in my pocket. The camera is designed to be operated with one hand, you can slide open the shutter as you&#146re taking it out of your pocket and press the button with the same hand. Boot up time takes less than half a second. This concept was one of the main selling points for me: It not only fit in my pocket, but was designed specifically for the person that would be carrying it around in a pocket.

Picture modes aren&#146t anything special, just basic effects you can find out on the website. Flash modes and scene modes are great though and can be set by pressing the up and down scroll buttons respectively. But the scene modes are great, designed for portraits, un-backlit scenes and landscapes. All three have given me impressive pictures, especially the un-backlit mode. Both flash and scene modes get lost when the camera is powered down.

The shutter powers up or powers down the camera. But, there is also a power button that lets you turn it on with the shutter closed.

This camera has been everywhere when I need it and has given me great pictures. I find the burst and movie modes useless and I take all my pictures in 640x480 because I just use them to stick in iPhoto. 80 pictures seems great for the built-in memory.

This isn&#146t a camera designed to take stunning pictures, it&#146s a camera designed to be used spur of the moment, to have with you wherever you go, to capture memories for yourself, not for art. Anything that I&#146ve left out can be found on Sony&#146s website, I&#146m just trying to convey my unique experience.
