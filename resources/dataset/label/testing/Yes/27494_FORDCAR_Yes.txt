            Last winter, my parents got my brother and I a car to cruise around the town in.  Well, maybe I shouldn't say my brother and I because it is his car, but I get to drive it every once in a while.  Anyway, it happened to be a 1995 Ford Probe.  In the year or so we've had it, we have had absolutely no problems with it.  It has about 70,000 miles on it, but it still runs extremely well.  It handles well on the turns, and in inclement weather (we previously had a '91 Probe, and it slipped all over the road in ice.  I think the '95 has a wider base, so its more stable), and it gets fairly good gas mileage (around 22 miles a gallon).  

Now, my family was lucky because we found this car for $2,000 under the blue book price, so it has been an extremely good deal for us.  Anyway, i think this car would be good for students and young adults because it isn't horribly expensive, and it is rather attractive.  So, if you are on the lookout for a used car, the 1995 Ford Probe is an excellent automobile.<br><br>
