            There are many great automobiles to choose from.The dodge stratus is one of the best.I own a stratus and I love it.It handles well and is smooth riding no matter what terrain you are driving in.It grabs the road and corners good.Excellent brakink sysyem and its low profile slender style is excellent in holding it to the road.Inside it is comfortable and roomy.The sound system can noy be beat.The customer service at the dodge dealers is also a plus.So if you want a great car at a good price go and test drive one.you will be gad you did.The engine is smooth and quiet.great air conditioning and heat.Several different styles of interiors and plenty of over the head room.I love the low sleek style.Comes in any color you want.<br><br>
