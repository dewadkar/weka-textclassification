            Audi A4 sedan 2003

Audi Ups the Ante.

The Audi A4 is certainly one of the most popular model this manufacturer produces and to keep ahead of the competition in this class, Audi has made some improvements for the year 2003 models.

They have given the A4 a more powerful engine that will develop 170 horsepower an increase of 20 horsepower over the previous year model.

The A4 is offered in two style, the four door sedan and the very attractive cabriolet.

In the interior you will notice a new three-spoke leather steering wheel has been added to improve the look and for safety an extra sideguard head area airbag that when triggered covers the entire side window area thus giving maximum protection to the head of the occupant.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Audi A4 sedan is a very well designed automobile. The A4 comes equipped with a long list of standard luxury features and also a long list of safety equipment. 

For the consumer that is looking for a sportier A4, a performance package is offered with options such as a firmer sport suspension, a stronger rear stabilizer bar, very sporty looking ten spokes alloyed wheels and top performance tires.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior:

I was little disappointed after my first glance of the inside of the A4; the seats were not leather. When I asked if they were available and I was told that leather seats were not even available as an option, which surprised me even more.

From the driver&#146s position you have an excellent all around vision. It was fairly easy to locate a comfortable seat setting and the interior rear view mirror plus the two side view mirrors will give the driver an excellent view of on coming traffic.

The driver has a clear site of all the gauges and the control buttons are all within easy reach. 

The A4 comes equipped with the following standard features, air conditioning, power windows, mirrors and locks, cruise control, tilt steering heated seat, AM/FM radio cassette, rear window defroster and alloy wheels.

Another small disappointment was the fact that a CD player is only available as an option. When you know that certain manufacturer that sell their sedan at half the price and include a CD player as standard equipment you would think that Audi could also do the same.

The leg and headroom in the front is acceptable, it is a little restricted in the back seat but good enough.

The exterior:

From the exterior the A4 is a beautiful automobile, only one small thing I would have liked and that is to see more chrome. But this is a personal taste I have with cars.

The trunk space is at 13.7 cubic feet, which is about average for a sedan that size.
