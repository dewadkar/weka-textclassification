            I bought my Sunbird a little over a year ago and at first I loved it.  I have the V-6 in mine so it is pretty fast but I also get bad gas mileage.  I really hate the dash speakers, they are only 3.5's and there are 6x9's in the back.  What this ends up doing is putting all of your sound in the backseat, meaning you have to turn the stereo up louder to hear it in the front (if you still want the bass from the back speakers).  All of this leads to blowing speakers.  I also am having issues with my interior.  My dashboard rattles like crazy because it is falling, my door panels and the windows in my doors rattle like crazy and the passenger seat is extremely hard to slide forward and backward.  Most of these problems are probably due to the chronic shaking of the front end and the very bumpy ride I get from my car.  What I do like about the car is the way it looks.  The factory alloy rims are in great condition, there is no rust or bondo anywhere on the car and the spoiler gives it a sporty touch.  The only problem I have had with the engine was replacing the water pump which was very cheap and easy ($20 and an hour of my time).
