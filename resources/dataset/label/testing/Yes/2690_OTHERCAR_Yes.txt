            I flew into Washington DC one day to find out that I had to go out on assignment for a month without notice and drive all over the western US and &quot;visit&quot; people.

My only option was to rent a vehicle.  I ended up with a beautiful 2000 Mountaineer AWD with a V-8 in it.  I was thinking cool.

I drove this vehicle on &amp; off road in the snow, in the swamps and on the freeways.  It was a great vehicle, just enough power to move around.  The contorls were great, sound system superb..CD player never skipped a beat.  The seats were comfortable and never gave me a back ache.  Getting in and out was easy...the running boards helped.  Put no adults in the back seat.  A few passengers said that it felt like a bench at a bus stop.  I tried it, and agreed.

I put 11,000 hard miles on this car in a month.  It was a pleasure; however, the only bad thing was that I only got 13 miles to the gallon overall.  There was a lot of idling involved; however, my Crown Victoria, in similar comparison got 17 and my S70 would do 23 in the same situation.  My best tank in the Mountaineer was about 15 MPG.

The benefits far outweighed the consequences.  There were a few parts of the trip where having a SUV really helped.

If you need to haul around large loads, need trailer towing capacity and full time AWD, this is the car.  If you are stingy on gas, get a compact SUV.  If I was to buy a SUV, this would be the one, pending how my wallet feels.<br><br>
