            I have recently purchased a J30T with moderate miles. I shopped for a car that was looked after and paid more for it. As a former Auto Technician I know what to look for and what to expect yet every time I drive this car I say to my self "Dam thatï¿½s a great car" (and Yes I truly do). 
The car affords a level of style and comfort that is beyond compare for the price. I had looked at a number of J30's with some having covered 160K miles - I checked them to see where the problems show. They were great other than just basic owner neglect.

The car is extremely quiet and smooth yet does not distance itself from a mild degree of sportiness. Performance is smooth yet impressive yet the power is well handled by braking and suspension systems of similar refinement.
The appointments available with the car were somewhat sparse yet the standard of quality and functionality were apparent. The Bose sound system for example has remarkable output and clarity without all the fancy dials. 
My only complaint (after 15k miles) is a lack of fold down rear seating and slightly high fuel consumption.

I went from driving a Porsche to the Infiniti and feel it was a step up in style and understated performance.
