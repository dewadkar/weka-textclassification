            This car handles well on the highway and around town. It doesn't stall on cold mornings and behaves like a luxury car in that  its easy handling makes driving easier and enjoyable.  The braking is smoothed and controlled.  And acceleration is there at a moments notice when you need a little more speed. This car is idea for around town use ad trips out of town.  I have not had any problems with it mechanically or with its electronics since I have owned it.  I just take it in for regular maintenance ie: oil change, fluid check, brake inspection, tune up, etc. and I plan to use it to take my vacation in this spring.    Inside the car is comfortable. The climate control is easy to adjust.  This is important.  When you own a car you want to be able to drive it without being uncomfortable.  In addition to the climate control the seats are easily adjusted as well as the steering wheel.  Of all the cars that I've owned the the Mercury Mystic has been the most reliable and practical.<br><br>
