            My husband gave me the most wonderful gift last year.  A big, shiny PURPLE Plymouth Grand Voyager Mini van!!! I was ecstatic!  I still am, too.  It has the dual sliding doors, which although I have 3 kids, they STILL seem to only use one of those doors. 

 In the center of the van, is the half bench seat.  It has two built in Child safety harnesses.  Wow!  What a fantastic idea.  I am gushing over this feature in particular. 

 I have 2 children who still need the harness.  One is 7 years old, but small, so he doesn't want to be in a &quot;baby seat&quot;.  This way, he is safe, and not embarrassed. 

 My 3 year old loves it because it doesn't make him look different from his older brother and sister.  He feels more like a &quot;big boy&quot;.  I love it because it is SO easy to get them in and out. 

I just open one of the dual sliding doors, and there he is..right there.  No bending, no climbing, no scrunching myself up to get the child out.  Best of all, I don't have to worry about whether or not I got the Child seat installed correctly.  

The engine is only a 3.0.  However, for me and my uses, it is fine.  My husband would have preferred to get a more powerful engine for me, but to be perfectly  honest, I don't think it is necessary.  I drive the heck out of this van,  from home to the kids school, to karate practice, to my parents house 2 hrs. away.

No problems with the engine power, and in the words of my husband, &quot;This thing SIPS gas!&quot;  His mini van has a much larger engine, and uses a LOT more gas than mine does.

The van feels safe to me.  I feel safe driving my precious cargo around town, and on trips, too.  To me, that is the absolute best recommendation I can give.  Plus, it's a cute van....come on, It's purple!!
