              *********MY BACK TAIL LIGHT BULBS KEPT GOING OUT. I FOUND OUT THAT ON SEVERAL MALIBU'S, THAT THE PLASTIC BASE ON THE BULBS WERE MELTING AND CAUSING THE BULB TO STOP WORKING. an INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION WAS TO GET SPECIAL BULBS THAT HAVE A GLASS BASE. NOW THEY WORK GREAT. YOU CAN GET THEM AT ANY AUTO STORE! SO FAR I HAVE COUNTED 21 MALIBU'S THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!!!!******

  I love my 1999 Malibu. I needed to replace my 1988 Corsica last Dec. so got the Malibu. I love the Left handed Cup holder, the back seat cup holder, the speed adjusting radio volume, the automatic head light that turn on at night and off during the day. Also I like the power, and it's just an all around GREAT CAR!! And unlike most cars, the bumpers are sturdy. One time I came out of a Walmart and a car had pulled in to far and was pushing in my front bumper. When I backed up the bumper popped back out and there was no damage. That's a good feature to have o aging cars. But I have one other problem. 
 I  had trouble with the ignition system. It kept shutting off my car.It was caused by a short in the PassLock(R) security system. It was covered on my warranty so there no problem there. so i DEFINITELY say get this CAR!!<br><br>
