            When looking for a Digital camera, I looked at many many cameras. The Sony MVC-FD91 has everything I wanted and more. Sony is a well known and respected electronics manufacurer. The MVC-FD91 has Still picture and Video capability. The camera has zoom, built in flash, microphone, autofocus and the most important feature in my opionion was the use of the 3 1/2&quot; disc to hold the pictures. This allows you to take your pictures to almost any computer and view and print what you have just done without and special cable hookups.  Try one out today,  you won't be disipointed <br><br>
