            Well, I wrote about falling in love with this car when I saw a picture of it.  Then I saw it in real life and it reinforced my feelings.  

I had one on order and my dealer called and told me that one had come in comparably equipped to the one I ordered and in the same color.  I got it 4-6 weeks EARLY!  

I never drove it until I drove it off the dealer lot and I can say it is FUN! The pickup is peppy for a 4 cylinder and the amenities are great.  I have the moon (or sun) roof.  The stereo and speakers sound great and the stations are easy to set. 

There are pockets all over the place and cup holders. The horn even has a cute, but serious, sound. It is very easy to park and get into and out of. 

I have had several people approach me and ask me about it.  People are just infatuated with this car! 

I think I will get many years of service and enjoyment out of it.   <br><br>
