            We bought the CRV before it was shipped from Japan back around Feb97. So when the first Shipment came we were there when the Truck got there.

We had another car that we had a lot of problems with and we were about to have our fist child in April so we wanted something a little bigger and reliable.

Our choice was between the Toyota Rav4 and the CRV. Our friend bought a RAV4 and we were surprised at how small it was. I had been doing research on the Internet on the CRV and from all the spec we had seen it looked like a better deal.

After about 3 years of owning the CRV we are as happy with it now as we were when we bought it. I would recommend it to anyone who asked and since we were the first ones in our area with one 3 years ago we were asked a lot.

It is fun to drive we have taken it to the mountains on dirt roads and the 4 wheel drive worked great. I realize this is not a serious off road SUV but for the once or twice a year we take it off road it has been wonderful to drive and for the price nothing comes close to the value you get with the CRV
