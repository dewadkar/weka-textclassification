            We purchased this wonderful car about 8 months ago. It has been a joy to own and drive. It is very roomy and fun. It has nice styling and meets all of my expectations. 

We have had no trouble with this car, no noises, nothing. The only real con that I can think of was the experience in buying it new from the Mazda dealer. (JN Mazda in Honolulu) We really felt cheated and ripped off. 

However, we have moved on and are enjoying our new Mazda. 

We own the LX edition, but wish we had purchased the one with the larger engine. Sometimes in a full car it feels slightly underpowered, but that was the trade off we got for the excellent fuel economy. We usually get 35 MPG from our combination of city and freeway driving.

I now own two Mazda vehicles, a 2000 Protege and a 1995 Miata.
