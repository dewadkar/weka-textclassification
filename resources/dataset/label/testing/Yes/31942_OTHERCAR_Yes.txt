            A New Millenia for the Millennium.

For 2002, Mazda took their top selling luxury sedan and improved it in and out. Some of the changes are easy to notice while others are a little discrete.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

On the exterior body, Mazda has restyled most of the front of the Millenia giving a newly designed front hood, front fenders, bumper, headlights and a new grill. All this restyling gives the 2002 Millenia a much sleeker look. They did some changes in the rear of the car also by changing the taillights and rear fascia.

For the interior they have the biggest change is that they have given it a new two-color styling. Sometimes two colors interior in certain car can be awful looking. Certain automakers have great designers while others are not so good. For Mazda, I must say that their designers have put out a superior two-color scheme, even to the small details such as matching interior lights and steering wheel assembly.

The not so obvious changes are with the structure of the frame; they have reinforced it thus giving the 2003 Millenia better handling and quieter drive.

THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR

The interior: 

If there is one part of this fine automobile that sets a part from all the competitors in its class, it has to be its fantastic interior.

The 2002 Millenia comes equipped with all the bells and whistle you would find in a car twice the cost. There is only one trim of the Millenia and it is loaded.

Once I opened the driver&#146s side front door, I immediately smelled the brand new leather that covers the seats and side door panels of this fine automobile. I sat in the driver&#146s seat with no problem since the Millenia front seat slides back automatically once the engine is turned off. 

The front seat has a multiple powered adjustment so it did not take very long to find a comfortable position.  I also took the time to adjust the mirrors and then I realized that I was in a fine luxury automobile.

The leather that covered the seat seats, the dashboard, the door panels and the steering wheel was first class quality. The workmanship was also exceptional.

The all around vision from the driver&#146s seat was excellent and all the gauges and control buttons are within easy reach of the driver.

Of there is only one thing I did not care for too much about the interior of the Millenia, is the low ceiling it has in both the front and the rear, but aside from this you will have ample legroom and a very comfortable ride whether you are in the front or back seat of this car.

As I mentioned above the Millenia comes not only withy a full compliment of comfort standard feature but also with a long list of safety features. 

I will start with the list of comfort features the car I had the pleasure to test drive had: It had air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, Leather seats, heated front seats, AM/FM cassette radio with CD player, a nine speakers BOSE system, a sun roof, rear window defroster and alloy wheels.

The list of safety standard equipment will follow later.

I have to admit that the Millenia I test-drove, was certainly one of the most comfortable car I sat in, in a long time.

The exterior:

I like the new re-styled look of the 2002 Millenia. it gives it a sleeker and refine appearance.

The paint job on the exterior body was flawless.

The cargo volume at only 13 cubic feet is a little small for what would want to call a full size sedan, but this is not a major issue for a car that looks so good.
