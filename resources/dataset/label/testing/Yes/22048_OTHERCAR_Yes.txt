            I am not a great photographer, It is possible to review my pictures after taking them and delete the ones that didn't turn out so good.  That's the camera for me.  The Kodak DC215 Zoom Digital Camera, was the camera I chose.

No more waiting until the film is  processed to find out how many good pictures I took. In the long run I have saved money by transferring them to my computer and printing them on quality paper instead of sending them out to be developed.  The camera would make an excellent gift, or take pictures, blow them up, touch them up buy a frame or photo album and there you have it a priceless treasure any parent or family member would love.    

It is reasonably priced, about mid range in comparison to other digital cameras and has accessories included in the price.  Enough to get you started.  You will want to buy more, at least another memory card.

It is light weight, runs on 4 double AA batteries, automatic flash mode with a self-timer and date stamp.

It has a digital print output file and memory card.

The view screen is a little small, but workable. 

It is possible to transfer your pictures right onto your computer and email, print them or hook up your camera to the television and give a slide show.  

You can purchase rechargeable batteries and a charger, this camera uses up batteries fast.

You can program it to do a lot of things, adjust the LCD brightness, quality, time, flash, exposure and customize your picture.

I have had my digital camera for almost a year and still learning how to use it properly, I am ok at it, I just haven't master everything yet.

It is a good little camera with very few flaws. Great for someone who is just getting started or someone who has everything.<br><br>
