            Buick Riviera is the bomb!

  This luxurious, almost sport, vehicle is top of the line when it comes
to looks, performance, space, and safety.
  The 3800, 3.8 litre V-6 engine (with about 205 horsepower) will rock 
your world on the road. You can add about 65 more horsepower with the 
optional factory supercharger for a price of about $1,200.00, well worth it. The car also features optional traction control, heated driver-side
seat, dual memory seat positions and mirror positions, factory security system, compact-disc and cassette stereo receiver with excellent sounding
speaker system, cornering lamps, dual exhaust, leather seats, 3-way universal remote (garage door opener, etc.), and a trunk that would 
fit close to five adults with the lid shut.
  Another thing that's great about the Riviera is the insurance rate, very
inexpensive. It has driver and passenger side air-bags, child safety locks and computer chips in the keys as part of the theft-deturrant
system.
   I love my Riviera in and out. It's the best car I've ever owned. It's
interior is sleek and comfortable, It's body looks like an over-sized
sport car and it's engine make me feel like I'm driving a race car.
        I feel like King of the road!
