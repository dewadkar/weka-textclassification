            I bought this camera as i was moving out of the country and wanted to send pictures back home. It is everything I wanted in a digital camera and much more. I feel that the salespeople are woefully inadequate in try to inform the public on these things. Not once could anyone adequately answer my questions at the stores. After buying 3 cameras and returning them, I decided on the 2.1 mega pixel camera. I didn't know whether to buy a 2.1 mp or go for the 3.3 model. I decided to stay simple. I don't know what kind of pictures the 3.3 cameras produce, but most of the time, i don't even use the highest quality mode, the meduim quality produces great clear pictures. I have printed out many of my pictures on my Lexmark z52 and everyone is very impressed as I am and with good pictures, they turn out just like a photo. I also love the movie mode it comes with. I always wanted a video camera, but who wants to watch 25 minutes of someones vacation? This little thing takes cute videos that can last up to a minute. The swivel screen on it is great, as it allows me to lower the camera and take low level pictures without being on my belly. 

I would highly reccomend this camera to everyone, the prices have dropped and in comparison with the other models, (6 months ago) it compared better than the others and offered me more. I love most sony products and this one has continued to impress. Sony's warranty is short, like 90 days, but i got mine at best buys and got a 4 year warranty for 70 bucks more. All stores are different as far as extended warranty is concerned, so shop around.

The things that you have to have with a digital camera is
a honking big memory stick. At least 64 meg, the high quality mode will gobble up space like no ones business. 

A rechargable lithium battery is wonderful that comes with the camera. I bought an extra, but i have many friends that have digital cameras and the main complaint is that they are buying AA batteries left and write. Don't waste your money on one that doesn't use a good rechargeable batteries. When fully charged, my camera lasts for weeks and then I slip in the other one for a couple of more weeks.

A usb port cable is very important, almsot all new models come with that cable, but don't even think about buying one without it, takes wayyyy too long without it.

I love mine<br><br>
