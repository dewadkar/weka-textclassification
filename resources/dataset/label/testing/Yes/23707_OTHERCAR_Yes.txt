             I haven't previously been much of a foreign car afficianado, but when the time came to get my wife a new car, the measly three year/30,000 mile warranties of most American vehicles wasn't going to work, considering she has
a commute of 56 miles per day just to work. The 30,000 mile
limit would be up in the blink of an eye. A friend of mine had had good luck with an earlier model Kia, and I couldn't help but be intrigued by the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. This warranty isn't quite as good as it sounds, since the 10 year/100,000 coverage is only on the drive train. Nevertheless, you still get 5 years/60,000 bumper to bumper.
 We chose the base model Spectra, which after incentives checked in right around $10,000. The car is actually quite attractive, somewhat akin to a 4-door cavalier. The head and tail lights are particularly striking, as well as the 
grill. The exterior also features fold in mirrors. Tires leave something to be desired, as they are very small and just look cheap. We will probably upgrade these to some better wheels sometime soon.

 While not having an overabundance of options, the Kia has a lot of nice little touches. This particular model has air conditioning, automatic transmission, a nice sounding 4 speaker CD stereo (it seems you have to really crank it up to get the best sound when listening to the radio, however), variable speed delay wipers, rear window defogger, adjustable cup holders and storage areas in the center console, map/reading lights, a sunglasses storage area above the rear view mirror(very handy!), and even adjustable lumbar support for the driver's seat. Not bad at all for the most basic model of the car.

 As far as driving goes, the 1.8 liter DOHC engine has plenty of pep. You won't be doing any drag racing, but the Spectra is quite capable of getting you up that on ramp in a hurry. Brakes seem quite responsive, and my wife just reported the other day that the car did quite well in the 
snow! Steering and suspension are very competent, and the ride is pretty much as smooth as you would expect from a compact, and might even improve with better and bigger tires. Gas mileage is slightly dissapointing, averaging about 26mpg with mixed highway/city driving. However, as another reviewer pointed out, there Spectra just started to break in at about 9,000 miles, and their gas mileage improved to over 30mpg, so maybe the car is just a slow starter.

 As far as interior room, we have had four adults in the car on more than one occasion, and we all fit quite comfortably. I personally am 6'2", 220 lbs. and fit quite nicely in the car. Another feature I like is the cavernous trunk, which is much bigger than anything you would expect to find in a car of this size.
  
 Overall, if you are looking for a dependable, attractive small sedan without a lot of frills, the Spectra definitely fits the bill. It is actually quite classy looking, runs well, and won't put a huge dent in your pocketbook. And, who can argue with the warranty?
