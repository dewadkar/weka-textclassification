            This is an EXCELLENT vehicle for the 4 wheel drive enthusiast, and the grocery-getter.

The styling on this timely classic can't be beat. The only problem I find with this vehicle is the back seat and the back doors, they are TOO SMALL.

This vehicle is excellent for trouncing around in trails, mud, rocks, and snow.

I took this vehicle, before I put a 4.5&quot; lift on it through the trails in Telico, TN. I could not believe how this vehicle handled crawling through the rocks without any modifications to the suspension or differentials (at the time).

This vehicle will get you between 15-20 mpg depending on the way you drive. I drive a bit more aggressively.

It will give you a feeling of overall safety for you and your family.

If you are into Jeep at all, you may want to consider this vehicle.<br><br>
