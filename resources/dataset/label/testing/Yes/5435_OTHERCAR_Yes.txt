            BOTTOM LINE:  If you are looking for an incredible car at a fair (dare I say STEAL)price, put this car on your list!!!

I had been looking for a new car for quite some time.  Originally, I was intending to purchase a used Volkswagon Passat (aka "My Dream Car").  I started doing research (I looked around for about 6 months) on all the cars out there.

The only way I could get a Pasaat was to get it used (wife & I are saving for a house...so priorities dictate not spending $25K for a new car that will depreciate in value).  Looked at used Pasaats, and started getting a bit nervous at the reports I was reading about maintenance costs.  Why should I get a new car only to be forking out money at a repair shop.  I had been there and done that with an '88 Buick Skyhawk I had in college.  No thanks.

Continuing my research I focused in on a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, and the new Elantra GT.  First, believe me when I tell you that Hyundai's are reliable.  You should not worry about this.  Test drive one of their new models -- smooth as silk.  In my opinion the GT drove smoother, more quiet, and felt better (seats, ride, build quality) than the Civic & Corolla.  I know I'll get beat up for that by some reviewer, but that was my impression.

I had owned a 1998 Hyundai Accent as my "commuter car".  No frills, no bells or whistles, just a "point A to B" car.  I had no complaints.  It held up reliably.  So when I test drove the GT I already knew Hyundai had made leaps and bounds in the quality of their cars.

--LOOKS--
The first thing I noticed is that the Elantra GT is unique.  Many people compare it to a Saab due to it's hatchback.  This is true.  Some like the front, some do not.  I particularly think the car -- front, back, side, you name it -- looks great.  It's classy and sporty.  Everyone on the road does a double take when you drive it.  I live in Atlanta (SUV land, as I call it), and there are very few on the road.  I personally like the fact that not every other person has this car right now.

--BUILD QUALITY--
This is where I wanted to focus.  Doors and hatchback slam shut with an authorative "Whuuuump!".  Tires are Michelins (with alloy wheels...No ghastly plastic hubcaps!).  Everything passes my inspection.  

--INTERIOR--
This is where you will first see HOW MUCH CAR you are getting for the price!  It's phenomenal.  LEATHER SEATING! Gauges that Light Up Purple & Red (like Volkswagon) at night.  REAL Cup & Bottle-Sized Holders.  Central Storage Console for CDs, change, you name it.  Here is where the Elantra GT moves beyond the Civic & Corolla.  To get these options on those cars you'll be paying thousands more!  

--THE HATCHBACK'S ROOMINESS--
My wife & I wanted a roomy car.  The Elantra GT is labled "sub-compact," but by no means is.  The cabin is very roomy. Just as roomy as my wife's '91 Honda Accord.
You could easily fit 4 Adults on a long road trip (5 max on a short trip to the games, concert, etc).  Now the back cargo area the hatchback affords is just as big as an SUV! In fact, BIGGER, than some of the smaller ones that are out now!  We can load it up for trips; lug all of our work-related gear; travel with our dog; make trips to the hardware store...ANYTHING!  You truly do get the best of both worlds -- the utility & room of an average-sized SUV's cargo area; but you also get GREAT Gas Mileage vs. an SUV!

--PERFORMANCE--
I knew you wanted to know this!  The Elantra GT (GT stands for "Grand Touring") is not a sports car.  If Hyundai gave it another 65 hp, then we could be talking.  As is, the GT has 140 hp.  This is MORE than what you get with the Civic and the Corolla!  Do yourself a favor, test drive this vehicle.  You truly will be amazed how smooth it is, and how great it drives.  I have no worries about driving in Atlanta's notorious traffic with this car.  You feel completely safe & confident passing.  The drive is quiet (no squeaks, rattles, or other noises at all!).

--SAFETY--
I opted for the ABS (Package 11, which brings the price up $1,000).  The car does, however, come STANDARD with Dual Front & Side Airbags.  My wife & I like the added benefit of the ABS & Traction Control.

Yes, I read Consumer Reports IIHSA info regarding crash tests.  I also read the NHTSA results which scored excellent.  My bottom line is this.  I would never, ever purchase a car that will have my wife and I in it where I did not feel 100% safe.  In my mind, the best safety is to drive responsibly and alert.  Keep safe distances between your car and others on the highway, and know how to react & handle your car in emergency situations.  The benefit of ABS, side & front air bags are added insurance.  You want to be able to walk away from an accident.  Bottom Line, I feel SAFE in this car!

--PRICE--
This is also phenomenal.  This car, which comes STANDARD with leather, power everything, keyless entry, security alarm, etc. costs thousands less than every other car that does *not* offer these amenities.

Before tax, title, and fees my price came to $15,654 (remember, I opted for the highest package on mine & that bumped up the price $1,000).  I left the lot driving with a big, dumb grin -- not one ounce of "Buyer's Remorse".  I believe if everyone started test driving this model, they would start raising the price on this car because it is a DREAM!!! A Steal is an understatement.

--WARRANTY--
You know about the warranty.  10 years.  I won't bore you with the details.  The way this car is built, I doubt you'll even need it.  It's that good!  But...if you ever do, isn't it nice to know you won't be paying outrageous costs?

--COMPETITION--
I see the immediate competition as:
*Mazda Protege5
*Volkswagon Golf
*Honda Civic Si
*Toyota Matrix
*Pontiac Vibe

You're going to get the car you feel comfortable in, and the style you truly love.  The cars above, to me, had a look I could see myself growing tired of within a year.  The drives and reliability are all comparable, if not subpar to the Elantra GT.  But, IMHO, the GT looks like a million bucks.  It doesn't look like a boxy wagon.  It looks like a much more expensive automobile (OK, Saab comparison again :).   I can see myself driving this car for the next 8 years easy.  The utility, roominess, reliability and features puts it way ahead of the competition.  

--RESALE VALUE--
Another big factor for anyone preparing to purchase an automobile.  Listen, right up front, if you are going to be getting a new car every 2 years I think you should get a "big name" so you can salvage some of your money during the trade.  If that's what you want to do, go with Honda or Toyota.  If, like me, you make a longterm purchase and plan to truly drive your car at least 5 years then GO WITH THIS CAR!  You will not get more car for your money.  Ever!

Yes, when 5, 8, or 10 years comes around and you want to trade it in you will probably get less than a Honda or Toyota.  You know what?  I would prefer saving 5 grand now, investing it and actually earning some interest instead of patting myself on the back for how smart I was to buy a more expensive auto.  Remember, ALL autos depreciate. You'll either save your money up front or get a little chunk o' change back at your trade in.  It is your choice.  

--FINAL THOUGHTS--

PROS:
-Price!
-Leather Interior
-Hatchback Cargo Space (comparable to SUV!)
-Luxury style amenities (purple gauges, cabin storage, more leather!)
-Remote Keyless Entry
-Security Alarm
-Smooth, Quiet Ride
-Power (for non NASCAR wannabes)

CONS
-Resale value (we've covered that above...)
-Wish it had an additional light in cargo area (is that "nitpicky" or what?!?!)

If you are reading this, you are likely considering the car.  GO FOR IT!  Go directly to GT, since you get so much more for the money.  One test drive and you will forget every concern you've ever had about Hyundai.  This is the milestone model.  One review stated that buyers should "purchase this car before they raise the price to $30 Grand!"  One drive & you will agree.
