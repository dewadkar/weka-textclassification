            I bought this car for a cross country road trip with a bunch of music gear, and the layout for lugging stuff is great, but the car really is quite underpowered. It's better for carrying stuff around town than serious cross-country drives. It's well-built otherwise, and nicely designed --I've been a Honda owner for twenty years and this one is definitely part of the line. The back seats are far less comfortable than the front (although they do recline pretty far back, which is a nice feature), and the passenger seat lacks an armrest, which is very odd. I also wish there was more storage within easy reach of the driver. There's a drawer under the passenger seat, but it's totally inaccessible while driving.

If you're looking for an SUV that's pretty close to a car in weight and handling, and that is well engineered for carrying lots of stuff in it's relatively small space, it's a great choice. But crossing the Great Divide was pretty rough going, doesn't make you feel sporty at all! <br><br>
