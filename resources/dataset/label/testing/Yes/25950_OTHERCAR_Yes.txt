            My wife likes two kinds of cars: sporty and those great big tanks that older people typically drive.  The Grand Am was the best compromise we could find.  The car is actually categorized as a compact, but there's nothing compact about it.  It is a roomy car that maintains a sporty appearance.

We found ours at a Used Auto Dealer and settled the deal for $13,000.  This was a great deal considering that it was an SE, but included upgrades such as CD player, alloy wheels, and spoiler.  The best part: 9400 miles.  Someone else depreciated it so we could appreciate it!

I highly recommend this car if your looking for something sporty, but practical.<br><br>
