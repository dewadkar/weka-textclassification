            When Canon introduced their G1-camera for some time ago, it quickly became one of the most beloved cameras on the market. It was the "Best in Test", camera in several magazines, and later the G2 was given the same recognition. It was also given the "Best New Camera of the year" award in Europe. 

G3 is the new top model in Canons digital compact-camera serie. It is an advanced camera which is best suited for enthusiasts and proffesional use. Price-wise the camera is a lot cheaper than the G2 was at its introduction, which means that the man-in-the-street may find this camera interesting.

The camera uses a 4 Megapixel CCD-chip, by the way the same as in the G2. It produces pictures with a resolution of 2,272 x 1,704 pixels (all together 3.87 million active pixels). The lens is new, and the optical zoom is enhanced from 3x to 4x. Combined with a digital zoom, it totals up to 14x. The soundless zoom covers the area between 35-140mm, compared to 32-104mm in the G2. The pictures (JPEG/RAW) are saved to a compact flash card, type I or II (incl. IBM microdrive). A 32MB card is included.

Macrophotographs have never been Canons biggest strength. G3 has been given a very much improved macrofunctionality compared to its predecessor, and with full wideangle, you can now take sharp pictures all the way down to about 2" away from the motive. 

The G3 can also record video with sound (motion JPEG/AVI), and the clips can last up to 3 minutes (15 frames per second). 

The G3 has a traditional construction, and is more "square"-like compared to the G2. The front and the top is in metal, while the back is in plastic. On the top you will find a LCD-panel, which provides you with the information you need of you decide not to use the LCD-screen on the back of the camera. There is also a flash-port here, if you want to use an external flash. The Zoom-control lies wrapped around the trigger, and is also controlled with your right index-finger.

Between the flash-port and the trigger, you will find a button that will let you choose from a "serie-triggering" ( 2, 3 pictures per sec.) or a "self-triggering" function(2-10 second). Right behind this button, the on/off-button is placed. It is a little button that needs to be pushed and then turned to either direction for the on/off effect. The placement of this button is very clumsy. If you use the optical-seeker your forehead will easily crash with the on/off button, and may easily become irritating. 

Behind the trigger lies the function wheel, which lets you choose between different settings on the camera.

On the backside there is a number of buttons, which lets you control normal settings like, flash, macro, white-balance, exposure and manual focus. The other buttons control the menu, which is in known, userfriendly Canon style. The 1.8" fold-out LCD-screen is of very high quality. I have had no problems using it even under difficult outdoor conditions (sun and snow).

The camera is very comfortable in your hand, and even if it weighs almost half a kg, an almost perfect grip makes it easy to control the functions by using only one hand. 

<b>Conclusion</b>

Totally the G3 has a very complete construction. The annoying on/off button makes it almost impossible to use the optical-seeker, so you have to use the LCD-screen insted. Maybe that was intended to?
