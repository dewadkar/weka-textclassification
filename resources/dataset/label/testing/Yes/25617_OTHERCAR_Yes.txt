            Call me shallow, but I've always hated the name of these cars.  As I understand it, Saturns are marketed as sensible vehicles, yet they have that planetary name.  Why?  To suggest that they're out of this world?  I don't get it.  Oh well, at least they didn't name them Pluto or Venus... or, God forbid, Uranus!

Although I don't own a Saturn, I've recently been scoping out small cars in order to make a new purchase.  I decided on a Ford Focus, but that's a story for another day.  In order to help facilitate my research, I borrowed a friend's <b>1998 Saturn SW2 wagon</b> for several days, and this epinion is a result of that experience.

The Saturn in question cost just under $19,000 when purchased new and has all sorts of goodies including power windows/mirrors/locks, a/c, automatic transmission, am/fm radio, cassette player, cruise control, tachometer, ABS, daytime running lights, traction control, rear window defroster, and dual airbags.  It's a well-equipped vehicle, and frankly it's a good-looking small wagon, as well.  This particular car is gently-driven, garaged, and currently has 37,000 miles on it.

I found that driving this car was a pleasure.  Although it is only 4-cylinder (and I am accustomed to driving a 6-cylinder), it had good pick-up.  My friend complains that the car struggles uphill on hot days when she has the a/c on, but I suspect that that is unavoidable in a 4-cylinder car.  In my experience, the car seemed sufficiently powerful for regular driving.  It accelerated nicely from a stop, for example.  My only complaint is that the engine is quite loud and surges frequently for no apparent reason.  I guess I could get used to the latter, but I found it disconcerting when I first began driving this vehicle.  Ironically, I never noticed the noise or surging when I rode in this vehicle as a passenger, so maybe it isn't that loud unless you're paying attention.

The car steers nicely.  It is generally a handling-pleasure, although the brakes weren't as responsive as I'd like.  The bucket seats were extremely uncomfortable for my back, so much so that I was developing a major backache until my friend pointed out to me a little lever on the driver's seat that makes the seat firmer.  I don't know what it's called.  She doesn't use this feature, but I found it a godsend in terms of driving comfort.

Ironically, the major drawback to this little station wagon is the wagon part itself.  If it were a sedan, I'd give it 4-5 stars for handling and performance.  But presumably someone buys a wagon for the wagon part of the car, and that is this car's absolute Achille's heel.

Two things about the wagon part defy my understanding.  One, when the split backseats are folded down, they do not lie flush with the rest of the wagon.  They are elevated, creating an awkward and senseless hump at the forward-end of the wagon.  What was the designer thinking?

Worse still, the back seat is divided into two seats.  One would think that the purpose of that would be to allow the car owner to fold down either seat or both seats, an added convenience.  Not in this car!  The rear seat behind the driver has a metal bar attached to it.  This means that this seat cannot be folded down unless the rear seat on the passenger side is folded down first (in which case the bar lies flat on top of that lowered seat).  If one folds the passenger-side rear seat down without folding the driver-side rear seat down, that bar just sticks out and sucks up space.  It is the most idiotic design I have ever seen in a station wagon!  My friend had a Saturn wagon prior to this 1998 model, and it did not have these two ridiculous &quot;improvements.&quot;  Whoever designed this model deserves to drive a Kia until they die.

The single feature that my friend likes best about this car is a silly elastic net that is in the far back of the wagon.  I can't imagine that I'd ever use it if it were my car, but she loves this thing to hold her groceries and other items.  

She also raves about Saturn's service department.  Although she hasn't had any meaningful problems with this car, service is polite and prompt... and as a bonus, they wash her car whenever she takes it in for even the most minor service.  That's a nice touch, I have to admit.  She does complain that they never have doughnuts when she goes, however.  

I still hate the name of the Saturn.  And I hate the idea of no-haggle (pay-more) pricing.  And I especially hate the gimmicky picnics and song-and-dance sales pitches.  I hate the ridiculous design of this '98 wagon.  All that being said, the car itself handles well and is a pleasure to drive.  It's comfortable, reliable, and doesn't burn a lot of gas.  Do I recommend it?  Sure thing.
