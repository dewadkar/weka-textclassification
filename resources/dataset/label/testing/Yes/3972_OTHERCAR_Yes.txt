            Last December I purchased a new 2000 Saturn LS. It was love at first sight.Blackberry in color with tan leather seats....the only thing it didn't include was the automatic remote engine starter! It includes ABS, power seats, rear spoiler, 6CD changer in trunk,and I like the fact that it offers both cassette and CD player.
I just can't say enough about the treatment I got from Saturn, Cheyenne! The sales was no haggle, the options were printed out like a menu, the salesman sat quietly in the back seat during the test drive...and boy did I test drive it! I probably scared him to death but I wanted a true test drive. It passed with flying colors! 
The service department resembles something out of a European Mercedes shop...clean and bright. My car is washed and detailed after each service appointment. There was a problem with the oil cooler cover seal but they fixed it immediately and gave me a loaner for the day
They have replaced all my Firestone tires with Michelins....no charge and included balancing and alignment. Great service!
The car has lots of room. The seat heaters are a god-send in Wyoming, and the traction control system has saved my bacon several times! Sound system is awesome,the transmission is smooooooooth shifting....second gear is where the zoom is and it gets there effortlessly!
I had the windows tinted by an outside company so the entire vehicle looks black until it gets in the sunlight where one can see the deep,deep purple. It turns heads! And fast, quick, responsive! I was surprised to read about it in Consumer Reports. They panned this model badly but nothing that they reported is evident in this model. Strange. I kept wondering how my personal experience and their testing could be so far apart! The only &quot;complaint&quot; I might have about this car is I don't get quite as good a gas mileage as my old Sable but then, I DRIVE this car....must be in my second childhood but I am enjoying this vehicle immensely!
