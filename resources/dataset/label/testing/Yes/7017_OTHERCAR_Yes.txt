            My Silhouette is a 1998, bought used in 1999.  It is very roomy, comfortable and has a huge amount of extras.  There is cruise control, power windows, locks, automatic sliding door on the right side, leather seats, outside temperature, mpg used and so on.  Needless to say, when you have so many extras, they do tend to need repairs more often than with a vehicle that doesn't have as much.

Before we even left the lot, we needed to have the rear seat replaced, because it couldn't be removed and put back properly.  I found that by accident.  I learned to check this kind of stuff now.  Also, the temperature gauge was incorrect.  It was off by about 50 degrees.  That was an obvious problem. We have also had the problem with the automatic door not closing when it should. But that's not too bad, it only happens once in awhile.  Now, I think my alternator is shot.  I'm not sure yet. I had to have it towed and there was no help as far as getting a rental until Monday.  So when you have a problem on the weekend, you have to wait.

Other than those few things, the vehicle is great.  I'm not sure if I'd buy another one.  I need more time, since I've only had it a year.<br><br>
