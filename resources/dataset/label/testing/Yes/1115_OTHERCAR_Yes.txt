            I just got my little Dodge neon, and I already love it.  I have only driven it 300 miles or so, but I am the kind of person who spends a lot of time on the road.   

I got my little RED dodge neon free from Tupperware, so when I got it it already had 6133 mile on it.  That is fine with me, it is still like a new car.  

THE LOOKS:
I just think that this little car looks cute.  I have often commented on them as I have seen them on the road, and there certainly seems to be a lot of them out there.  Tupperware picks the color, and all of their dodge neons are red. This particular one is the ES model.  It has cute headlights, that seem to reach a good distance, and I have rarely used the high beams.  It also comes equipped with fog lights.  

THE INTERIOR: 
My interior is gray in color, cloth seats.  I personally have not sat in the back, but I have had other consultants tell me that there is plenty of room.  My older daughter said that she had sufficient leg room.  I am not sure I would want to take a long trip in it with all three kids, but then again.  I would be crazy to do that anyway.  

There is a moderate size glove box in the dash in front of the passenger seat.  Then there is also a tape cassette holder between the front seats.  This is a bit awkward, make sure you have the tape you want to hear before you take off, because trying to dig for it after you start down the road, could cause an accident.  

There are three cup holders in the front of the car.  One has a space for the handled coffee cup, and is a convenient spot right in front of the tape box.  The other two are under the radio in the front, and a bit of a stretch to reach.  For me I have long legs, and I have to have my seat back a ways, so the cup holders are a reach.  For the rear seats, when you open the tape holder, the cover to that box acts a a cup holder for the rear passengers.  

The steering wheel is comfortable, and the lights, wipers, and horn are all easy to reach and use.  The tilt feature is not real elaborate, you have to pull a lever down, and then place your steering wheel where you want it, and then put the lever back in place.  The range of tilt is minimal.  

The power locks, and windows area bit strange.  The front has power windows, and the rear has manual windows.  I guess only the driver and front passenger needs the convenience of power windows.  The locks are another strange feature.  I am very self conscious about locking my keys in the car. First because I do it a lot, and second because when I was given my keys, I was told that it was the only set, and that it couldn't be duplicated, because of a computer chip in the key.  Just what I needed.  The other night I stopped quick to drop off some flyers, and left the car running, and when I returned to my car all of 1 minute later the doors were all locked, yes and obviously the key was in the car.  Thank God for triple AAA.  They got the car unlocked, about 1/2 hour later.  I have since discovered that when the door lock automatically was you pull away, even though you can open the door and get out, it does not automatically unlock the doors.  You must manually unlock the doors in order to be sure you will be able to get back into your car, or make sure you take the panic button part of your keys with you.  

THE SEATS:
The back seats lay down, so that you have more trunk space if needed, but I find that I can fit my folding table, and two kit bags easily in the trunk. I haven't tried regular luggage yet.  

The front seats feel comfortable, and I have not yet felt any strange back discomfort. The seat belts fasten a bit difficult, because of the tape cassette box between the seats, getting it fastened is hard, you have no room to fit your hand between the box, and the lock.  The shoulder strap is adjustable to make it as comfortable as possible. 

HEATING:
This is a big must for me, I live in the northeast, and it gets cold.  I hate driving cold.  Last night as a good test, this heater is awesome.  My feet were toasty warm, and my windows stayed clear.  I actually had to turn the heat down it got so hot. 

THE DRIVE:
The car seems to handle corners well, and drives with ease.  Last night was my first experience in the wind and snow.  I was a bit unsure of the car as I had never driven in bad weather with it, and it appeared to be easily blown, and I felt a bit insecure with it.  I just took it easy, to get a feel for how it would handle.  I think in the wind we were having any vehicle would have been whipped around a bit. In non windy weather it drives great.  I am not particularly hard on a vehicle, so I don't really know what type of punishment it will take, but I know for a fact that Tupperware manager put a lot of miles, wear and tear on a car, and Tupperware must have picked this vehicle to be able to withstand it. 

I really can't comment on gas mileage yet, because it ran for a 1/2 hour waiting for triple AAA, and I haven't had to re fill it yet.  I was told by another manager that her Tupperware neon gets about 35 miles per gallon.  Sounds good to me!!!
