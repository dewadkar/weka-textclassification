               The Impala is a great buy. Granted, the choice of moniker really sucks, and Chevy would of been much better off just calling it the next Lumina, but it really is a good value.
   The example I drove was a bright red be-spoilered LS model. Not bad looking. A little on the conservative side, but handsome. Actually, I got quite a few looks in it, including one on a highway of a guy who was already in a plum '00 Impala (not as nice as mine though!), who sped up to check mine out. The tan leather interior was nice, and pleasing to the touch. The seats were very nice and supportive, if not really sporty,  and all the materials felt high-quality. The 4-speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly, and reacted well to a hard stab of the gas, not getting confused but quickly downshifting and getting the power to me immediately until I let up. The brakes as well, worked superbly, stopping quickly and assuredly. It was quiet at highway speeds, a quiet conversation between one person up front and one in the back seat is possible. 
  I found the car quite spacious on the inside. All the glass creates an airy feeling in the car as well.
  The dash was a bit of a mixed bag for me. It was an inoffensive two-tone neutral tan color (I usually prefer a bolder persona in a car) which was ok, but I'd prefer a darker color such as grey or black, but not everyone would, so a good compromise to please everybody is understandable. It would be nice if they at least offered it though. It's ergonomically designed well, with nothing out of the ordinary going on with any of the switches, and pretty simple, which is great. But the negatives for me for this dash are 1.) To me it doesn't match the exterior of the car. I was expecting a sportier, more contemporary looking dash. And 2.) This dash looks too OLD for the car. It strikes me as something that might of been put into an older model Cadillac or Lincoln. It works well, just looks a bit out of place to me..
  Onto more pleasing and positive things about this car......
  I love this engine. I love it even more in it's Supercharged form, but it provides more than enough grunt in it's naturally-aspirated form. The engine was stout, responsive, and smooth. When you need power, you got it. Some people may complain that it's &quot;dated&quot;, but I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The 3.8-liter V6 more than holds its own with the biggest V6s Honda and Toyota offer with 200 horses (@5200rpm) and 225 ft-lbs of torque (@ 4000rpm)} An advantage to pushrod design besides, is that is has more low-rpm torque than a DOHC, SOHC, or VTEC which needs to be revved higher to get all the power. 
  It also gets pretty commendable gas mileage with the 3.8 getting around 20mpg in the city and 29mpg on the highway. The 3.3-liter engine should get around 20mpg also in town, and 32mpg on the highway. I highly recommend the upgrade to the 3.8-liter V6.
  A great value, and a superb alternative to any of the Asian imports for those looking for an American buy.<br><br>
