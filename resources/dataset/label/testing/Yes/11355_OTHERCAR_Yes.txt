            Yes, I admit I am part of the small minority of dads who drive minivans. Sure, its not the most glamorous car, and certainly doesn't compare to the '99 Trans Am I had in mind, but if you ever tried to fit a carseat in the back of a two door car, you'll love the Caravan.  It comes standard with dual sliding doors, an option which you cannot fully appreciate until you have the luxury of having them.  The Caravan Sport (which I purchased) has a enhanced sound system which really sounds great (can blow the ear drums out on the kiddies if you are so cruel). It also sports (pardon the pun) upgraded wheels, a slightly larger engine, and of course the essential spoiler (I know, I know, but it does look as cool as a minivan can!)  The van is extremely comfortable even for my 6' 1&quot; frame, and drives more like a car than a van (except the Trans Am would have produced better gas mileage, or so I tell my wife).  I have not had any service problems up to the 10,000 miles I've put on, with the exception of a blown speaker (kids weren't in the car, I promise) in the back which is fully covered by the 3 yr 36K mile warranty.  All-in-all a really dependable car with as much style as you cab expect in a minivan<br><br>
