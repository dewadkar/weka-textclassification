            My Jetta has definitely served two purposes in my teenage years.  One, attracting many ladies to my fine ride. Secondly getting me where I want to go in style.  Although the car does lack in engine power, as it is only a 4 cylinder, it still got me where I needed to go for the past few years.  I would definitely recommend this car to any teenager or young twenties guy/girl looking for an affordable roomy ride. 

This car has been great for weekend road trips all over the East Coast and at 35,000 miles is still going strong with only minor problems needing fixing.  The sound system that came with the car wasn't too bad but would be very inadequate for anyone as much of a music enthusiast as I am.  Personally I replaced the system for a JVC CD Player, which has integrated great into the car. 

The car definitely has room to fit five people very comfortably, as I found out many times and no one ever feels cramped.  One minor con of note is the comfort level of the seats. The cushioning could be a little more comfortable over long trips but is dealable.  Overall I would recommend this car over other cars in its class such as a Honda Accord.
