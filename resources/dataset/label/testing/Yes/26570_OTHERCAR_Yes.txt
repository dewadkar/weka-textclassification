            I like my Nissan. Plain and simple. It's a good car that handles well on the road. It's roomy enough to fit my family of four, yet it's small enough so that it's not a pain with parking (I live the DC metro area where parking is almost a life or death issue.) 

The engine runs well. It has great acceleration. I've put five years and 60,000 miles on the car and the only major engine repair I've had to make so far was replacing the starter. This car has even been dented a couple of times in accidents, yet it kept going strong. The brakes work well, and I can drive it at 85 miles per hour and feel like I'm doing 50.

The only down side is that if you are a young male, like I am, your insurance is going to hurt a little. This is going to be true of nearly any young guy who's driving a car that is halfway decent. But if you are tired of driving around in your bucket-mobile and need a step up, be a player and step up to a Nissan. 

I'd recommend the Nissan 300SX for the driver who needs to settle down a little yet still wants to maintain some sense of style. <br><br>
