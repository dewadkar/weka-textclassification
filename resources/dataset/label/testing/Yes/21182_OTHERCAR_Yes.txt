                 I bought this vehicle because I needed a car that would be cheap to operate.  It was a program car with only 25,000 miles when I bought it.  I love the gas mileage I get on this car.  I get between 32 and 40 miles to the gallon, depending on if I am driving highway miles or around town.  This car is small enough to be easy to park and large enough to have a pretty good, smooth ride.  The only complaint that I have with this car is that the door handles break pretty easy.  I now have 128,000 miles on my car and have only had to replace the front break linings once and the alternator once.  I think that is pretty darn good for any car!   If you want a good dependable car, this is the car for you.<br><br>
