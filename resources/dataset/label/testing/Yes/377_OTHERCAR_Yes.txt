            My husband had been debating on getting a new car for a while.  Along came the Nissan Xterra and he (we) were hooked.  The car was reviewed as a poor man's Land Rover.  I personally was not a big SUV fan until I drove it.  I have never felt so safe, sometimes finding myself forgetting to put on my seatbelt which I NEVER did in my sedan size car.   The ride is very smooth. There is NEVER the feeling that you are going to tip over (and I have tried). <br>The best experience was when we got the first snow fall.  It wasn't much but enough for me to push the truck to the limit with and WITHOUT the 4-WD.  As soon as the car started to slide I put it into 4-WD and was just driving and smiling.  Everyone else was going about 10 miles per hour and I was doing 20 and wanting to go faster.  One of the features which I like, is while you are driving (and the road is a bit slick) your brake pedal will start to jump indicating for you to go into 4-WD.<br><br>The back seats are elevated which means the kids can actually see out of the front window instead of looking at the back of a chair.  Two things that struck me as odd were there is no lock on the glove compartment or gas tank.  You have to manually open the gas tank, there is no switch inside to push.  Maybe I'm just lazy but my 1st car is a Nissan and I have both of these features. I would think it would be a standard feature since this is a 2000 and cost much, much more money.<br><br><br>
