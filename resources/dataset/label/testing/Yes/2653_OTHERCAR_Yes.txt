            I researched SUV's for over a year before making this purchase. I bought our new Baby in late July 2003' just as the 2003's came off the truck at our local dealer. They couldn't keep them in stock as they were flying out of the lot. I was not sold after the 1st test drive, but was impressed enough to keep it in the running of the top 3 choices. It came down to the Jeep Liberty, Ford Escape and crazy enough the CRV's Big Brother the Pilot. Yes, we were leaning towads the Pilot- Making the big splurge$ and taking the upgrade. Well, why did I chose the CRV? I can say the biggest factor in play was $Value! I mean the Liberty had kick butt power, it's way cute and I am a tom boy, rugged, outdoors gal who ski's! Ford Escape was way too plain inside with uncomfortable seats & covering and less cargo room. Besides, the V6 on those guys were way more Gas$- especially in mountain driving. 
Well, that left the gorgeous Big Boy, "Pilot".. Also flying off the lots as we were seeing it for the 1st time. 
Well, I am an avid (Sunroof lover) too. I MUST have the electric sunroof! Guess what Honda forgot to put in the Pilot? Yep, A freakin absolute notta in the sunroof department. Can you believe it?
Well, my dear Hubby could NOT believe his ears when I said... I don't want the Pilot- cuz it dosen't have a sunroof- Researched it out and you couldnt add one because the way it was designed in the roof there would be interference with the steel reinforcement beams running accross the top. So, long story short.. We bought the CRV. I was a bit let down with the style of the rear end, tail lights- kinda freaky running the entire rear sides- But I have got used to it now after a year- I also had complaints about the useless fold down arm rests at first
until I realized they were great for holding my mini-vcr/tv that we put in the middle island for my 5 year-old on road trips. 
Overall, I am pleased with all aspects of this vehicle, I was suprised with the torque of the 165hp and "smooth as a baby's behind" automatic transmission. 

I have hauled over 25 bags of mulch home from lowes at one time with the back seats down and up against the front seat. 

We have done numerous ski road trips-I purchased the Thule ski rack attachment/raised 4 legs and had it installed by the local bike shop with no problems. I pop it out for summer time since I like my sun roof open and the whistle noise from the rack bugs me..

We hauled a full sized washer & Dryer (seperately). 

I have hauled 5ft long book shelf in a box, with the end of the box protruding through the back pop up window- only because my son wanted to continue watching his movie on our way home from an IKEA shopping spree. It would have fit w/ the window shut- but then the front passenger seat had to be pushed up and then the TV would not stay secure in the middle island. 

We live near the beach and constantly drive here and there-we have not had ANY mechanical issues- just had it's 1st yearly state inspection (Passed of course).
I have to say, I am very attached to my CRV (I bought the BLACK one- It's the best! color) I miss it if the Hubby has to take it for the day for hauling etc. I can't wait till I get it back. 

I know I haven't given you all the essential mechanical details- But rather a more emotional side of the purchase. I hope this lil different viewpoint has helped as you ponder your decision.

I am watching the 2004 Pilot to see if they got it right this year and put the Sunroof in it?  If so, well, we will prolly be upsizing in 2005' to it. 
I LUV the CRV, But would like the extra room & built in DVD system..
