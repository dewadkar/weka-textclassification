            I bought my 1993 Mercedes 300SD new in August, 1993. This purchase was a   huge decision because I am not a wealthy individual.  I must admit    this purchase was more of an impulse purchase as opposed to a very planned and deliberate purchase.  I purchased this vehicle more as an     investment rather than an expenditure. I fully intend to keep this vehicle for 10 or 20 years.  Mercedes vehicles just seem to age very gracefully.                                                                I purchased a diesel vehicle believing it would be more reliable and would last many more years as opposed to a gasoline engine. So far so good.  I must admit that I pampered this vehicle for the initial three or four years. I did not drive the vehicle in the snow. This sedan only has 37,000 miles. At this rate, I may never learn whether the diesal engine is as durable as I wished.                                                I am impressed with the diesal engine. It is not as loud as I expected.  I also cannot believe how clean it operates. I never realize I am driving a diesal vehicle until the cold weather arrives.  The car does take a few minutes to get rolling when the temperature drops below 25 degrees Fahrenheit.  Otherwise it performs admirably. The car is turbo charged.  This gives it more power and acceleration than your average gasoline luxury car.                                                               I also am extremely impressed with the mileage this car delivers.  I am getting approximately 30 mpg. Very good mileage when you consider this car is as heavy and solid as a tank.                                      The car is expensive but the quality is apparent from the paint job to a premium Bose sound system to the supreme feeling of safety you receive as you are driving down the highway.                                       The monthly car payments were a royal pain in the neck. However, now that the payments have ended, I seem to like the car all the more.<br><br>
