            I am the proud owner of a 97 Grand Cherokee Laredo. I bought it when it only had 24,000 miles on it. I've had it four a year and a half now and i wouldn't trade it for another make or model in the world! I love Jeep. I went through the winter in four wheel drive great! There were people that had slid off into ditches and i was still hugging the road. I've told others about how dependable jeeps are, and a friend of mine went out and bought one.
If you keep regular maintenance like tune-up,oil change, check your belts, brakes, it should last you a long time time. I should know, I already have 130,000 miles on mine! A friend had said it still drives like new. The old saying that &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; rings true. You may pay more for a jeep, but, you'll get a good, dependable, quality vehicle.<br><br>
