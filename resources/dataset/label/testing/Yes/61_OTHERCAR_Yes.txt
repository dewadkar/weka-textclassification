            I recently had the opportunity to test drive this fine vehicle the other day and I can truly say that it has it all.  I have been saving my money to buy a car like this for years and I hope that in the coming months this dream will become a reality.  This Mercedes really does have all kinds of great features and is one of the best cars that I have ever driven.

The first thing that jumped out at me when I decided to give this car a drive was its appearance.  It is a truly luxurious vehicle and is one of the most appealing that I have ever seen.  Leather interior is mandatory and the body of the vehicle is certainly an eye catcher.

The car also performs like a champ.  It seems as though the passengers are riding on air and the cornering and handling is also superb.  I personally drove the car in wet, rainy conditions and found that it handled much better than most other cars would have in good conditions.  Needless to say I was truly impressed.

Furthermore, this car can be obtained with many fancy features.  It has many optional features that are truly unique such as rear air bags and map control for long trips and distance driving.

Needless to say, this car is very expensive as many cars from this fine automaker are.  But, if you haver the money and would like to drive a truly great vehicle you might want to give this car a try and see if it is for you. <br><br>
