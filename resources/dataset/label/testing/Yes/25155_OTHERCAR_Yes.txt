            This new camera has changed my life!  It is so portable that I can drop it in my front pants pocket wherever I go, without it getting in the way.  In addition, it has the best color I have seen yet on a digital camera, crisp 2.1 Mpixel imaging, and the slickest and easiest-to-use UI I've seen yet.  The screen has very little refresh lag, great color, and is visible even in daylight.  It has a broad feature set including 30-second movie capture (with sound), automatic stitching (to create panoramas), and manual mode to control exposure etc.  It comes with a lithium ion battery which I have found sufficient for about 1 1/2 days of aggressive shooting.  The only problem I have seen is that, because of its small aperture, nighttime scenery pix (non-flash) come out a bit blurry if the camera is not perfectly still.  Overall, a great buy and a great camera!
