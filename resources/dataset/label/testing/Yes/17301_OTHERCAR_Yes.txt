            In the '60's Chevy came out with a family sedan called the Malibu. Equipped with the 350 or 327 engine they offered good styling, great acceleration, and lots of room. 
Oh what a difference 30 years makes.
I recently had the pleasure of driving a 2001 Malibu for two months and came away impressed. Favorably impressed. If I were in the market for a family sedan I would probably buy this car. For the price,it is hard to beat. 
The first impression of the Malibu is of an inoffensive daily driver. The styling won't knock anyone out but it is a handsome car in its own right. Slipping into the driver's seat you notice that all the controls are readily accessible. In fact, once in the driving position you hardly have to move your arms at all to access all the controls. The small shelf under the radio is a nice touch. 
The engine moves the car with alacrity and the steering is responsive. Passing is more a question of when not if. I drove this car for 4-5 hours at a clip and always got out feeling as if I had just stepped into the vehicle. 
The car gives the impression that all the weight is below the axles. This makes for a very stable platform and inspires confidence in enthusiastic driving. 
My only peeve with the car stems from the drivetrain and the factory tires. I am not a fan of front-wheel drive cars and the Malibu does much to overcome this shortcoming but on any kind of slick surface at all the car gets squirrely and the tires protest mightily. My first action as an owner would be to replace the factory tires with something better.
Overall, this is a good car at a great price.
