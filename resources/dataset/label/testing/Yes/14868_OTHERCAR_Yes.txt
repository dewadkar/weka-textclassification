            When Sony came out with this camera a few years ago I wanted one so bad that I could taste it. Oh the ease of taking pictures and having them on a floppy disk! I drooled over the magazine ads, visited the stores to handle one and drooled some more! Each month when I got my computer magazines there was always an ad or article about the Sony Mavica and I would show my husband &quot;This is the camera I want!&quot; Finally for Valentine's day last year he bought me one. I have been in heaven ever since. The ease of using this camera is one of it's best features. You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a computer whiz to take pictures, take the disk to your computer and have those pictures of the grandkids flying all over cyberspace. 

The floppy disk was what really sold me on the Sony Mavica camera. I have no qualms whatsoever of taking pictures on a disk and handing it to someone but if it was one of those memory cards that cost a fortune I wouldn't even THINK about giving them out to my family much less a stranger! When Mother's Day came my daughter gave me a box of 50 floppy disks. At the time I couldn't fathom using up that many disks but I did! 

My only disappointment with the camera was the battery that came with it. It doesn't have enough stamina for long picture taking sessions. I have purchased another battery with a longer life that has plenty of stamina for those days with the grandkids that scream for just one more shot of that sweet face or cute smile or &quot;Watch this Nanny!&quot; picture that I wouldn't trade for all the tea in China.
