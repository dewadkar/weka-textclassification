            This was my second Honda that I have owned.  My first was a 95 Honda Del Sol, which I traded in because I got married and needed more room. I purchased my 99 Honda Civic LX Jan. 1999.  I have never regretted it or been dissatisfied.  True, I do miss my little Del Sol, but the Honda Civic has so much more room.  I have 2 Springer Spaniels that love to go for rides, so I need the room.  I do wish I had purchased a 6-cylinder, instead of my 4 speed.  But my 4 speed does have quick go power.  I did have to have Honda install a CD player after I purchased it.  My Honda is paid off, so I plan to keep it around for a long time.  It's a smooth ride, and can handle speeds of 80-85 on the interstate.  I am glad I made the trade before Honda started changing its body style, because I really don't like the new Honda Civics.  

I always have wanted a scan button on the radio in both the Hondas I have owned.  Scan Button-so I don't have to keep hitting the tune button for a radio station.  I like the feature of the reminder of my lights on.  I really have no complaints of my Honda.  I love it!   I have had no problems with my car!
