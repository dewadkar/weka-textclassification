            Wow this car is fancy.  So large, roomy, luxurious, and great for the big family trip.  This car has it all, with 8 seats, four wheel drive, all-terrain mode, and extreme ease of movement, you and your family can go just about anywhere painlessly.  I have yet to find something wrong with this car.

The Chevrolet Suburban is truthfully underestimated in that no one seems to want it that badly and no one gives it a chance.  Try it out for lease! Research more and buy it! Whatever you want, just make sure this great car gets around a bit more. 

With 12 drink holders, memory for seat position up front, and great full-car operable AC, what more can you ask in a car?  The only disappointment is that this is not your car if gargantuan does not describe the vehicle you are looking for.<br><br>
