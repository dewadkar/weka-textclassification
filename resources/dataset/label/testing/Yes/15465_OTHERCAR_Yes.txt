            The Sony MVC-FD88 is an excellent camera all together. It come with a great zoom, 16x optical, so it will let you zoom in on all those distant pictures. Great resolution! Compared to the Sony 83 and 73, this digital camera will provide you with everything you need to, to take a great picture. Instead of using a smart media or flash card, you use a 3.5 floppy disk, which is a lot easier to load onto your computer. It will also let you record a short movie with sound using the mpeg. Clearly one of the best camera's out there

The only problem with this camera is that by using a floppy, your not going to be able to hold that many pictures on it, when your using high resolution. Your going to be finding yourself changing the floppy very quickly.
