            Before I get too into this review let me say something: I don't own this car nor will I ever possess one unless I intend to live in it.  Instead I got to drive this car through a horribly shameless method I like to refer to as &quot;begging.&quot;  It's quite simple, really.  One of my friends happens to be filthy rich (I am not, for the record) and lives in the ultra-exclusive Isleworth neighborhood of Orlando.  On one side his neighbor is Mark O'Meara.  On the other side is a guy with a new Bentley Arnage Red Label.  You can guess which  neighbor I introduced myself to first.

Red Label me.

To be truthful folks I did not drive the car that entirely long.  I wheeled her down the driveway (although to my credit it was a fairly long driveway) at which point Red Label guy (what I refer to this neighbor as) promptly took control and drove for the rest of our excursion (and I must say he did not go lightly on it)--save for another short stint I had in an empty parking lot.

This could be the best car in the world.  It seats 4 adults in luxurious comfort, and 5 if they like each other.  Wood, leather, and chrome tend to overwhelm the senses.  A huge expanse of wood covers the dash and the doors make a reassuring &quot;thunk&quot; when you close them.  The meticulous attention to detail is a result of thousands of man-hours spent lovingly crafting this automobile.  The interior looks as though it were lifted straight from an English castle's parlor or hunting lodge.  I think a deer's head or hunting rifle should be mounted somewhere in the interior to achieve the full effect.  

Outside the Arnage is no different.  The magnificent prow and imposing mesh grille are surely to be noticed in anyone's rear view mirror.  The large front air dam and chromed 18-inch rims mounted on huge rubber lend an aggressive air to the look.  But its graceful lines belie the intimidating stance that shows that this car means business.

And what a business it means.  A car of this size has in all honesty has no right to accelerate this quickly or handle this well.  This 5000+ pound automobile shamelessly outclasses other cars much smaller--either on the dragstrip or on backcountry B-roads.  With 400 horsepower and 620 lb-ft of torque this car can easily outgun 99% of the cars on the road today.  Try 0-60 in 5.9 seconds.  But let's not be ridiculous here.  It is a big car and as such when it comes right down to it there's just no way the Arnage will be a true weekend toy.  A Bentley's not made to burn the B-roads--that's what the 911 next to the Arnage in the garage is for.  If you can afford Arnage you can well afford another 10 cars, each suited to its own particular specialty.

However don't take that as a complaint.  In fact there are no complaints to speak of, really.  The ride might be a touch harsh, but then you must compromise if you want it to handle and communicate as well as it does for such a gargantuan auto.  Get a Rolls if you want soft ride.  And the gas mileage is obscene.  So what?  If you can afford a quarter of a million dollar car I should hope you can afford gas for a car you most likely won't be driving to work every day.

In any case my advice to the unwashed masses out there (like me) who can't afford the Arnage Red Label to do this: Sell the house, the kids, any unnecessary organs, and whatever else whatever it takes to raise nearly $300,000 (that number includes gas money, insurance, servicing, etc.) and BUY THIS CAR!!!  It is that good.<br><br>
