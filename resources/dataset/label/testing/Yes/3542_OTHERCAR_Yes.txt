            I almost didn't buy this camera because of bad reviews that I have read. I saw several good reviews on other review sites and figured I would give it a shot. Nobody at the place I shop knew anything about the camera. I didn't want to spend over $300 on a camera and no other camera this price was over 1.3 megapixels. Sure you can get a few more features out of some of the other cameras in this price range with less resolution and because of it's price you can't compare it to other 2.1 megapixel cameras until the other camera manufacturers bring out models to compete with this cameras at this price. Pictures I took were pretty close to other 2.1 megapixel cameras I've seen and a lot sharper than other cameras in the $300 price range. Only real bad weakness is the lack of ISO settings that you really need in some situations. 

This would be a good Camera for the Beginner and Intermediate user.<br><br>
