            I love this car.  I purchased a new 97 Pathfinder and do not regret it.  I had wanted one for many years and finally took the plunge and bought it.

What I love about it: 
The price.  It is a great value for the money.  I couldn't find another SUV in the same category in the same price range.
The ride.  This is a personal choice.  The Pathfinder is built on a car chasis (i believe) and therefore drives more like a car than a truck.  It makes for a smoother ride.
Reliability. After 2+ years, I have yet to have a problem with this car.  Occassional service has taken it this far and should take it further.

What I don't like:
The only think I didn't like was the experience with the dealer, big surprise.  Too many lies during the sales process, although service through the dealer has been satisfactory.
