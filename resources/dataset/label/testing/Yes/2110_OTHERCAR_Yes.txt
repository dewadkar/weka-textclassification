            My sister owns a black '94 XJS convertible coupe and I had the pleasure of driving it last summer on a 1600 mile round trip.  

The styling of this car is only part of what makes Jaguar famous.  It's a smaller model than the more popular XJ12's which I see everywhere, which gives it it's own distinction.  This car elicits more comments from strangers than any other car I've driven which is fun as I love talking to people I've just met.  I have to admit that sometimes I'm a little embarrassed to be driving in something so showy around where I live, especially with the top down and in traffic, but on a trip it was pretty easy to accept and I guess that's part of the fun of this car anyway.

Besides the appearance, the other part of what makes Jaguar so famous is what is under the hood.  The car I drove was an automatic with a 'superdrive' switch which gives it some kind of boost at higher speeds.  The ride is extremely smooth at high speeds as it's very hard to tell how fast your going from the sound or the feel.  The only giveaway is the scenery sliding by so fast on either side.  I would love to have driven a manual transmission, but wouldn't kick the automatic out of bed.  I found it to have great torque and the 0-60 time of course blows my measly Celica (see my review) out of the water...  and this is the 6 Cylinder automatic!  I almost cant imagine what a manual XJS 12 Cylinder would be like.  

It of course comes loaded with all the luxury novelties such as fully power seats with heaters, heated mirrors, full power roof, superb sound system (added a 10 CD Changer), factory alarm/remote power lock system, cruise control, climate control etc.

Buying this car second hand was a great way to get into a very sporty and luxurious car which was well taken care of and will last for many years to come if taken care of.  

I'm not sure how this car handles overall in the winter as I haven't really driven it extensively in winter.  I have driven it occasionally in snow, but needless to say wasn't doing any donuts in it.  I suppose a car of this caliper demands some respect, but the power is there if you need it.  

I would definitely recommend picking one of these up as an introduction to the Jaguar line of luxury cars.  The current 2000 XJS is an incredible looking car and it performance specs are even more attractive.  At a pricetag of around 80,000 I'm still waiting, but someday...
