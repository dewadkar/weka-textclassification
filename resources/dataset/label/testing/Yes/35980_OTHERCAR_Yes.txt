              This car's build quality, and the exterior and interior materials are well above average. It is evident that Good quality control standards are implemented at the assembly plant. 

  The engine is reliable never burns oil. although, it does lack power, especially when yielding into highway speeds. And The car's deficit of power is obvious when driving up steep grades.

  The fuel economy on my vehicle is not too competitive with my 97 Nissan. The average mileage I have noted is between 26 and 29 MPG as apposed to my Nissan's 40 MPG. The fuel economy for city driving is about 22 MPG.

  The first thing I noticed when I first bought this car is the lack of cooling in the passenger compartment. It took at least 30 to 45 minutes for the the interior to cool mildly. Just recently however, the AC compressor burned up  at 54,000 miles. The cost to replace the compressor, clutch, expansion valve, etc, totals $1,315.00.  I called the Honda factory, and they told me that they will assist me on repairing the problem but I would only have to pay $850.00 plus tax. I guess it's better than no help.

  Otherwise, I have been quite pleased with the aspects of this car but I would prefer a car that's a bit more roomy with a bit more power.  Huh, how about an Accord maybe?
