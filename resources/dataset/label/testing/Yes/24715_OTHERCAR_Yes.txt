            It took me about 6 months to find the right digital camera for me.  Back in October of 1999 I bought a Fuji 2900 and absolutely loved it!  Well about 3 weeks ago my Fuji camera broke.  It would no longer read the smart media card, therefore it couldn't take or show pictures.  I took the camera back to the store and since they no longer carried the camera they told me I could get a new one.  I was so upset.  I loved my Fuji and didn't want a new camera.  I started to look at the newer models and the Sony DSC-S70 instantly caught my eye.

List below are the features that caught my eye :

*The USB interface.  This allows your camera to become a removable drive.  What this means is that you can access your camera like any other drive on your computer, avoiding the long download times of most other devices.

*3.3 Megapixels and 2048x1536 Image Size.  This is very important feature to me because I use my digital camera as my sole camera.  I have my pictures printed on a photo printer. You may change the size of the picture after it is taken or before it is taken to the following sizes 2048x1535, 1600x1200, 1280x960, and 640x480.

*Ability to purchase and add external lens and filters.

*Memory stick storage device.  

*Ability to take 15 second MPEG movies.

The one thing that I have been a little disappointed in is the time it takes to shoot a picture.  This is a bit slower then my Fuji.  I have missed a few priceless smiles.  I have noticed that the timing is much faster though if you turn off the LCD screen.  Since I started shooting the pictures with the LCD screen turned off I have been very satisfied with the timing.

I looked at all of the camera's that had 3.3 mega pixels and higher, the Sony DSC-S70 was by far the most user friendly and durable camera.  I was able to figure out how to operate the camera without any help from the manual.  There are many advanced features on the camera where the manual comes in handy, but these features are more along the lines of advanced photography.

I highly recommend this camera for beginners through more advanced digital photographers.  I have had this camera for just over 2 weeks and am very happy I made the switch.  The picture quality is unbelievable!<br><br>
