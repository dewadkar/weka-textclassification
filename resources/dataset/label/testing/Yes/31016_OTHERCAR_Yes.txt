            I have 4500 miles on my 2002 Ram 4DR SLT.  The 4.7L engine has very good power although I have not pulled any big loads.  The gas mileage was terrible at first (13.5 city, 16 hwy), but I have seen improvement.  Lately I've been getting 15.5 city and 18.5 hwy.

My friend has a '97 Dakota ext cab w/5.2L auto.  At 40 mph, he tried to pass me and could not.  He gave up at 85 mph.  He is impressed with my truck.

The only complaint I have is rattles.  There are numerous rattles in the dash and the drivers door.  The rattles are not consistent or predictable.  It has been to the dealer several times.  They have heard them but have not been able to find or fix them.

I know one of the rattles is coming from the connector to the power window switch.  It is caused by the wire terminals rattling in the connector socket.  I believe another rattle is coming from the door handle on the outside.

The power seat has about 1/4" of play in it.  After I come to a stop and then accelerate, I can feel it move.  I have not had the dealer look at this yet - maybe after I get the rattles taken care of.

The ride is pretty stiff.  The plastic bags you get from Home Depot or Wal-Mart vibrate excessively and make a fluttering/crackly sounds (especially when they are in the front seat) that can be annoying for long drives.

Overall, the truck is pretty good.  If I could get rid of the rattles it would be excellent.
