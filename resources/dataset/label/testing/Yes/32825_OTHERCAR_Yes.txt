            I swore to myself that I would never buy a new car.  The thought that a car depreciates 10% or more coming off the lot makes me cringe.  But after languishing around in unreliable used cars and spending two years mostly on the bus because my car was always in the shop, I finally broke down and bought the new 1995 Cavalier.
I did some research for a couple of months and narrowed it down to the Cavalier and the Dodge Neon.  My dad (full disclosure: My father worked for GM in Michigan for 9 years in the 50's) convinced me that the Cavalier was for me.  Plus, if I had to drive a small car around, I at least wanted one that said &quot;What's up?&quot; instead of just &quot;Hi.&quot;
So off I went to the dealer to buy my first brand-spanking new car.  I decided that since I was buying the Cavalier because of its affordability, I wasn't about to negate that by loading it up with a bunch of features.  I made some good decisions and I made some not so-good ones.
I bought the car with absolutely no features except the window-defroster (an item you absolutely must have during Chicago winter) and the floor mats (which I had to negotiate for hours just to get the dealer to throw those in for free).  That's it.

No radio - good decision - I would only replace the factory with a name brand one later anyway.

No air-conditioning - very bad decision - I figured Chicago summers last two weeks, but driving in a small Cavalier with no air during those two weeks was unbearable. At the time, it was a $400 option, after market it would cost close to $1100 to install.  I didn't.

No automatic transmission - I ended up being happy about this decision - although stick-shift is not ideal for stop-and-go traffic, the 5-speed manual delivers a lot more pep from the 4-cyl engine than the 3-speed automatic.

No power anything - neutral decision - Cavalier is small enough where this doesn't make a big difference.  Power locks, windows, etc.  is really a matter of whether those little gadgets are important to you or not.  They're really not to me.  Although, they help out quite a bit in resale value.

Overall, the Cavalier was very reliable, great on gas mileage, and handled very well.  It loses some of its integrity fairly quickly and many other members of epinion have already commented on hearing little shakes and rattles over time.  This is true of any car, but the Cavalier reaches that stage a bit prematurely.

But for a fun first-time car with nice styling and affordability, it is hard to top the Cavalier.  A young professional looking for reliable transportation and possibly looking to build their credit would do well with this car.  It continues to be more pleasing to the eye that other cars in its class, because it tries to look bigger.  The Escort, Neon, Civic, etc. definitely look smaller, although they really aren't.  The new redesigned Dodge Neon gives Cavalier styling some strong competition.  I believe the Chevrolet Cavalier is due for a strong re-design.  Nevertheless, Cavalier is a good buy.
