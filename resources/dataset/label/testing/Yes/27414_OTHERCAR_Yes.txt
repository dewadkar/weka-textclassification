            My fiance decided to buy this car because it was in great shape and had great power and control. He bought this car used for $6,999 and it was a good deal. The only thing was that it had about a golf ball size piece of paint missing from the top of the rear passenger side door. No big problem.

He loves the car because it handles the road great and has great power. He also loves the car because of the radio and the bass that it produces. This car is very comfortable and has plenty of room in front and back. Has camero doors. He also likes that it has bigger tires on the back and smaller ones on front. Now we get to the bad side. The brakes, they squeak but it is not a loud squeak, the gas mileage is bad he can go only 200 miles from the full mark to 1/4 of tank. When he first got this car it shifted hard from 1st to 2nd but now it don't. Another thing is this neon that he has sits very low.

He says that it is a great car to have and drive. All cars have their problems and no car is perfect.

People who love low sitting cars and cars that have bass and a great radio. Also, if you want a car with bass you should buy this car. People who get mad at their car just because of minor problems should not buy this car.<br><br>
