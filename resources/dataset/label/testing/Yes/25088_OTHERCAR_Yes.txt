            This review covers time spent (2000 miles) in a rental car. The vehicle was a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer rented from National Car rental. If you would like information on National Car Rental, please see my other reviews.

I picked this vehicle up in Atlanta and the following are my impressions of the 2002 Chevy Trailblazer.

This review may not cover some peoples planned usage of an SUV, we did not go off road, and we didn�t go to the beach, but we did spend some serious driving time in this vehicle, through snow and ice and valet parking�  We never found anything to complain about in our time with the Trailblazer. 

In 2000 miles of mostly highway driving with my family of three, our experience was that this vehicle is more refined than the older style Blazer that it will replace in Chevrolet's lineup. The still available Blazer is a smaller well-worn design that needed improvement. The Trailblazer is not an update of the blazer however; it is an entirely new vehicle. I suppose an appropriate analogy of the difference between the Blazer and the Trailblazer would be to compare a Cadillac with a Chevette, you can get around in the Chevette, but you want to drive the Cadillac! 

The Trailblazer�s smooth character on the highway was matched by its much-refined suspension in city driving. Neither Atlanta, nor Chicago is known for their smooth roads, but the Trailblazer handled both with the aplomb of a fine sedan. This is a very well built mid-size SUV! The six-cylinder engine has more than enough horsepower (270 hp) to get up the on ramp and get out of the way of any marauding 18-wheeler! 

When driving in icy conditions or off road, a simple dash mounted switch allows the driver to choose a 4x4 setting that matches the expected conditions (long gone are the days when you had to get out and engage the front hubs). I used the 2-wheel drive option for most of our driving. But when the snow was flying and the ice was on the ponds in Indiana and Illinois, I selected 4-wheel high for the safety and peace of mind. You could feel a slight difference in the vehicle with 4-wheel high engaged, but nothing like the gear grinding hum that I normally associate with a 4x4. It was smooth, yet you could feel the extra traction. Additionally, I would like to give the brakes honorable mention here. Chevrolet has had less than capable braking in its SUV�s in the past, this problem appears to be solved. I never have felt more comfortable with the braking capabilities in any other vehicle than I was in this Trailblazer. The 4 wheel disc system installed in this vehicle is very capable!

The interior is comfortable and every control for the driver was accessible and well organized. The interior fit and finish seemed quite nice, even though this was a base model rental, it had many features that one would not expect from a base model. Heated side mirrors, a fantastic 6 speaker CD stereo, cruise control, dual zone A/C & Heat (A very nice feature indeed) rear window defrost and wiper, rear A/C vents, luggage rack, bucket seats w/ lumbar supports, automatic headlights & dimmers, etc�etc� 

The rear hatch was a glass/gate type, which allowed access to the cargo area without opening the whole gate. And I appreciated not having a tailgate to lean over. My wife pronounced the rear seat to be comfortable and roomy so she and our daughter camped out in the back during our long days of driving. Overall we were a much happier and well rested family at the end of the driving day, having spent it in the Trailblazer over what we would have been in the Blazer. 

Cargo room is to be commended as well; we had packed for a 9-day trip on the road with a baby. This included baby�s carriage, play yard, and numerous other accessories and accoutrements in addition to her parents collection of suitcases, make-up cases, computer bags, pillows, and so on. The Trailblazer handled the whole expeditions worth of luggage and even allowed the driver room to see out the rear view mirror.

To complete this article, I will tell you that upon our return home, and after unloading all of our cargo, I returned the car to its owner, National Car Rental. This was the only driving I did with the vehicle unloaded. Man, the car was fast on that last leg of my trip, not just straight line fast, but corner hugging, tight turning, quick parking fast! The Trailblazer is quick and nimble in traffic and smooth on the highway, a very satisfactory combination if you ask me!

I really felt a pang of remorse that our time together was coming to a close, undoubtedly this Trailblazer would go on to impress probably hundreds of other drivers! If you don�t believe me, go rent or test-drive one yourself!
