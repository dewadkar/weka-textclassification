            Well, since Christmas was here, and I was home with my family to enjoy the holidays, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a digital camera.  Admittedly, I knew almost nothing about purchasing a digital camera.  I investigated the features and options on a lot of different digital cameras, but finally settled on the Nikon Coolpix 880 camera.

What was it that made me choose this camera?  Well first, it's a Nikon, and for the most part, you can't beat a Nikon lens.  The second reason was that the camera can handle up to 3.34 megapixel images (non-interpolated unlike some of the other interpolating models on the market).  The camera also sports some the standard Nikon aperature-priority and fully manual modes (as well as an automatic point and shoot mode), which makes this camera great for someone starting in digital photography, as well as a great camera for the seasoned professional (or an amatuer that wants to explore the intricacies of photography with their camera).  

The only hitch I found while making my decision was that the camera did not come with either a rechargable battery, or any type of case.  Since I was buying a Nikon, and I knew the quality of the photos should be quite excellent, I splurged and put in the extra $100 to get the Li-ion rechargable battery as well as the AC adapter.  Since the entire purchase was in the neighbourhood of $1200 Canadian dollars, I managed to convince the store owner to throw in the case.

I didn't bother reading the manual, but instead fired up the camera and took about 10 high res picturs (the limit with the 8 megabyte compact flash card) and viewed them on the computer.  The results: absolutely amazing.  The clarity and colours in the photos were breathtaking.  I have taken a lot of pictures in my life (although most were taken from point and shoot type cameras), but these pictures simply blew me away.  

I've taken roughly 500 pictures so far on the camera, and the quality of each picture is staggering.  I was considering purchasing an SLR camera instead of the digital, but I'm definitely glad I went with the digital.
