            I was an intern last year with the Lane County Sheriff's Office, Springfield Police Department, and Eugene Police Department in Oregon.  While with the Lane County Sheriff's Office I worked with the accident reconstructionist on a number of calls.  While with him we were called to an accident involving a brand new 1999 Windstar and a 1998 Dodge Caravan.

The Caravan crossed the center line into the oncoming Windstar.  Both vehicles were doing 45 mph est. at the time of impact.  All five of the passengers in the Windstar, a 29 year old male, a 28 year old female, two small children and an infant walked away with minor injuries and bruises from the seat belts and air bags.  Everyone was not so lucky in the Caravan.  Three of the four people died on impact or on the way to the hospital.  The only survivor was the 9 month old baby in a car seat in the back.  

I have seen other smaller accidents with the Windstar where it performed nicely, but that gruesome one will stick in my head forever.

After that accident, my wife and I wanted to take a trip and rented a van.  We were lucky enough to receive a brand new Windstar from the rental company.  We were impressed with the handling and performance of the van.  Ford really looked at comfort when designing this van.  All of the seats have plenty of leg room and padding.  A/C was quick to respond and comfortable.

Our favorite feature was the four doors.  Both sliding rear doors were easy to get the kids in ad out of the car seats.  Another feature that we loved were the seatbelts and their ease to install the child safety seats.  

The one thing we didn't like was the heavy rear seat when you remove them to get bigger items in the back.  We have test driven many other vans and they all have the ultra light seats that were easy to remove.

All in all we both loved the Windstar and will be buying it in the next year.
