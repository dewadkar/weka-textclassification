            I have recently purchased a 2000 Ford F250 Super Duty, 4x4, Off Road, Extended Cab,Short Bed, Pick up, 7.3 turbo diesel. I owned a 1995 F150 4x4 Ext.cab Off Road long bed. Let me tell all of you about my truck. I was going on a hunting, trip in northern Michigan pulling a 22' trailer, the power of this vehicle is outstanding. With my old truck going over the Zillwaukee Bridge, which has a very steep grade, my 5.0 F150 no leader was loosing steam fast before the top. Now with my 2000 7.3 turbo diesel I have great power and pedal to go. What a TRUCK. The paint is Island Blue,new for 2000,it actually changes shades in different lighting. Royal green in the bright sun and deep blue at night,it's cool. Oh!, More to tell about performance. It had snowed 2&quot; and I was on my way into work, when I arrived everyone was complaining about how bad road conditions were, I laughed, Then I started to tell them that 2&quot; was sissy
man snow and I needed 2 FEET just to play in with my new Ford F250 SD 4x4.
I have also dressed it up a bit from the factory shape, it now has a chrome set of stepped running boards, with lights, a chrome brush/push bar and chrome dual tube roll bar with (4) 6x9 K.C. lights, boy it looks great. Tires to come.

What a truck. Good job Ford.<br><br>
