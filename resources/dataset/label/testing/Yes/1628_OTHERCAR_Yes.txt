            I bought my 2000 Prism largely on the strength of recommendations of consumer magazines that dealt with car quality. Among compact cars the prism always ranked near the top. I have only owned mine for about two months, but I really enjoy it. For a small car it really does have a lot of pep. I am happy with the way it rides on the highway, I have to keep watching to make sure i'm not exceeding the speed limit It rides so well. I have air conditioning and a nice sound system. I opted for manual windows, and out side mirrors. I'm the only one who drives it, so I figure once I get the mirrors  adjusted to where I want them I'm all set, so why spend the extra money for power. If I had It to do over, the only other option i would have bought Is cruse control. Maybe I can get that installed then I will be completely satisfied. The only other thing I would say is that the back seat does not provide a lot of room. Tall drivers should consider that if they are going to have a lot of people riding in the back seat.<br><br>
