            I have been a Mazda owner for the past 20 years.  I started with the Mazda GLC and have moved through the Protege, 626 and now own a 1998 Millenia.  It is obvious that I really like the Mazda line.  In addition to the Millenia, I currently own a 1994 Mazda Pickup and a 1995 Protege.  I am extremely pleased with the Millenia.  Of all of the Mazda products that I have owned, the Millenia is without question the most comfortable.  The sound system is second to none and the ease with which it moves is unbelievably quick and smooth.   So quick, in fact, that I do not recommend a young and/or inexperienced driver be put behind the wheel.  The seating is very accommodating.  At 5 feet tall I do not have any problem; however, my husband at 6 feet 3 inches is also impressed with the comfort.  Long distance driving is as pleasurable as driving around town.  I chose this model over Honda and Toyota for a number of reasons, but, a significant issue is the ability to negotiate the price.  Honda and Toyota do not offer the incentives that Mazda does.  The Mazda can easily be purchased well under sticker price, including all amenities.  This was not the case with Honda and Toyota.  My only complaint with the Millenia is the cup holder.  It is pretty tacky.  It is the only thing in the vehicle that is not first class.  There is plenty of leg room in both the front and the back seat, as well as a large trunk.  Mazda service has never been a problem.  Other than routine service I have not had any problems with any of my Mazda vehicles.  I highly recommend the Millenia and plan to continue my loyalty to Mazda.<br><br>
