            It has been called �The benchmark.� It is the best-selling car in America and has the highest resale value in its class. The Honda Accord won its customers by offering better than average performance, room for 4, good fuel economy and the guarantee that, if properly cared for, it would not break. This year�s Accord is no different.
I took the liberty of borrowing my Aunt�s 2001 DX for the weekend to rate this car, and see how much better it is than my lame 1995 Plymouth Neon.  The result:  I didn�t want to give it back.  Here are the rest of my findings about the 6th-generation Accord.
It is available in coupe and sedan bodies (I tested the Sedan DX)  The standard engine is a 2.3-liter 135 hp.   The LX and EX models have a VTEC engine with 2.3�150 hp. Or 3.0 v6 (200 hp). 


 The V6 is only available in automatic, not a problem for me, but �standard transmission� fans might care.
The DX�s 4 cylinder engine is nice, with decent acceleration and some power, but its no performance car.    The handling is great, steering is so easy its almost boring.
The car�s strengths are elsewhere.  This is a well made car and the entire interior is well assembled.  The dashboard is classy, unlike many small domestic cars, and there is storage room everywhere.  The car is spacious, comfortable and quiet.  Its excellent for a family of four.
Though it won�t catch the highway on fire when you drive past, it is a great car.  It has a good price, is spacious and comfortable.  It is still #1 on the compact car list.
At about $14,000  you can get the car, or you could get it loaded w/ a sunroof, leather, power everything and a CD player for about $22,000�
I checked EDMUNDS.com  for crash tests and the car did very well.  It passed all of the tests with GOOD or BETTER in every category except for a special bumper wreck where it was given ACCEPTABLE.
   If you�re looking for a compact car, I found it for you.
