            We bought our Chevy Blazer in 1998.  It is a lot of fun to drive.  We use to own a van that had more room inside, but was too slow.  The Blazer has a lot of power and you still sit up high inside so that your view is not obstructed.  We have not had any mechanical problems with our SUV since we bought it.  We drive it on long trips to Florida and Pennsylvania and find that we have enough room for our two teenage sons and all of their gear plus Christmas gifts.  It also has great gas mileage.  It really does make you feel safe when the weather is anything but pleasant.  I know I will make my destination without any mechanical problems.  The only problem we have experienced is inside the vehicle with a part of the dash and seating mechanism breaking.  The parts are made of plastic and seem to break easily.  I recommend all sports minded families to purchase this vehicle.  It's been great with our boys who play soccer.<br><br>
