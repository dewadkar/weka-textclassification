            The Lincoln Mark VIII may sound like a somewhat extravagant car for a seventeen year old to drive, but it's features and quality really do the job for any driver. I started driving this somewhat large sports car when I first got my license.  It is bigger than a mid sized vehicle but it was not hard for me to handle because I learned to drive on a big car.  The Lincoln Mark VIII has given me nothing but satisfaction. I feel safe behind the wheel because it is a larger car with dual air bags, anti lock brakes, power steering, an alarm, etc.  Also, the luxury and versatality are top notch.  Comfortable leather seats, a sun roof, cd player, and power everything truly make up this cars sumptuous side.  Since it's purchase three years ago, my Mark VIII has had absolutely no problems.  However, it may not be ideal to drive in the winter but it is a definite for summer cruising.  

This Lincoln drives smooth, handles easily, and looks great on the road.  Although it may not be the traditional teenage car, it sure is mine!  I could and would never ask for anything better!<br><br>
