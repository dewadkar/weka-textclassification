            This Christmas my parents purchased a digital camera and a photo printer for my computer.  I take my HP C20 Digital Camera with me everywhere I go.  It's great to capture those priceless moments with pictures.  The image quality is excellent and the best thing is, you can preview the picture before you load it on your computer or plug it into your printer anb if you dont like what you see you can delete write there from the camera!  You can adjust the lightness and darkness of the picture and you can zoom in a bit to see those somewhat smaller details.  It also comes with a video cable so you can hook it up to your television and watch a slide show of all the pictures that you've taken!  You can also take out the memory chip and plug it into your HP P1000 or P1100 series printer and you can select the pictures that you want to print out, and the qaulity is just as good as the local photo developing place can do! Amazing.  I Highly recommend this camera to families and people with kids.  It's Fun And Exciting<br><br>
