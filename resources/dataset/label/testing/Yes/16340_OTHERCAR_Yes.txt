            This is our first Digital Camera.  We wanted something easy to use, good quality pics, and reliable. This has all three, and to top it off it is compatible with out HP PhotoSmart Printer.
The camera stores a minimum of 16 photos (at highest resolution), and you can preview the pictures and erase any you don't want to keep using the LCD display on the back. You can also buy additional flash cards if you're going on a trip. 
It comes with a cord to allow you to download your pictures to your computer, however, in my case, I simply need to remove the flashcard and plug it into my printer.  This is a definite plus, since downloading can really eat up your batteries if you don't have a power adaptor.
It has 2x Zoom, built in Flash, with red-eye reduction, and also comes with Photo software, so you don't really need to go out and buy any expensive programs if you don't want to. It really couldn't be easier to use.
Photo quality is very good, especially considering the price.
Used in combination with the HP Photosmart printer, it really is the ideal set-up, for the beginner, or more advanced photographer.<br><br>
