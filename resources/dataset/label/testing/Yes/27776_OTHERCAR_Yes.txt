            I've had the S100 for about a month and I love it! I was previously hooked on the APS Elph camera but I wanted to go digital and get my photos online.

The best thing about the S100 is its size. It fits so easily in your pocket or purse, you have no reason not to leave the house with a camera every day. If you have children like I do, you know that having a camera with you comes in really handy.

The controls of the camera are very small and take some getting used to, but Canon did a great job of keeping the controls simple on such a small camera.

The camera comes with an 8MB compact flash card, way too small if you want to shoot high quality photos. I purchased a 96MB card and it's amazing! I can hold over 200 photos before transferring them over to my iMac.

The one accessory that I don't yet have but want is an extra battery. You can go through a full charge pretty quickly when you're taking lots of pics and viewing them on the camera's screen.

The 2 &quot;mexapixel&quot; quality of the S100 shots means that you can make up to 8x10 prints from the camera. I tried uploading to a few of the online photo sites and settled on Ofoto.com as the best. I found that site easy to navigate and the quality of the prints I ordered was by far the best. Regardless of which Web site you use, be prepared to wait a while for your photos to upload over modem.

Overall, a great camera that's a great introduction into the wonders of digital photography.<br><br>
