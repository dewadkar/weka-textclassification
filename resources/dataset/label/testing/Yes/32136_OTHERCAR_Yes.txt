            I finally pulled the trigger and replaced my old beater car I used in the winter with a 2000 Lanos. I'll admit I was leery of buying a Korean car because of bad press on other models like Kia and Hyundai, but I'm glad I did. 
The Lanos model we bought was the two door with auto transmission and A/C with only 11,000 miles for $7800. We looked at numerous used cars such as the Pontiac Sunfire, Subaru Impreza, Nissan Sentra, etc.. All these other cars had 50,000 miles or more on the odometer and cost more than the Daewoo did. Believe me, build quality on the Daewoo is better than the Sunfire. 
We took a long test drive in the Daewoo on all kinds of roads in all kinds of traffic and were pleasantly surprised by the comfortable ride. Despite the car's size, it's small, the interior is very roomy and well laid out. The seats are firm but comfortable and the steering is precise and quick. 
Acceleration is anemic, but we knew that up front. We do not abuse cars by driving the crap out of them like a lot of people do. They're too much of an investment to treat that way.
The ride is very pleasant for such a small car and it hugs corners like a mini sports car. Trunk room is larger than I thought it would be and it easily swallows a weeks worth of groceries. 
Fuel economy is good at about 30 MPG in daily driving, and we expect better on longer trips. For the first three years of ownership(I think it's three years) the dealer is supposed to pay for oil changes which should save a few dollars.
A couple of concerns are the unidentified rattle in the door frame. No big deal but it is annoying. The obvious worry is the fate of the Daewoo corporation who are supposed to be bought by GM. If GM takes over it will be a big plus, if the company can't find a buyer then...who knows?
I would recommend this car as an alternative to buying a high miles, used car by a known maker as I think it offers a lot of bang for the buck. What really sold me on the car is the opinions of the people on this site who enthusiastically recommended it. So far you're right. If something changes I'll revise my review, but for now take a chance on a good car from an upstart maker.
