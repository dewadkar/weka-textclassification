            I must admit that my first desire was to purchase an SUV.  I didn't like the idea of a "minivan" because it wasn't as cool.  Now I just laugh at all those SUV drivers because I know that they missed the boat.  I purchased the 1999 Montana with nearly every option available, including the VCR system with drop-down monitor.  That alone has been a lifesaver, since the kids now have something to do on long trips.  The vehicle drives so much nicer than an SUV- it really does drive like a car!!  I also love the fact that I get 21 MPG (on average) as compared to the 12-14 MPG that those SUVs are getting.  The extended cab option is also a must- it has so much room it is unbelievable.  The power door option is great as well and really helps when you have a full hand (UPDATED MAY, 2002: I HAVE HAD THE DOOR IN FOR SERVICE TWICE-BOTH TIMES UNDER WARRANTY).  I elected to get the "captains chair" option in the middle row and am very glad I did because the car seats fit very well in them and seem to sit in toward the middle of the car, which I think is safer.   

Maintenance

I have had the vehicle in for service a few times (now with 25K miles) but only for minor things.  I must admit that I was a bit skeptical to purchase a GM vehicle so I opted for the 100K mile / 6-year warranty with $0 deductible.  My "family-owned" dealership provides great service, however, so I can't complain too much.  Minor problems have included: padding in drivers' seat needed to be replaced/adjusted because seat was sagging to the right, volume button on stereo system not functioning, rear panel for inflatable air system not secured properly when first purchased, UPDATE: MAY, 2002, POWER SIDE DOOR NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY (TWICE), LEAK IN A/C COOLING SYSTEM, RADIO NEEDED TO BE REPLACED).  

Advice

I would advise anyone even considering a GM car to get a GM credit card.  You can earn up to $500/year off your next vehicle.  I actually saved over $5,000 on my Montana, since I had saved up points for several years (the current limit is $3500).  Also, you can negotiate the extended warranty prices with the dealer as well.  I think I paid about $1750 for the warranty.  WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THE CAR, BUT ONLY IF YOU PURCHASE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.
