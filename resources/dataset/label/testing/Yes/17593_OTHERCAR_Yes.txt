            The Neon isn't a luxury car - not by a long shot.  If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  But if what you want is a reliable and somewhat room compact car at an affordable price, the Neon is one to consider.

The Neon could, admittedly, have more room in the back seat.  Adults will find it slightly cramped, but kids should have no problem.  Adults in the front seat should find plenty of room.  The seats are comfortable enough for a few hours drive, but probably not the greatest for long-distance road trips.  There is quite a bit of trunk space, but again, probably not enough for long-distance road trips with families.
                             
In winter, the Neon handles poorly on snow and ice.  Other times, however, the Neon handles fairly well.  Steering is somewhat loose, but control is certainly there, even around turns.  At freeway speeds, however, you can definitely notice a decrease in the level of control.
