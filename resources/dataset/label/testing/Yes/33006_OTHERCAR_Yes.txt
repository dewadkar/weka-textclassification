            In 1990 I decided to purchase a new truck. I had been looking for quite a while and finally I decided to take the plunge. It was a 1/2 ton extended cab pickup with a 350 engine, loaded with power everything except seats. It has bucket seats. Well it is 10 years later and I have over 263,000 miles on it and the only major repair was a transmission at 150,000 miles.
I have since looked at the new ones but have not decided when I will take the plunge as my current truck is not done yet. I think the GMC truck is the best value out there because for the use I have gotten out of the one I have. I will definitely buy another one. The only thing I recommend that I feel that has prolonged the life of my truck is I change oil every 3000 miles. The new trucks are really great looking and improved in the way they ride and handle. With an extended cab, it is like riding in a car because of the long wheelbase. The interior is just like a luxury car. Gmc makes the best trucks in my opinion.
I had over 200,000 miles on my truck and I took it to Canada and to the East coast pulling a camper without any problems. Over a 3000 mile trip.
I plan on taking it on a long camping trip this year pulling my camper with over 263,000 miles on it.
The new trucks have even more room and ride better than my old truck does.<br><br>
