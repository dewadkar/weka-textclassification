            The Lincoln Mark VIII not only looks like a responsive, high powered sports car, it is.  I fell in love with the Mark VIII back in 1992, but didn't purchase one until 1997.  

The car is powerful, quick off the mark and very stable at high speeds.  The one drawback I have found is the rear end is too light for the power available to the drive wheels and the car has a tendency to fish tail on quick starts or slick pavement when you try to accelerate too fast.  However, on straight and level the car performs exceptionally well at high speed.  

The fuel economy was another pleasant surprise.  At legal highway speeds, the Mark VIII provides 23 to 25 mpg.  

The cockpit is designed where everything the driver needs is in easy, safe reach.  The sound system is superior.  The car is essentially a four passenger automobile, however, the back seat passengers must be small to be comfortable.  There is very little leg room in the rear area for passengers, but then you don't really buy a Mark VIII to haul extra passengers, do you?

All in all, I would recommend the Mark VIII as a &quot;Best Buy.&quot;  Since Lincoln decided to end production of the Mark VIII, I strongly suggest you find a top quality used one and invest in the future.<br><br>
