            I have really enjoyed this car.  It is very reliable.  I drive about a 40 minute drive to work every day and this car is outstanding.  Great gas mileage, lots of passing power.  It is a great value.  I purchased this car with about 26,000 miles on it.  And have driven it an additional 50,000 miles in a year and a half with only 1 visit to the oldsmoblile dealer for small repairs.  The car has everything.  All power, cruise, tilt wheel, 4 speed auto, traction control, ABS brakes, am/fm cassette rear spoiler, rear defrost, and much more.  The 3.1 V6 is very fast peppy.  The only thing I did't like with the car was the full wheel covers so I put on some nice chrome wheels.  Wow!  What a great looking car.  White exterior with 4 doors, a rear spoiler, and sparkling chrome wheels.   I would recommend this car to anyone, that is looking for a nice car.<br><br>
