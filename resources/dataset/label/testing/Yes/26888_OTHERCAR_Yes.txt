            I was one of those people who swore off children, and the ever worse "twinky van". I have since changed my tune, had a child, and will NEVER be without a van as long as I can still drive!

Now I'm not saying that Mini-van drivers are for families only, but that is the main reason I HAD to have one. With the fear of being attacked from behind while shopping alone with my young child, and those children I was babysitting, I needed a vehicle that was easy to load - children and packages. I just slide open the side door, put everything/everyone in, close & lock the door behind me, and have a safe haven to settle the everyone/everything in.

My Dodge Grand Caravan just celebrated it's 10th birthday, and I've only been an owner of this particular vehicle for one year now. I purchased it from a family member who had it for about 5 years prior.

My Caravan has many extras that basic models don't come standard with. The original owner of this vehicle stock loaded this van for almost every convenience:
***ABS brakes
***Air conditioning
***Automatic transmission with overdrive 
***Power Windows - front drivers & passenger side windows as well as rear wings.
***Power door locks on passenger and drivers side window control area
***Auto locking doors with child-proof lock on side door (can not be opened once the key is turned on to start vehicle) Put running vehicle in gear, and the doors auto lock.
***Open door alarms as well as a visual on the drivers speedometer area dashboard
***Leather seats - Front two are bucket, and second and third area seats are bench with six liftable arm wrests...
***Lumbar support - adjustable to support your lower back (button located on side of driver's seat)
***Electronic adjustable driver's seat - raise, lower, and tilt for your comfort
***Cruise control
***Rear wiper with washer & defroster - buttons accessible from driver's seat on the side of the speedometer
***Infinity Digital stereo with 10 programmable station presets; a clock, and equalizer - infinity speakers - six total throughout the van with the option of moving the sound to front or rear or centered***KICKING STEREO - if you pull up next to me at a light, and there are no children in my car - you'll hear the bass rumbling through my windows. Unbelievable sound for a car stereo from the dealership!!!
***Over the shoulder seat-belts for six passengers, and two extra lap belts for center seated passengers (totaling eight possible passengers)
***Third seat can fold down for extra storage.
***Eight cup holders (including two in front that retract under the stereo, and two bonus holders in the fold down glove box)
***One pullout storage drawer hidden under the passenger seat - lockable!
***Intermittent wipers - front and rear - both with washers
***Front and rear heat/air control buttons (Rear controls are located in second seat behind driver)
***Storage pockets on the rear of the two front bucket seats
***Manual wing windows in the second seat area - one on sliding door, an one on driver's side. Manual push/lock arms.
***Hidden storage areas in the arms wrests molded into the side walls of the interior of the van in the second and third seat areas. (Push button/release type)
***Spare tire inside the van - hidden inside the wall behind the third seat area.
***Durable/washable interior carpet that really retains piling with tremendous traffic. (I pre-treat with shout or resolve, then shampoo - and comes up pretty clean for a light gray carpet).
***Easy to locate (on the side of speedometer area) hazard, headlight, defroster, and wiper buttons. 
***Gas tank low alarm, as well as a gas door release button on the side of the driver's bucket seat.
***Manual on/off map lights located in the front and second seat area - totaling four.
***Overhead storage for cassette tapes, and a sunglasses holder
***Digital outside thermometer, MPG gage, and travel miles located above rear view mirror which all can be set with one touch settings
***Tilt wheel
***Rear hatch release button on driver's side driver panel

Can you tell that I LOVE THIS VAN?

A few things that may seem petty, but are sometimes a nuisance are as follows:

Gas door release is hard to get to when the door is closed. Very tight fit for your arm!

Sunglasses/cassette storage areas open with very little pressure, and can really hurt your head if down when you don't see them and hit them.

Doors can be locked by small children even if the key is not in the ignition - IT DOES HAPPEN - CARRY A SPARE!

Over the shoulder seat belts are right at the neck level for shorter/small framed people. The belts often jam when retracting, and can get caught in the doors if not retracted right.

Recalls notices in my case where not received from the company.The power brakes went on my van, and I almost had an accident. I was never notified by Dodge that my van had that recall. My brother luckily has access to look up recalls at his job, and he found a list of them on my year/model van. Isn't the company notified by motor vehicles who currently owns the vehicle????

LEATHER SEATS ARE HOT!!! Especially in the summer - no matter how cold the air conditioning is, skin to leather contact results in sweat!

No place to really secure grocery bags. Purchase a net for behind the third seat, or put the bags between second and third bench seats on the floor and pray for no fast/wide turns!

The clear coating that is over my base paint on the entire vehicle is now flaking off ESPECIALLY the roof, and hood area. Every model close in age of the same make seem to have the same paint problem. Dodge should volunteer to fix the obviously flawed paint problem - that'll be the day!!!

Sand, dirt, food, and whatever else kids/passengers drop onto the floor end usually ends up in the seat securing areas - where the seats attach to the floor and they lock in. Try fishing gummy bears out of there...impossible!!!

Other than my few petty complaints, this van has been a reliable form of multi-passenger transportation for my family and myself. My particular Grand Caravan has 133,000 miles on it, and has very little engine noise. We do change the oil 3,000-5,000 miles, and try not to let gas tank go below 1/8 of a tank to prevent that "kick-up" of misc stuff that ends up in your gas tank. Check the fluid levels, make sure the battery cables are secure and clean, and drive carefully! What else can we do?

I don't want to think of the day when my vehicle and I will part! I do know that if we do have to go our separate ways, I'll buy another Dodge Grand Caravan! Comfort, convenience, and peace of mind!!!!
