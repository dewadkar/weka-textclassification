            The previous generation S4 was an excellent car and a huge commercial success in certain countries, stealth looks, top quality, adequate performance. I own one, and decided not to upgrade to the new model V8. Here is why.

Esthetics: the new A4/S4 design is not controversial, but it still gets a little bit on the massive side. Aside from the alloy spokes, the chromed mirror housings and the lower door skirts are the main differentiators versus a mainstream A4, but I don't find them particularily tasteful.

The interior is downright superb, both in terms of design and quality. Layout is rational, the finish and touch of materials is superb.

Turn the engine on and there is an obvious change from the smooth humming of the biturbo V6, you now have a deep throated drum beat. As you get rolling, the drum beat stays, I prefer humming/howling engine exhaust notes.
The engine is very potent, for a naturally aspirated engine there is a fair amount of low end torque, but the sheer low revs grunt of the V6 biturbo is gone. The lag time is gone too, but floor it in 6th at 2000 rpm and nothing much happens (on relative terms), while after a second, the V6 would pull you away relentlessly. Max torque is the same (slightly higher according to datasheets), but reached 1700 rpm higher. In real life driving, it does not kick in as ruthlessly as it used to.
The flipside is that you get superb high end behavior, while there wasn't much point in taking the V6 way above 4000 rpm in normal driving.

Audi went to great lengths in press teasing to claim that the V8 engine was not heavier than the outgoing V6. The end result is still that the car is noticeably heavier, by almost 200kg per Audi's specs.
This, combined with the high engine displacement make the new S4 V8 a rather thirsty animal. Expect a good 30% increase over the V6 in similar conditions. Add the fact that the V8 tends to push you towars higher revs while the V6 was enticing you to drive it "on the torque" and the gas bill could end up being pretty significant, at least in country where gas is not as cheap as water.

The handling is well sorted, great motricity, contained body roll, but this is a heavy car which will just eat front rubber if you start digging into the limits. This is where there concept of having a 344hp sports car that heavy demonstrates its conceptual limits on winding roads. High gravity center, high weight, heavy nose, you'll be left behind by many cars which are way less powerfull, but more tossable. More important than raw A-B speed, the pleasure is hampered by the constant reminder that every corner is eating your budget.
Audi is presenting the car on race track pitlanes, it should be featured on highways.

Brakes appear to be potent, let's hope that disk warpage will not be a seminal problem as it was on V6's.

Overall, this is a very good car. If you are shopping for a safe, all-weather fast car, it's difficult to find credible competition. However, one may wonder what the high-displacement V8 marketing argument brings to the party, except weight, power consumption and, depending where you live, higher taxes and insurrance premiums. Throw in a price tag which ballooned up and doubts arise.
A good purchase ? Probably.
A good upgrade ? I don't think so.
