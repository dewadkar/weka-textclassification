            This was a car owned by my dad, which was sold not too long ago. It was one of the last C4's purchased, and GM had an unbelievable giveaway incentive on them. Purchase price listed below is only an estimate. I'm not really sure.

Overall this is certainly the best of the C4 generation Corvettes. This one was black on black with the removable top. LT-4, 330hp, 6speed. Definitely very quick, with slugs of torque way down to 1300 rpm. It revved freely and definitely had more of a top end charge than the regular LT-1, but both my pop and I felt that some extra top end power would be cool.

I did a world record burnout in this car, it must have been at least 150' long.

Handling was good, with tons of grip, and well sorted suspension damping. Steering was numb though, with virtually no feel. It also lacked linearity, meaning numerous tiny corrections are often needed in long turns. Not the precise nature one would hope for, but we could deal with it. Transitional behavior was quite good and body roll very minimal. Brakes were very strong with no fade and not much nose dive at all. 

Body structure was a curious issue! When it was warm out, and the top was on, there were virtually no squeaks from the interior and the structure seemed nicely stiff. In cold weather, the squeaks appeared, which was more amusing than irritating. Remove the top though, and the body loses some structural integrity which manifests itself with high frequency jiggling. The car definitely wanted to be driven in relaxed mode with the top off, as cornering poise took a hit with the top off.

The transmission functioned well, with the shifter travel being very positive. Shorter throws would be nice, but its not a critical need. You could do a neat trick with this car, at 55mph you could drive it in 5 different gears: 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th. 2nd saw about 5200rpm, and 6th was at 1200rpm or so. Neato.

This car got absolutely amazing highway mileage. A consistent 27mpg at 75mph in 6th. Remarkable.

Ergonomics were its shortcoming, the early 80's design manifests itself in a very high transmission tunnel and high door sills. Your right arm sits at an odd angle in relation to the shifter. You have to kind of throw yourself into it instead of simply sitting in it. The new C5 version has addressed these issues.

In the first 26K miles of its life (2 years) there were absolutely no reliability issues at all, a nice surprise for a GM product.
