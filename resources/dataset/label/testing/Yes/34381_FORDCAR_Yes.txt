            I bought a Ford Taurus after my station wagon finally broke down. I was expecting much less room for hauling items, but found that the trunk for the Taurus was very roomy! I could easily fit a playpen, double stroller and other various bags and baby equipment in it. The back seat is very roomy also. I have fit 3 convertible child seats in it and while the seats were touching, the doors still closed without touching the seats. The only thing that I would like to see is more slots for tapes to be stored. I really enjoy the flip out center console. It is wonderful for drinks, but the top drink holder does not work well for anything smaller than large drinks. Overall, I think this car is a wonderful investment for families!!<br><br>
