            <i>This review is written for the average consumer who really doesn't want every specification on a product. This is for the people who just want to know the basic features that they will probably use, and how the product works.</i>

When I first started shopping for a digital camera, I wrote up a list of criteria that I wanted. 

1. Most important it had to be easy to use.

2. It had to have a memory card for storing pictures. I did not want carry 3.5 inch disc's with me.

3. Had to come with an easy to use download program for retrieving the pictures from the camera on to my computer.

4. Had to be small enough to fit in my pocket. 

5. Had to have a zoom lens.

What I finally purchased was the <b>Olympus D400 Zoom</b>.
Within an hour, I was taking pictures and downloading them on to my computer to e-mail to all my friends. 

<b>Setup</b> 
The only setup needed to be performed on the camera was to put in the 4 AA batteries for camera operation, and a small watch battery for storing the days date. Setup on the computer was equally easy. Hook up cable to a serial port on the back of my computer, and then run the installation program. Done in under 5 minutes.

From the first picture I took, I was truly amazed. I had heard that the quality of pictures taken on a digital camera was no where near the quality of pictures taken with a 35mm camera. I was taking portrait pictures clear enough to see individual hairs. That was much better then I ever expected.

<b>Features</b>

This is a list of features that I have used and how they work. What I like about them, and what I don't.

1. <b>3X optical zoom with a 2x digital zoom</b>. The 3 power zoom works great and really brings your subject in close. I have learned that if you go to full power on the zoom, it will take the picture slightly out of focus. What I do is zoom in all the way, and then back off on the zoom just a touch. The extra 2X digital zoom gives you a 6 power zoom, but loses a bit in sharpness.

2. <b>Electronic Flash</b>. There are four different flash modes with this camera. Red-eye reduction, fill-in flash, auto low light/backlight, and forced off. I use the red eye reduction flash when ever taking pictures with live subjects. I still get the occasional red eye, but only when the subject is at a bad angle.

3. <b> Three separate setting for the quality of pictures.
Standard Quality</b> that gives you the most pictures between downloads and is about equal to 110 camera photos.

<b>High Quality </b> which gives you fairly good quality but not great for portraits. I use this setting for parties, outdoor events, and nature shots.

<b>Super High Quality</b>. This is the setting I use for portrait pictures. Has been known to give to much detail at times (every blemish and misplaced hair show up in perfect detail). 

4. <b>8 MB SmartMedia Card</b> This card stores your pictures on it until you download them on to your computer. It will store 122 images on standard quality, 36 on high quality, and 18 images on super high quality. You can purchase SmartMedia cards that hold more pictures, but I have not needed one myself yet. 

5. <b>Delete</b>. Yes, when you get a picture that you didn't want, push two buttons and it is gone. Saves room on the SmartMedia card for the pictures you want.

6. <b>1.8 inch color screen to view pictures</b>. I use this to make sure I took a clear picture before moving on to my next subject. You can turn this on while taking pictures to use the 1.8 inch screen as a viewfinder.

7. <b> Macro lens</b>. Allows you to focus in on subjects 4 inches away. Great for high detail nature pictures up close. 
 
I have had this camera for two years now and have yet to have a problem with it. It has been left in the glove compartment of our car in extreme heat, and used in the middle of winter while skiing down a hill. I would love to buy one of the fancy ones that does mpeg videos, but my wife won't let me until this one breaks.
