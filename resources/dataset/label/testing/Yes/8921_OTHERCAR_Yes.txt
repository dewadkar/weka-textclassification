            I recently had the pleasure of purchasing a 98' Dodge Grand Caravan.  It has wonderful features such as Power windows/power locks/valet key entry/ two side doors/ fog lights/ rear wipers/ defogger front and rear glass/ driver &amp; passenger heating/ dual air controls front and rear/ removeable seats/ driver and passenger side airbags etc.  I am well pleased with my purchase and have found this to be a most comfortable ride.  I have heard many people in the past critizie drivers of mini vans and have heard comments that people can't look cool driving one.  I'm sorry to tell you but all of those who said that are dead wrong.  If anything, you'll look &quot;cooler&quot; than the others, especially the guy still running around in the 82 Chevette.  Besides the basic benefits of this vehicle it is also a very comfortable ride.  I no longer dread driving down the road, but rather enjoy it.  I have found that the seating in the Caravan is comfortable even when riding in the back.  My children love the Caravan because they can enter from either side of the vehicle. I love my new Caravan and every single feature that comes with it.  
I must say that I have been spending about $30 to fill it up.  I'm sure this is partially due to the gas prices right now, but still something that one must look at when making a vehicle purchase.  Other than this, I can't find much bad to say about it.  I enjoy it and I hope that I'll continue to enjoy it for years to come.   <br><br>
