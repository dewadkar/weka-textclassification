            I originally bought this car as a replacement for my 2000 Ford Focus ( see those 2 epinions elsewhere). 
I still think the Focus looks fresher than the Beetle, but the VW gives something the Ford never could, a sense of security.
The Beetle handles like a dream I have yet to spin out in this thing, and believe me, I should have , many times ! The brakes seem a little soft, but with the 5 speed you can down-shift to compensate for that.
The interior still amazes me after 6 months of driving it around. With the back seat down I was able to fit a 27" TV box in the hatch and still close it, with room on the sides for the accessories I also bought.
The dash is really sparse, especially after driving the Picasso-esqe Focus. The entire display is made up of the speedometer, gas gage, and, tach. It's all light up in that spooky, Indiglo blue, which was a little distracting at first, but now when I drive other cars they seem sort of bland by comparison. The other controls like the radio and temp, are lit up in red, which offers a bold contrast to the blue instrument cluster. So the interior is more interesting to look at at night.
The seats are firm but yielding, typically German. I can drive for hours and not need to stop except for the necessities.
The outside is quite charming. If you park next to an original Beetle you really see the size difference. The new ones look like they've been on steroids. The headlights and taillights are HUGE. It is very tall and easy to spot in a crowded parking lot full of cookie-cutter Japanese cars.
I highly recommend the silver paint job, dirt doesn't show on it at all.
New on the 2001 model are improved side mirrors. The first New Beetle models had ungainly, almost square mirrors that were placed too high and were a serious design flaw. The side view is still obstructed by the thick side pillars, but all you have to do is buy some 2 dollar blind-spot mirrors and you've solved that problem.
Can any of you who drove old VW's can remember trying to find reverse gear for the first time ? Well, I guess the volks in Germany needed a laugh because they brought back that curious feature in the new Beetle. Down, to the left, then up where first should be. Very strange. I almost took off in first gear several times the first week I had it. I like nostalgia, but come on. 
If you don't feel comfortable putting actual flowers in the dashboard flower vase, it makes an excellent pen holder.
