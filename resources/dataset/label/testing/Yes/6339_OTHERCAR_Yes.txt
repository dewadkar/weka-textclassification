            We recently had GM's "24-hr" test drive on a V8 SRX with the luxury performance package (1SC); this vehicle included the DVD nav system, Bose speakers, Xenon HID headlights, AWD and Magnetic Ride Control.  This one also came with the third row seat. 

Thoughts:

V8 engine - tons of power, takes off great on a freeway onramp, especially for a relatively big vehicle.  The 0-60 time is in the mid-6 second range and it feels like it.  Very refined sound.  Reminds me of the Lexus SC400 I used to drive.  We also test drove a V6 right after we returned the V8, and although the V6 had plenty of power, the V8 made the SRX feel (and sound) more like an expensive luxury car (though it is a little pricey at about $4-5 thousand more). 

Exterior fit and finish - panel alignment, paint, and overall fit/materials looked great.  Obviously, not every SRX produced is going to be perfect, but we couldn't find any flaws on the one we test drove.  It felt very solid and well put together.  The SRX shares a lot of components with the CTS; we'll see if the high marks that the CTS has shown for quality will carry forward to the SRX.  

Interior fit and finish - we liked the materials and the layout.  After we put the 2nd and 3rd row seats down, there is a LOT of room inside of this vehicle.  Definitely plenty of utility. Even with the 2nd row seats up, there still is plenty. With the 3rd row up, storage space in back is MINIMAL at best (a few grocery bags, etc.).

3rd row seat - having read a lot of critiques about the lack of usefulness of the 3rd row seat, we were surprised by actually how much room there is. It would NOT be very comfortable for someone 6 foot tall on a long trip.  But my wife, at 5'6", had no problem sitting back there, certainly if you had 6 adults to go out for dinner or whatever, the 3rd row seat would come in very handy. For us, with a 9 and a 7 year old, the 3rd row seat will be very useful on those trips out with the grandparents.  Seems to be in line with its competition.  

Brakes/handling - the braking on this vehicle is excellent. I've always thought that a lot of SUV's have had somewhat soft brakes, the SRX is an exception. It stopped like a much lighter vehicle.  I guess the 12.7" rotors do make a difference.  The magnetic ride control is great, the handling is very predictable and tight, especially for something that weighs around 4 and a 1/2 thousand pounds.  No excessive body roll.   

Nav system - found it easy to use (though had to reference the manual once or twice).  I understand Cadillac has developed a 1SD package for the SRX that will split the Nav system away from some of the other options such as AWD or Mag Ride Control in an effort to make the options easier and cheaper to purchase.
