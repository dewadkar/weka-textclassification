            We purchased this type of vehicle for the same reasons as most others; CHILDREN.  It fills the bill as a commuter vehicle and the kid shuttle.  The Villager was chosen because 1) they're aren't a bzillion of them on the road 2) we liked its exterior styling more than the others 3) we got a good deal (the real clincher!!).

We're generally happy with it.  It does what it's supposed to without fuss.  But it is an unexciting vehicle to drive.  There is nothing distinctive in it's ride, handling or comfort.  The engine is peppy, emitting a surprising growl when pushed.  It will get you to highway or passing speed in a seemingly un-minivan manner.  Once there, however, it's back to being 'normal'.

There have been minor non-mechanical problems, which the dealer readily repairs (when he has the right parts).  A recurring window latching problem (2nd row, drivers side) has yet to be corrected.  And,you may notice, a number of Villagers, including ours, are experiencing problems with the drivers side brake light.  The dealer will fix it.....when he gets the part.

Despite it's blandness, I'd recommend the Villager, particularly if you get a good deal.  It doesn't outshine the other offerings, but it isn't overshadowed either.<br><br>
