            My husband and I purchased a 1995 Plymouth Neon because it has more head room than most cars in it's price range, and drives beautifully.  My husband is over six feet tall and I am five feet tall, so we are always adjusting things, the drivers seat and the mirrors especially. (I highly recommend the power mirrors).  We special ordered our Neon with every available option except the automatic transmission.  I especially enjoy the standard transmission in this car.  We live in an area with lots of hills, and for the first year or so we had an on going contest to see who could coast the farthest, (this car has almost no drag on the engine when it is in neutral).  It corners better than any car I have ever had, it has plenty of power, and it gets great gas mileage.  It has only needed one repair, replacement of a factory recalled part, and the work was done by the dealership free of cost.  I recommend this car for people that want an affordable, dependable, comfortable car.  It is seats four people easily, a fifth person will fit but the center of the back seat isn't comfortable enough  for long trips.<br><br>
