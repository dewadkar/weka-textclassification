            Don't get me wrong.  I have very few complaints about our 98 Camry.  It is infinitely better than the piece of junk it replaced.  We bought this car after our 93 Plymouth Colt ES was totalled in an accident.  We got 3 times the amount of money for the Colt that I would have given for it.  We went shopping and looked at a few Oldsmobiles.  We were about ready to buy a Cutlass when we decided that we should at least LOOK at a Camry.  We did and were impressed.

(If you want a Camry go to one of the dealers in Atlanta-we drove there from NC-they have 2 distributors fighting for the territory and several dealers have more than 150 Camrys on their lots at GREAT prices)

Our car is now 2 years old and it has developed several suspension rattles that I will eventuall have to have looked at or go crazy.  That is the only problem so I may be just a little spoiled by Toyota now but...

It is at this point that I wonder--Should we have considered the new Jetta or Passat?  Volkswagen appears to be in the position that Toyota and Honda were in the 80's and early 90's.  Quality is excellent and reliability is too.  Plus Audi seems to be sharing some of its industry leading good looks with its less expensive baby brother.<br><br>
