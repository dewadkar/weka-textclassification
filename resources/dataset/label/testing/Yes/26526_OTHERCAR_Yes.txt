            I recently ordered a 200 S-10 with the ZQ8 suspension and the 4.3L V-6.  I test drove the dealer model more than four times before finally making my final decision.  What can I say- I love this truck.  The Ford Ranger didn't even have a chance when compared to this truck, and as for the Dakota, well, its a Chrysler-nuff said.  From my test drives, I can tell I'm going to love my new truck.  I got all the options except for the extended cab.  I figured it wasn't really worth the extra 1500dollars canadian for an extra couple feet of space.  The truck handled great with the sport suspension (better than my Cavalier) and had plenty of power to spare.  The only thing I worry about is the gas mileage.  Many people seem to say that the mileage on the V-6 sucks.  Well, I guess if thats the price to pay for the power, I'll have to live with my decision.  Now, if only my truck will hurry up and get here.  It's due sometime in May, and I'm going nuts in anticipation already.  I can't stop looking at the brochure. (Check out page 4 in the 2000 brochure- the red ZQ8 is identical to what I ordered) All I can say is I'm glad I ordered the Chevy over the Ford.  I managed to get every option on my S-10 for less than a base model Ranger!  Everybody cross their fingers and hope my S-10 gets here sooner for me.  Thanks!<br><br>
