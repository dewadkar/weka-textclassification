<B>Comfort and Amenities:</b><HR>Very comfortable.  The leather was soft, the wood was rich, and the car just gorgeous.  Bose speakers make a large difference.  It is a basic mercedes, but still...beats any Toyota or Nissan!  <br>
<B>Performance and Handling:</b><HR>Again, wow.  Ok, it handles well.  I mean, the 240 is the smaller engine, so maybe, just maybe, a lil more power would be good.  But, the high torque makes up for it.  I mean, I dont have a problem with .( but, I am coming from a V-6 SUV...hmmm).<br>
<B>Safety:</b><HR>Its a Mercedes...what more can I say?  There are enough airbags to make the car resemble a padded asylum. My mother is even pleased...so it must be good.<br><B>General Comments:</b><HR>Hmm, this car is FANTASTIC.  I saw an ad for it, right after I ripped the bumper off my Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd.  So, I was in the market.  I went to the dealership and, WHOA!  So, I fell in love...quickly.  Since I am recently single, its a good thing to fill that void.  The car is superb.  Handling, styling, value, everything - perfect.  I dont say that really.  I have hated most of my cars.  Haha.  This one, I hope and feel, is different.  So, I ordered one.  They told me it would take 4 months to get it in, the way I wanted it.  So, I talked to another dealership, they said 2 months.  So, I ordered one from each...lets see who delivers sooner!<br><br><br>
