            If you want a rugged 4x4 that will take anything you throw at it, and keep proforming, Nissan's New Xterra is for you. It was designed by Nissan to break the stereotype about S.U.V's being nothing more than big station wagons, I purchased a Xterra two months ago, Since then i have taken it offroad about 10 times, and on two occasions it outproformed a hummer!
this truck is built solid, and the range of aftermarket accessories is amazing. For a truck that wasn't designed to be a luxory vehicle, it sure has a comfy interior.
check out www.myxterra.com to see the capabilities of this amazing S.U.V
the on and off road handling is amazing.
