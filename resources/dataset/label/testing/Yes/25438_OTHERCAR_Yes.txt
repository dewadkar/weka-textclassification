            I bought a fully loaded sedan (4d) new while on the market for a used Honda.  I had really wanted to buy a Honda, but when it came down to price and I realized I was going to buy a Honda with lots of miles for the same price, I figured I'd go with the Lanos new with their great 5 year warranty.

So far, I'm moderately impressed - I would be happier in a Civic, but my wallet would be much lighter.  This car is very "economical" - it doesn't strike me as out-and-out cheap (like Saturns do) but it is evident that the primary goal when they built this car was low-price.  The "power mirrors" is actually only the passenger mirror, the driver's side is manual.  The power locks is actually that all the door locks are controlled by the key in the driver's door.  Keyless entry isn't even an option.  Despite the great warranty, potential buyers need to keep in mind the fact that there are not yet a lot of dealerships, so getting the car serviced might be a hassle.  Mostly an annoyance, the cup holders are terrible.  Basically, you're stuck with the "medium" size if you hit the drive-through.  Last, the seats in the back fold down, but not very flat, so you get some additional room from the trunk, but its not very useful.

On the positive side, this car handles very well.  In addition it is pretty roomy for its size.  The Civics are much roomier, but they have a much bigger footprint too - the Lanos is very small, but the designers made <i>excellent</i> use of the space they have.  The trunk is actually pretty spacious and the back seats, while not luxurious, are not bad at all.  The gas mileage is very good and the other features are generally up to par.

On a side-note, I got <i>excellent</i> service from Daewoo.  The marketing pamphlet they gave me said that power steering was included in the fully loaded version.  After I picked up the car it wasn't there, and they realized it was a misprint and factory power steering wasn't available at all.  When the regional sales director for Daewoo (not the dealer) found out, they installed an after-market power steering system at their cost!

Given that most of the negatives above fall under the category of annoyances, rather than serious deficiencies I think this is a very good car.  Basically, with this car you're trading thousands of dollars in savings for the inconvenience of the items above.  In my mind, it is a tradeoff worth making.
