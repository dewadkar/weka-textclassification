            I have been in love with this car since I bought it. Looking at it from the outside, I thought it might be bigger than what I wanted. When I got into the driver's seat it did not seem as big. This car handles like a dream! I love the way the Turbo V-6 sounds when you take off. Plenty of power.
 
   The interior is very nice. Very comfortable and roomy. There are air vents to the back seat so your passengers don't have to wait to get warm or cool. Everything on the dashboard is very accessible to the driver. The only thing I don't like is the ashtray. Whoever designed it obviously did not smoke! It is too deep with a very small opening.    There is a pass through in the back seat from the trunk. I have never used this since there is plenty of trunk space.

   The thing I love most about this car is the safety factor. The doors automatically lock when you put the car in drive. You don't have to worry about someone getting in or your kids opening the door while you are driving. It has driver and passenger air bags. It has been named as one of the safest cars on the road. I have peace of mind when I load my precious cargo (my family) into this car and that is worth everything to me.
