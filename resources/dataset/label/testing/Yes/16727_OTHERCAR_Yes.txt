            I purchased the 400 GT because I wanted a 12 cylinder Ferrari and couldn't afford a TR at the time. I also had a 1986 328 GTS at the time. The 400 GT is a 5 speed with a front engine V-12 with 6 sidedraft Webber carburators. The sound made by this engine is wonderful and made the ownership well worth the service cost. Driving the car was a pure joy although most people didn't recognize it as a Ferrari at first glance. It was fast for the size and time of the car with few 1976 cars able to come close to its overall performance. It had a back seat that had plenty of room for two average to small people. The only thing I can say bad about the 400 is the high cost of service. Those 6 webbers were had to keep in sych and not cheap to have adjusted. This is the Ferrari to buy for someone who wants a 12 cylinder Ferrari, needs a back seat and can't afford the cost of the newer 456. <br><br>
