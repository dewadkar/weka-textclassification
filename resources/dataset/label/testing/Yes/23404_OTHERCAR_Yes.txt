               I have to say I've been a fan of this new breed of Oldsmobile ever since it came out. What's not to like? Sleek styling, brand new 3.5-liter engine, competitively priced, and to top it off, it's <i>American</i>. It's come a long ways since the '80s Delta 88s. 
  It's been much touted in auto magazines as, finally, a real competitor to the class standard-bearers the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Knowing this, I just <i>had</i> to drive one and see if it was truly going to &quot;Start Something&quot;.
  

   Let's start with the exterior. I <b>love</b> the looks on this car. It's handsome, sleek, sophisticated, and artful, with a tasteful dash of sportiness thrown in for good measure. It brings the word 'curvaceous' a whole new meaning. I don't think there's a straight body panel to be found on this car. Starting from the catlike front fascia that graduates to the sporting flared 'shoulders' to the round and roomy cabin that evenly flows into the muscular rear 'flanks' of the car into the beautiful jewel-like taillights. The car is gorgeous.  It's sleek without the stubbiness found on the Alero and even the new Aurora.
 
  My model was a '00 Intrigue GL sedan, in a gorgeous forest green metallic color with the neutral leather interior. It had generous-sized P225/60R16 aluminum wheels that looked quite handsome on the car. It also had foglights, twin chromed exhaust outlets, and the optional spoiler to sweeten the deal. It was sharp looking.
  
  The interior carries on the sporting/upscale theme by it's simpleness and logical placements. Some of the dash plastics looked, well, a bit <i>too</i> plasticky (i.e. door handles), but that would be my only complaint. It has easily readable white on black gauges with all the necessary information, including a tach(!). The speedometer goes to 140mph, and the tachometer goes to 8000rpm, but redlines at about 6500rpm. The stereo/CD/tape player was right where it should be, above the climate controls, and sounded pretty good. This car also had the dual climate controls which was really nifty and was really nice to have a different setting (whether you wanted it colder or hotter) than the passenger. I made full use of this and promptly turned it down to lower 60s as it was very hot out. The steering wheel is nice and beefy and has the oh-so-neat redundant stereo and cruise controls on it. The leather seats were really comfortable, bolstered in all the right places, but I found they really weren't as sporty as you would think they'd be as this is Oldsmobiles' &quot;sport sedan&quot;. I don't have any qualms with them though. I like all the little engineering details, such as the way the auto shifter handle fits so nicely in your hand, and is even sloped down. I think the idea is if you're using the armrest you can just use the handle as a rest as well. There are large map pockets, and a nice little cup holder in front of the transmission with a little cubby in front of it. It's just a little <i>too</i> close to the transmission though, watch the bigger, or more awkwardly shaped cups while you're in 'park'.
  
  The view from the front is great, you can actually somewhat see the hood on this car. Great for tight maneuvering and parking. It's roomy without feeling like a Lincoln, and just cozy enough to feel comfortable. A perfect medium.

  It rode like I was expecting it too, firm but forgiving on the rougher spots. I felt in tune with the car in terms of ride. The steering is another story. I thought it'd be more communicative than it was, and while precise, it's a little heavy on all but highway speeds. Very nice long distance cruiser, I got the impression it'd do 80mph all day long and be quite content.

  This car is fitted with Olds' brand-new 3.5-liter Twin Cam V6 making 215 horsepower (@5600 rpm) and 230 lb-ft of torque (@4400 rpm). More than Accord and Camry. I liked the engine, although not as much as I thought I would. It had more than enough grunt, and propelled the car quite nicely, and doing so rather quietly and quickly. Maybe that was the problem; the engine felt just a little <i>too</i> refined for my tastes, as a sportsedan. However, I feel that most will be pleased with the engine and it's refined nature. The 4-speed auto is a good one, shifting almost imperceptibly, as a luxury car should, and getting the power to you when you need it.

  Gas mileage is commendable at about 19mpg in the city, and 28mpg on the highway.

   Overall, I feel it fits it's image as a sportsedan, albeit more of a ES300 type sportsedan rather than a 3-series type, placing a bit more emphasis on luxury and sophistication over flat-out performance and fun. However, I think Oldsmobile has done a fantastic job with this car, and will change many people's minds on buying a more common Japanese make.
