I bought his camera a little over a year ago.  I bought it because it uses 3 and 1/2 ince floppies instead of a memory card. This camera is easy to use my 10 year old even takes good pictures with it.  It is great cause I don't have to wait to have the pictures developed. This was especialy nice when we had a Tornado go through and I needed pictures for insurance.  I could take the pictures and have them printed off in just a few minutes.   My ajuster was very impressed and was going to try to get the company to switch from the poloroids that they are now using, which cost about one dollar per pic and besides the pictures I gave him he took about 1o more.  <br><br>
