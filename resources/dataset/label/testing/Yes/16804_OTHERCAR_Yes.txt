            I bought the 1999 Chevy Camero Z28 because I wanted to stick out and bring back the kid in driving.  The Z28 has is a lot of horsepower for dollar.  It has 305 Horse Power and can do a top speed of 160+.  I has great handling, good looks and can all be bought for under 30 grand.  A big set back in this car is that it has very high insurance rates, especially for males.  I recently took my Camero to the drag strip and ran a 9.32 at 81 miles per hour in the 8th mile.  That's pretty darn good considering I drive the car everyday.  I would advise people of young to middle age to buy this car, but don't try to use it as a family car or you will have a few crushed kids from the small back seat.<br><br>
