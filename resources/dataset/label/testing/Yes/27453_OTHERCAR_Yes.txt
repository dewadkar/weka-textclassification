            I have a 95 dodge Neon. This is a nice car with plenty of Horse power packed in it. Unlike the civic the Neon actually speeds up when going uphill, whereas the civic when going uphill u can notice the speedometer going down. The 95 neon sports model comes with 132 HP which is about 10HP less than the Honda Accord DX and 15,000 cheaper on your pocket. The Neon has plenty of room in the front and the back seat. The 95 model did not offer power windows so I ended up with manual stuff but its not too bad since everything is within reach and easy to operate. The trunk is pretty good sized. It gives about 25-28 miles per gallon for freeways, the newer models come with more HP and better mileage and have a more forward cab design. More options available with the new Neons. For the price it is a pretty nice american car. The resale value on this car isnt' much, like any american car, but it is packed with power and fun.<br><br>
