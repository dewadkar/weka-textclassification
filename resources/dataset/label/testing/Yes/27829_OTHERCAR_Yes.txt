            I am happy overall with the purchase of this wagon.  I have owned several Subaru 4 Wheel Drive wagons over the years, and this is by far the best one yet.  This vehicle is perfect for hauling kids, cargo, and camping gear if you prefer.  It has All Wheel Drive to get through the worst conditions, and gets impressive gas mileage as well.  The engine is smooth and quiet, and the car handles very well for a wagon.  Expected reliability is high, which is very important to me.  I own a 2000 Nissan Maxima and have noticed that some of the materials used in the construction of the Legacy are not up to the standards of Nissan.  The Nissan uses better interior materials and has an overall better feel of quality.  I paid only a couple thousand more for the Nissan and feel that it is a better value for the money.  I still recommend the Subaru for its value for the dollar.  Although it has its shortcomings, there is no other vehicle available for the price that can haul as much, as efficiently, safely, reliably, economically, and through any road conditions than the 2002 Subaru Legacy.  My wife LOVES the car and that's important to me too!
