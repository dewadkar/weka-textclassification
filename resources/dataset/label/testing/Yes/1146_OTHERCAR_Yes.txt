            The 2000 dodge neon

This is a great looking car best in silver looks good any color but this car i call Bad Boy because everytime i drive it i want to go fast and it gets alot of looks.accelaration is great and traction is alright ive drove better but the neon is a great car it is easy to drive has a great factory radio and funky windsheild wipers.The sterring wheel is to skinny for me a man but great for the ladies.it is easy to get out of though places and it stops good on the snow but dosent want to take off in the snow very well the price is resonable but what happend to the cheap neon i guess they grew up alittle compared to the old style it is a great car and would recomend buying it if you dont smoke if you do it is hard to flip ashes out the window and easy to burn stuff overall i would rate this car a 3 it is a somewhat smooth ride lovely car!<br><br>
