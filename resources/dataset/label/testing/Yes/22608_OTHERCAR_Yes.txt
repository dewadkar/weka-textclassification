            A manual, 1.8 liter 1993 Corolla DX has been in my family since it&#146s birth in September 1992.  We were one of the first to purchase this then-new body style, and have not been let down in 11+ years of ownership.  My parents gave the car to me in 1999, when I was in college, to replace an older Camry.  At that time, mileage was 52,000&#133the car was garage kept and basically new.   Today, the car has 144,000 miles on it, and I still drive it.  I&#146m well out of college, in graduate school and have been a working professional for 3 years now.  Believe me, I can afford a new car.  But I just love Rolla.  I lock my locks and roll my windows, but there&#146s something regal about being content because you know you&#146re driving one of the best production cars ever made &#150 that&#146s paid for mind you.  My Corolla has taken me all over the east coast, to beaches, to Manhattan, and to a million other places with a smile.

In the 11 plus years I have known this car, the only thing to go wrong with it has been an alternator, starter (both common problems to the 93&#146s and 94&#146s) and a clutch master cylinder (another common problem to all manual Toyotas).   Other than those parts, it has been oil changes every 3000, some spark plugs, tires, and one set of brakes.  This is truly an economical car to drive &#150 any easy on the environment too.  While people are out getting 12MPG down hill in their Durangos and Denali&#146s, my mileage with the 1.8L has consistently pushed 40 on highway trips; even mixed driving with the A/C on will get you well above 30MPG.  Try doing that in your American SUV with over 100k on the odometer.  

A few FYI&#146s&#133Don&#146t be fooled by the smaller (1.6L) engine available on base models &#150 I have driven it too with a manual and there&#146s a noticeable lack of low-end power that I have with my car.  Also, this engine only comes mated to a 3-speed auto if that&#146s your preference, a combo that will sharply decrease both your performance and fuel economy.  Also, expect some suspension noise when cold, my car has been making such noises as long as I can remember&#133do a little driving and it goes away.  Highway noise is reasonable for an economy car, sans the engine, which at anything above 70mph is north of 3000rpm.  This can get tiring on long trips, but you&#146ll still get there with little drama.  The Corolla&#146s brakes aren&#146t bad &#150 Toyota&#146s have never been known for their braking abilities &#150 a quick turn of the rotors and new pads will help you get the most out of what you&#146ve got.  Handling is good, much better than some brand new American cars I&#146ve had as rentals here and there&#133sure they&#146re fast off the line, but take them into a turn and you&#146ll have to change your pants.

One thing that really impresses me about the Corolla is the quality of the interior materials.  The interior really does rival cars costing much more, and after 11 years (half of which has been out of the garage) there are no rips, discolorations, cracks or wear marks on any of the interior parts.  Even the floor mats are in good shape, considering the abuse they take.  With regard to the interior, overall space that is present is usable, and you&#146ll be surprised at the things you&#146ll be able to cram into such a small car.  I took a 27&#146&#146 flat screen TV home in the front seat with little effort, although as you load the car it&#146s responses become somewhat lethargic.  This car is no rocket ship, but in an era where horsepower and speed have once again gained a strong following, my car seems content to keep pace with traffic.  This is a great car for anyone.  So great I&#146ll probably never sell it.  But if you&#146re looking for a truly excellent car for very little money, pick up one in good shape and enjoy.  These cars will easily run for 250,000 with a little love.
