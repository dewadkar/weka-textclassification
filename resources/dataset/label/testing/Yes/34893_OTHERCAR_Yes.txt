            After a 5 month stint on the waiting list, I recently took delivery of my new 2000 Honda Odyssey EX.  I have been primarily a sedan owner in the past, and as I now have a small child and another on the way, I took the Mini van plunge.  I purchased an Odyssey after considering the Toyota Sienna and the Dodge Town and Country, ending with the Odyssey primarily due to Honda's reputation for quality as well as the numerous glowing reviews of this van.  I love the fit and finish of this vehicle, the smooth, powerful V6, and the simple utility of the instrument panel.  It is a pleasure to drive, the seats ( I added leather from the dealer) are quite comfortable, and the much talked about &quot;magic&quot; seat is ingenious .  I have yet to find anything about this vehicle to dislike, although the gearshifter in the drive position blocks the radio controls, and the speakers could have been of higher quality, both relatively minor flaws.  Driving the Odyssey reminds me of a nimble armored car...it really is a heavy (4200 lbs +), solid feeling vehicle, yet not bulky or bus-like.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a big, well-built mini van with the Honda quality customers have come to expect.  It was worth the wait   <br><br>
