            I wanted a new car. I'm a young professional and my tired 6 yr old Honda Civic just didn't cut it anymore. I needed a car that conveyed success without being overly flashy or intimidating. Something that was fun to drive, had an excellent stereo, low maintenance, and affordable.

I checked out the Honda Accord and the Nissan Maxima. I'd just driven a Honda for the past few years and was nonplussed by its pathetic stereo system. I mean, part of the joy of driving is listening to music. So unless I wanted to install a custom stereo...Honda was out. I'd heard Nissan had a great stereo...but when I looked at the Maxima...it just seemed to have an awkward design. They don't look especially sporty and if I can compare cars to people, it looks like it's got a "big butt". It just wasn't sporty enough or classic enough for what I wanted. 

Besides, everybody has these cars. They aren't unique or special in any way. True, true...they run like champs and are affordable, but I wanted something that was unique.

I found what I was looking for in the Infiniti G20.

It's an affordable luxury car with a great stereo and excellent service plans. It's sporty, yet "professional". I liked its looks and I like the way it handled when I test drove it.

I'd found the car I wanted...now I worried about the "haggling". I'd been harrassed and intimidated by both the Nissan and Honda salesmen. This was the 1st time I'd bought a car without any help. I worried they would rip me off or pull something over on me. I did my homework and went in to Infiniti expecting the salesmen to be just as "in-your-face" as Honda and Nissan. To my amazement, they weren't. They were so polite. No stalking me in the showroom, no condescending witty banter, no outrageously gorgeous salesmen to try to win me over by flirting. In fact, I had to hunt them down. And that's the way I like it.
I told them what I could do and they told me what they could do and we got it worked out in under an hour.

They even gave me a loaner car to drive home, until mine was ready to be picked up!

A nice car, a nice buying experience, nice service plans...I'm a fan. When it's time for another car...I'll see Infiniti first.
