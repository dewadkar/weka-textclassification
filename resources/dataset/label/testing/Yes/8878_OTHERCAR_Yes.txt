            As soon as I saw a few Eclipse convertibles in a dealer�s lot, I just knew that I could not walk away without driving one home.  The body shape is just stunning. It feels so good to cruise around my town with its top down.  It definitely catches peoples' eyes.  I am personally very disappointed that Mitsubishi ended this body style starting with their brand new 2000 models and this new Eclipse does not look half as good as the old one.  

The handling of this vehicle is just outstanding compare to my other sports cars such as Toyota Celica or Nissan 240 SX that I used once own  (those cars are known as direct competitors of Eclipse).  And this car has an incredible acceleration for a four cylinder sports car with 145 hps engine.  The fuel efficiency of this car is probably about 21-28 miles per gallon on average.  You just have to drive this to know how good it feels. 
How about reliability?  I have had this car for about a year and half and I have not had any problems since. Actually, this convertible shares many of the same parts with Chrysler Sebring, which basically keeps its repair cost lower than regular imported cars.   

I guess the only bad thing that happened to my car was that someone tried to break-in and slashed my top. But this is a very common incident for a convertible owner.  If there are any points to improve on this car,  I will suggest the following:  The size of back seats is not enough to give a comfortable ride for two adults.  The very low car body makes it very easy to scratch the lower part of the body.   Finally, those sports type suspensions are not suitable for any rough country roads.  
Basically, this is the best convertible for a single person who wants to catch peoples� eyes.
