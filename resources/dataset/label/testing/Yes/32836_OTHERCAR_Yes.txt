            I own a 95 Cavalier. It just turned 132,000 miles. I paid $9800 for it. It has no options at all on it....not even a radio. But it is simply a great car. It does just what I bought it for, and still today people comment on what a nice looking vehicle it is. It's great in the ice and snow.

There is no telling how long or how many miles I will put on this car. My last car was a Geo Spectrum and I had 230,000 miles on it when my daughter-in-law totalled it. General Motors is certainly doing something right these days. If the influx of Japanese cars didn't do anything else, it woke up the domestic car manufacturers. For the price I couldn't find a better car than my Cav. It gets great gas mileage and it has not spent one minute of time in the mechanics shop.....not one second!.....Change the oil regularly and forget about it. I haven't even changed plugs yet.

Cavalier is just a great compact car for the money.<br><br>
