            I am a 39 year old female who teaches second grade and my daughter just graduated from high school. I thought it was time I did something for me. We were past the need for mini-vans and station wagons. All my friends drive sport utility vehicles but that is just not my thing. I went to the car dealership to buy a Mustang but when I saw the silver 1997 Z28 Camaro with black t-tops my daughter talked me into driving it and the rest is history. It really ROCKS! I have owned it since March and I may be getting old but I love the way people look at me when i drive it and the kids at my school think I am so COOL! The t-tops are so easy to pop on and off. One draw back is that when I go through the auto car wash occasionally I get a few drips through the tops. It is an 8cylinder and I have never had so much power.It is so much fun to drive this car! Surprisingly, it does not get any worse gas mileage than those stupid vans we used to drive. It uses no oil.The back seat is not that comfortable so if you need a car with passenger room this is not it. I was afraid insurance would be high and it might for younger drivers but for me it hardly raised at all. I would not recommend put your teenager behind the wheel of one of these, too much power. But if you are having a mid-life crisis like me, I say GO FOR IT!<br><br>
