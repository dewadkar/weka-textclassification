            The Nissan Pathfinder is the best SUV that I personally have ever driven.  I leased two of them.  The first was a 94 and the second was a 96.  I originally got the first one because of a bad winter we had in 1993.  This particular winter my little RX7 got stuck in or on any amount of snow or ice that it came upon.  I knew that I needed something to survive the next winter due to lost work time.  I first tested several other 4x4s.  The first was a Jeep Wrangler.  Some others were Blazers and Geos.  Before I made my decision on what to buy I check with Consumer Reports on the safety and reliability of the vehicles.  My favorite was the Jeep till I read about its unreliability (a score of -113) and it had an easy ability to roll over making it one of the highest death Rates in this kind of accident.  The geo was also easy to tip over and the blazer rode like a rock.  I continued my search till I came across the Nissan Pathfinder.  CR. said that it was extremely reliable and was among one of the safest SUV on the road.  I then test drove one.  I like it and then though about it.  Luckily my sister had a friend who had a 93.  He happened to roll it over in a stupid high-speed turn around a corner.  He walked away without harm.  I knew what I had to get one.  The visibility was Excellent, the ride was comfortable, and the vehicle had a lot of legroom in both the front and in the back.  My only problem with the 94 was the tire rack on the back of the vehicle.  It did block my view.  I even got rear ended in it and the damage to the Pathfinder was small compared to what the car behind me suffered.  It did take a month to get all the part to replace the damaged parts.  When I got it back it still rode like it did before.  

     Soon the 96s came out and I had to get one.  I needed a new one due to the improved safety features.  Unlike the 94 the new one had dual airbags, front and rear crumple zones, a new safety cage, 20% more room inside, a more powerful engine, better visibility (didn't have a rear tire rack), and it had a new sleek look to it.  I like all the new features and the looks.  It even rode better.  This vehicle got me through everything including the blizzard where we got three feet of snow.  What could be better?  Eventually as luck would have it I got rear ended again (twice).  The first one held out even better than the first one I had.  In late 99 it came time to turn it in.  AT this current I didn't lease another one but when I can afford I will buy the next one.  I have never had a vehicle that was so reliable.  If you are going out to get one I recommend the Nissan Pathfinder.  You will be happy with this choice
