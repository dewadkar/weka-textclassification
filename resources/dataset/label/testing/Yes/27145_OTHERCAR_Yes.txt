            The Nikon E-Series professional digital cameras are often overlooked in the world of pixel pushing. I have used the E3, but most of my experience has been with the earlier E2. Both cameras are essentially the same, but the E3 has some upgrades to the optics that give a lower (numeric) f-stop ability.

I bought the E2 mainly due to its WYSIWYG view finder. Some of the other cameras in its range make you squint through a mask to see what the image is going to be. This is due to a difference in size of the CCD imager versus the size of a 35mm frame. The lenses used on these cameras are all based on 35mm cameras.

The Nikon doesn't have too many frills, but it is a real workhorse. I used it daily for over two years and never had a failure. The images were excellent and it is hard to argue with the quality of the Nikon lenses. The quick release batteries and full sized PC-card storage made for a professional product.

The bad side is the camera is that it is based on the F4 and the auto-focus is pathetic! The sensors need to be cleaned on a regular basis. The battery life is only acceptable and it helps to have a few spare sitting on the charger.

The software that comes with the unit is bad at best, but you learn to cope with it.

The camera has been eclipsed by newer models, but the price has also come down. If you need a good solid performer, the E-series is a good choice.<br><br>
