 I bought my Kia Sephia used in May of this year. Prior to us having it, it was owned by Enterprise Rental Car. It had 7685 miles on it when we bought it. I first want to say that this has been an overall good car.

 It has had some problems but has turned out to be a good car once we got the problems fixed. At around 8000 miles I noticed that if idle the car would die. It only did it once in awhile at first but soon this became a ongoing problem several times a day.It would also jerk into gears at different times and not want to go into gears at other times.

 Since it was still under full factory warranty I took it into the dealer where they ended up replacing the whole transmission. Ever since then I have had no problems with it dying or anything else like that. 

 I did get a recall letter in the mail yesterday. It was something about a fuel cap. I have to take it to the dealer next week and get it serviced for that.

 But overall I would recommend buying the Kia but I would also recommend buying it new,not used. My car was used as a rental car so I have no idea how it was driven before I had it. <br><br>
