            I'm outing the PT Cruiser.  

Sure it looks retro-riffic, proving once again that Mopar, unlike GM, knows how to build good-looking cars.  And with the big tires and wheels and 4 wheel disk brakes options, along with the 5-speed stick, it can gobble up highway miles at a ticket-attracting pace.

But beneath the pretty package, it is really a practical little wagon that can reliably carry up to 5 people and/or a fair supply of cargo.

Practical:
I am sure you have read all about the 32 possible seat configurations, and the 6 different positions for the rear shelf-thingy (only 5 of which are approved for use while driving).  Of course you might wait a while before letting your friends catch on to just how large the interior is; especially if they need help moving something big and dirty.

Likewise it is a reliable little gem, starts and runs easily, with no squeaks, rattles or mysterious thumps.

The interior color is called 'taupe'.  I guess that's marketing-speak for 'practical dirt-hiding brown'.  The plastic parts are robust and the fabric is sturdy, designed for long utility.  The switches feel solid and reliable.  My only quibble is that the rear seat is provided with only 1 cup-holder; but I don't want the kids spilling soda in the back seat anyway, so one cup holder is OK for now.

The seats are comfortable, good padding, good support, and a nice high perch.  Even the back seats are comfortable, there is enough room in the back seat for me to sit behind me, which is a rare event in something this easy to park.

Climate control is good.  AC and defrosters do a good job; the fan is only noticeable on the high setting.  Only complaint: There is no way to run defroster and dash vents simultaneously.

Driving:

Popular wisdom is that the PT Cruiser has no power.  BULL.  The little 2.4 litre twin-cam 4 is plenty powerful if you do two things:  1) Use the manual transmission; 2) REV IT.
Off the line the engine is weak, but get the tachometer past 3500 and the power builds; by 4000 there is a muted roar and a rush of acceleration.  Just be sure to up shift before 6000, or the rev-limiter will kick-in and spoil the fun.  At highway speeds you can lope along in high gear, with the revs way down, so acceleration suffers; but 4th gear (or even 3rd) is just a flick of the cute-little-cue-ball-shift-knob away.  Best of all, the cops, like everyone else, have heard that these things are slow, so maybe they won't believe the numbers on their radar guns.

Of course it can be pricey:  When I take it easy, I can get 25mpg; when driving aggressively 21mpg.

Steering is responsive (nearly 'twitchy') and has a good road feel.  Handling is nimble and predictable, with a little bit of torque steer at high revs.  Body lean is well controlled, but feels worse due to the relatively high seating position.  Low speed parking-lot maneuvers are complicated by a wider-than-expected turning circle caused by stuffing a lot of tire under a small car.  You'll get used to it.   Braking is impressive, the combination of fat rubber and 4 wheel disc brakes do a fine job of scrubbing off speed.

The transmission has well spaced gears, not optimized for road racing, but more appropriate for an economical people mover; so to keep it the engine revs up in real power territory you have to push nearly to redline before upshifting.  The shifter, aside from the nifty round knob, suffers from that typical fwd rubbery feel; expect to miss a few shifts getting used to it.  A bigger flaw is the clutch placement and motion, which at first felt awkward and tiring in stop-and-go traffic; it took some time to find the right foot position for rush hour.  (There is a handy flat spot to the left of the clutch pedal, just perfect for parking your left foot when you are covering highway miles.)

Gauges:  I wish it had a couple more gauges; oil pressure and ammeter gauges would be nice.  But maybe I'm just being a Neanderthal.  Until the 7yr/100,000 mile warrantee runs out a 'check engine' light and a temperature gauge are all I need, right?  It's not like it's a sports car.

Overall:  Notice that the category 'Tall Wagon' is filling up.  There is the Ford Focus wagon (which, from behind, looks just plain -wrong-), the We-Be-Hip Toyota Matrix, and the Pontiac �MeToo� (which can claim to be the least ugly Pontiac).  All of them are inexpensive, practical combinations of flexible interior space with compact exterior dimensions.  These are real 'sensible shoes' cars.  

The PT Cruiser is a sensible, economical, practical Tall Wagon, but with distinctive looks that make it an attractive choice for anyone trying to hang on to some shreds of hipness, without making a complete fool of themselves.
