            Got the 1990 Dodge Caravan SE V-6 in the summer of '93, Since then our family has put 90,000 miles on it without any real major problems.  I learned to drive on this vehicle and quickly caught on to the power and ease of handling.  Granted it is not hard to get a mild chirp out of the tires on a harder than average turn, the van holds the road quite well.  The roominess has allowed us to carry everything from fence posts to loads of furniture for my apartment.  

The only real downside to this vehicle is the presence of mild body roll around turns, this can be attributed to the shocks which are often either worn out or not heavy enough.  This van has gone through three sets of front struts, (get the ones with lifetime replacement warranty) and two sets of rear shocks.  With new struts and shocks, it handles like a dream.  The main reason for the excessive shock wear is constant hard driving on curvy two lane roads in northern California.  

Overall the van has been good to us and will still bring a relatively good trade in price should we choose to get a new vehicle.  The Dodge Caravan is a reliable vehicle with good all around comfort and versatility.<br><br>
