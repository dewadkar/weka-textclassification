            In Nov 1997, I purchased the 1998 model of the plymouth neon for my wife , and now i realize that it just might be one of the worse decisions i ever made, not only was it a bumpy ride but it also seems to have more problems that maybe the company needs to address. The car seems to pull to the left at times, when theres a strong breeze you can really see how badly the windows are installed, and to top matters off after just two years of ownership, this month 02/18/00 to be exact, I had to turn it in for of all things to have the head gasket replaced. When i got the invoice from the maintenance dept, it also showed exh kit, nut hex, bolt hex, spring exh, coolant c, gasket pkg, sealer se, coolant c, which now makes me wonder if chrysler/diamler knew when they built these cars that they were cheap knockoffs of the car of the past the volkswagon beatle. I not only hate this car, but I also plan to trade it in for a pontiac grand am . I also declare  that Iwill never buy another chrysler/daimler made vehicle, esspecially the neon, and that at every given opportunity I will save somebody from making the same mistake when it comes to purchasing a car.<br><br>
