            Can you stand it car lovers?  The Dodge Viper is revolutionizing the sports car industry!  How do you feel when you see a Viper driving down the road - I know how I feel - I want to pull up next to it and see who's driving!

The Dodge Viper GTS and Dodge Viper RT/10 are the two models available to the Sports Car Lover.  Both the GTS and the RT/10 make 450 horsepower in its powerful V10 engine.  Aside from the excessive spinning of the tires on the take-off, the Viper will be sure to give it's passengers wiplash!  A zero to 60 time of 4.8 seconds is truly a marvel.  The Viper's interior is nothing to be to excited about, being a car for racing, what did we expect?  The Viper's optional Alpine stereo upgrade is a wonderful system to rock out with while you're driving.  The seats will only comfort you for a couple of take-offs, then you'll feel some slight pain in the rear.  It doesn't matter though, the VIPER is awesome!  Extreme power in the hands of the American driver.  

The Viper's gas milage is not to even be considered when buying the car.  You can just assume that you will be spending a fortune.  The fuel tank is only able to carry 19 gallons of gas.  Also, you will get all of 11 miles per gallon in the city and 20 on the highway!  HA!  Don't even think of taking this car on a road trip - unless you're Jay Leno, or Kelsey Grammer - both Viper owners!  ONCE AGAIN - who cares about gas milage when you're purchasing the most electrifying car on the road.

The Viper will also enhance your actual complextion - no matter if you're ugly or not, the Viper is a sure fire way of picking up women.  Therefore, just be ready to have your weekends taken for the next five years that you're paying off the Viper.  The only problem is, you'll be taking them out to Steak &amp; Shake for dinner cuz you're BROKE AS A JOKE!  Then again, STEAK &amp; SHAKE makes one of the best hamburgers, so it's not that bad.  

Edmunds.com calls the Viper &quot;value-priced.&quot;  Well, I don't truly think that 70,000 dollars for the Viper is value priced, considering that the Mustang Saleen with a MONSTER 500 horsepower V8 is the same price.  True, the Viper will get cha more looks, but for the true sportsman - the Mustang will take the Viper on the 1/4 mile.  Lighter and faster.  IT STILL DOESN'T matter though, the Viper attracts more women - so that's what's important, right guys!  Girls - you know it!

Anyhow, the Viper comes standard with passanger and driver's side airbags and anti-lock brakes.  A sports suspension that will bump you in the ceiling if you hit a speed bump to hard - but will allow you to take corners at 50 mph like it was 20 mph.  Traction control is not an option -HA!  Who wants it!  The interior is nothing to marvel at - it's a race car!  There is not much cargo space so no traveling either - and no golf clubs.

Aside from all the down points - the Viper's good points outweigh by a landslide - so if you've got the flow - the VIPER is the way to go!<br><br>
