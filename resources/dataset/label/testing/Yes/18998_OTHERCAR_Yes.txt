                  After reading several write-ups and test drives of the new 2003 Hyundai Tiburon, I decided it was my turn to see what all the hoopla was about. I have a solid history of driving Japanese imports over the last 25 years for contrast and hopefully may render an accurate evaluation. 
      I was immediately impressed with the looks of this car, not as bumpy as the previous smaller model and while still striking with  its wedge sculpted (Mustang-like) doors and hood, it seems the perfect fit for the next generation Tiburon. Hyundai over the past few years has undergone many changes in its Top staffing and design team and are closing the gap with it's japanese competition (Leaping way  ahead of their Korean compadre's)with  each new redesign since 2000....and selling lots n' lots of cars as a result. Anyway, back to the Tiburon....I was impressed with the value of the V6 GT (Infinity CD/Cass. 7 speaker system, Leather seats, side impact airbags, Michelin tires, and a various assortment of transmissions including a new specially mated 6-speed manual, 5 speed man. or a 4 speed automatic which has the Porsche invented Tiptronic shifting capability....and if your lazy like me, and drive in traffic like I do, you may opt for the automatic. The Tiburon is very easy to drive although the ride is quite stiff over bumps. It handles corners  without  much fuss (although lighter competition may score a bit higher) and is actually quite fun to drive. The car is no lightweight, at over 3000 pounds it's one of the heaviest in its class. But I will mention this car feels solid and tight....and for about $19200+ taxes etc.,  you can get one with your color choice, Auto or manual, sunroof, leather, power everything, and the best factory warranty of any car on the market (5 years bumper to bumper/60 months). This car is can be had for $4000 to $5000 less than a comparably equiped Toyota Celica GT-S (that's about $100 less payment per month on a 5 year note!). I liked it so much I bought a silver GT Automatic! The engine is smooth and very quiet, hard to even hear it idling and yet the growl of the  dual ex-haust (windows down) can be heard with just a small press on the gas. There's great torque on the low RPM with this car, which means you don't need to get it up to high rev's to get meaningfull power, and nice tight  steering.  
    All in all, it's a nice sport coupe, (small children only will fit in the back seats) and the rear seats do fold down for long objects. I was surprised how roomy the rear hatchback area was for such a small car...we got 10 bags of groceries in that rear area without any trouble at all (not folding the back seats either!)
