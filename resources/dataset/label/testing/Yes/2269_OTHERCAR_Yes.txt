            I bought the Amigo hardtop last September and absolutely love it. You really can't argue with the warranty which includes roadside assistance for 36 month/50,000 miles and can be upgraded, I got 72 months/100,000 mi. I drive in all sorts of weather conditions in New England, including sand and dirt roads in backwoods areas. I work as a Visiting Nurse in a small town and need something reliable and easy to park in tight streets and this more than accomplishes that. It's really comfortable and I've been on several road trips, some during snow storms and felt comfortable and confident all the time. I got the V6 engine and it's a bit overpowered, watch it pulling out of a gravel driveway, your wheels will spin if you try to rush and it uses a bit more gas than my Mitsubishi LRV did, but still in the 20mpg range. It puts the economy versions of itself such as the Tracker and the Sportage to shame, along with the Honda's glorified station wagon the CRV but the price showed it. Although it's expensive, I was more than willing to pay for the reliability and versatility. It can be noisy with the windows down but does have two sunroofs that aren't noisy at all when cracked, they do come out altogether but I have not tried this. It's roomy enough for four adults but does not have a lot of cargo space, with the back seat folded down and tumbled forward there's more than enough for a week's worth of luggage for two. It did not at the time anyway, come with factory installed A/C or Cruise control but I had these installed by someone else and these things never work as well when put in by someone else. 

I do not normally rave about products like this, see my other opinions, but this deserves it.<br><br>
