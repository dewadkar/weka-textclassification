            Love:  Isn't that what drives so many of our impulses? Admittedly, I am a romantic, but I also have a strong practical side and seldom make really impulsive purchases, especially when it involves what is to me a lot of money. But life takes unexpected turnings.  
   On the first afternoon of a trip to Arizona, a wildly erratic tach needle turned us from our direct route to Twin Falls and sent us to Boise and the closest Subaru dealer, where we met with the usual competence and courtesy we have come to expect in Subaru service departments.  As we had at least an hour to wait while our alternator was being replaced, I looked around for something to do.
   The service manager invited me to sit in a new 2000 Outback which was parked in the service area.  Immediately I noticed the upgraded sound system with a six-CD player installed in the dash, and pulled a Bocelli (my other love) CD from my purse.  (Some of us never travel without him.)Midway through &quot;Con Te Partiro&quot; I called for a salesman, and before we thought it possible we had said goodbye to our old Outback, which had carried us faithfully for over 102,000 miles, and were on our way in a new Outback.  This being our fourth Subaru wagon in ten years, we didn't find it necessary even to test drive it!
  My husband, who previously had preferred the handling and maneuverability of a regular Legacy, was amazed and impressed with the way the new car drove.  The gas mileage was excellent, and it was by far quieter and smoother-riding than previous cars.  Now, 3000 miles later and still far from home, we are more than ever pleased that impulse and practicality combined to give us a great buy.
   Now, after 6000 miles we are back on our incredibly bad, twisty mountain roads, and happier than ever that we are driving this new Outback. It takes the curves with ease and the potholes seem to have disappeared. The excellent gas mileage helps take the sting out of the overly high gas prices, and we certainly enjoy the admiring looks and compliments we receive on the car. And, when I am on a country road, I can put back the moon roof, open the windows and turn up the stereo, and almost believe I'm a kid again!<br><br>
