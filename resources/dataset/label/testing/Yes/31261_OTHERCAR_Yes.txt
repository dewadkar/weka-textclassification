            With a sporty look and luxurious features, Pontiac just might have well 
landed their most popular mid-ranged car. For the individual seeking a 
sporty car without the sporty price, the Grand AM GT should be 
considered. It's 6cyl. 3.1L(95') engine pushes just enough power to compete with a stock Mustang. It's tight handling suspension makes cornering almost as tight as a 98' Mustang Cobra. The transmission and gearing combo sets for quick acceleration and smooth shift points. The body design on the 2 door GT allows for some nice add-on features to bring out it's sporty style.WHILE Pontiac gave this wonderful car a sporty look, they also gave it a LUXURIOUS feeling. It's handling is tight, and it's ride is quite smooth and quiet. The four door option allows for the sporty style to accommodate a family of five with ease, and the 6cyl. engine allows for good gas mileage and excellent pick-up off the line. Reliability on the car (depending on the year) ranges from Excellent (1995-1997) to somewhat reliable (1990-1994)(Consumer reports). As long as regular maintenance is kept up (oil change, tune-up etc.), the car can expect to last for as long as you own it. The only downfalls of this car seem to be difficult wiring if upgrading the stereo, and the engine lacks the capability to enhance (such as superchargers). Overall, for the price this car goes for, it is very well worth looking into. <br><br>
