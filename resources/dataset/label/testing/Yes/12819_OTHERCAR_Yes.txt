            Perhaps this review should be more about leasing a vehicle versus purchasing one.  However, I leased my Nissan Altima GXE, so here goes:

I loved my car.  At the time that I bought it (1997), it had everything that I wanted: 4 door (I still had a child in a car-seat), automatic transmission, power windows, locks and anti-lock breaking, AM/FM Stereo with Cassette Player, air conditioning and an awesome sized trunk.  The only trouble I have experienced with this vehicle is rear window noise (they never sound like they are completely closed!)

Now, as I near the end of my lease, I find I have two options: turn it in and walk away; turn it in and lease another Nissan; or trade it in at a $3000 to $4000 loss.  After traveling to car lot to car lot, nobody will give me the actual value of the car.  They will, very kindly, add $3 to $4K to the price of whatever vehicle I choose.  Therefore, at the end of my lease, I will &quot;walk away&quot; and buy a car somewhere else.

As far as the car itself goes, the gas mileage is not great (my husband's Mustang gets better mileage), and it has somewhat of a rattle when driving.  But overall, it is a great car, reasonably priced, and has never given me a moments worry.  I have heard horror stories of people who buy new cars and they are in the &quot;shop&quot; over and over again.  That is not the case with this car.  I would recommend you buy it; just don't lease it!<br><br>
