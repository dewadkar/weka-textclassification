            Before I bought this mini-van, I checked out what the consumer magazines were saying. I also checked out the crash data. Both indicated a strong &quot;thumbs up&quot; on this van. I really like the way it rides. My wife finds herself falling asleep on long rides, because the van just sings along the highway. 
  I have had my Sienna for about a year and half. Except for routine service, it has stayed out of the shop. We really like the electric side door, that opens with the push of a button inside the van, or on the key fob. When we go to dinner or the mall, the kids love to hit the button, and watch the automatic door open. I am concerned this could become a service item in a few years. 
 While this van has a car-like ride, it doesn't stop on a dime. Keep that in mind in bumper-to-bumper traffic. My list of cons is small: The plastic on the dash board near the speedometer is cheap-looking. The storage capacity is smaller than other vans. The radio, CD player does not give the best sound. The van is great for families who need typical Toyota quality, and cannot afford to have their family vehicle in the shop. I am a fan of the Sienna.<br><br>
