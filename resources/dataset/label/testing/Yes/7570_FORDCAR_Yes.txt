            We have a 98 XLT 4.6L with the leather/towing package/cold weather package/third seat/dual A/C.  The vehicle makes me feel like I'm in an M1 Abrahms Tank. I bought the vehicle solely for that reason.  We have a child that I wanted to keep safe. Rest assured, we drive responsible, not like the &quot;hockey pucks&quot; that give suv-owners a bad name.

First the positives. The towing package makes it capable of pulling a house.  I have pulled a trailer of 7000lbs of crushed stone. No problem!  The brakes are the leak wink in the chain, yet managed to hold on.  The extra cooling kit and the air load leveler makes you think you can pull a 747.  In fact we went to Home Depot and picked up (30) 80lb bags of concrete.  They were behind the second seat.  The air leveler kept the truck level as usual.  Try that with any other vehicle.  The dual-air is nice for keeping separate comfort zones, especially if you have a spouse and child who are cold-natured.  The third seat is used more than we imagined.  Which is sometimes a problem, because everyone wants us to drive all the time, thus racking up the miles and gasoline expenses.  We have 60K miles and only 1 mechanical problem so far.

Which leads to the negatives.  The problem was a clamp on a coolant hose.  On vacation in Canada, it leaked onto the distributor and sparkplugs.  Ford warranty covered the $2.00 part, but I had to pay $212 for the damaged electrical parts and labor.  Not to mention it took them three separate days to get all the skipping problems out.  Consumer Reports rates the '98 as having electrical problems, hopefully my has 'sowed its oats'.  The other complaint was the vehicle has a shimmy-shake at 65mph that no one can figure out.  New tires, balancing, etc.. STILL SHAKES.  Going from an Acura to an SUV, I guess requires some concessions.  The other complaint is cosmetics.  A three seat/8-seater vehicle and no cup holder in the back seat.  A pain when you have a child with a Happy Meal.  The leather drivers seat shows abnormal and excessive wear from getting up and down in this behemoth.

Would I buy another yes, however I would hold out for an Eddie Bauer for the few extra features (Trip Computer/Electronic Climate Control/Sunroof).  My job has provided me with a Ford for the past 15 years, and overall they are reliable vehicles.  However, they should intern with Acura/Honda to learn what FAIR customer service is about.  My neighbor took my advice and bought a 2000 Eddie Bauer and is happy. Try one and see if you don't agree.     <br><br>
