            For the past 4 years I was the owner of a Volvo 850 GLT.  It was a very reliable and competent car, but I was looking to upgrade to a more luxurious vehicle.  After test-driving a Mercedes E-class, a BMW 5 series and a Chrysler 300M, I decided to test the new Volvo S80.  Wow, what a surprise.  This car had the quietness and comfort of the Mercedes, the styling and road worthiness of the BMW, but at a price only several thousand dollars more than the Chrysler.  It also has more than the fair share of creature features and luxury that you'd expect in a $35,000 automobile.

After owning this car for nearly a year, I can honestly say it is a joy to drive whenever I get in it...either for a drive to the store or a jaunt of several hundred miles.  Fuel mileage has been impressive at an average of over 24 mpg., and on regular unleaded fuel.  In the nearly 16,000 miles I have driven, I have no unscheduled maintenance.  Oh yes, another plus is the superb service I get from my Volvo dealer, including a complementary loaner car - new Volvo - whenever I leave it for service.

I expect excellent long-term reliability as I had in my previous Volvo.  I would recommend this car to anyone who thinks that they have to pay $10,000 more for a Benz or a Beemer. <br><br>
