            This vehicle is just what the title implies.  It's a flip of the coin as far as the vehicles reliability.  I myself have 160,000 good miles on the one that I currently own and I must state that for an eye catching, fun to be in the summer, flip down the top and enjoy yourself car, it is just the order.  This non-turbo convertible has proven reliable in getting me to and from. Good on gas mileage also.  The fold down soft top is very easy to fold down into vehicle. Now the other side of the coin, there is a problem with leakage from the roof, the power window module, the power mirror control, as well as the pop up headlights (which cost $700 to have the motor replaced, which is a bit high).  I would definitely advise a manual transmission as I have in mine over the automatic which I have been told by other owners is not as reliable.
