               I found out about the SCION XB when I saw one rolling down the street and was wondering what it was.  

<b>INTRODUCING THE SCION MODEL XB - NEW FOR 2004</b>  

 The SCION XB was first released here in California as a test market around July 2003.   Essentially it is a mini-truck - mini van type vehicle.  Very boxy looking.  The SCION car line comes in two styles called XA and XB. A third style is supposedly coming later.  

   The SCION company is it's own independent corporation, though created, developed, and manufactured by the Toyota Corporation.  Toyota created this alternative division for sales specifically to Generation Y.  The SCION policy for sales is (NO HASSLE/NO HAGGLE) prices.  So when you come to a SCION dealership, you will receive a set price on the vehicle that can not be haggled down.   

   Because these vehicles are targeted at Generation Y people they are customizable with all kinds of goodies, including neon lights, high performance parts, various audio options, etc.    

   The vehicles are being sold for $12,000 for the XA and around $14,000 for the XB (Approximate Invoice prices).

  SCIONs are priced low because the dealers expect to recover the cost through the sales of custom option items that were developed by various vendors for the SCION.  This strategy is similar to what the Apple corporation uses for it's OS-X series of I-MAC and G series computers.

   SCION vehicles have Toyota warranties and similar build quality.

   Currently, the primary source of advertising is through the Internet, a strategy to reach Generation Y people where they spend a lot of time.


<b>My Review of a SCION XB - 5 speed manual transmission - 4 Cylinder - 108 Horse Power engine.</b>

   For my review purposes, I test drove three Generation Y cars in a row so I had something to base my impressions on.   

My first test drive was the <b>SCION XB</b>.  My Second test drive was a <b>Toyota Matrix</b> 6 Speed Manual Transmission.  My third test drive was the <b>Chrysler PT Cruiser</b> 5 Speed Manual Transmission base model.  



<b>CLUTCH, GAS PEDAL, STICK SHIFTER</b>

   The clutch and gas pedal seemed cheap and is made of a very lightweight feeling metal.  Because of the cheap feeling clutch and gas pedals, and a lack of pressure and tension in the clutch, I was concerned that potential problems with the clutch may occur after a few years of ownership.  

   The stick shift was kind'a short and that made it a little difficult to shift, but overall the gears were easy to find.  The dealer I drove with said that a longer stick shift is available as an option.  (An option I will recommend)


<b>THE SEATS</b>

   The seats seem like they are made out of memory foam type material similar to those "AS SEEN ON TV" 
pillows.  They have a very unusual rubbery foam feeling and unlike other car seats, you can push your hand into the seat or squeeze them very easily.  Sort of weird, but cool!

   Sport bucket seats are in the front for the driver and passenger, with thick sides, and are quite comfortable for a first time drive.  

 The seating position and view is excellent in both front and back seats with tons of leg room, especially in the back seats which are slightly elevated higher than the front seats.  The vehicle will comfortably seat 5 people, and 8 rabbits, or 3 small dogs, or 5 chickens, though most drivers will only have 5 people.


   When I tested the back seats for comfort I pushed the front seat all the way back and to my surprise there was still a ton of leg space.   I am 5'11, with long legs and size 13-1/2" shoe size.   Basketball players will like this car!

   Like the Honda Element and the PT Cruiser, the SCION seats can fold flat to create a sort of bed thingy.  You could sleep in it if your parents kick you out!  Doesn't that sound like fun!

   Fold down the back seats and you end up with a mini cargo vehicle for your stuff.   



<b>THE BODY (Inside, Outside, Upside Down)</b>


<b>OUTSIDE</b>

   The body inside and out seemed like it might be durable and feels strong for a vehicle costing a little over $14,000.00. 

   The body is cool looking and will certainly turn heads.   Older people will probably be turned off by it's looks since it is rather boxy looking.  However, that was one of the things that first attracted me to the SCION XB, I was looking from something different.  In many ways I think it is better looking than the Honda Element.

   The XB version comes in about 5 or 6 different colors.  Stone White which I had trouble finding, a deep burgundy/red color which I personally like, black, silver, and gold sort of tan color.  (Check the SCION website to get a real look at the colors, you will be impressed!  The Scion website is a little difficult to find, so just go to Toyota's website and look for the little SCION link at the bottom of the page.)


<b>INSIDE</b>

   Lots and lots and lots of head room for tall people or people with giant heads.

   The interior is very nice and for the most part seems designed with decent quality though some of the interior body parts are hard plastic.  

   The ceiling material looked and felt like it should stay up there for at least 10 years or so.  (It's similar to what I have in my Dodge Ram Truck and that is how long it took before the ceiling cloth fell on my head)

   Let me tell you, this is a must see vehicle, and in my opinion a beautiful vehicle.  I personally found it more appealing that the Honda Element $18,000 or the PT Cruiser $17,000.   The XB is simply a cool looking car, truck, ummm, box thingy with wheels.  The SCION XA which is SCION's other car design can not compare in looks, space, leg room, or value, and the XA looks like a big fat bullet with wheels.  I don't think they are going to sell very many XA's in California.


Comes with Air Conditioning and front air bags standard.

<b>ON THE ROAD</b>

   The stick shift was a little short, shifting was o.k, but this little truck jammed when I stepped on the gas in first gear. It also drove nice in 3rd gear at about 40 miles an hour and never stalled out once. Lots of pepper in the acceleration for a 108 hp vehicle.  However, this was a test model and not for sale, so it most likely had the optional exhaust cooler or what ever it's called that's supposed to kick up it's speed. 

   As I mentioned, I also tested out a Toyota Matrix and a PT Cruiser back to back against the SCION.   

The SCION XB had the least amount of engine noise.  

The Matrix was very noisy in all driving settings.   

The PT Cruiser had a really sucky first gear and stalled out on me four times.  Three times while turning a corner, and once while in traffic while returning to the dealer lot.  The sales person at Chrysler blamed me for the stalls, however I have been driving stick shift vehicles for 19 years and none of the other vehicles I have test driven have had this problem.  The problem was in the PT Cruisers clutch for first gear which did not engage the engine at the same height as the other gears, and then instead of easing into engagement jumped in high and stalled out.  Also, while driving the PT Cruiser I kept bumping elbows with the passenger and my toes kept hitting something whenever I took my foot off of the PT Cruisers clutch.  (I wear a 13-1/2 inch shoe size, remember?)

   I was very impressed overall with how much better the SCION  shifted and accelerated when compared to the more expensive Toyota Matrix and Chrysler PT Cruiser.



<b>STEERING</b>

   The SCION steered nicely until we took it over some minor rough road and then the steering didn't compensate on it's own.   I found that I had to drive firmly with two hands in order to maintain total control over the steering wheel while driving over a road that other vehicles would have laughed at.

   The steering seemed to be one of the weakest factors of the car in my opinion. 


<b>NOISE LEVEL</b>

   For such a small car, this was a nice and pretty quiet drive unlike the Toyota Matrix which shifted loud, drove loud, and parked loud.  If my truck sounded like the Matrix, I would be really scared....   The PT Cruiser was relatively quite but the engine made a thumping noise every so often.  I wasn't able to figure out what was causing it during the test drive (maybe a cat crawled into the engine compartment to keep warm?); I was concerned that it might indicate a poor engine build.


<b>FINAL COMMENTS</b> 

   I really enjoyed driving the SCION XB other than the short shifter and the steering problem.   It has a nice feel to it, has excellent pick up at low speeds, decent breaking (no pull in the steering when stopping), and gets great gas mileage in the 30's due to it's 108 hp engine that is also used in the Toyota ECHO. 

   The SCION XB has the lowest price of the three cars I test drove for this review. It has an overall solid feeling to it, and out of the three cars I would place it at the top of the buy list, with the Toyota Matrix and PT Cruiser both coming in equal at second place for different reasons. 

 Note however, that had I tested the Honda Element EX the same day, the SCION would have come in second.  

Throw in yet another car and the Matrix and PT Cruiser would still come in at the bottom of the list, mainly because of the Matrix's engine noise and lousy shifting, and the PT's lack of cabin space between the Driver and Passenger, it's low foot space above the clutch, and it's horrible first gear.


<b>Personal Notes</b>

This month I will buy either the Honda Element or a SCION XB.  My main debate is price v.s. overall ride quality.  The Honda Element is top class and cost.   The SCION XB has some minor flaws, looks better, and the final purchase cost is about $5,000 less.
