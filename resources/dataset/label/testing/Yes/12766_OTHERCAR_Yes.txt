            A Six with a Stick...as I would refer to it, facetiously
downplaying the hell-bent with leather personality of the
1993 Dodge Stealth R/T Turbo I purchased in March of 1997.
It has reaffirmed the reasons I bought my first Stealth,
and given me a few more; as well as convinced me that good
old American steel is just that much better when Japanese 
engineering meets American design and concept.

The first Stealth I owned, a beautiful Electric Blue
1992 Stealth R/T, gave me 18 to 22 mpg. Amazingly, the
modified (we'll get into that later) 1993 Stealth R/T Turbo
I currently own, delivers 20 to 27 mpg; granted, my
commute to work is now primarily highway miles. For
a vehicle with 222hp, as the '92 Stealth R/T comes with
from the factory, this is acceptable, but not extraordinary.
The cars are quite heavy, and although this contributes
to exquisite road manners, the cost of transporting steel
(and fiberglass, and plastic, and leather, and glass, and
sundry essential accessories), is measured by the ticking
of the gas pump. I was very pleasantly surprised at the 
relative fuel efficiency of the Turbo model. There's 
just something about a car that turns consistent low 
13 second quarter miles, without reaching the 7000rpm 
redline, then drive home, blasting ice-cold a/c, 
getting 25mpg on the way, that I just had to have.
 
The DOHC Stealth ES model, and the Stealth R/T feature a
politely rumbly 222hp DOHC motor; civilized and manageable
enough for anyone. The SOHC motor in the base model, developing
164hp, is adequate for those with a taste for &quot;sporty&quot;
cars, rather than true &quot;sports&quot; cars.

I have never driven a Stealth with an automatic transmission;
so I cannot comment on that; and have actually only seen one
Stealth R/T with this option, although it is very common in 
the Base and ES models. The Stealth R/T Turbo was never 
available with an automatic. If anyone ever tells you that
their Stealth Turbo has an automatic, either they're trying
to pass off their R/T model as a Turbo, or they designed,
engineered, and manufactured it personally. In which case,
said genius has a long and lucrative career in front of 
him/her; remanufacturing the notoriously mediocre transaxle
of these cars. 

The 300hp of the 1991 through 1993 R/T Turbo models used up
the standard five speed Getrag transmissions at a disconcerting
rate, as did the 320hp 1994 through 1996 models, with their
5-speed and optional 6-speed transmissions. And trade monopolies
have restricted the availability of replacement synchros, 
splines, and other repair necessities. The problem first 
surfaced in the '91 model; an upgrade beefed up the transmission
 on the Turbo model for '92; but unfortunately it remains the 
car's only true weakness. Only the torquehappy R/T Turbo suffered
from this; the non-turbo models were not affected. Be sure to
inquire about the status of the transaxle when researching a
possible purchase of a turbo model.

Many were replaced with a factory-strengthened unit under 
warrantee originally, and unless you'll be doing some serious
racing (not that any of us would do such a thing to our precious
Stealth!), it should be alright. My 1993 Stealth R/T Turbo is
now pushing 70,000 miles; I bought it with 26,000 miles, and
no troubles have surfaced. 

The R/T version has a smooth-as-butter shift, and a comfortable
clutch feel; truly a sophisticated and capable car. Front wheel
drive gives a competent performance on all but the iciest roads.
The all-wheel-drive feels steady and sure, allowing the car to
find traction in the worst weather conditions. I've been driving
it almost 50 miles to and from work every day, during the recent
heavy snow conditions that kept many lesser cars off the roads
entirely. Other than a low ground clearance, it negotiates snowy
roads with aplomb. 

Switch to the R/T Turbo version, however; and all the luxuries
and creature comforts in a well-designed, driver-oriented car
are but icing on the cake. The cockpit is logically oriented,
the gauges are easy to read on the fly; and the seats cradle
the driver in an immersive experience designed to focus upon
the joys of the open road. The shifter in the turbo version 
has a noticeably shorter throw; and has a more decisive, 
choppier, no-nonsense feel. The 1991 through 1994 Turbo version 
has not only all-wheel-drive, but all-wheel dual phase steering
as well. In the last couple years of production, through 1996,
all-wheel-steering, and then all-wheel-drive were discontinued.

What a shame, as this really set this car apart from the pack. 
Its sibling, the Mitsubishi 3000GT, continued production through
the 2000 model year; but it too has seen its high-tech gadgets
stripped from the lineup; as the manufacturer prepared to remove
it from production.

Owners frequently modify these cars with air filter system
upgrades, free-flowing exhausts and catbacks, electronic boost
controllers, turbo timers, and lightweight wheels. These modifications
result in improved performance as well as fuel efficiency. You'll
probably want to install an aftermarket turbo boost gauge, 
as well to give you a more exact reading. 

Bottom line, buy a nonturbo Stealth for a reliable, sporty, fun
car designed to cater to the serious driver as well as the 
around town cruiser. Enjoy the handling and the sleek profile of
a modern classic, but climbing in and out of the lowslung seats
can be difficult for those with personal mobility issues. And
the backseat is out of the question for all but double amputees,
grocery bags, and child safety seats. The back seats do fold down
to provide an impressive cargo hold; a mountain bike or a set of
skis fits nicely. I carried home an antique Lane cedar chest,
complete with Queen Anne legs, in my Stealth; on another occaision,
a large air conditioning unit. At that point, I knew it was time
to buy a Dodge Durango (see my review of the Durango!), and use
the Stealth for what it's good at...getting there quickly, safely,
and in style.

For those willing to make the extra commitment to the additional
maintenance schedule of the R/T Turbo model, and are aware of some
of the idiosyncracies of living with a high performance sportscar,
you'll never be sorry you bought the Stealth. It's fun, it's fast, 
and the all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering of the earlier models 
gives it superior handling, as well as safety in poor weather 
conditions. The low growl of the engine, the whine of 
twin turbochargers, and the blazing quick acceleration are the
hallmarks of a muscle car; but the extraordinary handling and
competent ABS brakes give it the true sportscar signature. After
driving the Stealth for a few weeks, you'll find yourself easily
picking out the &quot;pretenders&quot; out there.
