  I got his car because it was a really great deal from my family. My dad wanted a new car, but still owed a couple thousand on the tracker. So, I got he car for about $3000. Needless to say that it was a great deal. Over the years I have come to love my little red wagon. It is very reliable, cheap on gas, and comfy.
  I have driven this tracker to San Fran, Santa Fe, Austin, and many more places. I have never had any problems with it. Well, actually, my dad used to sit for an hour of two in the park with the car on and a/c running, which caused the a/c bearing to break. But, where I live you never need an a/c (or a heater for that matter) so I haven't fixed it.

I get great gas milage with the tracker too. With gas at $2 a gallon it's nice to be able to fill up my tank with less than $20 (tank hold ~9 gallons).
  I have alot of fun in the wagon, it bounces around alot, but you get used to it and can use it to your advantage. Furthermore, the car is so small, that I can cut in and out of traffic with nearly the same ease as a motercycle.
 So, as long as you not afraid to drive fast and bounce around this is a great vehicle.<br><br>
