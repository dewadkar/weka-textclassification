            I drive a  1994 Mitsubishi Diamante and I can truly say that it is the first car that I have ever been excited about!  We bought it used in February of 1998.

 The car has all the options you could ask for and the handling of the road is fabulous.  I'll admit, my husband picked it out for me because he liked it himself.  He knows cars and what they need to perform.  This car has it all. 
 
The road handling ability is what really impressed him.  I loved the moon roof and the sound system!  What can I say, everyone drives a car for their own reasons.  I wanted dependability, comfort and a little class and I got it all! 

The one thing that I will complain about is the fact that the car uses high test gasoline.  Some people will tell you that is not necessary these days, but my husband does not agree.  A part of me wants to gas up with regular and say he'll never know the difference, but the thing is, he would!  The engine in this car is high performance and it does deserve the additional cost of the gasoline.
I am not looking to trade in at this time, but I do know that I will be looking at a newer Diamante in the future.<br><br>
