            I have been using my 6800 for about 5 weeks and I have been taking full advantage of each feature to test the waters.  This camera takes very good quality pictures with great resolution.  I have recorded pictures with the resolution of 2832 x 2128.  And it is so easy-to-use.  You don�t need to play with different buttons to get a good print.  My favorite function is when I put the camera in the cradle.  My pictures automatically download onto my desktop computer which makes it much more efficient for my peers to critique my work.  At the same time my lithium battery is being recharged. The most practical option is the audio recording.  Immediately after I take a shot, I can record my notes unto the camera.  With the finepix viewer software, I can easily download my image and edit them.  In the editing process, I can refer to my voice recorder in order to get the perfect shot. 

Another unique feature is the webcam.  When the camera is in its cradle and connected to the USB port, the camera can serve as a webcam.  I can easily see and speak with friends online. It�s a pretty nice deal.

My camera cost me about $850 dollars with insurance.  It was a little expensive, but I also chose to purchase the insurance.  This camera has eased my entire photographic experience.
