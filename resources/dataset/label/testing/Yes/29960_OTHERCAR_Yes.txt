            Being a new driver, not only am I critical about how fast a car will react to my not always quick enough impulses, but I'm also very worried about what people will say if they see me in it! :) My folks got the van because they realized how difficult our suburban was for me to handle and I can tell you, it has made ALL the difference. The Dodge Grand Caravan has great handling and an amazing ride. It handles well on basically every road you put it through and is the perfect family car. The Dodge Grand Caravan has great saftey features and room for EVERYTHING: the dog, the kids, the skis, even your teenager's luggage!  I highly recommend this van for all of it's great features and would suggest it to both families and singles!<br><br>
