             We have had our 1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue for about 3 months now. We are leasing it for 3 years. When we set out to look for a new vehicle we were very unsure on what we wanted. What we did know is that I was about four months pregnant with our first child and we wanted something safe for our growing family. Safety was our number one concern and comfort was our second.

 We originally set out in hopes of getting a new Blazer. I liked the Blazer a lot but was also interested in the Oldsmobile Alero. At the time they were running a special on the Alero. It was a cute sporty car. So I took 2 of them for a test drive and came back to the dealership feeling even more unsure of what vehicle I wanted. The salesman directed me to the Oldsmobile Intrigue, which at the time I had never even heard of. I took one look at that car and fell in love. 

 It had everything we could have asked for in a car. The suspension was one of the things that I really likes about the car. The suspension is the same as that of the Oldsmobile Aurora, which I had driven several times before. The Aurora was a wonderfully driving car about the same size as the Intrigue but too pricey for my budget. With the baby on the way I was really impressed with the amount of room the intrigue has. the back seat was plenty roomy to get the baby and carseat in and out of and still fit 2 people in comfortably. But what I liked even better was the amount of trunk space that the car has. We could take everything we need for the baby and ourselves and take a trip to visit our family in Florida comfortably. Since it is just the two of us right now though the fold down seats make it even easier to transport large items from one place to another. It sure made Christmas shopping a lot easier too. I would recommend this car to anyone. It has get up and go. The steering is wonderful. 

 I would have to say that it is probably the best deal for the money. I know that when my lease is up I will either buy a new one or keep the one I have now. <br><br>
