            After test driving several other SUV's I once again am returning to the Chevy Suburban, and this makes #3....It's capabilities on or off road out perform all others in it's class, wether picking up groceries or hunting ghost towns in the west my chevy has not failed...I can truly support this vehicle considering I drive an average of 47,000 miles a year..the latest a 1997 LT Model 4x4 as of 1/26/00 has 121,007 miles a combination of highway and high altitude off road driving..Comfort throughout wether it be the driver or the 7th passenger in the third seat back,towing doesn't slow it down either the Vortex engine has continuously out performed my husbands (dodge ram 4x4) this makes for interesting winter tow stories..I would though remind buyers that this is a top of the class vehicle and as such repairs aren't cheap, and would recommend they be done by a professional you won't get by with a five dollar rotor button here....But for my money Suburban is the SUV of choice....I look forward to test driving the NEW Avalanche, or maybe pre ordering in a dark lemon yellow with grey interior???<br><br>
