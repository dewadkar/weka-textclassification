            If you make your living from a van type vehicle take it from this ford 150 econ vehicle. Mine just turned 250k miles with out ANY major repair's
The close's it came was i was having trans problems, it keep shifting to a
lower gear.I was ready to put in a new jasper transmission in when i went to an other trans shop to double check and make sure a new trans was what i needed. To make a longer story short thay wanted to repair the one in the van.When thay hooked up the tester thay disconnected the positive side on the battery, little did thay know thay actualy fix the problem. The deal is on these electronic transmission's thay call it burping., any time your trans start's acting up,just remove the positive side (RED) off the battery leave it off for a few hours this allows the electronic's to reset and it will fix any elect problems you might have.
My van has never let me down from not running, you see i make my living by delivering freight all over the country. In other words i don't make any money unless the wheels are rolling.
Oil changes every 3/5k miles that's the other main fix in not having any problems.
So as you can see BUY a ford econ van 150,250,350 thay make a 450 which is used in the camper family ,do to the freight weight, i'm going to try and get one made for me. Try it you'll like it.today 7/6/00 drove from indpl's in to evansville in r/t got 21 mpg. have 257k now. i can't belive this van it just keeps on keeping on.<br><br>
