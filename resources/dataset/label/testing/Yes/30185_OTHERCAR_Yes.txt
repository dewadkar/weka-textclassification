            In my recent search for my next car, the Cadillac Fleetwood topped the list because, 1)It was all I wanted in a car & 2)It was for a long time my "dream car"!  At a time when most luxury cars are produced according to "european" standards, luxury cars made the american way,(True full size, Big strong V8 engines, & Rear wheel drive), are just about non-existant. The 1995 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham is a statement of what American luxury is all about, & what most luxury cars today do not offer. The Fleetwood offers up vintage luxury with features such as; A full padded vinyl top, Excessive chrome, Stand-up hood ornament, Lamp monitors, Large trunk & Spacious interior, all of which can not be found on ANY car on the market today. Along with the above mentioned features you get what you would expect from a Cadillac; all the "toys" to pamper you like a king. From the power windows to the power memory seats to the electronic climate control & smooth as silk speed sensitive steering, you know right away the main focus is to surround you in pure comfort. You also get a standard feature that you can't get in any other car; CADILLAC STYLE!! I plan to keep this car well beyond it is considered a classic, but in my opinion, it's a classic already! Just drive one & you'll know what I mean.
