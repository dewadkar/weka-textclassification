            I work in a digital imaging department and my colleagues and I could not wait for this camera to arrive.  When it did, we were more than pleasantly surprised at all of the features.  

Overall, the design was quite nice.  Not as bulky as the Coolpix 5000 or Olympus 5050, but not so small as an Elph or Coolpix 3100.  I found the overall camera size to be quite nice.  The button placement was fairly easy to memorize in quick order, though, the navigation buttons could have been a little bit bigger.

The options in the camera were quite nice, save for the digital zoom.  For some reason, it does not work past 3 megapixels and for me, that was a purchasing negative.  Why would I want to buy a 5MP camera with a great digital zoom if I could only use it up to 3MP?  That aside, I found the hologram AE function to be superb in taking night shots.  I found my subjects came in clearer using this option.  The voice tags are just a great idea.  It's nice to take a picture of something on vacation, say what it is when you snap the picture, and have that message given to you when you review the picture.

The Hot Shoe for an external flash is a god send.  Red Eye is basically a thing of the past with an external flash.  The pop up flash does a nice job as well, however red eye is still fairly prevelant under certain conditions.  I like the addition of "pre set" shooting modes, however I was disappointed at the limited amount of them.  The 3100 has over 14, why couldn't Sony slip in a few more for the intermediate or "lazy" camera user?

The battery life is, well, horrid to say the least.  I can get roughly 75-100 pictures on a battery if I don't use the review option too much or have the LCD on.  I have 4 batteries for my camera and I would say during the course of a baseball game, for instance, I'll use 2 1/2, which is unacceptable.  The batteries charge extremely fast, roughly in two to three hours, but the life is very limited.

The pictures are incredible, let me say that.  The Carl Zeiss lens and the high quality CCD combine to make an incredible picture that I can happily print out on my Canon 470i and frame without anyone knowing it is a digital picture.  The option of being able to take a 16x20 has already been used by me and the result was absolutely flawless.  Unless one uses a magnifying glass, the pixelization is almost non existent.  

The use of a Memory Stick Pro is nice, however, I have not been able to access the Magic Gate technology and according to the manual, I can't.  Is this an issue that will be resolved or is this something I'll have to live with?

The software was....eh.  But that's basically true with most digital cameras anyway so I won't hold it against Sony.


OVERALL

Overall the camera was a really nice find.  It takes absolutely great pictures, the macro mode is unreal, the shutter speed as fast as 1/1000th of a second is superb for sporting events.  My main disappointments are the limited battery life, small selection of presets, inability to use digital zoom to the max unless in VGA mode and the small size of the navigation buttons.  The plus's are definitely the picture quality, hologram AE function, night vision shooting (useless but fun to play with), night framing mode, voice tags and hot shoe mount.  I'd recommmend this camera to anyone, it's a really nice one.
