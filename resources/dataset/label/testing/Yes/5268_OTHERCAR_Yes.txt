                This is my first true essay, or opinion on trucks. I am writing on a 1993 Toyota 4Runner. My dad recently bought me this car, for me to learn how to drive and to have when I turn 16. It is light green, fully loaded with: 4WD, CD player, Sun-roof, power everything (for that i am very grateful), rear window wiper, roof rack, and a 5 speed transmission, and many more accesories. I just recieved my &quot;new&quot; car this week, and on the first day, i fell in love with it. I went to my dad's house and there i learned to drive a stick shift in an hour and a half. Then i began to practice going up a hill. Right off the bat i couyld feel the power of the V6 engine beneath my feet. Learning to take off, was a kick, because I could stay on the clutch (deliberately) and rev the engine, just to hear the power. I especially love my sunroof, whever i get a car, im gonna make sure it has a sunroof, and a 5-6 speed transmission. 
    The weekend I recieved my truck, I dont think I got any sleep, all I could think about was how much I wanted to drive my truck! As soon a I got up I could'nt wait to go outside and atleast look at the smooth lines of the body, that had only one minor dent in the left fender. Also the good things about having a used car is i dont have to worry about dinging it up a lil, because its used for goodness sake, and all the modifications I want to do to it will not void the warranty! Although the car looks perfectly fine stock, there are still a few mods i want to do like, wider fenderflares, which i will get in the nest week or two, a new brush guard, and possibly a paint job, but thas on the hush hush
