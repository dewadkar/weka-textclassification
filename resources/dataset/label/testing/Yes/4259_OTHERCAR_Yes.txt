            The good news:

6 1/2 years old, the car still runs great, looks great and handles great.  The interior held up well and, with age, BMW's seem to season and build Character.  I get good gas mileage (usually ~29mpg) and repairs have been rare.  (Note, I am good about changing Oil and air filter regularly).


The bad news:

The car is small, particularly the trunk which cannot hold my hockey stick without putting down the rear seats.  
The radio looks very nice but has never been very impressive for reception or sound quality (my speakers sometimes crackle out).  
When I lived in Texas I had trouble with the glue that held the leather to the door panels coming unstuck.  The dealership always was cooperative about fixing this problem, but inevitably it would recur in the hot summer months.  
There is no decent cup holder.<br><br>
