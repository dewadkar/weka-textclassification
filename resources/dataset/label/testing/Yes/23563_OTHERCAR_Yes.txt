            I bought my K1500, 4.3 liter 6 cylinder engine, in October of 1998. Since then I've put 48000 Miles on the odometer. 48000 absolutely trouble free miles! Not even one minor complaint. I don't know whether I just had incredible luck or what!

I've added a few items like wind deflectors for the windows, hood deflector, bedliner (Pendaliner, by far the best one), new radio (with CD player), door sill protectors, etc.

I also had a dual remote oil filtering systems from AMSOIL (and synthetic oil) installed because I want to keep this truck for at least 400.000 miles and I know that with this micro-filtering system at least the engine is easily going to last that long. My previous truck (with Amsoil filters) had 340.000 miles on the odometer and was NOT needing any additional oil between changes!

My mileage so far has been great, 21 to 22 mpg. Well, compared to small 4 cylinder Japanese cars it's not so great. But will those small cars give you great protection in case of an accident? Will you be able to see over most vehicles in front of you? Will you have 4 wheel drive when you need it? Obviously not!

The ride is great (ok, a little harsher than most cars), the seats are comfortable and the engine has more than enough pickup. I use this truck to commute 40 miles each way, everyday and 40% is stop and go. It is a pleasure to drive and I arrive at work very relaxed.

Sure, this is no vehicle for families and there's no place to put the groceries. But for my weekends on forest roads and trails it's perfect.

I would recommend this truck to anyone who doesn't need to carry a lot of heavy stuff or people. As personal transportation it's great, most of the time you don't even hear the engine, especially while cruising at 70 mph!
