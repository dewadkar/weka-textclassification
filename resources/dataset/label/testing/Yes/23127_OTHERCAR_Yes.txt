            My husband surprised me in December, 1998 with a "Hello Officer RED" Dodge Stratus ES.  It's an automatic 4 door with "autostick" on the floor.  The autostick took a little getting used to, but now that's all I use.  It's like using a manual transmission, but without a clutch. 

What sold me on this car was when I made a U-turn, it turned so easily--no struggling whatsoever.  Our car had been used as a 'program' car, and later I found out it was a rental car in Florida.  It was loaded--AC; power windows, power brakes, a seat height adjustment feature; adjustable steering wheel; nice cassette stereo system.  


We've driven across country with it twice and it's a very comfortable ride.  The back seat folds down and we stored a twin sized mattress in the car without a problem.

The things that bother me about this car are the seatbelts.  They constantly get twisted and tangled.  Also the buckles that receive the belt are almost buried in the seat.  We ended up getting seat belt extenders put on our car so we wouldn't have to fish around for the receiver part.

Another annoying feature is that when I glance out the side windows to turn, the metal frame is so wide that I have to glance back and forth to see if there are cars.  It's really distracting, thinking that there might be a car you missed seeing because of the frame.  

In spite of these things, I still really like this car.  And in spite of the "Hello Officer red" color, no officer has stopped me!
