            Named after the famous Tourist Trophy race, the Audi TT lives up to it's sporting heritage.  This is a true sports car, not just a SPORTY car, so one should be prepared for the somewhat harsh sports car ride.  In everyday, commute traffic it might be a little too much to take, but get on an open twisty road and you can't help but smile. 

The 1.8L turbo provides more than adequate power, but it's no muscle car. The car is fast and the power comes on smooth with very little turbo lag, still it won't press you back in your seat like the Honda S2000 or Porsche Boxter. Opt for the  5-speed manual transmission, you won't be sorry. Inside, the attention to detail is amazing. Brushed aluminum surfaces blending perfectly with leather and plastic.  Especially notable is the clever radio cover. Under the hood one is hard pressed to find anything that looks like an engine, and yet it is beautiful. Smooth panels and an impressive Audi logo are the only things that hint at the mechanical symphony that awaits the driver.

On the down side things like rear visibility and ease of getting in and out may hamper your enjoyment of the car.  Don't let those back seats fool you, only children could make use of them. Unfortunately the the price is a bit high considering the fact that you will never get more than 2 adults in it at one time.

Much like it's mechanical cousin the New Beetle, the Audi TT will get you noticed.  Passing motorists will wave and point. Expect questions when in a public parking lot.  Certainly this is part of the fun, but for some it can be downright annoying.
