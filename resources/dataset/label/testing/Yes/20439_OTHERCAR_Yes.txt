            Who knew how good life could be??!!! 

I came across this dream of a car when I totaled my 1996 VW Jetta GL in an accident. My '96 Jetta was the car that I thought could never be outdone, I loved it...but low-and-behold, in my sorrow and misery I came across this gem! Of course I had to look at the new Jetta's, but at first glance I didn't like the shape. They looked too rounded and small compared to my old Jetta. But I gave in and took it for a test drive. 

WOW!!!! After driving it for 30 seconds, I knew I was going to buy it. Smooth ride, comfortable...it was perfect for my husband and I. Now I, of course, have a more cosmetic review of this car, rather than evaluating the 2.0 fuel injection system, the ABS, 4-wheel brake system, anti-theft system, etc...all I know is that it's an awesome car. If you want a review on the mechanics of the car, go to &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;!! 

It's low to the ground and has great handling in snow and rain. It's very sporty and quick-you can easily go 80 mph and not even know it (not that I have, of course.) The trunk is incredibly spacious, and there is a GLOVE COMPARTMENT!! Something that was missing on my '96 Jetta! And the dash lights up like Las Vegas at night with purple and red indicator lights everywhere (a major selling point for me! What can I say it was SOOOOO cool!!) If you live in a cooler area, I suggest the COLD WEATHER PACKAGE...the seats heat up and that is an awesome bonus when it's cold outside!! And it has this awesome drink tray!! It seems that Volkswagen tried to think of every possible convienence a car would need and put it into this car!

But, of course there are a few things that I would change...it IS a little small...the backseat has very little leg room if the driver or passenger has long legs...so this is not the family car for 5, with teenagers...but it's perfect for a young family. And the new keys, while very handy with the door/trunk locks and panic button, are rather large...hard to keep on a key ring. But come on, is that really a reason NOT to own this car!!! <br><br>
