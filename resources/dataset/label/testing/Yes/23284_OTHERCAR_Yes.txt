            When my husband's car was on its last "leg," we began shopping around for a used car to replace it. (May 2001)  By chance, the salesman showed us a sporty little white car that just happened to be in our price range ($5000).  We sat down in it and took it for a spin around the block.
It was roomy and sporty with more comfort than I could imagine.  Within two months of buying it, we took it on a road trip from Texas to Illinois.  Wow, that was a comfortable ride.  At that point, we were positive we had made a good buy.
The drawbacks?  We bought it with pretty high mileage for a 1998.  We've had to replace a few things already (brake pads, plugs and wires).  I've learned that parts and labor for this particular vehicle do not come cheap.  We have a crack in the windshield that was "repaired" due to the high cost of replacing the windshield (more than $300).
