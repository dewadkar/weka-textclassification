            My first car. A very important decision considering I wanted to go all out and get a brand new one. I test drove a 4WD and it was great...that was all I needed to know that I absolutely wanted one.
My tribute is pitch black with tinted windows and I tell ya, it's a car that is sexy. That's the only word I can think of when I see it. Being a female, a lot of the SUV's seem really gigantic to me but this seems to be a baby version of that.
The interior is very basic, if you're not going for something too fancy. Because of cost, I didn't go for the leather but I guess that would sizzle it up a bit.  Also because of rising gas prices, this SUV is great on gas, which is also a big reason for purchasing it.
The only one complaint I have is, it's quite a loud car. I guess I'm spoilt driving our other family cars, but you seem to hear the wind more as well as the actual car. It's not a problem if you like loud music though.
If you don't do a lot of 4WDriving, then the 2WD is good, but the 4WD is great when it snows and also for those gravelly roads. We drive up to the mountains a lot so it's perfect for those long drives, just like a car. For people who like to drive fast, this isn't' a good vehicle. There are warnings for higher rollover risks, so if you like taking fast corners, Pleeeze don't buy this. It's good for me cause I need to start slowing down. Other than that...all I can say is test drive one out and see for yourself. It's a great car..sorry...SUV.
