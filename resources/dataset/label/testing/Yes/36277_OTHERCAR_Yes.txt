            I love my Corolla! It's a nice little car that has been very dependable for me. We started leasing this car in December 1997 because my piece of junk Ford Probe was about to die and I needed an inexpensive car to get me to work and back. I have 32,000 miles on my car and haven't needed any repair work yet. I just take it to the dealership every 3,000 miles for maintenance, and it has worked wonderfully. (By the way, they are always so nice when I take it in for maintenance.)
I get really good gas mileage, I only need to fill my tank once every week and a half.
I love driving my car, it handles pretty nicely. It's not a speed demon, but that's not what I'm looking for in a car. It picks up at just the right speed, not too fast, not too slow.
The only problems that I have with my Corolla are that the windows fog up pretty easily, so I have to have it on defrost at all times when it is cold or rainy; the other problem is that the back seat isn't that great for rear-facing infant seats. The seats are too compact,you can get the carseat to fit, but it takes a LOT of work!
I wouldn't recommend it to large people or people who want a really speedy car. I would recommend this car to anyone who just needs a small, dependable car for everyday driving.<br><br>
