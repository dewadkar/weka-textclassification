            the chevy tahoe is a great vehicle to drive. it handles nice, rides like a dream, however it isn't the vehicle for gas economy. my tahoe gets about an ave. 14 miles to the gal. but the big kicker is the resale. when purchasing this vehicle you could be led to believe the resale is good, however if you now look in the blue book for a three to four year window you will see you are going to pay a heavy premium for owning this vehicle and even a heavier premium for leasing the same.  it's a great vehicle but you will pay the piper for driving it!!!!!!<br><br>
