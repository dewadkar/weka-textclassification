            I am in my second LX. The first I drove 267,000 miles and the second I am still driving at 285,000 miles. The most important thing about this vehicle is it's ride. The front seats in this car are every bit as comfortable as the luxury cars. Most of my driving is interstate and the car performs well. I have kept up with regular Honda dealership service when suggested and have had no problems with either car. I am amazed at the workmanship and the way the interior holds up to the normal wear and tear of usage. The only area of concern for both vehicles is the need for more regular wheel alignment than on my other American made vehicles. When they need alignment they chew the tread off the tires rather quickly. I would rate this car as the best I have owned in thirty years. I have owned before the Pontiac Grand Ville, Mercury Cougar, Ford F100 Truck and the LX has far and away out performed in gas mileage, comfort, endurance, and beauty.<br><br>
