            I mainly got this vehicle because I live in upstate New York.  The Expedition is very good in the snow with alternating four wheel drive and regular four wheel drive, theres no slipping in this beast.  I also love the V8 engine which provides a lot of power and good acceleration to spite the big size of this suv.  Driving the Expedition is like flying an airplane, your above everyone else it seems like no accident can harm you.  The Expedition also offers a lot of space for groceries and baggage.  The fold down seats are very convenient for putting extremely long objects like skis or bikes in the back.  The sound system isn't bad but you cant complain about a 6 cd changer.  The one thing I'm not too thrilled about in the Expedition is that the handling sometimes isn't that great.  But what can you expect from a vehicle its size?<br><br>
