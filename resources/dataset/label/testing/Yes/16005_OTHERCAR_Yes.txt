            This is my wife's car which we bought December, 2000. We also looked at an Accord.  We choose the Camry because the transmission shifted smoother, and interior was quieter. Handling seemed somewhat better in the Accord.  Otherwise, the two were interchangeable.

Headroom with the sunroof is lacking.  I am 5'10 and if the seat is upright my head is very close to the ceiling.

We have found though premium fuel is recommended, it gets the same mileage with regular (acceptable per the owners manual) though I am sure the power is somewhat less.  

Mileage in town started at 17mpg. On the highway 23MPG.  In town it has risen to 19mpg. It still runs about 23 on the highway which could be a function of driving somewhat too fast. However, 23 seem really poor on the highway when GM cars with a V6 routinely get 30mpg.

Up to 80 mph the power is very impressive, but then it starts to fade. This may be a function of using regular gas.

We took a 5000 mile trip this summer.  I found the lower back support to be inadequate.  However, the car itself proved to be very reliable and quiet.  While climbing some mountain passes, I smelled something getting hot possibly a hot transmission or ????(I have no idea what it was) ????? which concerned me.  Since there were no other cars around it had to be our car.

Problems:  The pinstripes on the car started peeling off almost immediately, this was dealer installed.  The installer said it was due to being installed in cold weather.  They replaced it in the spring and it is fine now.  I didn't drive the car until the trip above.  I noticed it pulled to the left.  Sure enough, we took it in and it was out of alignment. which was covered by warranty (up to 20000 miles).  A friend of mine had a 97 Camry which he discovered was out of alignment but only after it destroyed his tires in 25000 miles.  I would suggest an alignment check when buying a new car.  At 20,000 miles it appear the tire will be worn out before we reach 25,000 miles.

I would recommend the dealer, Crown of Lawrence, Kansas.  We were referred by an internet site and got the car for $500 over invoice (price listed includes tax).  However, I would be sure to take a calculator.  They had a low finance deal which we took.  Though we specifically said we didn't want it, he attempted to sneak in insurance.  The finance agreement didn't show it, I just happened to think the amount financed looked too high and upon manually adding up found there was an extra $300 which we had removed.

I expect the Camry to be ultra reliable. Except for mileage we have no regrets.
