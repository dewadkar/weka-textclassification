            The original Mustang was introduced in April of 1964, and since then, has been one of the best-selling Ford cars.  Not only that, but the Mustang created a segement known to many as the "pony car."  Competitors, such as the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, have attempted to sway would-be Mustang owners, but since it is no longer being manufactured, the Mustang is once again, America's only ponycar.

In 1991, SVT was started by Ford in an attempt to make high-performance Fords, from within the factory, not unlike BMW's M-series cars, or Mercedes' AMG.  In 1993, when the first SVT Mustang was introduced it started a trend that has continued even a decade later.  New for 2003, is a supercharged Cobra, which in fact is the most powerful Mustang ever from SVT.

<b>INTERIOR</b>: The Mustang is a fairly loud car.  With just under 400 horsepower under the hood, its aggresive exhaust note would frighten any Civic or Eclipse driver, that stands in its way!  After a while, however, the boominess of the exhaust can get tiresome.

The white-face gauges are easy to read, and the controls are simple enough to understand without the use of the owner's manual.  I have a few minor gripes about the interior, though.  For a car that costs nearly $40,000, I would expect an interior with even a little more class than the Mustang's lesser models.  The only interior differences are Cobra badging thoroughout, (as mentioned above) the white-face gauges and two-tone leather upholstery.  Also, the shifter, which is unique to the Cobra (design-wise), was too notchy to actually have fun with.  I didn't expect it to be as smooth as say an Acura 3.2CL Type-S shifter, but I do think Ford could have done a better job as far as shift quality is concerned.  Even with long arms, I had stretch to reach 5th gear.

Up front, the cabin is fairly roomy for such a small sports car.  The Cobra's leather bucket seats are comfortable and at the same time very supportive laterally.  Unfortunately, the doors are quite long and rather heavy.  In fact, one small passenger of mine had difficulty getting out of the car when parked sideways on a hill.

Rear-seat accomodations are far worse, however.  I found it <b>EXTREMELY</b> difficult to get comfortable in the rear.  The back seat is guaranteed to give any daredevil claustrophobia within seconds (that was a joke...).  With my knees digging into the front passenger's seat it didn't take long for me to jump out and back into the drivers seat!

Though I do not see the purpose of sports cars having cargo room (it would hurt if they DID , though), the Mustang's adequate 10.9 cubic feet of cargo space is further extended with the use of split-folding rear seats, a feature the convertible model does not have.

My test Cobra coupe came with many features.  Full power, criuse control, a tilt steering wheel, leather upholstery, and a CD player just to name a few.

<b>ENGINE</b>: This year's SVT Mustang Cobra is powered by a supercharged 4.6-liter V8 engine that puts out 390 forced-induction horsepower at 6,000 rpm, and 390 lb./ft. of torque at 3,500 rpm.  The sole transmission is a notchy 6-speed manual.  This is in fact the most powerful car I have ever driven, and the powerful motor seems to overpower the rear wheels VERY easily.  Off-line acceleration is VERY fast.  When the wheels are firmly planted, the car just seems to leap off-the-line, pressing me into the seat.  Even in higher gears and at low speeds, acceleration is still strong.  On the highway, there is an abundance of passing power and unlike the older Mustang that I tested, it NEVER runs out of breath at high rpm.

Ford requires premium fuel for the Cobra due to the supercharger.  With EPA estimates of 16 city and 22 highway, and a 15.7 gallon fuel tank, expect to be at the gas station often.

<b>HANDLING</b>: With the aid of traction control, I expect wet-weather handling to be better than without.  Also, with a fully independant suspension, the Cobra's tail-end doesn't skip around over bumps like the original live-axle Mustang.  With wide 275/40ZR-17 Goodyear tires, the largest tire ever fitted on a Mustang from the factory, handling tight corners at higher-than-normal speeds is easier, and more fun than I thought.  Besides the Miata, and my Turbo Coupe, the new '03 Mustang Cobra is the most fun-to-drive sports car I have EVER driven.

<b>RIDE</b>: What helps in handling, almost always seems to spoil in ride.  As noted above, the stiff suspension and low-profile tires give the Mustang an overly stiff ride compared to most cars, but that shouldn't bother would-be Cobra buyers.

<b>RELIABILITY</b>: Though some of my family members who used to, or still own Fords have had their fair share of problems, I hope that the Mustang, even for 2003, is as reliable as most new cars are.

<b>VALUE</b>: America's ponycar has out-lived the Camaro/Firebird and still attracts hundreds of thousands of customers annually.  This is due to their rather wide market.  For every Mustang their is a specific model for a specific person.  V6 models attract with their value and style.  

GT models are appealing to those who want a little more "go" but don't want to spend $30,000 or more.  Mach 1 buyers are willing to pay for extra insurance, and price, but in return get a nostalgic sports car that stands out from the crowd of Japanese sport compacts.  The Cobra offers Corvette-like performance for nearly thousands of dollars less.
