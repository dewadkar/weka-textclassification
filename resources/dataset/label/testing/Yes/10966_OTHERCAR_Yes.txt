            I bought a Buick regal, 4 door sedan in 1993.  At that time my job required constant travel and I wanted an automobile that would be comfortable as well as get good gas mileage.  The Buick Regal does it all!! It consistently gets 30-32 miles per gallon when traveling the interstate highways, but gets a little less than that when driving in city stop-start traffic.
When traveling long trips, sometimes 6 hours or more, I have never had leg cramps or a backache while driving this car. Backaches and leg cramps have been real problems for me when driving (or riding in)other vehicles of approximately the same size. The gauges are well placed and easy to read. The options that I chose allows me to change radio stations on the steering wheel which is good since I am small and do not like to take my hands off the steering wheel to reach for radio controls while driving. The doors lock automatically as soon as the car starts to move.  This is important in this day and age of &quot;car jacking&quot; especially if you have to drive in a city as I do. There is a little bell that rings if you should forget to click off your turn signals! This automobile has 65,000 miles on it and has never needed more than routine maintenance.The next car I buy will certainly be a Buick! <br><br>
