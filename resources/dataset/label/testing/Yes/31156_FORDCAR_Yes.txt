I am on my third car, and haven't been really happy with a car purchase until now.  Recently I purchased a 1998 Ford Mustang GT Coupe.  It came fully loaded, with premium sound package, leather, ABS, keyless entry, power everything.  I opted for a manual transmission for obvious reasons.  The car is an absolute joy to drive.  The manual transmission and GT engine make it really smoke, and the performance tires grip and hug the road.  The car really gets noticed, but its kinda flashy and might attract the wrong kind of attention.  

The leather interior is beautiful, but the conditions are kind of cramped.  There isn't much legroom for tall guys like me, and the backseat is only there for the insurance discount.  

The audio quality from the stereo is excellent, and having CD and cassette is really convenient.  There are 6 speakers overall, and the two rear speakers are each driven by their own amplifier.  

By buying a late-model used car, I saved a whopping 30% for a car that only had 26,000 miles on it, and was in excellent condition.  Kelly's blue book listed the car's value at $19,500, while I paid only $17,999.  The only drawback was losing a large chunk of the warranty.  Honestly though, the savings are worth it, and I rarely used the warranty on my previous vehicles.  

Yes, they are flashy, but Mustangs in general offer a lot of bang for their buck.  Especially when you compare to foreign models like Hondas, Mitsubishi Eclipses, Toyota Celicas.  These cars typically are priced higher with inferior options and smaller engines.  Why buy a 2000 Eclipse with optional V6 engine for $24,000, when you can have a 2000 Mustang GT with a high output V8 for the same price.  <br><br>
