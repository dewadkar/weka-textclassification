            I purchased my Fuji FinePix 2400Zoom camera for the holidays.  The list price on this was $399.99 which included the USB Interface and 8MB SmartMedia.  We purchased this through Gateway and the price was $354, so we added a 16MB SmartMedia Card as well bringing the total price to under the list.  They also had a promo of free shipping and no sales tax which sweetened the deal.

We were looking for a camera in the "mid range" category between $200 and $500, since this was our first.  We had settled in on the Fuji MX1400 when we came across this one.  After comparing, we decided that this would be a good starting camera for us.

We received the camera in two days and immediately began setting it up and taking pictures.  We set the camera on the lowest setting and started taking pictures.  We ran back to the computer like kids getting candy.... and downloaded them.  Were we surprised!  The quality of the pictures were terrific!  We were able to crop them with ease, making them even better.  We then tried the largest setting (1600x1200) in the Fine mode.  We went out to our property with our two dogs and started taking pictures.  Upon returning to the house, we downloaded the pictures and nearly fell off our chairs.  Every blade of grass was distinguished from the next.  The pictures were beyond our dreams for clarity.  Most of the digital pictures we have seen have been fuzzy and dark or the clear ones came from the most expensive cameras.  The pictures are easily erased once you have saved them to your hard drive or other media.

Each day we read a little more and test out a few more things.  

One of the drawbacks is that you run through batteries very quickly.  I would recommend purchasing the battery charger and rechargeable batteries (2 sets) which we will do shortly.  I would also recommend purchasing the largest SmartMedia card you can afford.  For most purposes, the lowest setting (640x480) is more than sufficient and the yield of pictures in that setting is up to 89 pictures on the 8MB card.  If you switch to the 1600x1200 setting, and the fine mode, your yield is 10 pictures.  These make wonderful photos and you can copy 8x10's with professional quality.

The more we experiment, the more we love this camera.  I would put this high on the list if you are looking for a medium priced digital camera.
