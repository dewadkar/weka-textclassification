            I have been driving Nissans, four different ones, since 1982.  These cars are by far the most reliable kinds of cars you can find for your money. I drove one for nearly 300,00 miles! They almost never break down, run well and get great gas mileage.  I would definitely recommend a Nissan to anyone who is looking for reliable transportation at a very low and affordable cost! The only drawback for Nissans is that they are not suitable for large families (too small) unless you choose a Nissan van such as the Nissan Quest.<br><br>
