            I always liked the good things I've heard about Toyota even though we've been a Volvo family for many years.

The decision to switch brands came after we priced and test drove the Volvo S40.  Great pickup, ok style, but VERY expensive even with no options.  And when I say no options, I mean the interior is positively shabby looking with a cheap radio (no CD) and if you want a decent metallic color it's an extra $400!  Also, Volvo dealers don't know how to deal...so off we went to Toyota.

We went to a total of three dealers and settled on the one with the best price, best choice, and cleanest service department.  Oddly enough, one dealer had all three.

We tried the CE, LE and XLE Camry based on options, size and overall impression and settled on the 4-cylinder LE with a few extra options.

We wanted the optional front side airbags (it's a Volvo thing), Value Pack#3 which is the power windows, doors, driver seat, tilt steering wheel and some other stuff, and a LoJack alarm system.

The difference between the V4 and V6 was not enough to make me spend the extra for the V6 but that is an individual opinion. 

I found the car very roomy and the trunk space more than adequate. Also in the trunk are two hooks to keep bags from rolling around.

The Toyota engine layout is superb with excellent spacing between all major components and everything clearly marked.  The fuel tank holds 18.5 gallons which is great for long trips.  

All the internal controls are very well configured, with the possible exception on the cruise control which I frequently confuse with the wipers.

The radio has a great sound and the standard CD player is a pleasure.  The center console is very deep and holds quite a few CD's.

In the center of the ceiling is a compartment for a garage door opener, or it also comes with a holder that fits sun glasses.

There are two cup holders with doors in the center panel.  The cup holder also holds my cell phone in a convenient upright position.  There is also two power plugs in the front, one with a lighter and the other as a spare for recharging your cell phone or plugging in any 12V device.

Visibility is excellent with no pillars in the way and turning radius is superb.

After 1000 miles the car is very quiet..no engine or wind noise and city mileage is about 25 mpg.  The handling is very good but not as good as the road feel from Volvo.  On the other hand the ride is smoother and more comfortable in the Camry.

I have not found a single sign of sloppy workmanship (and boy did I look).  Upholstery well fitted, all controls work perfectly, no funny noises or engine hesitations.

Well, isn't there anything I don't like?  The answer is yes for some very minor things.  First the remote does NOT open the trunk.  There is a lever in the car or you have to use your key.  Second the front arm rest misses the arm....by that I mean it is very short and you can only rest your elbow.  And, so far that's it.  The only other problem is that there are so many other Camrys on the road that looking for your car in a parking lot can be an interesting experience.

The Camry LE nicely loaded and with the options we wanted was still $7000 less than the stripped Volvo S40 so it was a no-brainer which to pick.

We did not get the dealer extended warranty since I think you can get a better deal from AAA.  Also, the LoJack is slightly cheaper through AAA, but I felt better letting the dealer install it because I would rather go back to the dealer if there was any problem.

A final word.  We insisted that the dealer change the 5 tires (yes the spare is a full size tire) to Dunlop since they are rated higher than some of the others that come from the factory.  This was not a problem and is one of those no-cost things that the dealer can do for you to keep you happy.  Also, make sure the salesman writes it down!  It keeps them honest.
