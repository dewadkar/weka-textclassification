            The Saturn SC2 is my dream car.  Why?  This car does it all.  It is sporty-- makes any young person with dreams of a &quot;cool&quot; car drool, easy to maintain, fast, a breeze to drive, roomy, inexpensive as far as coupes go and one of the safest cars on the market!  To top it all off, Saturn cars retain their value longer than any other car that exists today-- talk about trade-in value!

I bought this vehicle when I decided it was time to get rid of the old &quot;hand-me-down&quot; car I had been driving since high school.  In choosing my car, I did extensive research on the internet, in Consumer Reports, and other car magazines.  Everything I read about this car told me that it was a smart buy.  But what was most important to me was safety.  A victim of a horrible car accident a few years ago, I have learned the importance of feeling safe in your car and being able to rely on the structure and safety measures built into your car.  The Saturn Coupe is strong, well-designed, comes standard with dual-side air bags and has some great safety options such as anti-lock breaks and Variable Traction Control which helps reduce and control tire spin-- great for cold, icy northern winters!

The best part about this car is its now-standard third door on the driver's side of the car.  This door make getting things, including passengers, in and out of the vehicle easily and quick.  Between it's large trunk, fold down back seats and third door, I can cart more around in this car than I could in my four-door sedan.

The ride is smooth in this car, though sometimes a little noisy.  The manual transmission is extremely driver-friendly -- a very easy car in which to teach a new driver to drive a manual transmission.  And, boy, does this car have some pick-up, if you are willing to be a little gutsy with the gas pedal!  And have I mentioned the dent-resistant, rust-proof polymer body design??

I would recommend this car to practically everyone.  Even those who have bad backs and could not previously drive a sports car with its back-unfriendly bucket seats will be in for a suprise because of the car's adjustable driver's side lumbar support.  I have seen very large or tall people have problems fitting in comfortably because the driver's seat does not slide back very far, but nothing else noticeable.

So if you are looking for a great, reliable sports car which you do not need to spend a fortune to own, this is it!<br><br>
