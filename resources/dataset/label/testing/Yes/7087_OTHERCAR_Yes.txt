            This is my all time favorite vehicle.
Great gas mileage 32 + miles per gallon!!!!!
I bought this vehicle when it was 5 years old, with 60k miles on it. It is a five speed, four door. This vehicle to this day has never left me stranded.

Since owning the vehicle I have replace the tires and the catalytic converter --      yup!! that's it!!  It now has 111k miles on it, and I wouldn't trade it for a brand new Ford!!

If you read my review on the Ford F250 you will see I deserve a good vehicle.  You will also see that Chevys are much better in my book!!


Recap--
I really don't know what else to say about this vehicle.  I love it. It is trustworthy, great gas mileage, wonderful ride.<br><br>
