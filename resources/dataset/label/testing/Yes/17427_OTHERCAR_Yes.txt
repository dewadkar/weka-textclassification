            When I finally got fed up with getting stuck in the snow during winter, I decided I wanted an SUV.  I can't even begin to tell you how much research I did before I actually decided on the Passport.  I think I went to every consumer website and bought every consumer digest out there just to make sure I was making a sound decision.  There were so many things I wanted on an SUV but I didn't want to spend my entire savings on one. Now that I have owned my passport for over a year, I can honestly what I feel about this vehicle and what positive and negative experiences I have had with it.

There were many things that attracted me to the Passport.  I made the decision that I wanted just about all the gadgets and doodads possible that I could get for under 30,000 dollars.  What I found was the Passport EX.  I knew that I wanted 4-wheel drive and that I didn't want another Ford.  I also knew I wanted a CD player, a moon roof, a rear mounted spare tire, a high wheel ground clearance, and a strong v6 engine.  The passport had all of these things and more.  Everything that came with the passport has been what I expected, but there were also a lot of other things I noticed along the way.  I lug around a lot of audio music equipment and have found that the cargo room is very spacious.  I like that there are 2 additional cup holders behind the center armrest (sounds insignificant but it is actually very nice for someone who drinks a lot of pop).  I also like the heated mirrors and the location of the map lights.  Even little things like the extra air vent under the steering wheel and the lock feature on the glove box are nice.  I was a litte confused why the &quot;Rear Privacy Tint&quot; didn't include the Read window, but after a $40 tint at a shop down the street, its almost impossible to see in to the rear of my Passport (especially with the pull-over cover in the cargo area).  The V6 engine is superb and with the optional &quot;Power&quot; button, the Passport really hauls going up on-ramps.  The 4-wheel drive is as advertised: Easy push button operation.  I took a 4000 mile road trip to Labrador Canada and had to drive 300 miles of Gravel highway.  The 4-wheel drive saved my butt more than a few times.  It's nice to know that no matter where I am I can park just about anywhere without fear of getting stuck.  During every snow storm, my Passport has handled very well and has only slid once.  Overall, everything that I wanted in an SUV, I found in the passport.
   
There were some things after driving for a year that I would have liked to see in the passport or that I think weren't done as well as they should have been.  As I'm sure everyone knows, the location of the 4-wheel drive button is rather poor.  I have hit it by accident going 75 on the highway instead of the cruise control button.  I also would have liked to have had more compartments for storage.  Maybe a few in the side armrests or even a sunglasses holder by the moon-roof switch.  I also would have liked electric seats....maybe even heated.  Another thing that really irks me is that there is no real coin holders.  There is a little upright slot in the center armrest that holds about 6 quarters, that when full rattles like crazy.  I have given up and just put all of my change in the ash tray.  I would have also liked to see a digital odometer readout. The whole dashboard display/control readout seems a little outdated.  For anyone who hasn't test driven a Passport, don't put your head back in the seat either because the headrests are horrible.  Something that also bothers me is that the lighted vanity mirrors only light up if you have the headlights on.  Not quite sure why this was done this way.  Also, the fog lights will only go on if the low-beams are on.  All of these things really have not changed my opinion of the Passport.  In fact most of these things really are just me making a &quot;perfect vehicle&quot; wishlist.  

There have been a few experiences that I have had, that did change some of my opinions of the Passport.  When I read that the Passport is not really a Honda but rather an Isuzu, I though &quot;So what&quot;.  This did come back to haunt me terribly.  I got into a small accident in December in my Passport that resulted in me needing a new front bumper and fog light assembly as well as a new front right side fender.  When the Honda Collision center went to order these parts, it took almost a month to get them from Isuzu.  Luckily I could still drive my Passport and I didn't have to rent a vehicle for a month.  Just something that made me a little uneasy about getting parts down the line.  Also, there have been two recalls which have been more annoying than anything.  Its hard for me to get to the dealership to get a recall for &quot;bad bolts&quot; fixed when I work 45-50 hours a week.  As far as the gas mileage, I guess I really just wasn't prepared for it, being a former Ford escort owner.  In all honesty, the gas mileage is very poor, but that can be expected from any SUV.  I did manage to get around 22 mpg (highway) on the trip to Canada that I took but even still I spend around 40-50 dollars a week on gas.  

Despite all that has happened good and bad, This was and will always still be the first car that I bought that was exactly what I wanted.  I saved a lot of money buying my Passport right as the 2000 models were coming out.  I actually got the dealer down to about 25,000 dollars, so I can't complain about the cost.  

Overall, I would recommend a Passport to anyone looking to get a reliable SUV.  I have read on-line that Honda has changed a few of the things that I wrote about above that needed improvement.  Just make sure with any purchase you do what I did: Go out and research as much as you can and make sure you are really getting what you want.  It's a good feeling when even a year after you buy a car, you still get excited about getting driving it.<br><br>
