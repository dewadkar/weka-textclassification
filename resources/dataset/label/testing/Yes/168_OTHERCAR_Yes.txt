            After returning the first digital camera I purchased (a Sony MVC) I decided to do some intense research on digital cameras.  I decided on the Fuji MX-1200 because of all the great reviews it received and the low price.  However, I have found that my pictures are not consistently good.  Most that are taken outdoors are excellent, indoor photos however, are sometimes a disappointment. I took family photos on Thanksgiving using different file sizes, quality and sharpness.  Most of the pictures were grainy and blurry. I keep thinking that I must be doing something wrong because everyone else seems to think this camera is consistently excellent.
 
Downloading the camera to the computer took forever so I bought a  Smart Media card reader which downloads almost instantly and a 32MB card on e-bay and and I am very, very happy with both of these items. The software that came with the camera is excellent.  

Overall, I do like this camera and I would recommend it to any new digital photographer.

Who should buy it?  Anyone wishing to send pictures in e-mail or for a web site.
