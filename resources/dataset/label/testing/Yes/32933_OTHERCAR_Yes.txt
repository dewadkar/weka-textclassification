            When I bought this car I was impressed with it's looks, price, and gas mileage but it was replacing my '88 Grand Am which I loved and I didn't get the thrill that I got when I drove the Grand Am home. It lived up to my expectations though and as I got used to it I had to admit that it had a better ride, handled as well, and was just plain more comfortable. As the years went by without any trouble I became more and more amazed that it never needed repairs.  Oh, I replaced bulbs and  brakes and changed fluids regularly but the front tires lasted 87,000 miles and were still marginally safe.  The rear tires were replaced at 107,000 miles. As I write this I can hardly believe it myself but quality parts were used throughout.(Michelin) I finally changed the spark plugs at 120,000 because I figured I should. 

I got a letter from Buick when the car had 65,000 miles saying that there was a problem with the engine head which could cause it to crack. If this happened they would replace the head free of charge.  At 97,000 miles there was evidence that the head was cracked. Buick replaced it with a new modified head at no cost. At 142,000 miles the transmission started to shift rough. I had it rebuilt at a cost of 1200 dollars. It happened because I didn't change the trans oil and filter every 36,000 miles.

At 158,000 miles while on a long trip I noticed that the gas mileage had increased from the usual 30.5 to 32.4 mpg. I can't explain why but I changed the brake rotors and pads and gave it it's first tune up just before we left. I did the tune up just because I thought I should.

Now this car has been on the road for nine years and has 167,000 miles on her. She has every reason to be tired, rusty, and headed to the junk yard but she just keeps on going, using no oil, with her original exaust system and still getting 32 mpg. I expect to see her flip over 200,000 sometime next year and I truly believe she will still look and run good.  I was 44 years old when I brought her home and my son said, &quot;Don't you think that car is a little young for you&quot;?  I didn't think so then but now at 53 it might be.

Good things have a way of passing too soon.  Buick made a gem in 1992. I will keep her 'til she dies. When she finally gives up the ghost it will certainly be too soon<br><br>
