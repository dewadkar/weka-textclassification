            This car is aimed at the younger age crowd with  its economical price, hard to access back seats.(although overall roomy interior), great gas milage, and reputation for being one of the more reliable cars on the market.
These factors all add up to a awesome car for those on a budget. 
Although those with more money to spend, would probably appreciate the accord or higher up models which offer much more comfort/ride and class, the Civic fits the bill for what its designed for.

For a compact, this car has some really sleek stylish lines to it, and is quite an eye catch especially if you like to modify your car...and if thats the case....The aftermarket parts for this car are just blowing up. 
If you drop in any aftermarket parts store, you will find mounds of accessories to completely customize your ride in no time flat - making this car great for us young people who like to make a car that stands out in the crowd.
