            I've always been a big fan of &quot;imports&quot; such as Honda and Toyota and had an array of old early 70 Bugs in my driveway when on a fluke I was introduced to a used 1985 Subaru and it was love at first sight.  After &quot;cheating on Subaru&quot; for a brief stint with a Jeep (which I'll NEVER do again), I came back to Subaru in 1995 when the Outback was nothing more than a glamorized Legacy.  I currently drive a 1998 Outback Limited and I absolutely love it though there are some things that bug me that I'll get to in a minute.

After the Jeep fiasco, I briefly considered a slightly used Toyota Camry wagon (need a wagon because of my Great Danes, thus my screenname :-) but living in the snow belt of PA, the Subaru all wheel drive was a major consideration, plus when I looked at the price, I saw that they were comparable. (Remember that as a general rule of thumb, for every $1000 in price that you finance, you'll pay about $22 a month in car payment... unless you have lousy credit and get a high interest rate or you go for one of those special deal rates that require you to pay the thing off in record time.)  So when I looked at my monthly cost factor, I decided to go new and spring for the Subaru.  

Every time a snowflake falls from the sky, or wet leaves coat the pavement, I thank Subaru for getting me safely home.  With its ABS brakes, to its intelligent AWD system, this is a vehicle that you can rely on and  with its low center of gravity compared to something like the Chevy Blazer, I have yet to see one flipped on its side because the idiot driver thinks that AWD or 4WD means you can drive like a putz in the worse of weather.  

From the optional front seat &quot;butt warmers, to the heated side mirrors, this vehicle was made to surround you in comfort when the world is going through another ice age. 

For the most part the reliability of this vehicle is right up there with the best of them though in my humble opinion, it isn't as reliable as when they were built overseas.  (Both my 1995 and my 1998 have had recalls which I find bothersome. Forgive me for believing that if I spend $20,000 plus for a vehicle, I expect it to only require routine maintenance at least until it is pretty much paid off at the bank at the end of 5 years.) 

I found it funny when I reviewed Consumer Reports before I bought my 1998 Outback and read that their biggest complaint was the location of the cupholder... but after driving the car for two years, on and off road down to our favorite fishing holes, I agree! My temperature controls and my CD player have both been splashed from an open can of pop (that's soda for all of you non-Pittsburghers)and are stickier than a two year old in a candy store.   But in all honesty, I haven't figured out a better place to put a cupholder so maybe I should just learn to live without my Pepsi when I'm on an excursion.

A minor complaint is price.  Used to be that Subaru was an inexpensive yet top quality 4WD vehicle that not too many people knew about but those who did loved with almost a cult like obsession.  (Still call mine a Scooby Doo).  I do understand the dynamics of supply and demand (and the cost of American labor versus overseas) and with the aggressive advertising that Subaru has done since the introduction of the Outback, I give them credit for bringing their company out of the closet but if it wasn't for the Forester or the Impreza, Subaru would have effectively locked out a number of the middle class folk who drove their cars when no one else would. 

But even when you look at options and features as compared to the Chevy Blazer or any of the other SUV's, even the higher priced Legacy and Outback series is a tremendous value.  As for Toyota and Honda, they have tried to make inroads in this market but Subaru truly is the King of the AWD Hill. They climbed that mountain long before other &quot;traditional&quot; car manufacturer's did and Subaru will continue to be on top.  

Subaru knows what they do right and they do it well.  

Looking for a great vehicle? Screech your current sent of tires as fast as the rubber will lay to your nearest Subaru dealer.  You won't regret it.<br><br>
