            I bought this car while in college.  It was cheaper than all others in it's class.  I did all the typical research, using consumer reports and blue books.  
I love the fact that it almost never breaks down.  I have had the car for five years.  I have driven it 2,500 miles from Massachusetts to Texas and back.  I have lived with it in the Texas heat and in the Massachusetts cold.  it is a very dependable car.  I would recomend it to anyone who didn't want to worry about car maintenance. It is very user friendly to those who know nothing about cars.  

I have been in a few accidents and the car repaired to new.  There have been no residual &quot;ghost&quot; problems.

The Saturn dealerships really are caring places.  I get invited to the reunion every year.  I went to a new car seminar and a barbque at my dealership after I bought the car.  It's just like the advertisements!

I only wish my car had a bigger engine and were sportier.  I would probably by another Saturn with all the bells and whistles like power doors and windows and a sun roof.<br><br>
