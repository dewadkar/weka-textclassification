            I originally bought a Saturn because I had heard such fantastic things about the cars and the company.  It's true, I did receive the legendary Saturn Customer Service- even when a problem with my bank caused them to be without some of my money for a time!  But it wasn't until this last winter that I have truly come to appreciate my '93 SL2 for all that it is.  I took it into the mountains, in the snow, for the first time.  It drove like a champ! The steering and traction on this car are amazing!  I felt totally in control the whole time.  I cannot recommend this car highly enough for those of you who deal with winter weather but do not want a truck.  You won't regret it!<br><br>
