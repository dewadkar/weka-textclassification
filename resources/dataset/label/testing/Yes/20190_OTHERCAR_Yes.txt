            This past winter we had a new baby on its way.  That seemed like a good enough reason to purchase a digital camera.  After a thorough review of the leading brands including Canon, Olympus, Fuji, and Nikon, I determined the Minolta S304 best met my needs.  In the seven months since buying this beauty, I have not been disappointed.

You can see all the specs on Epinions� product page, so I�ll just go over the highlights here.  First, with 3.3 MP (mega-pixels) I have been able to produce very nice prints in sizes ranging up to 8x10.  I needed no more than this which is why I didn�t go to the extra expense and memory requirements of a higher MP camera. Next, the 4X optical zoom is slightly higher than most similar cameras.  Sure, they all also have digital zoom, but this is as much of a marketing gimmick as it is a real feature.  You can accomplish the same effect through cropping.  

How is the auto-focus?  When taking a picture, pressing the button part way down will lock in the focus and show a small rectangle on the screen indicating where exactly the focus point is.  When I take the time to make sure it is focusing on what I want it to, the pictures always come out nice.  Sometimes it takes a few tries though.

How is the exposure?  In automatic mode, it is moderately good.  I will say however that on auto flash, the shots sometime seem a bit washed out.  I�ve found that using fill flash instead produces better results.

Another nice thing this camera is that it takes AA batteries.  Though you wouldn�t want to normally use regular alkaline batteries since it would eat them up to quickly, if you really were in a pinch, they are easy to find.

I�ll now go into some of the things that could be better.  First is the overall size.  I would like if the camera were a bit less thick.  Something else that could be improved is the interface for the manual mode.  It is all menu driven and does not seem too intuitive to me.  Luckily, I rarely feel the need to use it since the automatic mode works so nicely.

The camera comes with 16 Meg memory card, which honestly is a bit small.  The pictures I take are each about 2 Megs (this is the second highest quality setting), so the 16 Meg card would only hold about 8 shots.

One other minor thing is the way the lens moves.  When the camera is off it is fully retracted (which makes sense).  When you turn the camera on, the lens comes out.  This is fine for modes where I am going to be taking pictures, but makes no sense for other modes such as playback or transfer.  It seems like an unnecessary toil on the mechanics and a waste of the batteries.

The proof is in the pudding.  If you would like to see shots I�ve taken with this camera, please take a look at http://www.pbase.com/ender  There are a variety of indoor and outdoor shots, including pictures of my new baby boy.
