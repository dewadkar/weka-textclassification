            Upon first reading about the 2002 Altima I have to say I was mightily impressed.
<p>
Here's some basic specs:
-240hp/246lb tq
-3.5L DOHC V6 (VQ series)
-5 speed manual transmission
-Leather/Sport package
-ABS/Side Airbags
<p>
The Altima I test drove was pretty much fully loaded. The feature content was very impressive. Heated front seats, Bose 6dc in-dash stereo, side airbags, electronic brake distribution (EBD), power moonroof, etc.

<b>Exterior</b>
Upon doing the typical first walk-around a couple things stand out. The door seams are very tight, and seem very uniform throughout the entire car. The taillights are very nice looking, especially on the black car that I am reviewing. The car is very classy looking, but not boring like so many other midsize sedans.
<p>
<b>Interior</b>
If there is only one shortcoming for this sports sedan it's the interior. It seems as though most of the budget went towards the engine and suspension, and no so much inside the car. However, the pieces that are obviously a little out of place are not offending. In whole, the interior is very spacious, pleasant looking, and well put together. The leather seats are of nice texture, and the dash and radio controls are very easy to operate and read. The door panels are a little chinsy looking and feeling, but as I said, not offensively so.
<p>
<b>Ride & Drive</b>
I love power. I love power tools, powerful engines, powerful movies. Thus, I love the Altima's engine. The 240hp V6 is a significant class above most competitors at this price range. The Camry V6 pales in comparison, and the Accord simply doesn't have the torque this VQ masterpiece does. It pulls strongly, and very smoothly from just about any rpm all the way up to it's lofty 6,600 rpm redline. It is nearly silent at idle, and zero vibration was felt while sitting at stoplights. But, when you want it to go, it sings a song not unlike an Inline-6 from BMW. 

The only slight disapointment is the shifter action. After driving a couple Honda's and Mazda's the Altima's shifter just feels a little less precise. However, I did not miss any gears during the entire 30 minute drive, and clutch engagement was smooth and very positive. 

Ride is definitely on the firm side of the scale for a family car. Do not mistake this for your grandpa's Camry. It handles most surfaces well, but with a little more road noise than the Accord/Camry/Taurus. However, this is more than ofset when you want to drive it, not let it drive you. It corners flat, with moderate understeer, but never so much it is intrusive. 
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
If I am to consider this car at it's MSRP ($28k), my review may not be as favorable. That's getting close to Acura TL-S territory. However, most people are not paying MSRP for any new car these days. I was told by the dealer that I could have this Altima at $500 over invoice, or $26.5k. There is no other car in this segment that offers 240hp, 5 speed manual trans, HID headlights, leather seating, and is sizeable enough for the whole family.

If you have a family, and you still have that extra need for some excitement look no further.
