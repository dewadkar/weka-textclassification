            i bought this vehicle after reading many positive reviews in consumer reports and other auto magazines and due to the great reputation for Mitsubishi vehicles and also, because it is simply the best rated convertible on the market.I believe everyone should own/drive a convertible before they die, because it is an unforgettable and uplifting experience! young, old should own this car!

the things i love about this vehicle are the ease of the automatic convertible top! i have previously owned 2 other convertibles and this top is too easy to maneuver! it is a very sexy looking convertible and you will get many looks , driving this car in the summer! It is also very maneuverable convertible and hugs the road well. If you choose the mitsubishi sound system, you wont regret it , because it is top notch! 

the things i hate about this vehicle are the poor gas milage and the way the rain gets you wet inside the vehicle due to poor window placement/size.  be prepared to take another car, if it looks like rain...you will get wet if your window is open , even a crack ..and i mean wet...your pants are hit the  hardest!!also, i dislike the poor visability in this vehicle due to small angled windows in front and rear...very poor rear visability! but these are downfalls of most convertibles today. 

this car is very easy to drive due to the front wheel drive suspension ( i was almost killed in a rear wheel drive convertible!) and its maneuverablility is superb! This car is great for old and young alike, but not recommended for transporting children for safety reasons and small rear area. I strongly recommend this vehicle as a great and reliable convertible for the price!<br><br>
