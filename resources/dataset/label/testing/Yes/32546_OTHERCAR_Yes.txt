            IT took me 4 years to finally decide to give up my really nice 35mm film camera... So my research on which Digital Camera to buy began 60 days ago. I had no idea what to buy but I knew what I wanted. What I discovered was that "KODAK", a film maker, is offering a product like the DX6490. 

I looked at ALL the cameras on the market! It didn't take long to realize that what I wanted was a Digital camera that would cost $3000.00 or more! Since my money tree isn't in bloom right now, and I probably have more sense than money, I opted for the MOST camera for the LEAST money up to $1500. The features I insist on are: A large and very bright, clear LCD screen (over 2 inches), a high resolution view finder "through the lens" in excess of 150k and in color, more than 8x of "Optical" zoom, enough pixels to print 20x33!

I very much want high quality glass or at least a removable lens.  Well; I could get some of these for $1200+ But all of them from a camera made by KODAK? and I paid $448.00...?? I was very surprised! Not only because  all my desires were met, but exceeded by quite a bit! 

A Schnieder-Kreuznach-Variogon 10x optical lens is a VERY delightful surprise! This is a BIG piece of glass compared to any other camera! It's not removable and isn't threaded to accept filters, but many filter options can be accomplished with internal software. A built in flash is feature rich, easy to use but somewhat anemic in the power category. The DX6490 does have an external electronic flash connector for those "Mega-watt" night mountain range shots!... I read about complaints concerning the lack of a manual "white balance" feature. There is however a manual "Lighter/darker" adjustment available on the screen but it has never provided improved picture quality over the cameras computer setting. In the "Aperture/speed" Overide mode,"Program" Overide mode, or "Full manual" mode, the DX6490 offers a "ISO" setting option. This is a film camera throw-back, but is a GREAT feature for those of us that have heavy film camera usage and understand the information it offers. The range is 80-100-200-400-800. 

The controls are simple, easy to use and well laid out. Yes,it is easy to smudge the LCD screen, but this is such a small issue compared to what this camera offers! The really big surprise is the docking station it comes with! 

Drop the camera on the docking station and the rechargeable LIoN battery recharges. I took 300 hi-res pictures with an optional 256Mb card with room for hundreds more. Battery capacity has never been an issue, it seems to have more than enough.

With your computer running and the camera powered off/on and the camera in its dock, press one button on the docking station and up go your pictures to your hard drive! 

The included software, or latest version from the Kodak web site is very simple to use and is intuitive. It allows for some picture editing, but one of the nice features is the ability to create "Albums" (that's folders for you and I). These Albums can then be downloaded to the camera. When you set one of these folders as the active album in the camera, all pictures taken will go into this album. When the pictures are uploaded, they will then go into the matching Album on the hard drive! 

So what about the bottom line?

4 megapixel will print clearly to 20x33. The pictures are STUNNING! The colors are vivid, crisp, clear, rich, and real eye candy! I still can't believe what an outstanding camera this is for what I paid! There are many more features that I haven't mentioned! Like VIDEO with sound! OK, it's not a $700.00 Video camera. But if your not into video, like us, the few we do shoot are more than adequate for us! Our 256Mb card shoots about 30 minutes worth. A 512Mb card shoots a bit more than an hours worth.

Some Cons: If you want clear crisp shots over 3 or 4x, Have a good solid tripod on hand. All of my shots into the sun at sunset or 10 or so minutes before, have some sort of lens reflection issue. Either a round orange spot about 1/3 inch in diameter somewhere in the picture, or orange banding across the picture. Shooting into an intense sun will also bring out a solid white line across the view finder or LCD. The line doesn't show up in the picture. The other issues can all be corrected using Adobe.

The camera doesn't come with a camera bag. The small bags are too small, and the medium bags are too big! I'm still looking.

There is no question in my mind that I have found THE MOST camera for my dollar! This is an amazing camera for the price! Cameras in the $1000. to $1500. range can't compete with this camera! Megapixel count isn't everything in a digital camera! Optical quality is an equal factor considering resolution requirements. Beyond that, optics is the only big issue! I.e. $3000.00+

I kept all packing contents and planned on returning this camera within 30 days if it didn't live up to my expectation. My camera budget was $1600.00. My film camera is a Minolta Maxim 7000 Pro. w/f1.2 50mm lens. I've had this Kodak for 30 days and have taken in excess of 2000 picture with it.

The pictures that the DX6490 takes are WOW quality.
