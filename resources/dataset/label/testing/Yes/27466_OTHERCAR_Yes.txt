            There's nothing like a used car!  All the bugs have already shown up, and all you have left to do is deal with them!

When my best friend's little Mercury Topaz finally gave up, her mother was very kind in giving her her used Sable.

Personally I've never been very fond of Ford products, usually opting for a General Motors or Foreign vehicle when I could.

I must say, however that this is a very fine car overall. 

<i>[ I love when my friend says &quot;why don't you take my car?&quot; * smile * ]</i>

<b>Size IS Important</b>

We're going to start out talking about <i>ENGINE</i> size that is. This car has a six cylinder engine in it. It gets good enough pickup, and hums along very well at 65MPH, but it just seems like it could get a bit better gas mileage. I'd estimate it's getting somewhere about 20-25 highway, and considerably less in the city.  This is one of those times where it would be better to have that 8-cylinder pulling the weight around.

<b>Size IS Important (Part II)</b>

The interior of this car is very large, the rear seats are more than comfortable, and I don't find myself putting my knees up on the dashboard when I'm sitting in the front. As, for the trunk space, it's got almost as much room as my full-sized Chevy Caprice Station Wagon.  Unless you plan on moving a couch or a refrigerator, this should be fine for most everyone!

<b>Gizmo Or The Gremlins?</b>

There's a few quirks with this car ... the first has to do with the passenger side power window. In order to put the window down, you must press &quot;up&quot;, in order to put the window back up again, you must press &quot;down&quot;.  This not only applies for the passenger's controls, but also the drivers side master set of controls.  The other three windows seems to work fine in the car :)

The Delay Wiper controls also seem a bit out of whack ... the switch ( located on the directional signal control) just doesn't seem to &quot;click&quot; right. The delay sometimes doesn't work, and the wipers shut off completely when you put on your directional light. (when using the delay wipers,)

<b>The Price Of Luxury</b>

Being a Mercury, the Sable tends to be a little &quot;spiffier&quot; than the Ford Taurus. One of those little &quot;spiffy&quot; things is the back-lit plastic grill across the front of the car. There's four little bulbs in there which were all burned out when my friend got the car.  I hadn't noticed really until I saw a number of other sables around town. After closer inspection, sure enough .. ALL FOUR bulbs were burned out. Hoping this was not another electrical &quot;quirk&quot; I promised I would purchase and replace the bulbs. That was my mistake. Turns out these are little halogen bulbs that cost $6.00 at one auto store, $8.00 at another - a piece!  Naturally I went to Wal-Mart and got them for $5.00, but it's still $20.00 which seems a little expensive for some decorative lighting.

<b>Go Speed Racer!</b>

Even with the six cylinder engine, this car just wants to go. There's never any problem with pick up, and as I've said it just hums along. Cruising, even at 65MPH, the RPM's usually stay below 2,000.

<b>Rock and Roll?</b>

Nope! This car does neither!  Great handling around curves in the road, up and down hills, and those pesky, forever bending, on and off ramps for the thruway!  I never feel as if I don't have control of the vehicle. Driving is as smooth winding through the hills of Livingston County, New York, as it is on the flat expressway lanes of Buffalo, New York!

<b>Winter Wonderland</b>

I had to bring it up ... after all we do get snow 355 days a year in Western New York, right ?  This car was great in the snow, the front wheel drive handled like a charm, The car hugs the ground well on all sorts of road slippery surfaces.

<b>Appearance Is Everything</b>

Finally this car looks great, it's over seven years old and doesn't have a spot of rust on it. That's something to brag about here in the Winter Road Salt Capital of The World. ( Or at least it seems that way sometimes).  The car's nice green / blue finish looks great still, well, if you don't count where the cat has slid off the hood with his pointy little claws!) All the trim, and little &quot;extras&quot; seem to be holding up fine as well.

<b>I'm not an Expert, I just play one on Epinions.com</b>

I don't know all the specifics about cars ... I know what fuel injection is, and that there are multi-valve engines and OHC (over head cams) and things, but I couldn't tell you what half of this stuff means.  What I CAN tell you is that this is a great car ... after years of owning this car, my neither my friend, or her mother has had any major problems with it. <i>[ and it still looks great too! YOOHOO!!!! ]</i>

<b>And They Lived Happily Ever After...</b>

I suppose what it all boils down to is this ... if you have a 1993 Mercury Sable, and it's in as good a shape as this one ... and you aren't happy with it ... drive it up to Western New York ... and give it to me!

<b>The Moral Of The Story</b>

I Like The Car!

<b><i>Sincerely,

John Malaise</i></b>
