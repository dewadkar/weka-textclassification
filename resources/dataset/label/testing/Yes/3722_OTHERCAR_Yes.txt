             Back in 1997, I purchased a used 1993 Chevy Silverado pick-up truck. Like the Chevy slogan, my Silverado was indeed &quot;LIKE A ROCK&quot;! A comfortable interior, and a stylish body design made my choice of the chevy silverado, an easy one. My truck had four-wheel drive, and if you live in any area where weather is an issue I strongly recommend it. The only complaint that I have is that they are not quite as roomy as a Dodge Ram, but Dodge doesn't hold a candle to the overall great truck that Chevy has made, the standard of trucks, in my opinion! I would recommend this vehicle to anyone, even if you are used to driving a car. Because it drives like a car. An A+ in my book!!!!<br><br>
