            OR someone who won't be using it much, because if you plan on taking lots of pictures with this digital camera you'll want an optical zoom feature.

The Smart Media cards are very useful as it allows you to change them and keep on shootin.  It would be nice if there was an option to get a rechargable nicad or lithium ion battery for this particular camera (like I've seen on many others) but as far as I know there isn't one.

I bought a 'starter kit' when I got mine, it had an 8MB Smart Media card, a camera case, AC adapter, and a setup for your computer to hook it to, also with this, if you have the right connections, (you can get them at a camera shop) you can connect this camera directly to a laser, ink jet, or photo printer and print without a computer.... that's a nice feature.

Missing is still the optical zoom and also the ability to use floppy disks for 'film'.  The cards this camera uses can be quite costly and also very delicate.

I've taken some nice nature photos with mine, but when I get the money I will be in the market for something a little more Up-Scale<br><br>
