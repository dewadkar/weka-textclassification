            I am, still, the proud owner of a 1999 Ford Escort ZX2. I was forced to sell the lease of a car, which I had come to adore, because of relocating from a lower southern state to a very northern one. I was definitely not a happy camper. When it comes to the big ticket items, I am extremely hard to please. I must have test drove at least a dozen cars, and each dealership was promising me the moon. My family and I would get excited just as the salesman handed us over to management who was very sorry, but that car is just a little out of your price range. Then the pitch to help me out by selling me a used up, used car at a great price followed. At the time I was forced to rely on public transportation. I do not have any ill thoughts towards riding the bus, but I found that their schedule did not always match mine. I was at my rope's end, when we pulled into the Ford dealership. I had resigned myself to lower my standards and to accept the first automobile they presented in my price range.
I walked into the dealership and walked right up to the first suit and tie I laid eyes on. Out of frustration and car lot abuse, I looked this total stranger in the eye and strongly stated who I was, as I shoved my hand into his and shook it up and down with quite a bit of force. This well dressed gentleman opened his mouth to speak, but I raised my hand to shush him, and informed him of what I wanted...how I wanted it...and exactly to the penny what I was willing to pay for it. There was laughter behind me and I reeled around to give them the low down on how people just like them push the gentle trusting souls, like me, over the edge, beyond civility. The man, now behind me, tapped me on the shoulder and whispered in my ear &quot;I am only a customer, but, if this were my dealership, with your attitude, I would highly recommend the Ford Escort.&quot;. I am sure my face deepened to the color of roses, as I timidly approached the sales counter and looked the girl, who had laughed at me, in the eye, and stated &quot;And I do believe that a Ford Escort should be satisfactory.&quot; 
I did drive away that very day in my spanking new, 1999 Ford Escort ZX2. The color was right, and the trunk was enormous. It was a two door, economy that felt like a luxury model. The price may not have been right, but my Ford dealer worked his magic numbers, and gave me and my family a very happy ending! Thank you Ford, and thank you nice man in the suit and tie!    <br><br>
