               Recently i purchased a 1992 Ford Thunderbird LX. I fell in love with it's style and how sleek it was. I sat inside and it was instant comfort, it felt like home. I bought the car and to my suprise it drove better than a 4x4 ranger in the snow. This car is black with black leather interior,
 5.0 HO, automatic, loaded and i mean loaded. 
    I love the way this car drives, the transmission is nice and tight; the gas petal is hard at first and then easy to the floor. When you floor the car off the start the tires roar. I've only floored it off the start twice, i try not to beat on it. Other than that i'm generally nice to the car i just give it your average daily work out. Ever since i bought a K&amp;N air filter for it i get much better gas mileage and it added 10 HP to my car too. I used to only get about 11 or 12 miles to the gallon, now i get about 16.5 and thats not driving it perfectly either.
   I think thunderbirds are pretty much for everybody, if you don't like all the things i've described than a bird wouldn't be right for you. The reason why i love these cars so much is because i've watched them change through out the years and every year they keep getting better. Look for them soon, i'm sure they'll be back.   <br><br>
