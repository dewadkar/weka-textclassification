            It seems that many people buy SUV's for use primarily under normal highway conditions, but this is not why I bought my RAV4.  

I got this RAV4 originally as a lease when my 1990 Subaru Loyale finally died, after an expensive few years.  I was not going to get another Subaru, and had had Toyotas recommended for their reliability.  When the lease ran out, I purchased the vehicle.  Although I suppose it was not the best deal, it has been exactly the vehicle I need.

I live in northern New England, on the top of a hill, on a not particularly well-maintained road.  I also have a job where I cannot often use the &quot;bad roads&quot; excuse for missing work.  When we have snow, the road is never plowed before I must leave for work.  I needed something with good traction, that was easy to drive, and had clearance to get over the snow.  Although my old Subaru had good traction, I feel that the low clearance and the fact that in high snow I tended to plow a lot in front of me was one of the reasons for all the mechanical trouble I had.  I also did not want a large vehicle and was somewhat concerned about gas mileage.  The RAV4 isn't great with mileage but much better than the full sized SUV's.  It is also very easy to parallel park.

I have now had this RAV4 for nearly 4 years.  It has performed wonderfully in snow, ice and other bad road conditions.  The few times I've gone off the road, I've been able to drive right back on.  I've read a few of the other opinions which mention lack of power, but have not found this to be a problem on these hills (but I drive a standard).

I have not had a single major or expensive mechanical problem.

Any complaints about the vehicle are more about styling and interior problems.  First, the large back door opens on the &quot;wrong&quot; side if you are parallel parked along a street -- you must load from the street side.  As my kids get older and taller, the back seats are getting a little cramped.  The front seats are roomy and comfortable enough.  Also, the back is designed so that loose items in the back easily roll out.  

I have had an ongoing problem with the driver's door.  I had to have the lock replaced as it was sticking.  Also, the seatbelt never quite retracted correctly, and slamming the door on it has broken the &quot;closed door indicator&quot;.<br><br>
