             I bought this car 3 years ago because I needed a reliable car to drive long distances with my two kids. It was two years old and had 30,000 miles on it when I bought it. I had to replace the alternator on it the first year, but after that with regular maintenance I have had no problems.  I feel safe in this car, which is very important to me, very trustworthy. I traded a ford tempo in for this car, so the driving with the olds is like heaven, quiet, and smooth. I don't really hate anything about the olds, but a few things are quite annoying like...the daytime running lights.  You can not shut them off, and people flash you all time telling you your lights are on. But then it is a safety feature so I can live with it.  The knob on my stereo has broken off, but my child also used it as a stepping ladder, so can't blame the car. The middle armrest cup-holder broke off, due to same problem with child.  I would recommend this car for the small family, or business person. I wouldn't recommend it to a teenager, or someone that wants that &quot;cool&quot; look.<br><br>
