            I've had this truck for about a month now and OH MY GAWD! I love this truck just as if I drove it off the lot yesterday! I got a hard Tonneau cover for it, and it had plenty of room, inside and out for my move from California up to Washington. The 4.7L V8 has more than enough power for my use, and it's a great head-turner! On my trip, I got at least 1-2 compliments every time I stopped. This is a great looking truck, and it is not skimpy on the passenger room either. My wife and I were looking at SUV's alot (Explorers, Blazers, 4-Runners, Durangos) and we decided on this because it gave us both what we wanted. She wanted to be able to fit more than two people (reasonably) in the truck, and also carry around a good amount of cargo. Well, this truck does all that and more! I've fit four adults, comfortably, in this truck. I've sat in the back of a Dakota club cab, and this thing has MUCH more room. It's a great truck, and I just can't say enough! At this point, if given the chance, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!

Probably the only thing that took a little getting used to, for me, was the handling. It's been about four years since I have driven a truck, and getting used to this suspension, after driving a Mustang, is a little difficult. You can't whip around the corners, but that's not what this vehicle is meant to do anyways. It serves it's purpose superbly. It is able to carry people, and anything else you would want to haul around, easily, but I have yet to test its towing ability. I look forward to strapping the Sea-doos to the hitch this Summer, and taking it to the lake. MAN! What a great truck!<br><br>
