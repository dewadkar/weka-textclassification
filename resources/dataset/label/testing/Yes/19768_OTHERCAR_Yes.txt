            I inherited a 1988 Mazda 626 with 140,000 miles on it from my father and we drove it until it was 12 years old and had 240,000 miles on it.  It had a 4 cylinder engine and manual transmission and we never did anything to it except replace mufflers, brakes and the clutch a couple times.

I have been lusting after the Millenia since 1995 or 1996 but never purchased one.  When we were looking for a new car I did some exhaustive research and discovered that the 1998 626 ES had the same 6-cylinder engine as the Millenia and it came with leather interior and all of the dimensions were slightly larger than the Millenia.  Even the grill was redesigned to make it look more like the Millenia.

We bought our 1998 when it was 1 year old and had 10,000 miles on it.  We have been happy ever since.  It has every option except power passenger seat.  The only thing that had to be repaired was the A/C compressor which was covered under warranty.

Specific likes include:

- Bose stereo sounds good
- leather interior and fake wood add a bit of class
- car will carry 5 people comfortably (3 adults in back will be a bit crowded)
- 60/40 split rear seat is handy because we can fold half down without moving our daughter's car seat
- engine is great, very good pickup
- steering is solid, without too much boost in the power assist
- ride is comfortable on long drives
- cheaper than an Accord or Camry ($16k for a 1-yr old car with 10k miles and all options)

Specific dislikes include:

- the styling is fairly uninspired
- the trunk could be bigger
