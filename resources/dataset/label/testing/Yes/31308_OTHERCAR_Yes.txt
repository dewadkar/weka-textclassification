            Update: May 5, 2003
After having this car for a little over a year I wanted to provide my impressions.

I still think it's a great car; however, I do plan on bringing it back to the dealer after the lease has ended and maybe get an MDX.

Here are my reasons why:
- While I still stand by all my previous comments, I still have doubts on overall reliability.  During this past year I have brought my car in because one-touch up on passenger window stopped working (took to dealer 4 times before was fixed correctly), two recalls, rear windshield wiper went haywire, and now my telescopic steering wheel makes a awful noise when it goes into the dash.  All these things are covered under warranty.  And they are not big things.  But when you buy a car this expensive it is quite annoying that it even does these things.  I am glad that I leased it.  I feel that after I finish out my remaining two years I would have had enough and ready for something new.

A friend of mine also recently purchased a 2001 3.0 X5 sport, premium used for three years with 30K miles on it.  My guess is it came off of a lease.  It's been in the shop so many times I lost count.  They don't seem to mind since they like the car so much but I couldn't help wondering if that would be me if I purchased my car after the lease.  And remember by then everytime you visit the dealer it's out of your pocket. I can't see myself shelling out $500 minimum and quite possibly more every month.  And I noticed that her problems aren't small.  One of her major things is the oil burning and/or leaking.  They haven't figured it out -- she's brought it in at least 5 times for the same problem.  Yikes.

And the final reason why is that I really need a 7 seater.  After having guests come visit us I'm tired of squeezing or having one of us sit in the trunk. (I know, not legal but sometimes you are only going to a restuarant 5 mins away and hate to drive two cars).  Plus I have to tell my family to pack light when I have to pick them up at the airport because there isn't enough room for more than one or two large suitcases.  Two large suitcases is really pushing it too and by then we've got all the carryons on our lap.  Not very graceful.

We leased a 3.0 X5 in Feb '02. What a joy to drive! 

I initially was looking at the Acura MDX mainly for the 7-passenger seating for the occasional out of town guests that we have.  But then BMW had a lease deal that made it more cost effective than leasing the MDX and we went for it.

This is our first BMW. Wow, this is what we've been missing all these years. The handling on this car is amazing, especially on an SUV. It hugs the road tight and you can accelerate on curvy mountain roads. Never could do that before in my Honda Accord.  It also feels more solid and sturdier than other SUV's.

Most people who purchase this car have a lot of cash to throw around and load it up with all kinds of options. We don't fall into that category and only got Automatic trans, cold weather package and sunroof. That's it.  Personally this is a great choice for us. I have two young kids that would destroy the leather.  Some people look at you funny when you say you have leatherette but once they see it they can't believe it's not the real thing. And the best part is all I have to do is Windex and a paper towel and it's good as new. The other plus of not having a lot of options is that there less electrical stuff to break down. I read on BMW message boards what the problems people have and then I realize that I don't have this or that option so nothing to worry about.

I do have concerns about long term reliability. That's why I leased. It gives me three years to check out this car and if it breaks down a lot I get to give it back. If it doesn't I will probably keep this car. So far nothing else out there is this fun to drive.

Averaging about 14 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on highway.

3.0 engine is enough power for me. For those into a lot of horsepower it may not be enough. All I do is haul to kids around and mostly local roads with lots of traffic lights.
