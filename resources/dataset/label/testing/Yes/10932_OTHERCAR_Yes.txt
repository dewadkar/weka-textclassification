            UK review

If you want a classy estate car that does 50mpg and still goes well (10 seconds 0-60) then it's down to the VW Passat, The Audi A4 Avant Tdi, and the BMW 320d Touring.

I've spent ages looking into these choices, so let's save you the hassle:

the VW dealer was hopeless - can't get a car until next year when the new shape comes out, no idea what it will cost etc.  The car itself goes really well, looks good, but is still a VW and since it costs approximately the same as the Audi (assuming new model costs same as old) the Audi is probably a better option.

The Audi dealer was really good, and so was the car.  Feels really sporty to drive (I've got a BMW 325 so I've already been spoiled!) - I couldn't believe it was a diesel.  How it can do 50 mpg when it goes that fast beats me.  I'm sure it does though, because my old Audi 80 Tdi does 50 mpg even if I thrash it, (by the way, excellent car if you find a low mileage one - very reliable, practical etc).  The pedals feel really light (325 has heavy pedals and your knees ache after a long drive), the steering is light but positive, the A4 has a big boot (though not quite as big as the old Audi 80), excellent hifi as standard, (RDS etc) (hey if you haven't discovered RDS it's a must for motorway travellers who need to know about traffic jams) and the other good thing about the Audi is the modest appearance - smart but not flashy.

The BMW showroom is so classy it's scary.  It's all Yes Sir Certainly Sir Whatever you want sir.  The car:  also claims about 50 mpg but I suspect more like 45.  Still great for a 130 horsepower monster.  The Audi only has 115 (I say only, the old A4 diesel has 90 and goes OK, the 115hp A4 goes really well).  The 130hp BMW doesn't feel any quicker than the Audi, and in fact isn't any quicker 0-60, but it has more torque so it pulls at lower revs - you can almost do anything in any gear and it pulls like a bull.  The boot is smaller than the Audi but better than the old 3 touring since it doesn't have the rear lights intruding.  It has far more toys than the Audi, since you get (as standard) hifi controls on the steering wheel, beeper that tells you when you've reversed to within 6 inches of the car behind, auto-dipping mirror, tailgate with choice of opening just the window or the whole thing, wipers which automatically go to intermittent or even stop when you do, follow me home (lights stay on for 2 minutes while you get into your front door) etc etc.  The Audi cockpit felt empty and boring by comparison.  Also the BMW has major &quot;lust factor&quot; - everything about the exterior and interior is sexy to look at and feel.  So against the BMW we have smaller boot, maybe a bit too flashy, possibly less safe in the wet since it's rear wheel drive (though I must say that the automatic traction control made it feel rock solid, whereas my old 325i is lethal in the wet).  On the plus side are toys, torque, flash, costs the same as the Audi, and the clincher.... the air conditioning....

Both cars have aircon as standard, and with the Audi you can set the cabin temp to within half a degree and it stays there.  Pretty good.  But I'm old fashioned and I like cold air on my face and warm air on my feet - with the Audi you can't have this, and so I felt it was either cold or stuffy.  With the BMW you can have what you want.  So the BMW gets it.  CAR Magazine recently said the BMW 320d was the best car in the real world (forget Ferraris etc)and I think they might just be right - meanwhile Audi: sort out your Aircon and you'll have equalled BMW.<br><br>
