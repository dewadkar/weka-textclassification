            I purchased this camera after much research online and much in-store shopping.  I needed a good camera to take photos for my business website.  I saw many examples of photos taken with this camera and was very satisfied with the high quality, clear pictures.  After testing several other cameras, I also preferred how easy this camera was to operate and how compact it was.  The actual camera body felt sturdy and the little doors to the ports were well-applied for long lasting use.

I finally settled on this particular camera because it was the most camera for the money.  One of the features I was most interested in was the zoom capability and the LCD screen quality.  This camera was by far the most affordable anywhere that I looked, with the most features.

An important accessory that this camera includes is a cable to link directly to the computer's hard drive.  This feature makes it possible to download the pictures quickly and simply by just &quot;plugging in&quot;.

I highly recommend this camera to anyone for personal and/or business use, whether they have much computer or photography experience or not.  As a beginner myself, I found the instruction manuals simple to follow and began using the camera and software immediately, with great results.<br><br>
