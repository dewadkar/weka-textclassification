            Camry is not the number one car in America by coincidence!  It is very deserving of it's premier status.  My husband owns a 1998 Camry XLE and loves it!  It has more than enough power to get me into and out of any situation imaginable.  The ride is very smooth and very quiet.  The stereo system is unmatched.  I simply put gas in it and follow the maintenance schedule and I have NEVER had a single problem with it.The service technicians have been consistently excellent.  

All major car reviews have rated the Camry on top.  The only negative I can think of is that because of it's weight, this car will not handle as nimbly as a lighter weight sports car and it's gas consumption will be a little more than your average sedan.  

When I drive it, I feel like I can really get around very easily with the power that is behind this engine.  It has great pickup ability and easy handling.  I have a smaller car so this one is a little bit larger than what I'm normally used to, but it doesn't seem to be a threat to drive.

All the options work great and the comfort is very good.  You sit back, relax, and go on down the road.  Adjusting the mirrors between drivers is so easy at the push of a button.  Same with the radio stations.  All in all, I think this is a great car.  We use it all the time when we go out together, and it's roomy enough to take all the kids along.
