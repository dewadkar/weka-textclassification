            This is one of the few remaining true muscle cars from the 60's.  However ugly.. You still get the muscle car experience.  Chevy rates the z28 as 285 horse power for insurance reasons.  But in actuallity its more like 315-325 horse power with 300 ft/lbs.  But something has changed.  Instead of bulky muscle car handling the camaro is lowered and has a semi racing suspension to help throw you through those corners just as fast you can accelerate past them.  It still has a somewhat plain interior, but you do have the option of leather.  Which is a very nice interior option.  It is also quite heavy which makes its cornering abilities quite impressive.  I recommend this to anyone who is too cheap to buy a vette :)  You can actually get a 93 for 9k.  But if you want the good stuff, thats in 98+.<br><br>
