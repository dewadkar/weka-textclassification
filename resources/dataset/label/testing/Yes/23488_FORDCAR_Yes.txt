            When my wife's 1994 Taurus LX blew a head gasket, we got an offer from Ford Motor Company that we couldn't refuse.  They agreed to either pay for the head gasket repair, OR, give us $4,000 credit toward the purchase of a new Ford.  This offer was on top of all other rebates and incentives.  This is why I am able to write a review of the new 2000 Ford Taurus SEL with the 24 valve DOC engine.

Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.  The Taurus is roomy and quiet on the inside, with radio preset buttons that are large and easy to push.  The leather interior is soft but not too mushy, and the trunk held enough junk for two adults and two small kids to travel out of town.

The 24 valve engine is quick and responsive, but I am not a speed demon, so I wouldn't know if it can outperform other cars in its class.

I have had Two concerns so far (currently we have 1395 miles on the vehicle).  One is a recall for the 24 valve engine.  It is to reprogram the engine computer (the engine could possibly backfire when started). Two is that our cruise control broke at 900 miles.  And, of course, it has taken the dealership multiple attempts and a special order part to fix the problem.

Take this for what it's worth, but I like the car.  More importantly, I like the company that was willing to stand behind it's previous product.  I find that to be rare nowadays.<br><br>
