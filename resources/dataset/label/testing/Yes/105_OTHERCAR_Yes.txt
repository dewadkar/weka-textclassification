            I have recently bought my third new vehicle from Suzuki. After purchasing the 2000 Grand Vitara, I upgrade to the 2001 XL7 and now I've decided to upgrade once more...

The 2003 XL7 is very similar to the 2001 which I had before except the newer version has a different interior and a little more horse power (there are a few other technical spec upgrades which I've left out). The interior upgrades are very stylish especially the front instrument panels and seat upholstery. However, these are minor changes for me and not why I purchased the new vehicle.

With the newer models, Suzuki now offers a 5 year, 100 000 km warranty (Canadian dealerships). US buyers should check their local dealerships for more accurate warranty numbers. Previously, Suzuki offered a 3 year, 80 000 km warranty so I'm pleased with the extra security. My 2001 had very little warranty work done but there were a few service calls I had to make which would have proved very costly if not covered. The 5 year warranty gives buyers an extra sense of ease. 

I've also been fortunate to have an exceptional service center with the dealership I've bought from. In my area, there are 2 Suzuki dealerships and one of them wasn't customer driven but the other is newer and more interested in pleasing their clientele. I know that in some cities, Suzuki has small dealerships but all you need to do is bring in your current car with some routine service work to get a feel for their customer treatment. I find that servicing requires just as much research as buying, and now consumer guide can measure each individual dealership service center. 

Some other tidbits that are very pleasing about the 2003 model and prior models include:

1. 2 Wheel drive and 4 wheel drive easy shift. 
2. The timing belt is a chain so it usually lasts as long as the engine so there is no need to change it at 90 000 km
3. 5 and 7 seat models are available. The 5 seat model is a standard transmision which I've opted for in my 2003. I found that the 2 seats in the very back were seldom used and too small in the first place. They are great for tinier bodies but not for adults. The five seat model slightly gives more room in the back for storage while the 7 seat model does allow you to fold down the seats but the storage space is reduced.
4. Mileage is average but better than most SUV's. I can get about 450-500 kms on one tank.
5. A solid truck style frame is used unlike other SUVS which use the same frame as most of their car models.

Overall, the XL7 is a formidable investment and since Suzuki offers a competitive price, this adds to its desiribility as a solid medium sized SUV.
