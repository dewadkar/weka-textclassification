            There comes a time when all good Dad's need to consider a family car. I'd driven three Saabs, and recently drove a '95 Taurus SHO for three years, when my wife declared she wouldn't drive a manual anymore. The SHO wasn't quite the same as the Saab, especially in the mountains. Handling was similar enough, though, that the transition to a Taurus was easy. 

Selling the SHO on the web unexpectedly fast, I needed another car in a hurry. Also using the web, I found a low mileage (29500) '95 Taurus Wagon at a local dealer, and went right over. I bought the car on the spot. That was several months ago.

The three boys love the rear facing seat, though only two can sit there at a time. The car isn't quite as tight in handling as the SHO was, but then the extra length must have SOME effect! The engine starts easily even on cold Colorado mornings, and the transmission is smooth.

The rear window latch is a problem, as the window needs to be nearly slammed before it will close. The fuel door latch operated from the driver seat is broken, and the middle seat squeeks a bit. Acceleration is adequate, but then I was used to the SHO.

I expect the fuel pump to go out eventually, as it did on a Sable wagon I owned for three years. I'm already saving the nearly $300 that will cost. But I'm pleased so far that this used car, from a rental agency (often the hardest environment for a car, as the drivers all have different habits) has stood up well.

The wagon was rated on someone's list as the least stolen car in America. A sexy machine it is not, but versatile, it is, and for the money, very useful for family and camping. Highly recommended for those years when the kids are young and saving dollars for college a priority.
