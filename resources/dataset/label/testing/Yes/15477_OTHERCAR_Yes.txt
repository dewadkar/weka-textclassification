            The school I work at bought 3 of the FD83s in February 2000 and 3 FD88s in April 2000. They get daily use by students (who treat the equipment horribly). Not one of the cameras has had a single problem. Prior to using these cameras, we used Olympus and Kodak, which had daily problems and only lasted a few months before being replaced.

The rechargeable batteries are great. In the past we've had to use AA batteries which usually lasted no longer than 30 minutes. The rechargeables on these cameras last several hours usually and recharge very quickly.

Being able to use a floppy is great. We don't have to deal with installing software and cables to get our images into the computer. The only problem with this is that if you want to take high resolution images, you can only store a few on each disk.

We also love the video feature, although we haven't found it very useful yet. It's just fun to play around with.<br><br>
