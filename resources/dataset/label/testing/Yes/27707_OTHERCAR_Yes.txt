                 About a year ago I decided it was time for me to get a sports car.  I felt that burning need for speed but also had a little less cash than I was hoping for.  I began researching high performance cars on the internet.  Everywhere I looked, Mitsubishi Eclipse kept popping up.  Looking more closely into the different models the Eclipse comes in, the gs-t and gsx were the two that caught my eye.  
     Now it was time to test drive!  I went to a local dealership and compared a 1996 gs-t with a 1996 gsx.  In head to head competition, on dry pavement, the gs-t wins hands down.  There is much to be said about the all-wheel drive of the gsx however it suffers a loss of horsepower in the conversion from the standard front wheel drive.  That test made up my mind, and boy am I pleased.  I decided to purchase a 1996 Eclipse gs-t.  It is red with power everything, moon roof, and spoiler.  The car had 46,000 miles on it and I got it for $12,000.  This car is absolutely amazing.  I can even beat my friend in his 1999 BMW 6-cyl Z-3 roadster.  If you are in the market for a good-looking, economical sports car, then the Eclipse gs-t is the one for you! <br><br>
