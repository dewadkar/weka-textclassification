                 This car could easily be considered a luxury sedan, based upon the quality of manufacture and the "goodies" that are standard to the marque.  The most unusual of these is the right-side mirror that, if the driver desires, moves in and down, enabling you to see the curb by the right rear wheel when you are parallel parking.  The outside mirrors can be "pulled in" for car washes and narrow garages.  The driver's-seat memory function handles 3 drivers, and two memories can be programmed to adjust the seat with the "remote control" car keys.
     The interior finish is flawless; high-quality leather is used on the seats, and the wood...not plastic...trim exudes class and comfort.  The auto-dimming mirror works amazingly effectively at night, but the back-window shade is a tad over-the-top.  Perhaps if I ever need to use it, I'll appreciate it more.
     The sunroof control is the most logical I've seen; a knob you turn to open or tilt, with infinite adjustment instead of just open/closed, using the usual toggle switch.
     Although another review of a new Passat mentioned a trunk release inside the trunk, I can't find it on mine.  Living in NJ, perhaps I should look more carefully.
     The Tiptronic transmission is great, and I've admired it on Porsches for the past three decades.  It takes some getting used to, but its use lends a sporty feel to the drive, and supposedly can increase mileage figures.
     The cupholders for the front seat are permanently built in, and will probably become dust and dirt catchers, since the two recessed openings are not easily cleaned, although they hold any sized cup quite securely.
     The cruise control is quite well-designed.  It can be fully operated from the steering wheel controls, with the on/off switch on the turn signal stalk being used less, since you can leave it ON, and just use the wheel controls.
     Radio controls on the steering wheel work well and are simple and "easy to learn."  The tape and radio controls on the dashboard are a bit complex, but don't have to be touched frequently.
     Safety features are the best.  The new head-protector curtains are a definite plus, for both front and back seat occupants.  Seat belts are easy to use, and adequately adjustable for height of front-seat occupants.
     The centered radio antenna, above the back window, seems odd, but is effective, with no antenna motors to burn out, yet it's flexible enough to tolerate car washes.
     Courtesy lights are abundant, although it's a stretch to consider the back seat lights suitable for reading.  The trunk light is non-switchable; not a plus.  
     The pseudo-first aid kit in the trunk is amusing.  It's actually pre-wired to hold a CD changer, with a couple of shelves left over for storage of first aid supplies.
     I believe the GLX is twin to an Audi A6.  I've parked beside one of them, and compared the dashboards...they were identical, it appeared.
     My first VW was a 59 bug; the second was a '60 Karmann-Ghia, so this is my third, and the quality is much higher.  I've also owned a Porsche and a M-B in the past, and I think I have as much quality in this car as in the M-B.
     I've only owned this car for five weeks, so haven't a clue as to what it's reliability will be.  Stay tuned.
