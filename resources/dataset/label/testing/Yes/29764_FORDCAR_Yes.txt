            In the market for an SUV?  Well...who isn't?  I got one for you.  It's called the Ford Explorer.  I have a black 1997 Ford Explorer and I love it.  This vehicle was given to me as present for graduation.  I was skeptical at first, thinking that this was only due to the SUV craze that had gripped the nation.  But when I started driving this car, I fell in love.  Because of the elevation, the Explorer allows you to see the road, thus averting things you normally couldn't see in a lower car.  To drive this car, you feel like you're in command of the road.  When you hit the bumps or potholes, the Explorer absorbs it and takes the punishment without falling apart.  A roomy interior gives you something to look forward to when you're stuck in traffic.  The Explorer isn't too big...However, there is one thing I don't like.  Since this is an SUV, its response time isn't like a sports cars'.  Elevation means caution.  If you like to drive fast, then this car isn't for you.  Yes, you do have to brake to at least 20 mph to turn or you'll pretty much flip.  However, if you like to have a presence on the road, if you like to see the road, and you like value, the Ford Explorer is for you.<br><br>
