            A few months ago we had a need to replace or older Ford Escort, and we stumbled on to the Ford Focus, what a find!.  This little package has it all and is a great, fun drive.  The attention to detail from Ford is very much enjoyed, the car handles great and the power is very good.  The impressive feature is the room in the car.

It does not feel like a small car.  I have two teenage children and they have ridden in the back for some road trips.  Each time they have fallen asleep in the comfortable back seats.  The front seats are just amazing!  I also like the fact the Ford has used a lot of recycled products in this car, you will not believe the fact that the seats are made from recycled jeans!

I was hoping that Ford would bring this car in under $12,000.00 but didn't.  You can find a nicely equipped Ford Focus at $15,000.00 and be very pleased with it.  I would encourage anyone to drive this car you will fall in love with it!  <br><br>
