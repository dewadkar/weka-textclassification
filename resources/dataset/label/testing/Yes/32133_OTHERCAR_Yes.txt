            I live in Venezuela. Our streets and highways are partially in very bad conditions. So you need a well build strong car which supports heavy bumps and difficult driving conditions. I decided for a Daewoo Lanos, since many taxi drivers in our cities use Daewoo cars, mainly the models Cielo and Lanos. Their reasons are a long lifetime and very few visits to the repair shops.
I got my new Lanos a month ago and love the soft handling and comfortable seating, even on large intercity trips on regular to bad road conditions. I also own the little Daewoo Matiz and both cars are perfectly build with nothing to claim on warranty. I like the responsive engine and perfect acting brakes of the Lanos.
In our country the Lanos is not equipped with airbags and they donï¿½t come with ABS, even not at extra price. With these options included the Lanos in my opinion would be an excellent little car.<br><br>
