            When I was shopping for an SUV, i tried the Explorer and several others. I liked the Explorer, but it rode really hard. Then I came across the Mercury Mountaineer. it looks much like the Explorer, and after getting info about it, it is made by Ford and is basically an Explorer but with a better suspension and some other features.

I love the car(or SUV), it rides great for an SUV, it has a lot of options to choose from, and it is AWD(all-wheel drive). it handles well, looks good, and has a V8 engine which is good for towing anything.

The only con I've noticed about the car is the mpg, but then again it is an SUV and you have to expect it to burn gas. Other than that, it's quite a lovely car. The stereo is just awesome, the moonroof is fantastic for summer drives, and the interior is very comfortable. Along with many cup holder, rear vents, and rear radio controls, this SUV is well worth the money.<br><br>
