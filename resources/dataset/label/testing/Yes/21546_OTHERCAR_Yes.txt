            Don't get me wrong, the Canon Elph S200 is an awesome camera: it's super-compact, it takes great photos (clear up to an 8x10), it's simple to use, it takes decent MPEGs, and it looks way cool.

This is the perfect camera for anyone taking simple snapshots of friends and family.  I bought this before my first child was born so that I had a digital camera during labor and delivery and could send out those first pictures of the baby over the internet with a quickness.  It worked out great.  The pictures were very clear, even in low light.  I'm not sure why there are complaints on the flash quality, we had absolutely no problems in that area.  Even when I couldn't see the baby on the LCD screen because the room was too dark, the flash was definitely bright enough to take a great picture.

I also love that it uses the Compact Flash card rather than a Smart card.  Since more and more things are using a Flash card rather than the Smart Media, I am able to swap my IPAQ's card with my Elph's and always have a spare.

The battery-life has also not been an issue for us.  As you can imagine, being new parents we take tons of pictures.  I typically take about ten pictures a day and maybe three movies a week.  I do not charge my battery more than once a week, if that.  So, in other words, the battery lasts for quite some time.  I also love the fact that the battery is rechargeable (and it does quickly recharge (about an hour and a half after the first charge), because we would be going through a million batteries otherwise!

The camera is also sturdy and durable.  I take this camera with me every where and it usually travels by diaper bag so it gets thrashed around quite a bit. It also has gotten occasionally 'misted' or gotten some baby finger goop on it, but it cleans up like a champ and  I have not had one problem with it working improperly or being damaged.

I have a few complaints about the camera :  

I wish the zoom was better.  I know that the digital zoom can get right up close, but you lose so much resolution when you print that I never go past the 2.0 optical zoom.  Usually, that's close enough.  But now that my little one is walking, it is hard to get a nice, close-up shot when he's across the room.  There is lens adapter so no additional lenses can be attached.  

There is no battery life indicator.  This makes it difficult to determine when the battery needs charging, until it gets too late.  

I wish it came with a carrying case.  Canon offers a camera case specifically for the Elph, but from what I can remember, they were a bit pricey.  We opted for getting a generic holder, which works great, but it would have been nice if it came with the package when we bought the camera.

The shutterlag can get a bit annoying.  If you always push the shutter halfway down so that the camera has ample time to focus and what not, then the shutter, obviously, won't lag.  But if you want to take a quick photo to capture that perfect moment, you may just miss it because the camera took too long to do its business.  This is not terribly pronounced, but it does happen.  

The 16MB compact flash card is a joke.  Considering how inexpensive flash cards have become, you would think Canon would spring for a 128 or something.  

I really do like this camera, it certainly serves its purpose at the moment.  Eventually it will be traded in for a camera that accepts additional lenses and, of course, has more megapixels.
