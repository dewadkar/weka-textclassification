            If you want a safe, reliable automobile that you can feel good about putting your children in, this is the car for you.  

4 years ago, I was traveling back home from school when my windshield wipers failed.  I continued to drive.  Granted, not the smartest move, but I was close to home.  Nevertheless, I was going about 50 miles an hour (I am starting to realize more now than ever how stupid I was), when I rear-ended a woman in a station wagon as she was stopped in preparation to make a turn.  I don't remember much after that.  Except the car kept running despite being almost totally demolished, and I was alive without a scratch on me. 

Mark my words, had I been in a car made by some lackluster manufacturer, I would have been severely injured or even killed.  Sweden makes a darn good car, and I recommend that if you are truly concerned with safety of yourself or your children, invest in a Volvo.  Great for a new driver.  Everyone gets into accidents, have it be in this vehicle.  <br><br>
