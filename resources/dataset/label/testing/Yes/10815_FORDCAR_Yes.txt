            <i><b>The following review is a greatly revised version of a review dated 12-20-99</b></i>

<b>What I Love</b>
I was a picky consumer when it came to buying my minivan.  Growing up around motorcycle racetracks and hot rod shows, I am what many would call a female &quot;motorhead&quot;--meaning I love the sound of a powerful hot rod engine.  

After test-driving the other makes of minivans in this particular class I was unhappy.  They lacked comfort, power, and felt clunky when I drove them.  

Then I discovered the 1998 Ford Windstar.  What a comfy ride!  It's been on long trips (6+ hours) and very often the same driver does the entire 6 hour leg.  The passenger seats are built to be comfortable for adults (not all minivans can tout this), and I've comfortably taken 5-7 adults on roadtrips with no complaints.  

I don't have children of my own, but I've had friends and family easily install and remove a baby carseat within minutes.  

The V-6 engine is great on hills even with cargo and passengers weighing it down.  The cruise control is smooth and consistent on hills as well (i.e., the &quot;Grapevine&quot; coming in or out of L.A.).  I took it to Mt. Lassen National Park with 4 adults and gear in it, and it drove like a champ in the high altitude (8,000+ feet above sea-level).  

The Windstar's body is well-built vehicle and insulated superbly from road noise and drives so smoothly you'd think you were in a luxury sedan.  But how many luxury sedans can you fit an oak bookcase in without removing seats or leaving doors open? 

<b>What I Hate</b>
For the first 41,000 miles the Windstar ran great when maintained regularly with oil changes.  The gas mileage wasn't anything to brag about though (17-18 mpg city/23 mpg highway).  

At around 35,000 miles, our Windstar's power steering pump went from silent to matching the decibels of an air-raid siren when reved up.  According to my mechanic, this model apparently has an inherently noisy power steering pump that often won't manifest itself until around 35,000 miles.  Still under warranty, the power steering pump was replaced twice in order to alleviate the noise.  However, the final pump hasn't been as quiet as the original was.  

About 5,000 miles later, at around 40,000 miles, I started up the vehicle one afternoon to a laboring idle, lurching, and shuddering.  It barely made it home.  Upon inspection, our mechanic found that the head gasket was blown and the 1st and 4th cylinders weren't holding any pressure.  Bad news!!!  This vehicle isn't supposed to need a tune-up until 100,000 miles, so this was a big shock.  We had it towed to the local dealership for service under Ford Motor Company's Customer Care plan.

After replacing the head gasket, the dealership's mechanic gave it back with a clean bill of health.  Less than 24 hours later, the problem was back.  We took it back in and the engine was torn down again, had all its lifters replaced, and then was reassembled.  Upon test-driving the vehicle, the technician still heard trouble.  So, as I write this review the engine is being torn down for a third time.  

I must admit that Ford Motor Company has been very accommodating through all of this.  Even though the vehicle was out of warranty, Ford has paid for all repairs under the provision that we bought a retroactive warranty extension (to the tune of $495).  The customer care staff has been extremely helpful in documenting the entire process and assuring us that they will make everything right.  In the meantime, I am driving a rental car from Enterprise paid in full by Ford.  It's a Ford Taurus station wagon (don't like it--but that's another review).
