            We needed a second car, so we started looking at all the different cars.
We bought a Mercury Sable and glad we did.  The car is great and runs like a dream.  It has a smooth ride and very quite.  You have to be very careful in the used car line.  There are cars out there that are high dollar and poor shape.  We are very happy with the Sable and well worth the money we paid for it.  The car handles the road great and stops on a dime.  I would tell anyone that is looking for a good used car to check out a Mercury Sable.  The road noise is alittle loud but I am going to take that in to have that checked out.  It shouldn't have road noise like that.  The trunk space is huge.  There is plenty of room to put a large amount of cargo.  I would tell anyone this is a great car to get.  The interior is plush and very comfortable.  I have electric seats a automatic trunk and gas door and rear window defroster.  Lots of leg room in this car.  My husband is 6'2 and has plenty of leg room.  This is a four door so there is alot of room inside even for the family.  There are electric windows and power locks that makes it easy to  control.<br><br>
