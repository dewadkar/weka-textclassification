            The 1990 Mazda Protege is one of the best cars that money can buy.  I have a '90 Protege LX that my father bought in 1990 (his 40th birthday present) that he recently handed over to me.  This car is a dream!  It is super easy to drive, and it can perform!  

It only has a 125hp 4 cylinder engine, but it makes up for that with a very light curb weight and very competitive handling.  The manual transmission that is in the car is very smooth, and the clutch is very crisp (once you get used to it; it takes a bit of practice to get it right.)  It accelerates very well for a small engine, and the 7000rpm redline makes it a very fun car to play with.  The 4-cyl engine may be small, but under heavy acceleration it sounds pretty good!  

The power steering is very responsive and offers great feedback at higher speeds (40mph+) but can be a bit light at freeway speeds (65mph+.)  The brakes are a bit touchy at first, but are excellent once you get a feel for them.  I would opt for the ABS, though, as the wheels tend to lock in the rain when you slam on the brakes (as most cars do.)  The AC and heater are extremely responsive; they both work perfectly after about 30 seconds of engine warm-up.  The seats in front are great!  They are very comfortable, and offer good support.  They are also easy to adjust.  The back seat is comfortable if you fit. 

The only problems with this car is 1) the back seat is very cramped for adults and 2) the road noise can be a little loud at high speeds, but that is nothing that a good stereo won't fix :-)  The car gets GREAT fuel mileage at any speed (I average about 28mpg; it's even better on the highway; I do most of my driving around town.)  

It is trouble free.  In the 11 years that my dad had it, the radiator was the only thing that failed.  It was a pricey fix, but we've only had to do it once.  The brakes have only been replaced once, the original clutch still works great, nothing has leaked, and the original struts and springs are still in good shape after 128,000 miles.  This is a great car!  

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a car for themselves, because it is very sporty, it handles excellently, and is a babe magnet (at least for me!)  It may not be a Ferrari, but for being a tiny fraction of the cost, it definitely holds its own!
