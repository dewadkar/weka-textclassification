            With a pending divorce looming (fall 2001), I first bought my 2000 Kia Sephia by walking into a multi-make car dealership stating, "I need something that I can fit three kids and a grocery store run in, is good on gas, and payments of only about $200.  What'cha got?"  I was shown two Sephia's and a Chevy Cavalier.  I chose one of the Kia's; a little 5-speed white program car.  I must say, it is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.

This little baby is awesome on gas, is quite the little "tank" as I had driven it on some pretty rough terrain while I was looking for real estate for sale.  I have yet to have a maintenance issue - I did replace the tires at 55K or 60K, and as of this writing, it has 83K miles on it.  I suppose I really should have one of the 30K or 60k maintenance things done on it, but haven't gotten around to it... though I do take it in fairly regularly for its oil changes at every 5k along with the tire rotation - it's easier to remember that way... And it is very forgiving toward a 16-ear old learning to drive a stick.

It has a fabulous turning radius, and it fits in some of the smallest parking spaces.  It is wonderfully roomy for a little car...I can seat all three of my teen-age kids in the back.. and I have set back there as well before I purchased it to see if it would be roomy enough for someone my height (5'7").  It has great visual ability through the rear-view mirror.  The trunk is very roomy, and holds a lot more than it looks like it can.  The back seats fold down to allow even more room - we have put an antique 42" dia. spinning wheel in there, and have recently hauled 5' mailbox posts and post hole diggers.

The seat fabric and interior is easy to wash with a damp cloth (good for mocha-related incidents during rush hour).  It is very comfy during 6-hour road trips we have taken.

I love this little work-horse of car... it is going to be the mode of transportation for my 16-year old, also.
