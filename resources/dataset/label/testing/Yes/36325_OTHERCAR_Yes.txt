            UPDATE:  I've had my Z28 for a little over a year now and have put over 20K miles on it.  It is VERY addictive to drive.  So far, I've had no problems whatsoever with it.  I will update the review if I have any problems.  My past experience with Camaros makes me feel confident that I will not have any problems with this one.  

 I blow past mustangs (and just about everything else I encounter) with the greatest of ease.  This car has the all-aluminum LS1 which is a Corvette engine.  Some of these Camaros (maybe as many as a quarter of them) were actually manufactured with the LS6 which is a slightly better engine.  This car has been very reliable so far and I have had no mechanical problems.  My problems with the car are small, but worth mentioning:

1) is the skip shift.  This is a rev limiter that locks you out of certain gears at certain points if you have a stick shift.  This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen on a car.  They basically intentionally ruined the stick shift.  Luckily, for about $30 you can buy a part to fix this problem.  This can be purchased at slponline.com or other performance parts sites.  I've been locked out of 3rd gear at crucial moments.  2nd gear can also be quite sticky.  I think they must have been hitting the crack pipe on the day some "genius" came up with this idea.  Another option is to reprogram the chip with a reprogrammer that costs about $250.  In spite of using the reprogrammer and skip shift eliminator, I still finding hitting 3rd is a little sticky sometimes.    

2)  trunk lock problem.  This trunk doesn't float down and lock into position like it did with my 92 Camaro.  Instead you have to slam to trunk.  It doesn't open automatically either.  The bean counters must have figured they could save a few bucks by downgrading this.  I really miss the way the '92 trunk would float down and lock.  This seems trivial, but if you have to put stuff in the trunk a lot, it's annoying, especially after getting used to older Camaro trunks.  I thought everything should be improved, not down-graded.  

3)  cheap speakers.  My speakers blew out shortly after buying the car.  I don't listen to music that loud either.  They will have to be replaced.  Supposedly there are 8 speakers in the Monsoon system, but I've only found 6.  The sound system overall is poor, even with the upgrade to the Monsoon.  

4)  annoying squeak.  There is any annoying squeak where the metal latch that holds the back seat in the upright position rubs against the pin.  I solved this by putting a small piece of cloth between the latch and the pin.  There are other squeaking and creaking sounds coming from the pedals.  Don't expect Porsche build-quality.

5) insurance costs.  If you have 1 or 2 points on your record, expect to pay a lot for insurance, at least in California.  I recommend calling your insurance company BEFORE you buy this car and finding out what the rates are going to be.  You can cut it down a little bit by not getting the SS package and just adding your own exhaust and SS hood if you like.  

Other than these small problems, the car is everything I expected and more.  There is a reason the CHP uses these as chase cars.  Some minor improvements I plan to make are adding a Billy Boat  or Borla exhaust system, Hooker headers and SLP hood (cheaper than an SS hood).  I would buy this car again in a second and have NO regrets about getting it!
