            I purchased a 1995 Galant about a year ago, and I wish I had stuck to my original idea to purchase a Toyota Camry. This car is like a toy, a very delicate toy! It has no pickup, takes forever to accelerate. I am going to have to bring it in to have the transmission checked because when I am going downhill, the gears seem to suddenly shift and it feels like it loses power. After reading some of the write-ups on epinions, it seems that transmission problems are common in the Galant. The car also has a lot of squeaks and noises.

The car is nice looking. Small and silver, and it has a sleek little look. The inside is not roomy, although the seats are comfortable.

I had purchased a Toyota Camry in 1990 and just got rid of it in 1999. Even with close to 200,000, it ran better than this Galant. This car might be good for someone who doesn't have much driving experience, and therefore, doesn't expect too much performance. As for me, it is a disappointment.

If you are looking for a solid car, I can tell you that this is not the car for you.<br><br>
