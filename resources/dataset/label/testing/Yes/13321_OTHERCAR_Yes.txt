            First things first...I'm writing about an ENGLISH-spec Forester with a standard non-turbo 2.0 litre engine. I have the SP package which adds a huge sunroof...aircon...heated front seats...and a singleplay CD/cassette/radio - all of which are nonstandard items. I upgraded the CD to a 6-disc unit and a dedicated indash cassette/radio.

As a broadcaster in England, reliability for me is THE single biggest factor in choosing a car. I simply can't miss a live broadcast on the grounds that the car doesn't work and I'm stranded somewhere. I need to know I can get in...start the engine and go from A to B without fuss or problems. And I get this from the Forester. It's the second I've owned and the first time in 35 years of car-owning that I've bought the same car twice in a row. I can find no major fault with it.

It'll cruise happily at 80mph and I've had it up to 110mph (legally on a German autobahn !). With a mixture of town and rural driving, I get around 30mpg (are English gallons a little bigger than US ones ?). A lot of European-spec SUVs - and I'm thinking Nissan, Honda and Toyota here - come with a standard 1.8 engine. The Forester's 2.0 gives it a significant edge over the opposition. It move smoothly through the manual gearshift and handles extremely well - better in fact than some standard cars I've owned. 

It's very comfortable to drive. My back's been tortured in the past by seats that can't cope with 3-4 hr journeys. The Forester provides no problems in this area at all and the heated seats are great on cold mornings - and for easing a bit of stiffness after a round of golf. 

Back seats look perhaps a little cramped with both front seats right back, but I've carried 5 on short trips with no problems

The build quality is great. High quality paint and interior finish that lasts. I should add at this point that on my latest Subaru, the driver's remote control for the rear windows failed after abt 10k miles. This was replaced without fuss under warranty. And that's the ONLY thing that's EVER gone wrong in about 80,000 miles in 2 cars.

Load space is good. There are several little hidey-holes holes for small items and the trunk space is large enough to hold a big load without folding down the back seats. I have a load cover - do US models have this ? With the back seats folded down, I've moved huge plants...6 foot pieces of timber - and 120-odd bottles of wine from a recent trip to France.

Standard tyres are Bridgestone Duellers. I get about 25,000 miles from them.

As I've said, regular road travel is very good. Offroad clearly won't be as impressive as some specialist vehicles, but even in the rural area I live in, with lots of single track dirt roads, I've never had much of a problem. I feel pretty safe at throwing the Forester through tight curves and corners knowing it's not going to spring any nasty surprises on me. It does givce you great confidence and peace of mind. The power steering is light and responsive - especially at high speeds - but not so light and wooly that you get no feedback from the road surface. and  Brakes are sharp and the ABS system works well. Headlights are good. Foglights are so-so. All-round visibility is good. Aircon and heating cope with fine with the British climate that can offer all four seasons in a single day !

I'll always be a small SUV driver - I've yet to drive anything that remotely rivals the Forester and I guess that after number 2, i'll probably buy number 3. The 2003 model in England comes in a really smart very dark green !
