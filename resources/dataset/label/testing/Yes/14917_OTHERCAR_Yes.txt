            I like this camera.  Better than any digital for the money.  It's easy to use and fun.  Simply put a standard 3.5&quot; floppy disk and start snapping photos.  After you have taken 30-50 shots, put them on the computer.  If you do not want to use up hard space, store the disk in a drawer.  Going on vacation?  Nothing better.  No extra cost for developing the 100+ photos you will be taking.  Using a different digital camera?  That is too bad because now that you have filled up your disk card what are you going to do.  Unless you have a computer handy to download all the photos you will have to buy another disk card.  What is the big deal, you ask?  Each disk card runs between $30 and up, depending on the size and are you live.  Thinking about a digital or want to upgrade, check this one out before you buy.  The only down fall I have found with this camera is that the max dpi for taking photos is 200.  Still get very good quality photos however.<br><br>
