            I'd always driven small cars but when my daughter was born I decided I needed something with a lot more room.  I settled on the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo because it's not ridiculously massive like a lot of SUV's and I really like the body style.  The seats are comfy and I love the way it drives.  This is a fun vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone thinking about getting an SUV, but there are a couple of minor problems to watch out for.  First of all, I had to have the brakes serviced at 17,000 miles and was told some Jeeps have defective calipers that I may need to replace eventually.  Also, the windshield wipers are pretty cheap, so you'll probably want to replace those right away.
