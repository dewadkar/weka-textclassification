              A Mercedes sport utility is kind of an oxymoron don't you think?  My first image of a Mercedes owner is someone who is slightly older, conservative, married and not much of an outdoors kind of person.  So what was Mercedes thinking when they decided to make the M-class?  They were thinking of all the older, conservative and married people who THINK they are outdoors type of people.  That's what they were thinking!  Odds are, the person buying the M-class will never really take their SUV into any serious type of off-road terrain.  SO..... if you ARE gonna be doing some serious off-road traveling, do not read any further.  Go look at the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The Cherokee has excellent off-road capabilities for pretty much the same price.  End of story.

  Now for the rest of you, you want to know what the M-class is all about.  Here's a brief list of a few advantages and disadvantages.

Advantages:

1. Roomy interior.  You can fit three average size adults in the back seat with no problem.  Plenty of room in back for all their gear too!

2. Good power.  There's not much difference between the V6 or V8 in everyday driving situations.  The V8 has 
more torque which gives it that extra &quot;umph&quot; off the line, but you'll be paying a higher penalty in the gas mileage department.  For model year 2000, there's also the ML55 which has 340 horsepower!  Mercedes claims the ML55 is the &quot;fastest SUV on earth&quot;.

3. Safety.  The M-class and Lexus RX300 were ranked as the two of the safest SUVs on the market according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (www.highwaysafety.org).  This is definitely something to think about.

4. Handling.  The M-class has four wheel independent suspension.  This translates into a very smooth ride and excellent handling capabilities.  In other words, this SUV drives more like a car than a truck.  Furthermore, the M-class has an excellent, if not the best, turning radius thanks to the differentials in its permanent 4WD set-up.  Take another SUV without permanent 4WD, put it in 4WD and try to turn.  It's not a pretty sight!

5. Semi-off road capabilities:  Like the ads say, this car can go even when only one wheel has traction!  Going through mud or snow is definitely not a problem for this car.  Just don't start asking it to climb over large boulders or anything and you'll be fine.

Disadvantages:

1.  Price.  Plenty of other SUVs on the market which are cheaper.  The ML55 is $60K plus!

2.  Looks: This thing looks like a mini-van from the back!  It needs a more rugged look I think.

3.  Gas:  What's this about a premium fuel requirement?  Yikes.

4.  Lack of serious off-roading capabilities.
