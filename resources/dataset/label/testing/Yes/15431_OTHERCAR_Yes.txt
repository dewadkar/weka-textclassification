            I first saw this camera two years ago at a New Years Eve party.  I wanted one then, but I reasoned, if I waited a year or so the price would go down and instead of $800 I'd pay $500 or less.  But I just couldn't wait.  I went out and got one just a few months later and I'm glad I did.  This camera has been a lot of fun.

It's light weight and durable.  I've carried it in my purse, in a diaper bag, stuffed into my luggage with my clothes.  It's very easy to use.

For digital pictures, there are two modes: regular or email.  This is a nice feature because it reduces the size of the image for you automatically so you can email the picture right away without cropping or reducing it.  It also has a movie mode which will produce short mpeg clips.  This is fun for parties and groups.  Take a short movie clip with your camera and then play it back (complete with sound), the entire room will gather around saying &quot;Wow!&quot; and &quot;That's cool!&quot;

My favorite feature, as compared to other digital cameras I've seen, is the floppy disk port on the camera itself.  You can format a disk with it, fill the disk with pictures, and then make a copy onto another disk if you want, all with the camera itself.  Other digital cameras have some sort of converter that you must use to plug into the pc to get the pictures from the camera to the hard drive.  With this camera, it's as simple as shuffling the disk from the camera to the floppy drive.

This camera helped me to have an online internet baby shower.  The online guests ordered their gifts and had them delivered.  As the gifts were opened, I was able to take photos and post them immediately for the online guests to see and comment on, making them all a part of the festivities.<br><br>
