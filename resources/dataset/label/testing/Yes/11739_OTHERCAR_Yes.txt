            The 2001 Honda CRV is a wonderful sports utility vehicle.  We recently took the CRV on vacation with four people in the vehicle.  We enjoyed a smooth ride with minimal noise.  The fronts seats are quite comfortable with spacious head and leg room.  The back seat is a bit uncomfortable due because the back of the seat is straight up and down.  The air conditioning keeps passengers cool and the radio has rather good sound quality with speakers located in the front and back of the CRV.  There is ample storage available in the back that is easily accessed by opening the window which pops up or the door which swings open.  There is even a picnic table located under the carpet that has legs that open up, very cool if you ask me!  The engine has plenty of power for a small SUV and the automatic transmission has good pick up when shifting gears or going uphill.  The Honda CRV is a cute vehicle and is available in several eye-catching colors.  I suggest the cherry red CRV!  I'd recommend the Honda CRV to families on a budget who are looking for an SUV with space and versatility.
