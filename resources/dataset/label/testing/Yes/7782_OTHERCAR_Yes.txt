            First, for the record, the Acura 2003 TL and 2002 TL are practically the same.  Second, the Acura TL is not a luxury car.  It is a near-luxury car.  Many of the comparisons I've seen, both good and bad, are being made against actual luxury cars.

A lot of cars, even luxury cars, are taking short cuts on the interior in terms of quality and materials used these days.  Out of all the cars in the 25000-35000 price range, I found the most well fitting and stable interior was in the Acura TL.  Even in luxury name brand vehicles (including some very highly regarded European makes) I found inferior quality interiors that just didn't feel solid.  Last year, I sat in friend's near-new vehicle with the Mercedes emblem on it, and thought I was in a Hyundai before I notice the emblem on the steering wheel.  d'oh

Interior comfort is above average.  Rear seats are actually comfortable, and easily seat three adults with no complaints.  

There are lots of items that come standard on the TL that you have to pay for in any other car in any class.  These items may not be up to par with similar offering in luxury cars (such as 2-setting seat heaters instead of 3-setting), but the luxury cars which these are compared to are 5000-10000 more base with an additional mark-up on top of that for these items.  The Cadillac CTS is a nice car that kinda competes with the TL with nearly the same base price, but once you add all the same options that are standard on the TL, it's price also pushes the 40000 mark.  

A minus for me is the dated exterior styling.  It resembles American sedans from the late 80's.  It is a nice look, but just dated.  

Apparently, the chassis is "inferior".  I haven't noticed any ill effects in this area.  My guess most drivers never will either.  Something the sports car enthusiast are trying to push as an issue.  Guess what...this isn't a sports car.

Finally, some of the interior controls are in a bad location behind the steering wheel.  The cruise-control on button is there, but the cruise-control functions are on the steering wheel itself.  This doesn't make much sense.  Also, the steering wheel stereo controls should have more functions.

Also, about pull-down rear seats:  I don't mind that it doesn't have them.  It makes the trunk more secure not to have them.  Currently, there's no practical way to get into the trunk from the inside or out once the manual lock is turned on, without the master key.

BTW, I'm having a good experience with my Acura dealership and salespeople so far.  

UPDATE (1/24/03)
I use my car for road trips and commuting.

Now that I've had my car for almost a year I can say more about it.  I've put almost 16,000 miles on it.  This is a great car for road trips and long distance driving.  It is very comfortable.  The car doesn't completely isolate you from the road, but for me, this is a good thing.  

The interior is very quiet.  I can't even hear the engine unless I've got it rev'ing over 5000 rpm.  Speaking of the engine, damn that thing is powerful.  With traction controls turned off, it is very responsible and quick.  Still very quick, with expected lag when traction control is on.  

Flaw: Sometimes the car occasionally has an interior creek while driving.  Sounds like a leather seating rubbing.  This may point to build quality issues.  

Also, I know this was a problem when I got the car: Horrible turn radius.  It normally isn't an issue, but every once in while, it does make maneuvering a chore.  

Mileage Status:
Overall average gas mileage: 22.45 mpg
Long Distance/Road Trip average gas mileage: 24.95
Commuter/City average gas mileage: 21.43
