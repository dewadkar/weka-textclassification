             This car may not be a luxury car (5 speed, no a/c, casette deck,2 door), but it is a reliable car.  The one main problem has been with the leaking window seals.  This has been going on since my mom purchased it brand new at the dealership.  The car has been "fixed" countless numbers of times at Toyota and we have also tried to re-seal the windows ourselves with every product on the market.  I think this is a problem solely with our car. 

 And I shouldn't say it has no good points as there are several features I do like about it including: seats that pull down to give more trunk space, retractable cup holders, excellent heater/defrost,great gas mileage, snazzy looking interior..etc..Most of my friends don't believe how old my car is due to it's  trendy looking facade.  If it weren't for some of the early 90's colours these babies come in, they would fit right in with the cars of today. 

 My mom sold me her Tercel for $1500 CDN about 4 years ago.  Due to the fact she kept up with regular services, and despite the fact that I often do not, this car runs great.  The last time I got an oil change was January 2003.  From April -October 2003 I was going to college full time, driving at least an 2 hours a day to and from college.  Even after all the abuse I put this car through she's given me more than I ever expected.

Back in August 2002 some idiot decided to drive by and throw a printer at my trunk.  It looks like someone drove into my car.  Now the trunk doesn't close properly, and mold grows inside my car.  I feel robbed of wonderful years I could have shared with my car.  In spite of the fact it has 300,000km's on it,I still drive it regularly and expect maybe even another 12 years with my car, I just wish I had been able to pay the $300 deductable to get the printer dent fixed, or even more that people weren't so jealous of my Tercel that they felt the need to throw computer parts at it.
