            I have owned Camrys for the last 10 years.  My first a 1991, which I think probably was the best built, out of the three I've owned.  Unfortunately, the conservative styling of the 1988-1991 model years could not compete to the larger more stylish, Maxima, and Accord of the time, particularly 90-91. 

 I never had a liking of the 92-96 Camry.  I did feel that it was overdone for the time.  Again, the timing wasn't right.  While Accord produced a more agile, sporty sedan, and Maxima an all around &quot;Euro&quot; style sedan, which stuns me to this day, why Maxima sales trail Camrys. 

 Alas, the 1997 Camry comes along.  A true spectacle to behold.  The fine lines, and total refinement, can easily rival an Italian designer.  My Camry again was a 4 cylinder, but unlike the '91, had power everything at a very attractive price.  I was very satisfied with the packages offered at the time and thrilled with the car. 

 On a routine oil change at the dealership one crispy January day in 1999, I ventured into the new care showroom, when there she was, a 1999 Camry LE V6.  I immediately asked to drive this car.  It had all the feature my '97 had but also, added CD, traction control, burlwood dash, power seats, VIP security/remote entry system, and did I mention THE V6!!!  The car drove like a dream.  The passing was a cinch, cornering a true performance, I love every aspect of that car. 

 I left the '97 in the service dept., and took the keys to my new Japanese Luxury Sedan.  This by the way started as a lease, but by the end of the first 6 months the car had 23,000 miles!  I wholeheartedly decided to switch to a purchase.  I guess I'm waiting till 2002 when the Camry is totally revamped.  The only options I decided against mainly because of the equipment packaging for 1999 was not too sensible on Toyota's part, were the sunroof, and leather.

  My vehicle still costs more than a top of the line V6 XLE.  That part doesn't make a great deal of sense.  It's all in the packaging, but since there are faults to be found in that, you're forced to get something you don't want, in lieu of something you do want! 

 I recommend this vehicle to just about anyone needing a safe, family sedan with some spunk.  I must add, though, if you want looks, performance, and all the buttons at no extra charge, check out the 2000 Maxima SE.  I actually kinda wish I'd have waited a year or so for it's debut.  <br><br>
