            When I first saw information of the new Aurora back in 1994,  I fell in love with its beauty.  Oldsmobile really did a great job presenting this car to the public.  I had to have one!  When the company I worked for gave us a choice of autos to lease, I chose the 1995 Aurora, loaded with Autobaun package and Moonroof, as well as all the other standard bells and whistles, of which there are many.

I drove and loved this car for the entire two year lease program.  Never any problems mechanically, just accolades from all that saw it.  I hated to turn it back to the dealer at the end of the lease.

I missed the car so much that I bought a used one coming off a lease with 30,000 miles on it.  This car was just as good as my first one and I decided to get a 1999 Aurora when my 1995 gets to the 100,000 mile mark.

I highly recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a luxury automobile with power and style, bells and whistles, and reliability.  The used Aurora is a bargain!  And now that GM has announced the end of the Oldsmobile product line, these Auroras could become highly sought after classics in years to come.<br><br>
