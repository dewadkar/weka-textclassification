            I have owned two Celicas during my life.  A 1985 Celica GT and I currently own a 1991 Toyota Celica GT 5 speed.  I recently drove a friends brand-new 2002 Celica GTS and came away throughly impressed.


EXTERIOR
First of all, this a great looking car.  It has a lean, muscular look to it, and I've even heard comparsions to Ferrari with its exterior styling.  My friends car was silver which looked great, and had 16 inch alloy wheels.  The front headlights on this car look great, they almost make the car look mean, which is pretty cool.  The only problem with the exterior is that it has a couple of bad blind spots that you need to be careful with during driving.


INTERIOR
The interior of the Celica is laid out like a fighter jet cockpit.  The gages are orange colored which makes them a little hard to read during the daytime, but they look awesome at night.  The GTS I drove had a great sounding, 6 speaker system that was designed very well.  The seats were black leather and very comfortable.  The hold most drivers in tight during spirited driving.  The car is a little lacking in headroom, but its a sports car, so that is expected.  The sunroof also as a little to do with that.  The back seat is very small however, and the sloping room makes for virtually no headroom for rear passengers.  But the Celica was not designed to carry rear passengers frequently, so this is understandable. 


ENGINE/DRIVE
The GTS comes standard with a 1.8, 180hp engine that is equiped with the Lexus derived VVTL-i system which opens the cams during high-rpms to get more air flow into the engine to increase power.  The only problem w/ this engine is the lack of low-end power.  The VVTL-i system doesn't kick in till about 6800RPM, and the redline approaches quickly after that, so you only get short spurts of speed from it.  My friends car had the optional automanual system which allows you to up and downshift the car via buttons mounted on the steering wheel.  The GTS comes standard w/ a close-shifting, 6 speed manual tranny, but the gears are so close, that some inexpirienced drivers have had problems finding the right gears and they have been blowing up their engines by accidentaly shifting into the wrong gear.  I would recommend the automanual to most people for the fact that it is easier to drive and the button shifting can still provide you with enough control over the engine like a true manual system.  Ok, enough about the engine, lets move the cars handling characterstics.  The Celica is an outstanding car from a pure handling perspective.  It has point and shoot capalities that are usually reserved for more expensive sports cars.  Also, the braking is outstanding, due to the cars low curb weight.  It actually stops just a few feet longer than a Ferrari!  


VALUE/PRICE
The Celica starts around 16000 for the base GT model and tops out around 24000 for a fully-loaded GTS.  Toyota makes very high-quaility cars that run forever, so you would not be making a mistake to buy from them.  The Celica is a 2 door coupe, so you probably wouldn't want one if you have a family you need to transport, but it is a fun car to own and drive.  I highly recommend it for its value and reliability repuation.
