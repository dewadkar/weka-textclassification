            I am thoroughly impressed with my 1996 Ford Aerostar!  I bought this van new in Dec 96 and have driven it over 278,000 miles as of Nov 2001.  It is not as stylish (inside and out) as the Windstar and vans made by other auto makers, but it's long range reliability has been great! In fact, three years after I bought my van I was pleasantly surprised to find Consumer Report's rated the '96 Aerostar very highly.  This van has the 3.0 litre engine which has been one of the best engines ever made.  The engine and drive train has been virtually trouble-free.  Gas mileage has averaged 20 MPG.  The '96 Aerostar sold very well so parts are easy and reasonable to obtain. I found in-shop maintenance costs to be reasonable as well. Driving the van is easy and drives more like a car than other vans I have driven.  I do most of my own repair and maintenance and in most cases, this van is easy to work on.
However, the workspace under the hood is minimal making it hard to work on some areas of the engine.  In particular, changing some of the spark plugs I found to be very difficult the first time.  Once I figured out how to get to all plugs, subsequent changes were much easier. Also, there is a cowling cover inside the van to facilitate maintenance.
