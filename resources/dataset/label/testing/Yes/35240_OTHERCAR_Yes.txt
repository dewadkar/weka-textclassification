            I own a 94 Trooper s, with a five speed and now 60K miles.  I try to take good care of it, regular oil changes (3K) wash and wax once a week when weather agrees.  I use it for commuting, DIY building and yard materials, basic stuff and a few road trips.  I previously had a 1991 Nissan Pathfinder SE.  The Isuzu is just as good.  It runs very well, has enough power-though the new one is more powerful, and handles like an SUV.  Consumer reports wants people to think SUVs handle like sports cars and they don't.  In fact, I think the Trooper does feel a bit tippy, but does not tip.  Once you acquire a feel for it the Trooper handles quite well.  It's greatest virtue is the quality of the vehicle.  I'm probably damning myself but it does not rattle or squeak at all.  It runs perfectly.  The tires are getting old, and the exhaust shield brackets rotted off, but the exhaust otherwise is fine.  Even the interior looks pretty much mint.  Bearing in mind I'm probably more neurotic than most in the care department, it's still very good.  I'm also impressed with the body quality.  It has never been garaged, and has no rust anywhere except under the chrome trim on the wheel edge.  When and if I have to replace this vehicle, I will look very seriously at a new Trooper.<br><br>
