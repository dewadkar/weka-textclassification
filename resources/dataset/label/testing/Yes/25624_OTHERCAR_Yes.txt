            When I was shopping for a car to replace my ageing minivan, I wanted a car that was reliable, and I had heard of Saturn's excellent customer service reputation. I wanted a small maneuverable car, but I wanted it to also have a lot of room inside. Coming from a minivan, I really didn't want to adapt to a car trunk, so it was either going to be a hatchback or a station wagon. Finally, I am a very short person and I wanted a car with large enough rear windows where I could see out the back without having to add seat cushions to the driver seat. 

The Saturn wagon turned out to be a great fit for what I was looking for. Although the windows aren't as large as on the minivan, the driver's seat has a height adjustment that works out great for rear viewing. Someone else wrote in their review that as station wagons go, this is not the best available (it's not *that* big, and yes it isn't flat when you put the back seats down). However, because I was primarily looking for a compact, not a wagon, the amount of space I have is more like a bonus. I especially like the wide, flat rear gate area which makes loading and unloading easy. 

The main pro to owning a Saturn is the excellent service. I look exactly like the nice naive young girl that car shops try to swindle out of as much money as possible, and I was darn sick of that kind of treatment. As others have written, they do wash and vacuum my car every time I get an oil change and I think they even put a Rain-X equivalent on the windows. The official Saturn body work people who fixed up my car twice (two accidents; neither my fault) not only cleaned the car thoroughly, they put Armor-All over all of the inside vinyl. Plus there is the free donuts and popcorn and very friendly staff at the dealership.

There are a few cons as well. Despite the fact that this is a smaller car than a minivan, I still can't make U-turns. The turn radius is not good at all. The sun visors are not quite wide enough to block out the sun in all positions as the car turns. When wet, such as with early morning dew, sometimes the brakes squeal loudly for a several minutes. More importantly perhaps, Saturn engines are not very powerful. I have a twin-cam and it is adequate for most driving. (I test drove a Saturn from before the twin-cam and it was a complete wimp). And finally, the automatic transmission does not switch gears as smoothly as in other cars, and for best results I have to play with the accelerator when I approach the speed where the gear is supposed to change. (This is probably the 'random' surges someone else talked about.)

I would recommend the Saturn SW for anyone who wants a reliable, mid-sized car (really big hatchback :) ). I would recommend a Saturn of any kind for anyone who wants good, relatively uncrooked car service.
