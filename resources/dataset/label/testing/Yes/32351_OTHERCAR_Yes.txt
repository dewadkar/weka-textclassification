                 About 5 years ago I leased a 1995 VW Jetta because I was impressed with the quality of the VW company as well as all the features included in the price.  After my 4 year lease was up I decided to purchase it because I knew this car would last for about 10 more years.  
     What I like about the 95 VW Jetta is the smooth and easy handling while driving; the huge trunk that can fit 10 bags of groceries as well as 2 comforters; and how it heats up quickly in the winter and cools very quickly in the summer.  I have also been involved in an accident with this car and due to the impact of the other vehicle, I must say that it held up very well and I felt protected as well.  
     There are little things which I do not like about the car.  The locks on both sides have come out and have had to be replaced.  Another item with the locks is that they have the tendency to freeze when the weather is below freezing.  The side molding has come off twice, maybe due to the fact off hot weather loosening up the adhesive.
     Overall I have kept up with oil changes and maintenance and have never had it stall or break down on me.  I would recommend it for all ages.  It is sporty for those in their 20's yet sophisticated for those in their 70's.<br><br>
