            <b>What It Is & What You Get</b>

The Minolta G500 is a very small, nearly pocket-sized camera.  It measures only 3.5 inches wide, by just over 2 inches tall, and has a metal body which feels very sturdy when compared to today's plasticy cams.

In your box, you'll get the camera, a small rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack, battery charger, 16 meg Secure Digital memory card, all necessary software CDs (image program and manual), a quick setup guide, and a long, 18 inch neck strap.  Note, the full manual is on one of the CDs (boo Minolta) but as listed, you at least get a printed quick setup guide to get you started.

<b>Features & Photos</b>

The G500 is designed to primarily be a point-and-shoot camera.  The front of the camera has a sliding lens cover that doubles as the power switch.  Slide it open, and the camera starts up with a quick jingle, and green lights flash just below the lens.  It's quicker than most other cameras out there today, being ready to take the first shot in just over a second once turned on.

The top of the camera has the shutter button and microphone (for capturing sound notes or sound during movie clips).  The back has a minimal amount of buttons for zoom control, menu navigation, and reviewing/deleting photos, as well as a speaker for sound reviews.  The 1.5 inch color LCD is bright and clear.  

The bottom of the camera has the door to the compartment that contains the rechargeable battery, along with TWO slots for memory cards.  The G500 is able to accept both Secure Digital memory cards, as well as Memory Sticks (previously only on Sony cameras).  You can use only one, or both at the same time.  Nice idea, as it will allow those who may own several of one of those card formats to consider this camera as a purchase without having to buy more memory for it.  The included 16 meg card will get you started, but will only hold a few photos, so opt for a larger card immediately.  

<b>Options</b>

The camera will allow you to take images from a low 640x480 pixels in size (for emails) up to 5 megapixels ( 2592x1944 pixels ) for large prints.  There are options for manual controls over shutter speed, two aperture settings, and white balance, but you do have to delve into the menu system to find them.  Again, keyword:  Point-and-shoot.  

The 3X zoom ( 39-117mm on a film camera ) is about average for many cameras these days.  It's not quite appropriate for long range wildlife photography, but will work for & everyday photos just fine.  It appears to be a good lens, as images are sharp, and contain a good bit of detail & even better than some full-sized 5 megapixel cameras on the market.  I took some images to my local Sam's Club and had some 8x10 prints made via their Fuji digital printer.  Colors were vibrant and accurate, details were very good, and there was only a very small amount of blue fringing visible along the tree tops where they met the sky - not easy to see once the photo was on the wall, and with a bit of tweaking in an image editor, you can reduce it even more.  The prints were as good as many mid-range 35mm cameras on the market.

There is a movie mode which is a pretty standard 320x240 pixels in size, but it does capture sound, and it's better than not being able to capture video at all.  Once you take your photos, you can save them, delete them, or resize them to a smaller email size and save a copy for later use.  If you have two memory cards in the camera, it will switch to the other once the first one is full.  When both are full, 2 megs of built-in memory will kick in, but will only allow you to take a few 640x480 images.

If the images are not up to your liking, you can spend time in the menus and tweak scene modes, saturation, sharpness, and individual color controls.  As mentioned, it's really a point-and-shoot, but for those wanting more control who don't mind searching the menus, more is offered.  It should be noted that you will need to spend some time studying the CD manual for the G500.  While you can get the hang of it fairly quickly, the menu system can be a little tricky for beginners, so if in doubt, look it up.

<b>Picky Things</b>

I'm picky, and nothing is perfect, so I have a couple of small gripes.  First, the tripod socket on the bottom of the camera is on the far side of it, and not centered.  Should you wish to take a photo at night or which involves a slow shutter speed, you will need to use a tripod, and having it located where it's at causes the camera to lean, hence, giving you a crooked shot.  Dumb.  

The lens cover/power switch will keep fingerprints off of your lens, and protect it from bumps when not in use, but if you hold it up to a bright light, you will see the light shining in-between the cover and camera.  It is not airtight;  dust WILL get to the lens, so keep it in a camera case when not in use.  I'm also not a fan of a sliding cover being a power switch as well; to me, that's just one more mechanism that can break.  Give me a power button anyday.

Putting the full manual on a CD doesn't win favors with me, as I am a firm believer in printed manuals for buyers ( hint, Minolta ).

Last, and a minor one, is the included 18 inch neck strap.  Now come on, does anyone actually wear a camera as a necklace??  I sure wouldn't trust a $399 camera's safety to a tiny strap bolt with it swinging around my neck, would you?   C'mon camera makers, smarten up.  A camera is not jewelry - learn this, please.

<b>Conclusion</b>

All minor gripes aside, I still like this camera a lot.  You cannot currently find a 5 megapixel, metal bodied camera for under $400 anywhere else.  Especially one that takes such good photos, is so fast, and offers two memory card formats?  Wow.

There are plenty of times you simply do not want to lug a full-sized digital camera  around with you.  Until now this meant carrying a smaller camera which did not offer you image quality that might compare to your larger camera.  That had changed with the G500.  While it won&#146t replace a "prosumer" model with tons of manual options, it makes a perfect "take anywhere" camera that will please most.

The holiday are upon us again, and the G500 will fit into many stockings - hint hint


<b>UPDATE</b>:  An update on customer service by Minolta.  I decided to email Minolta with a question about resizing images in-camera.  Since the main manual is on a CD, and some digicam buyers do not own computers, I figured this was a valid test.  It took 5 days to get an email back from them, and it was not an automatic response.  However, the reply to my inquirie?  "Read your manual".  That was it.  I also inquired about extended warranties and the reply - "We do not offer these", period.  Hmm... so, rather than ask a question they want you to pop a CD in and look it up (and again, some cam buyers do not own computers... they take their memory cards in to be processed), and unlike most other camera makers, they do not offer extended warranties.

I still recommend this camera.  As per my review it takes great images and is worth the money paid.  If there were a category for customer service however, I would give Minolta a thumbs-down.  As long as you own a computer so you can view the CD manual, and you are not the type that may need further assistance on their end, you should be fine.
