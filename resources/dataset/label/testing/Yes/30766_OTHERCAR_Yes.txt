              The D-340R is by far one of the best entry level Digital Cameras.  The pictures are always crisp and the colors are very lifelike.  The SmartMedia cards provide a quick and efficient storage method.  The cards themselves are small enough to be kept in a small space.  I bought a compact carrying case from a local camera shop with a pouch just large enough for the SmartMedia Cards.  This camera takes Megapixel images, has autofocus, autoflash, and a color LCD display.  It has everything you could want from a camera for ~$299.  The Macro mode allows you to take close ups of small items while retaining amazing details.  This is simply an all around good camera.<br><br>
