            Let me start by saying I work for a College, and it with the vast resources of that College I was able to get my hands on this lovely little camera.  I have used it extensively for a few months and have a couple of things to say for and against it.  We'll start with the bad news... after a short time of being used the menu button (4 position joystick item) stopped functioning correctly, one must try several times when pushing it to the right.  That's annoying, but forgivable.  The biggest gripe I've got with this unit is the excessive lag time when you push the button to take the picture.  Our college also has a lesser Sony camera and it does not exhibit this problem.  It does indeed make taking action photography impossible... in fact if the subject is moving at all you can bet the picture you get is not the picture you saw when you pushed the button.  The next problem I luckily didn't have to deal with, the price of the camera... weighing it at around $1000 on a good day, it's too pricey for most consumers.  The disk access time is reasonable, and any drawbacks of having to wait a few extra seconds is more than outweighed by the convenience of using dirt cheap and widely compatible 3.5" disks for media.  Now let's get started on the good things about this camera.  All frills and faults aside, the whole point of a camera is to take good pictures... well with minor adjustment of a few settings this camera takes fantastic pictures at up to 1600x1200dpi resolution.  As per the fault of jpgs in general, the pictures do have noticeable artifacts when you zoom in, but at not enough to distract from the overall look of the photo.  The program key on the side lets you adjust for different light settings, and has some very helpful presets in it.  If you're feeling brave you can adjust the f-stop or shutter speed manually via the first two options under the program key.  Setting the f-stop at around 8 and using the flash can produce rich colors and an improved depth of field over the standard method of shooting.  One thing to be aware of is that when you do move the f-stop to a higher number, it lets less light into the camera, thereby dimming the LCD panel (or viewfinder) considerably... because the camera does not have an optical viewfinder this makes it difficult to frame pictures well with the f-stop set to a high number.  I rarely find myself using the top mounted viewfinder on the camera as the LCD panel provides a larger and more visible depiction of what the camera is pointed at.  A very neat little gadget they thought to build into this camera is a sensor in the viewfinder.  The viewfinder is off until you move it close to your eye to look through it, at which point it comes one... very neat, still I wish they would have went for an optical viewfinder.  Macro and auto focus both work very well for most applications, manually focussing the camera is a little difficult because of the sensitivity of the focus ring on the end of the lens...  The Steady Shot, as it's namesake, keeps the camera from responding to every tiny movement in your hand... creating a steadier picture with less chance of motion blur.  The flash on the camera works well for all non-macro photos.  As I had mentioned before to get a good picture with the flash you would have to set the f-stop (anywhere from 4-9.6), which causes your preview image to go dark.  For macro shots, the lens gets in the way of the flash, causing a u-shaped ring of darkness on the photo, alternative lighting is necessary for such photos.  The lens has a 52mm filter thread on the end for attaching any of your favorite optical filters to the camera.  The built in filters take care of a lot of problem color issues, and the built in effects can produce some very interesting photos (I'm thoroughly in love with the sepia effect on this camera).  The camera can take up to 15 second mpeg movies, with real time audio and video... I found that impressive.  You can even set the camera to allow you to record an audio track with every picture you take... those features and related ones I haven't had much use for, but it is nice to have them.
