            I am not a professional photographer.  Not even an amateur "expert".  But I do know a quality camera when I see one.  Much detail has been written about the S30 in all the other reviews so I won't waste your time repeating it.  But I will give you my impression of this little beauty.

I have owned many cameras in my day.  From Brownies to Leica's.  I count 30+ cameras owned over the years (I'm not exactly young).  I've had pre-war German cameras with great lenses, SLR's from most of the major Japanese Manufacturers; and smaller cameras the past 20 years (because the quality of their pictures had improved enough to make it desirable to use a more portable device to take photographs).  I went to a seminar some years ago that had digital photography as its subject.  I decided the product  was nowhere near film quality and rejected the technology as premature.  Well, it snuck up on me while I wasn't looking.  When the density of the picture reached 3,4 or 5MP the digital age had arrived.

Several months ago I decided to buy a digital camera.  I required that it take as good a picture as my 35MM Minox and Olympus, two rangefinder cameras that have given me great service.  It had to be small enough to be able to be carried in a pocket.  It had to have an excellent "auto" ability as well as a significant ability to adjust settings.  It also  had to be affordable.  

After reading all the reviews (and seeing the cameras in the stores) I initially focused on the Olympus C50 (5MP and relatively pricey), The Olympus C4000 (4MP and not very portable) and the Olympus D550 (3MP, minimal adjusting ability and mixed reviews).  I kept deferring my decision to buy.  When sale prices started settling down I found that the Canon S30 was pricing itself near the C4000 --and it had a Li-Ion battery and charger included to boot.  The more I thought about the S30, the better it looked.  It is small enough to pocket yet not too small to handle.  It has an excellent lens.  The metal body is very durable (and beautiful).  Also, Canon provides a great tutorial on its web site as well as updates for software and camera firmware.  The cost?  A major electronics discount store (probably having a slow week) met some internet prices I showed them. (Bought it for $350.00 --new and unopened).

But I haven't told you how I feel about this product.  It's a jewel!  The feel of it.  The look of it.  The sound of it.  And it works better than I ever expected.  A 16MB Compact Flash Card is not enough only because once the camera is in your hands you must take pictures!  No problem.  64MB costs about $20.00 now and you can reuse it 1,000,000 times (they say).  The battery recharges in about an hour and even the charger is an elegant little device.

It's not usual for me to get emotional over an inanimate object.  Last time was over a Mooney 201 (small aircraft).  If you choose this one you may just get hooked.  

March Update:  On EBAY, I purchased 64MB of Compact Flash memory for $21.00 + $3.00 s&h (from BRANDENBURKHART).  I also purchased an NB-2L battery for $12.00 + $5.95 s&h (from EFORCETRADING).  THEY BOTH WORK PERFECTLY!
