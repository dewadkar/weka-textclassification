            This is a great little SUV, the twin to the CHevy Tracker yet with more std equipment.  It is indeed truck based so if you are looking for a cushy buick like ride, look elsewhere.
I achieve around 25 MPG in all around driving.  The radio is nice and puts out plenty of sound.  
I have a 5 speed and I would avoid the automatic unless  you live in Kansas.  The heater cranks but the AC needs more capactiy.  Tinted windows is the way to go if you have hot summers.
The seats will fold flat on the 4 door and this opens up a good sized cargo space.  The seats are the equal of anything Detroit uses these days.  Most of the parts come from Japan yet the vehicle is assembled in Canada by CAMI.
Some controls are not too well placed.  The cruise control is a disaster, twist up to set twist down to coast and its not lighted so night time use makes the spot lights under the mirror mandatory.  The outboard panel vents will continue to blow air, like most Asian cars, even when you select floor, defrost or mix.  To get full airflow to either of those areas you will need to close those vents.  The heater really puts out well, but the AC leaves a lot to be desired.  Tinting the windows will help a bunch as I have done this.

The engine is indeed a hamster!  

Below 3,000 you wonder if anything at all is under the hood.  Rev it up a bit and it comes alive albeit with a loud voice.  The five speed is a bit notchy and not on par with the best Asian stick shifts.  Yet it gets the job done with little drama.

The ride is a bit pogo stick like on choppy roads but it will smooth out on the hiway. Watch the cross winds; this is a high profile vehicle and needs to be driven according ly.
Brakes work so-so, I would prefer more feel in the pedal here. However, it will lock all 4 tires if need be.  I don't have antilock so I cannot comment on those.

Servicing is basically easy save for the oil filter.  Air filter and plugs are easily serviced by the average do it yourselfer.  Downside is the fact that the NGK Iridium plugs are expensive.  And Suzuki recommends them as opposed to another type.

************UPDATE***************************
SInce last review, I have had the alternator take a dive. It was replaced along with the wiring harness from the alternator to the battery + terminal.  Otherwise no problems and its running fine on Mobil 1 synthetic oil.

19,800 on the clock and she's still running strong 22-26 in town. Installing Cooper weathermaster tires this weekend to bolster winter weather drivability.
