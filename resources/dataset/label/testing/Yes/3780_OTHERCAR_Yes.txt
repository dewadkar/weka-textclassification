            First off, I have also posted this review under the 3 series as well so you don't need to review it (unless you really like it). This is a fantastic car.  It's the real deal.  I highly recommend anyone buying one though to look at the European delivery option.  There are two BMW dealers in my city.  Both had the exact same European delivery price but one also threw in $1000 towards travel expenses and included a high speed driving course (Bondurant) lesson in their price.  I bought the car last summer and toured Europe for three months in it, racking up almost 9000 miles.  There is nothing like cruising the autobahn at 145 MPH with the sunroof open.

By buying it here and doing European delivery you get the chance to tour Europe and enjoy the car it was meant to be enjoyed, at high speeds on the autobahn (if you go to Germany).  Even if you do not go for as long a period of time as I did it is still worth it if your dealer throws in the travel expenses, etc. like mine did.  You might also save on taxes depending on the state you live in.  BMW also pays for the registration and zero deductible insurance for the time you drive it in Europe as well as the shipping to your local dealer. I figure altogether I saved about $6000 on my car.  

The zero deductible insurance provided with European delivery was nice also and saved me some extra money.  In the time I was there I damaged my front spoiler on a dirt road, banged a door in a tight parking garage and somehow damaged one of my rims.  BMW repaired and replaced all parts when the car was delivered to the states so I picked up a BMW in showroom condition when it was delivered.  You can pick up and drop off in almost every major European city.  If you pick it up in Munich you also get a VIP tour of the factory there.

The downside to European delivery is that it takes 4-8 weeks from the time you drop the car off in Europe to when you pick it up here in the states. It took them 7 weeks to deliver my car (although they did have to repair the body work). You also get spoiled on the speed.  When the car is delivered to the states they reprogram the cars computer so that half the valves shut off at 123 MPH. 

The car handles like a dream.  Cruising in it at 100 MPH it feels like you are going 40 MPH in an average car.  The car is a high performance car that handles the road very well.  After driving this car I can't imagine going back to an average car or an SUV or anything.  This car is FUN, FUN, FUN to drive and even more FUN if you get to drive it in Germany.<br><br>
