            I love my Avenger.  I bought my 1997 Avenger NEW in 1999.  To make a long story short, it was a leftover that never got sold.  It had 100 miles on it when I got it and so I got a great deal.  I almost bought one 4 years ago, but was trading in my Daytona and felt like I wanted something a bit different, so I bought a Stratus (also nice car).  When the warranty ran out, I was ready to go back to something sportier (and more eye-catching!).  I have had the car about a year and it now has almost 13,000 miles on it.  

It runs like a dream, regardless of the weather and handles beautifully.  I feel very safe in it and I love some of the features, like the driver side seat controls and the stereo sound.  It also won't let you lock your keys in the car, which I have been known to do from time to time and I appreciate that.  About the only thing that is sometimes a problem is that it sits very low to the ground, so it occasionally scrapes a curb and sometimes when it snows, you have to shovel underneath the front.  Other than that, it really has not needed much except for one or two things from sitting idle on the lot for so long.

I think this is a great car!  I would buy it again and I might buy another when I'm ready to trade.<br><br>
