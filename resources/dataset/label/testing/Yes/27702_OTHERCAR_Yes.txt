            	I was bitten by the convertible bug back in 1994 when I drove out to Yosemite with a friend in his Miata, so when Mitsubishi announced that they'd finally be producing a convertible Eclipse, I rushed straight to my dealer.  Several months (and 24 thousand dollars later) I was zipping around in a peppy red machine, gunning the motor at stop signs, and racing down the freeway.  A few speeding tickets over the years has lightened my gas foot a bit, but for the most part, it's still an exciting car four years after the initial test drive.
	The convertible top is particularly well engineered.  Just snap two latches, press a button, and look up at the sky.  Twice I've been caught in sudden downpours and I was very thankful that closing the top is equally simple.
	Room is definitely at a premium.  The back seat is no picture of luxury and the convertible model replaces the roomy hatchback with a surprisingly deep but ridiculously short trunk.  Still, an uncomfortable back seat is better than no back seat at all when you have friends in town, and to its credit, we did manage to fit in four people and a CELLO at a particularly needy moment.  Of course, that never would have worked if we couldn't put the top down.
	The car is now 4 years old, and its had a few visits to the shop.  I had to have the wires to the spark plugs replaced, but that was the fault of my mechanic who put in the wrong plugs at 30 thousand miles.  One significant failure was the convertible top motors which died after 40K.  If it wasn't for my extended warranty, I would have been put out over a thousand dollars.
	This is a convertible, and creaks and rattles are a foregone conclusion as the car ages.  Still, it handles well and the turbo engine is a thrill when it engages.  I'm happy to say, I'd do it all over again.
