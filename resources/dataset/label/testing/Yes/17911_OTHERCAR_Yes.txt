            I purchased by 98 Mountaineer new and have just taken it in for my first-ever service call - a minor problem that was instantly remedied.  Having previously owned a Jeep (which I loved) and a Chevy Blazer (NEVER again), I'm a Mountaineer fan for the duration.  

My model was top-of-the line at that time and made the Explorer look like a stock model.  The Mountaineer is solid, stylish, rugged, totally dependable. 

I worried about the mileage with a V8 but it has improved after 30,000 miles.  I'll be honest - at present, it isn't a bargain to put gas in any big tank, but for my needs this car is almost exclusively used for highway driving - and therefore I find it sufficiently economical.  

I'm pleasantly surprised that the exterior has held up just like new - no dings or nicks.  Visibility is superb and although it's not up as &quot;high&quot; as other SUV's, I'm very comfortable and feel extremely safe on the highway. 

I'll never buy another plain-old-car, and I'll definitely keep this one when I buy my next Mountaineer.<br><br>
