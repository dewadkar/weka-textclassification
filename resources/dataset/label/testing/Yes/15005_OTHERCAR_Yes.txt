            I have owned the sony digital camera MVC-FD73 for over a year now and am very very pleased.  I am definately not a camera expert, and that's one of the reasons why I love this camera so much.  I use it to take all of my pictures that I put on E-bay for auctions.  I also use it to document things, such as collections, vacations, etc...  This is a wonderful lightweight camera that is great to travel with.  The film helps out a lot too,  The camera takes 3.5 discs that are easy to bring along in the camera case.  It is very nice to know that you don't have to pay for film!  I take pictures of everything, lots of indoors and outdoors in many different lighting conditions.  The camera is great because it will adjust itself to take a good picture,  you don't have to mess with f-stops, apertures, and all that other fussy stuff with regular cameras.

To operate the camera all you really have to do is take the lens cap off, turn it on, and shoot.  it's that easy.  Of course if you want, you can adjust many different options with ease.  No viewfinder either!!!  All you do is look at the screen on the back of the camera and it shows you in real time exactly what the picture is going to look like.  You don't have to move around a lot because there is a very easy to use zoom in or out button.  Nothing to twist or perfect.  You can also view what you have already taken pictures of by switching from camera to play,  it's a little button on the back.  The camera will then show you what you've already shot!!! No more forgetting!	

The camera comes with its own rechargeable lithium battery that lasts over 200 minutes.  I bought an extra for convenience reasons, such as being away from home on vacation.  The 3.5 disc is just an ordinary computer disc, and can hold about 20 to 40 pictures per disc.  Of course it depends on high or low resolution, etc...  The camera also costs less than $500.00.  A great deal if you ask me.  It paid itself off with film and developing charges in less than half a year!!!

The only bad thing about the camera is that you have to get used to pixels in your pictures.  I'm not complaining, but they aren't exactly photo quality.  They are good enough in my book to take the place of paying for film and developing, etc...  I still have my Minolta on hand in case I come across a picture that I want to have a professional look.

I recommend this camera very much,  It has been one of my best purchases in the last 5 years.
