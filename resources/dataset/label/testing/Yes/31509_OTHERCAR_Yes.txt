            I have had the Nissan Sentra SE Limited for 6 months now and it is really nice. Many sweet options come standard in this car.  Some of them are cd, sunroof, alloy wheels, cruise, and spoiler...Awesome price for what you get. I was also looking at the civic before buying the Sentra, but the civic costs a lot more and the engine isnï¿½t nearly as good. The Sentra SE comes with atleast 150hp. It gives you a smooth ride; This car is outstanding for someone who has a budget around 15,000. This car beats all cars in the price range. Overall the car is the best for the price range but the shape is kind of funny looking.  That is the only problem i found with the car.  Other than that this car is a wonderful buy.<br><br>
