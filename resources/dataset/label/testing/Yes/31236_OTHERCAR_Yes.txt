            In 1995 I purchased a new Grand am. It was not what I wanted but it was all I could afford at the time. I was not excited about this car at all except that it ran. After a couple months I fell in love with it. It was so comfortable, roomy and was great on gas. During the 4 years I owned this car we went on many vacations to Florida and Georgia in it. My husband, 3 kids and a bunch of luggage fit comfortably.
Not once did we have to put the car in the shop. It ran like a new car the entire 4 years it was part of my family.
This past August we traded it in for a new Blazer (which was what I wanted in the first place) and I have regretted it ever since. The Blazer gets horrible gas mileage. I find myself filling it up 2 to 3 times a week, which with the Grand am I only, filled it up once every week and a half.
I miss my Grand am. I would recommend anyone looking for a new car to at least go drive one,Iï¿½m sure you will love it as much as I do.
