  Universities of California are known for their abundance in the ever so trendy Honda Civic. Every other car I see driving on campus is a Honda. It is not only a cute sporty car, the Honda Civic is also reliable.

  My mother gave me a '99 Civic for my graduation this past summer. I love it to death. Although it does not have much power (It is an automatic and they do not have the same power as a stick), it still handles smoothly. About three weeks ago ran over an island trying to make a U-turn and the only thing that got messed up was the plastic hubcaps on the tires. 

  Another thing I like about Civics and all the other Hondas is that they last a long time. I have seen Hondas that are 20 years old still moving' around town, and they still look good after so long. Oh yes, one more thing. It is also good if you get a Civic Coup, that way you will not have to yell at little kids to keep their doors closed and windows shut.
