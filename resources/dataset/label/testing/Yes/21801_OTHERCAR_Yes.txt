            We have a 1998 transport and we absolutely love it.  We have had almost a year and a half and have had little problems with it.  It had to have a new power window motor put in and a new radio, but it was covered under warranty.  The pontiac service is excellent where I live.  
I love all the extra room in it.  We have the 3 seats in the middle and the 2 seats in the back, since we don't haul a bunch of kids around.  We only have two children.  The seats remove pretty easy and are a little heavy.  I think they are around 35-40 pounds each.  
We got the second sliding door on ours.  I wouldn't get a van without it.  It is so much easier to get both the kids in the car and into their carseats. 
We have air bags on both front seats and also it comes with side airbags on the front seat.  
It gets good gas mileage for a V-6,  about 25 highway and 18-20/city.
