            If you are going to buy a SUV, the Ford Explorer seems to be the one to get.  It is consistently rated the best and the price is pretty reasonable.  I have no complaints to date, although I have only owned the car for one year.  If you have a kid and need to put a car seat in the back, you will need to put the car seat on one of the sides, it does not appear to work in the middle.  The truck seems to eat gas, but I think that is true with all these SUV's.  The seats are comfortable, the handling is fine, the power is good, the trunk is large.  All around, I am happy with the Ford Explorer, although I hate the car salesmen that sold the car to me.  Enjoy.<br><br>
