                 The Jeep Wrangler sport is one of the most affordable and best quality vehicles on the road today.  I just bought my second Wrangler I still have my 1997 but the ride in the new sport model is hands down smoother and quieter than my older SE model.  The simplicity of the Wrangler is one of the most attractive selling points but it in no way hinders the buyer in being able to personalize the Jeep.  There are countless add ons that you can purchase which are directly made for Jeep Wranglers this is a great advantage for do it yourselfer's.  Once you buy a Jeep Wrangler you will never want a different type of vehicle, it is like being in a fraternity in college you are loyal to your group.  One thing I would like to tell any prospective buyer is to drive on and see if you like the experience it is a little louder than some other vehicles but the sport model is far above anything Jeep has made, the noise is minimal at best.  I live in the Northeast where snow is a problem as well as ice and both of my Jeeps are outstanding in inclement weather.  My advice to anyone with a little adventure in their soul and a kid at heart is look into buying a Wrangler you will never regret it.
