            I use my Sub to pull a 20 foot boat a dozen times a year.  It's loaded down with all the camping gear and a family of five.  Pulls to where ever it will fit without a problem.  My Sub now has near 80K miles on it with very little problems found. Unloaded it gets 17MPG! The brake shoes and pads don't last very long so you have to check them every other oil change.
What I think is really great, oil changes,brake pads and shoes are easy to change. The main belt can be changed without any tools required.  It will take longer to change a flat!
I live in the country and take the Sub on tight 30mph roads that demand quick turns and good handling characteristics. It's not a sports car but it's not a boat either.  The 350 V8 puts out tons of power and torque.  Fully loaded with the 42 gallon tank I have over 300 mile range.
