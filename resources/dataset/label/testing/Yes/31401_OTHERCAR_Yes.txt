               This was my first car purchase, and I wanted it to be a success. I spent countless hours doing research on cars in my price range and with the features I thought were important. After narrowing it down to four cars (the Alero, Chevy Malibu, Volkswagen Jetta, Pontiac Grand Am), the choice was clear, hands down: The Alero -- sleek, sporty yet comfortable, reliable, powerful and cute -- had everything I wanted. 
   It was the smoothest ride, not jerky like the Malibu. It was sexy, not boxy and boring like the Jetta, and everything in it and on it looked quality, well-built, not cheap-looking like the Pontiac. 
   It cost a little more than I originally wanted to spend, but for what I got, I think it was a good deal. My Alero is a silver 2-door, V6, automatic transmission, power windows and doors with theft-deterrent system, power driver's seat, CD and cassette player radio with Theftlock. 
   It has pretty good leg room in back for a 2-door, and extraordinary trunk space. It's fun to drive, too. If you're looking for a car that can be a &quot;family&quot; car but still has that sexy coolness about it, this is the car for you.

After driving the Alero now for about five months, I haven't had any problems with it, but there are some annoyances:

1) The driver's side door has two switches for the <b>power windows</b>, one to open the passenger-side window and one to open the driver's side window. The one for the driver's side says &quot;auto,&quot; and if you tap it down once, the window opens all the way. However, you can't roll the window up with just a touch, you have to hold the lever in the up position for the length of time it takes for the window to roll up. I don't understand why, with a switch that says &quot;auto,&quot; it is only auto for rolling the window down, and not for rolling the window up as well.

2) When you use the <b>blinker</b>: A normal blinker will turn off once you've made your turn, but on this one, unless you turn the steering wheel sharply back in the other direction, the blinker lever remains engaged. So on turns that are not as sharp as a 90-degree turn, I have to click the lever back myself. Sometimes I forget to do that and realize a mile down the road that my blinker is still on, and I feel like an idiot.

3) The <b>front end</b> is a little long and low to the ground, so I find myself having to go practically sideways over dips or down driveways so I don't scrape the nose on the ground (nevertheless, I've scraped the nose on the ground more than a few times). And I used to make fun of my dad, who drove virtually sideways at all times in his Camaro.

4) And finally: Don't you dare attempt to drive this thing without fastening your <b>seatbelt</b>, because if you do, you'll be assaulted with a <i>loud and incessant</i> beeping, and after about 25 beeps, a bright red seatbelt symbol on the display panel will flash, and flash, and flash, and flash, and flash, and flash ... you get my point? <i>Annoying!!</i>
