            I was able to get a RSX Type-S before anyone else in my state.  I had ordered it, and I picked it up the day before they were formally introduced.

I actually bought it without even driving it.  I had read countless reviews, and all of them were equally raving.  Well, once I got in, I was not disappointed.  

I wanted something that would be fun to drive, and this is just that!  This car is unbelievable responsive.  The steering is perfect.  The steering wheel itself is very small in diameter, so it has a racy feel.  When you touch the wheel, the cars moves into place.  It's almost as if this car knows where I want to go.

I read a review here on Epinions where the reviewer was saying this car has no torque.  I completely disagree.  When I touch the gas, this car takes off.  It has so much power in every gear, it's amazing that it's a 4-cylinder.  I read in many reviews that this engine is very similar to that of the Honda S2000, and that car's engine is already legendary.  Plus, you get better fuel mileage with the 4-cylinder.  Hey, how can you complain about 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds (per "Car and Driver").

What I really love is the interior.  The seats are amazing.  Nice leather sport buckets that absolutely hug you in your seat.  When I take a corner faster than I should, these don't let me move at all.  It also has a power moonroof, 6-disc in-dash CD changer, automatic climate control, cruise, power everything, and a rear-window wiper.  And all of this comes standard!

If you're in the market for a sports car with a luxurious feel, then check out the Acura RSX.  I would strongly recommend the Type-S.  It has the larger engine (200 hp) and everything I listed above.  Not to mention the looks you'll get when you drive by people (I've already gotten more stares than I have with all of my other cars combined).
