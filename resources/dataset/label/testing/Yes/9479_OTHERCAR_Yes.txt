            We bought a 1997 Dodge Ram pickup. Lets just say after week one, the side mirrors never would stay in place. If you drove over 50 mile an hour they would slowly start moving in towards your window. We contacted the dealership. They &quot; fixed it&quot;. NOT!! Then about a month later my son and I were almost killed because the brakes went out while I was trying to stop at a stop sign on top of a hill. All the lights came on and no brakes.

 I had to throw it into reverse and slam on the emergency brake in order to keep from rolling over the hill into a building. No one could figure out what was causing this. So needless to say we took the truck back they traded us for another one. Low and behold two month later the same brake problem happened with this truck as well. Only this time we had it in the shop off and on for 6 months and they never could get it to duplicate it. It took me and my son getting in a wreck before it was documented by the police investigator that there was serious brake issues with this truck.

 Dodge needs to do an over haul on their brake systems before they release the trucks. Or train their technicians how to que in better on these problems. I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing one of these.
