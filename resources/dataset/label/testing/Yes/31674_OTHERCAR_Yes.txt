            Last summer I bought a 1988 Chevy Conversion Van because I got tired of trying to squeeze my husband and five children into a car. They all would fit but it was very uncomfortable and it's hard enough travelling with kids much less uncomfortable kids!

I decided to buy a used van as a brand new one is relatively expensive so I went to The Car Store in my area and started looking. I told the gentleman what I was looking for and in less than two weeks, he had gotten one in. Now I've been in vans before but none like this one so when I opened the side door, I was amazed at all the features.

The van was full size and I could almost stand up in it. The seats were most comfortable and not only did they recline but the front two swiveled as well. The last seat in back was a bench seat that converted into a bed and I thought this would be a great option when travelling with children. Between the seats there was a place to secure in little tables that could hold snacks and four drinks. With curtains all around the sides and the back of the van, I felt like I was in a small apartment.

Between the front two seats, there was a console that was big enough to hold two drinks and a variety of other things. This particular van came with an AM/FM radio with cassette and also a cd player that would hold ten disks. Overhead we had a CB radio and assorted switches that controlled all the lights in the van. In the middle of the console was a place for a mini television although one wasn't in it.

I could go on forever about my van but I won't. My opinion is, if you're looking for comfort and a good sized van, I suggest you at least take one of these for a test drive but be forewarned, once you take it out for a spin and feel it's comfort with all its features, you'll be hooked!  <br><br>
