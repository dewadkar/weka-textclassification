            We purchased the 1995 as a used vehicle on recommendation from a friend that owned the &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; version of this vehicle.  Transmission work was just done on this vehicle at 76K. 

 My friend, Bill also had transmission work done on his T&amp;C at about the same mileage but had no major problems since then. 
 
This vehicle is a pleasure to drive and hugs the highway giving extra confidence when those tractor trailers pass too close to you. The built in child seats are also a plus since we have two sets of twins just one year apart ..saved us on buying two extra child restraint seats.  

The vehicle is a little picky with the type of gas you use though.  Regular gas is just too regular for this minivan it has a picky taste that would show up as a quick hesitation as when you need a new gas filter.  

The extra luggage space comes in handy to store those extra baby bags and I love the tinted windows.  It gives me about the same mileage as my dodge shadow but the gas gauge is a little deceptive in that 100 miles after a fill the needle does not move but for the 10 miles it would move considerably. 

 I find that the 1995 model has a more rugged look than the later models.<br><br>
