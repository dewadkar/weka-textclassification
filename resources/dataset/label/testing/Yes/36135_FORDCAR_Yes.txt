            I bought this car new and have put over 50,000 miles on it in 2 years. Yes, I've had a couple of recalls, but so what? At least Ford is onn top of things. I have not had any major repairs - just replaced the tires and had my brakes done. 

I have the hatchback model, and I do regret buying a 2-door, but only because my passengers have to climb in & out. The car doesn't get the gas mileage one would expect from such a little car, but it makes up for it with the quick acceleration. I ENJOY driving this car. The standard sound system is more than adequate. The seats are quite comfortable. Much more so than my husband's fancy, leather-seated "family car." My biggest complaint is the placement of the rear-view mirror. (I am short and I can never adjust it quite comfortably.) 

I would not hesitate to buy this car if I had it to do all over again.
