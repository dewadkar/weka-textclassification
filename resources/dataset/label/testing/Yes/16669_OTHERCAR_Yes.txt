            I bought my 2001 Subaru in 2002.  My dark green GT Ltd was the last one on the lot and was deeply discounted.  At the time I bought my Subaru, I was also considering the Nissan Maxima and the Infinity I-30.  The Subaru came out on top.

Compared to these other sedans, the Subaru was a blast to drive.  The GT Ltd provided top of the line stereo, leather seating, powered moon roof and a sharp spoiler.  Though less powerful than the Nissan/Infinity, the 5-speed is pretty spry.  I do wish it had a little more horsepower though for the top end, maybe a 6-cylinder rather than the 4-cylinder boxer style engine.  If you are considering this car, you must have the manual transmission!  (The automatic is pretty sluggish.)

Still, overall I'm very satisfied with my choice.  The fuel economy is very good.  The AWD is very stable, and gives me a lot of confidence driving, even in the icy winter.  The inside is well appointed and comfortably seats four adults.  Another bonus is that not many people drive this model, and I've never seen another one of the same color.  I never lose this dark green beauty in a parking lot, and I get a lot of compliments on how nice it looks.

As for complaints other than the power, it does rattle a little at speed (but then I also drive it VERY fast).  Wind noise also seems a little excessive at speed.  And I also have some difficulty seeing out the high rear window--and the blindspots seem very large.

Still and all, I don't regret my choice and would recommend this car to others.
