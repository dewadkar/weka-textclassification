                 I bought my '93 Ford Tempo in June of 1993.  Curiously, I bought it just after being fired from my previous job.  (What can I say?  I've always been a contrary person.) From the time I started looking for a car that day, to the minute I signed the forms, paid for the car (cash, no loan) and drove it off the lot, I spent less than an hour and a half total time.  Obviously, neither being fired from my job nor taking so little time to make the choice affected my judgment, or the outcome.  I've since found in the 9 years I've owned the car that I made an excellent choice.

     That day in June where I took possession, I paid $11,995 (tax, title, destination charges, etc., all included) for that car.  It had 13 miles on it then; it has 225,000 miles now.  I fully expected to get no more than 80,000-90,000 miles out of it before it died, so I've gotten over twice the service and longevity from it I thought.  Through all that time, and all those miles, the car has been an excellent provider of transportation and reliability.  I've only had one major problem, and that was entirely my fault.  At 63,000 miles I managed to "cook" the engine by driving for miles while the temperature gauge was way past the "red zone".  That cost $800 to fix.  No other problems.

     Fuel economy has been very good.  I drive 5-6 days a week into Chicago from Gary, Indiana; about a 110 mile round trip.  Every once in a while, I track the amount of gasoline I use for a 3,000 mile period.  Each time I get the same figure; 28.5 miles per gallon for combined city/highway driving.  That's with much of the driving being very heavy, slow speed, stop and go traffic in and around Chicago.  That's also with the complete list of power accessories available; my Tempo has power steering, brakes, windows, and door locks.  Remarkable!

     One thing I highly recommend to any Tempo owner is to get the premium sound insulation package.  Naturally, you can't put that on a used car that doesn't already have it.  However, try to shop for one that does.  You'd be amazed at how quietly a small car will ride with the extra insulation.  It also makes listening to your stereo much more pleasant.

     I'm very pleased generally with the life I get from the car's major mechanical components.  I've only just replaced the original transmission at 203,000 miles; I replaced the original struts at 165,000 miles, and I'm only on the second muffler.  However, there is one negative point I'll make about this car here; it loves to eat water pumps.  They only last about 40,000 miles, and I'm on my fourth one.  (A mechanic once told me that's a typical problem for the '93 Tempo.)  Even tires wear well; I usually get about 60,000 miles on a set (I spend no more than $200 for 4 tires).

     You'd do well to get a used Tempo; just make sure it's had reasonable care, and don't get one with too many miles (like mine).  The Tempo has had a long production history (going well back into the 80s), so there is a lot of data available on it.  You may wish to check the extensive articles available on the Tempo in "Consumer Reports".  Make a sound choice, and you'll have a good used car that will last for years.  The days of the disposable four-cylinder economy car are over; move over Vega, you've been replaced by the Tempo.
