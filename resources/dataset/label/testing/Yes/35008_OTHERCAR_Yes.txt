            If you are looking for a car with low gas mileage, that will run without wear and tear for quite a while, is comfortable to drive and most of all, AFFORDABLE then this is the car for you!

About a few months ago, My fiance' and I adventured out to purchase a used car for me to drive to work and school. I was then driving his truck which he needed for work and he a ford probe (a standard that I was unable to drive.) So we figured it was time that we traded in and find a car that was comfortable for me to drive and that was more mine. 

We couldn't afford much,yet we still wanted to find something that would last. Both of us were very picky about what we would purchase. While at a local car dealer, we spotted a little white 1995 Mitsubishi Mirage that was low on miles (only 52,000), an automatic, and had been very well kept. After test driving it, I knew I HAD to have this car. It was a very smooth ride and very comfortable to drive (something you will find very rear for compacts). A tall person could still sit in this car and not be crammed; yet a short person (like me) could drive and not feel like your straining to reach for the petals. After purchasing the car at a price of $2,500 ($1,500 for a trade-in and an extra $500 down a total of $4,500), I brought my new pride and joy home. 

It has been about four months and I'm still not disappointed with this car. It has great gas mileage! I can go about a week on a tank of gas and filling it up is only about $15.00. It is still comfortable to drive and there have been no problems. There is very little maintenance besides the normal tuneups. The trunk is larger then normal for a compact car and extremely deep. I can fit a ton of groceries in it. Sure, I can't fit a large rake back there, but that is to be expected :-) 

I have already decided that if the car continues to live up to it's potential, that I will most defiantly purchase this model again. 

I recommend this car to anyone who doesn't have much to spend and that want's a small and reliable car.
