            I love this car!  There are two engine options-a 3.4l V6 and a 3.8l V6.  I chose the smaller engine for fuel efficiency.  It still has plenty of power.  Advertised fuel efficiency is 20 City and 32 Highway--I seem to average about 24mpg with most of my driving on the highway.  The Radio Data System tracks music by categories but requires the stations in your area to broadcast information about their format along with the music--most in my area do not so this is not a strong selling point.  The car is very comfortable and rides a lot smoother than the Lumina I just got rid of.  HUGE trunk space!

Two features I like a lot are 1) a warning system, tied into the ABS, that notifies the driver when tire pressure is low and 2)that the RDS will monitor oil life and notify you when you need an oil change via sensors that test the viscosity of the oil.<br><br>
