            The Escort ZX2 is quick, tight, dependable, fun to drive, affordable, and good looking. 

I purchased a ZX2 when they first came out in late 1997. I wanted something small, that would get good gas mileage, but yet still be quick off the line and fun to drive.  I bought my ZX2 and never looked back. I purchased a red ZX2 Hot, with the sport package, manual transmission. The Sport package included aluminum wheels and a rear spoiler.  Oh, about the Mustang comment, maybe its not that quick, but it won't leave you eating most other people's dust either.  

The exterior is sharp and unique from other cars in its class.  During the first few months of owning the car, I had numerous people asking me what kind of car it was, and falling over when I told them it was an Escort.

The interior is comfortable and controls are easy to reach and simple to use. Heater and A/C controls are easy to understand, and adjust while driving. Wiper and headlight controls are placed on steering wheel arm, where they are easy to reach without removing your hands from the steering wheel. Although easy to use, the universal control center used by Ford (the oval combination of the radio and header and a/c controls), does not provide an easy way to add after market radios or CD players. So my advice, but the CD player dealer installed (I didn't and regret it every time I have to play a cassette).

The engine is a work of art for its price range. The engine revs smoothly to red-line, and is plenty strong for the car's weight. Releasing the clutch and getting on the gas results in head jerking acceleration all the way to about 5000 RPMs where a shift is necessary. I have experienced 0-60 times in the 7 second range. The manual gear system is adequate, however I wish the linkage was a little tighter. I also don't understand why Ford skimped out and used a rubber shift boot instead of leather.

Over the past 2 years, the car has shown itself to be very reliable. Except for the occasional oil change and tire rotation, the car has never been in the shop. Although, that may change soon, as I have noticed that the braking mechanism has started to emit a annoying squeaking sound. But honestly, this is the only problem I have had.

Overall, I have been very pleased with the ZX2, and enjoy driving it very much on my 20 minute trek to and from work. I got a decent performance car, for a great price, that is really fun to drive. Would I buy it again? You bet'cha!
