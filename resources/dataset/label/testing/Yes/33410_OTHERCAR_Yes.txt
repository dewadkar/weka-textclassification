            The stylish and sporty look of the Jetta is what originally hooked me.  From the first minute I laid eyes on this fine automobile I knew I had to have one.  Perhaps my purchase was a bit impulsive but in this case it turned out to be the best purchase I have ever made.  

This car is a college guys dream.  A spacious trunk allows for plenty of dirty laundry to be brought to mom.  An excellent stereo system to make the long car trips go by faster.  And a look that drives the girls crazy.  

This car is the epitome of German engineering.  It is one of the smoothest cars I have ever had the pleasure of riding in.  And is definitely the nicest car I have had the pleasure of driving.   

The new Jetta is perfectly suited for the college student. It isn't too expensive but supplies a look that screams money.  However, why limit it to one age group.  Anyone who wants to have fun and drive an awesome car should go and at least test drive it. I am sure you will drive it home!!

One downfall to be careful of: Any passenger with long legs should be seated in the front seat.  There isn't a lot of leg room in the back!!<br><br>
