            Type-R.  Acura/Honda means serious business.  Why else would they strip 100 pounds of sound deadening material, hand build and port and polish the engine, put in seats that your butt will always stick in, shorten the ratios on the transmission, extend the duration and opening size of the intake/exhaust VTEC cam profile, use thicker body welds in the rear, put on tires that only last 5000 miles, put in a limited slip, and put on a really cool red valve cover?  Because they plan to WIN.  This car is unsurpassable. Actually that is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about my 2000 Type-R. This car is amazing. The interior is a custom Type-R, with red stiching in the seats. It also gets a special numbered plaque on the arm rest. The dash is a carbon fiber look alike, which looks cool. Now on to the fun stuff.

Turn the key, and alive comes a marvel of technology. The car produces 195 hp, at over 8,000 rpm. 8,000 rpm you might say? Well, to me it's music. And for any car enthusiast, it probably would be. It handles great; it can take a turn and you'll be stable the whole way through and say, &quot;I should have took that faster.&quot; The shifter is great, its WD-40 smooth and is short. To get the maximum performance, you have to pass 5,500rpm, so the VTEC cam profile opens up. But once this happens, it sounds like a completly different engine. Infact, it almost sounds like the car gets mad at you. Which is fine with me. The brakes in the car are great. They WILL stop on a dime. And they need to be that good when your approaching a corner at 120. Air conditioning is also STANDARD this year. The people over in Japan Honda also took out about 100 pounds of sound deadening material, which makes the car scream in the cabin. With is, once again, music to my ears. They put in a Limited Slip Differential, bigger brakes, improved cams, valves, and a bigger throttle body. The car is completly performance geared. 

One of my complaints about this car is the price. For what I paid, I could have gotten a Z28. But, a Z28 can't handle corners like a Type - R can. But then, a Type - R can't give you the &quot;push you in your seat feels like your on a roller coaster&quot; like acceleration. The ride is also kind of harsh, but not too much. But ride is something I can sacrifice for the type of handling this car can take. Another thing is the lack of torque below the VTEC cam profile. Under it, it drives like any other 4 cylinder small car. But remember, past 4,500 rpm the car enters a class all alone. The car also needs premium gas, and here its $1.60 a gallon.. The cup holders are also junk. I can't even fit a McDonalds coffee in it. This car is my daily driver.... And the lack of cup holding capability is somewhat annoying. The car lacks luxury items, such as cruse control and a sun roof. One more complaint about this car are the tires. It states in the manual, &quot;The unique high performance tires on the vehicle are not designed for winter driving.&quot; Funny, cause I got the car in December, and they were right. So far, I try not to take it out when it snows. If I get off the clutch a little, and with NO gas, the tires will still spin and loose traction. One more problem with the tires... It also states that they won't last more than 10,000 miles. Infact, it says SIGNIFICANTLY less than 10,000 miles. I just don't feel like dishing out another $500 for some new tires so soon. When the times comes, I guess I'll be putting on some M+S Dunlops or something that last a lot longer than the Bridgestones. But the Bridgestones do stick to the pavement like flies on sugar. 

This car is probably ONLY for performance enthusiasts. It also only comes with a 5 speed manual. Lookin for a automatic, look somewhere else. The ride is probably one that only a performance enthusiast would put up with. 

The car compares with the new 2000 Toyota Celica, which I think is a nicely redesigned car. But I stuck with the Acura because I think it just looks better, and the higher 8,400 rpm redline just sealed the envelope. I needed to get it. The Type - R is also faster than the Celica, through all fields. 

I love my Type - R, and I am happy I bought this instead of a Z28 or a Celica. The complaints I listed above are only minor, complaints that i can handle and live with. I have no serious complaints about this car. I would have to say this is the most close to perfect car I have ever seen. Some may think this is a stretch, but hey, thats just my opinion. If I actually was offered a Vette or the Type - R, call me crazy but I would pick the Type - R. Acura really scored with this car. And I'm lucky enough to own one.

I own a 2000 Type - R, but the only thing Acura changed from the 97 - 98 models is they put in air conditioning standard and changed from championship white to phoenix yellow and pearl black.<br><br>
