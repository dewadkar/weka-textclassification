            I will skip all the official general info on the car since it has nothing to do with my opinion or experience with the car.

I've owned the car for about 2.5 years now and have enjoyed (almost) trouble-free performance from it. The car has over 130,000 KM on it now, yet it feels nearly as tight and solid as a 98 328 I test-drove recently. The engine remains strong and the clutch/transmission have been flawless. The interior stands up pretty well and does not look/feel old and worn, unlike many other vehicles of this age(and I don't just mean domestics - those are not classified as vehicles in my book).

My favorite aspect of the car is the driving feel - the overall combination of handling, clutch/shifter feel and many other details like pedal placement and throttle response. The only other cars that in my opinion are in the same league or better are BMW M3 (of course) and Porsche 911. I have driven many cars that are faster, will corner at higher speeds, stop quicker, etc., but none had quite the same overall feel.

Some service advice - stick to original BMW parts for critical components suck as brake rotors/pads, etc. - I found that after-market items might seemingly save you some money, but do not last/perform as well as the original parts. Service is usually considered to be very expensive on BMW, but I found that it has been cheaper to maintain my 325 than an Integra I owned before. Example - clutch replacement on the 325 - $549.00 (Can) parts and labor, clutch replacement on the Integra - $800.00 parts and labor. This is not to say that certain items are not blown out of proportion - replacement fog-light lenses are $125.00 (Can) EACH(!!!), but the major items have been pretty reasonable in my opinion. And many small but pleasant things that I love are:
1. Auto-up AND down on BOTH windows - it isn't all the difficult to do, so why isn't everyone doing it?
2. Full-size spare tire - let's face it the so called &quot;space-saver&quot; doesn't ACTUALLY save all that much space.
3. Trunk-mounted battery - helps weight distribution and makes a nice stereo install easier and more efficient.

What do I hate about it? 
1. BMW stock wheels for one - toss those for a nice set of &quot;Racing Dynamics&quot; or &quot;AC Schnitzer&quot; 17&quot; or 18&quot; wheels and you are in business.
2. Performance (yeah right) in the snow - all I can say is TAKE A CAB! 
3. Rear seats' (lack of) room could be a concern for some people, but then they should be looking at the 4 door anyway. 
4. The top speed limiter is quite unnecessary in my opinion - although most people should be satisfied with 207KM/H. 
5. Absolutely worthless stock stereo system - waste of space, money, and time - get rid of it as soon as you can.

Who should drive this car? Anyone who values finesse over raw power (mind you those people are probably learning to read right now just so they can read the new Mustang Cobra R or a Z28 review), and enjoys the driving experience itself, NOT just the speed accomplished.

Who shouldn't? All the arrogant pricks that buy BMW's to look cool and impress chicks - go buy a 318ti automatic instead, at least you won't have to look stupid stalling it at every intersection.
