            Two weeks ago I found out that I was pregnant with my 3rd child.  My other kids are both in car seats.  We wanted a small Minivan that would easily fit 3 car seats, a booster, regular and infant seat.  The Mazda MPV was our answer.

The Mazda MPV is one of the smaller minivans around.  We did not want something too big and was definitely on a budget. MPVs seat seven.  It has a 200 hp 3.0 liter V6 and a 5-speed automatic transmission. ABS is standard.  The LX now has 16-inch alloy wheels. 

These are my favorite features:

1.  Sliding side doors - There are sliding doors on both sides of the minivan.  They are available with power, but we did not get this option.  Our driveway is steep so the door locks come in handy if you back in the driveway.  You don't have to worry about the door sliding back onto you while getting the kids out.  Windows on the sliding doors go down!  Try finding this on another minivan.

2.  Seats - The 2nd row bucket seats can slide together to create a 2-passenger bench.  If the kids behave they can sit together, otherwise just move them apart.  The 3 seat 3rd row bench folds into the floor. A cool feature of the 3rd row is that it can flip to create rear-facing tailgate party seating. Great for soccer games!  There is a built in tether behind the second row seats so car seats can easily be secured.  The cushions are comfortable in the 2nd row, but 3rd row is more flat.

3. Fuel economy - MPV averages 22 mpg . Mazda recommends regular-grade fuel.

4. Storage space - The MPV has a well on the rear floor.  It is the place where the third seat can go into.  This is great for grocery shopping.  Mazda also put bag clips on the sides so you can secure your packages.  The rear fit 2 seats when on an adventure with a friend.  For long trips we have a Tulle cargo box for the top of the van.  If you only need the middle seats you can put the rear seat down for extra storage space.

5. Other - I like the position of the gauges.  There is a volume control on the steering wheel.  The car mats were included.  Single CD player sounds great.  Sporty look.

There are a couple areas for improvement.  3rd row seats could be more comfortable.  Getting to the 3rd row requires a little maneuvering if there are 2 car seats in the second row.

Since I have only driven this for a week I will come back in a month and update you with some other features or areas for improvement.  Based on the last 2 weeks this is a great minivan.
