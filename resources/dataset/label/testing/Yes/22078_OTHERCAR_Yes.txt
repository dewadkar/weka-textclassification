            My hubby surprised me last year and bought me this digital camera! I could not believe my eyes! It is so easy to use and it is self explanitory. I like how it gives you the option to do whatever you want to do with the picture and if you don't like the picture you can delete it and do it over. No more buying film!! I can now develope my own pictures and put them on my hard drive. Once they are on my hard drive, I can delete them off of the memory card that is in the camera and start all over again with some more pictures. It is so much fun to use!<br><br>
