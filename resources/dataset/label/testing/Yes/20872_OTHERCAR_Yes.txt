            Recently I was in California for my wife's sister's wedding.  We had planned this trip for a while and had pre-booked and prepaid everything.  Things didn't always go as we planned but overall it was a fun trip. (Fun trip = spending more money than you planned)

We found out that our flight to LAX had been canceled for no apparent reason.  My wife, thinking ahead, immediately called the rental car agency and informed them of our dilemma.  They told us that they would hold our reservation for an extra couple hours.  

We finally arrived in LAX after  various delays and managed to get to the car rental agency from one of their vans. (We used Thrifty)(F.Y.I.)  After waiting in line for about 45 minutes, we realized that we had gone past the deadline given to us by Thrifty.  Alas, when we got to the rental counter, the sweet little convertible that we had reserved had been rented.

My wife is not an understanding woman.  It was after midnight, we were hungry, tired, and we had a long drive ahead of us.  She gave me the &quot;JEFFREY! DO SOMETHING!&quot; Look. (A look that I know well.)  So when the man behind the counter offered us a <b>2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser</b> for only $50 a day (usually priced at $80 a day), I accepted.  I figured that it would be something that I could write a good review about on Epinions, and lo and behold, here I am.

First look.  Yep,,,I gotta say that it is a sharp looking vehicle.  We had the <i>Limited Edition</i> version which had ALL the bells and whistles.  Chrome wheels, leather seats, keyless entry and only 1200 miles.  

We stowed our luggage and began our little journey in style.  We encountered our first problem leaving the garage.  We needed to roll the windows down to give the man our ticket stub, but we couldn't find the power window button.  The man anticipated our frantic pawing, and pointed to the middle of the dash above the climate controls.  My wife and I both thought this was a strange place to put window controls, but sure enough, they were there.

We managed to make it out on the highway heading south towards Oxnard (our final destination) when we suddenly realized that Oxnard was NORTH of L.A., not south.  So we turned around and headed north.  One thing about California.  The drivers there like their speed.  We were routinely doing 80-90 mph just keeping up with traffic.  The four cylinder engine in the PT Cruiser did not really like that too much. (Especially with the A/C running, like my wife always insists upon).  This baby could use a V-6.  That's what I'm talking about!  This would be a sweet little hot rod if Chrysler dropped the V-6 from the 300M model into it. 

We made it to Oxnard with no problems, though I did notice a couple of things.  The PT Cruiser is a thirsty little car.  We weren't really hot-rodding it (even though we were driving 80 mph sometimes) but we would only get about 23-25 mpg on the highway.  For a four cylinder engine, that isn't very good. (Especially a brand new one.)  Another thing I noticed is the head rests on the seats.  The drivers and passengers head rests are quite comfortable, however, on the back seats they tend to block your vision, so backing up can be rather tricky.

All in all, the ride was quite smooth and quiet.  The seats were leather (I love leather, my wife doesn't) and comfortable.  Controls were ergonomically placed, though after driving a Honda and Acura for a while, you tend to think that buttons are where they aren't.

Overall my wife and I enjoyed our little four day rental of the PT Cruiser.  It is a sharp looking, comfortable, scoot-around-town car.  It isn't a racer, it is....simply a Cruiser.  <br><br>
