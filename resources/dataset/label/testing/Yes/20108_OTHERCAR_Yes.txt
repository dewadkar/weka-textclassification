            What more can be said?  The automotive press and true driving enthusiasts know that if you want a Porsche-meets-Mercedes, the ONLY choice is BMW M division products.  Case in point, a 400-HP, 4-door, leather lined/luxury imbued sedan with a 6 speed MANUAL!  No automatic slush box here.  Too bad Mercedes and Audi and Jaguar just don't get it.......

The BMW M5 hands down is the fastest, best handling, and most superbly engineered super sedan in the world.  Even in the cash rich Silicon Valley, it never fails to turn heads.  While Porsches and Ferraris are outstanding sports cars in their own right, they don't posses the day-to-day driveability and reliability that make an M5 a practical super car.  BMW has mastered the paradoxical delivery of luxury and performance.

As a proud owner of one, I can tell you it is an incredible experience to have a car that can keep up with traditional super cars in handling and acceleration and negate the fact that this car ways 4,000 pounds!  The standard features like a navigation system, DSP audio system, and power everything is matched by meticulous assembly and fit and finish........all this with the reliability and ride quality of the standard 5 Series......and I thought my M3 was hot.

Alas though, this pure satisfaction comes at a hefty surcharge by many dealers who take advantage of both the high demand and exclusivity that an M5 delivers.  BMW should try to thwart these excessive greed practices.<br><br>
