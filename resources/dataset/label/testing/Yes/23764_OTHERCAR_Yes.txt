              I currently own a '92 Saturn SL.  This cute little car is very fun to drive.  It has a very unique look (though I live in a college town where I see quite a few Saturns running around.).  It has over 200,000 miles on it (though they are not all mine), and it still drives like new.  I am actually at 213,000 and counting.  The extent of its current difficulties is a minor emissions problem...nothing more than regular wear and tear.  For the quality, this car is extremely inexpensive.  It is also relatively dent free.  I believe that there are some small spots of hail damage on the roof, but that isn't much considering the bumps from car doors and the like that it has managed to put up with.

  However, i do hate the automatic seat belts, but those become easy to ignore.  I must mention, though, that my biggest piece of advice for anyone buying a Saturn, especially older models, is to get a twin-cam.  Mine is but a single cam, and if it weren't for the spunkiness of a manual transmission, it would have no power at all.  The transmission give me enough to get up and go, but it does bog down horribly with the A/C on.  

  All of those problems go away when I fill up with gas.  City driving, which includes gunning it to pull out onto a busy 55 mph city road, come out to be between 29 and 30 miles per gallon.  The transmission shifts rather smoothly.  The A/C, though it bogs the car down, blows out pretty cold.  I have fold-down seats that give easy access to the trunk, which has plenty of space for two golf bags and lots of other garbage.  This car is wonderful for those on a budget, such as college students.  It feels very good to say, "I drive a Saturn."

********UPDATE JUNE 20, 2001

Well, today I trade in "Bert" for a 1996 Civic Coupe EX.  At 225,000 miles, this car has treated me well.  Though it wasn't an gorgeous high-priced eye-catcher, this car has been good for a struggling college student.  Recently, the synchronizer for 2nd gear went bad, so I've spent the last couple months skipping from 1st to 3rd...of course, something like that was bound to happen with so many miles.  So, before the miles catch up with the car, I'll be trading it in.  Hopefully, I will soon have a new epinion on my new car.
