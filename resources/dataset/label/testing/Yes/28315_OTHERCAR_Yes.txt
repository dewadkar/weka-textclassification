            Hey, before you read I'm not interested in 'brownie' points for an essay - but just think it important we all exchange information honestly across Continents on basically the same cars from the same manufacturers. I have put my 96 model here in the 94s as I could not work out how to start a new year section! Here in Britain it's called a Vauxhall Frontera. Have owned since October 1998. The power unit is a single ohc 2-litre. Faults: exhaust needed replacing early due to bad design. Too much rear legroom and not enough behind rear seat. Just (2001) needed new battery. Very easy to work on - no mysteries, cheap spares. Returns about 24-30 mpg (20 mpg when towing a 16ft caravan). Great image - always gets noticed. More reliable than Landrover products though not as good off road as a Range Rover or Defender. Silly removable 'moon roof' panel too big to store in car/back removable window can leak. Believe a temporary folding roof cover available here but over ï¿½100! Post 1995 models prone to faults and also have rear leaf springs. Coil springs all round from late 1995 (would advise against buying rear leaf sprung models) plus improved Bosch electrics. Mine has Auto-lock hubs (stop, engage 4WD. Disengage: stop, select 2WD, reverse a metre to disengage). Post 98 models shift on the move which is easier but in my opinion encourages use of 4x4 when not necessary thus causing wear in wrong hands. Excellent 6-speaker stereo with deep bass frequency for rock enthusiasts (or Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos). Now being greatly outsold as a fashion accessory to visit Sainsburys and Tescos by the Freelander - but a much better off roader for those wanting the real gear. Believe you can buy it in the States as just a 2WD !! (WHY?) Also produced here as pickup and crew cab. Widely used by main UK breakdown service - the Automobile Association - so not a bad reference eh? Made in UK at GM's plant at Luton - originally delivered in bits from Japan to be mated with European engines (not always successfully). Now all made at Ellesmere Port near Liverpool. UK Engine sizes now from 2.2 Ecotec to V6. Widely marketed as Opel Campo (mainland Europe), Isuzu MU (Japan), Holden Frontera (quite a popular Aussie outback machine loaded with 'roo'-bars, lamps, wide tyres etc.)   We also own a 97 LWB Suzuki Vitara (Sidekick). See a really great 4x4 site:  www.difflock.com    Best Wishes to you all in 2002.
