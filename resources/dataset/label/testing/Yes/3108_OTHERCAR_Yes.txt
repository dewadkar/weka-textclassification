            At the end of May, I purchased a 5 speed Hyundai Elantra - model year 2000. Exactly 2 months and about 4,500 miles later ( I do a lot of driving ) as I was turning through an intersection, a man in a pickup truck drove through a red light and into the rear passenger side of my car.  I was upset, but unhurt.  My car however spent 45 days in the shop and I spent 45 days (about 3,000 miles) in a rental car.  Iï¿½m sure you have already guessed, based on the tittle of this epinion, that my rental car was a 2000 Ford Escort.  This article will highlight the differences that I found between the two vehicles.

First of all, I should point out that the Escort I rented has an automatic transmission.  This contributed to one of the major differences between the cars.  Although the two cars have similar engines (4 cylinder, 16 valve, 2.0 liter), I believe the Elantra has a little more horsepower and torque.  This is really noticeable on hills and while trying to accelerate on the highway.  Having been driving a manual 5 speed for 2 months, switching to the automatic was a little difficult.  I would recommend a manual to anyone who does not live in a city or deal with heavy traffic on a daily basis. (it took me 2 hours to learn and a week to master)  Either way, the Elantra wins in my book for overall power.  The 0-60 time and highway-passing pick-up were far superior to the Escort.

The second largest difference between the two cars that I found was the interior size.   Although both cars offer similar square footage, the cockpit in the Escort is a little cramped.  I am a rather large man, 6 foot and about 250lbs, and although I fit in the Escort, I found my legs constantly knocking the center console/gear shift and the door.  Even with the seat pushed back all the way, I could steer the car with my knees. Even though the Elantra is in the same class for size, I believe it has a better interior design.  The center console/gear box is lower, as is the seat, which gives more leg room and nothing to knock your knees into.  If the Escort had been a manual transmission, I would not have had the room to shift.  Other then leg room, both cars have an equal seat size.  Comfortable for the first hour or so of driving, I found myself having to remove my wallet and other items in my pockets after time to keep from getting sore. 

Since rental companies are inherently cheap, the Escort I rented had little or no options.  Some of the major creature comforts I missed that come standard with EVERY Elantra were:
power windows
power locks
duel power mirrors
AIR CONDITIONER 
cool spring-loaded cup holders
driver and passenger map lights
trunk and gas release levers
and some other little details, like: break away side mirrors that are also the same color as the car - not black.  
These features all come standard with the basic model of the Elantra.  The Escort I rented did not even have floor mats. (Although, that is due to the cheapness of the rental company)

As for gas mileage - I have never been able to reach the 30+ m/gallon advertised by both car companies.  I drive fast and hard, so thats probably a big factor.  I didn't keep acurate details with the rental but I think I got an extra 20 miles to the tank with it.
