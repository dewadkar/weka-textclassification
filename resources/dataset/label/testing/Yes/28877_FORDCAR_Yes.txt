            The ford explorer... one of the best vehicles on today's market.  this all weather sports utility vehicle is 4 wheel drive and ready to plow through any type of weather conditions.  i have leased 2 explorers over the past 3 years and i can be the first to tell you that they handle great.  i am 6 foot 4 and i have more leg room than i know what to do with.  with state of the art electronics inside this suv is just like icing on the cake.  Without question, i recommend the ford explorer to anyone who wants nothing less than the best. If you think i write a halfway decent reveiw and you agree with my opinions on products dont be afraid to give me an email at Prizice24@aol.com and also dont be afraid to check out my account and look at some of my other opinions. <br><br>
