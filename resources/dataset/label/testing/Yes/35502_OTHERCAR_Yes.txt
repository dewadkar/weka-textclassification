            My 1999 EX is my first venture into the world of minivans, and it won't be my last.  Actually, it's great!  Everyone in our family loves our first Honda.  It's roomy, comfortable, quiet, and maintenance-free in the first 9 months I've had it.  The captain's chairs in the middle are quite comfortable and the option to scoot them next to each other and keep them separated has come in handy with caring for the baby (scooted in) and limiting sibling rivalry (spread apart).  The disappearing back seat is a dream come true.  

One of our favorite things is the flip over back seat - instant tailgate party!  It even has a power source at the very back of the van.  The 9 cup holders are a great feature also.

The only thing I would change is the quality of the sound system, and perhaps the speed of the automatic side doors.

Hopefully the difficult wait to actually get one of these popular vans will improve, because I know in a few years I'll want a new one.
