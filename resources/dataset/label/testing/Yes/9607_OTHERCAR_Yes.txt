            I had a 2000 Celica for 15 months and although I nearly lost my license twice driving the car, it was the best fun I have had in a very long time.

In Australia, we import the high powered Japanese models with VVTL-i.  These output about 140Kw of power,180Nm of torque, and have a 6 speed manual gearbox.  With this much power from a car that weighs just over one tonne, its not about getting from A to B but how quickly you get there.

The car drives and handles beautifully.  I drove it both in the city and along tight country roads.  Never once did the car lose grip.  It feels like you are riding in a go kart but just a lot more comfortably.

You can easily tour with this car.  The seats are great to sit in, both for short and long distances.  Sound system is great, though if I still had the car, I probably would have fitted a sub woofer.

The dash and consoles have been designed to mimic a cockpit with the driver and passenger seats separated by the centre console.  

The gearbox is one of the easiest manuals that I have had.  You can rest your arm on the centre console and flick the gears up and down.  It is that easy.

Overall this was a great car to drive.  The only reason I got rid of it was that I kept getting pulled over by our friends in blue.  Other than that, this car is both reliable and a lot of fun to drive
