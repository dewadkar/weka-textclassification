            I have had my D600L for almost two years and have taken thousands of pictures with it.  To me, the picture quality is absolutely amazing, even in low light situations (if you use a tripod or have a very steady hand).  I have made 11 x 17 enlargements of some of my pictures through a Cannon color laser copier and framed them.  Most eyes would not be able to tell them apart from film pictures printed on photographic paper.

The main problem with the camera that I have found is its auto focus.  Sometimes it gets totally confused and can't focus - more times than you would expect.  This has caused me to miss a LOT of shots when the darn thing just couldn't focus - even after several tries.  Of all things, the auto focus seems to have the most problem with skin tones, which is really bad if you take pictures of people.  DUH.  You have to learn to focus on something else about the same distance away, then swing the camera back to your subject to take the shot.  Not a very good way to take pictures.

In spite of its larger than average size (this is not a pocket camera, believe me) it is very comfortable to hold and operate.  It fits perfectly in your hands.  It has a lot of other nice features, more than I can mention here.

Other than that, I have never had a bit of trouble with it and after two years of continuous use, it still works like new.<br><br>
