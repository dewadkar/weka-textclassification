            I bought my Tahoe used, its got 100k+ miles on it and it still runs like a dream.  I've got the fully loaded LX model (leather, cd, electric everything etc.)

The first thing I noticed about the Tahoe is the immense amount of room.  I knew it was bigger than my old Bronco, but Geez!  I can take 4 passengers easy, and probably upwards of 6 if I were to compromise comfort. 

The Tahoe has tons of extras, like a compass on the rear view mirror, compartments for sunglasses, kleenex, etc.  

As far as the ride, it is a really solid plush feeling vehicle.  The view from the Tahoe is supurb, and definite "King of Road" feeling is found when driving.  

The negatives are there as well though.  I'll start with some minor ones.  The cup holder is right in front of an a/c vent.  That was poor planning.  Mine has some rattles, yes it's a '95, but they are definitely there.  

A little more important now is the issue of gas mileage.  I get about 14mpg.  Which really....what do you expect?  It is a huge vehicle with a V8.  I was pleasantly surprised actually, I was counting on the worst, so 14 was doable.
The power of the V8 is a little disappointing.  It's no wussie by any means, but it doesn't really get up and go like I was expecting.  It is big, that may have something to do with it.  I haven't towed anything with it yet, but I don't think it would be a problem. Torque doesn't seem to be the problem, it's more like when you are on the freeway wanting to kick it up to 75 from 65.  It just doesn't jump like you want it to.

Reliability has been a definite plus for the Tahoe.  Not one problem in 6 months.  Take care of it and it will take care of you.
