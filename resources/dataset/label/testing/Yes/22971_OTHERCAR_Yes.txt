            If you're interested in buying a digital camera but you have a limited budget, this could be the one.  The Polaroid PDC640 is relatively cheap.  It's also easy to use and the photographs are of good quality.  

Let me explain how it works.  The camera runs on batteries but is lightweight and looks just like a regular camera (except for a few features which I will explain further below).  To turn it on, you simply open the shutter and press the button on top.  

Once you turn the camera on, there are a few settings that you can choose from.  For example, you can select settings depending on how close you are to your subject.  The camera also allows you to choose between Auto flash or a continuous flash (the flashbulb goes off everytime you take a picture).  

That's basically it.  Then you point and click.  Again, just like a regular camera. 

But after you take the photo, forget everything you know about regular photography because the process is completely different.  Gone are the days of dropping your film off at Fotomat and crossing your fingers in hopes that the shots you took came out. 

There is a small screen on the back of the camera which allows you to instantaneously see what the photo you took looks like.  That is something I really enjoy.  I've never really been one to carry a camera around, but I love taking this one with me because it's so quick and easy and there's no suspense in waiting to find out how pictures look.  And if I don't like a picture, I can simply delete it and retake it.  

Also different is the fact that there is no film to process.  Just simply hook up your camera (I won't explain how, but it's very quick and easy) to your computer and download the images using the software that's included with the camera.  (Incidentally, everything you need to take photos and upload them to the computer is included with this camera, so there are no surprises when you get home from the store.)  

When you're looking at the photos on the computer screen, you have many options.  If a picture is too dark, you can lighten it.  I took a picture of my son at the train station after he got back from NY.  There was a big shadow across half of his face, but the software let me lighten it on the computer in seconds.  If it had been a regular photo I would have been upset because it was the only shot I had of him at the station and it was special to me because I hadn't seen him in a month.  Fortunately, since it was digital, I was able to salvage the picture. 

You can also learn to do tons of other stuff.  For example, you can &quot;crop&quot; your photos.  This process basically allows you to select a portion of the photo.  For example, I took a picture of a house from my car (I'm moving and it was one of the houses I was interested in).  The passenger side mirror was in the photo.  On the computer, I simply cropped the photo to get rid of the mirror.  

You can also do fun stuff that involves digitally manipulating your photographs in a more complex way.  For example, you can take your face from a photograph and superimpose it on a photo of the Statue of Liberty.  

If you want to print your pictures out, there is special paper available at many stores (including K-mart) that will make the quality of your pictures look even more like a traditional picture.  

Overall, I would have to say that the quality of this camera is very good.  In fact, I spoke to a communications professor with much experience in digital photography and after looking at my camera he jokingly said I shouldn't tell people that I got my camera from Walmart (which is where I purchased it -- for $169).  He said it was a nice enough piece of equipment that I could probably get away with saying that I ordered it from some special digital photography company.  

At any rate, it's a lot of fun.  There are so many things that can be done with this camera, in the few weeks that I've owned it, I feel I've barely scratched the surface.
