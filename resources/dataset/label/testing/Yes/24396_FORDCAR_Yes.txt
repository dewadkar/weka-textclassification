            The 1996 Ford Escort has served me very well, even though i have put it through a lot of abuse. I am only 17 years old, and my mom and dad presented me to a used 1996 Ford Escort LX 2 door hatchback on my 16th birthday. It was a great looking little car. Toreador red metallic paint, grey interior, and it was spotless. It wasn't my first choice of car, and it still isn't. I originally wanted the 1996 Ford Escort GT I had spotted in a local dealership, but my dad thought I should have this instead. I have the 1.9L engine in my car, which originally was gutless, but I of course modified it. It reacted quite well to the K&amp;N air filter kit. It still gets about 30 miles to the gallon, and I had an accident with it recently. I slid into a telephone pole when I went out in the snow. But I have new tires now, so it works out rather well. Thank you for reading my report. I still baby my car, and i hope you take care of yours.<br><br>
