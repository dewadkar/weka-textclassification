            My husband and I were fed up with driving a Geo Storm with 2 kids under the age of two. We went everywhere looking for someone to help get us into a decent family sized car with payments we could afford.
 Our car dealer had us look at a 1995 Ford Windstar. We had always wanted a van but knew it was a long way off,as we were a one-income family. It was love at first sight. Our Windstar has a remote entry security system,and 2 captains chairs that fit car seats beautifully. And there is even a 3 seat bench in the back.
 We can now sit comfortably and safetly,and know that out children are doing the same as well. Driving the van was a major adjustment though,having only driven cars. It sits high up,which is a plus,and the seats in our van have an inflatable back rest/support system in the driver and passenger seats! What a plus,especially for people who have bad backs or need extra back support as my husband does. 
There is nothing I hate about this van. I think that people who are looking for a good family vehicle,with safety and comfort in mind should definatly look for a Ford Windstar. <br><br>
