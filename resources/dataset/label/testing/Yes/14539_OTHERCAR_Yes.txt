            We bought a Mazda Protege '91. It was our first new car ever.
We were very impresses at how little it cost compared to all this car had.
Of course we were happy to have a new car too. But it came with some extras that were nice. Air conditioning and a cassette player.
This little car ran great from day one and we never had a problem getting it to start. 
The backseat was roomy enough for three people and had ample leg room.
Also it was very easy to install our carseat into.
We finally ran up over 100,000 miles on the car so we decided to trade it in,we needed a minivan anyway.
It was sad to have to do,we actually still talk about this car.
It was a great car and ran wonderfully. I admit we didn't always take it in for a tune up when we needed one or got the oil changed and this car still ran great.<br><br>
