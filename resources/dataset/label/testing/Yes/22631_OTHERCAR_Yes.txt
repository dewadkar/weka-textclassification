            Read bobhilt's review- it is excellent and informative.  I just picked up a 5 speed hybrid and am very pleased with it. I did not research this car- it was an almost-impulse buy.  We researched a lot of other less expensive cars for a new car for my wife to commute to work in.  We were about to buy an Echo (nice car, I think)when I suggested we take a look at the Hybrid out of curiosity.  To my surprise, my wife loved it and we ordered a 5 speed almost before we even knew what the car was about.

This is a car that people either love or are intensely indifferent to.  Nothing flashy about it- it looks like a standard civic.  But that's its virtue as well.  I applaud Honda for taking such a popular car and making the hybrid power plant effectively an "option."  

The car costs a couple thousand more than a civic and currently is selling for around list price (that may change).  The gas mileage is terrific but not enough to offset the additional cost.  So why buy it?  It makes you feel good to drive this car.  Not only is it a new technology that is cool in and of itself, it saves gas and has very low emissions.  My favorite feature is the auto stop where the engine shuts off under certain conditions when you come to a stop.  Like the previous post, within a day, I couldn't understand why every car didn't have this gas saving/air-saving technology (and I am hardly an environmentalist).  I look at cars around me in lines at the bank and think "What a waste.  Shut off your engines and let me breathe!"

Performance is only OK, but no one would buy this car for that reason.  The electric assist is very good at torque so acceleration is fine from a standing start.  What is so interesting about the Hybrid is that it changes the way you look at driving.  I like the 5 speed because it keeps me more connected to the car, but you start to drive in order to keep the mpg indicator as high as possible and that honestly becomes as much fun as more conventional forms of driving.  Really.  This may wear off in time but so does the pleasure associated with any vehicle (that's why they keep changing them)and at least you continue to get great mileage and pollute less.

I hope Honda sells scads of these cars.  Americans almost seem to take a perverse pleasure in trashing the environment and its time to stop.  With this car you can make that statement without being weird.  Save your weirdness for other things...
