            UPDATE 3/5/2001
I have since owned my Sentra for almost 2 years now, I have 18,000 miles on it and since made quite a few modifications to it to spice things up.  I rarely update my reviews (actually this is the firs time), but I feel this is very important.  I mentioned in my old review that the Civic SI has a better engine than the Sentra SE-L.  I would like to retract this statement.  After understanding the two engines, and the POWER of my car, I have come to realize these 2 cars are equals.  But I would put money on my car everytime, and here's why.

The Sentra's engine, the SR20DE is a very STRONG engine.  The power band for this car is very very good.  It means if you are driving, from 1-6500RPM you will generate MORE power than the Civic SI.  The SI only has the edge when the car is over 6500RPM.  And even then it is not that much.  Therefore, the Sentra has a MUCH MORE useable power band, because you rarely Rev your car to such a high RPM.  And when racing, the Sentra will beat the Civic off the line everytime, because before the VTEC kicks in, the Civic is only making about 120hp.  And you will pound him until his VTEC kicks in and starts playing catch up.  And unless it is a straight-away, and the Civic doesn't need to slow down, the Sentra will win everytime.  Just my humble opinion.

Original Epinion:
     It being my first vehicle, I spent a lot of time researching, comparing, and test driving the vehicles that are on my list.  My budget was around 17,000 dollars and I narrowed my selection down to a Japanese Sedan.  My choices were the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Mitsubishi Mirage, Subaru Impreza, Mazda Protege, and Nissan Sentra.  My choice was further narrowed when the availability of a nearby dealership would be available for future check-ups, warranty repairs, etc.  So my list became :

Toyota Corrola 
Nissan Sentra SE-Limtied
Impreza RS

   I understand that the Impreza RS was out of my price range, but being in a cold climate, the AWD proved to come in handy.

  After test driving and reviewing the three vehicles, the Corolla's lack of power and dull design was my cause for eliminating this vehicle. (Also, Toyota cars have a weird catback that extrudes from the bottom of the car).  The Impreza RS having 160HP in a flat 4 cynlinder engine, with AWD corning abilities was a blast to drive, however the interior was cramped, upholstry was cheap, and insurance was very high (they didn't have the 4 door in 1999).  The Sentra has a 2.0 liter I-4 Engine which is very comparible to the RS since it has a lighter body.  The new fascia and Limited attributes such as titanium tinted wheels, gauge, 15 inch wheels, front-rear disc breaks, and much more makes it a super Sentra.  As a matter of fact, many people might need to have a second look at this car before they realize its actually a sentra.

  Other benefits about this car is its incredible support in the front driver and passenger seats, great ride for a compact, and ample space.  The negatives are the weird position of the cup holders, a ridiculously long shifter on the Manual Models, and a weak engine despite the 2.0 (my opinion after driving a 210hp V6 Diamante for 2 years).  

   I would greatly recommend this car to anyone who needs a reliable car that can really take go.  The 2.0liter Engine 140HP is better than the Mazda Protege, Toyota Corolla, and Civics except the Si.  The insurance is not bad, and you really think you are driving a much larger car than it appears.  With the sporty additions that the SE-Limted provides such as remote entry, moon roof, anti lock breaks, and Double Din Cassette/CD player, I think it's a great value.  You can get all this for around $16,000 if not less (excluding licensing and tax).
