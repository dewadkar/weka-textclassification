            GMC knows how to make a solid, powerful vehicle, and the Safari is an excellent example. The 1993 GMC Safari SLE extended passenger van has served as our general-purpose family vehicle for almost a year now, and we love it. 

My squeeze had a hard time talking me into letting him buy himself a Safari. &quot;It's a minivan,&quot; I said. &quot;I refuse to be one of those minivan moms.&quot; 

&quot;It's not a minivan,&quot; he insisted. &quot;It's a GMC truck.&quot; We argued for close to a year about this. I wanted him to get a Volvo wagon. In the end, I gave up, and I think it was the very next day when he came home with the Safari. 

With driver and front passenger captain's chairs, and two full bench seats, the Safari provides comfortable seating for 8 adults. I think we'd had it for two weeks when we took it to the airport to pick up my entire family and their luggage. It was perfectly comfortable with 5 adults and two children in car seats, along with all the baggage in the rear cargo area. We could even have carried another person and more suitcases. 

Both bench seats are removable, and with them out, the cargo space in the Safari is astonishing. We've hauled tons of stuff to the dump (literally), large and cumbersome objects, enough lumber to complete good-sized projects, an entire set of patio furniture (half of which was assembled). And -- this is where my squeeze proves to be right that it's a GMC truck -- with a ton of lumber in the back, and the doors closed, you can't look at the van and tell it's heavily laden, nor does it struggle to haul the weight. In fact, according to GMC, the rear-wheel drive Safari can trailer about 3 tons.

The Safari boasts what I believe is the largest V6 engine around, 4.2 liters of displacement turning out around 200 horsepower with more low-end torque than many pickup trucks. Why a V6 and not a V8? Well, probably because you can fit a V6 in a smaller space, creating less impact on the passenger area. 

Amusingly, my squeeze has used the rear-wheel drive Safari to liberate someone's 4-wheel drive SUV that was stuck in the mud. It does not lack for power or traction.

The Safari is definitely the best all-purpose vehicle I've made use of. That said, it's probably not for everyone. I wouldn't pick it for my daily driver, but that's primarily because the cars I have picked to be my daily drivers have been a Mazda RX-7 and a Pontiac Trans Am, and that's the kind of thing I want to drive around. If I were picking between a Safari for a daily driver, and any of the minivans or SUVs on the market, the Safari would win hands down. 

Make no bones about it, however, the Safari is a big vehicle. Therefore, it drives like a big vehicle. It's much easier to handle than something like a Ford Econoline van, to be sure, but where every minivan I've driven basically handled like a car, the Safari handles like a truck. However, it handles like a really good truck. As compared to a Chevy Blazer, for example, the Safari is far superior in pickup, steering, cornering, and braking, and feels more solid on the road. Visibility is also excellent, with its only limitation being short things which are very close, which would probably make it hard to park in many circumstances. 

This van has been great for roadtrips, also -- tons of space, carry everything you could possibly want, cruise control, plenty of pep for highway driving in addition to what we normally do around here, California mixed surface streets and freeways in low to very heavy traffic. My only complaints would be that the cup holders in the console can't hold anything tall because the dashboard sticks out over it (and this seems to have been remedied in new Safaris), we had to put big speakers in the back and an amp for them to make the stereo really powerful enough for the space, and when you run the air conditioning, well, it's just a huge compressor to cool the interior space of the Safari, so it does impact performance some, and really burns gas. And with a tank nearly 30 gallons in size, filling it up is already staggering.

I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone who does not know how to handle a large vehicle, or who isn't willing to learn. The roads are, in my opinion, already overfull with people who've bought SUVs and don't know how to drive them, treating them as if they were Honda Civics. Driving a big vehicle is not the same as driving a compact or midsize sedan, or even a huge luxury sedan, for that matter. If you're comfortable with small vehicles, I hope you'll think twice before you get a midsize van like the Safari, or an SUV. Minivans probably are a better bet for a lot of people. 
But if you're considering a sport utility vehicle or truck with passenger capacity, the Safari may very well be an excellent choice for you, and one you might not have considered.
