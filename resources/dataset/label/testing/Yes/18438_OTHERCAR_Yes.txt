            I purchased two Mazda's on Sadie Hawkins day 1992.  The first is an MX-6, the subject of this review, the second is the 4x4 SE pickup.    The MX-6 now has 112,500 miles on it and it's time to part with her.  I should be so lucky when I replace it...  This two door coupe performed reliably and sportily over the past 8 years.  Until just this month I, literally, have not had one single repair made to the car..  This is not to say, however that we haven't maintained the car precisely as recommended by Mazda.  The maintenance schedule is rigorous and can be expensive.  The 60,000 mile service is extensive and costs over $800.00 at the dealership.  This particular maintenance is thorough and likely heads off problems before they begin e.g., timing belt replacement, fan belts, tranny service, wheel bearings, steering, heating/cooling system etc etc.  In between these 60,000 mile service monsters, routine maintenance includes periodic tune ups, inspections and of course the 3000 mile oil changes.  That said, I must tell you that I never expected to have basic mechanical devices on a vehicle perform without fail for 8 years and these miles.  This includes the 5 speed transmission, clutch, alternator, air conditioning, cruise control, water and fuel pumps, lights and every other mechanical component or device installed on the car.  So, for reliability, it is a five star.  Now for the downside.  The passenger door never has closed properly on this vehicle and when left ajar over night, as we have done several times, the battery is drained by morning.  A small light under the dash comes on and stays on when the door is open and ajar.  There is a persistent and annoying noise at the firewall.  Some unidentified component under the hood rubs and vibrates against the firewall. We attempted to have this repaired during warranty, but the dealer was not successful in curing the problem.  The two door design is a royal pain in the tush if you need to have passengers in the rear seat. An adult has to be a contortionist to get in and out and the leg room is good only if you are 5'6&quot; or less.  Lastly, we have experience over heating problems in the tape player. We listen to books on tape during cross country trips and the player's wheels slow down after a couple of hours use.  While the problems noted are really minor, they can be annoying.  Why are we parting with it now?  We just discovered an air flow metering system problem that is causing a bit of rough (buck and chuck) action in the motor when cold.  The repair is $600.00 plus labor.  This combined with another super service call coming up in a few months,  just finally turned the cost/benefit ratio against keeping the vehicle any longer, so it is time to kiss her good bye. Overall, the reliability and sporty handling of the vehicle has warranted the investment! <br><br>
