            The new 4runner is one nice looking SUV.  Along with looks the vehicle promises an extremely quiet and comfortable ride, great handling, and plenty of cargo and passenger room.  You can sit back relax, and almost let this car drive itself.  It is comparable to the Dodge Durango in class and size. Although it runs a bit more expensive, about $5,000, than the Durango, it does demonstrate better gas mileage and overall is a slightly more dependable vehicle although it doesn't have the same muscle that the Durango possesses.  This SUV is great in all types of weather and overall is an excellent purchase.  <br><br>
