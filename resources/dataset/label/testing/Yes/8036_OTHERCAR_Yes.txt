            I just chalked up 80,000 miles in my 1992 Saturn SL2 a few weeks ago.  When I first bought it, I never thought that would happen...I had a habit of getting a new car every two years, and fully expected to do the same thing with this.

Well, it's been almost nine years and I'm still quite happy driving it.  I'm not sure exactly why I opted to keep it, but I suppose that the combination of comfort and no payments convinced me to stay away from the new car lots.

There have been problems, to be sure, but nothing that forced my hand.

For a single person or two people with one kid, this car has plenty of space.  I've had an adult in the back seat, but I'm tall enough that I need to put the driver's seat all the way back and there's no way an adult will fit back there.

However, I have dragged my daughter Kiersten and up to three of her nine year old friends in the car.  Since there's no airbag on the passenger's side, Kiersten can (and does) ride in the front seat.

The trunk has room for two sets of golf clubs, along with Kiersten's "mini set".  I generally throw suitcases in the back seat (since there's just the two of us) for road trips, but there is plenty of trunk room for two 21" bags and an assortment of smaller bags.

Kiersten and I have taken numerous lengthy trips (including a 1200 mile excursion to Chicago last November) in the car without any discomfort.  After about five hours on the road, you really want to get up and stretch, but I imagine that would be the case with any vehicle.

So, on with the breakdown:

<i>The Good</i>

1) Reliable -- with the exception of the electrical problems, nothing has gone wrong with the car.

2) Economical -- start with the low price ($12,000 for a fully decked out model) and add good fuel economy (about 20 mpg city, 27 highway) and you have a cheap car to run

3) Handling -- with good tires (see separate review) this front wheel drive car handles well in snow, so long as it isn't too deep.  I've gotten hung up once or twice in very heavy snow (although always managed to get it out myself without towing).

4) Roominess -- I'm a fairly big guy, and my head doesn't hit the roof, even with the sunroof cover closed.

5) Dent resistant panels -- the sides of the car are some sort of plastic, so you can kick it (or have some dope wing his door into your car) and it won't dent.  It will scratch, though.  That's one reason I rarely wash it :-)  I'm sure it also reduces rust (of which I have none.)


<i>The Bad</i>

1) Electrical system -- Major problems (see below)

2) Ride -- this thing is <b>low</b> to the ground.  That takes some getting used to.  It's a fairly stable ride, but being that low, you definitely feel the big bumps.

3) Cup holders -- there aren't any.  I bought a center console that had one, but the holder broke about a year after getting the car.

4) Limited dealerships and expensive parts -- there is no Saturn dealer within 70 miles of my home, so I go to the local GM dealer.  He's helpful, but only has one Saturn trained technician, so repairs take a bit longer.  Also, when Kiersten's mother had the car, she broke off <b>both</b> rear view outside mirrors which were rather expensive to replace.


<i>My SL2 Electrical Saga</i>

I haven't heard of anyone else with the same problems, but I've had recurring electrical problems with this car.  I got smart after a bit, so read ahead for a cost effective solution to endemic problems.

The problems started in about 1994 with a driver's side window that wouldn't work.  Since they are power windows, the shop took apart the door and replaced the wiring, which solved the problem.  This was done under warranty.

About a year later (shortly after the warranty expired, of course :-) the car died.  One quick battery replacement later and I was back in business.  For about a week, when it died again.  I took it to a "friend of a friend" who put in a rebuilt alternator and gave me the old, burned out, one.

About six months later, same problem.  Had the "friend of a friend" rebuild the old alternator and put it in.  That was good for about a year.  The next time it died, I took the car in to Sears, where they pronounced the alternator fit, but the battery toast.  Okay, replace the battery.

Six months later, car is not working again.  I took it in to the GM dealer, who took a look, pronounced the battery <b>and</b> the alternator bad, and replaced both.

Right here is where I saved my bacon.  GM Dealers have a "Mr Goodwrench" warranty, which means that if they fix something for you, they'll repair it again if it goes bad.  Had I done that at the beginning, I'd have saved about five hundred dollars, but read on!

So, to recap, it's about 1997 and I've got a new battery and new alternator.  Fast forward to 1998, which finds the car dead again.  Drag it into the GM dealer, where they happily (?) replace the alternator for free.

1999 finds me, again at the GM dealer, complaining of a dead alternator.  Although I've asked them on each of the preceding visits to look at <i>why </i>the alternator keeps dying, this is the first time out that they track it down.  Seems that something is shorting out (gee, I could have told them that :-) and they fixed it.  I suppose that they looked at my track record and figured that, at one alternator a year, they weren't making any money.

So, here it is, 2001 and the car is running fine.  There are a couple of minor inconveniences (the passenger's side window makes an odd noise if you hold the "up" switch when the window's closed) but otherwise fine.

Although I have the means to get another car, even something far larger and more luxurious, I intend to run this thing into the ground.  For my daughter and I, it's plenty big enough and I don't see the point in investing a lot of money in something else.
