            I've been planning to buy a digital camera for some time.  I was going to get the C-3030, but I later decided that a C-3000 was a much better buy.  For one thing, the larger onboard memory buffer of the C-3030 didn't mean anything to me.  I didn't need Photoshop LE, and I was going to buy a 64 MB card for it anyway. The $200 you save, in my opinion, makes this a much better buy than the C-3030.

Some of my friends are hardcore photographers, and they've been showing me how to use some of the neat tricks of this camera.  Speaking as a novice, this camera will let you explore photography as an art form quite easily. I'm still learning what I can do with it, but I've already produced some excellent pictures (I'm thinking of submitting one or two to a some photography magazines, in fact!).

In the panoramic mode, if you take pictures in a complete 360, the Camedia software lets you create Quicktime VR movies out of them. This lets you truly express the feeling of being at a place.  I've spent many hours with this feature!  One recommendation I have is to buy a CD burner. The digital pictures and &quot;movies&quot; take quite a chunk out of your hard disk space, so it's a good idea to just burn them to CDs so you can take the pressure off your harddrive.  

And now, my complaints:

The panaramic feature is really great but only works with Olympus memory (big surprise, huh?). It takes great ambient light photos and the flash is easy to control, allowing you to moderate the amount of flash. The draw back here is it cannot focus much closer than ten inches or so. Also, the lens cap has a tendency to pop off pretty easily, so it's a good idea to get one of those lens cap tethers. 

Overall, this camera is super easy and takes an outstanding picture in the default mode, but I'd still recommend reading the manual pretty thoroughly.  If the price of the 3030 had been as low as it is now I might have sprung for the difference, but now I don't regret that decision at all. Take my advice and don't waste your time and money on low resolution cameras.  The C-3000 is THE way to go.<br><br>
