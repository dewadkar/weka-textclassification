            3 years ago, I purchased a 95 Pontiac Grand Am. I was tired of driving my husband's Cadillac (or as I call it &quot;The Big Boat.&quot;) Being an extremely petite person, I wanted something more practical for everyday use. By choosing the Grand Am, I made one of the best decisions of my life! I hardly ever hear any revving or clicks and clanks. Although it is somewhat &quot;compact&quot; it still feels roomy, so you will not feel the least bit claustrophobic in this car. It rides very smoothly and quietly. Normally, you don't find that in smaller cars. This car is the exception! I have already put 120,000 miles on this car, and still wouldn't trade it for anything. Aside from your typical minor problems (that you have with ALL cars), this has been a very solid investment. The one big drawback is definately the gas. I would consider this a GAS GUSSLER. However, it is well worth it to me. I figure the extra money I am putting into the car for gas, is still far less expensive than costly repairs. A more minor drawback is that the tires are not very well-equipped for winter driving in the mid-west. I quickly found that out, and had &quot;winter&quot; tires put on my car immediately. Costing less than $175.00 for all four, it made a big difference. Overall, I am very happy with my Grand Am. When it finally breathes it's last breath (which I presume will not be for awhile), I intend to purchase another one right away, without even comparing other makes and models. The Pontiac Grand Am is not ideal for say, 7-feet-tall basketball players, or extremely large people. However, it is IDEAL for anyone else who is looking for a RELIABLE, comfortable ride.  I give this car 2 thumbs up! If they found a way to reduce the gas-gussling problem, this car would be every owner's dream come true!<br><br>
