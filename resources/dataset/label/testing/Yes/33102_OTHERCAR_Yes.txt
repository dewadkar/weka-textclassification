            I've been leasing a 1998 Jimmy for 2 years and I really enjoy the vehicle.  There's plenty of room especially cargo area.  The comfort features are convenient to use and not distracting to use while driving, such as the stereo, air, power seat adjustments and such.  The only bad thing I see is the location of the ashtray.  Being a smoker, I frequently bump the gear handle when trying to use the ashtray.  (Minor problem since I should quit anyway.)  I have to say the vehicle handles wonderfully on sharp turns, and quick stops.  As far as driving, the Jimmy does tend to have some vibration when driving and I am a long distance driver most of the time and tends to sway a little when driving in windy conditions.  As far as the size of the Jimmy it's perfect for me since I very rarely have passengers, but I do haul a lot of stuff.  That's why I recommend the tinted windows, no one can see what you're hauling.  The back seat area is very roomy for passengers and also folds down for extra cargo area.  Love that.  So far no engine problems, starting etc.  This is my third sports utility vehicle and so far the best.  Pretty good on gas.<br><br>
