            I bought a 2002 Dodge Ram Quad Cab (short bed) SLT in mid-February 2002.  Six weeks later, I have nothing but praise for it.

I got the all-new 4.7 liter V8.  It puts out 235 horses (except in California) and it is awesome.  It has comparable specs to the old 5.2, but it gets 3 miles per gallon more.  You will not be disappointed in this engine.  Also, don't spend you money on the 5.9 liter engine, it's not worth it.  It only puts out 10 more horses, and it takes longer to rev up.  Instead, take the $800 that the 5.9 costs and put it into modifications to the 4.7, and you will have a killer engine.

Inside, the truck is incredibly roomy.  Storage compartments abound and you can find a place to store anything, even a hook for grocery bags.

Outside, the truck is great, with good paint.  I got mine in Atlantic Blue Pearl Coat, and it is the prettiest color I have ever seen.  I have gotten so many compliments on the color, it's not even funny.

Also, the Infinity sound system is well worth it.  It comes with 3 tweeters in the dash, two subwoofers in the front doors, and 2-way speakers in the rear doors.
