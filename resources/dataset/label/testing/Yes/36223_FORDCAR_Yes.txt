            When my car was in the shop for repairs, I rented two cars from Avis rent a car, one was the 2000 ford focus, and the other a 2000 pontiac grand am.  I found the ford focus to be a smooth ride, cheep on gas, and economical.  I found that the ride, suspension, supports where excellent.  I did not feel the bumps in the road.  Also, the car had a built in child restraint, which I found to be an excellent feature, meaning I did not have to transfer the car seat from my car to this one.  I found the mileage and the gas expense to be extremly well. I drove from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Selkirk, Manitoba, and back, over 200 km. on just over half a tank of gas, and I was just amazed.  The car handle excellently in city, as well as high way driving.  I would recommend the car if you are looking to purchase a new vehicle.<br><br>
