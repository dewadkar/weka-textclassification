            Some of you may question why I am doing a review of an older truck, but someone out there may be looking into a used vehicle and I hope to give them some advice about it so as that they won't make any rash decisions. I own a 1994 Chevrolet S-10 short bed, it has a regular cab and a 2.2 liter four cylinder engine. I like my truck a lot. So far it has been very reliable and I have not had any problems outside of any wear and tear. The '94 S-10 is completely redesigned from the '93 and older S-10's and I love the newer look. The truck handles pretty well and rides really smooth. Depending on the truck you look at you can get many different options, cd player, cassette deck, radio, tilt wheel, cruise, air, daytime running lights, and much more. One of the things I do not like about my particular truck is that it has very slow acceleration. This is due to the smaller engine I have, if you had the 4.3 liter V6 I doubt you would have this problem. Another thing is that I don't particularly like the gas mileage either. I do all my driving in the city and I get about 16.4 mpg, which isn't too bad, but it could be better. Also, without having the extended cab you feel a bit cramped and can not carry many people, about three tops, legally that is. Overall I like this truck and think that it is very good for some people. But others may prefer a larger or more powerful vehicle.<br><br>
