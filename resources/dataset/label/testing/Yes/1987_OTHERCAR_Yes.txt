            I bought the nissan maxima, because I wanted a fast, reliable,sports sedan,with good fit and finish. With my 2000 Maxima, I got just that!I have found nothing to hate about the vehicle as of yet...5k miles only.The neat part about this car is its ability to accelerate, and handle like a nimble sports car, while giving you every amenity of a family sedan.In my opinion, the people who are looking at the Accords, and Camry's....along with the people who are buying American &quot;junk&quot;, should really consider the maxima....in my opinion, it is the car to beat in its class...20 thousand to 30 thousand range, and probably is the car to beat up to 35 thousand range, although I have not driven a Acura TL. They always compare the Maxima to this car, and they seem about even.The Acura sells in the 35 thousand range.<br><br>
