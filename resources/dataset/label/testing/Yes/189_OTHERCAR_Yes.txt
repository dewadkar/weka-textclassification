            This vehicle is a great SUV.  I purchused one this year.  When I was driving home wioth it I could'nt believe how smooth the ride was.  I drive my vehicles through a lot and the Rodeo can hold up to anything, snow and mud.  I can not think of one thing I hate about this vehicle, everything is so nice.  This a perfect vehicle for anyone.  If you like a SUV that drives like a cadilac this is the vehicle to buy.  I had a jeep cherkee before the Rodeo and you can not compare them.  The Rodeo is much nicer and handles even better.<br><br>
