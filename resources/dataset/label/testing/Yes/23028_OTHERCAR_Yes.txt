            I have had my PDC 640 for about 8 months. I love it!!! If you are looking for an easy to use, good priced, fun, digital camera, you cannot go wrong with this one. I took a picture of a calendar I had on my wall just to see how it would do....EXCELLENT! You could not tell it was a calendar photo. I have taken some good shots of the Strip in Vegas while driving down the road...some of the Mojave desert in the rain....some of my dog...they all turned out wonderful!It also does great people shots, close ups and indoor shots! It's great for the online auction seller for taking the pictures of the items you have for sale...we all know that a picture says a thousand words! New parents, would find this camera a great asset to show off that new bundle of joy to family, friends and the world via email or online photo album, AND.....its affordable!!! Great gift for the teenager in your life too! 
The PDC 640 gives you 3 flash settings, 4 resolutions settings, 3 type settings. The only thing I can say remotely negative about this camera is that it comes with only a 2meg memory card. I have since purchased an 8meg card (smart media 29.95)and am very happy with the amount of pics it will store. 


All in all this camera has made me very happy!<br><br>
