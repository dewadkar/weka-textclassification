            I have a 1993 4-Door Ford Escort LX. It was my very first car and I bought it brand-spanking new! Here almost 7 years later and 135k miles gone by, I must say this car has been reliable, durable, and it is holding up the rigors of three kids!

The roominess in the trunk I thought was fantastic for the size of the car. I was really surprised that it was so open.

Similiar to twicesweet's opinion, I had trouble with my air conditioner when it was new. The same problem: the O-ring was bad. One other problem: there was a hole in the compressor. Luckily, it was fixed and hasn't caused any trouble since then. Other than regular maintenance and minor repairs along the way, nothing has went wrong with this car. No leaks gone unfound, no reoccuring nightmares, and nothing going up at regularly scheduled intervals! No pumps going up, no engines seizing up, no transmission problems, no electrical problems. No problems with the fuel system and no problems with the radiator. This car has been awesome!

The body has also held up to the elements and time. With no accidents in this car's history, the only visible sign of age is two small spots of rust just beginning on the front of the hood.

With continued care and maintenance, this car will last indefinitley. (Maybe even long enough for me to pass it on to my oldest son, for when he starts driving, in 11 more years!!)
