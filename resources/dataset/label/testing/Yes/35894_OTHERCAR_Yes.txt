            I bought my Tiburon new from the dealer in 1997.  It's an amazing little car.  So stylish and reliable.  With normal maintenance I have had relatively no problems with my Tiburon.  The front seats are comfy and can accommodate someone up to 6'3" no problem, but the back seat is another story. I would only put one person back there and have their legs go across to the other seat.  And like others have said, this car is not for those with children or thinking of having children.

The speakers in my Tiburon are great and although I've had the car almost 5 years, they still sound great.  I had a 12-disc cd changer put in and that makes a long drive smooth.

The handling of the car is awesome and it has a lot of get up and go for a "4 banger".  I have the 5-speed manual and love the power I feel when I shift down for more power.  I'm not sure why one of the other raters said they had problems with manuevering in rain and ice, I have had no problem in that area.  Additionally, I bought my Tiburon in 1997 also and mine came with the 5/10 year warranties.  So I don't know what that rater was talking about not getting a warranty.

The controls for the car are great but I hate the cup holders in this model year.  Hopefully they have changed this with newer models.  The road noise is a little more than I'd like, but I can deal with that.

I also have the "check engine light" come on ocassionally, but this is due to not screwing down the gas cap tight enough.  When I screw it down real tight I don't have the light come on.

All in all I love this car.  It's fun and reliable and catches the eye of everyone.
