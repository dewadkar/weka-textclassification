            Since purchasing a used Ford Ranger extended cab (95' model year) our lives have been seriously simplified. We have room for 4 passengers and the bed of course is great for hauling.  The truck is reliable, dependable, zippy and never causes us any problems. It's not capable of hauling a large boat--but since we don't own one, that's OK. Great for families who do lots of home remodeling and need to haul stuff from a lumber yard or for gardening mulch, etc...

We have also taken the truck for long road trips (8 hours or so).  And keep in mind that is with 2 little kids and a 55 pound dog.  The trip was great and the truck was plenty comfortable.   

Highly recommended--and we are picky, picky, picky!<br><br>
