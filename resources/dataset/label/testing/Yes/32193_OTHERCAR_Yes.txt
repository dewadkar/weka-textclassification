            I now own a 1999 Cavalier. I bought a Cavalier back in High School. It was a 1988 Model. When I bought it, it was used. i drove this car until it hit 115,000 miles. Never had a problem. I only had do perform regular maintenance. I have owned a few more expensive cars since then . (spendthrift X-husband)Each one of these higher priced cars I had MAJOR problems with.Nothing like my Cavalier was.  After my divorce I needed a more economical, reliable car. I immediately checked out the Cavalier. I fell in love with it. Sure-it's an &quot;economy&quot; car, but some of us need that. I drive 50 plus miles a day back and forth from work. I have put 30,000 miles on my car in one year. Not even a click in the valves. (and unfortunately I buy cheap gas!)
