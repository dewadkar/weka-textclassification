            A few years back I remember watching a daytime talk show and they had this mini-fake- soap opera western called Durango. That is just a little history on the name, then Dodge came out with the Durango. When I received the mailing advertising this truck from Dodge, I was hooked. I saw the styling and it screamed to me. The vehicle looked so muscular yet sophisticated. From then, I went on my quest to attain this vehicle.

My parents were looking to buy a new vehicle that would replace the 1997 Dodge Caravan that my mother had been driving, of course I suggested the Durango. We took a look at the competitors, the Chevy Blazer and Ford Explorer. My uncle has a blazer so we knew from experience that it wasn't the roomiest of vehicles. Sitting on the passenger side in a blazer can be annoying, the glove compartment is oddly curved so it is menacingly close to your knees. The Blazer just didn't have the style that we were looking for. The Explorer was good and had the features that we wanted, but the price was just too much. So it was to the Durango. 

Our Durango is adequately equipped, it isn't a 4wd with all the perks, its simple and has everything we need, cassette, ac, power windows, keyless entry, and room to fit gear and people. Driving the Durango is quite a treat. As you press down on the accelerator you can feel the power of the V8 engine rumbling under you. That power is extremely convenient and assuring. Another nice feature of the Durango is the turning radius, it is so good that you can make a U-turn in a small residential street without using the good old 3 pt. technique. The shocks are truck-like and absorb potholes, the frequent &quot;accidental&quot; goings up on sidewalks near your driveway, and the common unpaved parking lot, very well. 

Test drive the Durango. This vehicle is good for people who enjoy an occasional off-roading trip in suburbia, or for weekend warriors. But make sure you either live in a place where gas is cheap or haggle your dealer down a bit so you can afford the gas. Because it is a gas-guzzler, especially with the V8, but with the new V6 caravan engine it won't be a problem.
