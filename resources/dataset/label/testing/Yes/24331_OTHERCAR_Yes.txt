            We have a older model Buick Regal.It's a 91 I think.  The size is a plus with us because we need to fit 2 car seats in the back. It runs good for the most part. It has almost 100,000 miles on it and still in good condition. We bought it used after my husband was in a wreck and needed a family car in a pinch. The good things about it are it has a pretty good size trunk. I can fit my stroller and a weeks work of groceries in it without any problems. A few bads things about it are that the seat belt latches were backwards. We had to twist them to make them go on straight. The driver side seat belt wouldn't retract and my hubby still hasn't gotten it fixed :(   Still a good car for the money.<br><br>
