            I recently purchased my Mavica FD-83 and I really love it.  It's a very easy to use camera with lots of capabilities.  The biggest advantage to this particular camera is that it allows the user to save the pictures onto a floppy disk, the most inexpensive and portable storage media.  I've looked at a few of the others and although they have just as good capabilities and cost a bit less, you end up breaking even by having to buy the storage cards and the card drives.  I think it's worth it to buy this camera if you plan to take pictures on family trips and just bring a big case of floppy disks, this allows the ability to access the pictures using any computer around.

This camera also have some great features.  I especially like the automatic spot metering, the sepia tone, and the black and white.  It also have the ability to store small movies.  This camera is very fun to use, as well as easy to use.  It's worth every penny. 

This camera is also one of a kind.  Because of the floppy disk drive, it's compact, and well-suited for travel.  Sony is the only one, that I have seen, to offer a floppy disk drive storage.  Panasonic has one with a superdisk storage which sounds great, but again you need a computer with LS-120 drive on it to read the data and Im sure its going to cost an arm and a leg or maybe even two. :-) <br><br>
