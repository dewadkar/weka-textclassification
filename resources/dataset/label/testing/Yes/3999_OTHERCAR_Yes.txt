            My parents leased a 97 SL2 for three years and were planning on buying it. However, just as the lease was ending, the new L-Series was introduced. So we all decided to check it out. They found that the new, larger sedan's design eliminated their one major complaint about the SL- that it was a little difficult to get in and out of for them (they're hitting post-middle-age, and can't quite move like kids anymore.) 

That, along with the slightly larger size, was all it took for them to decide to buy a new 2000 LS2 instead of the SL.
We were amongst the first to buy one, in fact. 

We were all thrilled with it (I snagged it for myself whenever they weren't driving it.) It offers a lot of the luxury options found in more expensive cars, but without the expensive price. In the LS2, the standard stereo came with CD and tape players! Their model also has the power package with power windows, locks, and mirrors. Additionally, they added the option of a power driver's seat.

We (okay, they) chose the V-6 engine. Does she ever have some get-up-and-go to her, which is really useful when getting on the freeway! 

My only complaint is that the dividing panel between the front and back doors/windows creates a tricky blind spot for me. 

Life was wonderful for the next 6 weeks. Then, one day when mom and I were out running errands, disaster struck. Mom was driving and had just pulled out from a stop sign to make a left turn when a guy came flying like a bat out of you-know-where around a curve, plowing straight into the driver's side back door. 

We estimate that he was going at least 40-45 mph (in a 35 mph zone, although that's neither here nor there.) Even slamming on his breaks hard enough that there was smoke coming from his tires, his much smaller car hit us with enough force to push us a good 15 feet.

Mom and I walked away without a single scratch. The dent-resistant polymer panel of the back door was broken. But at that point, we didn't really care. The simple fact was, we walked away completely unharmed from an accident that could have put us in the hospital. I still shudder to think what could have been if we'd been in a different car-one that didn't have a steel frame.

They had the car repaired, of course. Even that wasn't as expensive as they'd expected. But what happened just a few months later floors us even more...

The dealership where my parents had purchased the car called them up one day and asked if they could have the car. In return, they would give my parents a BRAND NEW ONE!! Since it was one of the first of the new L-Series line to be in an accident and repaired, the company wanted to do an 'autopsy' and get more information about how it held up and what repairs were needed. 

Now, obviously, this won't happen to everyone. But it just goes to show what kind of company Saturn really is. You know those commercials where they announce over the intercom when someone gets their car? They really do it! They even sent us a mug with the picture they took of us when we bought the car. 

Each month or so, they hold 'New Owner's Clinics.' At the clinic, they show you how to perform basic maintenance functions (change a tire, check fluids, etc.) and answer any questions you may have thought of since you've had your car. You're taken on a tour of the service area (which is always spotless, no matter what time of day you see it and what work they are doing.) And, they have free food, usually pizza or subs and pop. The also draw names for door prizes like a car care kit and other Saturn goodies. Everyone who attends gets a free tube of touch up paint. (Check with your local dealership for all the details, as they may differ by location.)

After every service appointment, we've been contacted to complete a quick survey of our experience. In a world of 'close the deal and move on to the next customers,' Saturn has a slower pace that focuses on the needs of the customer, not the desire of the sales consultant to sell a car. They truly care about the individual, and their reputation. They work towards being the car and the dealerships that you go back to, and that you recommend to your friends and family. 

Now, 3 years later, the LS2 has only needed basic maintenance. The gas mileage is great (26-30 mpg), especially for the V-6 engine. The insurance seems to be a lot lower on it than on other cars of its class.

But the bottom line is that this car came through when we needed it most, and with flying colors. So much so, that I now also own a Saturn, a 2002 SL2.
