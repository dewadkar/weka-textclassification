            Recently I leased a new Jetta, as my Ford Focus lease is up in a couple more weeks.  I was considering the Honda Civic EX and the Mazda Protege' 5, as these were both in the same price range as my Focus.  I decided to look at the VW Golf, too, so the VW dealer was my first stop, I was just gonna drive, get a payment estimate, and keep looking at the other models.  What happened next was completely unplanned.

The salesman I worked with explained that because of the uber resale value on the Jettas they lease out better than most cars on the road, having about a 58% residual value after 3 years, in comparison a Ford Taurus has about a 42%, so you end up paying for that difference in the lease.  My payment on the Jetta is the same as it was on the Focus, even though the Jetta sticker priced for about $7K more.  That pretty much sold me there.  Then I drove one...

I drove the 1.8L Turbo, since the base engine has less power than my focus had, so I was not going to go with the base engine.  Payment-wise, the 2003 turbos with less options were about the same as the 2002s they had with more goodies, so that is the way I decided to go.  Here is what My Jetta has:

Jetta GLS
1.8L turbo
Sport/luxury PKG (moonroof, sport suspension, and 17" wheels)
Monsoon Audio system

This car is smartly designed, especially for a variety of different-sized people.  I'm 6'3 and have plenty of headroom and legroom.  The controls are smartly placed, and easy to operate.  The height-adjustable seats and tilt/telescope wheel is nice too.  There's too many great features to list, do yourself a favor and drive one, you will be astonished at the quality and features for the price.

My only complaint is there is no overhead slot for sunglasses, garagedoor opener, etc. and no good spot to put a cell phone, it keeps getting thrown around while driving.
