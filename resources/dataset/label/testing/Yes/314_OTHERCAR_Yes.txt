            Three months ago, I purchased a 2000 Nissan Xterra XE-V6 with the Sports Package, Utility Package and Power Package. I've put 4,000 miles on it since then, including a drive from California to Washington DC. I've managed to form an opinion or two.

<b>STYLES</b>
 One thing doesn't make a lot of sense. Try to find an XE that doesn't come with all of the options. So why make two models at all? The only real differences between a loaded XE-V6 and an SE are the leather padded steering wheel, the moon-roof, different seats and a cassette deck in addition to the CD player. These extras will cost you an extra $1000 over the price of a loaded XE-V6.

 I did see one the other day on the freeway that did not have a roof rack. It was the first that I've seen. Until it passed me, I had no idea that it was an Xterra. The roof rack makes the distinction quite clear.

<b>PRICE</b>
 A loaded Xterra costs about $25,000 depending on dealers, region, etc. For the money, I think it's difficult to do better. Sure, you can spend less and go with the mini-utes from Honda, Suzuki, etc., but if you're looking for a rugged off-road vehicle, there are really just two options. Xterra and Cherokee. To get more creature comforts, you're going to spend at least $5,000 more. Ouch.

<b>COMFORT</b>
 First of all, it's a TRUCK. It drives like a truck. It sits like a truck. I took five days to drive across country and spent six to seven hours in it each day. Without a doubt, I was sore when I climbed into the seat on the second day. It definitely lacks in lumbar support, but after the end of the second day, I got used to it and have since grown quite comfortable sitting in it. I guess it's a matter of whatever you're used to.

 The truck is also a bit noisy at highway speeds. That stylish roof rack generates a bit of a roar when you're driving fast. Of course, the 100 watt stereo does wonders for drowning out the sound of the roof rack.

 The controls are easy to get to with the exception of the cruise control on/off button. It's really in a bad place. It's to the left of the steering wheel on the bottom of the dash. There's a green LED on the button that turns on to show that the cruise control has power. Unfortunately, this green LED is far too weak to see during daylight hours, so the only way to tell when the cruise control has power is to simply try it out using the controls mounted on the steering wheel. Of course and in typical Japanese form, the hazard light on/off switch is located prominently at the center of the dash, above the radio. It's within really easy reach, but how often do you use that?

 The stereo display is LCD. It's easily seen at night but can be difficult to read during the day.

<b>EXTERIOR</b>
 I bought the Solar Yellow model. It definitely turns heads and gets attention. On numerous occasions, I've found people gathered around it while it was parked in the lot. I love that.

 One thing to consider is removable gear basket that's mounted on the front of the roof rack. The basket is held down by screws that are hand tightened. I've taken mine off because I tend to leave it in parking lots during the day. I'd rather not worry about having it stolen. I've also heard stories that the full sized spare tire is easily stolen.

<b>ENGINE</b>
 The 3.3 V6 seems a bit underpowered, no doubt about it. A 4.0 liter engine would have been nice or possibly the same supercharged engine that is in the 2001 Frontier. However, the longer I've owned it, the better feel I've developed for the torque curve. It will move fast enough to keep you out of trouble when needed. I'm sure the 4-cylinder model is horrible no matter how long you've owned it.

 Mileage during my trip across country was approximately 19 MPG as advertised. The mileage does suffer when climbing or using the air conditioner, but does well enough across the great, flat and boring expanse of northern Texas.

<b>PROBLEMS</b>
 There's one recall, that I know of. It came out in November. I'll repeat the notice here:

<i>Vehicles could have a shift cable lock plate that is too brittle and can break. The gear shift lever and the "PRNDL" indicator may move, but the transmission will not shift out of the Park position. Over a period of time, the transmission could shift out of the Park position, but the gear indicated on the display may differ from the gear engaged in the transmission. If the driver selects 'drive' and the transmission is actually in 'reverse', a vehicle crash could occur.</i>

 I learned of another problem at the Xterra Owners Club, http://xterraownersclub.com. Evidently, the undercoating next to each of the rear wheels is damaged by the car carrier during transport from the manufacturer to the dealer. All of the Xterras share this problem. I've spoke to the local Nissan dealer (Passport Nissan of Alexandria, VA.) and they will do nothing until a recall is issued by Nissan. Unfortunately, I am living in an area where salt is used on the roads to combat ice and snow. Of course, I could probably fix it myself, but then I am no longer protected by the warranty. I'm a bit unhappy that Nissan hasn't been more proactive about this issue. This is a relatively cheap fix but they haven't worked past the "denial" stage of a warranty issue. In the mean time, I'll have to wait and see and hope that Nissan will do the right thing.


<b>COMMUNITY</b>
 The Xterra community is wonderful. There are many clubs formed all over the country. They plan trips, share information and help each other. It's incredible. I've not seen anything like this since "back in the day" when I used to own a '66 Mustang.
 If you're thinking about purchasing one or you already own an Xterra, be sure to visit the Xterra Owners Club (http://www.xterraownersclub.com). You'll find a many helpful people there.

<b>PURCHASING</b>
 I researched this vehicle quite heavily on the net before I purchased it. Sites such as Edmunds.com (http://www.edmunds.com) and CarPoint (http://www.carpoint.com) are quite helpful and good places to start digging. If you don't research the vehicle you're buying, you'll probably spend $2000 to $3000 more than an informed customer. I checked with AutoBytel (http://www.autobytel.com) and found that the rates they give are as good as any fleet rates you may get from AAA (http://www.aaa-calif.com/) or CostCo (http://www.costco.com). My advice is to speak first with a similar organization before you talk to the dealer and then, work with the fleet representative and not one of the sharks that patrol the lot.

 I financed it through E-Loan (http://www.eloan.com). Well worth doing. I had the truck financed before I showed up to the dealer. This negates the age old tactic of "How much can you spend a month?" that you get from almost every car salesman in the country. I later found out that the rate I got from E-Loan was even better than those offered by Nissan.
