            I originally bought my Volkswagen Jetta two years ago because it was very popular. I really liked the boxy look of the Jetta. Most of all I love the fact that I can drive for over a week on one tank of gas. It runs well and I have not had to take it to the shop for more than new breaks and oil changes. 

The trunk on this car is huge which is great for lugging groceries and just about anything else. The back seats can fold down giving you even more trunk space. I also like the convenience of having four doors and rear safety locks which is great when you have children. 

There are only two features on my Jetta that I do not like. The first feature is the front cupholders. You cannot fit a big cup in them which is unfortunate for someone like me who loves Biggie drinks. The second is there is no glove box. This is because of the dual airbags in the front. Other then those minor inconveniences, I think this is a great car for anyone.<br><br>
