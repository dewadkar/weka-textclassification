               I bought my 1992 Mercury Cougar SPECIAL EDITION from my aunt. She decided to buy a new car and I was going to be getting my license. She decided to sell it to me for a reasonable price and it evolved into the first love of my life. It's a little old-fashioned when you look at it's body but on the inside, it has plenty of room for book bags, luggage and passengers.
   I began driving in the summer, so one pro is that it had decent air conditioning. Little did I know that my Cougar would only cause me more and more trouble as the weather became more cold. 
   It all began the first time I tried using my heater. It didn't work, but later on I found out that it was just a cable that was lose behind the glove compartment. After wards I had excellent heating in my car but it gradually became less and less dependent. My father, who knows a lot about cars, tried changing the thermostat but that did not work. The weird thing though is that my car occasionally gets warm. It appears that my car is overheating, but then once my heat kicks in, the gauge falls back down to the normal heat zone. This gained my curiosity because my car is showing no signs of overheating. 
   In the past week, we've had subzero temperatures and it's so inconvenient to have NO heat in your car. This spring I plan to hopefully have my car fixed, and sold for hopefully more than I bought it for. It's become more of a hassle than luxury.
  Other than the heating/overheating issues, this is quite the swell car. Everything is automatic and it's comfortable to drive. The trunk is HUGE, even though I hardly use it, and it has a big gas tank! Hopefully this will be useful information.
