            It's really sad that Mitsubishi decided to discontinue the 3000gt in the US.  Among the affordable sports cars, this is one of the greatest around.  I own the '93 base model, but I have no complaints.  After driving the '99 Mustang (v6), and a '98 Firebird, I realize what a great car the 3000gt really is.  It CAN and WILL take any V6 domestic off the line!!!  It's fast, nuff said.

The 3000gt handles very well, and shifting is a breeze.  If you can get a good deal on a used 3000gt, GO FOR IT!  Take it for a drive, and then test drive a new v6 domestic, and see what they lack.

I am never giving up my 3000gt, unless I wreck it, or find a VR4(turbo), it's staying with me 'til I die.

BTW, the 3000gt is the fastest production front wheel drive to date.

check out the specs on the VR4, it will impress any enthusiast.<br><br>
