            Greetings,

I've graduated from the MVC-FD91 camera in August 2000. My first grandson was born in July, and the MVC-FD91 took absolutely fantastic gorgeous photographs. I figured &quot;if this camera takes such great photos, can you imagine what the MVC-FD95 will do???&quot; So, I rushed down to Wolf camera and traded my MVC-FD91 in and picked up my MVC-FD95!  Oh boy!

I thought I had made a horrible mistake. The camera took fantastic photos out doors, but whenever I tried to take a photo of the new baby, they turned out grainy. Back to Wolf.  We played in the store with the camera and finally made some adjustments and sent me on my way. NO DIFFERENCE. BACK to Wolf. They were great. They merely switched the camera and gave me this one.

Got home, went to see the baby, and OH WOW!  The photos are gorgeous.  Unfortunately, they aren't that much better than the old MVC-FD91, but I enjoy the things I can do with the MVC-FD95.

The PROS:  

I like the eyepiece viewer, sometimes, in bright light, it's difficult to frame using the LCD screen, the eyepiece is a nice touch. It's also cool that it only comes on when your eye touches it.

The controls are easy enough for a klutz (i.e., ME) to figure out and use. I'm having a GREAT time playing with the different options.

With a tripod and self-timer, it takes fantastic photos at night! Try taking a photo of your house, at 11pm, with an 8 second exposure, but make sure you use the self timer so it doesn't move.

The zoom allows up close and personal shots that are just as clear and sharp as if you WERE up close and personal.

The floppy drive media! Frankly, this is the reason I went with Sony in the first place. I really enjoy the ability to pop in a floppy, take my 10 photos, and then pop it into the computer. No adaptors, no nothing except the pile of floppies!

The controls (yeah, I know I mentioned them above, but this is about the LCD controls - or rather the controls found on the LCD screen) I love the fact that you can control the level of flash; the different formats, even the numbering of the photos; the fact that you can turn the sound on and off (it's nice, in church, to be able to take photos without the constant 'ping')

Bearing in mind that I've only used Sony, this is the closest camera to a 35mm that I've ever seen! You can change the aperture and/or the shutter speed, among other things.  This is fabulous!

Okay, the CONS:

Yes, sadly there ARE some things that could be better with the camera (bearing in mind my previous experience with the MVC-FD91)

Why oh why did they put the battery charger connection on the bottom of the lens in such a way that you almost need to be a contortionist to get the plug in?  The salesman made it a point of importance that 'no longer do you need an external battery charger.' FRANKLY, I'd much rather have an external battery charger. I have 2 batteries, and if I'm out and about, when the second battery runs down, I'm out of business. At least with the MVC-FD91, you could pop the first battery in the charger and keep shooting.

It's BIG! Don't expect to stick it in your shirt pocket!  Invest in a carrying case for the camera, a pile of floppies and a tripod!

I got the memory stick, and I DID heed the warnings about speed. It's about twice as slow as recording to a floppy! That's a drawback when you're taking photos of kids. It takes about 8 seconds to record on the memory stick vs. about 4 seconds to get it on floppy. With the price of floppies, I may just go back to them, except when I am out of pockets and need space.

My BIGGEST complaint, with ALL MVC cameras is the placement of the shoulder strap holder. It's DIRECTLY above the floppy drive door. Who in their right mind would ever design such a thing?  It could have been moved a bit out of the way, to make insertion and removal of the disk easier. It looks like the designer never looked at the finished product.

One last minor dislike. The time between framing a photo and 'locking in' is too long. Often the baby will have moved by the time I'm ready to snap the shutter.

My two biggest drawbacks then, are the battery charger (built in) and the placement of the shoulder harness.

My Wish List:  I'd like to see some lens for this camera so I can play some more.

I'd like to see some way to record photos FASTER.

I'd like Sony to sell a separate battery charger. I'd buy one in a heartbeat!

PS: For all you digital owners, don't forget to use your camera to take a photographic inventory of your home and your possessions. When you get ready, take a photo in a mirror so you'll even have a photo of your MVC-FD95. Store the floppies in a Safe Deposit Box at your bank. In case of fire or theft, you're covered!
