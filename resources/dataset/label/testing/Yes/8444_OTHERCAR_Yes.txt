            I leased a GS 300 in November of 1998 and have nothing but good things to say about my Lexus.  I looked a the BMW 5 series, Audi A 6 and the basic Mercedes when initially shopping for cars in the low 40k range.  The lexus was a far superior choice hands down.  The GS had better handling, style, and speed than any of the above mentioned cars.  The Lexus has seamless automatic shifting and great speed .  The vehicle turns with almost no body roll and sharp turns are effortless.  One must be careful not to scare our passengers when driving this awsome car because it is easy to drive like a maniac when you are behind the wheel.  I even make excuses to drive to the market at night just so I can enjoy the experience. If you want a sports car that is family friendly and impresses the next door neighbors, drive a GS. <br><br>
