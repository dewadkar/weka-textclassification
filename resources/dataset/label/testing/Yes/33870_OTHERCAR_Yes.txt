            I still cannot imagine why people spend $10,000 more for a minivan, when the Villager has it all. Comfort, styling, features, and an affordable pricetag, the Mercury Villager walks all over the Dodge Caravans and the more-expensive Toyotas and Pontiacs. There is great storage area, the handling is unbeatable.

 This minivan is quiet and roomy and is the perfect vehicle for families. I have a 1993 Villager with over 114,000 miles and I have had no problems at all, and the new Villagers are even better. The rear air conditioner works great and we love the lumbar support in the driver's seat...especially for long trips. The Villager is also powerful enough to tow a travel trailer with no hesitation or loss of power. The Villagers get wonderful gas mileage, too, especially nice while the gas prices are so high.

 I cannot find anything wrong with this van, so if you are in the market for a family car or minivan, test drive this one. The 2000's can be found for under $20,000 and their &quot;base&quot; model is not at all lacking anything. This is a great car!!!<br><br>
