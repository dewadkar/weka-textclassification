We bought our Saturn SC2 because I had always wanted one, and since there is just me and my husband, I don't have to worry about if growing children will have enough room.

I really love this car because it is very economical to drive, hugs the road and takes curves so easy, it is easy to get into tight places, goes just about anywhere a four wheel drive can go, and no matter what it just keeps going with so few problems and repairs to be done it saves even more money by not being in a repair shop even after 115,000 miles. 
I really can't find anything about my Saturn that I hate about it, and all I can do is praise the Owners/employees of Saturn for putting the thought and pride into the cars they build.

Anyone wanting to save money on repairs, gas, get into places that larger cars and trucks won't fit into, and enjoys driving a safe, easy to drive car should buy a Saturn.

People with large families should not consider this car, or a very tall person unless the person is willing to forego some comfort in the head room area.
