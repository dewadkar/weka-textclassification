            Intro - I have now had the opportunity to properly break in my 2003 electric red 330i w/ sport package, heated seats, moon roof and xenon's.  I came across this car at BMW of Watertown, CT. and the dealer was very aggressive in trying to move it.  The car was in the showroom and the dealer even through in a very much-needed set of snows and had them mounted on the car when I picked it up.  A great experience!

Research - In selecting this car I test-drove almost everything in the market it competes with.  In the end the dynamics of the BMW were so far superior that the difference in price could not take away the feeling that all other cars would be settling.  In fact, after it was all said and done I had to choose between the 330i and a VW Jetta GLI 6-speed.  I thought for the difference in price the Jetta was a great ride for the price.  

Some observations from test drives.

Lexus IS-300 - Great driving dynamics, but teenager interior that also felt extremely small.  Too many on the road with pimped out modifications.

Audi A4 - Not the sporty feel as the Lexus and Bimmer.  Interior was beautiful but center column came too far into right leg resting are.  Had the feeling that it would be perfect for my wife.

Volvo S60 - Expensive for what you get.  Way too soft!

Infiniti G35 - No stick shift when I was looking.  I was not too impressed with interior.

VW Passat - I like the driving feel of the Jetta better.

VW Jetta 6Cyl/6Man - Front wheel drive (with all the benefits and deterrents).  About $18,000 less but a great value.  

Nothing else was interesting enough to test drive.

The Car - Now to the BMW.  The quote of this car having a feeling "alien" to all other makes is on the money.  Its feel behind the wheel is absolutely amazing.  Power is endless at any point and comfort is outstanding.  There is also something about the sound of the car.  It literally crackles when pushed giving the sweetest exhaust note.  Nothing that intrudes the serinity of the cabin, just a pure sound of assurance letting everyong know the engineering superiority.  

Recommendation - My father owns a 2001 325ci.  We both agree that the difference in the engines is substantial.  The 325 is a great car but it does not have the perfect power band of the 330i.  The balance of the 330 is sublime!  To cut some corners, I would go for the leatherette rather than leather.  The quality of the leatherette is fantastic.  However, I would highly recommend the sport package for the seats.  They are the best in the business and provide a perfect comfort for commuting.  The quality of the radio is only fair.  Xenon's are really cool and heated seats in the region of the country are a must.  

Finally - There are a lot of great sport sedans out there.  But I truly feel that the Jetta can run with most of them.  The BMW is truly in a different galaxy.  It is a car for an enthusiast.  If the driving experience is not a priorty, I am sure you can do better.  But for me driving is one of the joys of life and I put a lot of value in it.  I'd even rank the 325 above all of the competition, but the 330i is without question the PERFECT AUTOMOBILE!
