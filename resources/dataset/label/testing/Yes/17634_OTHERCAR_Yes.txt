              My wife and I bought our SC2 after her car was totaled in an accident.  We didn't spend much time looking around at other cars.  The Saturn dealership was one of the few shops we went to.  When we saw the SC2 in the showroom we fell in love with it.
  We bought the fully loaded SC2, all options for around $20,000.  It has leather seating, sunroof, cruise control, CD player, and just about every option we could want.  It is a comfortable driving experience.
  It is a four-cylinder; this was the only thing I didn't like about the car.  I wanted something with a larger engine.  However, I was impressed by the power and zippiness of this car.  It has more power than most 6-cylnders I have driven.  I have never been wanting for power in this car.  It does not lack in either initial or top speed acceleration.
  It handles well also.  Although it won't stick to the road the way a Corvette or Mustang would.  It corners quite well.  It is computer-equipped for sensing loss of traction in any wheel and responding with the appropriate power.  I have been impressed with this car's abilities.
  Although the SC2 may not look as sporty as some of the other sport cars on the road.  It turns enough heads for me.
  We have not noticed any mechanical problems within our first year of ownership.
  A lot is said about the Saturn Dealerships themselves.  When we went in to the San Juan Capistrano, CA showroom, we were treated with respect.  There was no pressure to buy from the salesman.  He didn't shadow us, but made himself available for any questions or needs.  When our car was delivered, we noticed a scratch in the door.  Upon our request, the salesman found us another SC2 in the exact color and options we wanted within a day.  Saturn actually made the purchase of our car easy and relaxing, during a stressful time after the accident.
