            We leased this 1998 Prizm new after pricing Corolla's. Toyota had so many trim levels and option packages that it reminded me of american cars of the 1960's. Chevy, on the other hand, had just two models: LSI and the Prizm Sedan. We opted for the sedan with several upgraded features, 4 speed automatic overdrive transmission, alloy wheels, CD player, rear defroster & tilt steering wheel. It's a little early in the game to draw any definitive conclusions about the long term performance of this vehicle but so far we've been pleased at the performance and reliability of our Prizm; having had no repairs needed in the three years that we've had it. Controls and gauges are logically and intuitively placed and operated, but I hate digitaly programed stereos!  The vehicle handles and is appointed like a mini-sports /luxury car with a very refined ride, terrific torque, passing power, sure and accurate steering and road feel with a distinct lack of idiosyncracies. The rear seat is definitely too tight for grownups on any sort of long trip and we've been averaging in mixed driving, heavy on the local non-highway kind, about 26 mpg. Not as good as we'd expected. Interior trim is simple but pleasant, and the standard cloth upholstery seems surprisingly robust. Road noise at highway speeds is considerable, but not having had to replace the tires, as yet, it could be them ( Firestone Fr 680 OEM's). Still, I expect to get many years of trouble free driving from this Toyota in disquise, and to that end we purchased it at the end of the lease. 
A word of caution: newer Prizms are not produced by NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing Inc, a joint venture of Toyota and GM )the 1998 was. Newer models assembled by GM alone could be equal or lower in quality. Some GM dealers seem happy to allow you to think that a joint assembly facility still exists although it doesn't.
