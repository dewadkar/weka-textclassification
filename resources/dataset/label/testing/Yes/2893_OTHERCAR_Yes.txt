            My very first car was 1992 Dodge Colt (with Mitsubishi made engine).
Here is how the story goes: I was a junior in college living on campus when I realized that this is about a right time to get some used car to drive around. What can be better as the small cute Dodge Colt 1992 for the price of $1000 (I bought it in 1997). I was extremely broke back then (living in residence halls, paying big $$ for food/room/school expenses). The Colt seemed to be like a great buy that time. So, I called that lady who posted her add in the local newspaper and got the car right away. 

The Colt was running great however, I found numerous problems to fix.  The car had 148K when I got it so, the following things were fixed while I owned it: 
1) Clutch (I noticed weird things while shifting after owning the car for about 3-4 months or so)
2) Water pump (I also noticed squeaky kind of sounds after 1 year of driving my first &quot;baby&quot;)

Also, I did regular engine tune up and oil changes.

The most irritating thing I found in Colt 92 was a problem starting when it was really cold (I got it around winter time so..go figure)...

ok..enough about bad things. Great things: since it was my very first car, I loved it with all my heart. The car is basically historic. It was connected with many things in my life, like college life, college parties, also, my jobs (I drove it off campus for work), trips to cities nearby (I drove it a lot to cities within 1-2 hours). 

Ignoring that fact of this car's earlier listed failures, it NEVER NEVER failed me while driving on interstate or anything like that. Few times I remember I thought it was going to die on me (I remember trying to start it for 15 minutes during one cold winter), but it started and drove me wherever I needed to go. I also loved the car's stereo, my Colt had a great stereo, much better than in Toyota I owned after the Colt.

I also loved the seats and the automatic seat belt. After my Colt, I was very spoiled with this automatic belt. So, it took some time to get used to Toyota and Honda's standard belts. The clutch was also designed very well not talking about wonderful mileage I always got.

What happened to my beloved Colt? Well, I carelessly crushed it one day after returning from a long and tiresome trip from out of state. When that happened, I couldn't believed it. The car associated with so many things in my life was FINISHED. Since I was out of college by the time I crushed it, I worked and could afford my second car -&gt; Toyota Corolla '91. It worked perfectly but it didn't have any personal feelings attached to it whatsoever. After driving it for a little while, I sold it to the car dealer and purchased a brand new Honda Civic EX Coupe 2000 just a couple months ago.

What happened to my Colt after the careless crush? Well, it was sitting in my yard for a while until I arranged to give it away to some parts' dealer or something. I couldn't see my very first car just sitting there with no purpose.

It was funny that even after this serious crush, Colt started and run just fine, it's just the body was totally smashed (lights, hood etc), so to fix it I would have to pay a fortune. Plus, the car was getting higher on mileage so, to keep it didn't make any sense at all.

Alright, I am finishing up this sad eulogy to my first Dodge.

Overall: wonderful car for students (high school / college)
