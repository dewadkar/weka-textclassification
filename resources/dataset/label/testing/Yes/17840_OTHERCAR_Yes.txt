            I drove a 4wd 4door Blazer for about two weeks, while on a trip in North Carolina. With the high gas prices, I think that a car would have been better, but the Blazer is actually big inside and for short trips, you can put people behind the second row of seats. This SUV doesn't have many nifty features like an Xterra. It's just your basic SUV. 

One major problem with this car is the lack of a V8. The V6 is powerful, but it is nothing like a V8 Explorer. On the highways the car accelerated sufficiently, but the engine did get pretty loud. You could hear it working to get up to 65 mph. This was also true on the streets; the engine did work a little harder than I would have liked. The suspension is also not that great either. Going over a curb to enter a driveway would cause some bumps which could be avoided with a better suspension system. It handles well for an SUV and has responsive steering. 

The interior is nicer than I had anticipated. All of the buttons are large (larger than necessary) and the windshield wiper controls are right next to the radio, not on a stick from the wheel like the turn signal. I never drove the Blazer in the rain, so I don't know if their placement of these controls would be a problem, but they didn't really seem to be in a great place. The stereo had a CD player and was fairly easy to use. The buttons were big and ugly, but they weren't confusing. The speakers were very good, and could handle the large amounts of bass that I fed them. The stereo is one area that I was impressed by. 

The seats are very comfortable in the front and a little low to the floor in the back. The front seats feel a little like a sports car, you sit low to the floor and your feet extend far forward, but they were still nice. They were supportive and didn't get uncomfortable. The back seats were also comfortable, but were a little too low to the floor. There was a good amount of legroom in the back, more than other SUVs I have been in, but still not an overwhelming amount. The headroom was also good in the front and rear. 

I never drove the Blazer off-road, so I don't know how it would handle. But, for most people this isn't a problem (the Lexus RX sells very well as a luxury SUV). It is based on the S-10 truck platform, so it can do more than other car based SUVs, but it's not a Land Rover. 

The exterior of the Blazer isn't that exciting or attractive, but it's not ugly. It looks very basic, and appeals to a wide range of people. It has a basic look, like the Explorer although it isn't as nice. 

I would recommend the Blazer to a family that lives in a northern region that has snow in the winters. It is powerful enough to get around in snow and a little off-roading. It can be purchased at a competitive price, and has some nice features. <br><br>
