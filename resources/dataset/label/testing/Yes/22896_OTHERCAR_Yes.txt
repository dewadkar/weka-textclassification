            Depending on what your looking for - the 240sx is NOT for everyone.  If your looking for a small punchy "quick off the line" car that gets decent gas mileage, will get you through the years on basic maintananceing with of course great reliability, then your looking in the right direction.  However, if going up on the expressway looking for porsches, vette's, mustangs and 3000GT's dont bother.

I have owned my 1990 240sx for a year now.  Making this car over 12 years old and counting.  Maybe 12 years ago 140 bhp would have cut it, but today most cars are coming off the line with 225-275 horses and some.  However, with its rear wheel drive, punchy pick up and surprisingly smooth drive this car will win you over.  With some minor upgrades in the 500 dollar area you can turn your 140bhp into 175hp easily, bringing you into competition with some of todays more prized vehicles.  I have upgraded my intake, exhaust, spark plugs/and wires and coil.  Let me tell ya! This car outperforms my old Ford Probe GT which had a 6 Cyl DOHC engine.  I am impressed. Now, bringing it down a notch for those who are not to car savvy.

This car may not be the best for all around seasons drivers for these reasons.  In the winter, due to the light weight of the car, and it being rear wheel drive, the car will literally slide off the road during ANY light weight snow storm.  However, in rain showers it handles like a dream (except for those gusher windy ones).

Also, whoever designed the back seats should be shot.  Your lucky if you could fit two very small migits back there.  Terrible!  Overall - Price vs. Product, your getting a deal!
