            I bought this camera 6 months ago because i needed a camera for auctions.i ordered mine online for around 300 dollars at the time because i had heard many good reviews on it.it was very easy to install the drivers and the software programs it came with.i took many pictures with it and was very pleased with the results.at the highest resolution it took great photos .at the other resolutions it took pretty good photos also.

the thing i like most about it was the compact size of it,you could fit it in your shirt pocket if you wanted too.it comes in a few different colors,mine was the millenium edition which is gold and comes with an 8 m b memory card compared to the 4 m b card which comes with the silver version.the millenium edition also comes with a usb card reader which makes loading the photos onto your computer fast,the silver version doesn't have the usb card reader.the only thing i can say bad about this camera is that it eats batteries pretty fast,so your better off getting rechargeable ones with the camera.trust me ,it will save you a lot of money on batteries.

this product is perfect for the beginner who doesn't want to spend 5 or 6 hundred dollars for a first camera.i think you will be very satisfied with the purchase.<br><br>
