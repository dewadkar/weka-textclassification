            After owning several used cars since I was 16yrs old, I decided I wanted some dependable and would last me for years to come.  After convincing my parents it was time for me to start looking to get something dependable and brand new they decided I was right. I was to do my own research and pick out the cars I wanted that I could afford then they would go to town with me to test drive the ones I picked out.  

I used http://www.autobytel.com to do my car research.  It helped me find cars in the size, price range I needed.  I narrowed my search down to a Kia car and a Hyundai Accent.

One of the closer dealers for Kia and Hyundai (sister companies) is Tulsa, Oklahoma so that is where I headed to test drive the cars I was interested in.

After test driving the Kia Sophia and having the salesman give the run around then try to sell me a used car I went to Hyundai.  I told them which car I wanted to test drive so they went immidiately and got the keys and backed it out for me so I could drive it. I was fixin to meet the rest of my family for lunch and said I would be back after lunch to test drive it and fill out papers. They told me to take it to lunch and keep it was long as I needed then come back and fill out paperwork.  I came back and the salesman were very nice to me still. I filled out the paperwork and they helped me find a bank that would loan me the money.  

When I was finally approved for the loan, I asked for a full tank of gas and they washed the car for me and got it ready for me to take home. After they got it ready for me to go..they took me on a tour of their dealership and introduced me the guy in the service dept. that would service my car if I brought it in or help me if I had any problems.  

After spending approximately an hour or two in the Hyundai's office, I left with a brand new car and a loan for 5yrs on it.  I was completely happy with the car and the service I received.  

My car isn't meant for large or tall people.. It is a small 4 dr car.. a pretty shade of green.  It gets good gas mileage..but then do I have time to go anywhere but home and work sometimes. It has a 10 gallon gas tank and I fill it up every other week.  It doesn't have any fancy features like electric windows or cruise control but that is okay with me cause those are just features that tend to go out and cost a fortune to fix.  

I have had the car a year now and its required no service work.. The seatbelt on the passengers side tends to stick but I haven't had the time nor money to go to Tulsa to take the car to the dealership to let them fix it. I had a bad tire on the car and they replaced it for me. It made it up a pretty steep hill in the snow and had no problems while my sister's 98 Dodge Neon couldn't make it up the snow.   

I have a 5 year/100,000 mile warranty for the car that came with it. The car costs around $10,000-$12,000.  The car came with window tinting and a child seat attachment that goes into the back dashboard in your car(and it suppose to be installed free by the dealer when I need it).  It has dual airbags.  

I think the only regret I have about this car is that I should of bought the sporty packaged Accent since it already came with fog lights in it and a spoiler. I can't get those accessories for my car cause they are either too expensive or not made yet.  

12/23/00 Update:

I have had this car over a year now.. I did some research on the net and found they had a recall on my car for transmission work but I was never notified by Hyundai, a little disappointing.  Then I had a tire that was out of round and they had me bring the tire to the dealer and they got me a new one for free.  

My pretty little green car was hit while I was at work at Sonic by a careless driver who sideswipped my car.  Actually it didn't do too much damage and it wasn't all that costly for his insurance company to have a body shop repair my car. Now the car has been fixed and looks like it was never sideswipped in the first place.  

I have had this car for almost 2yrs now and still love my car.  I am dreaming of the next vehicle I want which will be a little SUV but in the meantime I love my little car.  After the first of the year I will take my car to the dealer for recall work to be done the seat belt on the passenger side to be fixed.  

Still no engine problems or other mechanical problems.  It gets around great still, and great gas mileagle plus its the only Hyundai Accent in my area so I don't have something everyone else has.  I finally located fog lights and a spoiler for my car through a company on the net that sells forgien car accessories but it turned out the fog lights were the wrong shape for my car.  

Overall this car has been great.  My sisters 98 Dodge Neon is almost 3 yrs old and always has some kind of problem. And with only 12,000 miles on it my time limit on my warranty will be up before the mileage part is up.  

Update for July 2003

I have had this car 4 years now and have a year left on my car loan. The car has approximately 47,000 miles on it at the this time.  Overall this has been a great car and didn't have any problems until this week when the transmission went out without any notice. Stopped at the grocery store and came out to find the reverse gear in the transmission had gone out and 1st gear was going out too.  

Hyundai gave me free roadside assistance until 2009 so I took advantage of that and called them to come pick up my car. I got the choice of which dealer to have it towed to that location to be fixed.  I needed a replacement car to get around town in, until mine was fixed.  I found out Hyundai does NOT offer you a loaner car while yours is being fixed.  I called around to different Hyundai dealers in a 100 mile radius and finally found one in Springdale, Arkansas that was willing to loan me a car while mine was in the shop.  I was more than thrilled so I had the car towed to that location. I live NE Oklahoma so Springdale, Arkansas is a 71 mile trip one way.  The dealer I bought it was about a 60 mile drive one day so an extra 10 miles wasn't too bad.  

Hyundai found a local tow truck to come pick up my car and towed it to Springdale, AR for free for me.  The next day the shop called and said they recieved my car and the transmission was out. They was not going to fix the transmission but instead would replace it.  I could come pick up a loaner car at anytime. I could not make it to Springdale, AR til today to get one.  I recieved a 2003 Hyundai Elantra to drive until mine is fixed. Due the Holiday weekend mine won't be ready til next weekend.  

Not sure I am impressed that the transmission went out in my car after 4 years.  I am happy my warranty covers the problem so this problem doesn't cost me anything but time.  My boyfriend is trying to convience me to buy the Elantra I am currently loaned to drive but not sure I want to own another Hyundai or another car period since I am so close to getting my own car paid off.
