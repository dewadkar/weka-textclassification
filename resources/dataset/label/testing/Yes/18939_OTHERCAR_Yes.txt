            I LOVED THIS CAR.  In April 2001, my husband and I decided that with the rising gas prices in our area our best decision was to sell my 1998 1/2 ton Chevy pickup for a car. At first I was hesitant because I would no longer have 4 wheel drive, we live in the snow belt, but after long consideration, and adding in the factors of large repair bills on trucks, and mine no longer had a warranty I agreed.  I was dead set on only buying a car that offered a very long warranty and looked very good. We pulled into the Mitsubishi dealership and I immediatley fell in love with the Galant.  We test drove it and I knew immediatly that I would seetle with nothing but the Galant. We looked at every Galant ES-V6 on the lot and finally decided on my baby, a silver 4 door, with very light grey interiour. I was still torn between my truck and this car.  Well as luck would have it the Galant had a $2500 rebate on it witch allowed me to purchase a 100,000 mile extended waranty.  That was the selling point for me.  We drove it off the lot about 1 hr later.  The best part of this car was the handling, it drove so smooth and took corners with such presion I was blowen away.  From the outside it was gorgeous.  I often found myself driving buy those stores that have the big front windows and gazing at this awsome work of the Japanize.  The interior was very comfortable, never prompting a complaint from me or my husband.  It allowed ample room for the front and rear riders in the vehicle.  I must say this car turned many heads around town, we live in a fairly remote location, and there isn't a Mitsubishi dealership for about 150 miles.  It looked like a very expensive car, but in my opionion it was a mid priced vehicle.  The only thing that I wished Mitsubishi would consider, is to put a remote trunk release on the key less entry pad.  Mitsubishi also has a fairly new anti-theft device also, if someone tries to steal the car it will shut down the systems in the car and you have a code specific to each car that you enter into the sterio and I will reset itself allowing you to start and drive the vehicle.  I really liked this idea, although it kind of halted my thoughts of putting an after market CD Player in the car.  It really ended up being no big deal though because it already had a sufficient cd player stock.  The trunk of this car was perfect for storing our monstroserous stroller, and to this point I have not found another car that could accomidate that stroller.  The engine of this car was also very good, it was very powerful, and it excelerates wonderfully quick.  Living in the snow belt we were also concerned with the handling in snow.  On morning I got up for work at 4am, looked out the window, and sure enough we had about 12" of snow on the ground.  I jumped in the Mitsi, and away I went,I couln't belive my eyes it cut through the snow wonderfully.  I was blowen away with the handling and the manuverability of this car.  There were 4 wheel drive pickups in the ditch and I was cutting right through. This was the best vehicle I have ever driven in the snow.  That morining at work I was one of only five that made it to work that day, and our crew was 50+.  After a year owning this car, I decided to become a stay at home mom, so the only way I could leave my job was to sell my baby.  I still regret it once and a while, but I couldn't put a car ahead of my son.  If you have a chance to own one of these wonderfu;l vehicles I would strongly recommend it to anyone.  I Loved It, and I miss it very much.
