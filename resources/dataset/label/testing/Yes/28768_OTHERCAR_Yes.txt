            Wow!!!  If you can pick up a 1990 Lincoln Continental that has been very well maintained, you will have a luxury car at a bargain price.  The going price for these cars is $900 to $4000 depending on the condition.  In 2002, this car is 11 to 12 years old.  Be careful that the previous owners took good care of it.  

The car that I bought is in perfect running condition and will require some paint.  The previous owners have made the repairs of the alternator, head gaskets twice, brake air suspension on four wheels (very expensive), and air conditioning reconditioned.  

The condition of the car at 120,000 miles is:  Runs smooth as if it were new, starts perfectly, body excellent but needs a new paint job because of the sun, the interior trim needs some replacing at the handles, easy to steer, brakes well, radio speakers not too good, but I can fix that, one door window doesn't work, the seats are so comfortable that you feel like going to a parking lot and just sitting there.  I love driving around town in this car.  The moonroof works perfectly!

The size is COMPACT for a Lincoln Continental.  So you are really buying a Ford Taurus sized car.  It has very roomy back seats.  It is a little big for me when parking or backing up.  People are in definite envy when they see me driving a Lincoln Continental.  They don't realize, I only paid $2500.00 for it.  I am thrilled with this car!
