            I bought a 1997 Silhouette when they first came out with the new design.  It was reasonably priced, had the equipment I wanted and more.  In the first 45 days of ownership, we put over 6,000 miles on this van and it performed admirably.  We now have put over 53,000 miles on it and it is still running pretty well.  there have been some glitches which I hope Olds has fixed in their newer models.  We have had repeated problems with the electric sliding door, fixed under warranty.  The dealer installed replacement brake pads wore out in less than 10,000 miles, much worse than after-market pads. The serpentine belt wore out at about 50,000 miles.  The Delco battery split and had to be replaced after only 26 months.  The biggest thing that I wished for was more Power;  Olds has put a little more power in the newer models, fortunately.  Dealer service has been great - Galles Olds in Albuquerque.  If I were to buy another new car, it would be through Galles.  They do treat their customers right.I would not recommend the new Premier Olds Silhouette.  It is overpriced;  you can get an after-market TV/VCR combo for less than $500.00 in a unit that fits between the two front captain's chairs.<br>   <br><br><br>
