            This vehicle is great if you own children. It has enough seat belts to fit seven people but the leg and cargo space are still huge. The trunk on this van is great, it is spacious and can be adjusten easily space wise by sliding the seats forward. All of the back seats can be slid back and forth or can be taken out. The seats are on wheels so after you disengage their locking system they roll out easily. The seat are interchangeable so you can put the three person bench seat in the middle of the van and have a huge cargo space in the back with only giving up two seats. This Van is a must have for all families with two or more kids who need space and love to travel by road.<br><br>
