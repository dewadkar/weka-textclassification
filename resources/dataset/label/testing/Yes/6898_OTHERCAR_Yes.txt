            Imagine my luck when I went to pick up my BMW 325 recently and found that the mechanics had lost the keys.  I had to leave for Pittsburgh before the service department was going to open the following day and, therefore, was provided with their last loner- a 5 Series- for the following six days.  Hallelujah!  When I returned the keys I told the service manager to be sure to lose my keys more often.

I spent the week driving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and then in and around Pittsburgh.  I hit 90 MPH on the highway and took tight turns without a sweat.  I suffered through traffic jam after traffic jam.  I enjoyed every single minute of it.  So much so, that I seriously considered trading  my car in.  Of course, I then quickly remembered that we had just purchased a home, had a wedding coming up, and did not need a new car.  Oh well, a man can dream, right?

THE SPECIFICS:

*  225hp, 3.0 liter, 24 valve DOHC inline six cylinder 
   engine
*  Top speed of 128 MPH (0-60MPH in 6.8 seconds)
*  21 MPG in the city and 30 MPG on the highway
*  Direct ignition system
*  Five speed manual transmission
*  Front and rear anti-roll bars
*  Rain sensor wiper blades
*  Heated windshield washers jets
*  Halogen headlights and fog lights
*  Anti-theft AM/FM CD stereo with 10 speakers 
*  12 way power sport seats with memory settings
*  Side impact head protection system and rear headbags
*  Daylight automatic running lights


I really could go on and on with the features and specifics of the 5 Series, but for the sake of space I will leave it with I have above.  Needless to say, the car is about as loaded as you will find for anything remotely close to this price.

WHAT I LIKED:

1.  I have driven a 3 Series for the past five years and always felt it was a very good car.  It lends an aura of sophistication (Needed when you are as silly as I am.) and performs well in every condition with the exception of snow. I have always heard that the 5 Series is at another level.  What I heard was correct.  Sure, some of the next level is from the car being half a decade newer, but there is also something to be said for a better car altogether.

2.  From a driving perspective, the 5 Series is a wonder. The car is fast, handles well, and is quiet.  The pickup was impressive, but not out of this world.  Then again, you are not looking for out of this world in regards to speed with this car.  You want impressive speed and pick up, but not a rocket like a Porsche.  You also have excellent handling, but not like a Porsche.  All of this comes with a car that literally locks out all of the outside noise and clutter that is so often associated with highway driving. 

3.  The ride is smooth as can be.  Ok, here is where I had some trouble.  I would be driving along the PA Turnpike and not realize that I was going 90 MPH.  The 5 Series is such a smooth ride that you do not ever get the feeling that you are moving as quickly as you are.  A great feature, but also one that you have to watch out for or the cops will find you interesting.

4.  The safety features are plentiful.  Thankfully, I never got to try them out while on my trip.  However, the 5 Series has two roll bars, side and rear airbags to go along with the normal front airbags.  As you read the owners manual you will also notice that the 5 Series has an automatic fuel cut off when the air bags get deployed and a door anchor system that is supposed to help prevent injuries in side impacts.  Whoa.  Finally, there are automatic- come on with the ignition- day light running lights that make it easier for you to be seen.

5.  The sound system.  WOW!  Now keep in mind that in order to have a great sound system, you have to minimize outside interference.  I already mentioned that the outside sound is minimal to the extent that I might not hear the space shuttle taking off right next to me.  Hence, the sound system begins on good footing.  The system features 10 speakers that produce a beautiful, rich, and full sound that will impress even the most discriminating audio aficionados.  The CD player is placed below the air conditioner controls and vents and out of view for the most part.  The stereo controls are well thought out and easy to use.  All in all, the sound is wonderful.

6.  The size.  While my 3 Series sometimes can be a tight fit- especially the trunk- the 5 Series has plenty of room.  I was able to fit two medium size bags, a golf bag, and a briefcase in the trunk without the slightest problem. I could not have done this with my 3 Series.  The interior is roomy as well.  One of the individuals who I do business with in Pittsburgh is 6"7 and he had no difficulty with the leg room or height of the car.  The bottom line is that if you are trading up from a 3 Series, the size difference is substantial.

7.  All of the automatic stuff.  Huh?  Stuff like doors that lock when you begin to move.  The day light running lights.  The one touch power windows.  The memory availability with the mirrors and seats.  The heated drivers side door lock and windshield washer jets.  The automatic dimming of the rear view mirror.  The doors that lock shortly after the car is turned off and parked. The rain sensing windshield wipers.  All of this stuff is automatic and done to make you life easier and more convenient.

8.  Location of the controls.  The 5 Series has moved virtually all of their controls to the steering wheel.  You can change the stereo/CD functions, channels, and volume from the steering wheel (A Big plus given that recent studies seem to show that the biggest distraction for drivers is the constant fidgeting with the radio or CD player.)  along with cruise control.  The steering wheel placement helps you to keep your eyes on the road, but does take a little time to get accustomed to.  However, I loved it once I was used to it.

9.  The compartments.  Yeah, I know, a little something, but something that we all need.  The cup holder, for instance, can secure a can of Coke or a 32 ounce bottle of water.  A nice touch.  The glove compartment can actually hold something more than five CD's and a map.  The rear seats can be lowered for moving something that is too long to fit in the trunk.  Both the front and rear doors have storage compartments.

10. Finally, the feeling that I was in a really nice car. Yeah, my 3 Series is a nice car, but this is a really nice car.  The advances are significant and noticeable.  I was actually happy that I would not be driving my car to Pittsburgh, despite not having some of my materials, my golf clubs, and other travel accessories that I always have with me when I travel.  The 5 Series was that much of a joy to drive.

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE:

1.  There is a pretty significant blind spot.  If you try to look over your left shoulder while driving to see if there is a car off the rear of your car, you will have a tough time.  The spot is more blind than with most cars.

2.  The stereo skips a lot of what I would consider fine channels.  What I mean is that if there is a hint of static, the scan feature will completely skip the station. I went for a couple hundred miles in the middle of Pennsylvania where the scan would stop on only three or four stations.  A minor annoyance that is balanced by the ability to receive Philly stations two hours from home.

3.  I had trouble getting the seats to fit my backside.  I was fine on the way out, but spent the entire five hours coming home trying to find the right setting.  Of course, I did not take the time to learn how to set the memory functions, but I was surprised at how difficult it was to get comfortable.

4.  The locking of the doors when exiting the car is good and bad.  I do not necessarily want to have my doors locked when walking into a convenience store, but they will lock anyway.  No big deal and a feature that I guess I would rather have than not, but also one that can be annoying at times.

THE BOTTOM LINE:

The title for this epinion is, "Avoid at All Costs Unless..." and the reason you should avoid this car is that it is addictive.  Yes, it is that good.  It boasts the pickup of a sports car with the room of a sedan and the features of, well, very few other cars.  The 5 Series is truly a joy to drive because of everything; the handling, the power, the features, the sound system.  I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new car.  I am now truly hoping that the service department will lose my keys more often.
