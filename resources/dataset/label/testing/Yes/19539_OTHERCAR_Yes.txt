            I leased my Tercel when I graduated from college because I had no down payment for a car.  Toyota has a nice college grad program with nothing down &amp; no deposit, just your first lease payment.

My Tercel is the &quot;Blackhawk&quot; limited edition.  It is a sporty looking 2-dr which has some nice extras like a spoiler, nice CD player, and polycast wheels.  You can drive a LONG way on a tank of gas, which is great.  I have never had one trip to the mechanic (besides regular maintenance) in 3 years &amp; 41,000 miles.  I have been very happy with this car overall.

There are just a few minor irritations to speak of.  The cover on the center console is attached with tiny screws that always work themselves out, so the cover always comes off.  The seats get uncomfortable on long trips.  There is some road &amp; wind noise when driving.  There is a rattle in the dash &amp; a rattle by the back seat which  gets kind of irritating at times.

For this sized car with no power windows, no power locks, no cruise, etc....I think it was kind of pricey.  But then again, it is a Toyota and I never had a problem with it.  My lease will be up in a couple of months and I will be turning my tercel in...but mainly because I want something bigger.<br><br>
