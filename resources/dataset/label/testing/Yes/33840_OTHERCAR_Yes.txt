            This vehicle was actually purchased by my wife back in early 1993.  She had previously had a Volkswagen Jetta that she loved, but it wasn't very high in quality (she tells me).  She bought the Honda because her job required she drive a lot and thought because of Honda's high reliability, this would be a good choice.  She purchased the Accord LX model.

The car has been very good.  She regularly gets 30mpg...not quite as good as my Saturn, but it does have more room.  

What we love about this car is the room.  Granted, we either have this or a Saturn SL2 to drive, but it's still nicely sized.  It drives very nicely.  I recently replaced the crappy Firestones with Michelin X-One's and the improvement was dramatic.  

The only real problems I have with the car are some fit problems (the seal around the driver's door window doesn't seat right) and the fact that there is no room to work on the motor.

Let's address these:
The driver's door has a piece of plastic trim on the exterior that runs top to bottom on the trailing edge of the window.  There is about a 3/16&quot; gap at the top of this trim.  Over the years, this gap allowed the rubber gasket to &quot;walk&quot; and produced a horrible howling noise at speed unless you stopped the car and pushed the window in from the outside.  This worked until you rolled the window down again.  My wife said it started doing this not long after she purchased the car and she took it in under warranty and they &quot;adjusted&quot; the window.  It's obvious that the trim/guide needed replacement/realignment.  Well, recently we took the car in and paid Honda to replace the gasket.  $100 gone.  But so is the howling.  The trim, however is still odd-fitting.  Good thing we don't plan to keep the car too many more years.

As for the work-room under the hood...I decided a couple years ago to replace the timing belts.  They had over 150K miles on them, so it was needed.  Honda wanted to charge me $400 to do this.  The belts were available at NAPA for less than $45.  I figured I could do this easily.  I was wrong.  It took my father and myself over 4 1/2 hours to do the job.  You have to actually disconnect the motor mounts and SHOVE the motor back in it's cradle to remove the timing belt shields.  Score one for Honda.  They know how to make sure you'll pay them next time.

But the Accord has just over 198K on the odometer and it's still going strong.  With a new baby on the way, we probably will have to trade it for a new car soon.  Someone will get a very good deal on a very good car.

This car would make a nice starter car for a teenager.  It probably would be appreciated more by a young woman, but I've seen guys driving them, too.<br><br>
