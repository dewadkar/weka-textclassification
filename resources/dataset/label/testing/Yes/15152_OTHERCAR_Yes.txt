            The <b>Toshiba PDR-M60</b> is a mid-price camera with the quality &amp; features that other pricier cameras have.

The camera also has buttons for image quality, flash, macro, display and timer allowing on the fly adjustments. Photos can be taken with the LCD monitor on or turn it off to save on batteries and use the viewfinder.

The cards are capable of storing from 3 to 907 images, depending on the quality images and what Smart Media card you use. The lens is glass with a built-in lens cap.

Settings to adjust quality/size from fine, normal or basic JPEG compression ratios to sizes of 1792 x 1200 pixel to 896 x 600 pixel for the single images. A multiple picture setting takes 16 continuous images in one frame. This is a handy feature for making short movie clips.

Picture quality settings allow changes to the sensitivity and color of the images to be recorded and they are, ISO100 equivalent to color film speed of ISO100, ISO200 is equivalent to color film ISO200, ISO400 is equivalent to color ISO400. A B&amp;W setting is a neat feature for the creative photographer. A built-in flash has auto flash, always on/off and a bulb setting for night and artistic photography by lengthening exposure time, which is adjustable from one to two seconds.
