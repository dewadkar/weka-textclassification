            I have always driven Fords.  When I went looking for a minivan, naturally I looked at Windstar first.  Then I saw the Sedona.  Sorry, Ford, you lost this time.

I wound up buying a Sedona EX with the Homelink, sunroof, leather, and ABS options for $21,000 (including the $1,000 rebate).

Features

The Sedona EX packs extras only found on the Windstar SEL or higher trims.  Dual power seats (power lumbar and tilt on driver's) with power recline, dual air, wiper de-icer, power locks, power windows (front and rear quarter), remote keyless entry, 4 bucket seats, heated power mirrors, aluminum wheels, and trip computer are all standard on the EX.

All the creature comforts are here.  About the only things missing are a CD changer and automatic heat/air with separate driver/passenger/rear temperature controls.  Oddly enough, a spring-loaded coinholder is also not included.


Fit and Finish

The overall construction seems solid and sound.  Everything seems to fit together well.  The only knock I have is that the outer door handles seem cheaply made and finished.  They aren't to the standard I would expect on a vehicle in this class.  Also, the middle bucket seats seem to have a problem with locking out of fold-down position, which has to be watched carefully.

Reliability

So far, 10,000 miles, and the only problem we have had is that the left rearmost seat belt got twisted inside the retractor mechanism.  Other than that, solid as a rock.

Driveability

Other than a slight lack of headroom (I'm 6'1"), fairly pronounced body roll through turns, and an overlarge turning radius, the Sedona is a pleasure to drive.  The 3.5L V6 responds quickly and accelerates smoothly and effectively.  ABS allows quick stops under control.  The first driving we did with this van was to take it on a 2500-mile vacation.  It was a breeze to drive on both the interstate and on 2-laners, providing both ease of handling and excellent seating comfort (although having the ceiling brush against my hair can be somewhat annoying).

The Sedona's gas mileage is about the worst in class (15/20 vs. most of the others being 18/24).  The price savings will buy you a lot of gas, however.

Overall

I have driven Fords for years.  My previous three new vehicle purchases were a 1988 Taurus, a 1992 E150 with a Waldoch conversion, and a 1996 Taurus.  This time Ford couldn't show me why I should stay with them.  To get the features I wanted required going up to the Windstar SEL trim, and I was looking at $24,500 after rebate.  I just couldn't bring myself to pay the extra $3,500 to stay with Ford after I drove the Sedona.

Sorry, Ford.  I still love you, but I guess not $3,500 worth.  Oh, and the Kia warranty kicks your tail too.
