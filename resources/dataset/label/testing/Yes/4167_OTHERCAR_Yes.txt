            This is a great luxury car for the price.  My wife and I are very satisfy with purchase of our 1999 Cadillac DeVille.  In June of 99,  we decided it was time to buy and negotiated a very good deal.
The ride is extremely smooth and comfortable.  No wind noises, No rattles, No bumps.  Just as expected form a luxury car.  The most often use controls such as; temperature control, volume control, band selection, etc. are on the steering wheel within finger tip reach.   The car is total power from windows to seats.  In addition, it features leather seats,  front and rear air, individual air and heat control as well as individual adjusting seat.  The rear and side view mirrors are set to reduced the blinding effects of high beam lights.  
The 4.6L Northstar engine provide as much  power as needed.  This engine will quietly move over the speed limit without you realizing it.  So be careful.   Passing another car is a breeze.
The four door sedan style is really great for this type of luxury car.  The color we got is moonstone which sparkles in the sunlight.   The car has a extra large trunk that my wife loves very much for shopping.  I am sure no one will be dissatisfy with this luxury car. <br><br>
