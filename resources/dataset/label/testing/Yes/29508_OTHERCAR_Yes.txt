                 I bought the Kodak DC-240 over the Christmas holidays.  I bought it because I love to take pictures.  The camera I already had (and still have) was an advantix photo system camera.  The reason I liked the advantix system so much was because of the index print.  It made it easy to decide which pictures you like and want to get reprints made of.  The DC-240 is even simpler than that.  You can view the picture on the camera as soon as you take it and if you don't like it you can delete it right then and there.  If you don't delete it, it doesn't mean that you have to print it either.  You simply print what you want to.  There are also services on the internet that you can send your pictures to via e-mail and they will mail you actual photos.  
     This camera is easy to use and is good for beginners and pros.  
     The major downfall to this camera is that it eats up batteries.  It comes with two sets of batteries.  One set consists of Kodak rechargeable batteries and the other set is regular batteries.  Also included is a battery charger which holds the four Kodak batteries and plugs into the wall.  Given the short battery life I suggest purchasing an AC adapter to use when uploading pictures from your camera to your computer.  This is a lengthy process and the most draining on the batteries.  Better yet is an accessory that you can plug into your computer instead of your camera to upload your pictures.  It is a device called scandisk and you can insert your memory card into it to upload pictures.  
     The Kodak DC-240 comes with an 8 MB memory card.  Memory cards are also available in 16, 24, 48, and 64 MB.  These will allow you to save more pictures at one time.  An 8 MB card saves about as many pictures as a 24 frame roll of film would if you use the good quality setting instead of best.  Of course after you upload or delete pictures you can use it over again.
     I spent $499 on my Kodak DC-240.  I chose the Kodak DC-240 because it was the cheapest digital camera with a zoom feature.  It was in the same price range at the Olympus that also had a zoom feature, but I chose Kodak for the name.  I think the investment was worth it and will pay off in the long run, saving money on film and processing.<br><br>
