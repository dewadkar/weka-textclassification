             We bought this car new in Colorado, since then we have put on nearly 40k and it has been to North Carolina, Maryland, and South Carolina. Our 1998 SE came with a lot of standard features such as: 190 hp engine,traction control, ABS, A/C, AM/FM cassette stereo, power windows, power mirrors, power locks, cruise control, tilt steering, 16-inch aluminum wheels, fog lights. We also opted for: automatic transmission,Bose sound system, CD player, keyless entry, Homelink transceiver, power sunroof, and power driver's seat.

The interior is nicely designed with the multi-colored dash to give it that uptown look. All the buttons are easy to read, understand, and are soft to the touch. There is also alot of room for all the knick knacks (CD's, cell phones,etc). I only have two complaints about the interior of this car. One is the legroom for the rear passengers, I would really say this is a car for the driver. Secondly, there are rattling sounds not in the sunroof like you would expect, but in the pillars in the rear.

There are also no complaints here as far as the ride and drive is concerned. The car is smooth and quiet. It is true you can hear the tires over the engine-and the tires don't hardly make any noise. The engine provides strong, smooth torque throughout the rev range, and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly and changes gears quickly to suit driving conditions. The steering just lacks the feel and precision that this type of car should have. There also seems to be a hint of understeer at higher speeds, the usual for a front-wheel-drive sedan.
