            When we purchased our Silhouette, we were a little bit nervous.  Our last experience buying a new car had left us by the wayside feeling well a little sore in the bottom region.  We looked at several models but had never even considered buying an Oldsmobile.  I guess we thought that they were for older folks and probably more expensive than we wanted.  However while looking at the Ventures that were sitting on the same lot, my husband and I glanced over and saw the Silhouettes sitting on the other side of the lot.  One test drive and we were sold. And comparing prices, well the Silhouette and the Dodge Caravan are equal in price, but you get more for this money with the Silhouette than on the Caravan. 

Our Silhouette is the most comfortable vehicle we have ever owned.  Our kids just love the dual sound system. Traveling is now so much more pleasant than before.  My 6' 4&quot; husband no longer complains of feeling cramped up after our 4 hour jaunts to Houston to see the family.  

I told my husband that I do not ever want to own another vehicle that isn't an Olds.  Buy one today and you won't be dissappointed.<br><br>
