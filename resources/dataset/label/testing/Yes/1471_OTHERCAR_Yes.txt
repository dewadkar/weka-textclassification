            My wife sells cars at a dealership and I get to test drive many cars. I recently purchased a Nissan Xterra but today my wife brought home a Cadillac Escalade and it is making me wonder about my purchase of the Xterra.

Lets start With comfort. Lots of what Cadillac callsSoft Nuance Leather. The leather is extremely soft and it covers seats that are supportive and of luxury comfort. Also in the interior the Escalade sports a lot of wood trim, a nice touch. There are many cupholders. The front seat has three power outlets and there's one in the rear seat and one in the cargo area. 

The wheels are 16 inch chrome wheels which give the car another distinctive look.

You will  be surprised to find that this Caddy doesn't have memory seats or automatic climate controls. It doesn't offer Cadillac's new massaging seat option or a Northstar engine. You will find heated seats, OnStar  service, and an absolutely incredible Bose acoustic mass sound system with cassette, a single slot CD, a 6-CD changer and rear seat controls with two separate headphones for rear seat passengers. 

The rear seat folds 60/40, but the seatback is made in such a way that the seat back doesn't really latch into place. Space is good, as one would expect of a full-size SUV. My wife tells me that you can chose between a door that swings up or a split tailgate. The split tailgate puts a large blind spot dead center of the mirror, so try before you buy. The cargo area has a retractable cargo cover and a cargo net for smaller items. 

This Suv is equipped with a 255 horsepower engine . The ride is extremely pleasant. This would be a great commute car. Brake with front disc/rear drum brakes equipped with four-wheel-anti-lock standard. 



Mileage is rated 13 mpg city, 16 mpg highway, just about typical for the class. This truck was enjoyable was an all around joy.
