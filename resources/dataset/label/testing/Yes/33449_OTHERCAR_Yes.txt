              <b>A</b>fter the RX-7's Lemans win in 1991, Mazda unveiled it's 3rd generation version of its most historical sports car, which was first introduced in 1978, and made its departure from the U.S automotive industry in 1995. While the RX7 does not boast the quickest 0-60 times on the planet, it no doubt can boast one of the most desirable cars on the used automotive market.

<i>Driving Impressions:</i> 

  <b>The Rx-7</b> comes standard with a 1.3 liter twin rotor Wankel engine with twin turbos bolted on to give an impressive 255 HP and 217 lb-ft of torque. Off-the-line <b>acceleration</b> in the '93 RX-7 is simply amazing! Even with only 1.3 liters, and peak power reached at a relatively high RPM (6,500), the engine coupled with a smooth shifting 5-speed manual transmission (a 4 speed automatic is optional) gives enough power at take-off to push you back in your seat tell you hit 4th gear. There's no turbo lag whatsoever, and the engine runs very quickly to 4,000  RPM with the sound only a twin turbo rotary engine can make. The RX-7 also does very well on hills at freeway speeds, no need to down-shift to 4th gear on most inclines, just a push on the throttle sends this machine up the steepest of hills without fuss. 

<b>Handling</b> in the RX-7 can be a little scary at first, but once the driver adjusts he or she is welcomed with one of the best handling sports cars ever made. The steering is razor sharp, and the Rx-7 responds instantly to the drivers input. 

<b>Cruising</b> is not really the Rx-7's strong points. On a few trips in this car on Interstate 5 I really got to feel what this car was like on the freeway, the Rx-7 is affected by wind, engine, and road noise, especially speeds over 75 mph. The ride is extremely rock hard, and sometimes punishing. The '93 Rx-7 comes in two packages, the Touring and R1. 
<b>NOTE:</b> My test Rx-7 was an R1, the 'Touring' package comes with a softer suspension, so if you are looking for a softer ride the 'Touring' package might be your best choice. The Rx-7's high performance is matched by its <b>Braking</b>, 4 wheel vented disc brakes are provided along with 4 wheel ABS. 
<b>NOTE:</b> Expect to get around 23 MPG on the freeway. 

 The 1993 Mazda Rx-7 is rear wheel drive, sits on a relatively small 95.5" wheelbase, and has an overall length of 168.5". <b>Suspension</b> consists of double unequal-length alloy wishbones, coil springs,telescope shocks, and an anti roll bar. 

<b>A little info about this amazing little engine:</b> The Rx-7 uses an extremely light 1.3 liter Wankel engine. Compared to a conventional piston engine, there are very few moving parts, only the rotors and the output shaft (like the crankshaft in a normal engine). Perfect balance means it can rev very high. The main success of the Rx-7's amazing power per liter output is thanks to the twin-turbo installation which forces the fuel mixture through ports uncovered in the rotor housing as the rotors sweep around.

<i>Interior Accommodation:</i>

 The <b>interior</b> of the Rx-7, in terms of room is simply 'tiny'. The Rx-7 is a two seater with very little room up front, and the same can be said about the storage space in the rear. Stark , black plastic is the main theme in the RX-7, but the RX-7 is more about performance and driver enjoyment than luxury. The RX-7 does come with  plenty amenities, a tachometer, power sunroof, AC, power door locks and windows, Am/FM cassette player, and a front air bag. The front seats were made of quality leather, and with 90K miles on this car the leather was still in beautiful condition. The seats are somewhat supportive, but due to the tiny space, the driver gets uncomfortable very fast, especially if you are over 5'6". I would comment on the sound system, but the stock system in this car was replaced.

<b>Exterior Innovation:</b>

 The <b>exterior</b> of the '93 RX-7 was very cleverly designed. The RX-7 represents a mix of oriental and  western styling. The Japanese influence comes in the number of scoops and vents which are functional and add appeal to the overall shape of this car, the western influence comes  in the simple but curvaceous lines. This design has often been compared to the current generation Chevrolet Corvette.  

  <i>Price & reliability</i> 

The '93 RX-7 originally would set you back around $34,000 back in '93. Today a used model can be had for around $15,000; if you are lucky enough to find one for sale. Reliability has been good for the owner of this car, which was bought originally in '93, very few repairs have been needed thanks to meticulous maintenance.

<i>Conclusion:</i> 

A sure classic, that represents excellent performance in all respects, and exclusivity rights many cars could only dream of. The RX-7 is recommended for any sports car enthusiast who is looking for a unique racer.
