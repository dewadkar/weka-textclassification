            The Toyota Camry is the perfect vehicle for the average family.  The advertisements you read are all true -- great performance, durability, and not to mention price!  Driving the Camry is a blast and all my friends try to borrow it from me!  Also, unlike other vehicles, this car has plenty of room in the back.  It's a good car to take on vacations, because everyone can be comfortable (the seats are way easy to adjust).  The car could be more fast food friendly though -- cup holders in the back and change holders.  A place to put my cell phone would be terrific. My Camry is a '95 and the ONLY problem I've had is that the electric antenna motor quit.  Overall, the car is worth the money you'll spend because the cost of care is so low, and with it's sleek design and variety of colors and features everyone can find a match.  <br><br>
