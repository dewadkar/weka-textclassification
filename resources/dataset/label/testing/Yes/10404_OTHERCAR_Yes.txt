            We bought the car intending for my husband to use back in 1995.  But when my car became unable to do its job, I then had to take the Dynasty.  The first thing I loved about this car was the plush seats and nice room it had in the trunk.  The Dynasty became a great family car and now with three children it has become the greatest thing we could have invested in.  I think the only con about having this vehicle is that if the computer in the car breaks or if you have transmision problems it can end up bieng very costly.  But almost all cars can get costly when breaking. It took the car five years after buying it &quot;used&quot; to start having problems.  The car has been through many jobs including the car bieng used for the job. And has taken us to many family outings feeling comfortable.  After having 120,000 some miles it still is a very good car.This is a good family car.  <br><br>
