               My wife and I are very picky shoppers.  We research all of the major purchases, looking for the right product at the right price.
   In the HP PhotoSmart 200 Digital Camera, I believe that is what we have found!  Within 5 minutes of opening the box, we were starting to take pictures that we would soon download to our computer.
   The PhotoSmart is easy to use and set up.  Just slide the lens cover to the side and start taking pictures.  To use the screen, press the blue button in the back and click OK.  This was not the case with other products we looked at.  Some we failed to even get started.
   Although the photosmart is a 1 megapixal camera, the ease of use far outweighs any disadvantages.
   We have used the camera more in 4 months than any other camera we have owned.  It's small, lightweight and fits comfortably in the hand, unlike the akwardness of a Sony.
   We have been happy with it, hope you will be too.<br><br>
