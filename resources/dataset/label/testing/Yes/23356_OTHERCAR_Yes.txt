            OK - I confess. I have a very bad habit. Automobiles. I am an auto junky. My passion is four wheel drive vehicles. I have owned an odd assortment of them over the years, from a Nissan Patrol to a Subaru SVX. When I traded in my 1994 Isuzu Rodeo in 1997, I looked at all sorts of 4WD's. I almost purchased a Mitsubishi Montero, but casually drove over to the Mercedes dealer to check out the then-new 1998 M-Class. I had made terrible fun of these vehicles after the movie &quot;Jurassic Park The Lost World&quot; was released. Much to my surprise, I loved it! Much more to my surprise, the dealer had one scheduled for delivery that week that was unallocated! This vehicle normally had a waiting list a year long! 

Well, I purchased it. Of course, it had the normal early production problems associated with a new release. I am aware of these problems, as I frequently purchase vehicles just as they are introduced. The dealer service was wonderful. As a previous purchaser of Japanese and American vehicles, the Mercedes dealer excelled in every aspect. This more than made up for the production glitches of the M-Class. After coming to the end of the warranty this year, I decided to trade it in. The numerous and complicated computer and drive train systems that could fail made me start calculating the expense of keeping this vehicle.

But � with what should I replace this go-anywhere, do-anything vehicle? Again, I looked at all the alternatives, and concluded that the only vehicle I wanted was another M-Class! In 2000, there are several M-Class models from which to choose. V-8? V-6? Hot rod ML55? I settled on the V-6 again. The balance of power in my previous ML320 was fine for me. All three M-Class models are rated for 5,000 lb towing capacity. I upgraded in terms of options. My 1998 M-Class was the �base� model, with cloth upholstery. The new ML has leather, a sunroof, heated seats, and the Bose stereo upgrade. In addition, Mercedes has made a vast leap in quality of fit and finish in the 2000 models. The list includes:

- Gas struts instead of a prop to support the hood
- Standard switchable ESP (electronic stability control) and Brake Assist in addition to the standard Traction Control
- New door seals. Now the doors close with the Mercedes thunk!
- A modular control system that controls radio, tape, CD changer, GPS, and phone functions in the dash
- Higher quality materials on the interior, including standard burl wood dash, softer dash padding, improved door panels
- New safety features, including three shoulder harnesses for the rear seats and air bags in the rear doors (in addition to the four air bags at the front)
- Simpler operation of the rear folding seats
- Cleaner exterior appearance on the ML320, with body color bumpers and rocker moldings

The only improvement I made on the 1998 ML320 was the tires. The standard tires were street biased that provided limited use in any situation. I replaced them with BFG A/T KO tires in a larger size � 265/75-16.  An additional benefit from the tire switch, two extra inches of ground clearance, allowed the M-Class to go almost anywhere. When I traded vehicles, I transferred these tires to the 2000 ML320.
