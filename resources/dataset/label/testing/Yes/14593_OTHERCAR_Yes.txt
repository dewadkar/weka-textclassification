            We've had this car (the fully loaded EX-R) in our family for almost 10 years now.  My father bought it new, and it was our first new car.  I've had three vehicles of my own since then, but they still have this car because it will not stop running.  It is in perfect shape.  The only thing that has been needed, besides the usual maintenance, is a front axle replacement, which may have had something to do with me sliding into a curb on an icy road.

This car HAS NEVER BROKEN DOWN!  A friend of mine owns the 2 door (ours is 4), and he's having the same experience.  Our car has over 150,000 miles on it, and it feels like new.  The interior layout feels as fresh now as it did then (which is either a condemnation of carmakers, or a tribute to Honda), and is so simple to use.  The buttons are all big and smooth, plain and simple.  Nothing feels out of place.

The engine is still snappy and for overtaking on the highway, this little 4 cylinder packs a real pop.  The seats are comfortable and offer adjustable lumbar supports.  

I could go on and on about this vehicle, but their are really only three important things to say about it:  1) it's a great price on the used market and it will retain it's value very well - everyone knows these cars are indestructable  2) no one wants to pay for repairs - buy this, and you won't have to, it's that good, and 3) it has every amenity you want in a vehicle: power everything, sunroof, cupholder, lumbar supports, fold-down rear seats, valet key, tilt-in sideview mirrors, and a great stereo.  It's also phenomenal on gas.

This car also has the best eyeline I've ever experienced while driving.  It feels like you're driving a sports car, and at the price they're going for, THAT'S a real deal!
