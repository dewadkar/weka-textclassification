            I bought this car in November 1999 because my 93 Mazda MX-3 V6 was showing its age which needed a few expensive parts. I wasn't interested in a Mazda because of it's high cost of maintainance and it's poor dealer service. So, naturally the choice was to go with a Toyota or a Honda. The final decision was to go with a corolla....here are the reasons.

For all the American neibors,, it's all in canadian dollars.

1.From similar pricing point of view, The corolla has the power advantage over the civic 125 hp vs 106 for the civic.
You can feel the difference especially with the 5 sp transmission. I found out that the 1.8L engine is very similar to the new Celicas motor except for its air intake and the camshafts of the engine.

2.Toyota offers a graduate rebate program of $750 Canadian that could be used as a downpayment or into your bank account.

3.Servicing. For 100,000 km / 60000mile service, corolla does not need to replace its timing belt due to its chain design. bottom line...Corolla would cost around $250 canadian for the complete service. Honda would cost $650 because of it's timing belt replacement. Call the dealer for the price!!

4.Considering the power differences the corolla edges out the civic in fuel comsumption.

The vehicle currently has 30000 trouble free miles and I havent spent any money on it except for the oil changes.

The only complaint I have is the unsporty handling and it's tires that squells when cornered hard. The Honda civic feels and looks sportier but the corolla is more civilized.
