            In 1993 my son purchased a new Ford Ranger 2WD. (Check out his review, <a href='/auto-review-3661-1CD1A9A-3895D834-prod5'>http://www.epinions.com/auto-review-3661-1CD1A9A-3895D834-prod5</a>) Now my son is a very generous young man, and this truck has virtually become the family truck. He has loaned it to almost every member in the family, countless times. In fact, I could probably say that we and his siblings have put almost as many miles on this little truck as he has!

One year, he let my husband and I borrow it to drive to Branson Mo, because we were afraid that our old Oldsmobile would not be able to safely make the 1200 mile round trip. 

When our oldest son moved to Texas, the Ranger was used for the move. We made three trips moving his belongings to his new home. On one of them, the truck was so heavily loaded that its top speed was only 45 mph--and this driving on I-35! <i>LONG</i> trip! Again, when he moved once more to a new home, the Ranger was pressed into use.

In addition to these trips, my son has loaned his truck numerous other times to friends and family over the past seven years. The Ranger has always been reliable and equal to the task.

A few weeks ago, we had taken a trip to Dallas. On our return trip, our Grand Marquis overheated and we were stranded on the side of the road. Once again the Ranger was called to the rescue.  Hooking up his long, flat trailer to it, my son drove down to where we were and together, he and my husband were able to get our car loaded onto the trailer. The combined weight of the trailer and car made quite a heavy load for the little truck. After reaching Ok.City, we stayed there for the night, and then my husband and I drove the truck on home. It must have been quite a sight, as the trailer and car were bigger than the truck. We received a lot of stares!

Still, we made it home in good time, with no problem. My husband said that the Ranger needed a little bigger motor, as he had to drive the 4 cylinder truck in third gear a good part of the time. But, then, the truck wasn't meant to carry such a heavy load!

We have been so impressed with the way this truck has performed. It has been equal to whatever use it has been put to. Although often it has been strained to the utmost of its ability, it always comes through! It has never had a major mechanical problem, and appears to have many more years of hard use left in it. This is one tough little truck!
