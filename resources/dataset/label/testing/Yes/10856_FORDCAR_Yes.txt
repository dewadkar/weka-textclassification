            After living in IL. for 31 years we retired to SC. and decided to invest in a mini van so when people came we could all travel together. The van was a great people mover and very comfortable for all.

 It was lower to the ground and there was no need for running boards and very easy for all ages to enter and exit.  It had rear heat and air which is a must for those sitting in the last seat.  

I have only 2 complaints about this vehicle the road noise coming from the floorboard was terrible (it seems to me if you pay that much for a van they could cut down on the noise) and the fact that in high winds it seemed top heavy.

 It held to the road great. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who has to transport a large number of people of all ages consistently. The gas mileage was good also.

 It is not a vehicle for 2 people to use everyday and just put to its full capacity once or twice a year. As you have probably figured out we have since traded for an escort wagon. That however is another review.<br><br>
