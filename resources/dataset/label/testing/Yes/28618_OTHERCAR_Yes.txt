            I know very little about digital photography but I wanted a digital camera very badly so I could display my art online and update my family with new pictures every so often. So for Christmas my dad took me out to the camera store and the sales clerk said the Fuji FinePix A101 was probably the most inexpensive yet decent starter camera we could find. So we took it.
What I absolutely love about this camera is the quality of it's photos. They are crystal clear shots. I also like the fact that the camera is small so it's very portable. Plus it has neat features like being able to take 20 second video clips, as well as the automatic timer so you can take pictures of yourself. Also, it's easy to view your shots after you've taken them and it's very simple to delete the frames you don't want. Although, my favorite thing about the camera is that once you've got the software set up on your computer, when you hook the camera up to the USB cable and turn it on, your pictures automatically appear on the screen. I just find it amazing that I can take a picture and just a few minutes later I can e-mail it. 
Problems I have with this camera. First off, there is so much to read and learn about how it works. I'm the kind of person that learns by experimenting, plus I don't have time to sit there and figure out what every feature is for. There are so many options on the camera that I'm afraid to mess around with it for fear of breaking it. However, after fooling with it for a while I was able to take nice pictures within seconds. Also, setting up the software was a huge ordeal. Word of advice, make sure your USB port can be detected on your system. I had to have a computer professional come to my house and figure out why my computer wasn't accepting the software. Granted, it wasn't the software's fault, but it can cause you problems if you aren't prepared ahead of time.
Overall, I'll be the first to admit I'm not quite qualified to professionally review digital cameras. What I can say is that I'm an idiot and I've figured out how to operate this camera well enough to take great pictures of things and get them on my computer within a matter of minutes. I think it looks more complicated than it is. For under 200 dollars I would totally recommend it to those who are interested in digital photography but aren't going to put a lot of effort and time into the details of it.
