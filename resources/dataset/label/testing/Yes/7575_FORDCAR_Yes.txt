            I drive a 1998 Ford Expedition, Eddie Bauer edition.  Not being a typical Ford lover I wasn't sure if I'd like this suv or not but I absolutely love it.  My husband and I are in the used car business and I had been wanting a suburban.  We got the Expedition bought and he asked if I wanted to drive that until he could find me a suburban.  I now tell him not to be in any hurry.

This suv has everything a person could want in a truck or suv.  It has as much hauling capacity and most any truck since the 3rd seat is easily removed.  Mine has front and rear air, front and rear stereo, heated leather seats (which I dearly love), and all kinds of reading lights very strategically placed so as not to bother the driver.  It's very roomy and thus you never feel cramped up inside.  Mine is a 4 wheel drive so I really didn't think it would ride and drive all that well but boy was I wrong.  It rides and drives almost as smoothly as any car and yet has lots of power.

The only thing that I can find wrong with my expedition is that it gets terrible gas mileage.  I only get about 13 to 14 miles per gallon. <br><br>
