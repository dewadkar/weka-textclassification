            I inherited a 1989 Olds Cutlass Ciera SL from my grandmother 3 years ago.  As such, it has been fairly well maintained and has extremely low mileage (58,000).

This vehicle has the optional 3.3 liter V6 which has an excellent service record.  There are no manufacturer recalls on this model, as far as I know.

I have only had to do routine maintenance (tires, battery, exhaust) aside from one tie rod replacement, and one new alternator.

Good points:  extremely reliable, sufficient power (160 hp), roomy, large trunk, fairly inexpensive parts (repair and maintenance).  Distributor-less ignition.  Comfy seats, simple controls and layout.  Smooth ride.  Excellent snow traction (never been stuck).  No rust after 10 New England winters!

Bad points:  &quot;dummy lights&quot; instead of full instrumentation, low-quality factory radio, trunk opening does not extend down to bumper for easy loading, oil filter difficult to get at without removing right front wheel.  Dated styling of exterior/interior.  No ABS, no airbags.  Have to take it easy on off-ramps and sharp turns (does not have a tight, good-handling suspension or wide tires).  Back 3 spark plugs are a bit difficult to get at when tuning up.  

This is a great, reliable car.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a roomy family sedan, or a second car.  It is a reasonably priced vehicle which is inexpensive to repair and maintain...perfect for a child in high school or college.  It has served me well, and I would buy another without hesitation.<br><br>
