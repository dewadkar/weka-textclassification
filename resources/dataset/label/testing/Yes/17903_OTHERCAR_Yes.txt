            We purchased our Mountaineer after test driving a lot of different SUV's.  The ride in the Mountaineer was by far superior than anything else in the size.  Most of the other SUV's had a lot of road noise not the 1998 Mountaineer.  With the fold down seats it really is the best of both worlds.  Comfort combined with utility.  With the adjustable lumbar supports this vehicle is made for traveling. The built in security features are a nice touch.  We will definitely get another one when its time to trade in again!<br><br>
