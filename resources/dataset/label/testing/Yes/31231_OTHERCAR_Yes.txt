            Other reviewers have reviewed this SUV and I concur wholeheartedly. There is no doubt that the new Liberty has the Jeep quality and value you expect to receive. I previously owned a 97 Toyota Rav 4 and then a 99 Rav( which I did like)  and traded in the latter for the Jeep.  So far I'm convinced that the Liberty is a better car for the same money. The Sport model that I bought was upgraded with side curtain air bags, alloy wheels and a cd changer in the dash. I dont think that the 2001 Rav 4 even comes with  side air bags. The Liberty is larger and just seems more substantial that the Rav 4, plus it comes with 4wd on command rather than all the time like the Ra4, which makes for a better ride. Only complaint is the poor gas mileage, even worse that the Rav 4..which Jeep says is 16 city and 20 on the highway. In actuality, expect even less. But the Liberty is a 6 cylinder.  Bottom line: if you dont care about the gas  mileage, the Liberty is a better choice than the Rav 4. Compare and see for yourself.
