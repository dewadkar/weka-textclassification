            When we went to buy a car we wanted to downsize our second vehicle.  I was leary when my wife indicated that she wanted to trade in her 1994 Accord on a 2000 Civic, but since she was to be the primary driver I agreed to look.  I looked, we drove we bought that night.  The 2000 Civic is a great little car and the VP model is reasonably priced.  

What is a VP?  It is a DX / EX hybrid.  It contains the center console, power doors, CD Player, air conditioning, and keyless entry for $1000.00 less than the base LX.  You lose power windows and mirrors vs the LX but the LX does not have a CD player or keyless entry.  The VP also sports a monochromatic paint scheme with color keyed side molding.  The car is sharp.  

The engine deliver adequate power for the size of the car and although you won't be able to merge out of pit row at Indy getting on and off the expressway is fine.  

There is a slight legroom issue in the back seat if the front is all the way back and at 6' 2&quot; mine is.  

Car seats fit fine in the center and the car is equipped with three tether points to meet the new safety standards.

This car is a little sipper making it great on the gas budget.

Dash board is well laid out and easy to access.

This is not a luxury car but handles bumps and cornering well even if the horn does go meep meep.<br><br>
