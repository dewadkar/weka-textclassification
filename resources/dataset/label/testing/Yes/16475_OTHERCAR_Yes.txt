            I bought the Dodge 2001 Grand Caravan ES new in October of 2000. It was built in Windsor Ontario, Canada and had all of the specifications and features that I wanted, including the Silver paint. I had studied the web site and gained familiarity with the various options and packages.

All of the systems and features worked upon delivery. I was very impressed with the workmanship and the engineering. The large wheels and 4 wheel disc ABS brakes and the suspension package work extremely well in providing safe and accurate handling and ride. The engine power and drivetrain are very good and smooth. The system is setup for 87 octane gasoline and the performance is excellent.

I like the powered doors on both sides and the powered big door on the back. I was concerned about the long term reliability of these doors, but I found them to be well designed and very strong. Time will time if they will be operational in 8-10 more years.

The interior is really nice. It is the quietest vehicle I have owned (16 other of various types).

The sound system and speakers sound better that the stereo in my house. As you can tell I really like my van.

I currently (March 2002) have 20K miles and have had no problems at all. I have taken it to the dealer where I bought it for the standard service as listed in the owners manual. This has all gone fine.

If this level of operation and performance continues for another 100,000 miles, it will be the best vehicle that I have ever owned, with the exception of a 1979 924 Porsche that still is going and looks great too.
