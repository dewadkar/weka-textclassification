For those of you like me (the average digital camera shopper), we don't necessarily know what we are looking for in a camera.  When I began looking for one, I made a list of the uses I wanted the camera for, and also the features I wanted.  

Beginning with the uses, I realized that I wanted a digital camera with a good enough resolution that I could print 35mm photo quality pictures.  So, this immediately limited me to 2.1 megapixels and up.  So, determine what use your camera will be for.  If it's for internet photos, you do not need anything expensive or special.  
Next, I asked myself, &quot;what features do I want in a digital camera?&quot;  This question is a little more difficult, because there are so many choices, and no one camera includes them all.  My priority in selecting a camera was it's size.  The Canon Powershot s10 is one of the smallest 2.1 megapixel digital cameras ever made (rivaled only by the Canon Digital Elph).  I've noticed that a large, bulky camera usually goes unused.  It's too much of a hassle to carry around a big case, accessories, etc.  The s10 includes everything you need in a VERY compact form.  Also, I wanted a lot of little extra features.  It has a 10 second delay (and it lets you know when the picture will be taken), so everyone can be included in your photos.  You can also take panoramic photos, which is a really nice feature for landscapes and other large scenes.  The memory upgrade capabilities are top of the line.  It can support the IBM microdrive 340 MB, which would allow you to take hundreds or thousands of pictures, depending on the quality you select.  I also wanted some manual control, but a lot of automatic control as well, so I wouldn't always be bothered with those things.  This camera gives a nice balance between the two.  

The price was within my range.  If you shop online (I recommend www.computershopper.com), you can probably get the camera for a little over $300, and the battery and recharger for another $70).  When I bought it, I paid about $500 total, but it was well worth it.  Definitely one of the best investments I've made.  The pictures always come out looking great, and if you're not happy with a shot, you can simply delete it off the memory card before uploading it to the computer.  Again, as I've mentioned in the beginning, no one camera is ideal for everyone.  Make a list of your wants, and then do a little research on the camera.  (check out www.imaging-resource.com   - it's helpful in comparing actual images between cameras, so you can actually see the difference between 1.4 megapixels, 2.1, and 3.4).  So, I would strongly recommend this camera, but again, only if these features are what you were looking for.  Goodluck with buying your digital camera!!<br><br>
