            I have always loved Porsches ever since I was a little kid.  I had models, posters, Matchbox cars, and even Micro Machines (remember those?) of different model Porsches.  But my favorite has always by far been the 911.  Why?  I am not sure, but there is just something about the way the front end looks that intrigues me.

Well, a couple years ago I bought a Miata (another of my favorite kinds of cars) and that was my baby.  It was Cherry Red, and I put a lot of time and work into it to make it look perfect.  I bought every after market performance part I could find for it - leather seats, low-profile headlights (those were especially cool), cold air intake turn signals, a spoiler, taillight covers, a carbon fiber dash kit, red gauges (which looked really sweet when you looked in at the speedometer), the chrome style bar, 16&quot; chrome wheels, a sweet stereo system...and this isn't even mentioning all the engine work i did to get extra horsepower and handling.  Al in all I spent $7K for the car and around another $9k on all the extras.

Well, when I had everything I could possibly find to do to my car, and it was just how I liked it, I got bored.  I had nothing to work on.  I have a motorcycle also, but there isn't that much you can do to a bike, and it didn't take long to trick it out with all the extras.

So when a guy at work told me one day that he was selling his 93 Porsche 911, I was naturally intrigued.  He wanted more for it than I could afford, but after talking to him, I got him to go look at my car, and he traded me his car for mine, and then I threw him a couple grand extra for the trade.  Now I have the car of my dreams, and it is entirely stock so there is more work to do.

One complaint I have always heard people make about the Porsche 911 is that the clutch peddle is too close to the brake, making it hard to shift.  For this reason, I have heard people refer to it as a girl's car (I guess women can drive smaller cars, or something....never have figured that one out).   Well, I am 5'8&quot; and weigh about 155-160 (depending on if I actually feel like working out or not) and I have absolutely no trouble changing gears or driving the car.  I think it is set up just about perfect as far as that goes.

You have to keep in mind that this is a true sports car, and not a luxury car, so it is going to ride a little rougher than most cars you are used to driving.  This is due to how close to the road you are as well as the way the suspension is set to hug the corners at high speeds.  This is only natural, and you will notice this with any sports car.

Speaking of hugging corners, that is exactly what this car does.  I can take corners at speeds that would turn most normal people's hair grey or make it fall out.  Maybe that is one reason (between the car and my super sport bike) that I keep my head shaved - I am afraid to see how much of my hair I have lost due to these vehicles!

The acceleration is excellent.  My bike will still blow the doors off of it, but I would compare this car stock to my Miata after all the engine work I did (including the turbo kit, the racing chip, and the exhaust system).  I must say that it is close to the fastest car I have ever driven, and I am loving that.

Naturally, I had to buy a convertible, living in Florida and all, but I have seen the hard top version and it isn't too shabby, either.

The only negative thing about this car (and I hate to say it) is that it is a 2 seater, like my Miata.  That would be great if I was still single, or even just married without any kids, but my wife gives me a hard time almost every single day about buying another 2 seater convertible when I am supposed to be growing up and being responsible.  But that is why we have HER minivan (not mine, but definitely HERS!)

Umm...just don't tell her I mentioned that, ok?  hehehe<br><br>
