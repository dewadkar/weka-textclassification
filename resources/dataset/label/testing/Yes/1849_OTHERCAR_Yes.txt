            My fiancee owns a 4 door 97 Grand Am SE V6 and has put almost 40K miles on it in two and a half years (she has a long commute). She loves it. Having sold cars for a while, I am less impressed with some of it. The gas mileage on highway drives (including a lot of blocked traffic driving) is surprisingly good for such an old-fashioned and relatively large engine (3.1L V6). The Pontiac's performance is also astounding considering that it is a family sedan with a lot of body cladding. I am very fond of the roominess of the car; it beats some of the Japanese competitors like a Corolla or Altima of the same years. We're extremely happy to have the fold-down rear seats - even though we've only used them twice or so they saved us from renting a van or truck when buying furniture.

This car has had only minor maintenance issues - the battery died early on in its life and there were electric gremlins also pointed out by other reviews such as the check engine light. The feature content of this car is very good indeed, I'm happy that my fiancee has traction control which helps considerably on a rainy day. Everything you need is included except for a rear seat armrest, a CD player, and a switch for the dome light (it's automated). I believe that GM and other US-made cars can be very hit-and-miss in quality - they may be clunkers or last forever. Look around you and you see that there are tons of old American cars on the road still, holding up with multiple hundred K miles on it. 

I'm unhappy with the comfort of the seats, they are too cheaply made and mushy for my taste. On the passenger front seat, the catalytic converter bump intrudes slightly into the legroom and forces tall people to assume uncomfortable seating positions.

Unfortunately, the GrandAm doesn't have a particularly good image - it's an average US family sedan with pseudo-sporty body cladding and a subpar reliability record. Depreciation is therefore, in my opinion, extremely high. A major problem when trading my fiancees car in, particularly considering that it looks and drives like new.
