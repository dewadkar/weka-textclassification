            When I got a divorce I had No car so my ex-son-n-law got me a Oldsmobile Cutlass. My drivers side the door had to be wired shut because it was falling off.  He put a brand new water pump and new battery. It was the best car I ever owed. The engine I would have trusted to take anywhere. I took it to Oregon one year in the snow and it went through all kinds of weather perfectly. The only thing that was bad with that model in 1979 was the outside of the car was falling apart the floors we're falling out!  the outside bumpers we're all falling apart but the engine was so trusted it had the best engine anyone could have expected. It was a 452 and it did get up and go.  I would have taken it anywhere!!!!!!<br><br>
