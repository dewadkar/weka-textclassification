            First off I started 4 years ago driving suv's.  It was a chevy blazer.  I loved it, and vowed that I would never go back to driving a car again. Since then after 3 years I wanted something brand new and decided to buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, which I also liked.  Still would never go back to a car, but one fall back was it drove too much like a truck, better then a blazer but still not great.  My sister owned a Ford explorer and took hers on a test drive which was a 1999.  It drove great.  I decided 2 months ago to go to a Ford dealer, where my Dad worked for 25 years and has since retired.  He swore by Fords, but I figured well they are probably just as good as any other, but I was wrong. I got into a 2001 Ford Explorer sport and drove it right home.  It was beautiful looking and the ride was tremendous.  Even the interior was made so great.  Smoothest ride I ever drove and the best SUV I have ever owned, drove, or driven in.  A great comfortable ride, and great for the kids.  The options are tremendous also.  Definitely better for kids than a mini van also.  Warning...once you drive one.....you will be driving it right to your doorstep.  Bravo to Ford!!!!!<br><br>
