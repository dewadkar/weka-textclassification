            For the vast majority of buyers, even those of us out west - where the mountains have snow on them year round, and some roads have never been paved - SUV's are pretty much a waste of 4-wheel drive capacity. The average 4-wheel drive SUV owner users his/her all-wheel drive about once or twice per year, generally under circumstances in which it isn't really necessary. That said, if you want an SUV, you'll buy one anyway.

If you really want SUV performance at a reasonable entry price and with very good reliability - go for the Nissan Pathfinder. You'll get into it for less than most competitors, and you'll be happy with its off-road manners. The fuel consumtion - with the V-6 engine is mediocre (we get about 16-20 MPG) for a &quot;small&quot; vehicle, but it's peppy and gets one up to highway speed quickly. Once above the basic stripped down model, the interior is quite comfortable.

The down side stuff: In my opinion, some of the interior amenities of our '97 are mediocre. The cup holders (molded into the console) are hard to reach and don't hold all cup sizes; the one for the back seat are almost impossible to pull out. While the rear removeable cargo cover is useful in hiding stored goodies, it restricts the amount of rear storage space, and is difficult to stow in the car when it's removed (leave it in the garage if you'll be hauling lots of stuff.) The cruise control system requires the drive to first press a difficult-to-see switch on the dash, then activate a second button on the steering wheel. All pretty minor stuff, actually.

We've owned an earlier model of both the Jeep Cherokee and Toyota's 4 Runner and find the Pathfinder equally comfortable, functional and reliable to the Toyota and head and shoulders above the Jeep...but at a lower price. The Nissan doesn't have the prestige of the Toyota or Jeep, but we don't buy for that reason.

If I could own whatever I wanted, I'd have one of the monsters again (as we did while our kids were growing up.) You can put the whole neighborhood and most of their belongings in it, but it's way more rig than Momma wants to wield on a daily basis, and I don't own an oil company.

We like our Pathfinder, would definitely recommend it, and we'd buy another one.<br><br>
