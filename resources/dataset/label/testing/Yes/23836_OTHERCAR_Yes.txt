            I recently got my learners license and starting driving many differnt type of cars. I have found that my favourite is the Toyota Echo. It is a unique shape that appeals to the &quot;cool&quot; part of my teenage mind, yet at the same time is very efficent. While gas prices are going up around North America, the echo is still very affordible to fill and you get very good milage with each tank of gas. The interiour is very comforable for four adults and it comes with a awesome radio and sound system. It drives very smoothly. The only weird thing about the car is the location of the spedometior. It is located in the middle of the top of the dashboard. I find this is a good thing, esspecially for someone who is learning how to drive. For most people looking down at the dash is okay. But for a learner, they tend to stare at it and / or turn the wheel so that they could become in a potetionally dangerous position. Yet having it in the middle and up high makes it easier to know what speed you are going. <br><br>
