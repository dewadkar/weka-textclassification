            <b>FIRST IMPRESSION:</b>

My wife and I reserved a full-size car at Dollar Rent A Car for a road trip to meet her parents in Las Vegas.  Keep in mind that we're driving from Portland, Oregon (the most boring ride down I-5 South)...  When we got there, we were given a 1999 Subaru Outback Wagon.  I was worried that we'd be paying tons of money for gas, but I didn't complain because the vehicle had merely a little over 2,000 miles on it.  From the looks of the car, it had soft curves, good-size tires, and it sat pretty high off the ground for a station wagon.  It was equipped with big, round fog lights that gave the car a rally-style look.  The dual-paint job made the Outback stand out in the terrain.  It drove fairly well, too.  I was thinking...&quot;I can get used to this...&quot;

<b>FIRST 3 HOURS:</b>

We packed the Outback with a few backpacks, cooler of food, and some boxes of gifts for my wife's parents.  We managed to fit most of the things in the back and we put the retractable cover over it.  Nice.  I noticed that there were no door frames protecting the windows.  Is there a purpose for this (maybe to prevent hands being jammed or was it a weight factor?).  We left our house at 2:30 in the morning.  I was suited up and ready to go.  I adjusted the seats just right and I dropped the steering column enough to where I could steer the car with my left hand on the wheel and my elbow on the door frame.  I noticed that the ride was very, very quiet.  I could hardly notice the road noise.  The ride was very smooth, as well.  


<b>NEXT 10 HOURS:</b>

It wasn't long until I had to fill up with gas.  I had a 1/4 of a tank left and didn't want to run out on the highway.  I think I calculated about 24 MPG on the first fill-up.  Another thing I noticed was that the stereo wasn't that great.  The digital readout was kind of hard to read during the day, as well.  I finally found the <i>Achilles tendon</i> of the Outback... as I was traveling about 75 MPH and slowly climbing the mountainsides of northern California, the Outback started to scream with pain.  It went from 75 MPH to 70, then to 65, then down to about 55 MPH...  I actually had to take down to 3rd gear.  I was afraid that the car was going to overheat.  A VW Jetta passed me with ease, followed by a Ford Taurus, a Jeep Cherokee, and a Freightliner truck...all in that order.  


<b>WE MADE IT:</b>

It was a very long trip, and we finally made it to Vegas.  I'd say that the ride was very comfortable.  It even rained on the last 3 hours of the trip and the Outback handled very well in wet pavement at high and low speeds.  The rear seating is fairly cramped for long trips, but for short city commuting, it's okay.  As we reached Vegas, the AC worked well and we enjoyed driving around in the Outback.  


<b>ON THE WAY HOME:</b>

We had a lot of stuff to bring back to Oregon.  We barely managed to bring everything back.  There wasn't as much space as we thought there would be even with the seats folded down.  Also, it was pretty irritating to know that we had to fill up the tank every 340 miles or so.  I remember my VW Fox with a tiny gas tank getting 400 miles before it begged for gas.  But then again, I had to keep on reminding myself that the Outback was all-wheel-drive.  The ride back home was okay.  We were mentally and physically tired, so all we wanted to do was get back ASAP.  The Subaru Outback did just that.  It got us back home in one piece.  


<b>SUMMARY:</b>

The <b>1999 Subaru Legacy Outback</b> is made for the city and for gravel roads.  It's not an offroad performer as they portray in the commercials.  The 4-cylinder engine doesn't quite produce enough power to make it up steep hills and the interior space is about the same size as any other station wagon in its class size.  I have to admit, the Outback is very quiet on the highway and even in the city.  The ride is very smooth and the engine isn't very loud until you punch it to go up hills. It handles a little sluggishly, but it's nothing to complain about knowing that it's a sport-ute.  For the price, it's an added bonus to get AWD.  Especially in Oregon where wet roads are a common site, you may want to consider an AWD such as this or if you're interested, you may even want to try the Outback SUS (Sport Utility Sedan).  All in all, for the price of an Outback wagon, you get a pretty good package.                 <br><br>
