            As an owner of this car I have researched and compared this vehicle to its competitors.  The car obviously came out at the top (since I did buy it). The TL has more horsepower than its competitors such as the BMW 3 series or the Lexus ES300.  The handling and acceleration of the vehicle is remarkable.  The styling is very sporty and also luxurious.  A floor of the gas engages an engine which sounds better than a car stereo.  Also, the car comes loaded with standard features which any luxury sedan should.  If you are looking for cars in this price range I without a doubt recommend this vehicle.  <br><br>
