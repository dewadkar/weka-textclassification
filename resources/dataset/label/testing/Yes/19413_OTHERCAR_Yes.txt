            Compared to other mini SUVs, such as Suzuki's Grand Vitara, Toyota's RAV4, and Kia's Sportage, none could beat Honda's CRV. These are mini because they're smaller than conventional SUVs like the Pathfinder or 4Runner, etc. It has responsive handling because it's based on the Civic's platform. It gives great gas mileage for an SUV, 20-22 city and almost 25 highway. For a tad over $20K (I bought mine for $21,900 out the door), you get the top EX model. Features include 15&quot; alloy wheels, automatic with overdrive, power everything, full time all wheel drive and ABS brakes. It has the highest hp output of all the 4 cylinder engines of the competition. The Grand Vitara offers a V6 but it only has 160hps. The CRV is also the roomiest with the most cargo space of the bunch. And when you fold the back seats down, it becomes level with the cargo making it almost twice the size. I'm sure most of you already know about the picnic table under the cargo covers. There are also many small compartments to store stuff into. The seats are comfortable and upright. It could easily fit 3 adults in the back. Just go look for yourself and take a test ride. You'll leave the competition behind. <br><br>
