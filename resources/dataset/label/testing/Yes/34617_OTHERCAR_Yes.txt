            After spending a lot of time researching all kinds of sedans in the same price range, I have purchased a 1999 Subaru Legacy 2.5 GT. I found the combination of AWD, slick 5-speed transmission, and attractive styling irresistible, and the relatively high resale value was also a strong decision-making factor. I have enjoyed the car so far (approximately 30,000 miles is already on it). The handling is excellent, and inspires confidence. The shifter is light and friendly. The acceleration is more than adequate, and the brakes solid. The AWD system is great in the snow and rain. Finally, friends always comment on how handsome and comfortable the car is. 

However, I do have to voice a few complaints. First, the reverse gear is quite noisy, and is prone to &quot;popping out&quot; too early. The Subaru mechanic drove the car and suggested that there was no problems, but I can't shake the feeling that there is something wrong with the reverse. Second, the passenger side window harness is starting to split in the spot where the window is all the way up. The dealer is ordering the part, but it looks like I will have this problem again - it is not a very sturdy component. Third, the fuel economy is surprisingly average. I have to short-shift all the time to get a 375 mile range for one tank of fuel. With the recent hike in gas prices, this has been an annoyance. 

Overall, despite the minor irritants, I am extremely happy with my decision. This is the kind of car that really grows on you and becomes a part of the family. I spend a lot of time in my car, and I can say with great certainty that it is dependable, safe, and a lot of fun to drive. I would highly recommend it to anyone.   <br><br>
