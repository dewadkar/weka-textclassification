            I got this car because it was functional for me and extremely good with gas.  It is great to drive and great on gas.  My friends all LOVE my car.  I wouldn't recommend this car to someone who wants to travel around with a lot of people.  I can only really fit 2 people in it comfortable.  The back seat is really small and not very comfortable....but over all it is a really good car.  I have had it for 4 years and never had a problem with it.  The only thing about MY car is that it has no air conditioning and it's a big problem in the summer.  but that was my fault.  My car has also been broken into a couple of times...that's because they are the easiest cars to steal...it only takes a butter knife to break the lock.  But over all it is an excellent car.<br><br>
