            This is my husband's truck actually.  I thought it was so cute, I took over it when we started dating.  

This truck is so dependable...it blows my mind.  The main problem we've had with it is getting a new starter.  We also had to have the brakes replaced a few years ago and they're about to go out again.  And here lately, the engine has been making a high pitched noise that I think is an indicator of a new belt needed.

Pretty good on gas mileage.  If you want the ever popular teal color for the truck, you have a purple strip on the side of it, which we got changed for a gray one.  Nice looking truck though.  Plenty of head room for my 6'1" husband.

The driver and passenger seats have the built in lumbar system that makes almost any length of trip nice.  The back seats are the basic fold-down seats.  Not comfortable for overweight passengers or people who have motion sickness.

Unfortunately, the re-sale value of this truck is little to nothing so it really helps that this truck is so dependable that once it's paid off, you can keep it as a work/recreation vehicle and have no worries about problems developing.
