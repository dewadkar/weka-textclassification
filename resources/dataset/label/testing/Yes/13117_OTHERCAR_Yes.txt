            I purchased the 1999 Chevy Lumine in May of 1999. It was pretty much the only car I could fit in in it's price range($18,000-$22,000), and I didn't want to spend more that $22,000 for a car. Plus, I didn't want a Truck/SUV.

So, I went to test drive the Lumina. I went with Chevorlet because My 1988 Chevy Cleberity was a really good car that I had no problems with up until it hit 1000,000 miles. And, I like Americqn cars.

I noticed right away that  the Lumina had a lot of room. I stand 6' 9" tall and my head didn't touch the roof. And, I had a lot of leg room. I don't even have to roll the seat all the way back to fell comfortable when I drive. I suggest that if you are tall, go with the power seat. The power seats gives you more room and you can lower/raise the seat. With the regular seat you seem to have less leg room and head room.
