            This is a car we did ont need - but enjoy vey much.  The Jettz GLX 5-speed which was replaced satisfied our needs - The BMW offers far more stability, handling, and added width for 4 people with no performance hinderance.  Sport seats are great.  

It is the only really compact premium sedan left since its competitior have all added weight and size.  For four people or 2 adults plus luggage the BMW 3 series is perfectly sized for us - a big selling point for urban areas where parking is tight.

We would not have considered the BMW without the all wheel drive in the northeast. The added stability and handling on dry roads is an unanticipated bonus.  

Leather, sunroof, and fold down rear seats are not optional in my mind for a small premium sport sedan.  My dealer was great at locating a 330xi to meet our specs - even though it took a couple weeks before he had a 330 and 325 manual transmission car to compare. 

Make sure you drive the 330 vs. the 325 before buying.  Lease prices are so similar (within $25-$35/month) so I do not understand 325 leasees.  If you want the performance without racing the engine above 4000rpm routinely the 330 is the only choice - despite the over the top premium for the power.  For me the 325 was too similar to my Jetta VR6 to command the BMW price premium.
