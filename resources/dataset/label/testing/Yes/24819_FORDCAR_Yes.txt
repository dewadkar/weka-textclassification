            Wow a luxury sports car for under 25,000? This car is amazing, speed, power, looks, freshness, and it's totally hip man!!! I'm on the run, and this car is phat, especially in a big time car city like L.A. I spent 24,800 on my car, and it was well worth it. I get about 18 miles to the gallon on it, but the 6 cd changer makes up for that. The car doesn't handle too well in the snow, but it is especially fast on the highway (hope you're not a cop.) Teens will love this car, Adults, Geezers, and whoever the hell wants a real, mean, driving machiene. IF you really want a great american made sports vehicle for an AMAZING price, the mustangs the animal for you.<br><br>
