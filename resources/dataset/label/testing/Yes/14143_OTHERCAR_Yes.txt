            A few months before Christmas I scoured the stores for the perfect inexpensive digital camera.  I looked at over a dozen cameras in the $150-250 price range.  Most of these could not hold many pictures and were large and bulky.  

This camera comes with all the software and cords you will need to hook it up to your computer, and also edit your photos.  It also comes with batteries and a 8MB memory card.  This card can hold about 12 pictures on the highest quality setting and up to 47 on the lowest quality setting.  You can hook the camera up to your computer and transfer images and then delete them from the camera.  This allows you to out and take more pics.

The pictures come out crisp and clear.  You can print out high quality pictures up to the size 5x7.  If you make them larger than that you lose some of the quality, however they are still crisp and clear.  

The 1.6 inch LCD screen allows you to preview and review each shot before and after you take.  If you dont like it simply delete it with a few hits of the button.  The LCD screen is also great for seeing what your picture will look like before you take it.  If there is not much natural light around you can use the conventional view finder on the camera, however this does not give an accurate representation of what the picture will look like.  

Overall this camera was a great deal.  I also purchased a 32 MB memory card so I can shoot more images if I go off to vacation and can't put the pictures on my computer before I want to take more.  Other cameras in this price range come with 2-4MB cards.  If you don't want to spend too much and you want a decent camera, then the Fuji Fine Pix 1300 is the way to go!
