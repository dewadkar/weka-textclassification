            With the 2001 Civic, honda has stretched the car a little bit more to make it more comfortable inside. If you ask me I would say they succeded. The new car is better in almost every respect, and when you consider the car it replaced was alredy pretty good, it jus goes to show that this car is nearing perfction for a economy car. Getting into the rear seat is still kinda difficult for anyone over six feet tall, but it is better than before. The ride of the car is more refined and the new look matches the upscale theme. It rides smoothly, and both automatic transmission and manual are great gearboxes. Both are very well matched to the engine. Although this car moves alond pretty well, I would still like to see honda do something to help out the low end torque. The price of this car is an amazing deal. Starting around $14,000, and going almost all the way to $20,000. The ladder version of the car has all the optios you could ever want in an economy car. Overall, I would recomend this car to anyone who needs a reliable car, that won't break the bank. The Honda Civic is a great car, and honda has made it better!
