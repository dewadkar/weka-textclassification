            I recently picked myself up the 2002 S10 Crew Cab. Originally I was looking at Blazers and Jimmy's because I wanted something with more power and reliability the the Windstar (95 yuck) I had.

After looking all over and talking with dozens of Car salesman, the great folks up at Key Chev Olds in Yorkton suggested that I look at the S10 Crew Cab instead.

1) Has the Same seating capacity as a Blazer and Jimmy (Almost identical inside the cab, with about the same dimensions etc.)

2) Has a 4.6 foot truck bed with standard cargo liner for storage. about 2 feet more than a Jimmy or Blazer. I opted to add a custom fit topper so it has even more "sheltered,  lockable" storage.

Now I have a considerable amount more cargo room than a Blazer or Jimmy, might even be more that the van when the third seat was removed.....

3) Same engine, powertrain and towing capacity as Jimmy and Blazer!

I can say enough about this package it is awesome! The only downside will be that in the winter the truck bed is not heated so anything that we don't want in the cold would have to come inside the cab, this is the one and only advantage of the Jimmy and Blazer (That I can think of), but most car trunck don't stay that warm either.....)

Another big plus was that the price of the way I rigged up the truck was considerably less than the Jimmys and Blazers.

Drives very nice (You still know your in a truck, but I was surprised at how well it handles). 

the bottom line is, that if your thinking of going the SUV route I would highly suggest you take a look at something like this, I'm sure glad I did, and I'm not alone. Three out of the 5 people I know that had Blazers and Jimmies, have since moved to this option, I wish I got commission!

I also got a great deal on the truck with the topper, command start and complete towing package! @ 34,000 Canadian, which is about $19,400-$20,500 US.
