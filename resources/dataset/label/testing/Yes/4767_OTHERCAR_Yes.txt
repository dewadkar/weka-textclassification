                 The A4 is a great car for a number of reasons.  It's fun to drive, comfortable (for the front passengers, I'm 6'3 and take up a large portion of the back seat, but I can say I'm more comfortable than in most other cars), and safe (for the most part).  By for the most part I mean I keep getting these annoying recall notices in the mail.  That however isn't even the annoying part.  The first time I received one of these letters it was a minor problem and the dealer took care of it quickly.  Now I have two more notices and to my dismay the dealer hasn't had the parts to fix them since I got the recalls about four months ago.  
    Now I don't know a lot about recalls but in my opinion these problems should be fixed, especially if they are putting me in serious danger, right?  Due to one of the problems I could lose my steering, which I consider to be fairly major.  Due to the other I could lose my brakes at -4 degrees or below.  I drive in the mountains a lot where it does get that cold, and I DO want to have control of my brakes but what am I supposed to do?  According to AUDI's 800 number I'm supposed to not go up to the mountains if it is going to be that cold.  And when are the parts going to be available? They don't know.  It's nice to pay 30 grand for a car and not be able to drive it.
  So to keep a long story from getting longer, I'd just like to say that I really like the A4.  I just hope it doesn't kill me before my dealer can get the parts to fix it.
