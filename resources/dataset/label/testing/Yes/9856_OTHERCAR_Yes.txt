            Where can I begin. First off I would have to thank Chevy for making such a good baseline Camaro. There are a lot of people that think that Camaro's are just a waste of money. I think if you love an American made car that is fun to drive as well as fun to work on then the Camaro is the car for you. I am a novice mechanic when it comes to cars but this is a easy car to do upgrades to. The high maintenance part that hear about for this particular car is not mechanical error. If you were to ride with these complaintants and see how they drive them you would see why they are high maintance. THIS IS NOT AN INDY CAR!!! If you drive it like you stoll it, then yeah, it will break. If you play around in it every once in a while it will handle the stress fine. I put my car through it's paces at least once a week, and at over 150,000 mile and counting, this Camaro works beautifully. 

Granted, there are always down sides to every good thing in life. Chevy should have never invented the unibody. Body flex leads to a lot of problems down the line. Sure there are ways to fix the problems, but price is always a consideration. Don't get me wrong, I love my Camaro, however, you do have to be either a little mechanically inclined or have the money to drive it hard. At any rate the Camaro, next to the Vette, is one of America's greatest cars.
