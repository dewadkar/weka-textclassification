            Owning the M-Class has been a bit of a love-hate relationship. It is the third Mercedes I've owned - that's the love. It's also been a difficult vehicle to own - the hate.

This is a vehicle that makes it too easy to cruise at 85-95 MPH. And you know that 100-120 is simply a slightly greater push of the throttle. But what's really amazing is you'll get 19-20 MPG at this velocity. How many 5000+ pound vehicles do you know that can say the same? My wife, who spends the greatest time in the truck, loves the M-Class. It's a strong and sturdy vehicle that provides a very comfortable ride. It's also an honest off-roader complete with a low range, although few people will ever venture into the woods, (it would be interesting to see how a M-Class handles the Rubicon).

We have one of the 1998 ML 320's, and perhaps this adds to the hate part of the equation - shaking out manufacturing issues during the first year of build. I tend to be one that connects closely to the vehicles I drive. When doing so, squeaks and rattles become distractions that take away from the joy one should be able to enjoy as they drive. Such is the case in our M-Class. I've had the dealership work on annoying squeaks from the dash and rattles from the back seat and cargo area. I'd like to say that over time, they have been fixed, however, as we near the end of the 50,000 mile warranty, these problems persist.

Of course, this is all paradoxical, in that I dearly love driving Mercedes products. Foundationally, the M-Class is built to last hundreds of thousands of miles. The handling is rock solid and the engine can run all day flat out. These are vehicles that beg you to take them above100 MPH and reward you with such control that you have to rely up the speedometer to tell you that you're really moving at a velocity of more than 146 feet per second. All of this wrapped in a leather clad, walnut wrapped interior that bathes your senses in music that can only come from a matched Bose sound system. 

Recently, I drove a 2000 ML 430. The power was more seamless, the ride quality even better and it was absent the squeaks and rattles that so mare my 320. In fact, I was so impressed by the improvements that I went ahead and ordered it. 

Does the M-Class have flaws, yes, and some are downright irritating. But its soul is pure Mercedes and it too will last at least 400,000 to 600,000 miles. I freely admit that I take driving seriously, and because I do, I tend to be more critical than most when I drive. Despite all of this, this is a vehicle I would recommend and would obviously buy.<br><br>
