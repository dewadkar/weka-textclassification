            I have a 1994 integra coupe that i bought new.  I was just out of vet school, no money, lots of loans.  I needed wheels, and had champagne taste.  I had  had only used cars, and had paid a lot in repair bills, so o was buying for reliability and warranty.  All the cheap practical cars (escort, neon etc) really offended my tastebud.  I looked at an acura, thinking there was no way i could afford it.  But it had a 4yr 50,000 mile warranty, was sporty, red, and best of all, a honda product. 80,000 with nary a blip. i love my car.<br><br>
