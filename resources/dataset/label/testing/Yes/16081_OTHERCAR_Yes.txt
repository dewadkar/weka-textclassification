            I used to have a five mile drive to work.  No traffic.  Very little rain or snow, and lots of long, straight, barely traveled desert pavement to roam.  the car I owned, a Mitsubishi Eclipse GSX (AWD, Turbo, manual trans) was a very good match for the driving I did.  Then I moved to Salt Lake City.

Traffic, freeway construction, snow, wet, and a 25 mile commute.  Time to look at a different vehicle.  I knew I wanted an automatic trans, a higher driving position, and AWD or full-time 4WD, and I wanted a $40k upper limit on my spending.

I did my research, narrowing down the candidates to the Lexus RX-300, Land Rover Discovery, and the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The Discovery was dropped from the list due to it's poor (even for a SUV!) mileage, the Lexus was dropped (as well as a few SUV's I considered earlier in the selection process) because it is based on another vehicle's frame - I wanted an SUV built to be an SUV - not based on a pickup truck, or in the RX-300's case, a Toyota Camry.

So that pretty much left the Grand Cherokee.  I bought the 2000 Grand Cherokee Limited, with all the factory options (V8, QuadraDrive, up country suspension, 10 Cd changer, tow package, heated mirrors and seats, and a sunroof) - sticker price $38,500.  I purchased it for $34,800 - well below what I was willing to spend for a vehicle in it's class.

The ride is very non-truck - nearly what I would expect from a sedan.  The interior is luxurious, well thought out(love the stereo controls on the back of the steering wheel - very easy to use!), and full of amenities.  It's everything I could ask for.

The V8 provides a surprisingly quick response, and shifts very smooth.  Anyone who has done any research on the 99/00 Grand Cherokee are probably aware of the infamous 70 mph whine, and mine has it too.  However, it's not nearly as loud as I was expecting, and is easily masked by the superb stereo. If it gets no worse, I can live with it. 

It's definitely a fast, smooth ride. Luxurious. Lot's of &quot;passing power&quot;.  All this, and I can go off-pavement on any of Utah's famed Jeep trails and do pretty darn well with completely stock equipment.  Exactly what I was looking for, and worth a look by anyone with similar requirements. <br><br>
