            I have driven my 93 Nissan Altima for a little over two years, and it has been the most reliable car for me.  I have only had to bring it to the shop once in the span of two years, and that problem was easily fixed.  
I recommend this car for any age group because of it's sportiness and it's reliability.  Even for long road trips with 5 people in the car it is a comfortable ride.  The only thing I don't like about the Altima is the motorized antenna.  It gets stuck and makes an irritating sound for about 20 seconds when you start the car.  Overall I believe this car is an incredible value.<br><br>
