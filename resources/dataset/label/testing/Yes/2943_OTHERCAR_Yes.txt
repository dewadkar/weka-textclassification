            This car is fun!  To have has much fun as driving this car you have to go back to the days where a normal day included putting a brown paper bag on fire infront your neighbor's door, stealing candies from the grocery store and eating ice cream until you pass out.

This car is a lot of fun.  Why? The integra GS has a 1.8l 4 cylinder engine that develops a very usable 140hp.  THis engine can get you from 0-60 in about 8.0 seconds with manual transmission.  (get the manual.  It's the only way to make this car fast) Top speed is around 125 mph.

These numbers aren't exceptional but it's the ease at which you can go fast with this car.  At high speed it hugs the road as well as I would hug Jennifer Lopez if she were infront of me.
On a long downhill road I was many times able to bring the car to 140mph.  And never felt insecure about its stability.

And this engine is strong.  It's like a WWF wrestler.  It can be beaten up all day and never seem to be hurt.

In traffic the car is nimble.  Steering is responsive and quick, braking although not exceptional is also very predictable, and the transmission, wow... so perfect you'll even shift for fun at red lights. 
this car is just so easy to drive.  

This car is fun!  Also because of its looks.  Especially with the GS that comes with very nice 15in wheels and spoiler.  This car has become a classic and everybody loves it.  As much people find this car beautiful as people think The Pontiac Aztek is ugly.  

Being from Canada I can also tell you that you this car's great in winter.  At least for a sport car.  It's high enough so you don't get stuck in the snow like I experienced with A saturn Sc2.  And the rear wiper is very useful for those lazy like me who don't really want to bother taking the snow off the car.  You just get in, put all the wipers full speed and then go fast enough to see the rest of the snow on the car flying off to... well... to all the other cars behind you.  So with good winter tires, the white season shouldn't be any problems with the Integra.  

This is also great because of its trunk.  Large enough for all your needs, especially when you fold down the 40/60 back seats.  It then becomes very practical.  Put some wood panels on the side of the car and you got a small station wagon.

The fun factor diminishes a little because of its interior.  The GS is better than the RS version because of the leather seats but still.  The style is just starting to get old, although all the basic stuff you need is there.  Sunroof, electric windows, seats with many adjustments, CD stereo with decent sound, and... and... that's about it.  Nothing exceptional and no gadgets to play with at a red light... but we don't care... we said earlier you were gonna shift for fun at red lights.  
But the interior gains points with the very large and clear speed and RPM indicator.  Easy to read in one quick look.

This car is also less fun for people other than children and small dogs sit in the back.  The roofline is very low back there so you have to get in quite uncomfortable positions to fit.  So on a long trips, be sure to put your smallest friend there or the one you dislike the most.

And a little less fun also,I live in Canada... quite a nice place, not to much criminals and everything.  Well my integra got stolen three times in two years.  Thank god for GPS security systems.

But other than that this car is fun.  Because of its looks, engine, ease of feeling like shumacher, unquestionable reliability and after all that hard driving it will cost less than bringing your girlfriend to McDonalds to put gas in it.
