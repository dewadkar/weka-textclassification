            I bought a 1994 jeep grand cherokee and love it.  It's a truck and is meant to be know as a truck and not as a bmw.  It has four wheel drive handles decently, and preforms pretty good.  It is definitely durable and long lasting.  It's great for what I use it for like an everyday truck and go off roading on the beach in the summer time.  The main thing that i do not like the most is that the spear tire is in the inside in the trunk of the truck.  I have never had any problems with it and it will hopefully never let me down.  It's a good all around truck and preforms well.<br><br>
