            As a previous owner of a 1996 Honda Accord LX Sedan, I was somewhat predisposed to the Accord line.  I'd grown very fond of the ergonomics, design and comfort of the Accord line and felt that perhaps just a little more power, style, and design were what I needed.  I'd looked at other model cars in the same category but kept coming back to the distinction of the Accord.  Especially the EX V6.  That I'd gotten special financing with an extremely low interest rate was just icing on the cake.

Getting in the car, you'll find the seats are leather upholstered and extremely comfortable.  I often drive in excess of 100 miles a day for my job and have yet to find myself uncomfortable.  Coming from the cloth interior of the '96 LX model, these seats were roomier, more "full", and had a highly desired lumbar support.  Electric controls (both driver and passenger) round out the attraction.  I do wish the seats had a more "contoured" bucket-type feel.  That would give it an even sportier feel but I guess that's what the coupe model is for.

The instrumentation is clear and easy-to-read.  The controls, dials, and switches are well lit in the dark and within easy reach.  Audio controls in the left spoke of the steering wheel and cruise control options in the right spoke help keep both hands comfortably on the wheel.  I'd prefer to have a mute button or disc change button here as well but then again, it would have been awkward to have too many buttons on the steering column.

Auto-climate controls are easy-to-use as are the manual settings.  Dials instead of hard-to-turn/easy-to-break-off knobs help keep the focus on the road.  The system fully controls the interior climate quickly (for both heat and air).  When set to heating, the auto control does not send hot air blasting out the center vents.  Instead in comes from the sides and below.  Much nicer than a face full of stale hot air.

The 6 disc, in-dash CD player is a marvel.  It's easy to use, simple to navigate and plays both commercial CDs as well as CD-Rs and CD-RWs.  The unit also play cassettes and of course standard AM/FM with numerous presets available on each.  The speaker system is good as well although I wish there were more than just bass and treble controls.  Manually changing radio stations can be problematic since the dial increments are so small.  But, I rarely need to make manual adjustments here so it's not a concern.

The split center console is great for quick access storage items on top and the lower portion is great for extra CDs, or other bulkier items.  The glove box is nearly enormous and stores quite a bit.  The extended center console is easily accessible as well.  The trunk is enormous as well.  I'm sure most anything you'd want or need in a passenger car would fit here.  In short, there's a lot of storage- even pockets behind both front seats and in all four doors.

The car starts quickly and is immediately responsive.  A quick shift and you're off and running.  This car- despite it's weight- can move...fast!  I've done some "testing" :-) and easily gone from 40 MPH to just over 95 without any hesitation from the engine.  In fact, even at that speed, there still feels like there's room for more.  It handles well, grips the road tight, and gives you a calming sense of safety.  And on most California freeways, that's not a feeling easily obtained.  But this power is not obtained without a tradeoff in fuel economy.  Averaging about 25 MPG (city and highway combined) has been a change from the economic 4 cylinder I had before.

Road noise, while an issue in most any car, is low unless of course the sunroof cover is open.  Otherwise, it's a respectable volume for typical conversations.  In fact, I've used my cell phone's built-in speakerphone and most callers don't even know I'm in a car!

Dual front air bags, side impact air bags, and anti-lock brakes are all great safety features to have.  I feel comfortable, safe, and secure in this car.  It's my first "off-the-lot" purchase and I'm loving every moment of it.

A great car, well designed, comfortable, and a joy to drive.
